HEARING CHARTER

SUBCOMMITTEE ON TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

An Overview of

Transportation R&D:

Priorities for Reauthorization

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2009

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

I. Purpose

On  Thursday,  February  12,  2009,  the  Subcommittee  on  Technology  and  Innova-
tion  will  convene  a  hearing  to  review  the  research,  development,  and  deployment
activities  of  the  Department  of  Transportation.  The  hearing  will  focus  on  issues  re-
lated to the funding, planning, and execution of current research initiatives and how
these  efforts  fulfill  the  strategic  goals  of  both  federal  and  State  Departments  of
Transportation,  metropolitan  transportation  organizations,  and  industry.  With  the
expiration  of  SAFETEA–LU  in  FY  2009,  this  hearing  will  also  examine  possible
ways to improve the current federal transportation effort.

II. Witnesses
The Honorable Paul Brubaker is a former Administrator of the Research and In-
novative Technology Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Dr.  Elizabeth  Deakin  is  the  Director  of  the  University  of  California  Transpor-
tation Center at the University of California, Berkeley.
Mr.  Robert  E.  Skinner,  Jr.  is  the  Executive  Director  of  the  Transportation  Re-
search Board.
Mr. David Wise is the Acting Director of Physical Infrastructure Issues at the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office.
Mr.  Amadeo  Saenz,  Jr.  is  the  Executive  Director  of  Texas  Department  of  Trans-
portation.

III. Overview

Signed  in  2005,  the  Safe,  Accountable,  Flexible,  Efficient,  Transportation  Equity
Act:  A  Legacy  for  Users  (SAFETEA–LU)  (P.L.  109–59)  authorized  a  total  of  $2.227
billion through FY 2009 for research and related programs under Title V of the bill.
This  Title  authorizes  surface  transportation  research  by  the  Federal  Highway  Ad-
ministration  (FHWA),  training  and  education  programs,  the  Bureau  of  Transpor-
tation  Statistics,  the  University  Transportation  Centers  (UTCs),  and  Intelligent
Transportation  Systems  (ITS)  Research.  The  Science  and  Technology  Committee’s
jurisdiction over surface transportation research and development is based on House
rules  which  grant  the  Committee  jurisdiction  over,  ‘‘Scientific  research,  develop-
ment, and demonstration, and projects therefore’’ and legislative precedent. Jurisdic-
tion over these programs is shared with the Transportation and Infrastructure Com-
mittee. The Science and Technology Committee has a long referral history regarding
surface transportation research and development (R&D) bills, including H.R. 860 in
the  105th  Congress  and  H.R.  242,  and  H.R.  243  in  the  109th  Congress.  Elements
of each of these bills were incorporated in the highway reauthorization bills for the
respective Congresses.

IV. Issues and Concerns
Planning,  Coordination,  and  Evaluation  of  Research,  Development,  and  Technology

(RD&T)

Despite  the  creation  of  a  specific  RD&T  coordinating  agency  within  Department
of  Transportation  (DOT)  by  the  Mineta  Act  of  2004  (P.L.  108–426),  and  require-
ments  in  the  Transportation  Equity  Act  for  the  21st  Century  (TEA–21)  (P.L.  105–
178)  and  SAFETEA–LU  that  DOT  evaluate  and  coordinate  its  research  programs,
efforts in this regard continue to fall short. In 2003, the Government Accountability
Office  (GAO)  evaluated  the  coordination  and  review  efforts  by  the  Research  and
Special Programs Administration (RSPA).1 RSPA had been created by the Secretary
of  Transportation  to  coordinate  and  review  RD&T  activity  across  the  modal  agen-
cies.  It  was  dissolved  when  the  Mineta  Act  created  the  Research  and  Innovative
Technology  Administration  (RITA)  to  fulfill  largely  the  same  functions.  In  the  2003
report,  GAO  found  that  efforts  to  locate  duplicative  programs  and  opportunities  for
cross-collaboration between the modal agencies were hampered by a lack of informa-
tion  on  the  RD&T  activities  being  pursued  across  the  modal  agencies.  GAO  also
found that DOT did not have a systematic method for measuring the results of fed-
eral  transportation  research  activities,  or  a  method  to  show  how  their  research  im-
pacted  the  performance  of  surface  transportation  in  the  U.S.  RSPA  cited  a  lack  of
resources  to  perform  these  types  of  evaluations,  and  they  also  stated  that  each
modal  agency  undertook  its  own  evaluation  of  its  research  programs.  GAO  rec-
ommended  that  RSPA  define  metrics  to  evaluate  the  outcomes  of  its  DOT-wide
RD&T  coordination  efforts.  In  2006,  GAO  did  a  follow-up  evaluation  of  RD&T  co-
ordination and evaluation.2 They again offered similar recommendations, noting the
continuing  lack  of  common  performance  measures  for  DOT  RD&T  activities.  How-
ever,  at  the  time  of  that  evaluation,  RITA  had  just  recently  been  established.  GAO
commended  the  initiative  in  RITA’s  FY  2007  budget  request  to  devote  $2.5  million
to RD&T coordinating activities (an increase of nearly $2 million over the $536,000
spent by RSPA in FY06 on coordination).

In  November  of  2006,  RITA  submitted  the  Transportation  Research,  Development
and  Technology  Strategic  Plan  for  2006–2010  to  Congress.  The  Transportation  Re-
search  Board  (TRB),  of  the  National  Research  Council,  evaluated  this  plan  and
noted, ‘‘The strategic RD&T plan for 2006–2010 is a reasonable first effort. It offers
useful  descriptions  of  the  many  RD&T  programs  within  the  Department.  At  the
same time, it is more a compendium of individual RD&T activities than a strategic
plan  that  articulates  department  wide  priorities  and  justifications  for  RD&T  pro-
grams and budgets.’’ 3 According to TRB, the plan lacked stakeholder input and also
failed  to  identify  how  stakeholder  input  would  be  sought  for  strategic  planning  in
research  topic  areas.  It  further  failed  to  articulate  the  role  and  value  of  DOT’s
RD&T  activities;  describe  the  process  used  for  selecting  research  topics  to  ensure
their  relevance,  quality,  or  performance;  describe  the  expected  outcomes  from
RD&T;  and  describe  the  process  for  monitoring  performance.  In  TRB’s  view,  the
plan,  at  a  minimum  should  have  explained  the  extent  to  which  quantifiable  goals,
timetables, and performance measures would be part of RD&T programs.

The major surface transportation RD&T program of the FHWA has received simi-
lar  criticisms  regarding  coordination  and  evaluation  as  DOT’s  overall  RD&T  pro-
gram.  The  program  is  highly  decentralized,  with  research  activities  taking  place  in
five  out  of  the  thirteen  offices  within  the  agency.  In  2002,  GAO  reviewed  FHWA’s
R&D  approach  and  urged  that  the  agency  ‘‘develop  a  systematic  process  for  evalu-
ating  significant  ongoing  and  completed  research  that  incorporates  peer-review  or
other best practices in use at Federal agencies that conduct research.’’ 4 FHWA sub-
sequently  developed  its  Corporate  Master  Plan  for  Research  and  Deployment  of
Technology  and  Innovation,  released  in  2003.  This  document  contains  many  over-
arching principles, such as measuring the performance of RD&T activities, but does
not  provide  specific  mechanisms  through  which  FHWA  will  implement  all  of  them.
It is also unclear from FHWA’s RD&T Performance Plan for 2006/2007 if the many
research projects listed have been evaluated for their use by the transportation com-

munity. Without such analysis, the information portrayed in these documents estab-
lishes outputs, but does not offer any outcomes.

Tech-Transfer

There  is  general  agreement  that  the  transfer  of  technology  and  new  ideas  from
the  R&D  stage  to  deployment  and  adoption  is  slow.  In  testimony  before  this  com-
mittee in September of 2007, FHWA identified some of the contributing factors that
slow the State and local adoption of new transportation technology, including insuf-
ficient information on the benefits versus the costs of new technologies; lack of con-
fidence  in  new  technologies  or  a  lack  of  performance  data;  and  a  lack  of  incentive
mechanisms  to  encourage  the  deployment  of  new  technology.5 TRB  Special  Report
295, The Federal Investment in Highway Research, 2006–2009: Strengths and Weak-
nesses,  notes  the  important  role  FHWA  plays  in  educating  State  DOTs  about  new
technologies  and  encouraging  their  adoption,  noting  such  efforts  as  FHWA’s  activi-
ties to identify, market, and track the deployment of market-ready technologies and
incorporate  a  strategic  plan  for  the  deployment  of  pavement  research  activities.
However, the funding for technology transfer activities at FHWA has suffered in re-
cent  years,  falling  from  $100  million  to  $40  million  after  the  passage  of  TEA–21.
The  report  further  notes,  ‘‘The  missing  element  among  all  of  FHWA’s  deployment
activities  appears  to  be  the  resources  within  the  agency  with  explicit  expertise  in
technology  transfer  and  deployment  that  could  provide  guidance  to  the  various  ef-
forts agency wide [sic].’’ 6

The  Intelligent  Transportation  Systems  program  is  a  well  studied  example  of
transfer and deployment of R&D efforts. In 2005, GAO identified broad issues with
DOT’s  deployment  goals  for  traffic  management  ITS,  finding  that  the  goals  did  not
take  into  account  the  level  of  ITS  needed  to  accomplish  local  objectives  and  prior-
ities;  did  not  reflect  whether  localities  were  operating  the  ITS  as  intended;  and  did
not  adequately  capture  the  cost-effectiveness  of  ITS.7 Additional  studies  of  ITS  de-
ployment  have  found  that  local  officials  are  aware  of  ITS  technologies  but  feel  that
the benefits are not adequately described.8

Recommendations from TRB

With  support  from  FHWA,  TRB’s  Research  and  Technology  Coordinating  Com-
mittee  (RTCC)  has  periodically  assessed  the  state  of  highway  research  and  made
recommendations  to  policy-makers.  In  its  recent  report,  TRB  Special  Report  295,
The  Federal  Investment  in  Highway  Research,  2006–2009:  Strengths  and  Weak-
nesses,  the  RTCC  evaluated  the  investments  in  highway  R&D  made  under
SAFETEA–LU.  According  to  the  report,  transportation  R&D  is  significantly  under
funded when compared with the R&D investments made in other industrial sectors.
Also, the report recommended that the matching requirement for UTCs be adjusted
from 50 percent to 20 percent. According to the RTCC, if UTCs relied less on State
DOTs  and  others  for  matching  funds,  they  would  be  free  to  pursue  longer-term  ad-
vanced research topics and move away from applied research that could be handled
elsewhere.  The  RTCC  recommended  that  FHWA’s  Exploratory  Advanced  Research
Program  continue  as  well,  and  that  a  larger  percentage  of  the  agency’s  research
budget  go  toward  advanced  research.  Additionally,  the  report  states  that  all  re-
search grants, including those to UTCs, should be made on a competitive, merit-re-
viewed  basis.  The  RTCC  recommended  that  FHWA  be  given  more  resources  to  en-
gage  stakeholders  and  carry  out  technology  transfer  activities.  FHWA  should  be
given the resources to take the lead in establishing an ongoing process whereby the
highway community can set these priorities. Finally, the RTCC noted that the Stra-
tegic  Highway  Research  Program  2  (SHRP  2)  was  funded  significantly  less  than
stakeholders  had  requested,  and  recommended  that  it  continue  to  receive  funding
for another two years. TRB states many recommendations but does not provide spe-
cific mechanisms to accomplish them.

V. Background
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)

6

The  Federal  Highway  Administration  oversees  surface  transportation  infrastruc-
ture  planning,  construction,  and  maintenance;  develops  educational  and  training
programs for transportation workers; and funds research efforts in surface transpor-
tation  fields.  Within  FHWA,  the  Office  of  Research,  Development,  and  Technology
directs the Administration’s transportation research efforts.

Office of Research, Development, and Technology

The  Office  of  Research,  Development,  and  Technology  funds  research  into  pave-
ments,  structures,  safety  initiatives,  highway  operations,  and  environmental  inter-
ests.  The  Office  of  Research,  Development,  and  Technology  directs  most  of  the  re-
search funds for DOT and operates the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center.

• Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC)

TFHRC  operates  as  the  hub  for  highway  research  by  developing  research
plans  in  support  of  FHWA  strategic  goals;  managing  policy,  budget,  and  ad-
ministrative services for its research customers; and initiating strategic mar-
keting plans to ensure the utilization of highway research.

• Exploratory Advanced Research Program (EARP)

EARP  manages  longer-term,  higher-risk  research  aimed  at  addressing  mis-
sion-oriented technology and knowledge gaps as mandated in SAFETEA–LU.
Intending to react to the call for more long-term research, this program seeks
out projects not directed to solve specific current problems, but to enable ap-
proaches to future transportation questions.

Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA)

RITA is mandated to coordinate, facilitate and review the DOT’s research and de-

velopment activities, including those funded through FHWA.

• Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO)

ITS  JPO  was  created  in  the  Mineta  Act  of  2004  to  take  over  coordination  of
the  Intelligent  Transportation  Systems  program.  ITS  JPO  focuses  on  devel-
oping  transportation  infrastructure  and  vehicles  with  integrated  communica-
tion  systems  intended  to  deliver  up-to-date  information  to  both  drivers  and
decision-makers.  This  information  could  be  used  to  coordinate  State  depart-
ment  of  transportation  emergency  efforts,  relieve  congestion  through  metro-
politan  signal  coordination  and  enable  on-the-go  planning  of  efficient  driving
routes with up-to-date traffic information.

• Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)

BTS  is  a  component  of  the  Research  and  Innovative  Technology  Administra-
tion  (RITA)  that  collects,  compiles,  analyzes,  and  publishes  transportation
statistics  in  freight,  travel  and  aviation;  transportation  economics;  and
geospatial  issues.  BTS  is  utilized  by  Federal,  State,  and  local  governments;
universities;  and  the  private  sector.  Data  sets  made  available  to  customers
can  include  air  carrier  traffic,  border  crossing,  and  national  freight  move-
ment.

• John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center

A  fee-for-service  organization,  the  Volpe  Center  is  a  center  designed  to  re-
spond  to  issues  brought  forth  to  them  by  Federal,  State,  and  local  govern-
ments; industry; and academia. The Center assists these clients in a number
of  areas  including  human  factors  research;  system  design,  implementation,
and  assessment;  environmental  preservation;  and  organizational  effective-
ness.  DOT  makes  up  about  two-thirds  of  the  Volpe  Center’s  contracted  fund-
ing.

• University Transportation Research

University Transportation Center (UTC) programs support almost 60 univer-
sity-based  centers  that  conduct  transportation  research  in  all  disciplines  and
support educational activities for the next generation of transportation profes-
sionals.  The  centers  are  funded  on  a  50/50  matching  funds  agreement.  Gen-
erally,  the  states  provide  the  matching  funds,  and  while  the  UTCs  are  in-
tended to jointly operate as a multi-modal system focused on the DOT’s stra-
tegic  objectives,  these  matching  funds  often  provide  opportunities  for  State
departments  of  transportation  to  channel  efforts  towards  specific  regional
transportation issues.

• Transportation Safety Institute (TSI)

TSI  is  also  a  fee-for-service  organization  utilized  by  Federal,  State,  and  local
governments;  industry;  and  the  international  community;  that  develops  and
conducts  worldwide  safety,  security,  and  environmental  training.  TSI  focuses
on  education  programs  developed  in  collaboration  with  the  client  organiza-
tions  to  meet  specific  situation  needs.  Training  and  educational  information
is disseminated through publications, websites, seminars, and classes.

The Transportation Research Board

TRB is one of five major divisions of the National Research Council; the principal
operating agency of the National Research Council. TRB receives federal funding to
manage  cooperative  research  efforts  and  issue  published  analyses  of  transportation
policy  and  research  strategy.  Two  of  the  research  efforts  managed  by  TRB  are  the
National  Cooperative  Highway  Research  Program  and  the  Strategic  Highway  Re-
search Program 2.

• National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP)

NCHRP is a program aimed providing solutions to near-term problems in the
transportation  industry  by  tackling  an  annual  list  of  research  topics  devel-
oped  by  State  departments  of  transportation.  NCHRO  is  administered  by
TRB and sponsored by the State departments of transportation in the Amer-
ican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

• Strategic Highway Research Program 2

SHRP  2  is  a  highway  research  program  designed  to  advance  highway  per-
formance  and  safety  for  the  U.S.  highway  system.  This  program  focuses  on
four  areas  of  research  that  were  identified  by  a  TRB-established  committee
of  leaders  from  the  highway  community:  safety,  infrastructure  renewal,  reli-
ability,  and  transportation  capacity.  Funding  is  transferred  through  FHWA
for execution by TRB with an expected program completion date of FY 2009.

Chair  WU.  Good  morning.  This  hearing  will  come  to  order.  Wel-
come to today’s hearing entitled An Overview of Transportation Re-
search and Development: Priorities for Reauthorization.

I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  the  Technology  and  Innovation
Subcommittee’s  first  hearing  of  the  111th  Congress.  This  sub-
committee  was  very  productive  in  the  110th,  moving  the  Small
Business  Innovative  Research  Program  Reauthorization,  Green
Transportation Legislation, the 10,000 Trained by 2010, Health In-
formation  Technology  Education  Reauthorization—I  am  sorry—
Legislation,  and  the  U.S.  Fire  Administration  Reauthorization  and
the National Institute of Standards and Technology portions of the
COMPETES  Act.  I  am  certain  that  we  can  maintain  this  quick
pace  in  the  111th  Congress,  and  it  is  my  intention  to  do  so  on  a
basis  where  both  sides  of  the  aisle  will  be  participating  vigorously
in these processes.

And  first  up  on  our  agenda  and  the  subject  of  this  first  hearing
is  Surface  Transportation  Research  and  Development  in  prepara-
tion  for  the  Surface  Transportation  Reauthorization  Bill.  I  can
think of a no more appropriate topic for this subcommittee to begin
with  as  Congress  concludes  debate  on  an  economic  stimulus  pack-
age that includes multi-billions of dollars for surface transportation
projects.

As  we  start  these  and  other  major  infrastructure  initiatives,  we
all  agree  that  we  should  deploy  the  most  recent,  efficient,  proven
surface  transportation  technologies  to  ensure  that  we  are  building
the  highways  of  the  past—I  am  sorry—the  highways  of  the  future
and not of the past. Today’s hearing is an overview, an assessment
of  our  current  R&D  investments,  their  coordination,  and  their
focus.  This  will  be  the  first  in  a  series  of  hearings  as  this  sub-
committee develops a surface transportation title that will later be
incorporated into the comprehensive Surface Transportation Bill.

In reviewing some of the Transportation Research Board’s recent
assessments of our surface transportation investments, I am some-
what concerned that the recommendations focus on increased fund-
ing as the sole means to overcome the challenges identified, includ-
ing  slow  technology  transfer  and  a  lack  of  clear  national  priorities
in  DOT’s  (Department  of  Transportation’s)  R&D  spending.  More
money is sometimes necessary. It is difficult in our current environ-
ment,  and  sometimes  it  is  not  a  solution  to  a  lack  of  coordination
or a lack of focus.

What I hope to learn today, and in this series of hearings, is how
to make our federal investments in surface transportation research
and  development  as  effective  and  as  efficient  as  possible  in  over-
coming  the  challenges  of  congestion  mitigation  and  its  impact  on
our lives and on the external environment.

I  want  to  thank  our  panel  of  witnesses  for  taking  the  time  from

their busy schedules to be with us today.

Now I would like to recognize my colleague from Nebraska, Rep-

resentative Smith, for his opening statement.

Welcome  to  today’s  hearing  entitled  ‘‘An  Overview  of  Transportation  R&D:  Prior-

ities for Reauthorization.’’

I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  the  Technology  and  Innovation  Subcommittee’s
first  hearing  of  the  111th  Congress.  This  subcommittee  was  very  productive  in  the
110th,  moving  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  program  reauthorization,
green  transportation  legislation,  the  10,000  Trained  by  2010  health  information
technology  education  legislation,  the  U.S.  Fire  Administration  reauthorization,  and
the National Institute of Standards and Technology portion of the COMPETES Act.
I am certain we can maintain this pace in the 111th Congress.

Our first hearing focuses on surface transportation research and development pro-
grams, in preparation for the surface transportation reauthorization bill. I can think
of  no  more  appropriate  topic  for  this  subcommittee  to  begin  with,  as  Congress  de-
bates  an  economic  stimulus  package  that  contains  $30  billion  for  surface  transpor-
tation  projects.  As  we  commence  this  major  infrastructure  initiative,  we  all  agree
that  we  should  deploy  the  most  recent  and  proven  surface  transportation  tech-
nologies  to  ensure  we’re  building  the  highways  of  the  future,  not  the  highways  of
the past.

Today’s  hearing  is  an  overview  and  assessment  of  our  current  R&D  investments.
This will be the first in a series of hearings as the Subcommittee develops a surface
transportation  title  that  will  later  be  incorporated  into  the  comprehensive  surface
transportation bill.

In  reviewing  some  of  the  Transportation  Research  Board’s  recent  assessments  of
our  surface  transportation  investments,  I  have  been  disappointed  by  their  rec-
ommendations  that  focus  on  increased  funding  as  the  means  to  overcome  the  chal-
lenges they identify, including slow technology transfer and a lack of clear national
priorities  in  DOT’s  R&D  spending.  I  don’t  think  more  money  is  a  practical  or  real-
istic recommendation in our current economic environment.

What  I  hope  to  learn  today,  and  in  this  series  of  hearings,  is  how  to  make  our
federal investments in surface transportation R&D as effective and efficient as pos-
sible  in  overcoming  the  challenges  of  congestion  mitigation  and  its  impact  on  the
environment.

I want to thank our panel of witnesses for taking the time from their busy sched-

ules to appear for us today.

ment.

And  now  I  would  like  to  recognize  Representative  Smith  for  his  opening  state-

Mr.  SMITH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  It  is  a  pleasure  to  return  to
business today, and I look forward to a productive and collaborative
111th Congress on this subcommittee.

The  economic  challenges  facing  our  nation  are  of  utmost  impor-
tance  to  us  all.  We  must  ensure  our  nation’s  citizens  have  the  op-
portunity  to  create  and  innovate.  We  must  support  entrepreneur-
ship  and  see  that  businesses  are  allowed  to  become  more  nimble,
more  efficient,  and  more  competitive.  I  believe  the  Subcommittee
on  Technology  and  Innovation  will  take  an  active  role  in  shaping
our economic recovery and certainly competitiveness.

I  look  forward  to  working  closely  with  you,  Mr.  Chair,  and  the
rest  of  my  colleagues  on  the  Subcommittee  in  accomplishing  this
task.

The  agencies  we  oversee  on  this  subcommittee  are  vital  to  the
Nation’s health and well-being. The National Institute of Standards
and Technology performs cutting-edge research which supports the
next  generation  of  computers  and  electronics,  the  next  generation
of  fuel-efficient  vehicles,  and  the  next  generation  of  health  care
technologies.  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  continues  to
perform  lifesaving  work  to  ensure  our  safety  and  security,  and  the
Department of Transportation supports the highways and railways
vital to our commerce and way of life.

Chair  Wu,  we  have  a  lot  of  work  ahead  of  us  certainly,  and  all
of these agencies may see funding increases due to a stimulus plan
and all will need to have close oversight to ensure we are spending
taxpayer  dollars  wisely.  I  am  happy  our  first  hearing  of  the  year

addresses  one  of  the  major  challenges  facing  our  nation  in  Con-
gress this year; infrastructure research and development.

We  are  currently  contemplating  spending  billions  of  dollars  on
highway and railway infrastructure improvements. We will need to
ask  important  questions  in  order  to  address  the  issues  facing  our
nation’s  aging  infrastructure.  How  will  these  projects  incorporate
science and technology to extend the life of and improve the quality
of our transportation networks? How have our R&D programs per-
formed over the past several years, and what can we do to improve
them?

We expect most R&D to be relevant to the problems at hand and
expect  research  agencies  to  focus  on  the  real-world  outcomes  of
such  research.  The  witnesses  before  us  today  all  have  expertise  in
translating  results  from  the  lab  to  the  road.  I  would  like  to  thank
you  all  for  coming  today  and  sharing  your  thoughts  on  how  to  im-
prove  our  transportation  networks  and  our  research  activities.  I
look  forward  to  starting  a  dialogue  with  you  during  the  question
and  answer  portion  of  today’s  hearing  and  hope  you  will  continue
to work with us as we craft a new highway bill.

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  Again,  it  is  a  pleasure  to  serve  as  Rank-
ing Member of this subcommittee, and I look forward to continuing
this bipartisan and productive relationship. I yield back.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Mitchell follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Today  we  will  discuss  surface  transportation  research  and  development  funding,

planning, and execution.

Surface transportation research and development is critical as the population con-

tinues to grow and congestion continues to increase.

Take  Arizona,  for  example,  which  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  states  in  the  Na-
tion.  Since  1970,  our  population  has  more  than  tripled.  The  Phoenix  metropolitan
area, long the largest in our state, is now one of the largest in the Nation.

Not  surprisingly,  all  this  growth  has  created  an  urgent  need  for  new  transpor-

tation infrastructure and congestion mitigation efforts.

The Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) has been a leader in transpor-
tation  research  and  technology  and  has  engaged  in  several  research  efforts  to  im-
prove infrastructure problems such as monitoring and managing congestion and ex-
perimenting with pavement materials.

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about how we can encourage the de-

velopment of new technologies and materials.

I yield back.
Chair WU. It is now my pleasure to introduce our witnesses. Mr.
Paul  Brubaker  is  the  Former  Administrator  of  the  Research  and
Innovative  Technology  Administration  of  the  U.S.  Department  of
Transportation. Dr. Elizabeth Deakin is the Director of the Univer-
sity  of  California  Transportation  Center  at  the  University  of  Cali-
fornia,  Berkeley.  Mr.  Amadeo  Saenz  is  the  Executive  Director  of
the Texas Department of Transportation. Mr. Robert Skinner is the
Executive  Director  of  the  Transportation  Research  Board.  And  our
final witness is Mr. David Wise, the Acting Director of Physical In-
frastructure Issues at the Government Accountability Office.

You will each have five minutes for your spoken testimony. Your
written  testimony  will  be  included  in  the  record  for  this  hearing,
and  when  you  complete  all  of  your  testimony,  we  will  begin  with
questions, and each Member will have five minutes to question the
panel.  We  will  go  as  many  rounds  as  there  are  questions  or  we
have time for, whichever arrives first.

Mr. Brubaker, please begin.

STATEMENT  OF  THE  HONORABLE  PAUL  R.  BRUBAKER,

TRANSPORTATION
Mr.  BRUBAKER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  Ranking  Member  Smith,
Vice Chair Luja´n, distinguished Members of the Subcommittee. My
name is Paul Brubaker, and I had the honor of serving as the Ad-
ministrator of the Research and Innovative Technology Administra-
tion  (RITA)  at  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  from
August, 2007, until January 20 of this year.

Oh, I am sorry.
I  am  pleased  to  be  here  today  to  testify  on  what  I  think  is  the
real  tipping  point  in  the  transportation  infrastructure;  how  we  le-

verage  research  going  forward  to  transform  our  transportation  in-
frastructure.

I  have  submitted  written  testimony  as  you  know  for  the  record,
but I would like to highlight some key points in my oral testimony.
During  my  tenure  at  RITA  we  attempted  to  establish  a  process
by  which  research  funding  decisions  were  made,  executed,  and
evaluated,  as  well  as  develop  a  construct  to  actually  manage  re-
search, in portfolios based on multi-modal communities of interest.
We weren’t entirely successful.

However,  we  did  make  significant  progress  in  at  least  estab-
lishing  a  degree  of  transparency  into  the  research  spent  which
hadn’t  been  reached  before.  The  transparency  is  only  the  begin-
ning.  Decisions  where  to  spend  the  1.2  billion  in  research  dollars
must be based on strategic research objectives established in a ho-
listic,  multi-modal,  and  focused  national  transportation  research
agenda  that  covers  all  aspects  of  the  transportation  picture  and
drives innovation into the system.

For all research funded by the Department or through the High-
way  Trust  Fund,  outcome  expectations  and  performance  measures
should  be  agreed  upon  in  advance,  progress  should  be  monitored,
and  performance  should  be  measured  after  the  projects  are  com-
plete. The Surface Transportation Authorization provides us an op-
portunity  to  redefine  how  we  approach  and  conduct  transportation
research in a way that better serves our nation.

Before  asking  for  additional  transportation  research  dollars,  I
strongly  believe  we  must  ensure  that  current  dollars  are  being
spent  wisely.  As  it  stands  right  now  nobody,  and  I  mean  nobody,
can  say  with  reasonable  assurance  or  authority  that  funds  are
being spent wisely or in a manner that best reflects the overall na-
tional  transportation  priorities.  We  have  an  opportunity  to  fix  this
optimal  situation  by  creating  a  new  transportation  research  para-
digm.

One  good  place  to  start  is  to  ensure  that  RITA,  and  you  might
naturally  expect  me  to  say  this,  is  both  sufficiently  resourced  and
allowed  to  perform  its  role  that  was  created  under  the  Mineta  Act
to coordinate the research spend for the Department, but more im-
portantly,  to  develop  that  holistic  process  where  the  Secretary  can
select,  control,  and  evaluate  research  in  a  strategic  context  based
on  a  to-be-developed  national  transportation  research  agenda  that
reflects  a  broad  group  of  stakeholders,  ranging  from  states  and  lo-
calities  to  personal  and  commercial  uses  of  our  national  transpor-
tation system, to accident victims, police and first responders, even
economic development officials from states and localities.

I have made other recommendations including the establishment
of the Transportation Advanced Research Projects Agency, the con-
solidation  of  research  functions  under  RITA,  and  funds  set  aside
for innovative research projects that can be carried out by a variety
of  institutions  and  individuals.  Those  are  included  in  my  written
testimony.

I  look  forward  to  a  constructive  discussion  today  on  ways  to  im-
prove  our  transportation  research  to  better  leverage  our  existing
investments and better serve the American public.

Thank you, Mr. Chair.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAUL R. BRUBAKER

Chairman  Wu,  Ranking  Member  Smith,  Vice  Chairman  Luja´n,  distinguished
Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  My  name  is  Paul  Brubaker  and  I  had  the  honor  of
serving  as  the  Administrator  of  the  Research  and  Innovative  Technology  Adminis-
tration  (RITA)  at  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  from  August  2007  until
January 20th of this year and I am pleased to be before you this morning to discuss
lessons learned during my tenure; suggestions on how to improve transportation re-
search; ways in which we can deploy the results of that research; and some thinking
as it relates to the new surface transportation legislation.

Based  on  my  recent  experience,  I  believe  we  have  a  tremendous  opportunity  to
shape a National Transportation Research program that has the potential to trans-
form  how  we  move  people  and  goods  across  the  Nation  and  indeed  re-establish  our
global  position  as  leaders  of  a  new,  innovative  and  efficient  transportation  para-
digm.  In  order  to  achieve  this  lofty  goal,  we  will  need  to  rethink  our  approach  to
transportation research; build on a couple of innovations that I attempted to imple-
ment during my brief term; and establish structural improvements that can ensure
the level of innovation that is often promised but rarely realized.

In your invitation you laid out a series of questions that I will attempt to answer
in  my  testimony  but  with  some  additional  information  that  I  hope  will  provide  a
more complete narrative.

The current transportation research and development investment structure is im-

proving—but what it really needs is a complete overhaul.

Early  in  my  tenure  it  was  clear  that  the  fundamental  legislative  requirements  of
the  Mineta  Act,  which  created  my  office  and  called  on  RITA  to  coordinate  the  De-
partment’s  transportation  research,  were  not  being  met.  While  the  Department  es-
tablished  a  Research  Planning  Council  and  a  Research  Planning  Team—it  could
best  be  described  as  a  loose  governance  process  that  was  only  meant  to  ‘‘rubber
stamp’’ the Department’s $1.2 billion in transportation research money was spent—
with no enterprise level coordination as the law—as I read it—required.

After conducting a pretty quick assessment of the situation I asked RITA’s RD&T
staff  to  establish  a  framework  by  which  we  could  prioritize  transportation  research
investments to better reflect and align to the strategic goals of the Department and
the Administration. I further requested that this framework be based on the Capital
Planning  and  Investment  Control  (CPIC)  processes  mandated  by  OMB  circular  A–
11  for  the  government’s  capital  investments  because  there  were  a  number  of  simi-
larities and the GAO had established a nice corresponding maturity model for orga-
nizations to use in developing and using CPIC for technology investments.

The  framework  that  was  initially  conceived,  originally  known  as  Research  Plan-
ning and Investment Control (RPIC), cannot only prioritize investments, but was de-
signed to monitor and track research outcomes over the life of the project and man-
age  the  research  in  portfolios.  However,  due  to  cultural  resistance  to  change,  the
word ‘‘control’’ in RPIC was changed to ‘‘coordination,’’ the investment prioritization
activities,  the  research  monitoring  plans,  and  the  concept  of  portfolio  management
were  all  scrapped.  The  RPIC  project  was  relegated  to  a  ‘‘pilot’’  program  and  today
is essentially a data base of existing research programs that can be viewed by multi-
modal  communities  of  interest  (e.g.,  human  factors;  materials;  safety  systems)  and
across  the  modes.  While  this  transparency  is  good  and  desirable,  RPIC  was  origi-
nally conceived to do considerably more—it was to serve as a decision support, pro-
gram  management  and  program  evaluation  tool  so  that  we  could  select,  evaluate
and control the underlying research spending in a manner consistent with research
investment criteria.

The  current  incarnation  of  the  RPIC  process  ‘‘buckets’’  existing  spending  to  com-
munities of interest but the actual decisions to invest in particular research activity
are  made  almost  exclusively  by  the  modes.  Consequently,  the  current  spending  of
the Department’s research resources is not subject to a systematic Department-wide
prioritization.  This  spending  is  most  often  aligned  with  the  wishes  of  a  number  of
key  stakeholders  in  each  of  the  modes,  or  in  some  cases  is  the  result  of  a  Congres-
sional  earmark  but  the  Department’s  portfolio  of  transportation  research  does  not
represent  a  comprehensive,  holistic  program  that  supports  an  overall  National
Transportation Research Agenda.

The University Transportation Centers represent approximately $70M of research
spending  each  year.  It  is  the  one  program  where  RITA  has  complete  visibility  over
the  research  spending  and  reviews  the  strategic  plans  for  consistency  with  the  De-
partment’s  overall  strategic  plan.  Given  the  mission  of  the  UTC  program—to  train
the  next  generation  of  transportation  leadership—there  is  strong  evidence  that  the
program is meeting that goal.

Clearly,  we  need  to  improve  the  current  transportation  R&D  investment  struc-
ture.  My  suggestion  would  be  to  start  over.  Begin  with  the  development  of  a  Na-
tional  Transportation  Research  Agenda.  This  agenda  should  take  a  comprehensive,
holistic,  multi-modal  view  of  our  transportation  system  and  receive  input  from  the
Congress,  Administration,  transportation  system  user  communities  and  all  stake-
holders—not  just  the  ones  with  the  deepest  pockets—and  establish  and  outline  the
key  objectives  and  desired  outcomes  of  our  transportation  system.  It  should  then
clearly  map  research  programs  and  spending  to  the  outcomes  and  goals  outlined  in
the  plan  and  clearly  describe  how  these  projects  will  help  us  achieve  our  goals  and
achieve our desired outcomes.

Once that agenda is established, a governance process—much like that originally
conceived  for  the  RPIC—explicitly  supported  by  the  Secretary  and  managed  on  be-
half of the Secretary by RITA, should examine all of the research programs and pro-
posals that receive any direct or indirect federal dollars, and only those that are con-
sistent  with  the  goals  of  the  National  Transportation  Research  Agenda  should  be
funded.  Those  that  are  funded  should  be  monitored  and  evaluated.  A  dedicated  of-
fice  of  technology  transfer,  perhaps  within  RITA,  could  help  ensure  that  the  rel-
evant,  valuable  knowledge  (for  both  successful  and  unsuccessful  projects)  is  shared
and  when  appropriate,  that  successful  innovations  are  commercialized  and/or  gen-
erate new levels of research.

The  Department,  through  RITA,  should  also  act  as  a  facilitator  of  knowledge
through the use of advanced collaboration capabilities that would allow researchers
to  self-organize  around  communities  of  interest.  During  my  tenure,  we  attempted
the  creation  of  such  an  environment—think  Facebook  for  the  transportation  re-
search  community—that  would  make  knowledge  sharing  and  technology  transfer
much  more  convenient  and  effective  as  collaboration  and  reporting  could  be  accom-
plished virtually. Those not wishing to share results until the research projects are
completed  could  create  password  protected  work  spaces  that  would  restrict  access
only  to  those  working  on  the  project.  While  at  RITA,  we  built  the  first  generation
of  this  collaborative  capability  at  www.transportationresearch.gov.  It  is  only  the  be-
ginning of what could become an interesting new paradigm in research collaboration
and ironically may bring the Internet back to its roots.

Our  ability  in  the  transportation  research  community  to  successfully  transfer,
commercialize  and  deploy  new  methods,  innovations,  and  technology  must  be  re-
focused.  Currently,  there  is  no  systematic  or  focused  program,  process  or  set  of  ac-
tivities  that  are  driving  innovations  out  of  the  laboratory  and  onto  our  Nation’s
roads,  rails,  runways  or  waterways.  Most  in  the  community  believe  that  effective
technology  transfer  only  involves  having  researchers  share  their  research  by  pub-
lishing  peer  reviewed  articles  in  transportation  research  journals  or  presenting  pa-
pers  at  conferences.  Researchers  communicating  with  other  researchers  is  a  valu-
able  way  to  share  knowledge—it  is  also  a  sure  fire  way  to  ensure  that  these  ad-
vances or ideas rarely get commercialized.

We  must  focus  on  a  new  model  and  process  to  achieve  technology  transfer  that
leads  to  commercialization  and  deployment  of  new  transportation-related  tech-
nologies.  Unfortunately,  we  may  miss  a  prime  opportunity  to  drive  innovation  into
the  transportation  infrastructure  through  the  stimulus  spending  but  it  may  be  an
order too difficult to fill in short order.

Only a new approach to technology transfer and commercialization that is focused
on  transparency,  openness,  and  a  systematic  way  to  communicate  with  a  broader
set  of  industry,  entrepreneurs,  investors  and  other  interested  parties  will  succeed
in fostering innovation and ensuring wider-spread deployment of these innovations.
For  years,  this  has  largely  been  an  ‘‘inside  game’’  managed  by  a  relatively  small
group—an  example  of  that  President  Eisenhower  foresaw  in  his  farewell  speech  in
January,  1961—which  virtually  ensures  that  an  innovator  tinkering  in  the  garage
has no chance of getting his or her ideas vetted.

We need to look beyond the universe of traditional gatekeepers and work to facili-
tate  the  timely  testing  and  standards  development  that  would  allow  rapid  proto-
typing,  piloting  and  deployment  of  these  new  technologies.  In  short,  we  must  move
closer  to  technology  development  times  versus  industrial  age  development  cycles.  I
have witnessed a great number of good ideas that are available today—but may not
be deployed for decades to come because of a variety of cultural, structural and sys-
temic  obstacles—mostly  related  to  intolerance  of  risk  and  processes  that  have  the
effect of stifling innovation. This can change. But it will require a collective commit-
ment  and  leadership  that  is  willing  to  deploy  a  systematic  way  of  improving  tech-
nology transfer and commercialization.

As the Congress begins drafting the next surface transportation legislation, it will
have  a  unique  opportunity  to  change  the  focus  from  strictly  ‘‘highways’’  and  direct
spending  and  programs  that  better  reflect  the  way  we  actually  travel.  While  high-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:26 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047544 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\T&I09\021209\47544 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

15

ways  are  indeed  an  integral  part  of  this  equation,  the  view  must  be  significantly
expanded  to  include  or  at  least  accommodate  alternative  modes  for  people  and
freight  to  include  rail,  high  speed  passenger  rail  and  transit,  and  water  transpor-
tation. We even must integrate air as we consider this holistic picture.

The  next  surface  transportation  authorization  must  ensure  that  the  transpor-
tation  research  budget  and  that  of  the  Bureau  of  Transportation  Statistics  is  di-
rectly  aligned  with  the  National  Transportation  Research  Agenda  which  should  be
updated and published every two years by the Research and Innovative Technology
Administration  in  coordination  with  the  Administration,  the  Departmental  leader-
ship, the users of the systems and key stakeholders.

The  budget  should  be  aligned  and  adjusted  based  on  changing  priorities  and  the
portfolio  of  projects  should  be  balanced  according  to  the  priorities  reflected  in  the
agenda. This portfolio should be transparent both within and outside of the depart-
ment  and  the  final  annual  budget  and  program  plan  should  be  public.  This  way,
citizens  from  anywhere  in  the  county  can  examine  the  portfolio  and  its  anticipated
outcomes  and  compare  actual  results  to  anticipated  results.  Such  increased  trans-
parency  may  actually  improve  achieve  deployment  of  these  technologies  and  meth-
ods  as  more  people  and  entrepreneurs  will  have  access  to  the  new  ideas  being  ex-
plored by the Department and its research community.

There is also a clear role for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics but it should
be  much  focused  and  adequately  resourced  to  monitor  the  performance  of  the  Na-
tion’s  transportation  system.  It  must  also  expand  its  role  and  develop  forecasting
models and simulations that can help us drive research proposals as it will help us
better  understand  the  potential  impact  of  alternative  investments  and  research  re-
sults  as  well  as  ensure  that  it  has  the  capability  to  further  our  understanding  of
external events that impact our transportation system. For example, with this capa-
bility  BTS  could  have  been  able  to  model  the  impact  of  fluctuating  fuel  prices  on
our national logistics system and passenger movement system.

Perhaps  not  surprisingly,  I  believe  that  RITA  should  remain  the  Department’s
focal  point  for  transportation  research—but  it  must  be  significantly  strengthened—
this  will  require  a  significant  and  substantial  investment  in  people  and  money.
RITA’s  first  order  of  business  should  be  to  coordinate  the  formulation  of  the  Na-
tional  Transportation  Research  Agenda—one  that  represents  a  cross-modal  and  ho-
listic  view  of  our  national  transportation  system.  This  can  only  be  developed  with
significant  input  from  the  user  community  and  from  stakeholders.  The  research
agenda  must  also  be  multi-  or  intermodal  in  nature  and  not  be  primarily  or  dis-
proportionately  focused  on  highways  to  the  exclusion  of  other  modes—the  only  way
to accomplish this is to provide direct funding.

Then, RITA should establish and manage a governance process that can align and
direct transportation research resources in a manner that is consistent with the Na-
tional  Transportation  Research  Agenda.  RITA  could  build  on  the  RPIC  process  to
achieve  this  goal  but  most  importantly,  the  research  portfolio  should  be  managed
and  evaluated  for  its  outcomes,  results  and  effectiveness  by  developing  transparent
program and project evaluations and lessons learned that can be used to determine
appropriate follow on research and serve as a basis for technology transfer and com-
mercialization of the promising research.

RITA  should  also  continue  to  play  an  active  role  in  overseeing  the  University
Transportation  Research  as  well  as  house  appropriate  multi-modal  research  activ-
ity—such as the Intelligent Transportation System and Alternative Fuels program—
and  should  expand  its  oversight  role  to  include  the  approval  and  oversight  of  any
Department  or  indirect  federal  dollars  going  to  any  University  or  not-for-profit  re-
search entity for transportation-related research. This includes the coordination, re-
view  and  approval  of  any  projects  directly  or  indirectly  receiving  federal  funds  that
are managed by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies.

Although  controversial,  the  Committee  should  examine  the  feasibility  of  consoli-
dating  all  of  the  research  laboratories  within  the  Department.  These  could  be  cen-
trally  managed  by  RITA  or  at  a  minimum  be  subject  to  strict  oversight  by  RITA
to ensure that their activities are consistent with and achieving the objectives of the
National  Transportation  Research  agenda.  Currently,  a  number  of  the  modes  have
research  labs  dedicated  toward  performing  transportation  research.  For  example,
the  Turner-Fairbank  Highway  Research  Center  in  Virginia  currently  performs  a
great deal of highway related materials and systems research. In many cases, simi-
lar  if  not  identical  research  is  also  being  conducted  at  a  number  of  universities—
some  of  which  is  funded  by  the  Federal  Highway  Administration.  While  it  may  be
appropriate  in  some  cases  to  validate  research  results,  I  believe  the  resistance  to
visibility and oversight as well as the failure of the Department to drive toward bet-
ter  management  of  the  research  portfolio  continues  to  encourage  research  redun-
dancy and waste.

Finally, I would like to suggest that a certain portion of the Department’s Trans-
portation  Research  funding—at  least  half—go  toward  advanced  systems  research—
and  directed  by  RITA  consistent  with  the  National  Transportation  Research  Agen-
da.  I  would  propose  that  the  majority  of  the  funding  be  used  to  establish  a  Trans-
portation  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency.  The  balance  of  the  funds  should  be
used  for  worthy  projects  proposed  by  the  Volpe  National  Transportation  Systems
Center,  Turner-Fairbank,  The  Transportation  Research  Board,  Universities  and
other  potential  worthy  and  qualified  grantees  including  those  who  tinker  in  their
garages.

Thank you for the opportunity to present the ideas to you this morning and I look

forward to answering any questions you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR PAUL R. BRUBAKER

Paul Brubaker recently joined Cisco Systems, Inc. as leader of its North American

public sector team in the Internet Business Solutions Group (IBSG).

Paul has an unusual blend of public and private sector experience. He has served
in both the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. Federal Government. Dur-
ing his service in legislative branch, Paul worked for the General Accounting Office
and eventually became Minority Staff Director of the Senate Subcommittee on Over-
sight  of  Government  Management  where  he  worked  on  a  number  of  reform  efforts
including  leading  the  effort  that  resulted  in  passage  of  the  Information  Technology
Management Reform Act linking federal investment in technology to measurable im-
provements in mission performance and establishing CIO positions in major federal
agencies.

In  1998,  Paul  was  appointed  by  President  Clinton  to  serve  as  Deputy  Assistant
Secretary  of  Defense  and  Deputy  Chief  Information  Officer  and  in  2007  he  was  ap-
pointed  by  President  Bush  and  confirmed  by  the  Senate  to  serve  as  the  Adminis-
trator for Research, Innovation and Technology at the U.S. Department of Transpor-
tation.

In  the  private  sector,  Paul  founded  two  successful  small  businesses  and  has
worked in a number of senior strategy positions with government contractors includ-
ing:  Litton  PRC;  Commerce  One;  and  SI  International.  At  SI  international,  he
served  as  Executive  Vice  President  and  led  the  government  and  investor  relations
activities while serving as Chief Marketing Officer where he also re-engineered and
automated a number of sales and proposal processes. While at Commerce One, Paul
led  a  management  buy-out  of  the  firm’s  public  sector  professional  services  unit
which he took private.

In his spare time, he has served as the Chairman of the Virginia Innovative Tech-
nology  Authority,  Chairman  of  the  Technology  Committee  of  the  International
Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, and as a board member
of the Churchill Centre.

STATEMENT OF DR. ELIZABETH DEAKIN, PROFESSOR OF CITY
AND  REGIONAL  PLANNING;  DIRECTOR,  UNIVERSITY  OF
CALIFORNIA  TRANSPORTATION  CENTER,  UNIVERSITY  OF
CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY
Dr.  DEAKIN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  I  was  asked  today  to  speak
about some research that we did at the University of California on
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and let me start with——

Chair WU. Dr. Deakin, is your microphone on?

Chair WU. Yes.
Dr. DEAKIN. Okay. I would like to talk to you about the research
findings  from  our  study  of  Intelligent  Transportation  Systems  and
how  to  get  them  into  the  mainstream  in  transportation.  This  is  a
study  that  was  funded  by  CalTrans,  who  had  spent  a  good  deal  of
its  own  money,  as  well  as  federal  funds,  to  invest  in  intelligent
transportation and was concerned about whether they were getting
their dollars’ worth from the projects.

What we found in a series of interviews with decision-makers, as
well  as  with  technology  experts  and  the  decision-makers  both  in
the  public  and  in  the  private  sector,  was  that  while  there  were
some  valuable  gains  in  such  things  as  traffic  signal  timing,  road
tolling,  better  data  collection,  cheaper  methods  for  gathering  data
and  assembling  it,  monitoring  the  systems,  and  managing  them,
there also is a concern among the decision-makers that there really
was  a  need  for  a  tougher,  more  arms-length  evaluation  of  the  cost
effectiveness  of  these  investments,  and  there  also  was  a  need  for
a  business  plan  for  these  investments  that  hadn’t  yet  been  devel-
oped.

And one of the reasons for that was a lack of real focus on insti-
tutions  and  business  budgets  and  costs  and  effectiveness.  This  is
social  science  research.  There  is  a  lot  of  interest  in  what  kind  of
institutions  it  would  take  to  implement  these  kinds  of  strategies.
One of the problems is that we have tried to include deployment
in  ITS  projects,  but  it  has  been  done  by  the  technology  experts,
who  are  not  necessarily  the  experts  in  institutions  and  planning
and policy. And so we have concluded that we need to create a dif-
ferent  framework  and  a  different  set  of  research  foci  that  would
compliment  the  technology  development,  really  help  it  move  into
implementation.  And  that  might  extend  to  new  kinds  of  partner-
ships and oversight that involves the private sector as well as gov-
ernment  to  really  do  a  tough  business  plan  for  these  technologies
as they are being developed.

I was also asked to address the question of University Transpor-
tation  Centers  (UTCs),  something  that  I  have  some  experience
with, having directed the center in Region Nine for ten years. Uni-
versity  Transportation  Centers  do  research,  they  do  tech  transfer,
and  they  produce  graduates.  The  graduates  are  a  form  of  tech-
nology transfer in some ways because they go out into the agencies
and  the  consulting  firms  and  the  private  sector  with  the  latest
knowledge  and  learn  on  the  job  how  to  deploy  that  knowledge.  So
we look at them as an important product.

The Transportation Centers Program expanded greatly under the
last  Transportation  Bill  from  the  original  ten  to  a  total  of  60  cen-
ters  now,  20  of  which  competed  for  their  funds  and  40  of  which
were  selected  by  Congress.  My  own  view  is  the  competition  is  a
very  good  way  to  choose  transportation  centers  because  it  assures
that  the  best  ideas  are  able  to  compete  and  win  in  a  kind  of  mar-
ketplace. I also have to acknowledge, though, that some of the ear-
marked  centers  have  used  that  opportunity  as  a  chance  to  really
show  that  they  could  develop  and  have  developed  and  become  suc-
cessful.

A big issue on both the UTCs and ITS is measuring performance,
and  I  think  performance  has  to  be  measured  on  outcomes,  not  on

inputs, not just on the number of counts of papers produced or dol-
lars  spent,  but  actually  what  has  been  accomplished  that  has
changed  things,  that  has  made  the  transportation  system  better,
cheaper,  faster,  more  equitable,  and  more  environmentally  sound.
And we need to move in that direction quickly.

One way to do that is to increase coordination in research, which
is  the  third  topic  I  was  asked  to  address.  I  think  that  can  be,  and
is  being,  done  much  better  than  it  was  even  a  few  years  ago  be-
cause of investments that the Transportation Research Board, that
RITA,  and  that  others  have  made  in  creating  really  good  websites
where we can coordinate the research and see what everybody else
is  doing.  There  really  is  no  excuse  for  duplication  with  the  kind  of
information that is now being made available.

On  the  other  hand,  I  don’t  think  that  all  projects  that  are  doing
the same thing are duplications. Sometimes we learn by doing mul-
tiple cases, and we really need to be able to do that. So replication
has to be distinguished from duplication, and we will go ahead fast-
er and gain better if we do that.

I  do  think  that  the  strategic  plan  that  Mr.  Brubaker  just  de-
scribed  is  a  critical  element  in  being  able  to  manage  research.  We
have  to  have  a  new  strategic  plan  that  really  represents  the  new
directions in policy that the country is pursuing under this Admin-
istration  and  under  the  changing  information  about  science  and
technology that comes along. We need to keep that plan up to date
and  renew  it,  and  I  think  the  partnerships  have  to  go  beyond  just
DOT.  They  have  to  go  to  other  agencies  in  a  much  stronger  way
than  they  have,  to  agriculture,  to  energy,  to  environmental  agen-
cies, and further, they have to go to the private sector in a stronger
way  than  they  have  because  we  can’t  do  this  alone.  And  we  need
some  new  models  on  how  to  deliver  our  transportation  systems  so
they will be cost effective.

And  so  I  really  think  that  plan  has  to  be  the  starting  point.  It
has to be outcome-focused. It has to be across the board integrating
all  the  ideas  and  issues  that  we  have  to  address  in  the  next  few
years. We need to develop the plan quickly so that we will be able
to have a framework for making decisions on what is a good invest-
ment in research and technology.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH DEAKIN

Millions  of  dollars  are  spent  each  year  on  transportation  research.  How  can  we
be  sure  that  these  investments  are  effective  and  that  the  research  findings  are  re-
flected in transportation decision-making? Here I briefly consider investments in In-
telligent  Transportation  Systems,  in  University  Transportation  Centers,  and  in
USDOT-led  research,  and  recommend  three  strategies  that  could  improve  research
and  its  utility:  more  emphasis  on  social  science  research  to  frame  and  complement
technology-focused R&D; investing in long-term and exploratory research as well as
in  short-term,  problem-solving  studies,  and  framing  research  and  investment  in  a
strategic  planning  and  evaluation  context  focused  on  outcomes  rather  than  project
categories.

A  Bigger  Role  for  Social  Science  Research:  Evidence  from  Studies  of  the

Implementation of Intelligent Transportation Systems

In  a  study  conducted  in  2003,  researchers  at  the  University  of  California  inves-
tigated factors affecting ITS implementation as a ‘‘mainstream’’ transportation plan-
ning activity (Deakin et al., 2002; Deakin, 2006). We conducted a detailed literature

review,  interviewed  fifty-one  leaders  from  a  cross-section  of  California  jurisdictions
and agencies, surveyed 228 California transportation engineers, planners, and tran-
sit  staff  members,  and  had  follow-up  interviews  with  52  of  the  staff  members  and
20 national transportation leaders with expertise in ITS.

ITS  experts  felt  that  ITS  implementation  has  been  slow,  and  attributed  this  to
a  lack  of  knowledge  about  ITS  among  elected  officials  and  the  public,  as  well  as  a
lack of funding specifically for ITS. In contrast, our interviews with California lead-
ers—elected  officials  and  agency  heads—revealed  widespread  familiarity  with  ITS
concepts  and  applications  (though  many  were  irritated  by  ITS  jargon  and  were  un-
willing  to  use  it).  Policy-makers  cited  freight  applications,  electronic  toll  tags,  im-
proved  traffic  signal  systems,  bus  rapid  transit  projects,  and  traveler  information
signage  as  examples  of  ITS  success.  From  the  policy-makers’  perspective,  ITS  ele-
ments  that  are  not  proceeding  well  suffer  from  institutional  and  political  problems
(e.g.,  efforts  to  route  additional  traffic  on  local  arterials  when  the  freeway  is  con-
gested)  or  market  weaknesses  (e.g.,  efforts  to  sell  traffic  information  to  third  party
providers).  Overall,  most  elected  officials  and  senior  policy  staff  members  felt  that
ITS innovations are being implemented at a reasonable pace.

Elected officials were concerned, however, about a lack of good information on ITS
benefits and costs, and some expressed concern that ITS evaluations have been less
than arms-length. A number of leaders also commented that ITS proposals have fo-
cused  too  heavily  on  transportation  system  management  benefits  rather  than  trav-
eler  benefits.  Some  also  argued  that  the  private  sector  should  be  left  to  implement
ITS applications such as traveler information systems.

Respondents suggested that the state DOT should lead by example, implementing
ready-to-go  technologies  on  its  own  facilities  and  within  its  own  agency.  Stronger
partnerships  with  local  government  and  other  State  agencies,  developing  mutually
beneficial,  multi-purpose  applications,  were  recommended.  Finally,  respondents
urged  that  future  ITS  work  should  pay  more  attention  to  legal  and  institutional
issues and provide a clearer sense of ‘‘next steps.’’

Interviews  with  national  experts  identified  additional  issues.  There  was  near-
unanimous agreement that DOTs are having difficulty with ITS implementation be-
cause partnerships are needed to implement and partnerships necessitate a change
in  agency  culture,  including  less  hierarchical  decision-making.  In  the  experts’  view,
separate  ITS  units  and  ITS  implementation  plans  can  foster  strategic  thinking
about  ITS  technology  development  but  may  hinder  ITS  incorporation  into  ongoing
plans, programs, and funding streams. Earmarked funding for ITS was seen as ap-
propriate  for  demonstration  projects,  to  test  concepts  and  provide  examples,  and
when ideas are accepted but resources are low; traffic signal timing, which produces
valuable  cumulative  benefits  but  is  low-visibility  and  typically  a  low  priority  for
local  governments,  was  given  as  a  case  where  earmarked  funds  may  be  needed  to
induce action.

Based  on  these  findings,  we  recommended  a  refocusing  of  applied  ITS  research
across a wider range of applications, as well as greater attention to research on im-
plementation,  including  market  studies  and  work  on  strategies  to  foster  consensus
building and partnerships for ITS.

A  follow-up  study  currently  underway  suggests  that  many  findings  of  our  earlier
work  still  hold  true  (Deakin,  Frick,  and  Skabardonis,  forthcoming).  While  efforts
have been made to increase deployment of ITS, these efforts have continued to focus
primarily  on  technology  details  rather  than  evaluating  the  broader  questions  of
costs  and  benefits,  markets  and  institutions  that  are  also  needed.  Agencies  have
tried  to  address  the  latter  issues  and  bring  greater  attention  to  implementation  by
requiring  ‘‘technology  transfer’’  elements  in  every  project,  but  we  find  that  this  has
been  less  successful  than  the  agencies  had  hoped.  One  reason  is  that  the  assess-
ments  are  often  done  as  an  add-on  to  a  technology  development  or  field  test,  often
by  the  same  staff  members  who  developed  the  technology  or  test.  But  experts  in
science,  engineering  and  technology  are  not  necessarily  expert  in  economics,  policy
design,  planning,  public  support,  and  implementation,  which  are  all  social  science
fields of inquiry. We should not expect that our technical experts will excel at mar-
ket studies, policy analyses, or social, economic, and environmental assessments any
more  than  the  marketing  and  public  policy  department  of  a  technology  firm  would
be  expected  to  do  engineering  and  technology  development.  Investments  in  social
science research are what are needed, especially in the form of independent assess-
ments conducted in consultation with technology developers. Such efforts could help
us match technologies to markets, improve the research selection process, and speed
up implementation of research findings when such implementation is warranted.

University Transportation Centers: Research and Human Resources

20

Since the late 1980s the Federal Government has devoted a portion of its funding
for  transportation  to  university  transportation  research  centers.  Originally  the  fed-
eral program funded ten centers, one per federal region, with center designation de-
termined  through  a  competitive  process  involving  peer  review  of  proposals.  In  the
ensuing  years,  Congress  has  expanded  the  program  several  times,  naming  addi-
tional  centers  but  also  requiring  that  after  an  initial  funding  period,  most  centers
must  compete  for  continued  designation.  Currently  there  are  sixty  centers,  with  20
selected  through  competitive  reviews  and  40  named  in  SAFETEA–LU.  Centers  fall
under several classifications with differing funding levels. Most centers are required
to  secure  a  dollar-for-dollar  ‘‘match’’  for  federal  funds,  and  state  DOTs  and  other
local  transportation  agencies  are  commonly  called  upon  to  provide  this  match.
USDOT’s  Research  and  Innovative  Technology  Administration  (RITA)  manages  the
program with a small but highly effective staff.

All  of  the  UTCs  conduct  research.  The  UTCs  also  support  university  transpor-
tation  degree  programs  and  offer  continuing  education,  conferences,  and  symposia
to help practitioners stay abreast of new methods and findings. However, the UTCs
are  a  varied  group,  ranging  from  top-ranked  research  universities  to  smaller  re-
gional  or  local  universities  oriented  principally  toward  education  and  training.  The
UTCs’ emphases and work products likewise vary.

Most  UTCs  carry  out  a  mixed  portfolio  of  research  projects,  ranging  from  basic,
exploratory  research  to  highly  applied  projects.  Each  center  has  a  strategic  plan
that outlines the areas in which it will concentrate. Most centers also refer research-
ers to the USDOT strategic plan and similar documents that identify research needs
and project ideas. For most UTCs, however, the required ‘‘match’’ has a strong influ-
ence  on  the  projects  selected,  since  State  and  local  agencies  often  will  fund  only
those projects that they view as meeting their pressing, short-term information and
training needs.

California  UTCs  have  been  somewhat  of  an  exception.  California  UTCs  have  had
the benefit of a generous match guarantee since the start of the UTC program, with
Caltrans  staff  participating  in  peer  review  of  research  proposals  but  not  directing
research  selection.  Most  other  centers  have  had  less  flexible  arrangements  and  as
a result do a higher share of short-term, applied projects than the California UTCs.
California has had the ability to provide the UTCs this match and allow them this
flexibility  because  of  the  size  of  its  transportation  program.  However,  with  five
UTCs  now  designated  in  the  state  and  an  increasingly  constrained  transportation
budget, the UTCs have become a significant part of Caltrans’ research expenditures
and  Caltrans  is  feeling  the  squeeze  on  its  funding.  Smaller  states  are  even  harder
pressed  for  research  funds  and  UTC  match  can  eat  up  a  large  chunk  of  available
funds.  Under  these  circumstances,  the  states  understandably  want  to  see  their
funds used to meet their current need and are less interested in longer-term, riskier
research.  Some  are  also  concerned  that  the  growth  of  the  UTC  program  amounts
to de facto ‘‘earmarking’’ of State research funds that the they would otherwise use
at their own discretion.

The  pressure  for  UTCs  to  show  short-term  payoffs  in  ways  that  are  relevant  to
current  agency  problems  is  substantial.  Yet  long-term,  researcher-initiated  studies
can  pay  off  immensely.  Since  the  start  of  the  UTC  program,  California  UTC  re-
searchers have carried out investigations on such topics as strategies for greenhouse
gas  reduction,  new  fuels  and  new  vehicle  technologies,  measurement  and  control  of
particulate  emissions  from  trucks,  freight  logistics,  management  of  traffic  to  and
from ports, congestion pricing, parking pricing, land use-transportation coordination,
outcome-oriented  performance  measures,  and  collaborative  strategic  planning  proc-
esses  (to  name  just  a  few  of  the  topics  studied).  Much  of  this  work  was  initiated
well before there were federal or State transportation policies or research programs
on such matters. One result of this investment in long-term, exploratory research—
research that was NOT clearly tied to existing public policies and programs—is that
the  research  itself  has  helped  identify  new  ideas  and  directions.  It  has  given  Cali-
fornia  a  strong  evidentiary  basis  for  action  and  has  inspired  new  State  legislation
and  new  agency  programs.  As  a  result,  California  is  now  positioned  to  lead  imple-
mentation  efforts  in  key  policy  arenas  that  now  are  attracting  national  attention.
The research might have been risky, but it has given us a distinct advantage in in-
formation and know-how.

At  the  same  time,  the  UTC  program  has  produced  literally  thousands  of  grad-
uates in transportation, at least some of whom would not have entered the field had
UTC-funded fellowships and research appointments not been available. Many of the
graduates from early days are now in positions of leadership and are helping to re-
shape transportation policy and practice. This cadre of young transportation profes-

sionals  is  an  important  product  of  every  UTC  program  and  their  accomplishments
are a key measure of the program’s productivity.

Indeed, a major way that UTCs disseminate research results—their own, and oth-
ers’—is  to  train  graduate  students,  who  then  enter  the  field  armed  with  the  latest
methods and findings which they then introduce into their workplaces.

The  consequences  of  the  proposal  to  change  the  UTC  match  ratio  from  50–50  to
80–20 will depend on the specifics of implementation. If the lowered match require-
ment  is  combined  with  a  cap  on  federal  funding  for  the  UTC  program  at  or  near
existing  levels,  and  the  number  of  UTCs  stays  the  same  or  expands,  both  graduate
student support and UTC research output is likely to decline. The UTC projects that
do get funded are likely to be framed in longer-term, bigger picture terms, and while
riskier,  more  of  these  projects  may  be  of  lasting  consequence.  In  other  words,  less
State  funding  may  mean  less  pressure  for  short-term  applications.  However,  there
will  of  necessity  be  fewer  projects,  fewer  graduate  students  supported,  and  as  a  re-
sult,  a  lower  level  of  infusion  of  new  knowledge  into  the  profession.  Not  all  UTCs
will suffer, of course; the UTCs most successful at attracting funds from the private
sector  and  foundations  will  refocus  their  efforts.  Other  UTCs  will  have  to  contract,
and  issues  of  public  rather  than  private  interest  might  receive  less  attention  than
they do today.

Of  course,  states  could  choose  to  continue  a  research  program  much  as  the  one
they  are  now  funding  through  the  UTCs,  with  consultants  as  well  as  universities
able  to  compete  for  the  available  funds.  Competing  for  these  funds  would  allow
UTCs to offset some of the reduced match ‘‘hit’’ on UTC funding levels.

If on the other hand Congress boosts the program funding to maintain or increase
the funds available to the UTC program, while reducing non-federal match, a great-
er  focus  on  national  objectives  and  on  longer-term  innovation  in  research  could  be
possible.

Congressional  decisions  on  whether  to  designate  more  UTCs  or  endorse  competi-
tion and peer review also will affect the quality and the scope of the UTC program.
Research  universities  have  concluded,  based  on  the  evidence,  that  competition  and
peer review are the best ways to produce quality results. However, in the UTC pro-
gram  it  also  is  evident  that  earmarks  have  allowed  some  universities  to  develop
transportation  programs  that  have  successfully  competed  for  funds  in  later  rounds.
Building  in  an  expectation  of  competition  for  all  centers  after  an  initial  period  of
designated support appears to work reasonably well.

Finally,  multiple  year  grants  are  important  because  they  provide  the  predict-
ability  that  enables  graduate  programs  and  research  programs  to  mesh  well.  Sud-
den  shifts  in  funding  levels  and  expectations  for  match  could  cause  significant  dis-
ruptions  to  graduate  programs,  as  could  delays  in  reauthorization.  Continuing  the
program  as  it  stands  for  at  least  a  year  (rather  than  shorter  periods  that  don’t
match  grant  cycles)  is  a  preferable  option  to  the  difficult  short-term  continuations
we experienced before SAFETEA–LU was enacted.

Coordination of Research Initiatives

Practitioners  and  policy-makers  often  ask  how  we  coordinate  research  programs
funded variously by the USDOT, other federal agencies, the states, foundations and
other  nonprofits,  and  the  private  sector.  The  USDOT’s  Research  and  Innovative
Technology  Administration  (RITA)  has  provided  leadership  in  this  regard.  The
USDOT’s  strategic  plan  provides  a  framework  for  priority-setting  in  research,  and
USDOT and RITA help insure that there is a basic level of information on DOT ac-
tivities  both  by  making  information  on  the  department’s  research  initiatives  avail-
able  on  the  web  and  by  organizing  and  by  reporting  on  collaborations  with  other
departments of the Federal Government (http://www.rita.dot.gov/about¥rita/). On-
line  publication  of  research  results  and  abstracts  in  journals  and  on  university
websites  and  academic/practitioner  conferences  such  as  the  annual  Transportation
Research Board meeting are also important ways to share information.

However,  there  is  more  to  be  done.  Compared  to  the  EU  and  other  economically
advanced  countries,  the  USDOT’s  strategic  plan  is  narrowly  framed;  for  example,
there  is  no  clear  mention  of  global  warming  or  many  other  environmental  issues,
and such matters as transportation’s role in economic development, in social equity,
and  in  quality  of  life  are  not  given  much  attention.  Further,  the  scope  of  the
USDOT’s  collaborations  with  other  federal  agencies  is  quite  limited  and  appears  to
be narrower in some cases than Congress apparently contemplated (e.g., in the Con-
gressionally-requested Transportation Environmental Research Program, which was
recommended  as  a  collaboration  with  other  agencies,  states,  and  the  private  sector,
but was instead instituted as a program within FHWA). U.S. research, development,
and  implementation  practices  also  are  narrower  than  those  of  other  countries  such
as  Canada,  Australia,  or  the  UK,  where  strong  linkages  have  been  forged  among

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:26 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047544 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\T&I09\021209\47544 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

transportation,  housing,  and  economic  development  planning,  and  among  water,
waste disposal, communications and transportation infrastructure investments.

A  big  worry  for  many  public  agencies  is  that  research  will  be  duplicative.  How-
ever,  a  distinction  needs  to  be  made  between  intentional  replication  and  uninten-
tional duplication. Research is often replicated intentionally, or conducted with a se-
ries  of  test  conditions,  to  determine  whether  the  results  are  robust  and  generaliz-
able,  and  not  just  a  fluke  or  limited  to  a  specific  case.  Such  replication  is  highly
desirable because it reduces risk and builds confidence in research findings. On the
other hand, research is published in journals so that other researchers can discover
and evaluate what has been found in previous studies, and avoid unintentional du-
plication.  If  the  latter  occurs,  the  researcher  has  not  done  his  or  her  job  well—it
is this sort of uninformed duplication that should be avoided.

University researchers are evaluated by their peers not only on the quantity they
produce but also on the intellectual content of the products, asking what’s new and
innovative,  what  new  insights  were  generated,  what  linkages  were  identified  that
were previously overlooked, what changed in research directions or in theory, meth-
od, policy, or practice as a result of the work. These are outcome measures.

In  contrast,  many  transportation  agencies  evaluate  the  research  they  fund  only
on  output  measures  (e.g.,  the  main  evaluation  criteria  are  whether  required  prod-
ucts  were  produced  on  time  and  on  budget,  not  whether  the  projects  produced  new
knowledge, altered practice, or improved conditions). The same is true, of course, for
most on-the-ground transportation projects: they are evaluated on design compliance
and  whether  they  are  on  time  or  on  budget  much  more  often  than  they  are  graded
on  whether  they  actually  improved  services,  the  economy,  or  quality  of  life.  Chang-
ing  evaluation  expectations  from  output-focused  to  outcome-focused  could  signifi-
cantly improve the results for all of us, in both spheres of activity.

One  of  the  problems  with  evaluating  based  on  outcomes  is  that  if  negative  out-
comes  automatically  mean  failure,  embarrassment,  and  potential  job  loss,  no  one
will  want  to  admit  to  a  negative  outcome.  Yet  we  know  that  most  new  products
never reach market and only a fraction of those that do are true successes. The pri-
vate sector knows this, and so does academia: ideas that are proven wrong and pro-
posals that fail are nevertheless valuable products for researchers. ‘‘Failed’’ research
efforts can lay the foundation for future research, push it in new directions, suggest
alternative  applications  for  the  failed  product,  and  highlight  challenges  to  innova-
tion. These are valuable lessons, not embarrassments (Zhang and Sternberg, 2006).
Creating  an  environment  where  risks  can  be  taken,  failures  assessed  fairly,  and
rewards  given  when  due  has  been  hard  for  the  public  sector.  This  may  be  a  reason
to  rely  more  on  private  sector  organizations  and  to  give  academics  more  independ-
ence,  and  more  responsibility,  for  R&D.  Risks  and  responsibilities  are  also  reasons
to  promote  competition  and  peer  review;  it  shares  the  risk  and  responsibility  for
both research initiation and research evaluation among a number of experts.

Implications:  Improving  Technology  Transfer  and  Incorporating  Research

Findings into Transportation Investment Policy

Our research speaks to the need to complement technological R&D with research
and  development  in  the  fields  of  economics  and  finance,  markets  and  consumers,
law and institutions, planning and policy-making. This is true with regard not only
to  the  latest  ITS  technologies  but  more  generally  to  all  investments  in  transpor-
tation and other infrastructure.

A  new  USDOT  strategic  plan  may  be  a  way  to  organize  these  efforts.  Work  con-
ducted last year as part of a study on how to respond more effectively to California’s
growth proposed the establishment of a new strategic planning process whose goals
would  be  faster  and  more  cost-effective  delivery  of  infrastructure,  better  manage-
ment of existing facilities and services, better value for money invested, greater ac-
countability  to  customers,  and  the  possibility  of  attracting  private  capital  for  infra-
structure projects (Dowall and Reid, 2008). The strategic planning process would be
focused  on  outcome-oriented  measures  such  as  quality  of  service  and  how  they  are
valued by customers rather than on inputs, e.g., how to allocate categories of funds.
The process would involve creating a vision of the future and the investments need-
ed to attain that future; evaluating a broad set of alternatives including both capital
projects and ‘‘soft’’ investments such as regulation or pricing in deciding what infra-
structure  is  needed;  determining  the  best  way  to  deliver  needed  projects—direct
public or private provision, contracting, partnerships; and providing technical assist-
ance  to  State  agencies  and  local  governments  ranging  from  opportunities  for  bun-
dling  demand  to  information  on  best  practices.  Linkages  modes  (air,  rail,  highway
. . .) and across fields (transportation, energy, housing, agricultural lands, environ-
mental  quality  . . .)  would  be  made  explicit  and  tradeoffs  examined.  Priorities  for
investment would be identified.

Such  a  process,  which  is  being  pioneered  in  several  Canadian  provinces  as  well
as in a few U.S. states, could not only improve transportation investments but could
help governments determine how to allocate scarce resources more effectively. State
plans of similar scope are being developed and could greatly improve State and local
priority setting, investment decision-making, and partnership opportunities.

STATEMENT OF MR. AMADEO SAENZ, JR., EXECUTIVE

DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

Mr.  SAENZ.  Good  morning.  Chair  Wu,  Members  of  the  Science
and  Technology  Committee,  thank  you  very  much  for  the  oppor-
tunity  to  participate  in  this  hearing.  My  name  is  Amadeo  Saenz.
I am the Executive Director of the Texas Department of Transpor-
tation  (TxDOT).  Today  I  would  like  to  accomplish  several  things
with my testimony.

First,  I  would  like  to  give  you  a  State  perspective  on  federal  re-
search investment. I would also like to talk about the barriers that
we  face,  some  of  the  stakeholder  involvement  in  transportation  re-
search and development, and finally, I would like to list some pos-
sible  improvements  that  could  make  research  and  development
more helpful.

Federal  investment  in  transportation  research  and  development
is invaluable to the State DOTs. Because of the federal research we
now  have  high-performance  concrete,  high-performance  steel,  and
accelerated  bridge  construction  methods.  In  Texas  our  highways
are  based  on  design  criteria  developed  through  the  national—
through national research.

We  now  use  cable  barrier  systems  developed  through  the  Na-
tional  Cooperative  Highway  Research  Program.  These  barriers
have  reduced  crash  severity  in  our  highways,  and  this  translates
to  countless  lives  saved.  We  installed,  as  part  of  a  safety  program,
over  400  miles  of  cable  barrier  two  years  ago.  We  went  back  to
evaluate those particular highways, and we saw that we were able
to  save  18  lives  over  that  one  year  and  26  serious  accidents  from
what it was prior. So measuring what you do and what you put in
place is very important.

The  Strategic  Highway  Research  Program  Concrete  and  Struc-
tures Initiative is another federal program we found to be very ben-
eficial.  The  Texas  Loretta  Road  Overpass  in  Houston  was  the  first
project in the country to use high-performance concrete throughout
the bridge. The use of high-performance concrete has allowed us to
realize tremendous savings and efficiency in the construction of our
bridge structures across the state. So far we think we estimate and
we save about $10 to $20 million a year in bridge construction.

In 2002, to demonstrate the impact of that research and develop-
ment has on Texas, on the Texas transportation system safety and
cost  effectiveness,  Texas  DOT  performed  an  analysis  of  21  of  over
200 improved technologies that had been developed through our re-
search  program.  A  benefit  period  of  ten  years  was  used  to  deter-
mine  what  kind  of  returns  we  were  going  to  get,  and  the  findings
showed  that  the  products  provided  a  net  return  of  our  investment
of over five to one. We currently have the Texas Transportation In-
stitute  updating  our  report  because  we  now  have  more  data  on  it,
and preliminary indications are that the original five to one invest-
ment is still a good number.

These  are  just  a  few  samples  of  the  benefits  that  we  have  been
able  to  realize  from  the  transportation  research  and  development,
but like with every other government program there are some bar-
riers.  The  competing  challenges  of  relentless  congestion,  lack  of
adequate  funds,  and  the  need  to  move  people  and  goods  across
towns, across the—and across the country with really—I am sorry.
Excuse me. The competing challenges of relentless congestion, lack
of  adequate  funds,  and  the  need  to  move  people  and  goods  across
town  and  across  the  country  demand  that  we  generate  answers
very  quickly.  We  need  to  anticipate  future  needs  and  begin  re-
search today to address those needs.

One of the largest barriers to overcome in research and develop-
ment  is  to  overcome  the  institutional  inertia  and  resistance  to
change. When we entered these new specifications, new standards,
or  construction  techniques,  we  saw  that  there  is  contractor  resist-
ance,  and  there  are  also  cost  increases  because  of  the  unknown.
There  are  implementing—therefore,  implementing  research  be-
comes difficult due to staffing and funding shortages. And with the
uncertain  economy  that  we  have  today,  the  State  resources  are

stretched just by maintaining our existing systems, and sometimes
research has to take a back seat.

At  TxDOT  all  levels  of  employees  are  involved  in  the  research
and  development  program.  For  example,  we  have  set  in  place  re-
search management committees. These committees are made up of
key  administrative  and  key  lead  people,  district  engineers,  that
work hand in hand with researchers who have the technical exper-
tise  in  the  different  areas.  This  committee  has  established  the  pri-
orities  and  selects  the  research  that  is  to  be  conducted.  We  have
more  employees  involved  in  each  of  the  projects  from  within  the
Department  to  ensure  that  they  work  hand  in  hand  with  the  re-
searchers,  to  ensure  that  everything  stays  on  track  and  will  result
in  information  that  TxDOT  can  use  as  part  of  the  research  pro-
gram.

In  addition,  the  Department  has  also  seen  very  important  to  set
aside money to be able to implement some of the research findings
that  come  out  of  our  research  program,  and  we  put  in  place  a  $5
million  a  year  budget  amount  to  be  able  to  address,  to  implement
these new technologies that come out of our research program.

The  Federal  Government  can  help  states,  counties,  and  cities
with  the  use  of  the  newest  technologies  in  several  ways.  One,  first
you need to understand what the needs of our states are and what
the  needs  of  our  local  communities  are.  Information,  guidance  re-
quirements  developed  at  the  national  level  should  be  provided  in
a ready-to-use format and in an understandable language.

And we must also form partnerships between the federal, State—
federal  and  State  DOTs  to  maximize  and  share  all  of  our  informa-
tion,  our  assets,  and  expertise.  We  need  to  all  work  together  in-
stead  of  all  working  separately  and  independently  and  reinventing
the wheel every time.

Partnership is a major focus for us in Texas. We believe that only
through  partnership  and  coordination  we  will  be  able  to  meet  our
mission,  and  the  same  level  of  coordination  and  focus  would  be
helpful in all federal research programs.

As  Congress  looks  to  reauthorize  the  Nation’s  Surface  Transpor-
tation Program and the research that underpins it, there are some
simple  but  important  changes  that  would  reenergize  the  research
and would cost little or nothing, little or very little to put in place.
Not  since  President  Eisenhower  have  we  had  a  national  plan  for
infrastructure, and if I have to guess, Congress is starting to think
that  we  need  to  have  a  new  national  plan.  Our  national  plan
should  not  only  be  for  highways,  it  should  also  include  all  modes
of  transportation,  whether  it  is  mass  transit,  high-speed  rail,
freight  rail,  aviation,  and  ports.  We  have  to  measure  how  well  we
succeed or how much—by how much we have missed our goals. We
will  need  to  move  into  measuring  real  congestion  relief,  lasting
cleaner  impacts,  safety  improvements,  and  sustainable  mainte-
nance  programs.  That  way  we  know  whether  we  got  what  we  ex-
pected from our research program.

If Congress is serious about making us perform, then a well-orga-
nized  research  program  can  get  us  there.  Congress  should  set  our
goals and then the states and the Federal Government should work
in partnership to define what and how we measure our success. We
need  to  avoid  developing  systems  independent  of  each  other  as  I

mentioned  because  this  leads  to  additional  cost.  A  nationally-co-
ordinated  approach  worked  well  for  mapping  the  Genome  Project,
and it can certainly help us in advancing our research program and
the development of transportation systems.

Mr.  Chair,  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  provide  this  testimony.
I look forward to your questions and will be happy to answer them.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Saenz follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF AMADEO SAENZ, JR.

Introduction

This  testimony  will  provide  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  with  the
State of Texas perspective on the federal research investment, barriers we face, and
stakeholder  involvement  in  transportation  research  and  development.  It  will  also
address the impact to states and possible improvements that might make the entire
R&D endeavor more useful.

At TxDOT we strive to be a progressive State transportation agency that provides
safe,  cost-effective,  efficient,  environmentally  sensitive  and  aesthetically  appealing
transportation systems to the citizens of Texas.

Federal Investment

The federal investment in research and development has impacted transportation
practices  and  investments  in  many  positive  ways.  First,  the  federally  funded  na-
tional programs are the basis for the development of national, State and local oper-
ating  processes,  standards  and  specifications.  These  programs  consolidate  informa-
tion  and  experience 
from  around  the  United  States  and  produce  usable
documentations  for  new  methods.  They  also  obtain  results  that  might  otherwise
take  individual  states  decades  to  complete.  Federal  research  and  development  has
brought  the  transportation  industry  high  performance  concrete,  high  performance
steel and accelerated bridge construction, which have significantly improved the effi-
ciency  and  the  durability  of  bridges.  These,  of  course,  are  not  the  only  examples.
In Texas, the safety devices along all of our highways are based on design criteria
developed  through  national  research.  For  example,  the  National  Cooperative  High-
way  Research  Program  (NCHRP)  Report  350,  ‘‘Recommended  Procedures  for  the
Safety  Performance  Evaluation  of  Highway  Features,’’  has  been  used  for  selecting
cable barrier systems. The installation of these barriers on Texas highways has dra-
matically  reduced  crash  severity  and  saved  several  lives.  NCHRP  projects  have
helped TxDOT in other programs as well, like the repair of prematurely failing mod-
ular  joints  on  bridges.  If  these  systems  are  poorly  designed,  specified  or  installed,
which  had  happened  previously  due  to  a  lack  of  national  specifications,  they  can
under-perform and result in costly bridge damage and premature replacement.

NCHRP has assisted Texas in many ways. It helps us provide secure highway and
bridge  infrastructure  by  presenting  the  results  and  findings  that  enable  transpor-
tation professionals to deal with emergency preparedness functions. The NCHRP re-
ports  also  help  TxDOT  identify  and  quantify  environmental  impacts  in  the  earliest
phases of project planning, making that complex process more effective and avoiding
costly changes later. The research associated with new regulatory requirements can
address  lawsuit  findings  and  help  facilitate  more  efficient  and  effective  environ-
mental clearance and improve project delivery.

Another  great  federal  program  example  is  the  Strategic  Highway  Research  Pro-
gram  (SHRP)  Concrete  and  Structures  initiative,  which  promoted  the  interchange
of  ideas  and  information  among  representatives  of  Federal,  State  and  local  govern-
ment  agencies;  the  construction  industry;  and  the  academic  community,  an  effort
which  provided  High  Performance  Concrete  (HPC).  The  Texas  Louetta  Road  Over-
pass  in  Houston  was  underway  and  was  the  first  highway  bridge  construction
project in the United States to use HPC throughout the bridge.

Additional  benefits  from  SHRP  continue  today.  The  current  Superpave  asphalt
binder  specifications  that  the  Nation  uses  today  were  developed  through  the  initial
SHRP.  For  example,  Expert  Task  Groups,  or  ETGs,  for  binders  and  mixtures  that
were  originally  organized  for  implementing  Superpave  still  function  to  research
changes  needed  in  testing  and  specifications  that  were  not  adequately  addressed
during  the  original  funding  for  SHRP.  The  FHWA  formed  a  working  group  for  the
implementation  of  the  Mechanistic  Empirical  Pavement  Design  Guide  that  is  being
developed to replace the existing American Association of State Highway and Trans-
portation Officials (AASHTO) design guides. The end product should improve the ac-

curacy  and  reliability  of  pavement  design  in  the  United  States.  An  ETG  for  pave-
ment  models  was  organized  to  evaluate  prediction  models  including  fundamental
properties  to  predict  pavement  performance.  This  Long-Term  Pavement  Perform-
ance project was used to develop the new pavement design guide and provided sev-
eral  valuable  lessons  from  the  Special  Pavement  Sections.  FHWA  also  uses  ETGs
to  evaluate  the  measurement  of  pavement  performance  characteristics  such  as
smoothness, rutting and cracking with goals to standardize the practices of calibra-
tion and data collection.

TxDOT has built a very robust research program funded through the federal State
Planning  and  Research  Program  involving  many  of  the  Texas  universities.  We  per-
form  research  in  areas  such  as  pavements,  materials,  construction,  planning,  envi-
ronment,  right  of  way,  public  transportation,  operations,  safety,  hydraulics  and
structures. Some of our recently completed research projects are:

• The Role of Preferential Treatment for Carpools in Managed Lane Fa-
cilities,  which  involved  a  review  of  carpool  preferences  on  managed  and
tolled lanes; a stated-preference survey of HOV lane users with respect to car-
pool preferences relative to price; development of a predictive demand model;
and an assessment of mobility, revenue and environmental impacts.

• Impacts  of  Current  and  Future  Demographic  Trends  on  Transpor-
tation  Planning  in  Texas.  One  of  the  deliverables  from  this  project  was  a
One-Stop  Demographic  Data  Analysis  Tool,  which  will  provide  a  starting
point  for  reporting  and  comparing  demographic  characteristics  of  selected
areas for transportation professionals.

• Synthesis Study of Programs Used to Reduce the Need for Inspection
Personnel.  TxDOT  is  looking  for  more  effective  ways  to  manage  the  work-
load involved in construction project testing and inspection. This project iden-
tified strategies that could help TxDOT do this while maintaining quality.

• Development  of  An  Advanced  Overlay  Design  System  Incorporating
Both  Rutting  and  Reflection  Cracking  Requirements.  TxDOT  spends
millions  of  dollars  each  year  designing  and  placing  overlay  on  its  existing
highways.  The  tools  developed  in  this  study  will  assist  TxDOT  engineers  in
designing  and  implementing  longer  lasting  overlays.  The  software  can  ad-
dress  issues  such  as  where  to  use  high-performance  mixes  and  optimal
thicknesses,  particularly  in  the  area  of  jointed  concrete  pavements  where
joints must be repaired prior to placing any overlay.

A  January  2003  TxDOT  report  titled  ‘‘The  Value  of  Texas  Transportation  Re-

search’’ stated the following:

‘‘To  demonstrate  the  impact  that  research  has  on  transportation  system  safety
and  cost  effectiveness,  21  improved  technologies  and  methods  produced  by
TxDOT’s  research  program  were  selected  from  a  three-year  period,  1999
through 2001. The selected products are considered to be among the best of over
200  beneficial  initiatives  implemented  from  those  three  years  of  the  research
program.  A  benefit  period  of  ten  years  was  used  for  determining  the  returns
from the selected research program products. This is a conservative assumption,
since many benefits never become truly obsolete as newer technology is layered
on earlier innovation.’’
‘‘The  estimated  ten-year  cost  savings  in  department  operations,  stemming  from
these  21  research  products,  are  more  than  $322  million.  The  research  program
budget  total  for  fiscal  years  1999,  2000,  and  2001  was  approximately  $54  mil-
lion  (less  than  0.4  percent  of  the  department’s  budget).  The  total  operational
cost savings derived from these 21 products exceed the cost of the research pro-
gram  by  approximately  $268  million.  This  is  a  net  return  on  investment  ratio
of  5:1,  without  considering  the  value  of  the  numerous  other  products  imple-
mented from that three-year period of the research program.’’

This  report  is  currently  being  updated  by  the  Texas  Transportation  Institute.

However, preliminary indications are that the original findings remain valid.

Research and Development Barriers

The competing challenges of relentless congestion, lack of adequate funds and the
need to move people and goods across town and across the country demand that we
generate  answers  quickly.  In  some  instances,  we  need  the  answers  today—so  we
cannot  wait  on  a  research  question  to  be  posed  with  answers  to  be  presented  two
years down the road. The public expects the best transportation system at the low-
est  cost,  and  research  facilitates  this  but  we  have  to  do  a  better  job  of  anticipating

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:26 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047544 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\T&I09\021209\47544 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

28

our  questions  and  issues.  We  must  begin  research  now  so  we  have  the  answers
available when tomorrow comes.

A  key  barrier  we  have  to  overcome  is  institutional  inertia  and  resistance  to
change  based  on  rational  aversion  to  risk.  Contractors  in  Texas,  as  in  other  states,
are  used  to  standards  and  consistency,  so  when  we  introduce  new  specifications,
standards  or  construction  techniques,  resistance  and  cost  increase  is  certain.  An-
other  barrier  to  implementing  research  is  quite  simply  staffing  and  funding  short-
ages. As you know, there is a cost to implementation and changeover to a new tech-
nology.  With  reduced  budgets  today  and  our  uncertain  economy,  our  resources  are
already stretched in our ability to just maintain our existing systems.

Some  other  barriers  include  failure  to  get  useful  information  to  decision-makers,
reluctance by some to embrace advanced technologies (perhaps due to lack of under-
standing),  lack  of  clarity  or  understanding  of  potential  benefits,  and  unavailability
of  specifications.  Some  research  outcomes  may  have  to  be  validated  by  environ-
mental  regulatory  agencies  and  go  through  rule  making  by  multiple  regulatory
agencies  before  being  implemented  (for  example,  alternative  mitigation  strategies
that  research  has  shown  to  be  superior  to  earlier  practice).  This  barrier  is  exas-
perated by the chronic shortage of staff in the federal regulatory agencies.

Proprietary  issues  continue  to  hinder  implementation.  Frequently,  successful  re-
search must be converted to hardware, software or new materials by vendors before
it can actually be effectively used. Sometimes we must wait to implement a research
result  until  we  have  enough  vendors  for  competitive  bidding.  Manufacturers  are
often reluctant to add new features or applications that resulted from research. An-
other  potential  obstacle  is  that  there  must  be  agreement  on  the  limits  of  the  use
of data available from the new technology (i.e., electronic tolling).

The Federal Government can help states, counties and cities use the newest avail-
able technologies in several ways. First, there must be an understanding at the fed-
eral level of State and local issues and needs. It’s a long way from Washington, D.C.
to  Austin,  Texas,  and  things  can  get  lost  in  translation.  Information,  guidance  and
requirements  developed  at  the  national  level  should  be  based,  where  necessary,  on
sound  research.  This  information  should  then  be  provided  in  clear,  ‘‘ready  to  use’’
format  and  language.  Distributing  reports  that  are  unread  and  put  on  the  shelf  or
stored on the Internet is not the answer. Research results need to be communicated
at all levels. Professionals and first-tier government decision-makers must share the
details of research results and agree on standard processes and methods; i.e., safety
related  road  design,  clearance  zones  and  access  management.  Transportation  de-
partment regional and discipline specialist leaders must agree with local leaders on
the  value  of,  and  the  resources  for,  implementing  research  results;  i.e.,  real-time
monitoring at Traffic Management Centers. Senior transportation leaders and elect-
ed  or  appointed  officials  must  ask  for  and  then  implement  research  on  major  re-
quirements;  i.e.,  alternative  funding  methods,  linking  planning  with  the  National
Environmental  Policy  Act,  global  warming  and  greenhouse  gases.  The  Federal  Gov-
ernment  can  assist  in  developing  specifications  and  standards.  Perhaps  funding
more  demonstration  projects  highlighting  technologies  with  potential  big  pay-off
could also help.

At  TxDOT,  we  have  made  some  changes  in  policy  to  assist  in  overcoming  some
of  these  barriers.  For  example,  deliverables  required  on  some  TxDOT  research
projects  include  a  specification,  standard,  or  ‘‘manual  pages’’  in  the  proper  format
ready  to  insert  into  our  documents.  This  makes  it  easier  and  quicker  to  implement
the  results.  Some  research  project  results  are  such  that  a  formal  implementation
project  is  developed.  An  implementation  project  is  typically  triggered  by  the  need
for  specific  funding  to  help  integrate  a  product,  new  method  or  process,  or  innova-
tion into department operations. Examples include:

tion or maintenance operations.

• The  incremental  cost  for  the  first  use  of  a  product  or  innovation  in  construc-
• The purchase of newly developed equipment for use in the field.
• Training of field personnel in the use of new equipment or methods.

Training is also a significant tool for ensuring that planning and construction use
the  newest  available  technologies.  Universities  must  also  maintain  strong  research
programs  to  attract  high  quality  students  to  continue  graduate  level  study.  Con-
tinuing research progress must be matched with money, resources and materials to
understand  and  implement  new  technologies.  Basic  and  continuing  education  and
technical  skills  training  at  multiple  levels  is  needed  equitably  across  the  country.
In Texas, for example, over 300 department employees have been trained in the past
18  months  on  research  project  specific  best  practices  and  implementations.  Topic
areas include Wireline Communication Design, PASSER V Signal Optimization, Dy-

namic  Message  Signs,  Managed  Lanes,  Measuring  Access  to  Public  Transportation,
Procedures for Setting Curve Advisory Speeds and Spall Repair.

Recently,  the  research  project  on  Transversely  Varying  Asphalt  Rates  has  been
added  as  a  course  that  will  be  available  to  the  department  employees  in  March
2009.  We  have  also  partnered  with  the  National  Highway  Institute  and  the  Trans-
portation Curriculum Coordinating Committee (TCCC) to place all new TCCC Web-
based training on the department’s Learning Content Management System. This al-
lows immediate access to these new courses in a secure environment for department
employees.  We  are  involved  with  the  Texas  Pavement  Preservation  Center,  a  col-
laborative association with the department, Center for Transportation Research, the
Texas  Transportation  Institute  and  private  industry,  and  have  developed  a  series
of training courses that are delivered on an established schedule to department em-
ployees  and  private  industry.  Over  400  employees  have  been  trained  on  best  prac-
tices in asphalt preservation methodology and design in the past 15 months.

The department is a firm believer in the use of technology not only in application
in the design, build and maintenance of roadways, but also in the delivery of train-
ing and access of the latest cutting-edge technologies for its employees. The depart-
ment  has  an  extensive  video  teleconferencing  system  that  has  been  in  place  since
2002. In FY08 alone, TxDOT used over 8,700 hours of connectivity to delivery train-
ing.  TxDOT’s  Learning  Content  Management  System  now  hosts  over  400  course  ti-
tles and is used by every employee for a variety of courses and access to resources.
The  Local  Technical  Assistance  Program  (LTAP)  is  also  a  valuable  program  for  as-
sisting  cities  and  counties  with  technical  issues  and  training.  Some  of  the  specifics
of the LTAP in Texas include:

local government officials upon request.

• Distributing  technology  transfer  materials  (videos,  CDs  and  publications)  to
• Providing  technical  information,  advice  and  guidance  upon  request  of  local
• Conducting or arranging seminars or training courses including Bridge Main-
tenance,  Road  Maintenance,  Culverts  and  Drainage,  Vegetation  Control/Her-
bicide Use and Using a Motorgrader to Shape Gravel Roads.

agencies.

Stakeholder Involvement

Lastly,  we  believe  the  current  level  of  stakeholder  involvement  in  determining
DOT  RD&T  priorities  at  the  federal  level  is  sufficient  but  needs  improvement.  The
stakeholders  included  at  the  federal  level,  for  example,  are  FHWA,  RITA,  TRB,
State DOTs, local agencies, highway industry and highway users. But sheer volume
does not necessarily mean that the programs and priorities are well coordinated and
focused. As a result, we have unnecessary duplication, significant research gaps and
increased difficulty in sharing results that can be used across the country. The chal-
lenge is big. All 50 states are conducting their own research. In addition, RITA, TRB
and  the  FHWA  have  numerous  research  programs  (for  example,  NCHRP,  SHRP  2,
and STEP). Some possibilities for improvement include:

• Defining  the  roles  and  ‘‘boundaries’’  of  the  various  programs  more  clearly.  It
should  be  much  clearer  at  the  federal  level  how  the  ‘‘pieces  of  the  puzzle’’  fit
together. For example, how does the research conducted by RITA relate to the
research conducted by FHWA? Is there duplication? Are there gaps? How and
where does one see how this ‘‘puzzle’’ fits together?
• The  goals  and  focus  areas  of  the  multitude  of  research  programs  at  the  fed-
eral  level  should  be  clearly  and  succinctly  outlined,  put  in  the  same  format
for easy comparison and kept current in one electronic document. In essence,
‘‘What is everyone doing and where do I find it?’’
• Focus  the  coordination  efforts  so  that  the  right  stakeholders  are  involved  in
the  right  programs.  More  importantly,  ensure  that  the  ‘‘products’’  resulting
from these stakeholder meetings and interactions are specific, meaningful and
measurable.  Too  often,  many  groups  at  all  levels  meet  to  develop  research
agendas.  The  problem  occurs  when  there  is  no  accountability  and  no  follow-
up.

The National Vision and Transportation Research

As Congress looks to reauthorize the Nation’s surface transportation program and
the  research  that  underpins  it,  some  simple  but  important  changes  would  not  only
re-energize that research but would cost little or nothing to do.

As we look forward to the 2009 authorization cycle, Congress should define a na-
tional strategy and provide the policy framework that empowers states and regions

to set goals, make decisions and deliver projects that implement the national strat-
egy. Not since President Eisenhower have we had a national plan for infrastructure,
and if I had to guess, Congress is starting to we think should have one, too.

Our  national  plan  should  not  only  be  for  highways.  It  must  include  all  modes  of
transportation:  mass  transit,  high-speed  rail,  freight  rail,  aviation  and  ports.  Con-
gress  should  enact  consumer-focused  legislation  and  recognize  that  Americans  ex-
pect  congestion  relief,  cleaner  air,  improved  economic  opportunity,  well  maintained
roads and increased safety.

And we’re going to have to measure how well we have succeeded, or occasionally,
how spectacularly we have failed. In the stimulus legislation that’s presently under
consideration,  a  good  portion  of  the  discussion  is  on  measuring  results.  Right  now
it  tends  to  be  about  the  number  of  jobs  created,  which  is  good,  but  we’re  going  to
need to move into measuring real congestion relief, lasting clean air impacts, safety
improvements and sustainable maintenance programs. That way we can know if we
get what we expected to get out of our transportation investments, a level of think-
ing that is absent these days.

The national research program to some degree mimics the transportation plan we
have  today.  There’s  little  central  coordination  or  vision,  everyone’s  off  doing  their
own  thing  with  inadequate  funding  and  we  generally  do  nothing  more  than  follow
processes.  When  we  spend  a  federal  dollar,  the  question  we’re  asked  isn’t  ‘‘Did  you
relieve congestion?’’ but rather ‘‘Did you follow all of the processes?’’ If we happened
to actually accomplish something, then we got lucky.

If Congress is serious about making us perform (and I hope it is), then a well or-
ganized national research program can get us there. It can define what we measure
and  how  to  best  measure  it.  I  think  it  could  also  develop  the  software  to  do  it  so
we we’re not all developing systems independent of each other at a tremendous cost
or buying it from different vendors at an equally high cost.

A  nationally  coordinated  approach  worked  for  mapping  the  human  genome
project,  and  it  can  work  for  mapping  the  next  advances  in  our  transportation  sys-
tem.

BIOGRAPHY FOR AMADEO SAENZ, JR.

Amadeo Saenz Jr., P.E., is Executive Director of the Texas Department of Trans-
portation (TxDOT). Under Texas Transportation Commission direction, he manages,
directs,  and  implements  TxDOT  policies,  programs,  and  operating  strategies.  He
represents  TxDOT  before  the  Texas  Legislature,  the  United  States  Congress  and
other entities. He was appointed as Executive Director of TxDOT in 2007. Mr. Saenz
is a trailblazer in transportation and was the first Hispanic to hold this position in
the agency’s 90-year history.

After  earning  a  Bachelor  of  Science  degree  in  civil  engineering  (with  honors)  at
the  University  of  Texas  at  Austin,  Mr.  Saenz  joined  TxDOT  in  1978  in  the  Pharr
District as an engineering laboratory assistant. As a TxDOT employee he succeeded
through various positions to learn the agency and transportation from beginning to
end.

He  was  named  district  engineer  in  the  Pharr  District  in  1993  and  held  this  posi-
tion  until  2001  when  he  was  appointed  as  Assistant  Executive  Director  for  Engi-
neering  Operations  in  Austin.  In  this  role,  he  implemented  and  managed  TxDOT’s
engineering operations policies, programs and operating strategies according to fed-
eral  and  State  laws  and  Texas  Transportation  Commission  regulations  and  direc-
tives.

A  native  of  Hebbronville,  Texas,  Saenz  is  a  past  member  of  the  Rotary  Club  and
was active with the Boy Scouts. He served on the Civil Engineering External Advi-
sory Committee for the University of Texas at Austin. He owns and operates a small
cattle  ranch  in  South  Texas,  where  he  enjoys  horseback  riding  and  hunting.  Mr.

Mr.  SKINNER.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chair  and  Members  of  the

tional  Academies.  My  testimony  this  morning  is  based  upon  the
work of expert committees appointed by the National Academies to
carry  out  projects  for  the  Federal  Highway  Administration’s
(FHWA)  Research  and  Technology  Programs  and  for  the  Research
and  Innovative  Technology  Administration  (RITA).  I  emphasize
highway  research  programs  in  my  testimony,  but  most  of  the  les-
sons  drawn  are  applicable  and  transferable  to  research  in  other
modes.

The  administration  of  our  highway  system  is  incredibly  decen-
tralized  with  tens  of  thousands  of  states  and  local  governments
owning pieces of the system. Even though the Federal Government
owns  and  operates  relatively  few  highways,  it  plays  a  crucial  role
in  research  and  the  innovation  process.  The  Federal  Government
funds  about  two-thirds  of  the  total  Highway  Research  and  Tech-
nology  Program,  enables  training  and  technology  transfer  activi-
ties,  and  is  the  sole  source  of  funding  for  higher-risk,  potentially
higher-payoff research.

Now let me turn to the questions provided in advance and high-
light  some  of  the  points  that  are  made  in  my  written  testimony.
The first question referred to R&D priorities, alignment with stake-
holders, and changing priorities. The TRB committee that reviewed
RITA’s  first  five-year  DOT-wide  strategic  plan  identified  several
constraints on having a truly strategic plan.

The  research  title  of  SAFETEA–LU  (Safe,  Accountable,  Flexible,
Efficient  Transportation  Equity  Act:  A  Legacy  for  Users)  contains
numerous, narrowly-defined designations, and many R&D activities
are earmarked to specific recipients. As a practical matter, most of
the  needed  research  identified  by  stakeholders  is  mode-specific  in
character.  Finally,  the  ability  for  USDOT  to  direct  or  control  re-
search  programs  from  a  top-down  perspective  is  in  a  natural  ten-
sion with efforts of the modal administrations to be responsive with
stakeholders.

Given the decentralized administration of the system, responsive-
ness  to  stakeholder  needs  and  perspectives  is  crucial.  FHWA  may
have  the  most  extensive  interactions  with  stakeholders  of  the
modal administrations but even it could be doing more.

Regarding  changing  priorities,  the  research  proposals  for  reau-
thorization  that  the  TRB  Executive  Committee  looked  at  last
spring  did  not  adequately  recognize  the  growing  importance  of  re-
ducing  transportation  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  energy  con-
sumption.  TRB  now  has  a  study  underway  that  will  make  rec-
ommendations before SAFETEA–LU expires regarding research on
climate change mitigation and adaptation.

The  second  question  concerns  improvements  to  transportation
R&D  investment  structure.  In  concept,  the  portfolio  of  programs
funded  through  SAFETEA–LU  is  appropriate,  but  the  program,  as
authorized,  is  far  more  detailed  than  necessary.  Compare  that  to
NSF (National Science Foundation), which has a budget that is 10
to 15 times greater with fewer line items.

Other  weaknesses  in  the  structure  include:  too  small  a  share  of
the  funding  is  devoted  to  advanced  or  longer-term,  higher-risk  re-
search;  policy  research  is  neglected;  there  is  too  little  emphasis  on
data collection; and inadequate attention to technology transfer.

32

The  third  question,  in  fact,  addresses  improvements  to  the  tech-
nology  transfer  programs.  FHWA  provides  extensive  information
about  new  technologies  and  practices,  administers  the  Local  Tech-
nical Assistance Program (LTAP), and offers training on new tech-
nologies  and  practices.  These  activities,  however,  are  not  sufficient
to  fully  overcome  the  significant  barriers  to  innovation  that  exist.
Our  recently-released  report  on  implementing  the  results  from
the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) provides a model
of  what  is  required  to  assist  the  states  in  deploying  new  tech-
nologies  and  practices.  For  SHRP  products  the  committee  rec-
ommends  a  large-scale  implementation  effort  totaling  $400  million
over six years. It would be guided by a formal stakeholder advisory
committee and detailed, publicly-available implementation plans.

The  final  question  asked  about  lessons  learned  from  the  last  re-
authorization,  excuse  me,  the  final  question  asked  about  lessons
learned  from  the  last  reauthorization  of  Surface  Transportation
Programs.  The  principles  for  research  articulated  in  the  preamble
to Title V are good ones, and I hope they will be retained, and more
importantly,  followed.  They  encourage  stakeholder  involvement,
competitive  award  of  funding  based  upon  merit  review,  advanced
research,  and  a  federal  program  that  spans  the  entire  innovation
process.

Along  with  fewer,  more-broadly  defined  line  items,  adherence  to
these principles would restore funding to policy and other core mis-
sions,  including  enhanced  technology  transfer,  and  provide  flexi-
bility  needed  to  respond  to  changing  needs.  Specific  recommenda-
tions  based  on  our  assessment  of  SAFETEA–LU’s  Title  V  are  in-
cluded in my written testimony.

Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Committee.

I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT E. SKINNER, JR.

INTRODUCTION

Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. My name is Robert
E.  Skinner,  Jr.  I  am  the  Executive  Director  of  the  Transportation  Research  Board
(TRB)  of  the  National  Academies.  TRB  is  one  of  the  five  divisions  of  the  National
Research Council (NRC), which, in turn, is the operating arm of the National Acad-
emy  of  Sciences,  National  Academy  of  Engineering,  and  the  Institute  of  Medicine.
This  complex  of  organizations  is  collectively  referred  to  as  the  National  Academies.
The  institution  operates  under  the  charter  given  to  the  National  Academy  of
Sciences  by  Congress  in  1863  to  advise  the  government  on  matters  of  science  and
technology.

From  the  1920s  until  1975,  my  organization  was  named  the  Highway  Research
Board.  In  1975  the  organization  became  multi-modal  and  was  renamed  the  Trans-
portation  Research  Board.  TRB’s  mission  is  to  promote  innovation  and  progress  in
transportation  through  research.  It  is  best  known  for  its  role  in  promoting  innova-
tion and information exchange by maintaining approximately 200 standing technical
committees  in  all  modes  of  transportation  and  hosting  an  Annual  Meeting  that  at-
tracts more than 10,000 participants from the United States and around the world.
TRB  also  conducts  policy  studies  for  Congress  and  the  executive  branch,  and  is  in-
creasingly  called  upon  to  administer  research  programs  for  others  that  are  stake-
holder-directed  and  primarily  award  research  funding  based  on  competition  and
merit review by peers.

The testimony I will give today is based upon the work of expert committees, ap-
pointed by the NRC, and serving without compensation to carry out projects for the
Federal  Highway  Administration’s  (FHWA)  research  and  technology  programs  and
the  Research  and  Innovative  Technology  Administration  (RITA).  I  have  cited  these

different  reports  throughout  my  testimony,  and  they  are  listed  at  the  end  of  this
document.

We also have committees at work reviewing the research programs of the Federal
Railroad  and  Federal  Transit  Administrations,  and  TRB  manages  cooperative  re-
search programs for transit agencies and airports. I have not addressed these modes
in my written testimony in any detail but will be happy to comment on these activi-
ties if requested. I emphasize highway research programs in my testimony, but most
of the lessons drawn are applicable and transferable to research in other modes.

Importance of Highways

The American lifestyle is absolutely dependent on highway transportation. Ameri-
cans  use  personal  vehicles  for  87  percent  of  daily  trips  and  90  percent  of  long  dis-
tance trips. The decentralized U.S. economy would be unimaginable without the ac-
cess  that  highways  provide  for  motor  carriers.  Truck  ton-miles  represent  about  30
percent  of  total  ton-miles  of  freight;  more  importantly  that  tonnage  accounts  for
nearly 75 percent of the value of freight shipped domestically.

With  the  fourth  largest  land  area  of  any  country,  the  United  States  is  surely  the
most  reliant  upon  roads  and  highways.  The  Nation  has  8.4  million  lane  miles  (3.2
million  miles)  of  roads  connecting  metropolitan  areas,  towns,  and  counties  across
the  country  to  serve  its  300  million  residents  and  seven  million  business  establish-
ments.

As  valuable  and  important  as  highway  transportation  is,  it  also  faces  enormous
challenges.  For  example,  demand  on  the  system  increased  sharply  in  recent  years
resulting  in  the  congestion  we  have  become  all  too  familiar  with.  Total  highway
travel  in  personal  vehicles,  motorcycles,  light  and  heavy  trucks  totals  nearly  three
trillion  miles  annually.  Total  travel  has  leveled  off  in  the  last  couple  of  years,  but
it  increased  25  percent  between  1997  and  2006.  Not  only  is  much  of  the  highway
system  reaching  or  exceeding  its  expected  service  life,  it  is  also  carrying  a  much
heavier burden than expected. The amount of traffic on rural Interstates more than
doubled  between  1970  and  2005,  but  the  loadings  placed  on  those  highways,  due
largely  to  more  trucks  traveling  more  miles,  increased  six-fold  during  that  period.
The  system  is  facing  unprecedented  challenges  in  overall  demand,  safety,  the  cost
of  paying  for  system  preservation  and  operation,  and  environmental  impact.  Be-
cause there is not enough money to meet all these challenges, research and innova-
tion is desperately needed. For example, we must learn how to reconstruct highways
more  efficiently  at  lower  cost  and  do  so  while  continuing  to  maintain  service  with
minimal  disruptions.  We  must  also  strive  to  meet  ever-higher  standards  for  pro-
viding capacity with minimal disruption to communities and the environment.

AN  OVERVIEW  OF  U.S.  HIGHWAY  RESEARCH  &  TECHNOLOGY  PRO-

GRAMS

Decentralized Responsibilities

Highway  research,  like  the  management  of  the  highway  system  itself,  is  highly
decentralized,  and  appropriately  so.  Roads  and  highways  are  owned  and  operated
by the states, thousands of counties, and tens of thousands of cities and municipali-
ties. These many and varied organizations make all the key decisions about invest-
ment,  operation,  and  preservation  of  roads.  Aside  from  the  roads  on  federal  lands,
the Federal Government has little direct connection with the pressures of financing,
building,  maintaining,  and  operating  roads.  Doing  so  is  a  massive  enterprise.
Roughly $94 billion is spent every year on roads and highways.

Each  state  has  its  own  highway  research  program,  and  states,  in  turn  are  pro-
viders  of  technology  and  innovation  to  cities,  counties,  and  municipalities.  States’
R&T  programs  often  provide  the  final  step  in  implementing  new  technologies,  and
they  must  meet  the  particular  needs  of  individual  states’  soil  conditions,  climate,
and  institutional  arrangements.  Pavement  design  itself,  for  example,  is  highly  de-
pendent upon local soil conditions, moisture levels, temperature ranges, and sources
of local aggregate. Operational needs range widely between states with major metro-
politan areas and states mostly made up of rural areas. State policy concerns about
economic development, finance, environmental issues, and safety also vary consider-
ably across states. State research programs support research initiatives in all these
areas.

The existence of 52 programs might suggest that duplication would occur, but, in
fact,  states  have  a  system  of  sharing  resources  in  order  to  study  topics  of  collective
interest, and the states and federal transportation agencies, through TRB, maintain
a  database  of  completed  research  and  research  in  progress,  which  states  are  re-
quired  by  FHWA  to  consult  before  initiating  new  projects.  State  highway  research
programs  are  mostly  funded  through  federal  aid.  For  decades,  the  federal  aid  title

34

of surface transportation authorization (Title I) has required states to spend a small
percentage  of  federal  aid  on  planning  and  research.  (The  State  Planning  and  Re-
search  (SP&R)  program  currently  sets  aside  two  percent  of  selected  highway  pro-
gram  funding  of  which  25  percent  must  be  spent  on  research.)  States  pool  some  of
their  resources  in  the  National  Cooperative  Highway  Research  Program  (NCHRP),
which  is  managed  by  TRB  on  the  states’  behalf,  as  described  in  more  detail  below.

Federal Role

Even  though  the  Federal  Government  has  a  minor  role  in  owning  and  operating
highways,  it  plays  a  virtually  indispensable  role  in  the  research  and  innovation
process.  The  Federal  Government  funds  about  two-thirds  of  total  highway  research
and  technology  programs  (Table  1),  plays  a  critical  role  in  training  and  technology
transfer, and is the sole source of funding for higher-risk, potentially higher-pay off
research.

The  Federal  Highway  Administration  (FHWA)  is  the  principal  agency  managing
highway  research  at  USDOT.  It  has  research  activities  in  each  of  its  mission-area
responsibilities:  infrastructure,  operations,  environment  and  planning,  safety,  and
policy. Through its research and program office staff in these areas, FHWA interacts
with  experts  and  stakeholders  in  the  public  and  private  sectors  to  develop  multi-
year program plans for their research and development activities.

The Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) research program, initiated and for-
merly  managed  by  FHWA,  is  now  managed  by  the  Research  and  Innovative  Tech-
nology  Administration  (RITA).  The  ITS  program  is  multi-modal,  but  most  of  the
projects  and  funding  are  highway-related.  In  addition,  the  University  Transpor-
tation  Centers  (UTCs)  conduct  highway  research  (generally  with  federal  funding);
this  program  is  administered  by  RITA.  The  UTC  program  is  multi-modal,  but  69
percent  of  the  projects  in  2008  were  focused  on  highway  topics,1 hence  I  have  in-
cluded it as part of the federal investment in highway research. Various private en-
tities  fund  highway  research,  but  their  role  is  surprisingly  small.2 Because  of  the
large  public  presence  in  roads  and  highways  and  the  nature  of  public  procurement
of highway goods and services, there are relatively few opportunities for the private
sector  to  capitalize  on  private  research.  Consequently,  the  share  of  private  funding
is small and the public responsibilities for encouraging innovation are large.

FHWA  is  closely  connected  to  the  states  though  its  federal  aid  and  RD&T  pro-
grams and has offices in each state. RITA, in addition to administering the ITS and
UTC programs, has a role in strategic RD&T planning for the department. Because
of the extent of earmarked research and detailed designations of research programs
in  the  Safe,  Accountable,  Flexible,  Efficient,  Transportation  Equity  Act  of  2005
(SAFETEA–LU),  about  which  I  will  say  more  later,  RITA  has  had  limited  oppor-
tunity to influence the scope and direction of highway research.4

A  federal  role  of  growing  importance  is  the  support  for  higher-risk,  potentially
higher pay-off research. TRB has been administering an NRC-appointed expert com-
mittee  to  provide  guidance  to  the  FHWA  RD&T  program  since  1992.  The  Research
and  Technology  Coordinating  Committee  (RTCC)  has  consistently  encouraged
FHWA to invest in this kind of research.5 The vast majority of the highway research
conducted  in  this  country  is  highly  applied,  problem-solving  research,  as  it  should
be.  But  no  agency  has  been  funding  more  exploratory  research  that  is  seeking  new
understanding that could lead to new breakthroughs. The Exploratory Advanced Re-
search program authorized in SAFETEA–LU is an example of this kind of research
and  a  welcome  change.  In  principle,  this  kind  of  research  should  also  be  supported
through  UTC  program,  but  the  dollar-for-dollar  matching  requirement  of  the  UTC
program has driven this program to focus on applied research.

Special Initiatives

Over  the  years  stakeholders  in  the  highway  community  have  requested  special
initiatives  to  meet  special  needs.  Most  of  these  initiatives  have  been  governed  by
stakeholders and funded with federal aid and rely on competition and merit review
to award contracts and grants.

AASHO Road Test and Long Term Pavement Performance Experiment.

In the late 1950s an extensive series of tests was conducted for the American As-
sociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), then named the
American  Association  of  State  Highway  Officials  (AASHO),  on  a  pavement  test
track.  These  tests  established  the  empirical  relationships  between  pavement  load-

ings and distress that that became the basis of the first AASHTO pavement design
guide  issued  in  1961,  which  subsequently  determined  pavement  designs  in  the
United  States  as  well  as  influencing  them  around  the  world.  TRB,  then  the  High-
way Research Board, administered these tests for AASHO.

The  AASHO  road  test,  however,  did  not  adequately  account  for  variations  in  soil
conditions,  materials,  climate,  and  other  factors  that  influence  pavement  deteriora-
tion  in  addition  to  loadings.  The  Long-Term  Pavement  Performance  (LTPP)  experi-
ment, begun 20 years ago, and costing over $260 million in federal funding, will be
nearly  completed  this  year.  FHWA  has  managed  the  experiment  in  collaboration
with the states, which have invested at least double the federal share in constructed
pavements  and  data  collection.  An  NRC-appointed  committee  administered  by  TRB
has  advised  FHWA  and  the  states  on  the  conduct  of  this  experiment.  The  data  col-
lected  to  date  have  already  been  influential  in  implementing  the  new  Mechanistic-
Empirical Design Guide being implemented by the states and will likely be as influ-
ential in future pavement design as the AASHO road test.

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) program

In the late 1980s a broad-based public-private stakeholder group known as Mobil-
ity  2000  began  promoting  the  need  to  apply  computer  and  electronic  communica-
tions technologies to increase the capacity and safety of highways. The research and
demonstration  program  that  was  initially  funded  in  the  Intermodal  Surface  Trans-
portation  Efficiency  Act  of  1991,  has  since  invested  more  than  $1.2  billion  in  devel-
oping,  testing,  and  implementing  ITS  technologies.  ITS  America,  an  outgrowth  of
Mobility  2000,  was  originally  designated  as  the  formal  advisory  body  for  the  pro-
gram; RITA now has a designated ITS advisory committee for this purpose.

Strategic Highway Research Programs (SHRP) 1 and 2.

Originally  conceived  by  an  NRC-appointed  committee  administered  by  TRB,  the
first  SHRP  program  was  a  fixed-duration  $150  million  research  effort  focused  on
materials and maintenance practices that produced significant breakthroughs in as-
phalt  mix  design  procedures  and  winter  maintenance  practices.  FHWA,  AASHTO,
and  TRB  collaborated  in  the  development  of  detailed  research  plans.  The  program
was authorized in the 1987 surface transportation reauthorization legislation. A spe-
cial  unit  of  the  NRC  was  created  to  allow  for  stakeholders  governance  of  the  pro-
gram  and  convene  expert  panels  to  produce  requests  for  proposals  (RFPs),  provide
merit  review  of  the  proposals,  recommend  selection  of  contractors,  and  manage  the
contractors.

In  the  Transportation  Equity  Act  for  the  21st  Century,  Congress  requested  that
TRB convene another NRC-appointed committee to determine the need for a second
SHRP. A committee made up of leaders from the highway community recommended
an  ambitious  program  to  significantly  improve  safety,  provide  capacity  in  greater
harmony  with  community  values  and  the  environment,  improve  travel  time  reli-
ability,  and  renew  highway  capacity  more  efficiently  and  effectively  while  under
traffic.6 SAFETEA–LU authorized a six-year, $205 million program for this purpose.
Under  a  three-way  partnership  with  AASHTO,  FHWA,  and  TRB,  the  program  is
governed  by  stakeholders  and  administered  by  TRB.  Eighty-five  percent  of  the  re-
search funds are awarded competitively based on merit review by peers.

National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP)

Since  1962,  under  a  cooperative  agreement  among  AASHTO,  FHWA  and  TRB,
TRB has administered the NCHRP program. In this cooperative program, the states
select  the  topics  to  be  studied  through  the  Standing  Committee  on  Research  of
AASHTO. TRB then forms panels of experts to issue RFPs, review proposals, select
contractors, and oversee the research. TRB administers similar programs for transit
agencies  (Transit  Cooperative  Research  Program,  since  1991),  and  airports  (Airport
Cooperative Research Program, since 2005).

Other Cooperative Research Programs

SAFETEA–LU  authorized  two  relatively  small-scale  cooperative  programs  that
TRB  administers  for  others.  One  program,  recommended  by  AASHTO,  addresses
intermodal  freight  research  issues.  Another  pilot  program,  recommended  by  an
NRC-appointed committee convened at the request of USDOT, addresses hazardous

materials transportation.7 As with other cooperative programs, stakeholders provide
the governance and TRB provides the administration.

In 2002, an NRC-appointed committee also recommended the creation of a Surface
Transportation Environment and Planning cooperative research program.8 The com-
mittee  that  authored  that  report  was  chaired  by  Betty  Deakin,  who  is  also  invited
to  testify  today.  A  key  concept  behind  this  proposal  was  to  bring  the  highway  and
environmental  communities  together  to  govern  a  research  program  that  would  use
the  best  science  and  technology  to  address  and  resolve  some  of  the  contentious
issues and questions that separate these two constituencies. SAFETEA–LU author-
ized  such  a  program  and  left  it  to  the  discretion  of  USDOT  whether  to  manage  it
directly  or  have  TRB  form  a  stakeholder  committee  to  provide  governance  of  the
program.  Partly  due  to  the  funding  constraints  SAFETEA–LU  imposed  on  USDOT,
FHWA chose to retain the program, which, nonetheless, does have an extensive out-
reach component.

The  structure  of  the  highway  research  program  appears  complicated,  and  it  is.
The  genius  of  the  design,  however,  is  that  the  programs  and  initiatives  are  struc-
tured  for  the  most  part  so  that  they  are  close  to  the  various  problems  they  are  de-
signed to address. In principle, the various programs provide a portfolio that ranges
from highly applied to more exploratory research. In the view of many, the balance
is  not  quite  right,  and,  for  the  amount  of  money  being  spent,  there  appear  to  be
far too many categories and far too little flexibility to shift program priorities in re-
sponse  to  new  opportunities,  such  as  nanotechnology,  or  emerging  needs,  such  as
security and climate change.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM RECENT NRC REPORTS

Two NRC-appointed committees have recently completed reports that address the
questions  posed  by  the  committee.  After  summarizing  the  main  findings  and  rec-
ommendations  of  these  reports,  I  respond  to  the  Committee’s  questions  more  di-
rectly.

Last  November  the  NRC  released  the  RTCC  report  entitled  The  Federal  Invest-
ment in Highway Research 2006–2009: Strengths and Weaknesses. This report evalu-
ates  the  federal  highway  RD&T  programs  in  terms  of  the  principles  for  research
that  are  articulated  by  Congress  in  the  introduction  to  Title  V  of  SAFETEA–LU.
Some  of  these  principles  are  based  on  recommendations  made  by  the  RTCC  in  is
2001 report, The Federal Role in Highway Research. These principles address:

• the scope of the federal RD&T program;
• when federal investment is justified,
• the  content  of  the  program,  including  fundamental,  long-term  research;  gap-

filling research; and policy or planning research;

• stakeholder input;
• awarding  R&D  funds  primarily  through  competition  and  peer,  or  merit,  re-

view; and

• evaluation of research.

The main findings of the RTCC are as follows:

• Despite  the  progress  made  in  overall  funding  in  SAFETEA–LU,  highway  re-
search  programs  are  significantly  under  funded  compared  with  the  level  of
R&D  investment  in  private  industry.  Public  and  private  highway  research  is
funded at only 25 percent of the level of industrial R&D in the United States
(0.9  percent  of  highway  expenditures  compared  to  3.4  percent  of  industrial
sales).

• The  research  programs  funded  in  SAFETEA–LU  meet  the  Title  V  principles

with these main exceptions:

Æ Extensive  earmarking  (62  percent)  of  the  University  Transportation
(UTC)  Program  and  additional  earmarks  scattered  across  FHWA  pro-
grams  (equal  to  at  least  18  percent  of  total  funding)  violate  the
SAFETEA–LU principle of awarding research funds according to competi-
tion and merit review.

38

Æ The  programs  funded  in  SAFETEA–LU  do  not  include  all  the  content
areas  Congress  requested.  Due  to  funding  constraints  in  Title  V  caused
by  a  considerable  number  of  narrowly-designated  programs  and  ear-
marking  of  more  programs  than  were  authorized,  FHWA  was  forced  to
cut important areas of research in safety, operations, planning and envi-
ronment, and policy. Funding for research and data gathering to support
policy decisions was eliminated and funding for planning was greatly re-
duced.  Other  areas  that  are  funded,  such  as  deployment  and  technology
transfer, are nonetheless inadequate to the task.9

Æ The  50–50  matching  requirement  for  the  UTC  program  biases  this  pro-
gram  toward  highly  applied  research  and  away  from  advanced  research
that  is  one  of  the  main  rationales  for  having  a  university  research  pro-
gram.

Æ Due  to  funding  constraints,  FHWA  has  inadequate  funds  to  carry
through  on  commitments  it  has  made  in  its  Corporate  Master  Plan  for
Research,  Deployment  and  Innovation  to  engage  stake  holders  more
broadly in agenda setting, merit review, and program evaluation.

Æ The  SHRP  2  program  meets  all  the  research  principles,  but  is  funded  at
only  one-third  the  level  and  for  two  years  less  than  stakeholders  re-
quested.  The  down-scaled  program  will  not  be  able  to  meet  all  the  origi-
nal goals envisioned.

The committee also makes several important recommendations.

1. To  the  maximum  extent  practical,  research  funding  should  be  awarded

through competition and merit review.

2. All  UTC  funds  should  be  awarded  to  universities  competitively.  The  50–50
matching  requirement  for  UTC  research  should  be  reduced  to  a  20  percent
university match to allow universities to conduct more advanced research.

3. The Exploratory Advanced Research program should be continued.
4. The State Planning and Research (SP&R) program should be continued.
5. Cuts  in  policy,  safety,  operations,  and  planning  and  environmental  research
at FHWA should be restored. Funding for research and data gathering to in-
form  policy  decisions  should  be  increased  to  meet  pressing  national  needs.
The  surface  transportation  environmental  and  planning  research  program
should  be  authorized  as  a  cooperative  research  program  in  which  the  stake-
holders  are  enabled  to  govern  the  program.  In  the  planning  area,  additional
funding  for  expanded  data  collection  and  improving  regional  travel  fore-
casting models should be provided.

6. Congress  should  consider  extending  the  SHRP  2  program  for  two  years  into
the next authorization and funded under Title I. (Under Title I, the funding
would come from states’ construction budgets, which they have approved.)

7. Other  research  programs  strongly  supported  by  stakeholders  responsible  for
administering highways, such as the Long-Term Pavement Performance Pro-
gram10 and  the  Long-Term  Bridge  Performance  Program  should  be  contin-
ued.

8. Adequate  resources  should  be  provided  to  FHWA  for  a  robust  program  for
deployment of research results to states, local governments, and private ven-
dors.

9. Resources should be provided to FHWA to institute a process of ongoing pri-
ority  setting  for  highway  research  that  engages  the  entire  highway  commu-
nity. The results of these efforts would inform all highway research programs
and improve the ability of all programs to focus efforts on the highest prior-
ities.

A  second  NRC  committee  has  recently  recommended  a  deployment  program  that
would implement the results of the SHRP 2 program in its report, Implementing the

9 SAFETEA–LU technical corrections legislation of 2008 restored some of FHWA’s lost funding

and gave the agency discretion over about an additional $14 million annually.

10 The recently issued NRC report, Preserving and Maximizing the Utility of the Pavement Per-
formance  Database,  Transportation  Research  Board  of  the  National  Academies,  February  2009,
recommends  completing  the  data  collection  from  the  500  or  so  highway  sections  of  the  LTPP
experiment  that  will  still  be  providing  important  information  at  the  end  of  2009  and  estab-
lishing a permanent database to allow researchers to mine these data and complete the analysis
originally  envisioned  for  this  experiment,  which  has  not  been  conducted  due  to  funding  con-
straints.

Results of the Second Strategic Highway Research Program: Saving Lives, Reducing
Congestion, Improving Quality of Life.

The committee recommends that a large-scale deployment effort totaling $400 mil-
lion  over  six  years  be  carried  out  by  FHWA  in  partnership  with  AASHTO,  the  Na-
tional  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA),  and  TRB.  The  committee
also recommends that:

• this  implementation  effort  be  guided  by  advice  from  a  formal  advisory  com-
mittee  made  up  of  key  stakeholders  who  must  implement  the  results  from
SHRP 2 and

• detailed,  publicly-available  implementation  plans  be  developed  with  stake-

holder input.

I include these recommendations of this report because the large-scale, organized
deployment  program  envisioned  provides  a  model  for  how  FHWA  should  be  orga-
nizing itself to support the delivery of innovation. The RTCC report calls for funding
a  ‘‘robust’’  program  of  deployment  and  this  is  certainly  an  example  of  a  robust  pro-
gram. It has to be. Innovation in the highway sector is challenging. The largely pub-
lic-sector  highway  field  results  in  an  extremely  risk-averse  environment.  The  bar-
riers  to  innovation  are  high.  The  procurement  of  highway  goods  and  services  is
highly detailed and specified as public procurements often must be. There are severe
penalties for failures and few rewards for success. The key concepts of this commit-
tee’s proposal are its guidance by stakeholders, its degree of organization and dedi-
cation, and the scale of funding necessary to deliver results to overcome the barriers
to innovation.

RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS POSED BY THE COMMITTEE
1. How are R&D priorities developed and coordinated within DOT and how are they
aligned  with  the  needs  of  the  user  community?  What  is  your  assessment  of  these
priorities?  Do  we  need  to  change  any  R&D  priorities  to  address  major  challenges
such as environmental impact and energy consumption?

R&D Priorities

SAFETEA–LU  charged  RITA  with  preparing  a  multi-modal  strategic  five-year
RD&T plan and required that the plan be reviewed by the National Research Coun-
cil.  The  five-year  plan  was  released  in  2006.11 An  NRC  committee  reviewed  this
plan  and  found  that  it  was  best  described  as  a  summary  of  what  research  the  var-
ious modal administrations were funding rather than a true strategic plan.12 There
are  important  reasons  why  this  plan  was  not  truly  strategic  from  a  top-down  per-
spective.  First,  the  research  titles  of  SAFETEA–LU  contain  numerous  narrowly-de-
fined  designations  and  many  R&D  activities  are  earmarked  to  specific  recipients.
These  designations  and  earmarks  exceed  the  amount  authorized,  which  effectively
removes agency discretion in shifting resources to respond to USDOT priorities. Sec-
ond,  as  a  practical  matter,  most  of  the  needed  research  identified  by  stakeholders
is truly modal in character. Pavements and structures, for example, are such a large
share  of  highway  agency  responsibilities  and  expenditures  that  it  is  natural  that
FHWA  would  conduct  extensive  research  in  these  areas  with  an  interest  and  focus
not  shared  by  other  modal  administrations.  Safety  is  another  important  area  for
FHWA,  and  its  areas  of  highway  safety  responsibility  are  well  delineated  and  dis-
tinct  from  those  of  NHTSA  and  the  Federal  Motor  Carrier  Safety  Administration.
Finally, the ability of USDOT to direct or control the research programs from a top-
down  perspective  is  in  a  natural  tension  with  the  efforts  of  the  modal  administra-
tions  to  be  responsive  to  the  ‘‘bottoms  up’’  needs  for  research  identified  by  stake-
holders. It is appropriate for USDOT to set broad goals and objectives for the RD&T
program, allocate resources according to direction set by Congress, support advanced
research, and conduct mission-critical research for federal regulation and oversight.
FHWA  should  be  taking  more  of  a  leadership  role  in  developing  research  priorities
in  concert  with  the  entire  highway  community.  Because  USDOT  is  so  disconnected
from  responsibilities  of  actually  delivering  and  operating  infrastructure,  however,
the federal RD&T program should be largely driven by stakeholders.

Alignment with needs of user community

The research programs of the modal administrations reach out to stakeholders to
inform  their  selection  of  research  priorities  and  projects.  As  mentioned  previously,
TRB  has  expert  committees  reviewing  the  research  programs  of  FHWA,  FTA,  and
FRA as well as committees of experts reviewing the FHWA’s pavement research and
deployment activities and the conduct of the Long-Term Pavement Performance ex-
periment.  TRB  also  manages  the  SHRP  2  research  program,  which  was  identified
and  is  governed  by  stakeholders.  The  FAA  has  an  extensive  advisory  committee
structure for its aviation research program.

The FHWA probably has the most extensive interactions with stakeholders, as de-
scribed in some detail in Chapter 5 of The Federal Investment in Highway Research
2006–2009: Strengths and Weaknesses. FHWA’s different R&D offices for infrastruc-
ture, operations, safety, and planning and environment have varied outreach efforts
to  different  constituencies,  including  AASHTO  committees,  Metropolitan  Planning
Organizations (MPOs), industry associations, public-private consortia, standing com-
mittees  of  TRB’s  Technical  Activities  Division,  environmental  and  safety  groups,
and  others.  The  program  and  research  offices  have  developed  multi-year  R&D  pro-
gram  drawing  on  stakeholder  input.  Moreover,  FHWA  has  committed  to  working
even more extensively with stakeholders in its Corporate Master Plan for Research,
Deployment  and  Innovation,  although  the  RTCC  notes  in  its  2008  report  that  be-
cause  of  the  constraints  in  Title  V,  FHWA  has  not  had  the  discretionary  resources
to  carry  out  the  commitments  it  made.  Despite  FHWA’s  extensive  and  varied  out-
reach to stakeholders, however, it is fair to say that FHWA could do more to make
these  activities  more  transparent  to  others.  Many  of  the  interactions  between  re-
search  and  program  offices  and  various  stakeholder  groups  are  carried  out  infor-
mally.  FHWA  should  be  communicating  via  its  website  the  opportunities  for  stake-
holders  to  participate  in  the  shaping  of  its  program,  documenting  the  input  it  has
received,  and  posting  its  multi-year  research  program  roadmaps.  FHWA  is  clearly
listening  to  and  working  with  stakeholder  groups  and  most  of  its  R&D  programs
and  initiatives  within  these  programs  are  aligned  with  stakeholder  interests.  Be-
cause the Federal Transit Administration’s program is so heavily earmarked, it has
relatively  little  discretion  over  what  research  it  conducts,  but  its  research  office
should be reaching out to the American Public Transportation Association and other
transit  industry  stakeholders  in  the  ongoing  development  of  its  strategic  RD&T
plan.13 Much  of  the  Federal  Railroad  Administration’s  R&D  program  is  safety-ori-
ented research driven by its safety regulatory mission, but it also could be more at-
tuned to research the states and passenger and freight rail industries would benefit
from.14

Changing Priorities

The TRB Executive Committee recognized in mid 2008 that the surface transpor-
tation  research  proposals  for  reauthorization  being  developed  by  various  groups
were deficient in not recognizing the growing importance of reducing transportation
greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and  energy  consumption.  TRB  has  self-initiated
studies  under  way  that  we  anticipate  will  make  recommendations  to  Congress  be-
fore SAFETEA–LU expires regarding research in climate change mitigation and ad-
aptation  and  will  identify  policy  options  for  reducing  transportation  energy  con-
sumption and GHG emissions.

Despite  what  I  anticipate  will  be  recommendations  for  dedicated  research  in  the
areas  of  climate  change  and  energy  conservation,  I  hesitate  to  recommend  cutting
existing  programs  to  shift  funds  to  these  areas.  The  RTCC  report  notes  that  high-
way research is significantly underfunded. The share of annual revenues devoted to
highway research is only one quarter as large as industry generally and comparable
to  the  lowest  of  the  low-technology  sectors  of  industry.  But  the  challenges  faced  in
the highway sector are among the most complex and important of society. We have
a  sunk  investment  in  infrastructure  worth  well  over  a  trillion  dollars  that  has  to
be  maintained.  We  lose  more  than  40,000  people  each  year  in  traffic  crashes.  The
motor  vehicles  that  use  the  highway  system  burn  petroleum-based  fuels  almost  ex-
clusively  and  are  a  main  source  of  our  dependence  on  imported  oil.  We  must  find
a funding mechanism to replace or supplement the gasoline tax as the mainstay for
funding highway and transit programs. And highways are significant sources of neg-

ative environmental impact. Because we are also so heavily dependent on highways
to serve our economy and society, the need for innovation to address these problems
has never been greater.
2. How would we improve our transportation R&D investment structure?

R&D Investment Structure

In  concept,  the  portfolio  of  programs  funded  through  SAFETEA–LU  is  appro-
priate,  but  the  program  is  far  more  detailed  than  necessary.  In  an  ideal  world,  the
programs  would  mirror  FHWA’s  mission,  goals,  and  operational  areas  (infrastruc-
ture,  operations,  safety,  planning  and  environment,  and  policy)  with  flexibility  for
the  agency  to  be  responsive  to  new  issues  and  stakeholder  input.  FHWA’s  share  of
Title  V,  Surface  Transportation  Research  and  Technology  Deployment,  has  42  line
items  to  allocate  $130  million,  many  of  these  line  items  are  at  the  research  project
level. Compare that to NSF, which has a budget in excess of $6 billion and roughly
the same number of line items.

There  are  several  federally-managed  programs  funded  through  Title  V  that  are
clearly  aligned  with  stakeholder  interests;  the  State  programs  are  supported
through  the  State  Planning  and  Research  (SP&R)  provisions  in  Title  I;  special  ini-
tiatives such as the fixed-duration Strategic Highway Research Programs have been
funded  from  time  to  time;  and  support  for  university-initiated  research  is  provided
through the University Transportation Centers Program.

A principal weakness in the portfolio is the scant funding for advanced, or longer-
term, higher-risk research. The creation of the Exploratory Advanced Research Pro-
gram  (EARP)  in  SAFETA–LU  is  a  step  in  the  right  direction.  In  its  2001  report,
the  RTCC  recommended  that  25  percent  of  the  FHWA  program  be  devoted  to
‘‘longer-term,  higher-risk’’  research.  Applied  research  is  the  central  element  of  the
federal  program,  and  it  should  be,  but  it  is  also  incremental  in  nature.  Such  re-
search is unlikely to result in breakthroughs that can transform practice. At present
the  EAR  program  represents  about  six  percent  of  FHWA’s  overall  program.  It  is  a
good start, but far from the goal the RTCC has suggested.15

The RTCC’s 2008 report recognizes the role that the UTC program could be play-
ing in advanced research. Universities are ideally suited for creating new knowledge
and  understanding,  and  the  UTC  program  is  one  of  the  few  surface  transportation
research  programs  that  can  fund  investigator-initiated  research.  The  RTCC  finds,
however,  that  the  UTC  program  is  mostly  conducting  applied  research.  A  scan  of
highway  research  projects  under  way  in  the  UTC  program  indicates  that  at  least
80  percent  are  highly  applied.16 The  RTCC  concludes  that  the  dollar-for-dollar
matching  requirement  of  the  UTC  program  drives  it  toward  applied  research.  Most
of  the  providers  of  matching  funds  are  state  DOTs,  which  they  typically  provide
from  SP&R  funds,  and  they  tend  to  want  their  SP&R  funds  devoted  to  solving  the
many immediate problems they face. An important reform of the UTC program rec-
ommended by the RTCC is to change the matching requirement to a 20 percent uni-
versity  match.  This  would  free  up  universities  to  devote  more  of  their  available
funding to the kind of advanced research the program was created to conduct in the
first  place.  At  the  same  time,  of  course,  the  UTCs  should  be  selected  competitively,
rather than having 62 percent earmarked.

Another weakness of the structure of the program is the relative neglect of policy
research.  Many  important  transportation  policy  questions  are  going  uninvestigated
because  of  lack  of  any  funding  for  this  purpose,  forcing  infrastructure  owners  to
make  decisions  while  ill  informed.  This  is  the  kind  of  research  that  ought  be  con-
ducted to guide decisions about intermodal investments, such as inter-city passenger
rail,  improved  highway  access  to  ports,  short-sea  shipping,  and  policies  to  enhance
the  effectiveness  of  transit.  The  lack  of  policy  relevant  research  significantly  ham-
pered the work of the two commissions Congress created in SAFETEA–LU to advise
it on, among other things, the future viability of motor fuels taxes to fund highway
and  transit  infrastructure.  Gaps  in  knowledge  about  how  sensitive  travelers  are  to
rising  fuel  prices  and  increased  congestion,  or  how  freight  traffic  might  switch
modes  for  these  same  reasons,  for  example,  undermine  confidence  in  projecting  fu-
ture revenue streams for the highway trust fund, which is one of the key policy con-

15 There  are  earmarked  programs  that  are  addressing,  in  part,  advanced  research  in  asphalt.
The  RTCC,  however,  recommends  that  advanced  research  conform  to  the  principles  Congress
established  in  Title  V—that  funds  be  awarded  based  on  competition  and  merit  review  of  pro-
posals by peers.

cerns  for  reauthorization  of  the  highway  program  in  2009.  Policy  funding  was  re-
duced  to  almost  zero  as  a  result  of  the  over-designation  and  earmarking  of  funds
in  Title  V.  Funding  that  had  been  about  $9-10  million  annually  was  eliminated.
Last  year’s  technical  corrections  legislation  helped,  but  restored  but  $1  million  an-
nually for the Office of Policy.

Much greater emphasis on data collection is also necessary. Being able to answer
many  of  the  most  important  policy  questions  in  highway  transportation  requires
much better data. Research in the planning area to develop the advanced modeling
tools  needed  to  meet  federal  and  local  planning  and  environmental  mandates  also
require  better  data.  States  and  MPOs  rely  heavily  on  the  National  Household
Transportation Survey, which was dropped by the Bureau of Transportation Statis-
tics  (BTS),  whose  funding  was  also  sharply  reduced  in  S–LU.  (Fortunately  FHWA
and other administrations within USDOT have stepped in to provide stop-gap fund-
ing to maintain this critical survey.) Similarly, improved, and more timely, data on
freight movements is essential for improved planning; the Commodity Flow Survey,
which  is  still  part  of  BTS’s  portfolio  but  nonetheless  underfunded,  should  be  sus-
tained and enhanced to meet user requirements.

Proposals already circulating that address reauthorization of the surface transpor-
tation  program,  including  the  reports  of  both  SAFETEA–LU  commissions,  rec-
ommend  that  the  federal-aid  program  become  performance  based.  A  true  system  of
performance  measures  will  create  enormous  new  demand  for  better  data  on  inven-
tory  condition  and  value,  real-time  system  performance,  safety,  environmental  pro-
tection, and other performance metrics.

Technology transfer is another area of weakness, as I explain in response to Ques-

tion 3.
3. How can we improve the transfer of transportation technology from the R&D stage
to  deployment  and  adoption  in  the  field?  As  we  prepare  for  major  investment  in
infrastructure,  how  do  we  ensure  that  the  latest  proven  technologies  are  utilized?
Deployment  of  new  technology  and  practice  does  not  receive  the  attention  it  de-
serves.  It  is  important  to  recognize,  however,  that  FHWA  does  carry  out  consider-
able technology transfer activities. FHWA has extensive information on its program
office web pages about new techniques, as well as technical briefings, manuals, and
implementation  guidance.  These  activities  are  partially  funded  with  R&D  funds.
FHWA  also  administers  the  Local  Technical  Assistance  Program  (LTAP)  and  offers
training on new technologies and practices through the National Highway Institute.
FHWA’s  field  offices  in  every  state  are  also  sources  of  information  for  State  practi-
tioners. These activities, however, are not sufficient.

FHWA  formerly  had  resources  explicitly  devoted  to  technology  transfer,  which
were lost in 1998 in TEA–21, and the office that had specialized in this activity was
subsequently  disbanded.17 FHWA  then  allocated  technology  responsibilities  to  pro-
gram offices in concert with the office of research and technology, but this responsi-
bility  was  added  to  other  responsibilities  of  FHWA’s  existing  staff.  The  barriers  to
innovation,  however,  are  high  and  the  expertise  required  for  successful  technology
transfer  requires  a  strategic  plan,  dedicated  and  expert  staff,  and  adequate  re-
sources  to  overcome  these  barriers.18 The  SHRP  2  implementation  report  provides
a  model  of  what  is  required  to  assist  the  states  in  deploying  new  technologies  and
practices. In addition, the RTCC’s report indicates that adoption of innovations may
require  incentives  that  reduce  the  risk  of  trying  something  new.  FHWA  used  to
have resources, for example, that would allow 100 percent federal funding for imple-
menting promising, but not quite fully proven, technologies or techniques.
4. What are some of the lessons learned from the last reauthorization of the highway

bill (SAFETEA–LU)? What improvements can we make?
The  principles  for  research  articulated  in  the  preamble  to  Title  V  of  SAFETEA–
LU  are  good  ones  and  I  hope  they  will  be  retained  and  followed.  They  encourage
stakeholder involvement, competitive award of funding based upon merit review, ad-
vanced  research,  and  a  federal  program  that  spans  the  entire  innovation  process.
There are, however, too many designated programs and earmarks in SAFETEA–LU
that  constrain  FHWA  and  RITA  from  carrying  out  a  research  programs  consistent
with these principles, reduces funding to core mission activities of FHWA, and deny
the  agencies  flexibility  in  responding  to  emerging  issues  and  the  needs  of  stake-
holders.

STATEMENT OF MR. DAVID J. WISE, ACTING DIRECTOR, PHYS-
ICAL  INFRASTRUCTURE  ISSUES,  U.S.  GOVERNMENT  AC-
COUNTABILITY OFFICE
Mr.  WISE.  Chair  Wu,  Ranking  Member  Smith,  and  Members  of
the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  re-
search  and  development  and  technology  coordination  and  evalua-
tion at the Department of Transportation. RD&T (Research, Devel-
opment,  and  Technology)  activities  are  vital  to  meeting  DOT’s
transportation  priorities  such  as  increasing  safety,  enhancing  mo-
bility, and supporting the Nation’s economic growth.

DOT’s budget in this area totaled about $1.1 billion in fiscal year
2008,  primarily  for  projects  undertaken  by  the  Federal  Highway
Administration  and  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA).
Over the years we and others have raised concerns about DOT’s ca-
pacity  to  improve  RD&T  coordination  and  evaluation  across  the
agency. As a result, in 2004, Congress created the Research and In-
novative Technology Administration, RITA.

My  testimony  has  two  parts.  I  will  discuss,  one,  the  importance
of  coordinating  and  evaluating  RD&T  to  ensure  federal  dollars  are
used  effectively  and  efficiently,  and  two,  the  progress  RITA  has
made implementing the seven recommendations in our 2006 report
on  coordination  and  evaluation  of  transportation  and  research  at
DOT.

On the first point, in today’s environment of expected trillion dol-
lar deficits and stimulus spending, the need for careful RD&T deci-
sions  is  more  critical  than  ever.  Coordinating  and  evaluating  re-
search  are  key  elements  to  federal  stewardship  of  taxpayers’
money.  The  Committee  on  Science  Engineering  and  Public  Policy,
a joint committee under the auspices of the National Academies of
Science,  has  recommended  a  formal  research  coordination  process
to enhance collaboration, explore research questions, and reduce in-
efficiencies.

In addition, the committee notes that evaluating the agency’s re-
search  against  established  performance  measures  helps  assess  re-
search quality and achieve agency goals.

In  the  same  vein,  the  Government  Performance  and  Results  Act
(GPRA)  of  1993  requires  federal  agencies  to  set  performance  goals
and  measure  performance  against  those  goals  to  ensure  the  effec-
tiveness  of  federal  investments.  GPRA’s  emphasis  on  results  sug-
gests  that  federal  programs  contributing  to  the  same  or  similar
outcomes should be closely coordinated to ensure the goals are con-
sistent  and  complimentary  and  that  program  efforts  are  mutually
reinforcing.

On  the  second  point,  while  we  have  not  performed  new  assess-
ments  of  RITA  since  our  2006  report,  we  have  tracked  the  seven
recommendations  from  that  report.  These  seven  recommendations
are summarized in the table on pages three and four of my written
statement.

RITA  has  implemented  five  of  the  recommendations  aimed  at
preventing  duplication  of  research  efforts,  ensuring  research  is
evaluated  in  accordance  with  established  best  practices,  estab-
lishing  database  systems  to  inventory  and  track  research,  commu-
nicating  research  evaluation  efforts  to  Congress,  and  documenting
the  process  for  evaluating  the  results  of  multi-modal  research  pro-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:26 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047544 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\T&I09\021209\47544 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

grams.  RITA  has  implemented  a  strategy  consisting  of  ongoing  in-
ternal  reviews  to  coordinate  RD&T  activities  and  look  for  areas
where joint efforts would be appropriate.

RITA  has  partially  implemented  the  two  other  recommendations
directing  it  to  develop  performance  goals  and  overall  implementa-
tion strategy, an evaluation plan, and performance measures. As a
result, it is still a challenge for RITA to determine its relative suc-
cess overseeing the effectiveness of RD&T activities.

In  conclusion,  since  becoming  operational  in  2005,  RITA  has
made  progress  towards  becoming  a  DOT-wide  resource  for  man-
aging  and  determining  effectiveness  of  RD&T  activities.  We  will
continue  to  monitor  RITA’s  efforts  to  implement  our  two  open  rec-
ommendations.  We  look  forward  to  assisting  Congress  as  it  con-
siders RITA’s activities during the reauthorization process.

Mr.  Chair,  this  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  pleased  to
answer  any  questions  you  or  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  may
have.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Wise follows:]

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID J. WISE

We  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  this  hearing  on  the  Department
of Transportation’s (DOT) research, development, and technology (RD&T) activities.
RD&T  activities  are  vital  to  meeting  DOT’s  transportation  priorities,  such  as  in-
creasing  safety,  enhancing  mobility,  and  supporting  the  Nation’s  economic  growth.
In  fiscal  year  2008,  the  department’s  RD&T  budget  totaled  over  $1.1  billion,  pri-
marily for projects undertaken by DOT’s Federal Highway Administration and Fed-
eral  Aviation  Administration.  Coordinating  RD&T  throughout  DOT  and  reviewing
it  to  make  sure  that  it  is  evaluated  is  important  to  ensure  the  efficiency  and  effec-
tiveness of RD&T investment.

Over  the  years,  we  and  others  have  raised  concerns  about  DOT’s  capabilities  for
improving RD&T coordination and evaluation across the agency.1 In part to amelio-
rate  those  concerns,  in  2004  Congress  created  the  Research  and  Innovative  Tech-
nology  Administration  (RITA).2 RITA  is  responsible  for  coordinating,  facilitating,
and  reviewing  the  department’s  RD&T  programs  and  activities  to  identify  research
duplication  and  opportunities  for  joint  efforts  and  to  ensure  RD&T  activities  are
meeting  intended  or  other  goals.  These  include  activities  conducted  by  DOT’s  oper-
ating  administrations  as  well  as  other  RD&T  and  statistical  programs  managed  by
RITA  (e.g.,  the  Bureau  of  Transportation  Statistics  and  University  Transportation
Centers).  RITA  carries  out  its  responsibilities  through  multiple  groups  and  actions,
including  its  two  coordinating  bodies—the  RD&T  Planning  Council  and  Planning
Team—and  budget  reviews.  While  RITA  has  DOT-wide  responsibilities,  it  does  not
have the authority to direct changes in the operating administrations’ RD&T activi-
ties.  In  2006,  we  reported  on  RITA’s  progress  in  overseeing  RD&T  activities  and
made  seven  recommendations  to  enhance  RITA’s  ability  to  manage  and  ensure  the
effectiveness of these activities.3

My  testimony  today  addresses  the  importance  of  coordinating  and  evaluating
RD&T  so  that  federal  dollars  are  used  efficiently  and  effectively,  as  well  as  RITA’s
progress  in  implementing  our  2006  recommendations.  It  is  based  primarily  on  our
2006  report,  a  review  of  best  practices  for  coordination  and  evaluation,  and  follow-
up  discussions  with  RITA  officials  on  actions  taken  on  our  recommendations.  We
have not assessed whether RITA’s actions have improved the effectiveness of the de-
partment’s RD&T investment since our 2006 report. We conducted this work in Jan-
uary and February 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing

standards.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain
sufficient,  appropriate  evidence  to  provide  a  reasonable  basis  for  our  findings  and
conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained pro-
vides  a  reasonable  basis  for  our  findings  and  conclusions  based  on  our  audit  objec-
tives.

Coordination  and  Evaluation  of  RD&T  Activities  Help  Promote  Efficient

and Effective Use of Federal Research Funds

Coordinating and evaluating research are important elements in ensuring federal
dollars are used efficiently and effectively. RITA is responsible for coordinating and
reviewing the DOT operating administrations’ RD&T activities so that (1) no unnec-
essary  duplication  takes  place  and  (2)  the  activities  have  been  evaluated  in  accord-
ance  with  best  practices.  The  Committee  on  Science,  Engineering,  and  Public  Pol-
icy—a  joint  committee  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  the  National  Academy
of  Engineering,  and  the  Institute  of  Medicine—has  emphasized  the  importance  of
careful  coordination  and  focused  evaluation  of  federal  research  and  developed  prin-
ciples  to  help  agencies  evaluate  their  research  programs.4 The  committee  rec-
ommended  establishing  a  formal  process  to  coordinate  research  across  agencies.
While  this  recommendation  is  focused  on  cross-agency  research,  the  goals—enhanc-
ing collaboration, ensuring that questions are explored, and reducing inefficiencies—
are  important  and  applicable  within  agencies  as  well.  Coordination  of  research  en-
sures  that  information  is  shared  so  that,  if  necessary,  research  can  be  adjusted  to
ensure  a  field  is  appropriately  covered  and  understood.  In  addition,  the  committee
noted that evaluating research against established performance measures in agency
strategic  plans,  developing  measures  that  are  appropriate  for  the  type  of  research
being  developed,  and  using  expert  reviews  aid  in  assessing  the  quality  of  the  re-
search.

Relatedly,  the  Government  Performance  and  Results  Act  of  1993  (GPRA)  requires
federal  agencies  to  set  performance  goals  and  measure  performance  against  those
goals to ensure the effectiveness of federal investments. GPRA’s emphasis on results
implies  that  federal  programs  contributing  to  the  same  or  similar  outcomes  should
be  closely  coordinated  to  ensure  that  goals  are  consistent  and  complementary,  and
that program efforts are mutually reinforcing.

Making appropriate and cost-effective investment choices is an essential aspect of
responsible fiscal stewardship. Such choices are even more important in today’s cli-
mate  of  expected  trillion-dollar  deficits.  Careful  decisions  will  need  to  be  made  to
ensure  that  RD&T  activities  achieve  their  intended  (or  other)  purposes  and  do  so
efficiently and economically.

RITA  Has  Made  Progress  in  Improving  Its  Coordination,  Review,  and  Per-

formance Measurement of DOT’s RD&T Programs

In  2006,  we  made  seven  recommendations  to  enhance  RITA’s  ability  to  manage
and  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  RD&T  activities,  including  developing  strategies  for
coordinating  and  reviewing  RD&T  activities  and  developing  performance  goals  and
measures.  (See  Table  1.)  RITA  has  implemented  five  of  our  recommendations  and
is making progress on implementing the remaining two.

RITA Implemented a Coordination and Review Strategy, Developed a DOT-
wide  Database  of  RD&T  Activities,  and  Communicated  Results  of
Evaluations

Preventing  duplication  of  effort.  In  response  to  our  recommendation,  RITA  de-
veloped  a  strategy  to  ensure  that  no  unnecessary  duplication  of  research  programs
occurs  within  the  department,  incorporated  the  results  into  various  high-level  DOT
planning  documents,  and  reported  the  results  in  its  strategic  plan.  RITA’s  strategy
consists  of  ongoing  internal  reviews  of  all  of  DOT’s  research  programs.  These  re-
views  are  conducted  by  (1)  convening  meetings  in  which  officials  from  each  of  the
operating administrations share information about areas of ongoing and planned re-
search,  seeking  opportunities  for  joint  effort,  and  (2)  conducting  annual  reviews  of
each  operating  administration’s  research  plans,  looking  for  research  duplication,
among other things. In addition, RITA has formed eight working groups, in concert
with DOT’s operating administrations, to foster collaboration on cross-modal issues.
According  to  a  RITA  official,  results  of  these  reviews  have  identified  several  areas
for cross-modal collaboration, including climate change, freight capacity, security, al-
ternative  energy  technologies,  and  advanced  materials  and  sensors.  According  to
RITA  officials,  as  a  result  of  these  actions,  RITA  is  better  able  to  meet  legislative
and  DOT  requirements  for  coordinating  its  research,  leverage  resources  for  cross-
modal research initiatives, and prevent unnecessary research duplication.
Following  best  practices.  RITA  also  developed  a  strategy  to  ensure  that  the  re-
sults  of  all  DOT’s  research  activities  are  evaluated  according  to  established  best
practices. The strategy includes three primary mechanisms: (1) ensuring systematic
application  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget’s  Research  and  Development
Investment  Criteria  (relevance,  quality,  and  performance)  and  the  Program  Assess-

ment Rating Tool by the operating administrations;5 (2) annual internal program re-
views with self-reporting by the operating administrations; and (3) documenting the
operating  administrations’  external  stakeholder  coordination  and  review.  According
to  RITA,  reviews  conducted  in  fiscal  years  2007  and  2008  focused  on  how  well  the
operating administrations are implementing best practices, including external stake-
holder  involvement,  merit  review  of  competitive  proposals,  independent  expert  re-
view, research performance measures, and external research coordination. RITA re-
ports  the  results  of  its  reviews  to  the  department’s  RD&T  Planning  Council,  which
consists  of  administrators  from  each  of  the  operating  administrations,  including
RITA,  and  officials  from  DOT’s  Office  of  the  Secretary.  According  to  RITA  officials,
as  a  result  of  these  efforts,  RITA  is  better  able  to  determine  the  quality  and  effec-
tiveness  of  its  research  activities  and  investments  and  determine  whether  they  are
achieving their intended (or other) goals.
Establishing RD&T project databases. RITA created two database systems to in-
ventory and track all of DOT’s research activities and provide tools for querying and
searching individual projects to identify potential duplication and areas where oper-
ating administrations could collaborate. The first database, the RITA Research Noti-
fication  System,  captures  research  investments  at  the  transaction  level,  allowing
users  to  search  by  activity,  contracts  and  grants,  and  contractor  names,  enabling
identification  of  funded  programs  for  coordination,  collaboration  and  review.  The
second database is part of the annual Research Planning and Investment Coordina-
tion  (RPIC)  process,  which  captures  research  at  the  budget  request  level,  allowing
for  department-wide  transparency  and  coordination  of  proposed  programs  and
projects.  According  to  a  RITA  official,  eventual  combination  of  the  two  databases
will  offer  a  mechanism  for  measuring  and  tracking  investments  from  request
through funding and execution.
Communicating  evaluation  efforts.  To  communicate  its  efforts  in  evaluating
DOT’s  research  to  Congress,  senior  DOT  officials,  and  the  transportation  commu-
nity,  RITA  and  its  predecessor  organization  published  a  summary  of  all  research
program  evaluations  for  2004  through  2006  and  included  that  summary  in  a  high-
level DOT planning document and in a report to Congress. First, RITA’s predecessor
published what was essentially a summary of all research program evaluations con-
ducted  in  fiscal  year  2004—in  the  form  of  a  summary  of  the  results  of  its  review
of the operating administrations’ application of the Office of Management and Budg-
et’s  Research  and  Development  Investment  Criteria—in  its  2005  annual  RD&T
plan. Secondly, RITA developed a summary of the results of its fiscal year 2005 and
2006  research  program  reviews,  and  a  schedule  of  RITA’s  planned  fiscal  year  2007
reviews,  and  included  it  in  DOT’s  ‘‘Research,  Development  and  Technology  Annual
Funding  Fiscal  Years  2006–2008,  A  Report  to  Congress.’’  This  report  also  includes
summaries  of  research  program  evaluations  conducted  by  modal  research  advisory
committees, the Transportation Research Board, and key modal stakeholders in fis-
cal  years  2006  and  2007.  According  to  RITA  officials,  as  a  result  of  this  reporting,
RITA has provided better continuity and context to Congress and the transportation
community about the results of its research evaluations.
Documenting processes. RITA has also acted to document its process for system-
atically  evaluating  the  results  of  its  own  multi-modal  research  programs,  such  as
the  Hydrogen  Safety  Program  and  various  grant  programs.  RITA  evaluates  the  re-
sults  of  its  RD&T  activities  by  ensuring  they  align  with  DOT  goals,  meet  the  re-
search  and  development  investment  criteria,  and  are  subject  to  an  annual  peer  re-
view process. RITA has documented this process in its strategic plan.

RITA Has Not Yet Developed an Overall Implementing Strategy, Evaluation

Plan, or Performance Measures

Establishing  performance  goals.  In  2006,  we  found  that  RITA  lacked  perform-
ance  goals  and  an  implementing  strategy  and  evaluation  plan  to  delineate  how  the
activities  and  results  of  its  coordination,  facilitation,  and  review  practices  will  fur-
ther  DOT’s  mission  and  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  the  department’s  RD&T  invest-
ment.  RITA  has  partially  implemented  our  recommendation  that  it  develop  these
elements.  Setting  meaningful  goals  for  performance,  and  using  performance  infor-

5 According to the Office of Management and Budget, these criteria are rooted in best practices
and  include  peer  review  as  a  mechanism  for  assessing  program  quality.  The  Program  Assess-
ment Rating Tool was developed to assess and improve program performance to inform funding
and  management  decisions.  It  consists  of  a  series  of  questions  covering  program  purpose  and
design;  performance  measurement,  evaluations,  and  strategic  planning;  program  management;
and program results.

mation to measure performance against those goals, is consistent with requirements
in  GPRA.  Developing  an  evaluation  plan  and  analyzing  performance  information
against set goals for its own coordination, facilitation, and review practices could as-
sist  RITA  in  identifying  any  problem  areas  and  taking  corrective  actions.6 Linking
performance  goals  with  the  planning  and  budget  process,  such  as  DOT’s  annual
budget  process,  can  also  help  RITA  determine  where  to  target  its  resources  to  im-
prove  performance.7 Guidance  provided  by  the  Committee  on  Science,  Engineering,
and  Public  Policy  notes  that  evaluating  the  performance  of  research  in  the  context
of  the  strategic  planning  process  ensures  the  research  is  relevant  to  the  agency’s
mission.8 Without  such  goals  and  an  evaluation  plan,  it  is  difficult  for  RITA  to  de-
termine its success in overseeing the effectiveness of DOT’s RD&T activities.

According  to  RITA  officials,  while  an  overall  implementing  strategy  and  evalua-
tion plan has not yet been established, RITA has created performance goals. A RITA
official  told  us  that  the  RPIC  process—a  relatively  new  process  that  integrates  the
budget  and  strategic  planning  processes—will  help  in  creating  an  implementing
strategy. The RPIC process is meant to provide information to the Planning Council
and  Planning  Team,  which  is  responsible  for  defining  the  department’s  overall
RD&T  strategic  objectives.  The  RPIC  process  assesses  the  department’s  RD&T  ac-
tivities in terms of the following performance goals: (1) balanced portfolio (e.g., mix
of basic, applied, developmental, and high risk RD&T), (2) alignment of RD&T pro-
grams  with  DOT  goals  and  each  operating  administration’s  mission,  and  (3)  return
on  investment.  The  RPIC  process  has  been  in  place  only  for  fiscal  year  2009,  and
as a result, the Planning Council does not yet have the information needed to make
decisions  about  a  strategy.  In  addition,  RITA  does  not  yet  have  an  evaluation  plan
to  monitor  and  evaluate  whether  it  is  achieving  its  goals.  A  RITA  official  told  us
that  the  RPIC  process  needs  to  be  in  place  for  two  or  three  fiscal  years  before  it
can provide enough information for RITA to establish a strategy or evaluation plan.
Developing  performance  measures.  In  2006,  we  also  found  that  RITA  did  not
work with the operating administrations to develop common performance measures
for  DOT’s  RD&T  activities.  According  to  RITA  officials,  RITA  has  partially  imple-
mented  our  recommendation  that  it  do  so.  Without  common  performance  measures
for  the  RD&T  activities  of  the  operating  administrations,  RITA  and  the  operating
administrations  lack  the  means  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  collective  results  of
those  activities  and  determine  that  they  are  achieving  their  intended  (or  other)  re-
sults and furthering DOT-wide priorities. In response to our recommendation, RITA
officials  told  us  that  they  are  working  with  the  operating  administrations  through
the RD&T Planning Team—made up of senior officials in RITA and each of the op-
erating administrations. During Planning Team meetings, representatives from each
of  the  operating  administrations  share  information  about  how  RD&T  projects  are
measured  and  prioritized.  For  example,  according  to  a  RITA  official,  the  Federal
Railroad  Administration  measures  how  frequently  its  RD&T  projects  are  used  in
real-world  applications.  Once  representatives  from  each  operating  administration
have  had  the  chance  to  share  information,  RITA  officials  will  then  look  for  com-
monalities and determine whether any of the measures could be adopted for the de-
partment’s RD&T activities.

In closing, since it became operational in 2005, RITA has taken a number of posi-
tive steps to meet its vision of becoming a DOT-wide resource for managing and en-
suring  the  effectiveness  of  RD&T  activities.  While  we  have  not  assessed  the  effec-
tiveness  of  these  efforts  since  our  2006  report,  we  believe  that  RITA  has  made
progress. We will continue to monitor RITA’s performance in implementing our rec-
ommendations.  As  reauthorization  approaches,  we  look  forward  to  assisting  Con-
gress  as  it  considers  RITA’s  management  of  DOT’s  research  program,  to  better  en-
sure that taxpayers receive the maximum value for DOT’s RD&T investment.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  prepared  statement.  I  would  be  pleased  to  re-
spond to any questions that you or other Members of the Subcommittee might have.

6 Use  of  performance  goals  can  help  ensure  that  programs  are  meeting  their  intended  goals,
allows  programs  to  assess  the  efficiency  of  their  processes,  and  promotes  continuous  improve-
ment.  Where  activities  may  be  fragmented  or  overlap,  performance  information  can  also  help
identify performance variations and redundancies and lay the foundation for improved coordina-
tion,  program  consolidation,  or  elimination  of  unneeded  programs.  GAO,  Managing  for  Results:

BIOGRAPHY FOR DAVID J. WISE

Dave  Wise  began  his  career  with  GAO  in  1981.  He  worked  at  GAO  until  1991,
including  a  four  year  tour  in  GAO’s  former  Far  East  Office  in  Honolulu,  Hawaii.
Dave  then  moved  to  the  Department  of  State’s  Office  of  Inspector  General,  where
he  specialized  in  reviews  of  consular  and  international  programs,  with  a  focus  on
counter-narcotics. In 2000, Dave became a Foreign Service Officer, serving tours as
(1)  political  officer/narcotics  coordinator  in  Hanoi,  Vietnam;  (2)  Director,  Narcotics
Affairs  Section,  Vientiane,  Laos;  and  (2)  political  advisor,  Provincial  Reconstruction
Team, Helmand Province, Afghanistan.

Dave  returned  to  GAO  as  a  Senior  Executive  Service  candidate  in  September
2007,  where  he  is  working  with  GAO’s  Physical  Infrastructure  team  on  surface
transportation, communications, and real property issues.

Dave  has  a  BA  in  political  science  from  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  and  an  MA
in public administration from Pitt’s Graduate School of Public and International Af-
fairs.

DISCUSSION

Chair  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Wise,  and  now  we  will
open for our first round of questions, and I recognize myself for five
minutes.

Mr.  Brubaker,  you  referred  to  some  of  the  challenges  that  you
faced  as  head  of  RITA,  and  Mr.  Wise,  you  have—you  and  your  or-
ganization  have  performed  a  lot  of  analysis  on  RITA’s  functions.
There has been some reference to RITA’s responsibilities versus its
authority to implement what it is responsible for.

Mr.  Brubaker,  would  you  care  to  expand  on  your  experiences  in
facing  the  frustrations  of  that,  and  Mr.  Wise,  if  you  would  care  to
join in or any other of the panelists.

Mr. BRUBAKER. Sure. You know, I said sometimes being at RITA
I sort of felt like John Belushi in the movie ‘‘Animal House’’ where
he runs out of the room, and he says, ‘‘Let’s do it,’’ and nobody fol-
lows  him.  That  is  kind  of  how  it  felt  dealing  with  some  of  the  cul-
tural obstacles that we faced in the Department.

We  do  have,  frankly,  the  responsibility  and  the  authority.  The
legislative  authority  is  very  clear  about  what  we  are  supposed  to
do.  What  we  ran  into  were  some  cultural  obstacles  to  change,  and
I  have  got  to  tell  you,  I  am  kind  of  shocked,  and  GAO  is  used  to
getting  criticized  sometimes,  and  they  are  going  to  feel  weird  be-
cause I am a little critical that we actually met five of their open—
their  recommendations  of  the  seven  and  partially  achieved  two  of
them. I would strongly suggest they go back and really take a hard
look  at  all  seven  of  those  vis-a`-vis  RITA  and  see  really  the—and
make a judgment on the efficacy of how we responded because——
Chair  WU.  So  you  are  actually  saying  GAO  might  have  been  too

Mr.  BRUBAKER.  I  think  they  were,  frankly.  There  are,  I  mean,
they  may  not  have  reviewed,  we  may  have  just  done  a  really  good
job  of  responding  to  the  open  recs  or  something,  but  the  reality
from  my  perspective  was  there  was  just  so  much  more  we  could
have done from a select control evaluate perspective of the research
portfolio.  But  we  ran  into  every  mode  sort  of  wanting  to  play  hide
the  ball  and  protect  their  existing  portfolio  of  research.  It  made  it
very, very difficult to ensure that the underlying research was stra-
tegically relevant.

Now, we did, like I said in my opening testimony, we did achieve
a  level  of  transparency.  We  know  what  the  underlying  research

generous.

projects  are,  but  we  have  made  no  value  judgment  relative  to  how
they  fit  in  the  overall  strategic  direction.  Do  they  plug  in  nicely  to
the  strategic  buckets  that  are  described  in  the  strategic  plan?
Yeah. We were able to force-fit most of that research, but the grim
reality  in  my  perspective  is  that  we  weren’t  particularly  effective
at  creating  a  process  by  which  we  could  actually  control  the  re-
search  through  its  execution  and  then  evaluate  it  in  terms  of  out-
comes.

Chair WU. What mechanisms do you think RITA needs to imple-

ment, to achieve that?

Mr. BRUBAKER. It is like my good friend, Lieutenant General Bob
Shay  always  used  to  say.  At  the  end  of  the  day  it  comes  down  to
leadership. I think there is a leadership issue where the, you know,
you  have  got  to  have  strong  leadership  in  the  RITA  position,  you
have  got  to  have  accepting  leadership  among  the  modes,  you  have
got  to  have  strong  leadership  at  OSC  (Office  of  Special  Counsel)
where  the  Secretary  says  thy  will  be  done,  to  push  the  authorities
and to ensure that the authorities are actually executed.

At  the  same  time,  I  think  there  are  some  structural  things  that
are  missing.  Like  I  said,  the  National  Transportation  Research
Agenda.  I  don’t  see  that.  You  know,  we  have  got  this  RD&T  Stra-
tegic  Plan,  and  frankly,  again,  the  first  pass  at  it  was  a  force-fit
of  all  the  existing  research  into  the  strategic  plan  of  the  Depart-
ment.  It  didn’t  really  reflect  a  strategic  direction  or  a  very  good
alignment of research, the research portfolio to achieving the objec-
tives of the Department. That is what has got to happen, but it has
got to be broader than the objectives of the Department. It has got
to  take  into  account  stakeholders,  universities,  users,  economic  de-
velopment  people,  because  the  transportation  infrastructure  is  so
critical to the economic health and well-being of this nation.

We saw it over the summer when fuel prices went up, you know,
astronomically.  We  saw  the  impact  that  that  had,  and  frankly,  I
think  we  are  still  feeling  the  effects  of  that  increase.  What  would
have  been  great  had,  if  we  would  have  had  the  data  and  the  re-
search  capacity  to  do  modeling  and  simulation  and  be  able  to  un-
derstand  the  impact  that  that  would  have  on  the  supply  chain,  on
modal  choices,  and  ensure  that  we  were  responding  appropriately.
And  we  just  simply  didn’t  have  that  knowledge  because  we  have
never laid it out that that is strategically important.

Chair WU. Mr. Wise, I want to give you a cut at it, and a couple
of  you  also  referred  to  cultural  issues  in  research.  I  want  to  finish
up  that—with  that—and  I  will  also  announce  from  the  Chair  that
it  is  my  intention  to  use  a  soft  gavel  on  this  hearing  since  there
are only three of us here, but there will be a gavel, but please pro-
ceed with a set of answers about this topic and the cultural issues.
And then we will proceed to Mr. Smith.

Mr. Wise.
Mr.  WISE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  Also  thanks  to  Mr.  Brubaker
for  his  frank  opinions  and  interest  in  the  GAO  report  from  2006.
I think it is important to make a point that when we did this work,
which  is  now  probably  just  over—about  four  years  ago,  RITA  had
just  stood  up.  It  was  a  new  organization,  and  essentially  we  were
looking, it had just taken the place, after the Mineta Act of the, of
RSPA  (Research  and  Special  Projects  Agency).  And  we  were  basi-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:26 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047544 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\T&I09\021209\47544 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

52

cally  looking  to  see  that  processes  were  in  place  to  do  the  mission
that it was set up to do.

Quite  frankly,  we  have  not  been,  other  than  following  up  on  the
recommendations  that  indicated  these  processes  are  in  place,  we
have  not  really  done  a  formal  assessment  to  go  back  and  see  how
well the organization is actually carrying out all its responsibilities.
That  is  something  that  if  the  Committee  were  interested  that
maybe would be a useful project as the Committee sees fit.

So  in  that  respect  it  is  difficult  to  give  a  learned  assessment  of
how  well  RITA  is  doing,  because  it  really  wasn’t  the  focus  of  what
we did in that 2005/2006 work.

Chair  WU.  And  before  we  finish,  anyone  who  wishes  to  address
the  inertia  or  the  cultural  issues,  and  I  heard  that  mentioned  by
more than one witness.

Dr. Deakin, please.
Dr. DEAKIN. It seems to me that the cultural issue is really very
serious,  actually,  and  we  have  organizations  that  are  modeled  in
many  cases  for  building  the  interstate  highway  system,  and  they
haven’t  really  changed  the  organizational  structure  much  since.
They  are  very  hierarchical.  They  are  rather  slow  in  being  able  to
respond  to  things.  They  are  pretty  top-down.  That  is  not  true
across the board. Some agencies have actually tried to innovate the
organization structure, but it is pretty true for a lot of these agen-
cies,  and  there  isn’t  any  real  incentive  for  change,  partly  because
there  is  no  outcome  focus  in  the  legislation  and  partly  because
there  is  no  outcome  focus  in  the  State  legislation  saying  you  have
to show what you are actually producing in terms of cost effective-
ness  of  the  investments,  producing  outcomes  like  economic  pros-
perity,  lower  costs  for  users,  environmental  quality  improvements
that you can measure and demonstrate, greenhouse gas reductions,
more  equity  in  your  system.  We  could  give  them  those  kinds  of
mandates  and  say  we  want  reports  to  come  back  and  tell  us  what
these are going to look like, and we haven’t really done that.

Now,  Congress  did  that  with  reports  on  the  state  of  infrastruc-
ture  some  years  ago,  and  it  took  awhile  for  all  the  states  to  get
used  to  having  to  collect  it  and  report  it.  They  didn’t  always  do  it
well,  but  gradually  they  all  got  so  they  were  reporting  these  data,
and  those  data  have  been  very  useful.  So,  again,  giving  them  a
mandate  and  saying,  do  this,  let  the  best  states  do  what  they  are
already  doing,  and  it  gives  everybody  else  a  push.  Everybody  does
better,  and  you  actually  could  measure  outcomes  and  not  just  dol-
lars  spent  and,  you  know,  what  is  being  turned  over  but  see  what
we are actually accomplishing with these investments.

So  I  think  Congress  could  take  leadership  on  giving  us  some

clear mandates to show what we are producing. Thank you.

Chair WU. Mr. Skinner, if you——
Mr.  SKINNER.  Just  very  briefly.  I  think  Dr.  Deakin  is  correct  in

relating——

Chair WU. Microphone.
Mr.  SKINNER.  Excuse  me.  I  think  Dr.  Deakin  is  correct  in  relat-
ing  the  cultural  challenges  to  the  institutional  challenges  that  we
have,  and  one  could  imagine  an  institutional  arrangement  that  is
not  nearly  so  decentralized  without  so  many  thousands  of  players
who  are—who  own  our  transportation  system.  We  could  imagine

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:26 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047544 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\T&I09\021209\47544 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

53

that,  and  we  might  think  that  it  would  be  more  effective,  not  only
for  research  but  for  managing  and  operating  our  transportation
system.

And  that  may  be  true,  and  that  is  a  big  question.  But  from  the
research  perspective,  research  is  unlikely  to  drive  that  change  in
the  institutional  arrangements.  And  so  the  research  community  is
confronted  with  this  enormous  technology  transfer  challenge,  and
so  this,  the  question  of  stakeholders  and  how  to  involve  them  and
how  to  have  them  meaningfully  connected  to  the  products—and
connected  so  that  when  products  come  out  they  are  all  ready,  the
skids  are  already  greased  for  them  to  implement  and  try  these
products, that is a critical feature of any strategic approach to R&D
and surface transportation.

Chair  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Skinner.  We  may  return
momentarily  to  these  cultural  issues  before  we  move  onto  some  of
the  output  and  matrix  sides,  and  meanwhile,  I  want  to  recognize
other Members of the panel, particularly Mr. Smith, who has been
very  forbearing  in  permitting  this  series  of  answers  be  completed.

Mr. Smith.
Mr.  SMITH.  Thank  you.  I—this  is  all  very  interesting,  especially
as a relatively new Member to listen to the various challenges, and
I appreciate your willingness to tackle these. And I think it speaks
to kind of the largeness of the issue, the complication of the issues,
not  even  to  mention  funding,  that,  funding  of  research,  and  then
funding  of  carrying  out  that  research  in  a  useful  manner.  And  in
a way that leverages other opportunities.

I  know  that  we  had  some  controversy  in  Nebraska  when  the  di-
rector  or,  well,  when  a  person  said  that  the  Department  of  Roads
in  Nebraska  really  wasn’t  in  the  economic  development  business.
And you can imagine that there was some resistance to that state-
ment  and  for  good  reason.  And  when  I  look  at  the  various  issues,
whether  it  is  the  energy  issue  of  our  vehicles,  we  have  much  dif-
ferent issues in rural America than urban, wherein urban America
we  subsidize  less  vehicle  travel  and  virtually  in  rural  America  we
subsidize more vehicle travel with various roads and systems.

A  hybrid,  for  example,  the  benefits  are  less  meaningful  when  a
commute  is  done  at  65  miles  an  hour  or  maybe  a  few  more  miles
per  hour  on  the  way  to  work  and  home.  So  the  benefits  are  cer-
tainly less. So we—I think we need to allow some flexibility.

That being said, Dr. Deakin, if you would perhaps point to maybe
a  specific  research  project  that  you  could  identify  where  many  of
the  obstacles  that  have  been  mentioned  here  have  taken  place,
maybe  how  you  would  change  things  but  maybe  a  specific  project
as tangible as possible, if you could elaborate.

Dr. DEAKIN. Yeah. I would be glad to. The project that was men-
tioned by several people at our research was the installation of call
boxes  along  part  of  the  freeway  system  in  Northern  California  at
a time when wireless technology, cell phones, were proliferating al-
ready, and the call boxes I think had a useful life of about 15 min-
utes—a very, very short period because by the time they were actu-
ally  out  there  along  the  road,  most  people  were  already  using  cell
phones.

So  it  really  wasn’t  paying  attention  to  market.  The  project  got
put  in  a  pipeline  and  pushed  through  because  the  money  was

there,  it  had  been  allocated,  and  you  know,  you  get  in  a  program
or projects. But it wasn’t an effective investment of the funds.

That is a situation where I think that the remedy is pretty obvi-
ous.  If  there  had  been  more  discussion  with  the  cell  phone  compa-
nies about the technologies they were developing—and we were sit-
ting  right  there  with  Silicon  Valley  people  who  know  about  mar-
keting for these things.

I  disagree  a  little  bit  with  Bob  Skinner.  I  think  there  is  a  lot  of
research  on  how  to  change  institutions,  done  by  business  schools,
not  in  transportation  institutions  necessarily,  but  making  those
connections could happen.

I  think  there  are  opportunities  to  begin  to  think  about  how  to
really  bring  private  marketing,  private  knowledge  about  markets
and  also  university  research  on  institutional  change  and  markets
into  play  much  more  than  we  have,  and  that  is  how  I  would  fix
that kind of a problem.

Mr. SMITH. Okay. Thank you. That is a perfect example. I appre-

ciate hearing that.

In, even in places other than Nebraska, I am sure, we have what
I  think  is  a  response  to  gridlock  that  is  very  reactive  in  nature.  It
is  kind  of  like,  well,  let  us  wait  for  the  problem  to  form  and  then
we will solve it.

I  guess,  Mr.  Brubaker,  if  you  wouldn’t  mind  responding  to  how
we could get beyond that, what obstacles you currently see in place.
I  know  it  is  going  to  be  funding,  you  know,  a  part  of  that,  but,
again,  I  would  say  with  the  funding  issue,  I  mean,  the  more  suc-
cessful we are with conservation measures when we fund our roads
with  a  per-gallon  fuel  tax  and  there  are  fewer  gallons  being  used
but  yet  more  vehicles,  more  tires  on  the  road,  wheels  on  the  road,
that is not a sustainable formula. If you could respond.

Mr.  BRUBAKER.  Sure.  I  just,  you  know,  at  the  end  of  the  day,
yeah.  Everything  winds  up  being  a  resource  issue,  but  it  could  be
a resource allocation issue of existing resources to solve things like
congestion  or,  for  example,  I  mean,  you  heard  Bob  Skinner  men-
tion,  you  know,  $400  million  unencumbered  for  SHRP.  Well,  you
know, that is all fine and good, but is the $400 million better spent
in  some  other  areas,  like,  for  example,  congestion  mitigation,  for
example,  rural  safety  research  that  involves  more  than  just  roads.
It  can  involve  some  other  things.  It  can  involve  some  behaviors,
human factors stuff.

It  is  not  all  about  the  hockey  pucks.  I  mean,  you  know,  the—
sorry—the  concrete  research.  I  mean,  I  am  all  about,  you  know,  it
is great to have different types of asphalt and appreciate all the ge-
ographic disparity and the reasons to better understand and spend
money  on  research  for  concrete  and  asphalt,  but,  you  know,  we
have  got  to  kick  it  up  a  higher  level  and  look  at  this  more  holis-
tically  like  you  say  in  terms  of,  you  know,  what  we  can  do  and
where  we  are  best  spending  that  limited  resource  that  we  already
have before you start talking about more money.
Mr. SMITH. Okay. Anyone else wish to respond.
Mr. Skinner.
Mr.  SKINNER.  Let  me  just,  since  it  was  mentioned,  the  Strategic
Highway  Research  Program  implementation  effort  is  not  directed
at concrete and asphalt research. It is a large-scale safety accident

causation  project,  and  a  large  project  aimed  at  renewing  our  high-
ways  in  a  more  accelerated  manner  with  less  disruption,  longer-
lasting  afterwards.  Another  piece  is  dealing  with  non-recurring
congestion  incidents  and  the  like  and  figuring  out  ways  to  reduce
that  element  of  congestion.  And  another  piece  that  is  oriented  to-
wards  planning  and  environment  is  looking  to  streamline  ways  to
plan for new capacity in a more environmentally-sensitive and com-
munity-sensitive manner.

I think all those things would fit within strategic objectives that
one  would  come  up  with  for  the  Department  as  a  whole  and  our
transportation system.

Mr.  SMITH.  Okay.  Thank  you.  I  will  have  more  questions  later.
Chair WU. Thank you, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Lipinski. Please proceed.
Mr.  LIPINSKI.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  and  thank  you  for  holding
this  hearing  early  on.  I  know  that  this  is  an  issue  that  is  really
very important to me being not only on the Science and Technology
Committee  but  also  on  the  Transportation  Committee.  I  also  have
a  background  in  engineering.  I  studied  something  called  engineer-
ing economic systems, which was what it used to be called at Stan-
ford,  but  there  is  a  lot  of  operations  research,  optimization,  all
kinds  of  puzzles  trying  to—we  worked  on  trying  to  solve,  trying  to
give  us  the  skills  to  solve  these  puzzles,  which  really  relate  very
well here when talking about transportation.

There  are,  you  know,  endless  possible  goals  that  we  could  have,
and  I  think  it  is  very  important  that  we  are  here  talking  about
what  these  are.  I  mean,  are  we  just  going  after,  you  know,  trying
to  lessen  the  traffic  congestion?  Are  we  trying  to  cut  down  on  fuel
usage?  Are  we  trying  to  make  the  roads  safer?  Then  other  ques-
tions  of,  you  know,  talking,  besides  talking  about  roads,  are  we
talking about rail? What about just general inter-modal, you know,
transportation and not just for people but also for freight.

And  you  can  get  into  endless  questions  here,  which—and  we
could  so  much  better,  I  think,  be  using  our  transportation  system
that  we  have  and  planning  our  transportation  system  if  we  really
got our hands around some of these issues.

And  I  am  very  happy  to  be  here  in  the  Science  and  Technology
Committee  and  hear  a  witness  talk  about  how  crucial—Mr.  Bru-
baker  did—how  crucial  transportation  is  to  the  economy.  I  hear
that  all  the  time  in  the  Transportation  Infrastructure  Committee
but not oftentimes here. So it is good to hear that here.

So  I  just  wanted  to—there  are  so  many  different  things  that  we
could  talk  about,  but  I  just  want  to,  first  of  all,  a  question  for  Dr.
Deakin and anyone else who wants to respond. Are we really mak-
ing  sure  or  how  can  we  make  sure  we  get  the  best  bang  for  our
buck  from  money  that  we  are  spending  here?  You  know,  there  are
a  lot  of  great  ideas,  and  as  you  put  out  that  example  there,  where
we put the call boxes out on the road, but we missed the fact that
the  technology  would  be  changing,  and  it  really  wouldn’t  be  that
useful.

So  how  do  we—what  can  we  do  to  get  the  biggest  bang  for  our
buck  with  ITS  systems  and  the  deployment  of  ITS  systems?  I
mean, I see these signs along the road, electronic signs that I don’t

really  see  that  they  are  being  put  to  much  good  use,  but  we  put
the money out there so——

Dr.  DEAKIN.  The  signs  that  say,  congestion  ahead  when  you  are
already  in  a  stop-and-go  traffic  jam  aren’t  particularly  helpful  to
any of us, I think. But I think we are getting better at some of this.
There are some technologies that have more applications than oth-
ers,  and  this  one  example  I  would  give  you  relates  to  Mr.  Smith’s
question about what do we do about fuel taxes.

We are getting a lot better devices that would let us measure ve-
hicle miles traveled in obtrusive ways, ways that don’t invade peo-
ple’s  privacy.  We  all  know  the  fuel  tax  is  running  low.  You  know,
we could raise it if there were political will to do that, and it would
last for awhile. But cars have to get more efficient. They are going
to  change.  So  that  doesn’t  seem  to  me  to  be  a  long-term  strategy.
And  if  we  started  implementing  technologies  that  would  let  us
monitor vehicle miles traveled in cheap, fast, safe ways of doing it,
still  protect  people’s  privacy,  we  would  also  open  up  the  possibili-
ties  of  congestion  pricing  in  those  places  where  it  is  needed,  and
there is political will for it, which is not everywhere, but it is defi-
nitely some places. It opens up the possibilities for making it easier
for  people  because  I  could  pay  my  toll,  I  could  pay  my  parking,  I
could, you know, get around in my transportation system a lot fast-
er.

And  there  are  similar  things  we  can  do  in  transit,  by  the  way.
So I don’t want to make it sound like this is just for highways since
there  are  a  lot  of  options  in  transit  as  well.  That  is  almost  a  no-
brainer  in  my  opinion,  and  it  is  the  sort  of  thing  where  the  big
issue  right  now  is  which  technology:  are  we  talking  wireless,  are
we  talking  radio  signal  devices?  So  there  are  technology  competi-
tions,  but  in  some  ways  that  seems  less  important  than  the  fact
that  we  have  to  start  testing  those  technologies  and  giving  the
states both the authority and probably the mandate to do it would
be one way to get going on that.

For  making  sure  that  these  things  are  cost  effective,  there  is
nothing  like  doing  a  business  case,  and  that  is  what  I  have  seen
missing  is  really  the  development  of  business  cases.  And,  again,  I
think  business  cases  are  often  best  developed  by  third  parties  who
are  a  little  bit  at  arm’s  length  and  not  necessarily  the  advocates
of  the  project  just  because  you  need  somebody  else  with  eyes  on
this  to  make  sure  that  we  are  really  making  wise  decisions  on  the
investment. That is what we do when the private sector is working
properly, and we try to use business cases to test that.

And  then  post-hoc  evaluations:  we  just  haven’t  seen  very  many
post-hoc  evaluations,  and  again,  they  have  to  be  done  at  arm’s
length,  not  by  the  project  proponents,  because  if  they  are  not  at
arm’s  length,  then  they  are  always  a  little  suspect.  So  stepping
back—and  these  are  the  kinds  of  research  that  can  help.  There  is
a  research  component  to  that.  There  is  also  practical  partnerships
that  can  be  done  to  make  that  happen  better,  and  I  think,  again,
the legislation could help encourage that kind of arm’s length eval-
uation, learning from that arm’s length evaluation would then hap-
pen. They could require that business cases be developed. I actually
think  a  lot  of  the  DOTs  are  trying  to  do  this  and  would  welcome
having  that  kind  of  support  saying,  yes,  we  have  to  do  that,  we

57

have  to  spend  our  money  in  a  smarter  way  than  we  have  been
spending it.

And  then  focusing  on  outcomes.  Are  you  actually—what  are  you
actually  wanting  to  get  from  these  projects?  It  is  not  just  turning
the  dollars  out.  It  is  seeing  that  we  actually  have  a  lasting  value
that  is  cost  effective,  and  we  know  how  to  do  that.  I  used  to  work
in  Terman  [Hall  at  Stanford]  before  I  moved  up  across  the  bay  to
the  private—from  a  private  to  a  public  sector.  So  I  know  the  pro-
gram  that  you  are  a  graduate  of,  and  as  you  know,  there  are  lots
of people who know how to do these kinds of evaluations. We could
put them to work.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you. Mr. Wise, do you have——
Mr.  WISE.  Yes.  I  think  that  something  that  might  be  of  interest
to  you  either  in  your  role  in  this  subcommittee  or  on  your  role  on
House T&I (Transportation and Infrastructure) is that we have just
started  recently  some  work  on  real-time  traffic  information  sys-
tems. This is a subset of ITS. And of course, I defer to Dr. Deakin,
who is a recognized expert in this field, but just kind of getting into
it  in  the  beginning,  we  are  looking  at  some  areas  that  I  think
might be getting at some of the things you were alluding to in your
question.  And  we  are  looking  at  things  like  the  cupboards  that
exist  on  real-time  traffic  information  technologies,  the  information
that is available on the impacts and costs of the systems, and then
I  think  one  of  the  more  interesting  aspects  is  the  option  for  devel-
oping a nationwide real-time traffic information system and the po-
tential  benefits  of,  and  the  barriers  to  developing  such  a  system.
In  different  parts  of  the  country,  of  course,  it  means  different
things to different people. If you are in the western suburbs of Chi-
cago,  congestion  is  a  major  issue.  If  you  have  got  a  60,000  square
mile  district,  and  there  is  an  accident  on  the  interstate,  it  is  good
that  somebody  can  know  about  it.  And  as  Dr.  Deakin  was  men-
tioning,  there  are  serious  questions  about  the  technology.  It  is  a
very  fast-moving  target  right  now  with  lots  of  evolving  technology.
I  think  there  is  some  interesting  pilot  work  going  on  out  in  the
[San  Francisco]  Bay  Area  on  GPS  cell  phone  technology.  I  think
that  the  private  sector  will  probably  be  playing  a  major  role  here,
and the question is what will be the DOT or the government’s role.
So  there  are  a  lot  of  interesting  issues  out  there  in  this  area.  I
will  be  happy  to  keep  the  Committee  apprised  of  the  progress  as
we work through this issue.

Mr.  BRUBAKER.  I  just  want  to  mention  something.  On  this  Safe
Trip 21 pilot that Mr. Wise is referring to, you know, that is really
something  that  I  don’t  think  would  have  been  done  in  the  normal
construct. We actually were able to pluck that out at RITA and sort
of lead that but pull together a lot of different modes to make that
happen.  That  is  a  transit,  that  is  a  highway,  that  is  a  very—that
is  an  individual  mode  of  transportation,  be  it  bicycle  or  walking.  I
mean,  there  is  a  whole  host  of  things  that  play  into  that,  which  is
really kind of an interesting approach and a unique approach.

But  we  started  with  kind  of  the  outcome  in  mind  of  what  we
wanted to present, and as somebody who knows systems engineer-
ing  pretty  well,  you  know  that  we  have  really—we  really  kind  of
designed the protocol in a way that would support, you know, that
outcome that we wanted to achieve.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you.
Chair WU. Thank you, Mr. Lipinski.
Dr.  Deakin,  when  you  referred  to  Terman,  were  you  referring  to

Dr. DEAKIN. Yes, I was. That is the engineering building at Stan-

Chair  WU.  I  spent  many  a  lovely  evening  at  the  Earth  Sciences

Dr. DEAKIN. Yeah.
Chair WU. Wonderful place.
Mr.  Saenz,  did  you  have  something  to  add  to  the  last  back  and

Mr.  SAENZ.  Yes,  sir,  and  I  think  one  of  the  things  when,  you
know, the question was how do we make sure that we get the best
bang for the buck, and you know, I think it starts from being able
to  identify  some  goals  within  your  research  right  now,  really  some
goals in the management of the organization that will lead to some
goals or some—and then how do you measure them.

And one of the things that we started doing in our research pro-
gram a few years back is we put in place the teams at a high level
that were the experts, both from, on the Department side, academic
side,  and  even  the  private  side,  to  identify  some  goals  that  we
wanted  to  accomplish  in  the  different—the  research  management
areas.

And  one  of  the  things  that  we  really  looked  for  is  we  wanted  to
identify  some  research  that  would  result  in  the  implementation  of
a  technology  that  would  give  us  a  savings.  Very  similar  to  what  I
talked  about  with—we  used  some  of  the  national  research  in  the
barrier  cable,  but  even  within  the  Department  we  looked  at  what
can  be  looked  at  that  will  help  us  create  a  much  safer  transpor-
tation  system,  and  then  how  can  we  measure  what  we  are  accom-
plishing.

And that leads to ensuring that you spend your money in a safe

and wise way.

Chair WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Saenz.
Ms. Edwards, please proceed.
Ms. EDWARDS. Good morning, and thank you, Mr. Chair.
For Mr. Brubaker, I wonder if you could elaborate a bit on—and
good  that  you  are  the  former  administrator,  because  I  think  some-
times  we  can  see  things  differently  inside  versus  outside,  and  I
wonder  if  you  might  elaborate  on  priority  setting.  I  think  it  is
easy—it  is  an  easy  answer  to  say,  well,  we  just  need  more  money
to  do  X,  Y,  and  Z,  and  I  know  that  in  some  of  your  testimony  you
focused  on  priority  setting  and,  you  know,  rejiggering  the  kinds  of
research that we are doing. And so I wonder if you might elaborate
on that.

Mr. BRUBAKER. Sure. I would be delighted to.
You  know,  the—what  we  have  never  really  done,  again,  and  I
mentioned  this  in  my  written  testimony,  is  establish  this  national
transportation  research  agenda,  which  I  believe  should  really  be
the  driver  of  all  the  research  investment  rather  than  try  to  force-
fit, you know, activity that we are already doing, things like SHRP,
for example, that we are already doing into specific buckets.

And I don’t mean to pick on, you know, the Federal Highway Ad-
ministration,  but,  you  know,  they  kind  of  want  to  be  left  alone  in
that prioritization process, as does federal transit, as does rail. Ev-
erybody wants to kind of be left alone and do their own, you know,
research.

And  I  think  it  is  absolutely  critical  that  we  call  a  time  out,  we
take  a  step  back,  we  assess  what  we  want  our  priorities  to  be,  we
clearly state those in terms of what kind of outcomes we want. For
example,  I  had  the  Intelligent  Transportation  System  Joint  Pro-
gram  Office  under  my  purview  when  I  was  at  RITA.  I  actually
shared  it  administratively  with  the  Federal  Highway  Administra-
tion,  which  created  some  really  interesting  situations,  which  I  can
elaborate  on  off-line.  But  the  point  is  that  they  have  always  sort
of just been doing projects, and what I asked them to do was really
focus in on what they wanted to achieve in terms of, you know, did
they want to take a safety focus and reduce the six million crashes
that  we  have  every  year  using  Intelligent  Transportation  Systems,
making a big dent in the 40,000 lives that we lose every year. And
put those, make that a priority. Really design the research program
to have a measurable impact on reducing crashes, reducing the fa-
talities,  reducing  the  $230  billion  in  economic  costs  that  we  incur
every year because of those six million crashes. And put it in terms
of  outcomes.  And  then  how  do  you  basically  reverse  engineer  the
research program to achieve those results.

That is the kind of thing I am talking about but on a macro scale
for  the  entire  Nation.  What  are  like  the  five  or  six  things  that  we
really  want  to  accomplish?  Reduce  congestion,  greenhouse  gas
emission  reduction,  you  know,  rural  safety.  I  mean,  what  are  the
big impact things that we need to do. Then we need to look at that
$2.1 billion——

Ms. EDWARDS. And how to develop a system——
Mr.  BRUBAKER.  Right  on.  We  have  got  to  take  that  $1.2  billion
and  then  begin  to  plan  how  we  spend  it  to  achieve  the  outcomes
in those big areas. So that is what I am talking about.

Ms. EDWARDS. I appreciate that.
Let me just—Dr. Deakin, very quickly, can you talk to me a little
bit about what you think the appropriate role for social science re-
search  is  in  thinking  about  a  more  coordinated  transportation  sys-
tem?

And I want to just share with you, you know, I know locally we,
you  know,  we  have  an  economic  development  team  that  works  on
economic  development  in  one  spot.  And  then  you  have  a  set  of
transportation  people  who  go,  oh,  we  are  doing  an  economic  devel-
opment  project.  We  need  to  think  about  transportation.  And  those
things are thought about very separately, and so the rail people are
in one place and the roads people are in another place, and it never
seems that we are really looking at the linkages there.

And  then  how  are  we  going  to  use  that?  As  a  consumer,  what
does  a  system  mean  for  me?  And  so  I  wonder  if  you  could  talk
about  the  way  that  we  could  use  a  social  science  research  base  to
inform more strategic thinking around transportation planning.

Dr. DEAKIN. Yeah. I would be glad to. It seems to me that those
linkages are exactly where social science can shine and make a big
contribution to helping us figure out how to do this better, because

the social sciences, among which I would include planning and pol-
icy  sciences  in,  as  well  as  business  administration  and  manage-
ment  sciences,  as  part  of  a  bunch  of  people  whose  expertise  is  to
really  think  about  organizations  and  organizational  behavior  and
how  to  create  collaborations.  There  is  a  lot  of  work  that  has  been
done  in  collaborative  processes.  Some  of  that  is  theoretical.  Some
of  it  is  evaluating  different  processes  to  see  which  ones  work  and
which ones don’t and is very practical.

So  there  is  a  whole  range  of  social  science  work  that  is  looking
at how different organizational structures—how to flatten organiza-
tions  because  we  have  got  a  lot  of  evidence  that  flatter  organiza-
tions  are  more  efficient.  But  networked  organizations,  organiza-
tions  like  Google  are  not  highly  hierarchical.  They  are  pretty  flat,
but they have got a lot of networking and a lot of linkages. The im-
portance  of  informal  networks  of  knowledge  as  a  way  of  really
quickly getting new ideas out in the field.

It  is  not,  you  know,  that  people  go  and  read  papers.  They  call  a
friend  that  they  know  because  they  met  at  a  meeting  or  a  con-
ference  and  say,  ‘‘Hey,  what  is  going  on  in  your  field?’’  or,  ‘‘What
do  you  think  about  this  idea?’’,  and  how  to  facilitate  that  sort  of
behavior  instead  of  punishing  it,  which  actually  happens  in  some
of our current organizations. Don’t talk to your boss’s boss without
permission,  or  you  might  be  in  trouble  in  hierarchical  organiza-
tions.  Of  course  talk  to  your  boss’s  boss  and  then  tell  everybody
what  was  said  is  a  flat  organization  approach  to  that.  So  that  is
what  is  coming  out  of  the  social  sciences  on  how  to  restructure  in-
stitutions, new institutional ways of doing business.

Studies  on  public-private  partnerships.  What  does  it  mean  to
have a public-private partnership? That term captures a lot of ter-
ritory,  and  some  of  these  partnerships  work  well,  and  some  don’t
work well at all, and we really need to get that knowledge into peo-
ple’s hands about what has been effective and what hasn’t been ef-
fective. And it is social scientists who are doing that research.

I  think  it  is  a  question  of  specialization.  My  colleagues  who  are
mechanical  and  civil  engineers  and  electrical  engineers  and  com-
puter  scientists  are  really  good  at  what  they  do,  and  I  don’t  want
to  try  to  do  their  work  for  them,  because,  boy,  I  couldn’t  do  it.  By
the same token, they are not necessarily very good social scientists.
They  are  not  necessarily  the  best  people  to  be  doing  evaluations.
They are not necessarily the best people to be thinking about mar-
kets  or  institutions.  There  are  other  disciplines  that  do  that,  and
that  is  where  the  social  science  people,  I  think,  really  can  help  us
a lot.

Ms. EDWARDS. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Chair  WU.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Edwards,  and  since  we  have  had  a
couple  of  folks  on  this  side  of  the  aisle,  Mr.  Smith,  why  don’t  you
proceed.

Mr. SMITH. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr.  Saenz,  in  your  testimony  you  state  that  the  boundaries  of
various  State  and  federal  programs  need  to  be  defined  more  clear-
ly.  Can  you  describe  how  the  multiplicity  of  R&D  programs  affect
the planning and operations at TxDOT?

Mr. SAENZ. A lot of times as we are doing our work we work with
different  areas.  We  got  planning,  and  you  have  the,  more  of  the

technical side, and then sometimes we don’t have the good commu-
nication  or  the  good  coordinated  effort.  What  we  have  been  trying
to  do  at  our  level,  at  the  State  level,  is,  as  I  do  have  the  research
management committees, we also have an oversight committee that
is made up of all of the chairs of our research management groups,
as  well  as  our  key  administrative  staff  of  the  Department  so  that
when  we  can  coordinate  and  then  we  can—that  way  we  can  com-
municate  with  the  different  areas  as  we  go  up  to  the  federal  side.
We just, all I think we need is more cooperation, more coordina-

Mr.  SMITH.  Okay.  Thank  you  very  much.  You  know,  it  is  inter-
esting  as  we  hear,  you  know,  kind  of  a  request,  somewhat  of  a  re-
quest for more clearly-defined programs, you know, that, if you get
too  detailed,  then  I  think  we  discourage  that  cross-communication.
And so that is interesting, and I am not criticizing your suggestion
for  more-clearly  defined  responsibilities,  but  do  you  sense  any  ob-
stacles such as that?

Mr.  SAENZ.  No.  I  think  what  we  are  trying  to  get  is  I  think  we
need  some  definite  goals  and  then  we  can  work  together  at  both
the  State  and  the  federal  level  to  identify  these  strategies  as  well
as  the  implementation  plans.  And  then  at  the  same  time  we  can
define  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  so  that  we  don’t  have
the  duplication  of  efforts,  and  we  in  a  sense  get  more  done  with
less is where we are trying to get at.

Mr. SMITH. Okay. Thank you.
Chair WU. Thank you, Mr. Smith.
I  have  two  major  areas  that  I  want  to  explore  and  then  two
smaller  areas,  and  at  least  in  this  round  the  major  area  I  want  to
open  up  to  the  extent  that  folks  don’t  want  to  continue  talking
about cultural issues or inertia, because I want to fully explore that
topic before moving on.

But in a related field a number of you have referred to a concern
about  developing  a  coordinated  research  agenda  in  moving  to  out-
come-based  measures,  and  I  wanted  you  to  finish  addressing  any
of  the  cultural  and  inertia  issues  that  we  face,  and  the  challenges
of  moving  to  a  coordinated  research  agenda.  And  what  would  be
outcome-based  metrics  and  to  give  further  examples  and  then
elaborate on your written testimony.

Whoever wants to begin to take a cut at those areas.
Mr. Brubaker.
Mr. BRUBAKER. If I may, yeah. And I will try to keep my answers
a  little  briefer  than  they  have  been  in  the  past  here.  I  am  just  re-
membering  from  my  staff  days.  The,  you  know,  it  is  really  inter-
esting  that  as  we  look  toward  developing  a  coordinated  agenda,  to
understand  that  how  we  move  people,  how  we  move  freight  today
is  multi-modal,  it  is  multi-dimensional,  it  is  multi-disciplinary  and
keeping  that  in  mind.  So  you  have  got  to  bring—and  I  think  Dr.
Deakin really nailed it when she said, you know, how you approach
these things. It is not just a civil engineering problem. It is an elec-
trical  engineering  problem,  it  is  a,  you  know,  structural  engineer-
ing,  it  is  social  science,  it  is  economists.  All  of  them  have  to  be  in
the room to help develop this thing.

Chair WU. So the problem is siloed——

62

Mr.  BRUBAKER.  Siloed  thinking.  Right.  You  know,  you  go  to,  I
mean,  and  here  is  the  problem  that  I  have  got,  and  with  all  due
respect to Bob Skinner and TRB and Federal Highway Administra-
tion with SHRP, is that it is housed in Federal Highways. You are
more likely to get a Federal Highway type answer to the question,
even  though  it  might  be  taking  advantage  of  a  multi-modal  prob-
lem, even like cooperative freight research, for example, you know,
we  have  done  research  and  funded  research  and  are  aware  of  re-
search  where  we  track  shipments  of  things  like  seafood  from  the
Pacific Northwest down to the Southeast of the United States. And
we  see  that  it  travels  by  short-sea  shipping,  it  travels  on  rail,  it
travels  on  the  highways.  So  you  have  got  to  have  an  in-depth  un-
derstanding of all those things, plus the economics, plus the behav-
ioral issues, you know, to really understand how that system works
holistically.

I  keep  coming  back  to  this  term,  holistic,  because  things  really
are multi-dimensional and multi-modal and multi-disciplinary, and
you have got to break down that siloed thinking, and there is really
no place in the Department I think to do that other than RITA.

Chair WU. Anyone else?
Mr. Skinner, since you have been referred to.
Mr.  SKINNER.  Yes.  Well,  let  me  just—I  just  want  to  emphasize
what  I  think  is,  that  it  is  an  enormous  challenge  to  have  a  broad,
integrated research plan.

Chair WU. Uh-huh.
Mr. SKINNER. The transportation sector is roughly the same size
as  the  health  care  sector,  and  so  imagine  what  our  comprehensive
health care research R&D program would look like. Now, I am not
saying  we  are  as  good  as  the  health  care  sector  in  constructing  a
research  plan,  but  I  just  want  to  stress  the  enormity  of  the  task
that would be before us.

And  linking  that,  I  think  the  strategic  plan,  yes,  it  has  to  think
about  the  goals,  it  has  to  think  about  outcomes.  But  it  also  has  to
think about processes and how do we allocate our resources across
the entire innovation cycle so that some research that is of a high-
ly-applied  nature,  relatively,  can  be  implemented  fairly  soon,  and
we can judge it pretty easily, perhaps with respect to its rate of im-
plementation and its outcomes.

But  for  other  research  such  as,  say,  the  SHRP  work  on  under-
standing accident causation, crash causation it will be years before
that  fairly  advanced  research  is  translated  to  specific  changes  in
the  way  the  vehicle  is  designed  or  the  roadway  is  designed.  But  it
holds the promise of giving us the knowledge that we need 10 years
from  now,  15  years  from  now,  for  having  breakthroughs  in  under-
standing the interaction between the driver and the vehicle and the
roadway in accident causation.

Chair  WU.  Thank  you  for  that  insight,  Mr.  Skinner.  When  you
think  about  it,  the  health  care  sector,  the  transportation  transit
sector, and the housing sector are roughly equal in size. If you con-
sider  the  amount  of  research  that  goes  into  each  of  those  and  the
nature  of  that  research,  it  is  very,  very  different.  And  if  you  con-
sider energy savings, the building and housing sector is much more
ripe than either transportation or some of the other areas.

Anybody  want  to  address  the  out—I  am  sorry.  Dr.  Deakin  or
anybody  else  wants  to  address  the  metrics  side  of  this  challenge?
And Dr. Deakin, you may have something on the existing topic.

Dr.  DEAKIN.  Yes.  Actually,  I  have  been  doing  some  research  on
how  other  countries  are  actually  handling  this  problem  of  a  re-
search  agenda,  and  we  are  falling  behind  our  competitors  on  this.
The  EU  countries,  Canada,  and  Australia  all  have  been  trying  to
develop  these  kinds  of  strategic  plans  that  are  really  focused  on
outcomes,  and  the  kinds  of  outcomes  they  are  measuring:  Are  we
getting  good  value  for  dollars  spent,  and  what  is  good  value?  They
are measuring, are we getting faster, cheaper, more reliable trans-
portation service than we would have without that investment and
for  how—for  what  period  of  time,  because  not  all  of  them  last  for-
ever.  Are  we  reducing  greenhouse  gasses?  Are  we  reducing  pollut-
ant  emissions?  Are  were  providing  better  service  to  everybody?  Is
service  equally,  you  know,  equitably  distributed  to  our  population?
So those are measures of outcomes. You know, is there—basically
they  are  looking  for  economic  performance  and  economic  develop-
ment is certainly one of those things that you want to measure, you
know, did it help get you better, you know, more access to jobs?

We  can  argue  about  how  to  actually  measure  those  things,  and
there  is  a  lot  of  research  actually  that  has  been  done  on  what  are
good performance measures and not-so-good performance measures
that we can look to on this.

So I think measuring outcomes is something we can actually look
to  our  trade  partners  for  and  see  how  they  are  doing  it,  borrow
their ideas, and build on what they have done and go a step farther
and  get  ahead  of  the  game  on  this.  So  I  don’t  think  that  is—that
part I think we could do pretty easily.

I think there is a difference between focusing on what to do and
focusing  on  what  to  achieve.  I  mean,  what  to  achieve  is  the  out-
come  measure.  With  what  to  achieve  you  might  say  to  people,  you
know,  you  decide  what  is  the  best  way  to  improve  the  reliability
of  your  transportation  system,  but  you  have  got  to  show  that  the
reliability is being improved. And they pick—figure out what is the
best way for them to do it in their own situation.

An output—that is really different from saying a highway design
manual  where  you  have  to  look  it  up  and  do  it  by  the  book,  and
we have done I think a little too much of the ‘‘by the book’’ we are
going to tell you how to do it, and not enough of the, we are going
to focus on what you accomplish by making those investments.

The final point I would make, and this is echoing something Bob
Skinner just said, sometimes we do need to set aside money for re-
search that is not immediately tied to a product, because that long-
term  research  is  incredibly  important.  And  I  want  to  speak  on  be-
half of CalTrans on this. CalTrans had the confidence in its univer-
sities,  they  gave  us  matching  funds  for  our  transportation  center
funds  without  earmarking  a  penny  of  it.  They  didn’t  tell  us  what
to spend it on.

And  we  ended  up  with  a  very  mixed  portfolio  of  projects,  some
of  which  were  applied  and  actually  were  done  with  CalTrans,  but
some  of  which  were  on  topics  that  weren’t  on  the  national  or  the
State  agenda,  including  research  that  was  done  on  what  we  could
accomplish  in  transportation  systems  with  new  fuels,  new  vehicle

technologies,  and  other  technologies,  and  travel  demand  manage-
ment  strategies,  transportation  pricing  studies,  all  of  which  were
done  well  before  any  of  this  hit  either  the  State  or  the  national
agenda.

And  because  of  that  I  think  we  are  way  ahead  of  the  game  in
being  able  to  provide  leadership  on  these  issues  as  we  are  coming
to the conclusion we need to address these kinds of topics now, be-
cause we have got that research that started in the late ’80s, early
’90s  that  we  kept  building  on  it,  and  it  wasn’t,  we  couldn’t  have
said at that point, what did this study on transportation pricing al-
ternatives  actually  do  for  CalTrans  or  for  anybody  else  for  that
matter. But now we can look at that study and use it and say, well
here  are  some  ideas,  and  here  are  some  analyses  that  actually
show  you  what  we  might  be  able  to  accomplish  if  we  did  a  VMT
(vehicle  miles  traveled)  price  instead  of  a  fuel  tax,  or  what  we
might  get  if  we  did  congestion  pricing  and  how  effective  it  would
be,  and  where  it  would  be.  And  oh,  by  the  way,  what  are  the  poli-
tics  of  congestion  pricing  in  our  major  metropolitan  cities,  because
that is not a straightforward thing.

So we did that research, there wasn’t a clear tie to a deployment

immediately, but it has helped us 10 and 15 years later.

Chair  WU.  Terrific.  Before  I  turn  to  Mr.  Smith,  anybody  else  on

this topic?

Mr. Smith, please.
Mr.  SMITH.  Thank  you,  and  anyone  wishing  to  respond  to  this,
but  when  we  talk  about  the  matching  fund  requirements  and
changing  those  to  a  heavier  federal  side  of  the  funding,  what  do
you think, how would that impact, obviously it would free up funds
locally  or  at  the  transportation,  the  TRB,  and  given  the  fact  that,
and we have heard criticism of current research programs as lack-
ing  the  technology  transfer,  are  the  UTCs  (University  Transpor-
tation  Centers)  capable  of  turning  long-term  projects  into  the  real-
world  benefits  given  a  funding,  matching,  matching  funding
change?

Mr.  SKINNER.  Okay.  I  will  start.  I  imagine  this  is  a  topic  others
will address. You have a center director here with us, and you have
the former administrator responsible for UTCs.

And  the—as  mentioned  in  my  testimony,  a  committee  that  we
had  that  looked  at  the  Federal  Highway  Administration’s  research
program,  which—of  which  a  big  component  of  UTC  research  is
highway research. That committee recommended that the matching
percentage  drop  from  50/50  to  a  20  percent  match.  And  the  argu-
ment  there  is  that  many  states  were  not  operating  in  the  manner
that  Dr.  Deakin  described  for  California  in  that  they  were—they
did  have  expectations  if  they  were  providing  matching  funds,  and
those  expectations  were  towards  fairly  highly  applied  research
products.

And the universities have this opportunity, which Dr. Deakin has
explained,  to  do  longer-term,  higher-risk,  blue-sky  research  on  the
areas that we haven’t thought of, and our committee felt that that
was  being  stifled  to  a  degree  by  that  matching  percentage.  And  so
if  the  matching  percentage  is  reduced,  the  universities  would  have
greater  autonomy  in  setting  their  own  agendas.  There  would  still
be the opportunity for overmatches by states and others. Some uni-

65

versities,  no  doubt,  would  choose  to  continue  to  do  highly-applied
research, but other universities might choose to go off in the direc-
tion  of  longer-term,  higher-risk  research,  and  others  might  have  a
mix like Dr. Deakin described.

Chair WU. Mr. Smith, may I jump in just for a second?
I understand where we are going with this change from 50/50 to
a  20  percent  match,  but  can’t  you  earmark  just  as  effectively  with
a 20 percent portion and leverage the other 80?

Mr.  SKINNER.  I  think  in  certain  cases  that  would  happen,  but  I
think  it  would  certainly  happen  to  a  lesser  degree  with  20  than  it
does  with  50/50.  As  you  said,  even,  as  Dr.  Deakin  explained,  even
with the 50/50 California allows quite a bit of latitude.

So  I  think  it  is,  I  think  our  committee,  you  know,  whether  the
number  should  be  30,  should  it  be  15,  should  it  be  zero.  They  set-
tled on 20 as a step in the right direction.

Mr. BRUBAKER. Okay. I will go next.
On  a  non-controversial  subject,  you  know,  my  experience  with
the  50  percent  match  is  that  it  works,  and  it  leverages  the  dollars
that we invest into the system.

I  come  back  to  the—sort  of  the  fundamental  objective  for  what
historically  we  have  tried  to  achieve  under  the  University  Trans-
portation Center Program, and that is training the next generation
of  transportation  leadership.  That  in  many  cases,  in  fact,  in  most
cases  involves  training  individuals  who  go  out  and  work  in  the
field. Work in the field on applied—on real live applications, things
they need to do.

So  there  has  been  a  criticism  that  the  program  is  a  little  too  fo-
cused on applied research, and I don’t know that that is such a bad
thing when you are actually training people who need to go out and
work  in  the  field  and  be  marketable.  And  if  they  are  doing  really
the  squishy,  sort  of  basic  research  that,  where  there  isn’t  really  a
solid  performance-type  outcome  but  it  leads  to  other  research  or
further  sustains  the  knowledge,  which  by  the  way,  is  very  good,
then,  you  know,  I  would  expect  that  person  or  those  people  to  be
a little less marketable or a little less attractive to the field.

So, frankly, I think the program has been fairly effective. I think,
well, actually, not fairly effective. I think it has been very effective
in  the  current  mix  and  how  things  are  sort  of  arranged,  and  I
would  hate  to  see  us  tinker  with  something  that  I  think  is  fairly
well leveraged today and fairly well balanced and produces the re-
sult that we expected to create.

Mr. SMITH. Anyone else wishing——
Dr.  DEAKIN.  Yeah.  I  obviously  have  a  self-interest  in  this  topic.
We  have  over  100  faculty  members  in  the  UC  (University  of  Cali-
fornia)  system  who  participate  in  the  UC  Transportation  Center,
and  we  let  any  faculty  member  who  does  transportation  research
at any of our campuses compete for funds. The funds are reviewed
entirely  outside  our  university  by  people  who  don’t  have  any  close
connections. It is an NSF (National Science Foundation)-kind of re-
view  process.  CalTrans  also  reviews  them  and  then  we  meet  and
prioritize which ones will be funded.

We  use  the  USDOT  research  agenda  as  one  of  the  bases  for
prioritizing  what  we  fund.  We  also  use  Cal  Trans  research  prior-
ities  since  they  are  providing  matching  funds.  We,  as  I  said,  end

up with a mixed portfolio. We have produced literally 100 students
a  year  for  20  years  who  have  gone  to  work  in  transportation.  So
that is a pretty big chunk of people coming out of that program for
the  investment.  And  many  of  them  have  now  risen  to  positions  of
leadership.  In  my  home  state,  in  California,  both  assistant  direc-
tors at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission are graduates
of  our  program,  Jose  Luis  Moscovich  of  the  San  Francisco  County
Transportation Authority, Christine Monsen of the Alameda Coun-
ty Transportation Authority, Malcolm Carson of the LA DOT Com-
mission  for  the  city,  and  I  could  go  on  and  list  all  kinds  of  people
who have been out of school for awhile and have now risen to posi-
tions where they are in considerable positions of authority and are
really providing a lot of leadership.

So we are pretty proud of that as part of our product in addition

to our research product.

Frankly,  we  couldn’t  have  attracted  some  of  those  students  into
transportation,  into  transportation  as  opposed  to  another  area  of
work,  if  we  hadn’t  had  the  ability  to  offer  them  fellowships  and
graduate  research  assistantships  through  our  research.  And  if  we
got  hit  with  a  cut,  and  you  know,  CalTrans  might  be  generous
enough,  but  our  State  budget  is  in  a  terrible  situation  so  I  am  not
so  convinced,  we  might  get  some  of  the  match.  They  might  not  be
able  to  do  it.  I  don’t  think  it  is  because  they  don’t  love  us.  I  think
they do love us. I think it would be because they don’t know where
their next dollar is coming from.

So  that  kind  of  a  loss  of  match  would  certainly  hurt  us,  would
hurt  our  ability  to  produce  the  students,  would  hurt  our  ability  to
produce  what  I  think  has  been  overall  a  very  positive  set  of  re-
search  findings,  many  of  which  have  been  implemented,  many  of
which are changing policy and creating new ideas all the time.

So, you know, it is basically a cut in funds for the transportation
centers,  I  think,  is  the  only  way  to  realistically  look  at  that.  It
doesn’t  mean  that  we  couldn’t  make  it  up  later  when  it  looks  like
CalTrans  might  not,  we  might  have  a  budget  this  year  in  Cali-
fornia.  I  scrambled  around  and  looked  at  foundations  and  found
money  from  Hewlett  and  the  Energy  Foundation,  but  even  they,
now  with  the  downturn  are  telling  us  that  they  lost  30  percent  of
their  endowments.  And  so  that  is  not  even  going  to  be  easy  in  the
future.

So  I  think  you  have  to  look  at  it  as  if  you  cut  it  to  20  percent,
it is going to be a cut in the amount of funds, a cut in the amount
of  the  research,  and  a  cut  in  the  amount  of  product  that  you  are
going to get, and that is the only way I can interpret it.

Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Chair WU. Thank you, Mr. Smith.
A  number  of  you  have  referred  to  technology  transfer  problems,
consulting  with  end-users,  implementers  before  proceeding  on  re-
search,  in  the  course  of  research,  and  in  implementation  phases.
Could you expand on some of the pinch-points, some of the impedi-
ments,  how  to  overcome  them,  your  recommendations  for  more  ef-
fective tech transfer going forward?

Whoever wants to start. As an end-user. Mr. Saenz.
Mr. SAENZ. And I think I will tie it really to not just the research
program  but  the—anything  that  we  do.  We  in  Texas  have  25—the

state is broken up into 25 districts. Sometimes I think we have 25
Departments  of  Transportation,  and  a  lot  of  our  district  engineers
in  a  lot  of  those  offices  work  independently,  and  they  try  things,
and  they  do  things,  and  they  evaluate  things,  and  they  identify
best practices. And even within our state we were having problems
in  sharing  that  information  so  that  the  state  could  benefit  as  a
whole.

One  of  the  things  that  we  have  been  trying  to  do  as  a  whole  is,
under  my  administration,  I  put  in  place  an  assistant  executive  di-
rector that is working with all of our outside offices to ensure that
we  do  get  that  kind  of  information  collected,  presented,  using  dif-
ferent methods through, either through reports, through being able
to  use  technology,  chat  rooms  so  that  we  can  get  that  information
to  the  other  people  across  the  state  because  we  can  generate  some
efficiencies.

The  same  thing  can  be  done  on  the  research  program.  We  al-
ready  communicate  closely,  but  I  think  we  always  need  to  look  at
what  we  are  doing  today  and  how  we  can  make  it  better.  Because
we thought we were communicating as a state in sharing informa-
tion  district  to  district  because  they  communicated,  but  we  found
out  that  there  was  a  lot  of  things  going  on  that  one  area  of  the
state did not know anything about.

So  we  need  to  always  go  back  and  look  at  what  we  are  doing,
how  we  are  doing  it,  how  we  are  sharing  it,  and  how  could  we  en-
sure that we are doing it. Again, you measure your success of what
you are doing.

Chair WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Saenz.
Mr. Skinner.
Mr.  SKINNER.  We  could  talk  all  afternoon  about  tech-transfer,
and  I  would  probably  enjoy  it.  We  manage  cooperative  research
programs,  what  we  call  cooperative  research  programs  in  high-
ways, transit, and airports. Each one of those programs is governed
by  a  committee  that  is  not  created  by  TRB.  It  is  a—the  institu-
tional  arrangements  vary,  but  for  example,  the  committee  of—the
research  committee  of  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway
Officials  governs  our  highway  cooperative  research  program,  and
the  Secretary  of  Transportation  appoints  the  governing  group  for
the airport program, and so on.

These  programs  are  highly  applied,  and  so  the  tech  transfer
problem  is  not  nearly  so  great  for  that  kind  of  research,  because
stakeholders  know  what  their  problems  are,  they  program  money
to deal with those projects. Oftentimes they are connected with the
association  committees  and  the  operators.  And  so  the  panels  that
we  put  together  that  steer  the  research  have  the  people  on-board
that would help with tech transfer later on.

So that those kind of programs work very well, but I would never
claim  that  the  entire  research  program  should  be  comprised  of
these  programs.  They  are—they  don’t  handle  crosscutting  issues
very well. They are at the highly-applied end of the scale. They are
not doing the longer-term stuff. And for the kinds of programs im-
plementation is a considerable challenge, particularly when it must
ultimately trickle its way down to county road officials.

So  they  are  relying  on,  you  know,  there  is  no  perfect  set  of
things.  The  Federal  Highway  Administration  has  a  Local  Govern-

ment  Assistance  Program.  That  is  good.  Many  local  governments
have  terrific  relationships  with  states  and  depend  on  the—depend
on  minimizing  essentially  State  practices  and  materials  and  de-
signs.  MPOs—Metropolitan  Planning  Organizations—probably  de-
pend  heavily  on  their  own  network  and  individual  contacts  for  im-
provement  in  planning  methods.  And  champions  in  getting  states
to go out and pilot and then lead the way for others is terribly im-
portant.

So,  again,  I  just  would  stress  that  this  is  a  complicated  subject.
There is no one answer, and there are a lot of different tools in the
toolbox that have to be employed.

Chair  WU.  Well,  believe  me,  we  work  on  tech  transfer,  whether
it  is  from  NIH  (National  Institutes  of  Health)  labs  to  transpor-
tation  to  nuclear  detection,  and  I  guess  it  is  what  I  think  Boswell
or  Johnson  said  about  dogs  walking  on  their  hind  legs.  It  is  not
done well, but one is amazed that it is done at all.

Mr. SKINNER. At all. Right.
Chair WU. And a lot of the world thinks that we do it better than

most, but I am kind of amazed by that, too.
Mr. Brubaker, you had something to say.
Mr.  BRUBAKER.  Ditto.  I  couldn’t  agree  with  you  more.  Yeah.  I
mean, fundamentally, and I am going to say something which may
be  a  little  controversial  here,  but  it  is  designed  to  have  a  little  bit
of  an  impact,  but  I  don’t  think  tech-transfer  is  truly  a  priority  of
the Department’s research program, and it needs to be. I think the
priority  needs  to  be  clearly  stated.  I  think  it  needs  to  be  pro-
grammed.  I  think  you  need  to  take  some  element  of  existing  re-
sources and direct it toward a tech transfer and commercialization-
type activity.

I  used  to  serve  as  Chairman  of  Virginia’s  Innovative  Technology
Authority,  and  that  whole  authority  was  established  almost  exclu-
sively  and  initially,  when  it  was  initially  established  to  do  tech
transfer  from  Virginia’s  colleges  and  universities  and  laboratories
and  to  ensure  commercialization  of  the  most  promising  tech-
nologies. And Virginia, frankly, had done a really good job of doing
that, and helped manage the SBIR (Small Business Innovation Re-
search)  program,  and  the  context  of  tech  transfer  and  doing  some
other things.

So I come at this with that background. So I actually believe that
there  should  be  a  very  deliberative  program,  activity  around  tech-
nology  transfer  and  commercialization  where  we  can  glean  some
best  practices  from  some  of  the  universities  that  do  a  really  good
job,  some  of  the  State  associations  that  do  a  really  good  job,  some
of  our  overseas,  you  know,  folks  who  do  a  really  good  job  of  it.
Glean those best practices and apply them.

I  am  amazed  at  some  of  the  things  that  I  have  seen  in  terms  of
technology  transfer  by  some  of  the  universities,  particularly,  I
mean,  I  think  UC–Berkeley  has  a  good  program,  I  know  Texas
A&M  does  because  we  have  gotten  underneath  it  pretty  substan-
tially, and I think there are some clear lessons that can be learned
by that.

But  I  am  perplexed  because—and  I  do  think  this  is,  again,  a
function  that  really  needs  to  be  in  RITA,  and  I  will  tell  you  why.
Because  I  am  really  perplexed  by  how  you  can  promote  something

like  the  Universal  Freight  Shuttle  that  was  developed  out  of  the
Texas  Transportation  Institute,  which  is  effectively  a  new  mode  of
transportation. It is a monorail effectively that uses individual rail
cars that move freight containers through—from, you know, ideally
when it is originally, when it will be deployed, it will be Monterey,
Mexico,  through  Laredo,  up  to  a  land  port  in  Dallas,  Fort  Worth.
At least that is the initial design of it. But it doesn’t fit nicely into
federal  railroads,  it  doesn’t  fit  nicely  into  highways,  but  here  this
is this great innovation, and I know that they had a heck of a time
trying to figure out how to commercialize something like that, how
to get the knowledge out.

One  of  the  things  that  I  think  we  fall  victim  to  in  the  Depart-
ment  is  we  tend  to  have  researchers  and  create  forums  where  re-
searchers  talk  to  other  researchers,  which  is  a  form  of  tech-trans-
fer,  but  it  is  not  necessarily  getting  the  technology  out  in  a  forum
where it can be effectively utilized.

So I think we need to take a look at this. I think the Department
needs to make it a priority. It should be a priority in the next reau-
thorization, and it should be programmed and resourced effectively.

Chair WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Brubaker.
Anyone else on this topic of tech-transfer, impediments, and pro-

cedures going forward?

Dr. Deakin.
Dr. DEAKIN. I think there has been a model of tech-transfer that
it  is  something  that  happens  at  the  end  of  a  process,  that  you  de-
velop research and then you move it forward into refinement, after
refinement,  and  then  eventually  you  deploy  it,  and  at  that  point
you start doing tech-transfer. And that is, I think, a recipe for fail-
ure, that kind of a model. I think you have to start thinking about
users,  demand,  markets  in  the  beginning,  and  one  of  the—if  it  is
short-term  research  as  Bob  Skinner  pointed  out,  that  is  easier  to
do than if it is long-term research. But in other areas we have busi-
ness  councils  and  business  science,  science  councils  that  help  talk
about  these  things  and  keep  this  on  track.  And  there  are  other
mechanisms I think that could be devised that would help us inte-
grate  thinking  about  what  is—where  are  we  headed,  what  is  the
vision for this, what is the scenario that we have in mind.

Mr.  Saenz  was  saying  to  me  that  he  thought  that  the  things  we
ought  to  be  doing  are  scenario  planning  and  use,  having  think
tanks but also doing scenario planning and then doing evaluations
on projects. Each of those could use some guidance from people who
are  really  thinking,  what  is  the  vision  here  that  we  have.  Is  that
a realistic vision, challenging that at the beginning, sharpening up
that vision of where it is going.

Let  me  give  you  an  example.  A  problem  we  have  in  California
a lot is that people say, gee, if we could manage the freeway system
and  the  arterial  system  as  a  couplet,  then  everything  would  be  a
lot  more  efficient,  and  we  could  spread  traffic  around,  and  we
wouldn’t  have  so  much  congestion.  We  could  put,  you  know,  make
use  of  the  capacity  better.  Well,  if  the  arterial  happens  to  be  the
kind of arterial where having more traffic on it is okay, that might
work. But two-thirds of the time, in my experience, those arterials
are  also  main  street,  residential  streets,  shopping  streets.  They
have got all kinds of other values associated with them, and maxi-

mizing throughput is not the objective of the owners of those facili-
ties.

And  so  we  actually  had  to  change  our  thinking  about  that  and
recognized that we have to do context-sensitive design and context-
sensitive  operation.  But  I  still  hear  some  of  my  colleagues  on  the
technology  side  say,  gee,  if  we  could  only  operate  this  system  as  a
whole,  not  even  recognizing  that  there  are  these  other  values  that
have to be brought in.

And  that  is  just  a  question  of  not  communicating  with  the  right
people,  because  other  people  could  tell  them,  let  us  talk  about  the
context in which that will work and the context in which that won’t
work.

So  starting  to  think  about  deployment,  starting  to  think  about
markets  and  public  consent  and  people’s  values  and  what  is  being
proposed  fits  with  values  and  markets  and  preferences  really  from
the  beginning  seems  to  me  to  be  critical  to  make  tech-transfer
work.

Chair WU. Thank you very much, Dr. Deakin.
Before  we  turn  to  what  I  hope  to  be  one  final  topic  here,  Mr.
Skinner,  since  I  made  an  at-best  neutral  comment  about  one  of
your  findings  earlier,  I  wanted  to  return  to  that  and  give  you  a
chance to address it.

In your written testimony there was a number of a $400 million
increase  in  research  funding,  and  before  we  head  into  a,  shall  we
say,  disjuncture  between  aspirations  and  resistance  to  additional
research funding, I want to ask you about where you get your num-
ber  about  0.9  percent  of  sales,  research  for  transportation  versus
3.6  percent  of  sales  in  other  industries.  And  then,  and  also  to  give
you  a  chance  to  address  what  I  take  you  to  say  as  not  just  an  in-
crease in current surface transportation research but perhaps a re-
orientation  of  that  research  into  other  fields  where  there  may  be
current research going on but to associate that with transportation.

Please proceed, Mr. Skinner.
Mr.  SKINNER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  That  is  quite  a  lot.  Let  me
first  start  by  saying  that  I  certainly  didn’t  want  to  leave  the  im-
pression, and I don’t think our reports wanted, committees wanted
to  leave  the  impression,  that  the  answer  is  money,  and  money
alone.

Chair WU. We have parallel goals.
Mr. SKINNER. That regardless of what—of the resources that are
available,  there  are  a  variety  of  things  that  our  committees  have
documented—and  are  in  my  written  testimony—that  we  can  do  to
make  our  research  programs—technology  programs  more  effective.
The 0.9 percent of total expenditures is arrived at simply by add-
ing  up  all  of  the  highway  research  program  spending  that  we  can
find  in  the  United  States  and  comparing  that  to  total  highway  ex-
penditures,  and  that  compares  with  this,  you  know,  three  percent
figure,  which  comes  from—it  is  not  compiled  by  us.  It  is  probably
compiled  by  the  Commerce  Department.  It  is  referenced  in  our  re-
port.

And  I  think  you  will  find  in  the  private  sector  that  even  mature

industries spend at least one percent and——

Chair  WU.  Let  me  ask  you  about  that.  You  are  probably  includ-
ing  industries  like  pharmaceuticals  where  the  spending  is  in  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:26 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047544 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\T&I09\021209\47544 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

mid teens. You might be including technology industries where the
spending  is  at  a  slightly  higher  percentage.  But  if  you  compare  it
to,  shall  we  say,  heavy  industries,  like  steel  or  ag,  that  might  be
perhaps  more—although  it  is  unfair  because  we  are  also  talking
about computer systems and transportation.

Mr.  SKINNER.  That  is  right.  You  are  making  my  point,  that  it  is
quite a range. It is one, you know, one to ten to fifteen percent, de-
pending  on  these  very  high-tech  industry  and  the  like.  And  my
point  there  is  that  this  is  not  a  low-tech  industry.  Yes,  we  have
very  mature  technologies  that  are  difficult  to  change  like  asphalt
and  concrete,  but  we  have  Intelligent  Transportation  Systems,  we
have  very  complicated  institutional  problems  that  the  private  sec-
tor  doesn’t  deal  with.  We  have  behavioral  issues  related  to  safety,
and travel demand, and the like.

So,  yes,  you  know,  as  to  where  we  should  be  in  that  spectrum,
we are just observing that we are on the, you know, on the low end.
Chair  WU.  So  it  is  different  percentages,  if  you  will,  different—
a  different  baseline  for  different  parts  of  transportation  research
because  it  is  a  large  segment  of  the  economy  just  like  health  care,
just like construction.

Mr.  SKINNER.  Right.  I  mean,  we  spend,  I  think,  probably  three
times  more  to  try  and  save  a  life  in  our  cancer  research  than  we
do  in  research  related  to  highway  safety.  So—but  now  let  me—so
that is the first number. Where I got the 0.9 percent.

The  other  one  was  the  $400  million,  which  is  relating  to,  you
know,  the  total  expenditure  that  we  estimated  in  a  Congression-
ally-requested  study  on  the  implementation  of  the  Strategic  High-
way Research Program products. And there is a little bit of a crys-
tal  ball  work  there  because  the  research  program  is  still  just  fully
underway, and we were required to submit a report this year.

But it is, we—it is illustrative of how much importance our com-
mittee  placed  on  the  tech  transfer  process  and  its  complexity.  In
this  particular  case  I  will  say  that  there  is  a  bit  of  apples  and  or-
anges,  because  this—I  referred  earlier  to  the  accident  causation
piece  of  it,  where  at  the  end  of  the  SHRP  program,  we  will  have
a  very  large  database.  So  the  $400  million  also  includes  the  care
and  feeding  of  that  database,  as  well  as  further  research  on  the—
on  that  database,  which  will  hopefully  give  us  the  products  that
will make their way into vehicle design and roadway design.

Chair  WU.  Now,  do  you  have  a  recommendation  about  a  proper
amount  of  funding  for  the  next  appropriations  period,  for  the  next
highway  bill  period,  and  what  the  uptake  limitation  might  be  for
the research infrastructure that we currently have in place?

Mr. SKINNER. Thankfully, I do not have a recommendation.
Chair  WU.  I  will  tell  you  what.  For  each  of  the  panelists  and
your  friends  in  the  research  community,  that  is  a  question  that  I
am  very,  very  interested  in,  and  I  am  sure  that  other  Members  of
the  Committee  would  be  very  interested  in  that  as  we  develop  the
research title of this reauthorization.

Mr.  SKINNER.  Right.  I  mean,  our  committee  has,  you  know,  we
have  observed  that  we  could,  you  know,  we  could—more  money
could be justified, but certainly if the money were doubled or some-
thing of that nature, there would be the capacity issue that you are
referring  to.  And  regardless  of  the  money,  there  are  a  host  of  re-

forms  that  we  can  make  to  make  the  overall  program  more  effec-
tive.

Chair WU. Terrific. Thank you very much, Mr. Skinner.
Anybody else on that topic before—Mr. Brubaker.
Mr.  BRUBAKER.  Yeah.  I  mean,  I  come  back  to  this  that  I  said  in
my  oral  testimony  and  that  I  referred  to  in  my  written  testimony,
and that is that I think it is really difficult to assign, I don’t know
how  you  can  assign  a  number  as  to  what  the  right  number  is  for
what we should be spending on transportation research.

I go back to that national transportation research agenda as sort
of  being  the  driver.  The  right  number  is  the  number  that  it  takes
to  spend  on  research  to  achieve  the  outcomes  that  you  are  looking
to achieve. But I would really caution that the thing to do or to en-
sure as part of the process is that there is an ability to select, con-
trol,  and  evaluate  the  research  portfolio.  That  is—and  I  view  that
as  an  inherently-governmental  function.  It  should  rest  somewhere
in  the  Department.  In  fact,  I  think  it  should,  the  development  of
that  plan  and  the  monitoring,  the  execution  I  believe  should  rest
in RITA.

You know, and moreover, I mean, if somebody really wants to in-
crease  the  funding,  maybe  make  it,  maybe  gate  that  funding,
maybe  make  it,  you  know,  there  is  a  percentage  increase  that  in-
creases every year of the authorization where, perhaps, it is predi-
cated on successful implementation of such a construct of oversight,
if you will, where you are actually controlling and evaluating those
underlying research programs.

That  I  think  would  be  a  responsible,  frankly,  approach  to  that

type of a discussion.

Chair WU. Terrific. Thank you.
Dr. Deakin.
Dr.  DEAKIN.  I  guess  I  take  a  slightly  different  way  of  thinking
about  this  myself.  We  could  draw  a  technology  innovation  curve
and think about that as when you are first starting to develop tech-
nologies, high risk, potentially high payoff, you have to spend a lot
of money on research. When technologies are well understood, well
deployed,  the  rate  of  change,  rate  of  innovations  slows  down  a  bit
(and  this  is  over-simplification,  obviously),  you  don’t  need  as  much
research money.

And  so  the  question  is  not  just  a  question  of  how  much  do  you
need  in  transportation  but  what  are  you  going  to  do  in  transpor-
tation  and  where  do  you  want  to  put  that  money,  on  the  innova-
tions  or  on  the  stuff  that  is  relatively  stable?  And  that  is  a  curve,
and  you  can  actually  do  an  analysis  and  figure  some  of  that  out,
I think, a little better than maybe we have done in the past.

We have had a tendency to staple together everybody’s proposals
in  the  past,  and  stapling  is  not  the  best  way  to  do  this,  I  don’t
think.

The  other  piece  of  it  is,  I  think,  this  is  a  huge  question  about
what  you  want  to  count  as  being  as  part  of  the  problem,  part  of
the  problem  set.  If  you  think  about  the  supply  of  transportation,
just the supply, you have got vehicles, fuels, operations, and facili-
ties. And DOT doesn’t do most of the vehicles and fuels. Those are
actually  private  sector,  EPA  (Environmental  Protection  Agency)
and  DOE  (Department  of  Energy).  And  if  you  are  going  to  talk

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:26 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047544 PO 00000 Frm 00080 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\T&I09\021209\47544 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

differently.

about  transportation  systems  improving  as  a  whole,  and  you  are
only  talking  about  the  facilities  and  operations,  you  are  already
shooting yourself in one foot. If you don’t recognize that the private
sector has to be part of that discussion because they are producing
most of what we are talking about, you are shooting yourself in the
other foot.

So it seems to me that that is a big issue that the way DOT has
been  organized  and  the  difficulty  that  DOTs  had,  not  just  inter-
nally,  which  Mr.  Brubaker  spoke  about,  but  also  in  creating  those
partnerships  that  go  to  EPA,  that  go  to  DOE,  that  go  to  the  De-
partment  of  Agriculture,  that  go  to  Housing  [and  Urban  Develop-
ment] (because there is a big housing and community development
aspect)  that  go  to  Commerce  on  the  economic  development  aspect,
are  also  part  of  what  would  really  have  to  be  discussed  seriously
here.  And  that  affects  how  much  money  you  want  to  spend  in  re-
search.  You  know,  it  doesn’t  seem  to  me  that  all  the  research  is
necessarily  going  to  be  inside  Department  of  Transportation.  It
might  be  in  these  kind  of  new  forms  of  organizations  that  might
be  semi-formal,  that  is  they  might  be  partnerships  mandated  by
Congress  among  agencies  that  create  networks  and  advisory  com-
mittees to supervise how the dollars are spent.

They  are  really  different  from  what  you  have  been  doing.  They
are not all internal. It might not be in RITA at all, or it might have
RITA  manage  part  of  the  process  but  have  to  be  told  to  create
these partnerships and do it in a different way.

So  I  just  think  we  could  open  this  up  and  really  think  about  it

Chair  WU.  And  that  is  part  of  the  opportunity  and  the  frustra-
tion  of  this  moment.  You  are  quite  correct  that  the  transportation
issues  are  not  just  in  DOT,  and  it  would  be  much  better  to  have
linkages  between  DOT  and  DOE,  for  example,  but  this  committee,
or  this,  the  larger  Science  and  Technology  Committee,  does  have
jurisdiction over the research components of DOE and DOT.

And  the  opportunity  is  that  the  new  Energy  Secretary  is  very,
very enthusiastic about moving forward on a broader front and co-
ordinating  with  other  agencies  and  is  very  cognizant  of  issues  of
culture and inertia.

In fact, to speed up the research process in his agency, he is look-
ing at bringing in folks from ag because they have dispersed funds
faster, traditionally.

Mr. BRUBAKER. Right.
Chair  WU.  So  that  is  part  of  the  reason  why  we  focused  on  cul-
tural  issues  a  little  bit  because,  you  know,  there  is  a  lot  of  discus-
sion  about  how  to  get  agencies  reoriented  to  address  issues.  I
mean, we push legislation out of here, and we kind of assume that
it  is  done  when  we  push  legislation  out,  and  it  could  be  three  to
five years later and it hasn’t hit the ground yet.

Mr. BRUBAKER. Right.
Chair  WU.  And  I  just  want  to  be  very  sensitive  to  the  multiple

layers that it has to go through before it hits the ground.

Mr. Brubaker.
Mr. BRUBAKER. Can I—I would like to add something to that be-
cause  I  think  we  did  something  fairly  unique  when  I  was  over  at
DOT  that  in  the  alternative  fuels  arena  where  we  did  engage  the

Department  of  Energy,  and  we  had  really  close  relationships  with
the  folks  in  EERE,  on—the  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  [En-
ergy]  folks.  We  had  good  relationships  with  them,  particularly  as
it  related  to  hydrogen  fuel  cell  vehicles  and  battery  development
and some of the things that we were really interested in.

To  my  knowledge,  and  I  don’t  know,  I  hope  that  that  activity  is
still  going  on,  but  that  was  informal,  and  I  think  as  we  begin  to
have, you know, a new generation of people who come into the gov-
ernment, government service, and are used to collaborating and are
used  to  dealing  with  Facebook  and  are  used  to  picking  up  the
phone  and  asking  people  questions  no  matter  where  they  sit  or
what organizational stovepipe they are in, that is going to be more
of the rule rather than the exception.

But  I  will  tell  you,  I  got  a  lot  of  raised  eyebrows  when  I  first
started  to  engage  our  colleagues  at  the  Department  of  Energy  on
these  issues,  and  initially,  you  know,  there  was  some  dancing
around,  turf  battles,  and,  you  know,  like  whose  turf  is  what,  but
when  we  broke  through  all  that  stuff,  I  think  we  had—and  they
played an integral part in the success of a hydrogen road tour that
we  did  over  the  summer  where  we  took  a  fleet  of  hydrogen  fuel-
celled vehicles from Maine to Los Angeles, across the country. And
we were in lockstep for that particular project. That wasn’t formal.
It wasn’t mandated by anybody. It was just something that we did.
At the same time at the secretarial level we were not at the plate
at all when gas prices were going through the roof, but the impact
that those fuel prices were having, you know, at—on the transpor-
tation infrastructure, on our supply chain, our passenger movement
system  was  profound.  And  it  is  unfortunate,  but  I  almost  think  it
is  sort  of  a  generational  issue  where  people  are  used  to  collabo-
rating  who—when  they  are  somewhat  younger  or  more,  you  know,
more  interested  in  that  sort  of  thing.  And  when  you  get  to  sort  of
the older folks who are used to working in their rigid agencies, and
you  know,  they  are  getting  advice  that  they  have  to  stay  in  that
lane,  that  occurs.  And  fortunately,  I  think  technology  is  going  to
break  down  all  that  stuff  ultimately  but—and  create  new  para-
digms  for  work,  but  I  just  wanted  to  offer  that  concrete  example,
although it is not a concrete example.

Chair  WU.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  have  always  thought  of  my-
self  as  a  young  pup,  but  now  as  I  get  older  I  find  that,  you  know,
I  am  more  sympathetic  to  the  old  dogs  and  maybe  I  am  one,  but
there  has  been  constant  reference  to  the  sociological  aspects  of  or-
ganizations and technology and a more intermodal approach rather
than a pyramidal approach to problems and organizations.

Anybody else on this topic before we move onto my final one. And
I  will  also  give  you  all  a  chance  for  a  catch-all  at  the  end  of  this.
Well, for me the last topic I have is the proposals for reorganiza-
tion  of  UTCs  or  organizing  them  differently.  We  have  already  ad-
dressed the splits for funding matches, and we might return to that
at  a  different  moment  in  time  as  we  get  closer  to  reauthorization,
but there has been some discussion on a competitive process versus
whatever  you  would  call  the  process  that  we  currently  have.  It  oc-
curs to me that we have 50 centers, we have 50 states. That could
be a coincidence, but, you know, I know that coincidences do occur.
I just haven’t seen one in Washington yet.

But  to  the  extent  that  any  of  you  would  like  to  address  the—
what it would look like to have a competitive system for UTCs and
awards,  what  the  criteria  would  be,  I  would  like  to  hear  your—I
would like to have your input on that topic.

Mr. BRUBAKER. Mr. Chair, I don’t mean to—I am very, I hate to
say  this  in  this  way,  but  I  can’t  think  of  a  better  way  to  say  it.  I
am passionately indifferent to whether they are competitive or not.
I  have  seen  ones  that  have  been  competitively  awarded.  I  have
seen ones that are earmarked, and both to a large extent are effec-
tive.  There  are  a  handful  that  may  need  some  help  on  both  sides
of  that  equation,  you  know,  so  I,  frankly—it  is  not  one  of  my—the
recommendations that I am passionate about in any way, shape, or
form.

So  I  just  think,  you  know,  not  that  I  want  to  say  don’t  rock  the
boat on this thing, but it seems to be, the system seems to be work-
ing  reasonably  well.  I  am  a  big  proponent  of  competition.  I  love
competition  in  contracting  and  you  know,  everything  else,  but  the
reality  is  I  think  we  have  struck  this  delicate  balance,  and  it  is
probably  best  not  to  expand  or  contract  in  terms  of  the  number  of
centers;  contract  because  I  don’t  think  you  want  to  deal  with,  I
don’t  think  anybody  wants  to  deal  with  the  political  fallout  that  is
a  grim  reality  of  this  situation.  But  at  the  same  time  I  am  more
focused  on  what  can  you  do  to  make  whether  they  are  earmarked
or competitive more effective.

Chair  WU.  Well,  I  was  not  aware  that  this  issue  existed  until
fairly  recently,  and  I  guess  I  am  trying  to  decide,  Mr.  Skinner,
whether I should be passionately indifferent or, you know, passion-
ately care about this.

you next.

Since  you  all  have  had  some  recommendations,  let  us  hear  from

Mr.  SKINNER.  Yeah.  I  think  on  this  topic,  and  I  think  I  am  on
firm  ground  in  saying  that  throughout  the  work  of  the  National
Academies, that we consistently come down on the side of competi-
tion and merit review as one of the hallmarks of quality control in
scientific research.

Now, does that mean that someone can’t do excellent work at an
earmarked center? No, of course not. And the program is fairly ma-
ture now, so that it is conceivable that the current portfolio of cen-
ters is better than the ones that we had 15 years ago.

But I do think that if one did want to open up a purely competi-
tive  environment  and  restructure  the  program  in  that  manner,  I
think  there  would  be  this  question  that  Dr.  Deakin  alluded  to—is
the dual purpose of the program; research on the one hand but also
attracting  young,  talented  professionals  into  the  field  and  giving
them a good educational experience.

And  that—it  is  not  that  you  can’t  do  both  of  those  things,  and
probably there are many people in this room that were in programs
that  did  both,  but  I  think  it  would  require  some  thought.  Because
there  are  other  ways  to  provide  support  for  graduate  students  be-
sides  University  Transportation  Centers  programs.  And  so  that
would have to be considered if we were starting from scratch.

Dr.  DEAKIN.  I  would  say  that  the  centers  actually  started  out  as
a  competitive  program  in  the  first  round  in  1987.  Unfortunately,
the  competition  was  organized  by  federal  region,  and  transpor-

76

tation  excellence  isn’t  necessarily  distributed  evenly  by  federal  re-
gion,  and  so  that  wasn’t  purely  competitive  in  the  way  I  would
think you would want to organize it.

If  you  look  at  the  earmarked  centers,  they  are  a  very  mixed
group.  Some  of  them  are  top  research  universities.  Two  that  come
to  mind  immediately  are  Northwestern  and  Minnesota,  either  of
whom  would  be  able  to  compete  very  effectively  for  research  dol-
lars.  Some  of  them  are  much  more  modest,  local  teching  colleges
that  are  not  known  particularly  for  research,  and  their  research  is
modest,  and  I  would  actually  leave  it  to  their  own  State  and  local
people  to  tell  us  whether  they  are  producing  the  people  that  they
need, because I see those as workforce development investments for
those centers.

And  I  think  RITA  has  encouraged  that  aspect  of  it,  that  they
really try to make sure that they are measuring whether their peo-
ple are ending up going into transportation jobs and being produc-
tive  in  those  jobs.  So  looking  at  that  dual  role,  that  has  certainly
been an issue in this business.

One  thing  that  I’ve  thought  about  that  might  be  a  way  to  man-
age  this  process,  I  believe  in  competition.  I  think  competition
sharpens  everybody  up,  makes  us  all  work  harder,  think  harder,
try to get creative. It is good to get a push, so I don’t mind having
to  compete.  I  think  it  is  actually  good  for  us,  and  if  we  got  our
comeuppance,  I  think  it  probably  would  teach  us  a  lesson.  So  we
would do better the next time. So I support competition.

One  strategy  that  has  been  discussed  and  has  operated  in  the
past  has  been  you  got  an  earmark  but  then  after  a  few  years  you
are  expected  to  compete,  and  there  won’t  be  as  many  centers  as
there  are  competitors  or  maybe  new  people  can  come  in  and  com-
pete as well. And I think that has actually worked pretty well, be-
cause  it  is  removed  from  the  process  some  centers  that  really
weren’t  able  to  be  productive  and  let  other  people  who  might  not
have  either  the  political  connections  or  the  famous  professors
yet——

Chair WU. Uh-huh.
Dr.  DEAKIN.—to  get  into  that  process,  and  some  of  those  centers
have  really  developed  and  become  good  research  centers  frankly,
so—from  the  earmarked  center.  So  I  think  we  have  seen  the  ear-
marks being productive in both producing people and producing re-
search  in  at  least  some  cases  that  would  be  competitive  on  any
ground.

So I would say go for a process that encourages competition peri-
odically after an initial period, even if there are earmarks, because
that  sharpens  everybody  back  up.  Let  those  centers  that  haven’t
been  able  to  get  their  act  together  and  perform  be  removed  from
the  process  in  a  rational  way,  and  let  other  people  take  a  chance
and say, we want to do this, we think we can, and go for it.

Mr.  BRUBAKER.  Yes.  I  just—if  I  can  add  one  additional  thing,
though, I want everybody to be really clear that the money that is
designated  for  the  UTC  Program  only  represents  a  portion  of  the
work  that  gets  done.  Obviously  you  have  got  the  match  issue,  but
frankly, most of the UTCs that I go to get, collect a lot of additional
money  from  Federal  Highway  Administration,  Federal  Transit  Ad-
ministration,  really  the  Department  of  Transportation,  as  well  as

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:26 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047544 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\T&I09\021209\47544 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

77

the private sector. They do privately-funded activity that builds on
that foundation, whether it is an earmarked UTC or a competitive
UTC.

So, I mean, they have sort of stood alone, for the most part they
kind of stand alone and have their transportation credibility, if you
will.  You  know,  they  are—and  I  think  that  is  a  relatively  positive
impact.

Now, there are other universities out there who are not UTCs at
all  who  get  millions  of  dollars  in  federal  money  from  the  Depart-
ment of Transportation. I will give you a prime, you know, Virginia
Tech  is  one,  for  example.  They  do  a  lot  of  great  research,  they  get
quite a lot of money from the Department of Transportation as well
as the private sector, and operate outside of the UTC Program. The
only  issue  that  I  have  got  with  that  is  I  don’t  have  the  same  visi-
bility  into  what  goes  on  there  as  I  do  in  the  UTC  Program  as
former RITA administrator.

Chair  WU.  Well,  as  we  look  at  this  issue  I  do  want  to  capture
the  strengths  of  competition  but  recognize  that  we  have  different
missions  to  perform,  whether  it  is  research  or  workforce  develop-
ment.

And  also  recognize  that  there  are  failed  or  imperfect  markets  or
competitive environments. In a country like ours it is hard to criti-
cize  competition  or  merit  review  unless  you  look  at  the  history  of
how some of these organizations or processes developed. And in the
development  of  the  science  establishment  after  World  War  II,  it
was dominated by a few institutions, and into the ’60s and ’70s the
peer  review  mechanism  shall  we  say  was  just  far  from  perfect,  be-
cause  people  knew  each  other.  People  knew  each  other’s  work,  so
even  in  a  blind  analysis  of  publications  or  grant  proposals,  you
knew whose proposals were coming through.

So,  you  know,  any  reconsideration  of  this  has  to  take  into  ac-
count  the  realities  of  whether  a  merit  review  truly  is  blind  or  not,
the multiplicity of functions ranging from personnel development to
applied  research  to  fundamental  research,  and  sort  of  the  shifting
centers,  the  foci  of  research,  you  know,  who  would  have  thought
that Wisconsin would be a biomedical research center 60 years ago.
I am not sure that anyone would have thought of that.

Those  things  need  to  be  taken  into  account  as  we  consider  this

going forward.

I  want  to  invite  any  of  you  who  have  any  closing  comments  to
make,  you  all  have  traveled  a  good  long  distance,  if  you  have  any-
thing else to add to this process overall, I would like to invite that
at this moment.

Mr.  Saenz—and  I  want  to  apologize  to  you  as  someone  whose
name  has  been  spelled  out  and  mispronounced  for  a  long  time
myself——

Mr. SAENZ. You pronounced it perfect.
Chair  WU.  Oh,  my  gosh.  You  are  very  generous.  Thank  you,  sir.

I think I have massacred it at least once or twice today.

Mr. SAENZ. Mr. Chair, I think just going back and just based on
our  prior  topic  about  earmarks  versus  competition,  we  at  Texas
thrive on competition. We think competition brings the best of both
the public sector and the private sector in trying to solve problems.

I  think  one  of  the  things  that  starts,  with  all  things,  especially
in  the  research  program,  is  we  need  to  have  a  national  plan.  This
national  plan  can  be  there  to  solve  for,  not  highway  solutions  or
rail solutions or public transportation, but we need to look at it as
a whole to try to identify how we solve those transportation issues.
And  it  may  be  a  rail  project,  it  may  be  a  highway  project  or  an
aviation  project,  inter-modal  system,  but  we  need  to  look  at  it  as
a whole, having that one focus, having that one goal, that one plan,
and  then  be  able  to  then  look  across  lines  and  also  at  the  same
time  be  able  to  figure  out  how  you  measure  success  will  lead  to  a
better program.

Chair WU. Terrific. Thank you very much.
If there is nothing else for the good—Mr. Brubaker.
Mr. BRUBAKER. Just briefly for the good of the order here. I, first
of all, I just want to commend you and the Ranking Minority Mem-
ber  for  your  leadership  on  this  issue.  I  think  this  is  really  critical,
and  like  I  said  in  the  opening,  represents  a  real  tipping  pointing
in  our  ability  to  transform  the  transportation  infrastructure  and
make it more flexible and responsive to our needs.

The one thing that, and you know this, this goes without saying,
and  I  don’t  want  to  minimize  the  complexity  of  this  issue,  but  at
the  same  time  I  have  been  in  Washington  long  enough  to  know
that when people use the word, complex, they really mean can’t be
done,  don’t  bother  doing  it,  don’t  bother  breaking  the  rice  bowls,
don’t bother breaking the stovepipes.

I  firmly  reject  that.  I  think  this  is  a  very  manageable  situation.
I  think  we  just  need  to  look  at  it  from  a  high  level.  I  think  Mr.
Saenz said it very well when he said, you know, we need that plan.
We need that holistic plan.

For  example,  you  know,  if  we  are  thinking  about  how  to  best
move  congestion  at  the  ports,  well,  if  you  give  that  project  to  the
Federal  Highway  Administration,  they  are  going  to  give  you  a
highway  answer.  You  give  it  to  Federal  Rail  Administration,  they
are going to give you a rail answer. But it needs to be some holistic
answer,  and  I  think  the  only  organization  within  the  Department
of  Transportation  that  has  the  ability  to  focus  multi-modally  and
holistically is, in fact, RITA.

Lastly, I would just be remiss and as an ex-staffer I always loved
to  do  this,  I  want  to  thank  Meghan  and  Mike  and  Travis  and  Vic-
toria  for  their  help  here,  and  as,  and  certainly  Shep,  and  Shep,  I
know  it  is  your  last  day.  We  are  really  going  to  miss  you  over  at
the  Department,  and  really  just  appreciated  your  service  here.  So
thank you.

Chair WU. You are good. You are good.
Anything else for the good of the order?
Well, I want to invite all of you to think—one topic I did not get
into  at  all  today,  and  it—we  will  save  this  for—as  a  topic  of  a  fu-
ture hearing, because it is a very big topic, and that is green trans-
portation,  green  infrastructure,  and  better  ways  to  plan  and  do
things so that we are cognizant of the footprint that we leave both
today  and  in  the  future  and  looking  at  our  inputs  as  well  as  out-
puts.

And  I  want  to  commend  that  set  of  considerations  to  you  all  be-
cause  I  know  that  many  of  you,  or  all  of  you  have  been  dedicated

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Paul  R.  Brubaker,  Former  Administrator,  Research  and  Innovative

Technology Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation

Questions submitted by Chair David Wu
Q1. You believe that a ‘‘holistic’’ approach to transportation research is needed. How
does  that  differ  from  the  current  approach?  What  are  the  barriers  that  keep  the
Department of Transportation from utilizing this holistic approach?

A1. The  current  approach  to  transportation  research  is  modal-centric  and  terri-
torial.  Research  budgets  are  based  on  overall  funding  levels  and  historical  funding
levels rather than actual need or value to the overall transportation enterprise. This
approach  needs  to  be  fundamentally  re-thought  and  the  approach  must  not  only  be
much  more  multi-modal  but  must  be  integrated  and  enterprise-wide.  That  is,  the
Department  should  be  approving  research  in  the  strategic  context  of  what  will  add
the  most  value  to  the  national  transportation  system.  Additionally,  some  portion  of
research should look to new and innovative approaches to transportation that do not
fit nicely into one of the traditional modal stovepipes. For example, there should be
a  robust  transportation-related  alternative  fuels  component  to  research  as  well  as
intermodal  and  multi-modal  modeling  and  simulation.  While  some  of  this  activity
exists within the modes today the activity is modal specific.

Fundamentally  the  barriers  that  exist  that  prevent  taking  this  holistic  approach
are  structural  and  cultural.  The  Department  is  organized  around  ‘‘modes’’  when  in
fact passengers and freight often use multiple modes to get from their origin to des-
tination. We need to think of passenger and freight movement more holistically and
begin to address challenges within the transportation system in this context. When
commuters  come  into  work  they  often  drive  or  take  a  bus  to  a  train  station,  board
a  train  then  may  take  a  bus  to  their  destination—involving  multiple  modes.  When
freight moves it often uses short sea shipping, rail and highways. Yet these multiple
modes are hopelessly stovepiped and do not focus on the most efficient way to move
people and freight in a holistic end-to-end manner.

This situation clarifies the notion that our national transportation system is really
a  system  of  systems  that  are  poorly  coordinated  and  are  consequently  not  as  effi-
cient  as  they  could  be.  There  are  also  Congressional  jurisdiction  issues  that  come
into  play.  For  example,  despite  the  fact  that  we  move  goods  and  people  using  mul-
tiple  modes—the  authorization  does  not  take  into  account  these  multiple  modes  in
an holistic manner. For example, if we could make tradeoffs between investment in
high  speed  rail  and  airport  investments  in  major  cities  it  could  result  in  obviating
the  need  for  building  more  airport  capacity  and  replacing  it  with  a  more  environ-
mentally  friendly  high  speed  rail  system—as  well  as  result  in  taking  a  number  of
vehicles  off  of  the  road  that  travel  between  city  pairs.  Yet  the  separate  authoriza-
tions  between  rail,  air  and  road  are  not  really  set  up  to  address  this  holistic  view.
Moreover, the tradition of using highway trust fund dollars to only support highway
projects  is  antiquated.  We  must  think  of  the  entire  transportation  enterprise—
whether it is the research program or the overall operation—much more holistically.
The lack of this holistic, system of systems approach has also resulted in missing
some major issues and has perhaps even stifled innovation. For example, the trans-
portation  system  is  dependent  on  a  cheap,  abundant  supply  of  energy.  When  the
price of gasoline and diesel fuel jumped up over the past summer—the Department
was  caught  completely  off  guard  and  unprepared.  Naturally,  vehicle  miles  traveled
plummeted  and  suddenly  congestion  was  reduced.  However  public  transit  ridership
increased  substantially  and  demand  for  Amtrak  seats  up  and  down  the  Northeast
corridor  was  at  capacity.  There  was  no  modeling  and  simulation  capability  within
the department to even understand or predict what would happen. The devastating
impact  this  situation  had  on  the  supply  chain  could  have  been  entirely  predictable
if research and information gathering activity was directed in a manner that better
understood the holistic condition of the passenger and freight movement system per-
formance  rather  than  focused  on  the  traditional  needs  and  narrow  interests  of  the
Department  under  its  current  modally  focused  research  and  information  gathering
structure.

Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. You say in your testimony, ‘‘currently, there is no systematic or focused program,
process, or set of activities that are driving innovations out of the laboratory and
onto our nation’s roads, rails, runways or waterways.’’ In your opinion, what are

the  current  mechanisms  for  uptake  of  new  transportation  innovations?  How
could these mechanisms be improved? Does this assessment hold true for innova-
tions in vehicle design and safety? If not, what are the differences between vehi-
cle and infrastructure improvements?

A1. The  Department  and  research  community  within  the  Department  specifically
has  discussed  technology  transfer  and  many  individuals  have  that  role  in  their  job
descriptions.  Additionally,  many  programs  within  the  department  like  the  Intel-
ligent  Transportation  Systems  Joint  Program  Office  are  required  to  consider  tech-
nology transfer as part of its mission. Within RITA the RD&T program has a tech-
nology transfer role and the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration and other modes have key roles in driving innovation into the transpor-
tation  system.  However  there  is  not  well  organized,  systematic,  enterprise-wide  ef-
fort to drive innovation out of the laboratory and into the transportation system.

If  you  were  to  ask  the  research  community  about  technology  transfer  they  would
suggest that the Transportation Research Board annual meeting represents a major
technology  transfer  activity  as  does  publishing  research  in  peer  reviewed  journals.
In my view, and this is based on a general familiarity with technology transfer and
commercialization  programs  in  major  universities,  research  institutions  and  states,
the  Department  and  transportation  community  does  not  do  a  very  good  job  of  driv-
ing  innovation  into  the  transportation  enterprise.  This  is  mostly  because  transpor-
tation  research  has  been  an  inside  game—one  that  is  managed  and  controlled  by
those with the biggest pockets who do not see anything wrong with the current sys-
tem or the pace of innovation deployment.

Given the Department’s almost $1.2 billion investment in research each year, and
by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  our  economy  requires  rapid  deployment  of  innovation  to
maintain  its  competitive  edge  in  an  increasingly  competitive  global  economy—this
somewhat  casual  approach  does  not  seem  to  make  sense.  Based  on  my  experience,
I  would  advocate  an  office  of  technology  transfer  and  commercialization  be  estab-
lished  within  the  Research  and  Innovative  Technology  Administration  that  is  ade-
quately  resourced  to  monitor  the  research  activity  of  the  department  and  highlight
the intellectual property that is being developed for opportunity to commercialize or
transfer  in  a  manner  that  would  further  the  state  of  research  in  a  particular  area.
You  asked  if  my  assessment  of  weak  mechanisms  for  uptake  of  new  technology
applies to vehicle design and safety innovation. The short answer is yes but not be-
cause the mechanisms don’t exist or don’t ultimately produce a result but rather be-
cause  they  are  slow,  excessively  bureaucratic  and  cumbersome.  To  be  sure,  the  Na-
tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) does a good job of collecting
data  and  statistics  to  support  their  recommendations—its  just  the  processes  they
employ  and  the  timelines  they  find  acceptable  are  inconsistent  with  technology  de-
velopment  cycles  and  tend  to  stifle  innovation  and  companies  who  desire  to  build,
test  and  deploy  safety-related  technologies.  For  example,  when  I  left  the  Depart-
ment we were still waiting for NHTSA to validate that certain communications tech-
nologies  were  appropriate  to  use  in  safety  applications.  This  is  important  work  to
be  sure—but  something  we  have  been  examining  for  the  last  four  plus  years  and
it  was  going  to  take  NHTSA  two  years  to  complete  its  study.  When  technology  im-
provement  cycles  follow  18  month  timeframes—it  is  difficult  to  see  how  these  proc-
esses can support timely and effective deployment of new safety technologies.

NHTSA  does  not  like  criticism.  To  be  sure,  they  have  presided  over  many  bene-
ficial  safety  regulations  and  requirements  and  there  are  people  alive  today  thanks
to  the  work  of  the  agency.  However,  there  is  room  for  improving  research  and  how
technology  transfer,  innovation  and  commercialization  in  the  vehicle  safety  area.
However,  any  constructive  criticism  or  attempt  to  influence  research  in  the  safety
area  generally  results  in  turf  warfare.  Any  attempt  outside  of  NHTSA  to  suggest
new  opportunities  or  processes  related  to  safety  generally  elicits  a  negative  reac-
tion—and  the  agency  is  great  at  working  the  office  of  the  Secretary—at  least  this
was  true  during  the  last  administration—so  that  any  criticism  was  met  with  the
suggestion that any change these processes or procedures will compromise the safe-
ty of the American people. In other words, criticize the process you criticize safety—
when  in  reality  these  processes—particularly  the  safety  benefit  validation  proc-
esses—could be significantly improved to expedite innovations into the field.

It  might  interest  you  to  know  that  NHTSA  carved  out  an  exemption  from  RITA
oversight  during  the  drafting  of  the  Mineta  Act.  The  argument,  as  I  understand  it,
was  that  the  safety  research  conducted  by  NHTSA  was  too  important  and  critical
to be subject to oversight by a centralized research oversight organization. Frankly,
this exemption speaks to desire and ability of the agency to insulate itself from criti-
cism,  oversight  and  review  by  hiding  behind  the  safety  mission.  Undoubtedly,  the
response  from  NHTSA  will  be  that  the  roads  are  the  safest  they  have  ever  been.

However, when more than 40,000 people die on the Nation’s road each year—rough-
ly the entire population of Grand Island, Nebraska—we should do whatever we can
do ensure that the latest safety technologies are deployed as quickly as possible.

Certainly  there  are  differences  in  vehicle  and  infrastructure  research  but  they
should not be artificially stovepiped as they both represent individual systems in the
holistic  system.  We  should  begin  looking  at  vehicles  and  infrastructure  in  a  more
integrated fashion—particularly with the development of next and future generation
intelligent  transportation  systems  when  the  vehicle  and  infrastructure  will  become
significantly  more  integrated.  Before  I  left,  we  launched  the  IntelliDrive  initiative
which  envisions  modern  sensor  and  communication  technologies  enabling  an  en-
tirely new safety paradigm that integrates vehicles with the infrastructure.
Q2. Do we need to produce a new, comprehensive strategy for our nation’s highways?
If  so,  should  this  strategy  include  other  transportation  modes?  Who  should  be
charged  with  developing  such  a  strategy  and  how  often  should  it  be  updated?
A2. We  do  need  a  comprehensive  strategy  for  not  only  out  nation’s  highways  but
an  integrated  strategy  for  the  entire  transportation  system—including  how  we  fuel
the transportation system. This comprehensive strategy—I have called it holistic but
I  mean  the  same  thing—should  include  all  of  the  modes  of  transportation—ships,
transit,  highways,  rail  and  air.  The  focus  of  the  strategy  should  be  on  how  both
freight and people move across the system with a keen understanding and data re-
garding system performance. This would help us better understand how people and
good really move across the country and where the bottlenecks and safety issues are
in the system.

This strategy should be fact-based and contain analysis, business cases and public
benefit business cases outlining how projects and programs will measurably improve
the  performance  and/or  safety  of  the  Nation’s  transportation  system.  This  will  re-
quire  a  robust  and  modernized  ability  to  collect,  analyze  and  disseminate  transpor-
tation-related data. Currently, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics—which is in-
side  of  RITA,  does  not  have  an  adequate  or  complete  picture  of  all  of  the  system
and  safety  performance  data  that  would  be  required  to  support  such  a  strategy—
mostly because it is grossly underfunded and does not have the data resources and
personnel that would be needed to develop such a comprehensive view and analysis
of the passenger and freight systems. In this same area, we also need to better un-
derstand how the system responds to externalities—like natural and man-made dis-
asters, changing fuel prices and unexpected events. The Department should have an
organic capability to conduct modeling and simulation around various policy, project
or event scenarios.

The National Transportation System Strategy should be developed collectively al-
though the Secretary of Transportation should be charged with developing the strat-
egy  and  putting  pen  to  paper.  Congress  could  and  should  propose  a  restructuring
of the Department along the lines suggested—although if nothing else could propose
a commission to study and recommend a new structure that better reflects the way
people and goods move across the country. I think this strategy should be developed
every  year  and  reflect  a  rolling  five  year  vision  of  where  we  are  going  with  the
transportation  system  in  this  country—that  lays  out  the  very  clear  priorities  of  the
Department  and  drives  investment  and  alignment  over  the  period.  When  I  was  at
RITA we put together a forward looking document called ‘‘Transportation Vision for
2030’’  which  from  a  thematic  perspective  could  provide  a  useful  construct—but  the
goals  should  be  bolder  and  the  strategy  should  provide  tactical  guidance  in  terms
of organizational alignment and budget formulation and execution.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Elizabeth  Deakin,  Professor  of  City  and  Regional  Planning;  Director,
University  of  California  Transportation  Center,  University  of  California,  Berke-
ley

Questions submitted by Chair David Wu
Q1. You  recommended  in  your  testimony  that  more  research  be  subject  to  ‘‘arms-
length’’  evaluations.  Could  you  describe  how  many  of  these  evaluations  are  cur-
rently done and how you believe they should be done? How would these evalua-
tion  processes  be  changed?  How  can  this  be  encouraged  either  by  the  DOT  or
by legislation?

A1. Arms-length  evaluations  of  research  are  important  for  credibility  and  can  help
target  research  dollars  on  the  most  cost-effective  and  creative  topics.  Independent
evaluators  can  be  asked  to  point  out  strengths  and  weaknesses  in  the  research  de-
sign,  comment  on  the  reasonableness  of  proposed  expenditures,  evaluate  the  quali-
fications  of  the  researchers  and  their  track  records,  estimate  the  contribution  that
the  research  is  likely  to  make,  and  identify  whether  the  proposed  research  is  inno-
vative or duplicates other past or ongoing research.

In  the  research  community,  peer  review  is  the  norm.  Journals  and  some  univer-
sity  transportation  centers  use  either  double-blind  or  confidential  reviews  and  the
reviewers are selected both for their subject area knowledge and for their ability to
provide  a  dispassionate  evaluation.  In  the  most  rigorously  organized  peer  reviews,
research  collaborators,  former  students  and  former  professors,  and  anyone  with  a
close  professional  or  financial  interest  in  the  outcome  are  disqualified  from  partici-
pating in a review.

Peer reviews are not perfect—for one thing, reviewers often know or can surmise
the  authors  and  vice  versa,  despite  the  removal  of  identifiers,  and  big  names  and
big institutions may sometimes be given deference that the proposal might not actu-
ally  deserve.  Despite  these  flaws,  most  researchers  agree  that  outside  peer  review
is  the  best  way  we  have  devised  for  obtaining  independent  evaluations  of  research
proposals and products and reducing biases in the evaluations.

On  the  other  hand,  there  is  also  a  desire  research  to  be  relevant  to  users,  espe-
cially  short-term,  applied  research  that  is  expected  to  lead  directly  to  a  deployable
product.  For  this  reason  reviews  by  outside  researchers  are  often  complemented  by
reviews  or  project  oversight  by  practitioners,  industrial  partners,  and  others  with
a  direct  interest  in  the  outcome.  Such  reviews  and  oversight  are  especially  helpful
in  raising  practical  questions  about  the  utility  of  a  product,  the  size  of  the  market
for it, competing products and their pros and cons, etc.

In  addition  to  peer  review  and  end-user  reviews,  strategies  for  obtaining  evalua-

tions that can be of value in guiding research programs include:

• Using independent expert panels to generate research topics, review research
proposals,  oversee  research  as  it  proceeds,  and  review  products.  (This  can  be
the same panel or different panels at each step.)
• Public  agency  and  industry  advisory  committees,  who  can  bring  user  and  re-
searcher viewpoints into the evaluation process while maintaining some intel-
lectual distance. Independence of the reviewers can be built into this process.
For example, some state DOTs enlist representatives of other state DOTs and
universities  outside  the  state  to  evaluate  their  research  programs  and  major
projects.  Because  panel  members  are  not  competing  for  the  grants,  they  are
more likely to be dispassionate than local reviewers might be.

NSF uses independent expert reviewers, and NAS committees evaluating research
and research needs are typically independent expert panels. NCHRP and TCRP use
stakeholder  review  panels  to  select  and  review  projects.  USDOT  also  uses  these
methods  for  some  of  its  programs,  but  also  does  many  reviews  internally,  in  some
cases because there’s a lack of resources to bring in outside reviewers. Many states
have research advisory committees, but for projects rely on internal staff review and
(sometimes)  project  advisory  committees  composed  of  likely  end  users.  The  Univer-
sity Transportation Centers program calls for peer review of research proposals and
products but does not provide much guidance on what qualifies as peer review.

Congress could mandate independent reviews by peers and end-users for all major
research  programs  (as  well  as  for  field  tests,  demonstration  projects,  and  other
major projects) and provide funding for such reviews as part of program costs.
Q2. Please  elaborate  on  your  comment  that  other  countries,  like  EU  countries,  Can-
ada, and Australia, are ahead of the U.S. in terms of developing a strategic out-

come based plan for transportation research. What strategic outcome metrics do
these  countries  use?  What  have  been  the  impediments  in  the  U.S.  to  utilizing  a
strategic  outcome  approach  and  what  can  the  U.S.  draw  on  the  experiences  of
these  other  countries  in  developing  its  own  national  strategic  transportation  re-
search plan?

A2. Transportation  research  would  benefit  from  a  mixed  portfolio  including  some
long-term, basic research whose application is uncertain as well as more applied re-
search  and  development—some  of  which  may  nevertheless  be  years  from  applica-
tion,  and  some  of  which  could  be  implemented  in  the  short-term  and  therefore
should  be  coordinated  with  transportation  plans  and  programs  in  order  to  move
R&D  results  into  implementation.  Partnerships  for  implementation  should  extend
not only to federal and State transportation agencies but also to the many other fed-
eral,  State  and  local  agencies,  businesses  and  industries  that  have  roles  in  imple-
mentation of transportation projects or products or are users of transportation prod-
ucts.

A  study  currently  underway  with  funding  from  the  Volvo  Educational  and  Re-
search  Foundation,  involving  researchers  from  Leeds  University  in  the  UK  as  well
as from UC–Berkeley, is examining the problem of moving research from studies to
actual  use  by  investigating  how  innovative  cities  and  regions  learn  about  innova-
tions. Preliminary findings are that loose networks of professional acquaintances are
a  principal  way  for  information  on  innovations  to  be  transmitted  among  end  users,
and that professional meetings and short articles in publications are more valuable
to  professionals  than  are  journals.  Further,  meetings  that  cross  disciplinary  bound-
aries  are  more  effective  in  transmitting  new  ideas  than  are  specialty  conferences,
which  are  better  at  developing  expertise  than  at  spreading  new  ideas.  Researchers
use  both  formal  journals  and  their  own  networks  to  learn  about  new  ideas  and  to
share them. The work suggests that an important way to speed up knowledge trans-
fer  is  to  encourage  participation  in  professional  activities,  especially  ones  that  can
attract participation from multiple disciplines and specialties.

In a related study just getting underway, UC–Berkeley researchers are looking at
ways  that  transportation,  urban  development,  and  environmental  agencies  and
foundations  select  and  evaluate  research  and  disseminate  research  findings.  While
the  study  is  just  getting  underway,  we  have  identified  several  good  examples  that
could  be  adopted  by  U.S.  transportation  agencies.  For  example,  Sweden  uses  inter-
national  panels  of  experts  to  help  evaluate  its  research  agendas,  assess  research
progress, and advise on action items.

A second study reviewing transportation policies in Canada, the UK, and Sweden,
conducted  by  the  Center  for  Global  Metropolitan  Studies  at  UC–Berkeley,  offer  ex-
amples  of  best  practices  in  prioritizing  projects,  including  research  projects.  The
general approach is as follows:

1) Adopt  national  goals  and  objectives,  along  with  performance  meas-
ures  which  track  accomplishments.  Typical  goals  for  transportation  are
improved  access,  efficient  movement,  economic  growth,  environmental  qual-
ity,  and  social  inclusion.  For  each  goal,  specific  performance  measures  are
identified and agencies must measure and report their achievements.

2) Require  horizontal  and  vertical  policy  integration:  National  transport
policies  are  required  to  be  coordinated  with  policies  for  other  infrastructure,
housing  and  urban  development  (both  urban  redevelopment  and  new  town
programs),  economic  development,  and  the  environment.  In  addition,  local
and  regional  policies  are  expected  to  be  consistent  with  national  policies.
Inter-departmental and inter-governmental coordination mechanisms includ-
ing  joint  committees  and  jointly  funded  programs  have  been  established  to
help  achieve  this  integration.  In  some  countries  policy  integration  is  also
being accomplished in part through institutional restructuring: Canada’s and
Sweden’s  national  transport  authorities  lie  within  broader  ministries,  the
Ministry  of  Transport,  Infrastructure  and  Communities  in  Canada  (created
in  2006)  and  the  Ministry  of  Enterprise,  Energy  and  Communications  in
Sweden.  The  UK  Department  for  Transport  (DfT)  is  a  stand-alone  ministry
but  transport  plans  must  align  with  the  umbrella  land  use  (spatial)  plans
at  the  local,  regional  and  national  level  and  local  transport  plans  are  re-
viewed  by  the  DfT  for  adherence  to  the  spatial  plans  and  the  DfT  Smarter
Choices campaign to lower carbon emissions.

3) Align  project  selection  criteria  to  national  goals.  Project  selection  cri-
teria  are  required  to  reflect  the  national  goals,  objectives,  and  performance
measures.

4) Provide  information  and  incentives  for  government  at  all  levels  as
well  as  citizens  and  businesses  to  support  and  help  meet  the  goals.
Funding  programs,  tax  policies,  and  pricing  strategies  have  been  revised  to
focus  on  achievement  of  national  goals  and  objectives.  Programs  have  been
funded  to  encourage  citizens  and  businesses  to  reduce  their  carbon  emis-
sions, for example. In the UK, nationally sponsored marketing programs are
also underway to let people know what they can do to reduce emissions.

5) Provide  funding  and  create  room  for  experimentation  with  innova-
tive  strategies.  For  example,  both  the  UK  and  Sweden  have  used  pricing
to  manage  congestion  in  their  largest  cities,  London  and  Stockholm;  in  the
Swedish case this experiment was led by the national government.

6) Encourage public-private partnerships. Canada recently established and
funded an Office of Public Private Partnerships as a component of the $33B
multi-year Infrastructure Plan.

While these steps are largely aimed at aligning investment programs and projects
with  national  goals,  research  agendas  have  been  developed  to  help  achieve  the  na-
tional  goals  and  are  being  funded.  In  the  U.S.,  such  research  agendas  have  some-
times  been  developed  (e.g.,  the  Transportation  environmental  research  program  re-
quested by Congress) but there has been less consistency in connecting research ex-
penditures to either the research agendas or to national policy directives.
Q3. If  UTCs  were  competitively  awarded,  what  are  the  criteria  that  should  be  used

in the award and evaluation process?

A3. RITA currently requires that University Transportation Centers report on their
products  in  research,  education,  human  resources,  and  tech  transfer.  The  specific
criteria are:

1) the number of projects selected for funding
2) the amount budgeted for those projects
3) the number of research reports published
4) the number of research reports presented at academic/professional meetings
5) the number of transportation courses offered
6) the number of students participating in transportation research projects
7) the number of transportation degree programs offered
8) the numbers of students enrolled in those programs,
9) the  number  of  transportation-related  masters  and  Ph.D.  degrees  awarded
10) the number of seminars, symposia, and other activities conducted for trans-

portation professionals and

11) the number of professionals participating in those events.

In  addition,  RITA  requires  centers  to  demonstrate  the  capacity  to  manage  the
grant  effectively,  both  in  terms  of  business  services  and  in  terms  of  a  Principal  In-
vestigator who can provide appropriate intellectual leadership.

These  are  straightforward  performance  criteria  that  can  be  used  to  evaluate  the
productivity  of  the  transportation  centers  or  the  capacity  of  prospective  centers  to
perform  well.  The  11  criteria  focus  on  inputs  and  outputs  and  hence  are  useful  in
measuring  productivity.  They  are  easily  and  objectively  measured.  Even  so,  the
meaning of the numbers—what value to place on a high or low result—still requires
interpretation.

In  addition,  university  transportation  centers  could  be  evaluated  based  on  out-

comes or accomplishments resulting from these activities, including:

1) extent to which research results have opened up new research directions, led
to new fields of study, and/or led to new or substantially improved practices.
including  systematic 
interdisciplinary  approaches  addressing  emerging
issues  in  science,  technology  and  multi-agency,  multi-jurisdictional,  and/or
public-private partnerships to improve implementation of research results

2) percent  of  graduates  in  last  five  or  10  years  who  are  practicing  in  the  field
of  transportation;  number  who  have  risen  to  leadership  positions  in  the
transportation field

3) extent to which professional practice has changed in notable ways as a result

of technical assistance and tech transfer activities.

These latter criteria are harder to measure and are more subject to interpretation.
However,  they  are  the  sorts  of  criteria  often  used  to  evaluate  quality  and  outcome

changes.  Independent  peer  review  panels  are  a  common  way  to  implement  evalua-
tions using such criteria.

Nascent  groups  would  be  placed  at  a  disadvantage  compared  to  long-established
centers  of  excellence  if  the  focus  is  primarily  on  accomplishments  and  resources  al-
ready  in  place,  and  so  it  may  be  useful  to  have  separate  criteria  for  new  centers,
such as the following:

1) a  minimum  of  three  regular/permanent  (tenured  or  tenure-track)  faculty
members  whose  teaching  and  research  is  primarily  in  the  field  of  transpor-
tation (or a university commitment to hire such faculty members during the
first two years of the grant)

2) a university commitment to offer at least one degree program with a formal,

university-approved specialization in transportation

3) transportation  research  funding  of  at  least  20  percent  of  the  amount  of  the
grant  on  average  over  the  past  three  years  or  a  commitment  of  matching
funds of at least 20 percent of the amount of the grant for the period of the
grant

4) evidence  of  current  or  proposed  collaboration  (extant  and  planned)  of  major
State,  regional  and/or  local  transportation  agencies  and  private  sector  orga-
nizations  with  an  interest  in  transportation,  as  evidenced  by  letters  of  sup-
port and commitments for matching funds.

These criteria would also be useful in sizing grants to institutional capacity.

Ouestions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. Your  testimony  suggests  that  one  reason  for  limited  adoption  of  transportation
technologies  may  be  a  lack  of  trust  in  the  assessments  that  are  available.  Can
you  describe  what  factors  limit  the  credibility  of  current  assessments  and  can
you  give  us  an  example  of  assessments,  perhaps  in  other  research  areas,  that
have been successful? What actions would be required for transportation officials
to restore their trust in these assessments?

A1. Trust in technology assessments, and more generally in assessments of the like-
ly  impacts  of  prospective  investments,  depends  in  large  part  on  how  accurate  past
assessments  have  been.  Many  studies  have  found  that  benefits  have  been  overesti-
mated and costs underestimated; the pattern of error is not random. Technology as-
sessments,  travel  demand  forecasts  and  cost  estimates  for  new  transportation  in-
vestments  (roads,  tunnels,  bridges,  rail  projects)  have  been  the  subject  of  consider-
able  study  in  recent  years,  and  scholars  such  as  Bent  Flyvbjerg  and  Daniel
Kahneman  (among  many  others)  have  examined  why  forecasts  and  other  prospec-
tive  assessments  are  inaccurate.  Kahneman  has  identified  psychological  factors
leading  to  ‘‘optimism  bias’’  whereas  Flyvbjerg  believes  that  there  is  considerable
‘‘strategic  misrepresentation.’’  Other  factors  including  unforeseen  changes  or  insta-
bilities  in  factor  prices  (e.g.,  fuel  price  fluctuations)  also  have  affected  the  accuracy
of forecasts, of course, but these factors have been found to be insufficient to explain
the gap between forecasts and results.

Strategies  that  have  been  recommended  for  overcoming  these  problems  include:
• Use  of  independent  peer  review  committees  as  evaluators.  For  example,  both
U.S. and EU universities call upon outside panels of experts to review univer-
sity  programs.  Some  transport  programs  in  the  EU  also  use  peer  reviews  of
this sort to take an independent look at the justification for proposed projects.
While  peer  reviews  are  not  perfect—especially  if  peers  are  drawn  from  a
‘‘club’’  of  associates—awareness  of  their  limitations  has  led  to  improvements
in  the  design  of  peer  review  teams,  often  by  including  international  experts,
experts drawn from industry, and experts from a variety of disciplines as part
of the assessment team: people with a bit more distance from the individuals
and agencies being reviewed.
• Scenario  testing  is  a  method  that  acknowledges  uncertainties  in  key  factors
that could shape future markets and opportunities. Scenario testing has been
used  in  the  U.S.  by  several  states  and  Metropolitan  Planning  Organizations
to assess alternative urban development and transportation investment pack-
ages  and  has  been  used  by  corporations  such  as  Shell  to  investigate  energy
futures  as  a  function  of,  among  other  things,  public  attitudes  toward  energy
conservation  and  the  environment.  The  development  of  the  scenarios  is  typi-
cally  done  with  multi-disciplinary  expert  panels,  and  in  public  settings,  with
public involvement.

tions in relatively quick, inexpensive ways.

• The  UK  Department  of  Transport  has  adopted  a  cost  estimation  procedure,
reference class forecasting, that accounts for ‘‘optimism bias uplift’’ by adjust-
ing  costs  upward  and/or  demand  forecasts  downward,  based  on  past  experi-
ence  with  similar  projects.  It  is  most  easily  applied  when  there  are  in  fact
similar  projects,  and  is  not  as  easy  to  apply  to  unique  projects  or  new  ideas
that have not been examined before.
• Focus  groups  are  used  to  test  consumer  responses  to  new  products  and  op-
• Other  market  research  techniques  that  can  help  assess  technologies  include
stated  preference  surveys  and  consumer  panels  that  participate  in  repeated
surveys  and/or  focus  groups  over  a  period  of  time,  sometimes  several  years.
• Demonstration  projects  and  field  tests  are  ways  to  further  test  markets  but
also  to  investigate  implementation  barriers  and  opportunities.  Demonstra-
tions and field tests often can be improved by including a wide range of stake-
holders in the design (so that all the factors that might affect implementation
are  included).  Third  party,  arms-length  evaluation  of  demonstration  projects
can  be  valuable  in  reducing  the  danger  of  optimism  bias  (a  risk  if  the  eval-
uators of the demonstration are also the proponents of the demonstration) or
too narrow a scope in the design and evaluation of the demos and field tests.
• Markets  can  offer  a  test  of  technology  readiness,  risks  and  opportunities:  is
there a business plan for implementation and are private investors interested
in the opportunities presented?

Q2. Do we need to produce a new, comprehensive strategy for our nation’s highways?
If  so,  should  this  strategy  include  other  transportation  modes?  Who  should  be
charged  with  developing  such  a  strategy  and  how  often  should  it  be  updated?
A2. I see several reasons for a new, comprehensive plan for the U.S. transportation
system that is multi-modal.

First,  we  need  to  find  an  effective  way  to  pay  for  the  transportation  system.  The
highway  trust  fund  is  depleted,  and  changes  in  vehicle  and  fuel  technologies  seem
likely  to  make  the  gas  tax  increasingly  problematic.  How  to  pay  for  both  urban/
metro  and  rural  highways  needs  to  be  considered  in  terms  of  emerging  energy  fu-
tures and technology options. In metropolitan areas, how to pay for transit services
also needs to be part of the discussion. New technologies can make paying for trans-
portation  fast,  efficient,  convenient,  private,  and  flexible,  and  multi-modal  applica-
tions could be made available.

Second,  we  need  to  pay  more  attention  to  freight  movements,  which  are  critical
to the economy but also have high impact on the Nation’s transport systems. Truck
and  rail  freight  systems  must  link  to  each  other  and  to  ports  and  airports  more  ef-
fectively.  Better  strategies  are  needed  to  manage  the  heavy  and  often  concentrated
traffic  impacts  that  result  from  international  trade  through  major  ports.  Freight
movements  are  inextricably  linked  to  security  concerns  and  technology  applications
and  better  planning  and  management  could  yield  major  improvements.  A  plan  to
pay for freight improvements equitably is also needed.

Third, there are promising opportunities to reduce costs and improve performance
by  implementing  new  technologies  for  applications  ranging  from  data  collection  to
user  fee  collection  to  improved  safety  and  security,  but  these  options  need  evalua-
tion in the context of ongoing investment programs and in comparison to more con-
ventional approaches.

Fourth,  we  might  be  able  to  have  better,  cheaper,  faster  transportation  services
for  both  passengers  and  freight  if  we  coordinate  across  modes  better.  For  example,
it’s increasingly important to discuss whether we should be investing in truckways,
moving more freight to rail, or finding new truck-rail combinations for freight move-
ments. Opportunities for better service at lower cost could result if we plan for and
coordinate  urban  transit,  conventional  passenger  rail,  and  (in  some  cases)  high
speed rail with air travel modes; rail could not only serve as an airport access mode
but could simultaneously serve a substitute for some short-haul air trips (as is hap-
pening in the Boston-Washington corridor), and a commute option in some markets.
MPOs  currently  prepare  transportation  plans  that  cover  highways  and  transit,
and  increasingly  address  freight  within  their  boundaries.  Some  states  also  have
been  developing  strategic  plans  covering  these  critical  topics.  It  would  be  timely  to
evaluate  the  performance  of  MPOs  under  the  new  responsibilities  given  them  since
ISTEA  ,  to  review  State  transport  policy,  planning,  and  investment  strategies  over
the same period, and to look at how well states and MPOs are coordinating invest-
ments and evaluating projects. Such a critical review and assessment could be done
in  one  to  two  years  if  mandated  by  Congress,  and  could  provide  valuable  informa-
tion  on  best  practices  and  needed  changes  in  practices.  The  resulting  information

would  be  extremely  valuable  in  shaping  a  new  strategic  plan  for  USDOT  and  the
Nation,  and  might  offer  new  ideas  on  how  to  restructure  categorical  grants,  create
incentives  for  cost-effective  and  high  benefit  investments,  and  make  better  use  of
new technologies in transportation.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Amadeo Saenz, Jr., Executive Director, Texas Department of Transpor-

tation

Questions submitted by Chair David Wu
Q1. In  your  testimony  you  described  the  benefits  from  the  first  Strategic  Highway

Research Program (SHRP). What benefits do you envision from SHRP–2?

A1. The  Texas  Department  of  Transportation  (TxDOT)  envisions  that  there  will  be
benefits  from  all  areas  (Safety,  Renewal,  Reliability,  and  Capacity)  of  the  SHRP–
2 Program. All are very significant issues in Texas and around the country. I under-
stand  that  an  Implementation  Committee  with  quite  a  few  ‘‘high  level’’  people  in-
volved  in  implementing  technologies  at  their  respective  agencies  has  been  estab-
lished. Although I am not an expert on the report, I am aware that a Transportation
Research  Board  Special  Report  296,  ‘‘Implementing  the  Results  of  the  Second  Stra-
tegic  Highway  Research  Program’’  has  been  published.  I  am  confident  that  Texas
and  the  rest  of  the  country  will  be  able  to  use  the  results  to  improve  safety  and
maximize the benefits of our transportation systems.
Q2. The  Texas  Department  of  Transportation  (TxDOT)  sets  aside  funds  for  imple-
mentation  of  its  research  projects.  Would  you  recommend  that  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment  consider  an  implementation  set-aside  for  transportation  R&D  projects
as well?

A2. TxDOT  recommends  that  the  Federal  Government  consider  an  implementation
set-aside  for  transportation  R&D  projects.  This  set-aside  could  be  used  specifically
for  actual  ‘‘demonstration  projects’’  around  the  country.  This  would  enable  it  to  be
used  for  activities  such  as  training  while  capturing  the  additional  costs  associated
with  implementing  new  technologies.  It  is  also  necessary  to  provide  assistance  as
needed  and  preparing  implementation  documents  to  maximize  the  R&D  findings.
Since a lot of money is spent on research, it is only responsible that we pursue cost
effective implementation.
Q2a. What percentage of the TxDOT R&D budget goes towards implementation and
do  you  find  that  this  is  sufficient  to  fully  implement  all  successful  research
projects?

A2a. Roughly 15–20 percent of the TxDOT R&D budget is allocated towards specific
implementation  projects.  We  follow  up  only  a  small  percentage  of  completed  re-
search  projects  with  an  implementation  project  since  many  do  not  require  one.  Im-
plementation can consist of activities such as adopting a specification or new stand-
ard  and  incorporating  recommendations  into  our  operating  procedures  as  appro-
priate.  I  feel  the  budget  set  aside  specifically  for  the  TxDOT  implementation  pro-
gram  is  sufficient  because  we  incorporate  that  into  the  R&D  project.  Many  times
the issues are overcoming other obstacles such as staffing and the time and training
requirement  to  prepare  for  a  new  technology.  This  is  ‘‘new’’  and  most  of  our  staff
is already extremely busy dealing with issues of the day and week.
Q2b. Also,  in  your  experience,  what  is  required  for  successful  implementation  of

R&D?

A2b. Successful  implementation  of  research  begins  with  conducting  excellent  re-
search  projects  applicable  to  TxDOT.  Most  of  our  investment  is  applied  research,
meaning  we  have  a  specific  problem  we  are  trying  to  resolve.  As  TxDOT  considers
implementation  of  research  results,  we  carefully  monitor  the  research  throughout
the  entire  life  of  the  project.  We  set  up  the  project  to  receive  deliverables  needed.
For example, if you need a specification, set up a specification as an actual required
deliverable.

Deliverables  should  be  provided  in  ready  to  use  formats  to  increase  the  chance
of  successful  implementation.  Training  may  also  be  necessary  for  employees  that
will have to implement a new technology. Perhaps, one of the most important things
we  discovered  is  the  agency  has  to  ‘‘own’’  and  ‘‘champion’’  the  research.  Within
TxDOT,  for  example,  the  Division  responsible  for  the  research  results  would  then
have  to  incorporate  them  into  their  standards  and  operating  procedures  as  appro-
priate.  Of  course,  we  need  to  have  the  people  and  resources  to  make  this  happen,
which is one of the obstacles I addressed in my testimony.
Q3. In  your  testimony,  you  noted  that  the  USDOT  could  help  states,  locals,  and
counties  implement  the  results  of  research  more  quickly  and  effectively  if  infor-

92

mation  and  requirements  for  the  new  technologies  were  provided  in  a  ready-to-
use format. What do you mean by ready-to-use format?

A3. Ready-to-use format would mean an actual specification or standard that could
easily  be  adopted  by  State  and  local  agencies.  Another  example  would  be  to  dis-
tribute  something  similar  to  our  Project  Summary  Reports  (sample  attached)  with
completed federal research projects.
Q3a. What  information  do  state  and  local  transportation  officials  need  for  imple-

mentation?

A3a. We  believe  that  what  would  help  State  and  local  transportation  officials  with
implementation is to make readily available a brief synopsis of completed research.
For example, our Project Summary Reports are limited to two pages and include in-
formation  about  the  following:  (1)  Background,  (2)  Research  (3)  Findings  and  (4)
Conclusions.  This  makes  it  much  easier  to  determine  how  they  might  use  the  re-
search  results.  We  also  provide  for  our  entire  agency  and  local  communities  all  of
our Project Summary Reports on the Internet.
Q3b. Why  do  you  think  the  DOT  does  not  already  provide  this  type  of  information?
A3b. The DOT does make this type of information available on some of the projects.
It  just  does  not  appear  to  be  a  consistent  practice.  We  are  simply  advocating  the
DOT have more consistent practices in Research and Development in order to have
the findings available for the State and local communities.
Q3c. Can  you  provide  some  specific  examples  where  the  lack  of  usable  information

slowed the deployment of new technologies?

A3c. While I do not have any specific examples of lack of usable information slowing
down the deployment of new technologies, there are research results from the DOT
and  other  states  that  we  have  not  implemented  simply  because  we  were  not  aware
of  the  results  and  their  utilization.  This  responsibility  of  course  rests  on  the  State
and  federal  DOTs,  lack  of  communication  both  ways  can  be  improved.  We  need  to
do  a  better  job  of  ‘‘scanning’’  the  provided  information,  web  pages  and  newsletters
from TRB, RITA, FHWA, etc. While USDOT needs to do a better job of distributing
information to the right State and local people.
Q4. You  mentioned  that  there  was  resistance  by  contractors  towards  new  tech-
nologies. What types of incentives or aid did TxDOT use where TxDOT was able
to  convince  contractors  to  use  new  technologies?  Do  you  think  a  similar  model
would be successful at the federal level?

A4. We can classify incentives or aids that TxDOT has used to convince contractors
to  implement  new  technologies  and  requirements  into  the  following  categories:
bonus/penalty  in  specifications,  measuring  performance-related  characteristics  and
giving  contractors  flexibility  to  achieve  them,  provide  tools  to  allow  contractors  to
lower  their  costs,  and  implement  new  quality  monitoring  programs  to  reduce  im-
pact.  All  of  these  strategies  include  education  and  cooperation  with  the  contracting
industry.  There  would  be  a  significant  advantage  if  a  similar  model  would  be  used
on a federal level. See specific examples below for benefits at a national level.

• Bonus or Penalty in specifications

Æ Development  and  implementation  of  Quality  Control/Quality  Assurance

Hot Mix Asphalt Concrete specifications.
When  we  implemented  QC/QA  Hot  Mix  Asphalt  Concrete  specifications
in the 1990’s, we included bonuses and penalties for mixture characteris-
tics that produce good performing hot mix. We require contractor testing
for  quality  control  and  TxDOT  testing  for  acceptance,  all  with  certified
technicians. We worked with the Texas Asphalt Pavement Association to
develop  certification  courses  to  insure  that  all  technicians,  both  con-
tractor and TxDOT, were certified to perform the required testing.

Æ Implementation of Ride Quality Specifications for Pavements.

TxDOT  conducted  research  to  develop  ride  quality  specifications  in  late
1980’s  and  early  1990’s.  Research  showed  that  the  public’s  top  interests
were  smooth  roads  and  safe  roads.  Implementation  of  the  current
iteration of the TxDOT ride specification includes bonuses and penalties,
giving  contractors  the  incentive  to  produce  smooth  pavements.  Addition-
ally,  specifications  require  certified  profilers  and  operators.  TxDOT
worked  the  Texas  Transportation  Institute  to  develop  and  operate  a  cer-
tification program for profilers and profiler operators.

• Measuring  performance-related  characteristics  and  giving  contrac-

tors flexibility to achieve them

Æ Implementation  of  HMA  specifications  to  address  aggregate  segregation,

thermal segregation, and joint density.
TxDOT  originally  developed  specifications  requiring  specific  pieces  of
equipment  (usually  costly  shuttle  buggies,  etc.)  to  address  these  issues.
These  were  met  with  resistance  on  the  part  of  contractors.  Resistance
was  reduced  when  we  implemented  testing  to  identify  the  problems,  but
allow  contractors  flexibility  to  develop  ‘‘fixes’’  on  their  own  without  re-
quiring specific pieces of equipment.

Æ ASR  Mitigation  Options  (Preventing  Alkali-Silica  Reaction  and  Delayed

Ettringite Formation in New Concrete)
Research enabled TxDOT to add an 8th mix design option and validated
the  previously  existing  seven  ASR  mitigation  options  in  our  concrete
specification.  It  has  been  successfully  implemented  by  giving  the  con-
tractor any of eight options for concrete mix designs to choose from. Their
choice is based on their local materials, experience, etc., and been widely
accepted  due  to  the  flexibility  given  to  the  contractor  combined  with  the
extensive training/awareness campaign that we undertook.

• Provide tools to allow contractors to lower their costs

Æ Low Coefficient of Thermal Expansion/Modulus of Elasticity.

Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement Standard with reduced steel
percentage  (to  address  horizontal  cracking  in  Portland  cement  concrete
pavements).  This  process  will  begin  to  be  used  on  projects  by  the  end  of
the summer of 2009. It will be presented to the contractor as a cost-sav-
ings  measure  to  utilize  if  the  materials  he  is  providing  for  the  concrete
pavement meet certain criteria.

• Implement new quality monitoring programs to reduce impact.

Æ Implementation  of  the  Superpave  Performance  Graded  Asphalt  Binder

specifications for use in all Hot Mix.
The  Superpave  Performance  Graded  Asphalt  Binder  Specifications,  a  re-
sult of the Strategic Highway Research Program (implemented by TxDOT
in 1997) involved a significant education and training program. We used
the  FHWA,  Asphalt  Institute,  Texas  Asphalt  Pavement  Association,  and
newly  formed  User/Producer  groups  to  educate  contractors,  asphalt  sup-
pliers,  and  TxDOT  personnel.  TxDOT  developed  a  new  binder  approval
program to address asphalt producers concerns that Performance Graded
Binder  testing  took  longer  to  complete.  We  now  approve  a  binder  sup-
plier’s  production  instead  of  individual  tanks  as  in  the  past.  We  give
monthly  approval  to  ship  product  and  perform  ‘‘check  sample’’  testing  at
least weekly to monitor production.

Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. How  are  the  research  needs  of  State  and  local  highway  decision-makers  trans-

mitted to federal research agencies?

A1. The main and perhaps most formal way that State and local research needs are
considered  is  through  the  various  Cooperative  Research  Programs  managed  by  the
Transportation Research Board (TRB). Each State DOT is afforded this opportunity
on  an  annual  basis.  At  least  some  of  the  various  TRB  technical  committees  collect
research  needs  from  their  committee  members,  who  are  from  both  State  and  local
agencies.  With  regards  to  transmitting  our  research  needs  to  the  Federal  Highway
Administration, we are not aware of a formal mechanism.
Q1a. Alternately,  how  are  the  results  of  research  performed  with  federal  funding

transmitted to these independent, local decision-makers?

A1a. All of our completed research reports are available on the Internet so if a local
agency  needs  information,  they  may  be  able  to  access  it  through  those  means.  The
larger  local  agencies  are  typically  more  in  tune  to  some  of  these  activities  so  it  is
easier for them. They are also fairly familiar with our specifications and standards.
The smaller local agencies have, of course, different needs. They would only be able
to apply results from a small number of our research projects. Our local TxDOT dis-

94

trict  employees  have  very  good  working  relationships  with  these  local  officials  and
often assist them with some of their technical questions and needs.
Q1b. Do the research projects themselves need to be changed to meet the needs of the
local  officials,  or  do  the  results  of  these  projects  simply  need  to  be  commu-
nicated more efficiently?

A1b. We  all  need  to  do  a  better  job  of  simply  communicating  the  results  more  effi-
ciently,  and  perhaps  more  importantly,  making  this  information  readily  available
and easy to find.
Q2. Do we need to produce a new, comprehensive strategy for our nation’s highways?
If  so,  should  this  strategy  include  other  transportation  modes?  Who  should  be
charged  with  developing  such  a  strategy  and  how  often  should  it  be  updated?
A2. Not  only  do  we  need  a  comprehensive  strategy  for  our  nation’s  highways,  we
desperately  need  a  national  transportation  plan.  This  national  plan  should  not  be
limited to the highways but should include all modes of transportation. We need to
do more than mandate processes, we need to establish goals and meet them. States
are looking for Congress to define a national strategy and provide the policy frame-
work  that  empowers  states  to  set  these  goals,  make  decisions,  and  deliver  projects
that implement the national strategy.

Transportation  legislation  should  be  consumer-focused  and  recognize  that  Ameri-
cans expect congestion relief, cleaner air, improved economic opportunity, well main-
tained  roads,  and  increased  safety.  Transportation  systems  should  be  evaluated
based  on  improvements  in  performance  standards  and  predictable  travel  times.
Processes mandated by law should be streamlined and harmonized to enable the de-
livery  of  new  transportation  systems,  not  arrest  their  development.  The  national
strategy  should  be  reviewed  every  few  years  to  make  sure  it  is  still  viable  and  not
just a place holder for transportation policy.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Robert  E.  Skinner,  Jr.,  Executive  Director,  Transportation  Research

Board of the National Academies

Questions submitted by Chair David Wu
Q1. TRB  will  be  issuing  recommendations  regarding  research  on  climate  change

mitigation and adaptation.

A1. The  TRB  Executive  Committee  has  been  proactive  about  addressing  transpor-
tation’s role in climate change for some time. A self-initiated study in 1997 was de-
signed to raise awareness about highway transportation’s large and growing role in
GHG emissions and to begin debate about mitigation options.1 Another self-initiated
study completed in early 2008 addressed the potential impacts of climate change on
transportation; it includes recommendations for important initiatives, research, and
standards revisions to facilitate adaptation.2
Q1a. What has prompted this new approach?
A1a. In reviewing the proposals being developed for surface transportation research
last  summer,  the  Executive  Committee  noted  the  absence  of  proposals  addressing
climate change mitigation and adaptation. Hence, it initiated a fast-track project to
develop research program proposals for Congress to consider. The first drafts of the
background papers commissioned for that project have been shared with your staff.
This  study  is  being  conducted  by  a  committee  of  experts,  who  will  use  the  revised
drafts of these papers, other relevant materials, and their own experience and judg-
ment  to  develop  their  findings  and  recommendations.  The  report  is  expected  to  be
complete in the August–September 2009 time frame.
Q1b. How much has FHWA spent to date on climate change issues?
A1b. FHWA provided an estimate that they have invested about $6 million over the
FY  1999  to  FY  2006  time  period  on  planning  and  environmental  research  directly
related to climate change. The USDOT total share of the Federal Government-wide
Global  Change  Research  Program  for  2007  to  2009  has  ranged  between  $0.7  and
$1.9 million, most of which is attributable to aviation research by the Federal Avia-
tion Administration.3 Focusing only on FHWA R&D expenditures specific to climate
change,  however,  is  misleading.  Important  areas  of  ongoing  research  at  FHWA  are
directly related to strategies for mitigating transportation greenhouse gases. For ex-
ample,  the  results  of  ongoing  traffic  operations  research,  including  ITS,  to  reduce
congestion;  programs  to  encourage  and  evaluate  road  pricing  strategies;  and  im-
provements to regional travel and land use models will be quite helpful in informing
future policy choices and operational strategies. FHWA research related to adaption
will  also  be  valuable.  It  has  been  investing  in  bridge  hydraulics  research  to  better
understand  and  predict  hazards  from  bridge  scour,  which  may  become  more  of  a
problem in areas that become more prone to flooding in the future.
Q2. TRB  recommended  that  University  Transportation  Centers  should  be  competi-
tively  awarded.  What  specific  evaluation  criteria  does  TRB  suggest  be  used  to
evaluate and define a successful UTC?

A2. TRB  has  been  involved  in  the  UTC  program  since  its  inception,  most  directly
in its early years. The Board convened peer review panels to assist USDOT in eval-
uating  the  initial  applications  of  university  consortia  in  the  late  1980s,  and,  subse-
quently, to review the third and fourth year program plans of the centers. In 1993,
TRB  issued  a  report  requested  by  USDOT  to  help  them  assess  the  quality  of  the
centers.4 Much of the advice in that report remains relevant, even though the UTC

program  has  grown  from  10  to  60  centers  and  expanded  its  focus  to  include  edu-
cation and training.5

The  committee  convened  to  prepare  Measuring  Quality  recommended  a  three-
tiered  review  process:  (a)  a  program-level  review  to  evaluate  the  collective  products
of  each  center,  (b)  a  center-level  review  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  individual
centers  and  (c)  a  project-level  review  to  assess  the  quality  of  individual  research
projects  and  courses.  The  committee  noted  that  measuring  quality  requires  making
subjective  judgments  about  the  value  of  programs  and  the  quality  of  products.  It
recommended reliance on review panels made of academicians and professionals free
of conflicts of interest. USDOT subsequently required regular peer review of UTCs.
The committee also recommended the development of quantitative measures of out-
put, such as the number of students supported by and graduated from UTC centers
and the number of articles and the number papers on UTC-supported research pub-
lished  in  peer-reviewed  journals,  conference  proceedings,  and  other  scholarly  publi-
cations.

In its assessment of highway research, including the UTC program, the Research
and  Technology  Coordinating  Committee  (RTCC)  noted  that  a  more  useful  output
measure  of  the  UTC  educational  mission  than  the  number  of  students  graduated
would  be  the  number  placed  in  transportation  agencies  and  firms.6 The  RTCC  also
reiterated the value of reporting on peer-reviewed publications of research supported
by  UTC  funds.  It  noted  that,  whereas  the  UTC  program  requires  that  centers  be
peer  reviewed,  these  reviews  are  not  shared  beyond  the  center.  RITA’s  UTC  pro-
gram  managers,  at  least,  should  have  access  to  such  reviews  as  a  basis  of  judging
the quality of the centers funded with federal aid.

The  intent  of  the  committee’s  second  question  implies  development  of  criteria  for
the  selection  of  UTCs  through  a  competitive  process.  Although  most  UTCs  are  not
selected  competitively  currently,  the  UTC  program  does  have  competitions  for  the
selection of the 20 Regional and Tier 1 centers. TRB has not been involved in these
competitions in recent years, so we are less familiar with current practice. Presum-
ably,  the  criteria  in  use  derive  from  the  goals  of  the  UTC  program  (multi-discipli-
nary  education;  human  resource  development  through  undergraduate  and  graduate
programs;  diversity  of  student  body  and  faculty;  center  process  for  research  selec-
tion;  ongoing  program  of  basic  and  applied  research;  and  technology  transfer).  Also
important  would  be  the  strength  of  the  UTC  proposed  strategic  plan  and  multi-
modal  focus.  Based  on  the  work  our  committees,  we  would  encourage  consideration
of  output  measures  such  as  the  success  in  placing  students  in  transportation  posi-
tions and track record of publishing peer-reviewed research, as well as the strength
of center advisory committees. We would also stress the role of merit review involv-
ing peers in awarding funds to UTCs through a competitive process.
Q3. TRB has consistently advocated that FHWA and DOT invest more in long-term,
advanced  research.  What  is  your  assessment  of  FHWA’s  Exploratory  Advanced
Research  Program?  Is  this  a  model  FHWA  should  follow?  What  lessons  can  be
learned from the program?

A3. The  RTCC  has,  indeed,  long  advocated  for  more  advanced  research  at  FHWA.
In  Special  Report  261  issued  in  2001,  the  RTCC  recommended  that  advanced  re-
search  represent  approximately  25  percent  of  FHWA’s  R&T  portfolio.7 SAFETEA–
LU  authorized  $14  million  annually  for  the  Exploratory  Advanced  Research  (EAR)
Program.  The  RTCC  has,  subsequently,  paid  close  attention  to  the  implementation
of this program. The committee is very pleased that Congress authorized and fund-
ed  the  program,  and  it  views  it  as  a  genuine  opportunity  to  expand  federal  invest-
ment in advanced highway research. The committee, however, is reserving judgment
about  whether  the  way  FHWA  has  chosen  to  administer  the  program  is  the  most
effective approach to advanced research for the highway field.8

The RTCC is pleased with the first round of research solicitations though a Broad
Area  Announcement  (BAA),  which  was  wide  open  to  good  ideas  from  across  the
spectrum of highway research topics. It is also pleased that last year’s technical cor-
rections  legislation  changed  the  local  matching  requirement  for  EAR  projects  from
50  to  20  percent.  In  its  2008  report,  The  Federal  Investment  in  Highway  Research,

5 Eight  centers  are  authorized  in  Title  III  of  SAFETEA–LU  (the  transit  title)  and  52  are  au-

thorized in Title V.

2006–2009,  the  RTCC  expressed  some  concern  about  the  narrowing  of  topics  in  the
second round of solicitations and the share of funding for advanced research projects
devoted to intramural research (23 percent of the funding allocated through 2008).9
Based on funds committed through 2008, the committee prefers that a larger share
of the funds be devoted to extramural research. (Subsequent projects may have been
selected  and  funded  by  the  program,  which  the  RTCC  has  not  yet  reviewed,  so  the
share to intramural may have declined.)

The  administration  and  conduct  of  an  advanced  research  program  is  something
new and exciting for the highway community, but it is one that will take some time
to  develop  and  mature.  Advanced  research  requires  a  different  approach  than  the
highway  research  community  is  accustomed  to  for  research  administration,  stake-
holder  involvement,  research  partnering,  requests  for  proposals,  contracting  (state-
ments of work, deliverables), merit review, and tolerance for risk of failure. FHWA,
and the highway research community more broadly, is learning about these features
as the EAR program proceeds. The good signs so far are a growing list of intriguing
and  promising  projects,  a  much  higher  proportion  of  research  conducted  by  univer-
sities than is true for the FHWA program in general, a new set of research partners
adept at advanced research, and FHWA’s outreach to scientists and experts in other
federal agencies to assist it in merit review. Because the highly applied, short-term
research model is so well established in the mind set of the highway research com-
munity,  signs  to  watch  out  for  are  whether  the  program  becomes  too  focused  on
near-term  deliverable  products  and  reliance  on  research  organizations  that  have
proven  track  records  in  applied  research  but  less  so  in  advanced  research.  The
RTCC  hopes  that  the  EAR  program  will  succeed  and  bring  new  understanding  and
breakthroughs, but it is premature to judge whether the program’s current approach
is the best model for the future.
Q4. TRB  emphasized  the  need  for  performance-based  metrics  for  transportation

R&D. Specifically, what should those metrics be?

A4. My  written  testimony  mentions  performance-based  metrics  only  in  the  context
of  the  administration  of  the  highway  program,  in  which  I  was  attempting  to  point
out the data issues that would arise from adoption of a performance-based highway
program,

‘‘Proposals already circulating that address reauthorization of the surface trans-
portation  program,  including  the  reports  of  both  SAFETEA–LU  commissions,
recommend that the federal aid program become performance based. A true sys-
tem of performance measures will create enormous new demand for better data
on  inventory  condition  and  value,  real-time  system  performance,  safety,  envi-
ronmental protection, and other performance metrics.’’

This  comment  was  meant  to  support  the  RTCC  report  recommendation  for  addi-

tional support for data collection.

TRB  has,  and  has  had,  committees  providing  peer  review  of  the  research  pro-
grams of FHWA, FTA, and FRA and for peer reviews of USDOT strategic planning
for research during the Bush and Clinton Administrations. From this experience, we
have  become  somewhat  circumspect  about  the  prospects  of  developing  and  imple-
menting  successful  empirical  performance  measures  of  research  and  development
outcomes. It is, of course, relatively easy to develop and implement output perform-
ance  measures  for  short-term,  highly  applied  research,  such  as  progress  against
milestones.  This  is  widely  done  in  both  government  and  industry  and  in  programs
managed by TRB, as described in more detail below. We strongly endorse, however,
the recommendation of a National Academy panel convened to address the question
of evaluating R&D in response to the Government Performance Results Act (GPRA),
‘‘The  most  effective  means  of  evaluating  federally  funded  research  programs  is
expert  review.  Expert  review—which  includes  quality  review,  relevance  review,
and  benchmarking—should  be  used  to  assess  both  basic  and  applied  research
programs.’’ 10

Our  committees  have  tended  to  be  circumspect  about  research  outcome  perform-
ance  measures  for  a  variety  of  reasons:  the  need  to  have  different  expectations
across  different  areas  of  research,  such  as  policy,  materials,  ITS,  safety;  the  long
lead-time for basic research results to find their way into products, technologies, and
practices; and the difficulty crediting individual research projects for outcomes influ-

enced  by  other  research  and  other  factors.  It  is  much  easier  to  measure  the  impact
of  a  materials  research  project  that  leads  to  a  new  specification  than  for  a  policy
research  project  that  leads  to  new  understanding  about  travel  behavior,  but  both
outputs  are  important  for  the  advancement  of  the  field.  As  a  result,  committees  of
the  National  Academies  have  tended  to  place  more  emphasis  on  getting  processes
right—appropriate  stakeholder  involvement,  merit  review,  and  peer  review  of  both
projects and programs that help ensure achievement of the desired outcomes.
Q4a. What  are  the  performance  metrics  TRB  uses  for  the  Strategic  Highway  Re-

search Program (SHRP), SHRP–2, and any other research that it funds?

A4a. Most  projects  undertaken  in  the  cooperative  research  programs,  the  original
SHRP, or SHRP–2 are expected to yield products that will find application in trans-
portation practice, consequently TRB relies upon review of the research it manages
at both the project and the program levels by committees that include practitioners
as  well  as  subject  matter  experts.  For  SHRP–2  and  the  cooperative  research  pro-
grams,  every  project  is  overseen  by  a  panel  of  researchers  and  practitioners.  Each
panel  prepares  requests  for  proposals,  conducts  a  merit  review  of  the  proposals  re-
ceived, and monitors the progress and outcomes of each project. We rely upon these
panels  for  quality  review  of  individual  projects.  Although  the  research  reports  pre-
pared  through  the  SHRP–2  and  cooperative  research  programs  appear  under  the
name  of  the  authors  of  the  research,  the  results  are  only  published  by  TRB  if  the
panels  so  recommend.  These  panel  determinations  are  based  upon  such  consider-
ations as whether the authors have been responsive to the statement of task of the
RFP  and  whether  the  quality  of  the  work  meets  standard  practice.  During  the
course  of  the  research,  the  contractors  are  required  to  report  to  the  panel  on
progress against milestones, including schedules.

At the program level, an ongoing review is provided by the committees that over-
see  the  research  programs  that  TRB  manages.  For  example,  the  National  Coopera-
tive Highway Research Program (NCHRP) is funded each year by the voluntary con-
tributions  of  each  member  state  of  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and
Transportation  Officials  (AASHTO).  The  projects  are  selected  by  AASHTO’s  Stand-
ing  Committee  on  Research  (SCOR),  which  also  makes  the  funding  allocation  deci-
sions. At the semi-annual meetings of SCOR, they are briefed on projects completed
and published, progress against milestones of individual projects, and other metrics,
including  implementation,  or  usage,  of  report  results  (see  Appendix  1).  NCHRP
tracks  the  adoption  of  AASHTO  standards,  specifications,  and  guidance  that  are
based on NCHRP research results.11 Also, the panels of completed projects are sur-
veyed every four years to find out about applications of the research they oversaw.12
In  addition,  TRB  monitors  the  diversity  of  contractors  selected.  In  2008,  NCHRP
was subject of a benchmarking analysis conducted by directors of State and FHWA
research programs.

The funding and governance models vary from NCHRP in the Transit and Airport
Cooperative  Research  Programs  (TCRP  and  ACRP),  because  Congress  authorizes
these  programs  and  appropriates  the  funds.  The  governance  of  the  programs,  how-
ever,  mirrors  that  of  the  NCHRP  program.  A  special  committee  of  the  American
Public  Transportation  Association  (APTA)  allocates  funds  and  picks  TCRP  projects
and  a  committee  appointed  by  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  provides  the  same
functions for ACRP. These governance committees also provide ongoing program re-
views.  As  does  NCHRP,  in  addition  to  reporting  on  program  and  project  statues,
TCRP  briefs  its  oversight  committee  on  products  adopted  by  APTA  members  and
others  (see  Appendix  1  for  examples)  and  reports  on  periodic  surveys  of  transit  in-
dustry users of TCRP reports.

The  Strategic  Highway  Research  Program  2  is  yet  a  different  model.  Although
AASHTO  supported  authorization  of  the  program  in  SAFETEA–LU,  and  the  states
agreed  to  fund  it  through  Title  I  as  a  percentage  take-down  of  their  federal  aid  for
capital  and  maintenance,  as  directed  by  Congress  the  oversight  committee  was  ap-
pointed by TRB’s administrative parent organization, the National Research Council
(NRC).  (The  NRC  is  the  operating  arm  of  the  National  Academies.)  This  oversight
committee is made up of representatives of State DOTs, researchers, environmental
and  safety  groups,  and  other  highway  research  stakeholders.  As  a  fairly  ‘‘young’’
program,  SHRP–2  has  few  products  to  review  to  date.  So  far,  the  oversight  com-
mittee  has  been  briefed  on  program  and  project  status.  Moreover,  in  authorizing

this program in SAFETEA–LU, Congress chose to have it evaluated by the Govern-
ment Accountability Office.

We  believe  that  the  determination  of  the  relevance  of  the  research  managed  by
TRB  is  built  into  the  structure  of  these  programs.  The  decisions  about  what  re-
search  to  conduct  is  made  by  the  oversight  committees  themselves.  The  relevance
of individual projects is further ensured by having panels that include practitioners
oversee  each  project.  In  research  programs  such  as  these,  another  important  meas-
ure of relevance is the ongoing satisfaction of the organizations that requested that
TRB manage the research in the first place. NCHRP, for example, has been in exist-
ence  for  over  40  years,  and  the  states  have  demonstrated  their  commitment  to  it
through  their  annual,  voluntary  contributions  to  fund  the  program.  In  all  these
years,  only  one  state  has  ever  opted  out,  and  it  did  so  for  only  one  year.  The  other
cooperative programs are much younger, and are funded through a different mecha-
nism, but both APTA and Airports Council International–North America (ACI–NA),
along with FTA and FAA, have demonstrated strong support.

In  response  to  a  follow  up  question  to  your  staff,  we  were  asked  to  indicate  how
TRB  decides  to  begin  or  terminate  research  projects.  As  indicated  above,  the  over-
sight  committees  of  the  cooperative  research  programs  and  SHRP–2  make  all  the
decisions  about  project  initiation.  Projects  are  occasionally  terminated  if  the  project
panel overseeing the project concludes that the contractor is not addressing the com-
mitments  made  in  the  agency’s  proposal  or  not  providing  quality  work.  In  the  case
of SHRP–2, contracts for higher-risk research generally contain ‘‘go/no go’’ gateways
which  require  the  researchers  to  formally  demonstrate  the  feasibility  and  or  the
utility  of  the  research  at  an  early  stage  in  order  to  receive  continued  funding.  The
decision to continue or terminate is made by the oversight committee.
Q5. How does TRB disseminate the results of the research it funds to standards de-

velopment organizations (SDOs)?

A5. As  described  above,  the  products  of  the  SHRP  and  cooperative  research  pro-
grams  are  expected  to  be  applied  in  transportation  practice.  Such  application,  how-
ever,  is  constrained  if  standards  that  agencies  can  reference  for  design  and  con-
tracting do not exist. Therefore, the volunteer expert groups overseeing projects en-
courage  the  research  contractors  to  deliver  materials  that  will  directly  enable  SDO
development  of  new  standards  or  the  revision  of  existing  standards.  For  example,
Superpave,  a  major  product  of  the  first  SHRP  now  in  use  throughout  North  Amer-
ica, is the systematic amalgamation of 26 different AASHTO standard specifications,
test  methods,  and  practices.  The  initial  data  used  for  development  of  these  stand-
ards was supplied by the original SHRP research teams. Similarly the Load Resist-
ance Factor Design (LRFD) guideline for bridge design adopted by AASHTO several
years  ago  was  preceded  by  a  series  of  NCHRP  projects  addressing  a  variety  of  dif-
ferent technical concerns of AASHTO’s subcommittee on bridges and structures. The
Mechanistic–Empirical  Design  guidelines  for  pavements,  which  has  been  endorsed
by  AASHTO  and  is  being  adopted  by  states,  was  developed  in  the  same  manner.
In  both  these  cases,  SCOR  embarked  on  a  deliberate  program  of  research  to  revise
and modernize these design guidelines. TCRP has also funded projects that have re-
sulted in transit standards, for example a TCRP project provided technical informa-
tion and resources that helped result in the adoption of many IEEE electric rail pas-
senger vehicle standards for system and subsystem interfaces.13 TCRP also provided
information to ASME that led to ASME standards on light-rail vehicle crash-worthi-
ness.

The cooperative programs often include members or liaisons from SDOs when con-
ducting  a  project  that  will  provide  information  that  may  be  of  use  to  the  SDO  that
has  responsibility  for  a  standard.  For  example,  NCHRP  panels  have  addressed
issues  such  as  traffic  signal  visibility  requirements  and  maintenance  practices  for
LED  traffic  signals,  and  have  involved  ITE  members  and  staff  in  doing  so  because
ITE is the SDO for traffic signal heads.

While  AASHTO,  APTA,  and  ACI–NA  have  strong  influence  in  selecting  TRB
projects,  other  organizations  also  develop  standards  applied  in  transportation.  To
ensure  these  organizations  also  have  access  to  TRB  information  that  supports
standards  development,  all  reports  of  the  Cooperative  Research  Programs  and
SHRP–2  are  posted  on  TRB’s  website  for  free  download.  Completed  reports  are  an-
nounced  in  TRB’s  weekly  e-Newsletter,  which  reaches  more  than  30,000  recipients.
TRB’s  Technical  Activities  Division  has  about  200  standing  committees  made  up
of 4,000 individual practitioners and researchers. This standing committee structure

functions  much  like  a  professional  society.  The  mission  of  the  standing  committees
is to bring practitioners and researchers together to identify research needs, stimu-
late  needed  research,  provide  input  on  research  priorities  and  procedures,  facilitate
the  adoption  of  appropriate  research  findings  into  practice,  and  provide  a  mecha-
nism  for  mutual  exchange  of  information  on  social,  economic,  and  technological  de-
velopments within transportation. The committees organize workshops, conferences,
and the sessions of TRB’s Annual Meeting, which attracts over 10,000 participants.
Many of the members of these committees serve on the standards committees of or-
ganizations  such  as  the  ITE,  American  Concrete  Institute,  AASHTO,  APTA,  IEEE,
ASME  and  similar  organizations.  The  TRB’s  Annual  Meeting  is  the  world’s  largest
meeting  designed  for  the  sharing  and  dissemination  of  research  information.  Much
of it finds its way into the hands of SDOs.

Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. Do we need to produce a new, comprehensive strategy for our nation’s highways?
If  so,  should  this  strategy  include  other  transportation  modes?  Who  should  be
charged  with  developing  such  a  strategy  and  how  often  should  it  be  updated?
A1. There  has  not  been  a  Transportation  Research  Board  (TRB)  report  addressing
Mr. Smith’s important questions. SAFETEA–LU did call for two major commissions
to provide guidance to Congress on the future of the highway program, particularly
with regard to how it should be funded. Both Commissions have prepared extensive
and  reports  to  Congress;  The  National  Surface  Transportation  Policy  and  Revenue
Commission  provides  recommendations  for  a  comprehensive,  multi-modal  strategy,
and  well  as  recommending  how  such  a  strategy  should  be  funded.1 The  National
Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission provides recommenda-
tions  regarding  funding  the  highway  program.2 Funding  issues  will  likely  be  para-
mount  in  Congressional  debates  about  reauthorizing  SAFETEA–LU,  which  expires
at  the  end  of  September  of  this  year,  as  the  authorized  funding  from  the  Highway
Trust Fund in 2008 and 2009 exceeds available user tax revenues.

If  a  TRB  committee  was  charged  to  address  Mr.  Smith’s  question  about  devel-
oping  a  new,  comprehensive  strategy  for  our  nation’s  highways,  it  would  need  to
consider  the  character  of  the  current  highway  program  and  whether  it  is  meeting
the  Nation’s  needs  as  currently  structured.  The  federal  highway  program  began  in
1916 with the first authorizing legislation and has been reauthorized and reshaped
from  time  to  time  over  the  last  nine  decades.  Although  the  program  has  evolved,
particularly  with  the  federal  emphasis  on  the  Interstate  program  in  the  middle  of
the last century, it has retained a federalist structure in which the Federal Govern-
ment  provides  a  share  of  the  cost  of  new  and  rehabilitated  highways,  while  the
states,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  metropolitan  areas,  make  the  decisions  about  where
and  how  funds  should  be  invested  to  serve  urban,  rural,  and  inter-city  passenger
and  freight  travel  demand.  The  states  are  also  primarily  responsible  for  mainte-
nance,  enforcement,  and  safety  and  develop  the  standards  by  which  highway  infra-
structure  is  designed,  constructed,  and  operated.  The  federal  program  is  a  user  fi-
nanced  system  that  is  almost  completely  funded  by  taxes  on  highway  gasoline  and
diesel  sales  and  through  commercial  vehicle  excise  taxes.  Authorizing  legislation
also pursues federal environmental, safety, equity, and mobility goals through provi-
sions  in  the  law;  moreover  the  law  provides  and  allows  for  expenditures  of  about
15–20 percent of all user taxes paid by motorists and motor carriers into the High-
way  Trust  Fund  for  investments  in  new  transit  capital.  As  noted  in  my  original
written  testimony,  the  federal  investment  in  highway  research  and  development  is
an absolutely critical component of the innovation process.

Because federal highway funding as currently structured operates something like
a block grant to the states, there is no comprehensively stated strategy per se, even
though  the  law  addresses  many  important  federal  goals  through  its  requirements
and program funding categories. For example, in addition to pursuing the goals list-
ed  above,  the  law  requires  and  helps  fund  metropolitan  planning  organizations  to
ensure  adequate  investment  in  highway  and  transit  programs  within  urbanized
areas. Thus, it is fair to say that whereas there is no single strategy for the current
program,  there  are  many  federal,  State,  and  metropolitan  transportation  and  envi-
ronmental strategies accomplished through current legislation.

I  provide  this  background  in  part  to  address  the  question  of  who  should  be
charged  with  developing  a  new,  comprehensive  strategy  and  how  often  it  should  be
updated.  Clearly  one  option  would  be  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation
(USDOT)  to  assume  a  leadership  role  in  any  such  an  endeavor  in  concert  with
states,  metropolitan  areas,  and  highway  and  transit  users.  The  USDOT  has  pre-
pared such policy guidance in the past in the form of major reports, often as a prel-
ude  to  reauthorization.3 The  commission  model  is  another  option.  Mr.  Smith  may
find  that  the  report  of  the  National  Surface  Transportation  Policy  and  Revenue
Commission provides the comprehensive strategy he seeks. Because the current pro-
gram  serves  so  many  goals  and  has  evolved  over  decades  to  balance  federal,  State,
metropolitan,  highway  and  transit  and  environmental  interests,  development  of  a
new  comprehensive  strategy  would  no  small  undertaking.  It  would  not  only  recon-
sider  transportation  goals,  it  would  have  to  include  reconsideration  the  current
intergovernmental  institutional  structure  for  carrying  out  current  highway  and
transit programs.

Mr.  Smith  also  asks  about  whether  a  strategy  should  be  multi-modal.  As  noted,
Congress has already incorporated transit into the highway program by taxing high-
way  users  to  pay  the  federal  share  for  new  transit  capital  investments  and  by  re-
quiring and funding comprehensive planning for urbanized areas. An open question
is whether other surface modes should be financed in this manner. We have not ad-
dressed inter-city passenger rail for some time, but in a 1991 report, our study com-
mittee  concluded  that  subsidies  for  high-speed  rail  could  be  justified  in  some  cor-
ridors,  but  progress  in  doing  so  was  stymied  by  lack  any  dedicated  mechanism  for
funding  these  subsidies.4 Current  highway  and  aviation  trust  fund  legislation  pre-
clude subsidies for inter-city rail.

Appendix: Examples of Usage of TCRP

and NCHRP Reports

TRANSIT COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM

• Transit  Capacity  and  Quality  of  Service  Manual:  TCRP  Project  A–15,
produced  a  First  Edition,  Transit  Capacity  and  Quality  of  Service  Manual,
that  was  initially  available  as  a  CD–ROM  and  on  the  TRB  website  as  TCRP
Web Document 6. In late 2003, TCRP Report 100, Transit Capacity and Qual-
ity of Service Manual: Second Edition was issued, updating and adding to the
material  provided  in  the  first  edition.  Report  100  is  a  fundamental  reference
document  for  public  transportation  practitioners  that  contains  quantitative
techniques  for  calculating  the  capacity  of  bus,  rail,  and  ferry  services,  and
transit stops, stations, and terminals. It also provides a framework for meas-
uring  transit  availability  and  quality  from  the  passenger  point  of  view.  TRB
established a Task Force on Transit Capacity and Quality of Service that will
manage  the  transit  manual  much  as  a  TRB  standing  committee  has  long
overseen revisions and expansions of the Highway Capacity Manual. The Uni-
versity  of  Arizona,  University  of  Idaho,  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Tech-
nology,  Portland  State  University,  and  the  Queensland  University  of  Tech-
nology all report incorporating the manual into transportation education pro-
grams. In addition, all Metropolitan Planning Organizations in Florida, at the
request of the Florida Department of Transportation, are assessing their tran-
sit  systems  using  the  quality  of  service  concepts  outlined  in  the  manual.
Transit  agencies  in  Atlanta,  Birmingham,  Broward  County  (FL),  DuPage
County (IL), San Antonio, New Orleans, Seattle, Washington (DC), San Fran-
cisco, MTA New York City Transit, Adelaide (Australia), and Dublin (Ireland)
also  report  using  the  manual  for  transit  planning  processes  and  quality  of
service evaluations. AC Transit in Oakland reports that its Board of Directors
is currently reviewing the quality of their services as they relate to the qual-
ity of service parameters in TCRP Report 100. The National Transit Institute
offers a course on the material in the manual.

The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) reports that it is using ma-
terial  from  TCRP  Report  100  in  a  new  textbook  that  they  are  developing,  ti-
tled  Professional  Transportation  Planner  (PTP)  Certification  Program  Re-
fresher Course Handbook.

• Transit  Vehicles  and  Maintenance:  TCRP  Report  29,  Closing  the  Knowl-
edge Gap for Transit Maintenance Employees: a Systems Approach, addresses
the  maintenance  skill  supply,  the  skill  needs  and  effective  training  methods.
It is very popular with maintenance personnel, because it is ‘‘down to Earth’’
and  squarely  addresses  the  technology,  diagnostic,  and  skill  development
issues mechanics are facing. The Transit Authority of River City in Louisville,
Kentucky,  has  given  copies  to  all  of  its  maintenance  personnel,  and  uses  the
report as a basis for staff meetings and maintenance services delivery. Pierce
Transit in Tacoma, Washington, also used the report as part of their mainte-
nance  team  concept.  It  provides  ideas  for  skills  utilization  and  performance
measurement  that  are  being  incorporated,  with  union  support,  into  skills-
based  career  ladders.  The  National  Transit  Institute  selected  Report  29  for
a  very  successful  teleconference  seminar  that  featured  prominent  mainte-
nance managers in a call-in radio format.

• TCRP Report 43, Understanding and Applying Advanced On-Board Bus Elec-
tronics,  is  being  used  by  Pierce  Transit  in  Tacoma,  Washington,  and  other
transit  agencies  to  give  staff  a  better  understanding  of  multiplex  wiring  and
intelligent  fleet  systems.  A  comment  received  on  the  APTA  TCRP  website
states,’’  this  is  a  great  report;  a  terrific  help  to  understanding  what  is  going
on,  written  at  the  level  of  the  intelligent  layman/engineer.’’  This  report  has
become a basic primer for bus on-board electronics.

• Pierce  Transit  also  reports  that  TCRP  Report  25,  Bus  Operator  Workstation
Evaluation  and  Design  Guidelines,  was  used  to  change  the  specifications  for
new  coaches.  Specifically,  they  ordered  smaller  steering  wheels  and  air-ride
seats  to  reduce  driver  fatigue.  Also,  a  major  North  American  bus  manufac-
turer advertises that its new driver workstation ‘‘is ergonomically designed to
meet  TCRP  recommendations,’’  indicating  that  Report  25  and  its  comprehen-
sive companion, Web Document 1, were used in the redesign of the bus.

• TCRP  Synthesis  2,  ‘‘Low-Floor  Transit  Buses,’’  described  the  technology  and
issues  associated  with  low-floor  transit  buses  as  of  January  1994.  TCRP  Re-
port  41  updates  information  on  the  current  market  for  low-floor  buses,  and
provides a summary of operating experiences on the basis of discussions with
transit agencies and low-floor bus manufacturers. Many transit systems have
used this material in their evaluations of low-floor vehicles for bus purchasing
decisions.

• TCRP  Projects  C–12,  Configuration  Options  Supplement  to  Standard  Pur-
chase  Specifications  for  Transit  Buses,  and  C–13,  30-Foot,  Heavy  Duty  Bus
Technical  Specifications  developed  standard  bus  specifications  for  different
types of heavy-duty transit buses using an industry consensus process admin-
istered by the American Public Transportation Administration (APTA). Speci-
fications were prepared for the following buses: (1) 35/40-foot, heavy-duty, die-
sel,  low-floor;  (2)  35/40-foot,  heavy-duty,  compressed  natural  gas,  low-floor;
and  (3)  30-foot,  heavy-duty,  diesel,  low-floor.  In  addition,  generic  specifica-
tions for the bus operator workstation and on-board bus electronics have been
completed,  and  incorporated  in  the  bus  specifications  described  above.  These
specifications  are  available  through  APTA.  Many  transit  systems  are  incor-
porating the standard specifications in their bus procurement processes.

• TCRP  Report  61,  Analyzing  the  Costs  of  Operating  Small  Transit  Vehicles,
provides a User’s Guide that explains an accompanying Small Transit Vehicle
Economics (STVe) computer-based model. STVe is a tool designed for transit
planners and others making decisions about the purchase of small transit ve-
hicles  for  different  services  and  operating  environments.  The  STVe  is  based
on  the  principles  of  engineering  economics  and  allows  the  user  to  assess
whether  it  makes  economic  sense  to  invest  in  a  particular  type  of  vehicle,
based  on  user-defined  inputs.  The  User’s  Guide  describes  how  to  run  the
model  and  interpret  the  results.  It  also  explores  non-financial  aspects  that
may  influence  the  vehicle  purchasing  decision.  A  number  of  transit  systems
have indicated the use of the report and its tool in their bus purchasing deci-
sions.

• Bus  Stop  Location/Design:  TCRP  Report  19,  Guidelines  for  the  Location
and  Design  of  Bus  Stops,  provides  guidelines  for  locating  and  designing  bus
stops  in  various  operating  environments.  The  Central  Contra  Costa  Transit
Authority  reports  that  it  uses  this  report  to  assist  them  in  making  rec-
ommendations for the location of bus stops to their member jurisdictions.

• Pedestrian  Safety:  TCRP/NCHRP  Report  112/562,  Improving  Pedestrian
Safety at Unsignalized Crossings was approved by the National Committee of
the MUTCD. As a result, the next version of the MUTCD will include changes
in the area of Pedestrian Beacon and Pedestrian Signal Warrant.

• Standardized  Railcar  Systems:  Transit  rail  operators  could  save  as  much
as $120 million as a result of the development of uniform technical standards
for rail vehicle systems and subsystems. Through TCRP Project G–4, an Insti-
tute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Rail Transit Vehicle Inter-
face  Standards  Committee  was  formed  as  part  of  the  standards-development
process.  The  Committee  formed  15  working  groups  to  prepare  standards  for
specific interfaces. In addition, an American Society of Mechanical Engineers
(ASME) Committee was formed to develop mechanical standards for railcars.
This  ASME  Committee  focused  on  the  structural  strength  and  crash-worthi-
ness  of  light  rail  and  rapid  transit  cars.  The  standards,  which  should  lower
the  cost  of  transit  railcars  and  replacement  parts,  reduce  parts  inventories,
and simplify maintenance, evolved through a consensus-building process. The
project  involved  significant  in-kind  contributions  by  the  transit  industry,
leveraging  the  TCRP  investment  by  a  ratio  of  approximately  eight  to  one.
Under  the  TCRP  project,  nine  standards  were  formally  published  by  the
IEEE,  and  a  number  of  others  were  in  various  stages  of  production  in  2002,
when the process was transitioned to APTA sponsorship. It has been reported
that  SEPTA  used  a  draft  version  of  a  standard  outlining  communications-
based  train  control  (CBTC)  performance  and  functional  requirements  in  its
CBTC  procurement  document  for  its  light  rail  tunnel.  The  MTA  NYCT  has
indicated  that  the  standards  have  helped  them  finalize  technical  specifica-
tions  for  the  procurement  of  more  than  2,000  new  subway  cars.  In  addition,
New  Jersey  Transit  reported  that  it  would  save  approximately  $420,000  per
year as a result of the use of the IEEE standard for communications protocols
aboard trains developed by this effort. To date, the standards have been cited

in specifications issued by the Chicago Transit Authority, Massachusetts Bay
Transportation  Authority,  MTA  Long  Island  Railroad,  MTA  New  York  City
Transit,  New  Jersey  Transit,  Washington  Metropolitan  Area  Transit  Author-
ity, and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. The Illinois
Department of Transportation also cited the standards in their positive train
control procurement project.

• Rail  Infrastructure  Research:  TCRP  Report  57,  Track  Design  Handbook
for  Light  Rail  Transit,  provides  guidelines  for  the  design  of  various  types  of
light rail transit track. Track structure types include ballasted, direct fixation
(‘‘ballastless’’),  and  embedded  track.  The  components  of  the  various  track
types  are  discussed  in  detail.  The  handbook  includes  chapters  on  vehicles,
alignment,  track  structures,  track  components,  special  track  work,  aerial
structures/bridges, corrosion control, noise and vibration, signals, and traction
power. These chapters provide insight into considerations that affect track de-
sign  and  require  interface  coordination.  A  consultant  reported  that  he  had
used the handbook on LRT design projects in Baltimore and Tampa. In addi-
tion,  the  Charlotte  Area  Transit  System  reported  that  it  used  the  report  to
review the design aspects of its planned light rail system as they were devel-
oped  by  the  system’s  consultants.  The  Denver  RTD  also  reported  that  the
handbook was used as the basis for designing its light rail extension. AREMA
Committee  12  is  currently  updating  Chapter  12  of  the  AREMA  track  stand-
ards for transit application. The committee is drawing heavily from TCRP Re-
port 57.

• Fare Structures, Systems, and Technologies: TCRP  Report  80,  A  Toolkit
for  Self-Service,  Barrier-Free  Fare  Collection,  addresses  the  full  range  of
issues  and  parameters  that  an  agency  must  consider  in  determining  the  ap-
plicability of self-service fare collection systems, including those related to pol-
icy  and  enforcement  issues,  operational  issues,  and  capital  and  equipment
issues.  The  Charlotte  Area  Transit  System  (CATS)  reports  that  this  TCRP
publication served as the centerpiece for recommendations associated with es-
tablishing regulations to address fare evaders, and other safety/security mat-
ters associated with operating the barrier-free fare collection system proposed
for their light rail system.

• Track  Sharing:  TCRP  Report  52,  Joint  Operation  of  Light  Rail  Transit  or
Diesel  Multiple  Unit  Vehicles  with  Railroads,  identifies  and  discusses  issues
associated  with  the  joint  operation  of  light  rail  transit  (LRT)  or  lightweight
diesel  multiple  unit  (DMU)  vehicles  with  freight  and/or  passenger  railroads.
For  the  purposes  of  this  report,  joint  operation  is  defined  as  co-mingled,  si-
multaneous  train  operation  on  shared  track  by  railroad  trains  (freight  and/
or  passenger)  and  rail  transit  vehicles  that  are  not  fully  compliant  with  cur-
rent Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations. The report identifies
and discusses issues associated with such joint operation, focusing on the cur-
rent  regulatory  and  institutional  environment,  railroad  and  rail  transit  oper-
ations,  infrastructure,  and  rolling  stock.  In  addition,  substantial  information
concerning  joint  operation  overseas  is  presented  and  discussed.  This  report
has been a primary source of information to assist in the debate on the issue
of track sharing in the United States.

• Public  Transportation  to  Airports:  TCRP  Report  62,  Improving  Public
Transportation  Access  to  Large  Airports,  presents  available  data  on  the  use
of  public  transportation  at  large  U.S.  airports  and  selected  international  air-
ports, as well as related evolving trends. The report provides examples of suc-
cessful airport access systems from around the world; presents key factors af-
fecting  the  use  of  public  transportation  by  airline  passengers  and  employees;
identifies  new  and  emerging  technologies  that  have  the  potential  to  improve
public transportation services at airports; and describes the institutional envi-
ronment and factors affecting public transportation at large U.S. airports, in-
cluding  airport  structure,  funding  for  airports,  and  agreements  with  airlines.
This report has been useful to several transit agencies investigating potential
rail links to airports in their service areas.

• Evaluating Fuel Options for Buses: TCRP Report 38, Guidebook for evalu-
ating,  Selecting  and  Implementing  Fuel  Choices  for  Transit  Bus  Operations
(C–8),  provides  information  on  the  performance,  cost,  safety,  and  facility  re-
quirements  of  five  transit  bus  fuels:  diesel  (baseline  for  comparison),  com-
pressed  natural  gas,  liquefied  natural  gas,  methanol,  ethanol  and  liquefied
petroleum  gas.  An  accompanying  cost  model  spreadsheet,  FuelCost  1.0,  en-

ables  users  to  estimate  and  compare  the  cost  impacts  of  fuel  choices.  VIA
Transit  in  San  Antonio  used  the  software  to  aid  them  in  selecting  an  alter-
native  fuel  and  in  justifying  the  decision  to  their  management  and  Board  of
Directors.

• Rural  Transit:  TCRP  Report  54,  Management  Toolkit  for  Rural  and  Small
Urban  Transportation  Systems,  identifies  an  array  of  management  principles
and  techniques,  for  use  by  small  urban  and  rural  public  transportation  pro-
viders,  to  assist  in  managing  their  transportation  services  more  effectively.
The toolkit has two parts: a guidebook and a self-assessment tool. The guide-
book introduces the idea of customer-driven transit service attributes and in-
cludes  general  management  philosophies.  Included  in  the  guidebook  are  ex-
emplary  practices  and  ‘‘how  to’’  instructions  for  some  topics.  Additional  sec-
tions  describing  ‘‘rules  of  thumb’’  or  ‘‘things  to  avoid’’  are  included  for  some
management processes. A self-assessment computer-based tool on disk accom-
panies  the  report.  The  tool  is  designed  to  give  the  user  a  baseline  or  current
picture of the status of the transit system. The West Virginia Division of Pub-
lic Transit distributed copies of this report to all of the rural operators in the
state  and  also  brought  in  the  consultant  who  produced  the  report  to  give  a
training session. The Division of Public Transit indicates that the report, and
its  accompanying  tool,  have  been  very  useful  to  the  rural  operators  in  West
Virginia.

• TCRP  Report  70,  Change  and  Innovation  at  Rural  and  Small  Urban
Transit  Systems,  addresses  the  culture  for  change  and  innovation,  and
presents  more  than  40  initiatives  and  innovations  implemented  by  an
array of organizations including public and nonprofit transit systems, re-
gional  planning  agencies,  State  transit  associations,  and  State  depart-
ments  of  transportation.  The  Southeast  Missouri  Transportation  Service
reports  that  the  report  ‘‘. . .  has  been  a  valuable  resource  in  improving
our service.’’ They have used the report to ‘‘. . . define our corporate cul-
ture,  and  focus  on  our  values,  attitudes  and  beliefs  for  the  process  of
change.’’  Also,  ‘‘. . .  this  report  has  challenged  us  to  be  the  best  we  can
be  and  view  challenges  as  opportunities  for  new  ways  of  doing  things.’’
• Bus Rapid Transit: TCRP Report 90, Bus Rapid Transit, a two-volume set,
identifies the potential range of bus rapid transit applications through 26 case
studies,  and  provides  planning  and  implementation  guidelines  for  bus  rapid
transit.  The  Charlotte  Area  Transit  System  reports  that  they  found  the  case
studies  in  Report  90,  Volume  1  very  helpful  as  they  were  preparing  informa-
tion on bus rapid transit to share with their board. The Fairfax County (Vir-
ginia) Department of Transportation reports that it has used Report 90 exten-
sively  in  the  planning  for  a  BRT  system  in  the  Richmond  Highway  corridor
of the county.

• TCRP Report 118, Bus Rapid Transit Practitioner’s Guide, provides infor-
mation  on  the  costs,  impacts,  and  effectiveness  of  implementing  selected
bus  rapid  transit  (BRT)  components.  It  includes  practical  information
that  can  be  readily  used  by  transit  professionals  and  policy-makers  in
planning  and  decision-making  related  to  implementing  different  compo-
nents  of  BRT  systems.  This  report  updates  some  of  the  information  pre-
sented in TCRP Report 90: Bus Rapid Transit and presents the latest de-
velopments  and  research  results  related  to  the  costs  and  impacts  of  im-
plementing  various  BRT  components  and  their  effectiveness.  The  Cali-
fornia  Department  of  Transportation  (CALTRANS)  indicated  that  they
use TCRP Report 118 as the basis for a course for CALTRANS personnel,
particularly  highway/traffic  engineers.  Purdue  University  notes  that  the
material in Report 118 is used in a course covering bus rapid transit.

• Transit  Operator  Fatigue:  TCRP  Report  81,  Toolkit  for  Transit  Operator
Fatigue,  documents  principles,  techniques,  and  strategies  that  can  be  used  in
the  development  of  fatigue-mitigation  plans.  The  Toolbox  includes  a  ‘‘how  to’’
component  on  the  design,  implementation,  and  evaluation  of  fatigue-mitiga-
tion plans. An accompanying CD–ROM provides specific tools, such as posters
for  operator  rooms,  that  address  fatigue  issues.  The  National  Transit  Insti-
tute  (NTI)  prepared  a  one-day  course  on  the  report,  and  offered  it  at  eight
locations  throughout  the  country  in  the  first  half  of  2003.  The  Santa  Clara
Valley  Regional  Transportation  Authority  (VTA)  in  San  Jose,  California  re-

• The Image of Transit: TCRP Report 63, Enhancing the Image and Visibility
of Transit in the United States and Canada, assists professionals at the local,
regional,  and  national  levels  interested  in  improving  the  visibility  and  image
of  transit  in  the  United  States  and  Canada  through  the  implementation  of
image campaigns. The report documents and presents how the image of tran-
sit  can  be  strengthened  by  building  on  existing  positive  perceptions.  The  re-
search  provides  a  communications  strategy  to  guide  national,  regional,  and
local  efforts  to  enhance  the  image  and  visibility  of  transit  in  order  to  create
a  more  positive  and  supportive  environment.  The  results  of  this  effort  are
being  used  in  APTA’s  Public  Transportation  Partnership  for  Tomorrow  (PT)2
program. It has also been reported that the results were used in the develop-
ment  of  marketing  campaigns  in  Arizona  and  Pennsylvania.  Funding  assist-
ance  for  the  Canadian  element  of  the  research  was  provided,  in  part,  by
Transport Canada through the Canadian Urban Transit Association.

• Professional  Capacity  Building:  Universities  and  State  departments  of
transportation have requested TCRP materials, and sometimes the author, in
support  of  training  courses.  The  New  York  State  Department  of  Transpor-
tation requested copies of TCRP Synthesis 22, Monitoring of Bus Maintenance
Performance, for use in state-level training. The Pennsylvania Transportation
Institute used copies of Measuring Customer Satisfaction and Service Quality:
A  Handbook  for  the  Transit  Industry  in  a  course  on  customer  service.  The
tools from that report were utilized in Pennsylvania. Minnesota DOT reported
that Synthesis 30, ADA Paratransit Eligibility Practices, was beneficial to the
DOT  staff  and  was  frequently  requested  by  transit  agencies  in  Minnesota.
The author of TCRP Synthesis 8, Retrofit of Buses to Meet Clean Air Regula-
tions, conducted six workshops on the subject at the request of agencies striv-
ing to comply with the complex regulations. He also conducted workshops for
Florida DOT based on Synthesis 12, Transit Bus Service Line Cleaning Func-
tions.

The Civil Engineering Department at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas
developed a graduate course in transportation using TCRP Reports 16, 27, 30,
33,  35,  36,  and  the  CD–ROM  on  Transit  Capacity  and  Quality  of  Service  as
source materials.

Rutgers  University  is  using  TCRP  Report  30,  Transit  Scheduling:  Basic
and Advanced Manuals, and TCRP Report 100, Transit Capacity and Quality
of  Service  Manual:  Second  Edition  in  a  course  entitled  Transit  Management
and Planning. The course is part of the Master’s program at Rutgers Univer-
sity Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy.

Two products are especially useful to travel demand forecasters:
—TCRP  Report  95,  Traveler  Response  to  Transportation  Systems  Changes:
Third  Edition  will  be  published  as  a  19-volume  report,  updating  a  hand-
book  last  published  in  1981.  This  handbook  will  equip  members  of  the
transportation profession with a comprehensive, readily accessible, interpre-
tive  documentation  of  results  and  experience  observed  across  the  United
States  and  elsewhere  of  traveler  responses  to  different  types  of  transpor-
tation  system  changes.  To  date,  the  first  thirteen  volumes  of  this  report
have  been  published—Chapter  2,  HOV  Facilities;  Chapter  3,  Park-and-
Ride/Pool; Chapter 5, Vanpools and Buspools; Chapter 6, Demand Respon-
sive/ADA;  Chapter  9,  Transit  Scheduling  and  Frequency;  Chapter  10,  Bus
Routing  and  Coverage;  Chapter  11,  Transit  Information  and  Promotion;
Chapter  12,  Transit  Pricing  and  Fares;  Chapter  13,  Parking  Pricing  and
Fees;  Chapter  14,  Road  Value  Pricing;  Chapter  15,  Land  Use  and  Site  De-
sign;  Chapter  17,  Transit  Oriented  Development;  and  Chapter  18,  Parking
Management and Supply. Remaining chapters will be published throughout
the  remainder  of  2008  as  they  become  available.  The  Metropolitan  Atlanta
Rapid Transit Authority reports that it used Chapter 11 in the development
of  its  2005  Marketing  Action  Plan.  Bloomington  (IN)  Transit  reports  using
Chapter  3  in  discussing  commuter  parking  lot  impacts  with  adjacent  com-
munity  groups.  The  University  of  Florida  reports  that  Chapter  15,  Land
Use and Site Design, has been incorporated in a course being offered.
—TCRP Report 73, Characteristics of Urban Transportation Demand, exam-
ines  macro  transportation  characteristics  such  as  daily  trips  per  capita,
daily  trips  by  mode,  average  trip  length,  vehicle  miles  of  travel  per  house-
hold, trip chaining, and parking ratios by type of work site. The final report

provides a compendium of multi-modal information for transportation plan-
ners, provided in both printed and electronic form.
The  Southeastern  Pennsylvania  Transportation  Authority  (SEPTA)  human
resources  department  indicates  that  they  use  the  following  TCRP  publica-
tions, among others, in their on-going training programs:

(1) TCRP  Report  27,  Building  Transit  Ridership:  An  Exploration  of  Tran-

The  American  Planning  Association  is  incorporating  material  from  several
chapters  of  TCRP  Report  102,  Transit  Oriented  Development  in  the  United
States:  Experiences,  Challenges,  and  Prospects  in  their  Transit  Oriented  De-
velopment Planners Training Service course.

The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Highway and Transportation Authority,
Department  of  Public  Works,  Oversight  Systems  Safety  Manager,  incor-
porates TCRP publications for training at Tren Urbano.

• Workforce Development Initiative. Two TCRP reports have served as key
inputs  to  APTA’s  Workforce  Development  Initiative.  TCRP  Research  Results
Digest 45, ‘‘Identification of the Critical Workforce Development Issues in the
Transit  Industry,’’  provides  a  scoping  study  that  identifies:  the  most  impor-
tant challenges that the transit industry faces in workforce development; cur-
rent  innovative  approaches  to  workforce  development  on  the  part  of  both
transit  agencies  and  external  ‘‘benchmarks’’;  the  most  useful  potential  prod-
ucts of the Workforce Development Initiative; and the next steps that should
be  taken  to  help  the  transit  industry  address  workforce  development  on  an
effective, ongoing basis.
TCRP  Report  77,  Managing  Transit’s  Workforce  in  the  New  Millennium,  as-
sesses  the  transit  industry’s  workforce  needs  and  prospects  for  the  coming
decades. Further, the report provides guidelines to enable employers to assess
the their own workforce needs, describes best practices for recruiting and re-
taining  employees,  and  identifies  ways  to  enhance  or  establish  partnerships
between  management  and  labor  for  attracting,  training,  and  maintaining  a
qualified workforce.

• Transit  Scheduling:  Scheduling  is  one  of  the  basic  skills  in  the  transit  in-
dustry.  TCRP  Report  30,  Transit  Scheduling:  Basic  and  Advanced  Manuals,
updates  a  50-year-old  predecessor,  providing  step-by-step  instructions  in  trip
building,  blocking,  run-cutting,  and  rostering.  The  report  is  written  in  the
form  of  a  training  manual,  and  has  proved  very  popular.  The  Metropolitan
Transit Development Board in San Diego requested copies for the scheduling
staff.  University  and  state  DOT  staff  have  also  requested  multiple  copies  for
use  in  graduate  level  courses  and  for  training  staff:  Institute  for  Transpor-
tation Research and Education, North Carolina State University; the National
Center for Advanced Transportation Technology, the University of Idaho; and
the Oregon Department of Transportation. SunTran (Ocala, FL) reports using
Report 30 to train their schedulers.

• Software for Transit Risk Managers: Identification of risk exposure is the
cornerstone  of  the  risk-management  process,  because  the  other  elements  of
risk  management  rest  on  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  this  process.
TCRP  project  G–3  developed  risk  management  software  and  a  User’s  Guide
tailored  to  the  needs  of  transit  risk  managers.  The  software  was  dem-

onstrated  at  the  1996  APTA  Risk  Management  Seminar  and  at  the  1996
APTA  Annual  Meeting.  Copies  were  also  distributed  by  the  usual  J–1  dis-
tribution method. Through the TCRP J–1 project, APTA prepared the product
for  distribution,  professionally  packaged  like  commercial  software.  Two  com-
panion Research Results Digests cover identification of risk exposure, risk as-
sessment,  loss  control  programs,  and  guidelines  for  consistent  collection  of
loss  data.  The  Hillsborough  Area  Regional  Transit  Authority  reported  that
they have used the software extensively to help identify potential risks.

• Technology  Transfer  from  International  Experience.  TCRP  Project  J–
3,  International  Transit  Studies  Program:  The  International  Transit  Studies
Program  is  a  leadership  development  program  intended  to  foster  a  multi-
modal-mobility-manager  approach  to  urban  transportation.  Participants  in
the  program  bring  innovative  ideas  from  overseas  to  transportation  agencies
in  the  United  States.  The  Massachusetts  Bay  Transportation  Authority  re-
ported  three  major  operational  changes  as  a  result  of  staff  exposure  to  new
ideas  from  abroad.  The  Blue  Line  was  converted  to  single-person  train  oper-
ation,  saving  over  $1  million  per  year.  Opponents  of  the  change  were  won
over  by  the  extensive  documentation  of  European  cities  that  made  successful
conversions  to  single-person  train  operation,  by  installing  CCTV  cameras  on
platforms  as  observed  in  Vienna,  and  by  engaging  in  a  public  outreach  cam-
paign. The MBTA also introduced low-floor light rail cars and accelerated the
change  to  a  new  station  management  system  supported  by  the  integration  of
automated  fare  collection  equipment  and  security  systems  based,  in  part,  on
the observations of the modernization of older European transport systems to
much safer, more secure, customer friendly station environments. NJ Transit
reported  that  information  gathered  by  staff  who  participated  in  a  study  mis-
sion  greatly  increased  NJ  Transit’s  confidence  in  low-floor  light  rail  cars  and
helped  support  the  decision  to  purchase  low-floor  cars.  Also  information  on
transit’s  contribution  to  livable  communities  in  Europe  was  used  as  part  of
a transit-friendly land use initiative in New Jersey. NJ Transit also reported
that information obtained in Europe about contactless smart cards was evalu-
ated  for  possible  application  in  New  Jersey.  At  that  time,  European  applica-
tions  had  gone  beyond  testing  to  implementation.  Riverside  Transit  reported
that information about integrated school and public transportation in Europe
assisted  them  with  an  initiative  in  the  Los  Angeles  area  to  demonstrate  the
feasibility of such integrated service. She also reported that information about
corridor  preservation,  the  use  of  art  in  transit,  and  strategies  to  improve  liv-
ability of cities were applicable to issues she was facing at home. The London
Docklands LRT is using moving block signal technology, and American transit
agencies  that  are  considering  this  technology  found  it  reassuring  to  see  that
it  works  in  practice  as  well  as  in  theory.  Participants  were  also  impressed
with  improved  transportation  efficiencies  achieved  in  Britain  through  in-
creased use of private contractors and increased competition.

• Low-Floor  Light  Rail  Vehicles:  A  number  of  transit  systems,  e.g.,  NJ
Transit,  SEPTA,  and  Santa  Clara  County,  have  used  a  TCRP  database  on
available low-floor light rail vehicle (LFLRV) technologies and their character-
istics  as  input  into  the  development  of  potential  LFLRV  specifications.  The
project  demonstrated,  according  to  reports  from  Santa  Clara  County,  that
LRVs with 70 percent of the floor area in low-floor configuration minimize the
risks associated with new rail car design, because they use traditional trucks,
but still provide the advantages of a low floor for ADA compliance. This influ-
enced their decision to plan for low floor LRVs. Santa Clara County staff esti-
mated savings on the order of $20 million, attributable to not building expen-
sive  ramps  for  access  by  the  disabled.  Low-floor  vehicles  accommodate  dis-
abled  persons,  please  the  general  public  because  the  ramps  would  have  de-
tracted from the architectural aesthetics of a downtown transit mall, and save
money. This was a win-win decision.

• Alternative  Fuel  Safety:  NJ  Transit  and  several  bus  manufacturers  re-
ported  that  they  used  TCRP  Synthesis  No.  1,  Safe  Operating  Procedures  for
Alternative  Fuel  Buses,  as  a  planning  tool.  One  bus  manufacturer  reported
that  it  made  copies  available  to  staff  to  inform  them  of  safe  handling  proce-
dures.  At  two  conferences  in  Pennsylvania  on  alternative  fuel  buses,  spon-
sored  by  the  Rural  Transportation  Assistance  Program  (RTAP),  most  of  the
35  to  40  attendees  reportedly  had  this  document  with  them  or  had  read  it.
The  majority  of  knowledge  that  these  operations  personnel  had  about  alter-
native  fuels  at  this  point  reportedly  came  from  TCRP  Synthesis  No.  1.  Fuels

like methanol, compressed natural gas, and liquefied natural gas have charac-
teristics  very  different  from  diesel  fuel  or  gasoline  and  are  dangerous  if  han-
dled  incorrectly.  This  synthesis  provided  information  on  safe  procedures  for
handling alternative fuels.

• Operational  Savings:  TCRP  Report  4,  Aids  for  Rail  Car  Side-Door  Oper-
ation,  provides  guidance  on  the  safest  ways  for  the  operator  to  observe  door
operation,  thereby  making  it  possible  to  eliminate  conductors  in  some  cir-
cumstances.  This  report  was  a  key  information  resource  for  the  Massachu-
setts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) during the conversion of the Blue
Line  to  a  single-person  train  operation  in  1996,  saving  $1  million  annually.
The  report  was  submitted  to  the  Massachusetts  State  Legislature  and  the
state regulatory agency during public hearings concerning the initiative.

• Standardized  Light  Rail  Signing  for  Improved  Safety:  A  draft  version
of a new light rail chapter for the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD)  was  prepared  as  part  of  TCRP  Project  A–5,  Integration  of  Light
Rail  Transit  into  City  Streets.  The  TCRP  contractor  worked  closely  with  the
LRT  Subcommittee  of  the  MUTCD  Committee  on  Railroad-Highway  Grade
Crossings  to  incorporate  a  new  LRT  chapter  into  the  Millennium  version  of
the  MUTCD.  The  MUTCD  is  the  document  that  contains  nationally  accepted
standards for roadway signing and signaling, a critical element of traffic safe-
ty.

• Track  Maintenance  Safety:  A  National  Transportation  Safety  Board
(NTSB)  report  that  was  released  in  January  2008  referred  to  track-worker
alert technology in its report on how to prevent future track-worker incidents.
That track worker alert technology that NTSB referred to was developed and
tested in TCRP IDEA Project 55, ‘‘Warning Device for Rail Rapid Transit Per-
sonnel  for  Approaching  Trains,’’  and  NTSB  demonstrated  that  technology  at
their  public  board  meeting.  The  IDEA  project  included  testing  of  the  tech-
nology  at  MTA  New  York  City  Transit  and  the  Greater  Cleveland  Regional
Transit Authority.

• Reduced  Visual  Impact  of  Overhead  Wire:  The  Greater  Cleveland  RTA
used  the  results  of  TCRP  Project  D–4,  Visual  Impact  of  Overhead  Contact
Systems for Electric Transit Vehicles, in planning an RTA extension. The find-
ings of this project were particularly significant, because citizen opposition to
overhead wire is one of the primary roadblocks to LRT acceptance.

• Transit  Performance  Measures:  The  Wisconsin  DOT  reported  that  two
TCRP  publications  were  very  useful  in  reviewing  transit  performance  meas-
ures  and  their  use  in  allocation  formulas:  TCRP  Synthesis  No.  6,  The  Role
of Performance-Based Measures in Allocating Funding for Transit Operations,
and  The  Quality  Journey:  A  TQM  Roadmap  for  Public  Transportation.  The
experiences  of  other  states  were  found  to  be  particularly  helpful.  TRB  docu-
ments  were  reported  to  be  of  value  in  developing  a  long-range  statewide
transportation  plan  and  in  providing  guidance  to  the  Metropolitan  Planning
Organizations in the state. The Greater Cleveland RTA reported that it used
TCRP Report 88, A Guidebook for Developing a Transit Performance-Measure-
ment System, to assist in a review of their performance-measurement system.
In  addition,  LYNX  in  Orlando,  Florida  indicated  that  it  used  TCRP  Report
88 during its 2004 strategic planning process.

• Public  Transportation  Boards:  TCRP  Report  104,  Public  Transportation
Board  Effectiveness:  A  Self-Assessment  Handbook,  provides  a  self-assessment
process  and  tools  to  measure  public  transportation  board  effectiveness  and
provides  references  on  how  board  characteristics  can  be  changed  to  improve
board effectiveness in various areas. The handbook also identifies the charac-
teristics  of  public  transportation  boards  that  influence  transit  system  per-
formance.  A  number  of  transit  agencies,  including  the  Dallas  Area  Rapid
Transit  (DART),  indicated  that  they  implemented  the  board  self-assessment
process developed in the report. The Small Urban & Rural Transit Center re-
ports  that  it  is  using  Report  104  as  part  of  a  2.5  hour  presentation  on  the
roles and responsibilities of transit board members at the 2007 Dakota Tran-
sit Association Conference.

• Application of Artificial Intelligence To Railcar Maintenance: A poten-
tially  cost-effective  use  of  artificial  intelligence  technology  was  identified  to
assist  railcar  maintenance  personnel  in  their  diagnosis  of  railcar  propulsion
system  maintenance  problems.  TCRP  Report  1,  Artificial  Intelligence  For

Transit  Railcar  Diagnostics,  recommended  testing  the  technology  on  the  pro-
pulsion  system,  because  the  potential  for  savings  is  the  greatest.  The  project
was  continued  in  order  to  conduct  an  operational  test  of  the  concept.  A  suc-
cessful  demonstration  was  completed  at  the  Washington  Metropolitan  Area
Transit Authority. The results of the demonstration are summarized in TCRP
Report 44.

• Commuter Benefits Programs: TCRP Reports 87, Strategies for Increasing
the Effectiveness of Commuter Benefits Programs, and 107, Assessing the Costs
and  Benefits  of  Commuter  Benefits  Programs,  provide  significant  information
and  guidance  regarding  the  implementation  of  commuter  benefits  programs.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has indicated that informa-
tion  from  these  publications  is  being  used  to  document  some  of  the  impacts
that  might  result  from  the  EPA’s  Best  Workplaces  for  Commuters  Program.
In  addition,  the  contractors  for  Report  107  were  presented  with  the  2005
Transportation  Demand  Management  Institute  Research  Excellence  Award.
This  award  is  presented  annually  to  the  research  project  noted  for  its  sub-
stantial contribution to the field of transportation demand management.

• Transit  Security:  The  Cambria  County  Transit  Authority  (CamTran)  in
Johnstown,  Pennsylvania  reports  that  it  used  the  revised  final  report  for
Project J–10D, Security Planning Tools for Rural, Small Urban, and Commu-
nity-Based  Public  Transportation  Operations  (to  be  published  as  Report  86/
Volume 10 in early 2006) to assist them in the development of an Emergency
and Security Plan that was required from the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity  to  receive  security  funds  for  their  Johnstown  Inclined  Plane.  CamTran
reported  ‘‘. . .  the  TCRP  document  has  been  invaluable  to  us  in  providing
structure and direction in what we need to get it done properly . . .. We have
looked  at  many  other  agency  plans  and  we  have  looked  at  what  FTA  and
FEMA  has  to  offer  and  it  is  just  overwhelming.  This  TCRP  document  kept
us on track and focused on what we needed.’’

SEPTA in Philadelphia reports extensively using TCRP Report 86, Volume
8,  Continuity  of  Operations  (COOP)  Planning  Guidelines  for  Transportation
Agencies, as a valuable resource in developing their internal continuity of op-
erations plan. The City of College Station, Texas, is using material from this
report to develop its COOP plan.

Florida DOT reports that it hired the principal investigator of TCRP Report
86,  Volume  10,  Hazard  and  Security  Plan  Workshop:  Instructor  Guide,  to
offer  the  workshop  in  several  locations  statewide.  Mississippi  DOT  has  also
made  the  course  available  for  its  transit  systems,  both  pre-  and  post-Hurri-
cane Katrina. The Texas DOT is conducting four workshops around the state
that  are  based  on  this  TCRP  report  and  its  CD–ROM.  At  one  of  the  work-
shops,  a  participant  indicated  ‘‘. . .  the  things  addressed  were  instantly  ap-
plicable  to  our  operation  at  Citibus  and  for  the  first  time  since  I  got  the  re-
sponsibility  of  our  security  plan,  I  felt  like  I  learned  strategies  that  I  could
suggest for implementation.’’

The  Coast  Guard  reports  that  it  is  incorporating  material  from  TCRP  Re-
port  86,  Volume  11,  Security  Measures  for  Ferry  Systems,  in  its  training  for
new terminal pilots. The general security measures (GSM) evaluation and se-
lection  tool  included  in  the  report  will  also  be  included  in  a  Coast  Guard
Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC). Material from the revised
final  report  was  also  incorporated  into  internal  Coast  Guard  documents  for
its operational commanders.

The  California  Office  of  Homeland  Security  used  material  from  the  TCRP
Report  86  public  transportation  security  series  (Volumes  1–12)  in  developing
its internal policies and procedures.

The  Chicago  Transit  Authority  reports  that  it  has  frequently  turned  to  re-
ports  from  TCRP  when  analyzing  security  issues  and  policies.  They  indicate
that  TRB  is  the  first  source  turned  to  when  looking  for  reports  on  useful
transportation security practices.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  David  J.  Wise,  Acting  Director,  Physical  Infrastructure  Issues,  U.S.

Government Accountability Office

Question submitted by Chair David Wu
Q1. What  would  GAO  consider  to  be  adequate  performance  measures  for  evaluating

the impact of the DOT RD&T investment?

A1. RITA’s  primary  responsibilities  include  reviewing  DOT’s  research  activities  to
ensure  that  research  throughout  DOT  has  been  evaluated  according  to  best  prac-
tices,  thereby  demonstrating  the  effectiveness  of  RD&T  investment.  We  rec-
ommended that RITA develop an overall strategy, evaluation plan, and performance
goals  and  measures  for  this  and  its  other  coordination  and  facilitation  responsibil-
ities. RITA has taken some steps to do so, but still lacks an overall strategy, evalua-
tion plan, and performance measures for its review responsibilities.

While  evaluating  RD&T  impact  is  not  an  easy  undertaking,  it  does  not  have  to
be  solely  focused  on  gauging  outcomes—since  the  outcomes  of  RD&T  often  cannot
be  quantified  in  advance.  The  National  Academies  and  our  previous  work  echoed
that  setting  clear  RD&T  goals  and  measuring  their  progress,  using  expert  review
to evaluate the quality of research and outcomes, and reporting periodically in eval-
uation  results  can  help  agencies  systematically  evaluate  RD&T  outcomes.1 One  ap-
proach that has been used in this area is to measure technology transfer. For exam-
ple,  key  experts  and  stakeholders  told  us  that  one  way  that  the  Office  of  Pipeline
Safety’s  RD&T  program  could  be  measured  is  by  the  degree  to  which  new  tech-
nologies  developed  by  the  program  were  actually  used  by  pipeline  operators.  Simi-
larly,  according  to  a  RITA  official,  the  Federal  Railroad  Administration  measures
the  performance  of  its  RD&T  activities  by  how  many  times  RD&T  programs  are
used in real world applications.

Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. Your report states that RITA has taken steps to develop appropriate performance
measures,  including  gathering  information  of  the  operating  administrations  on
their  performance  measures  through  the  RD&T  Planning  Team.  You  further
state  that  RITA  officials  will  determine  what  measures  could  be  adopted  after
all  of  the  operating  administrations  have  had  input.  Do  you  know  when  RITA
began these meetings of the Planning Team and how often the Team meets? Has
DOT moved expeditiously to meet this requirement?

A1. In  2006,  we  recommended  that  RITA  work  with  the  operating  administrations
to  develop  common  performance  measures  for  the  department’s  RD&T  activities.2
RITA  has  taken  some  steps  to  do  so.  According  to  a  RITA  official,  in  November
2008,  the  agency  began  gathering  information  from  the  operating  administrations
on  performance  measures  during  RD&T  Planning  Team  meetings.  The  Planning
Team is required to meet quarterly, but has met more frequently. In 2008, the Plan-
ning  Team  met  13  times,  and  the  team  has  met  twice  thus  far  in  2009.  A  RITA
official  told  us  that  they  have  finished  the  process  of  gathering  information  on  per-
formance measures, and are analyzing the information for commonalities and to de-
termine  whether  any  of  the  measures  could  be  adopted  for  the  department’s  RD&T
activities.  We  will  continue  to  monitor  RITA’s  progress  in  developing  and  imple-
menting performance measures.
Q2. Overall, does GAO believe that RITA can successfully plan and coordinate trans-
portation  R&D  projects  in-house  and  across  the  Department?  Is  the  RPIC  proc-
ess as currently operating sufficient for these purposes? For instance, does RITA
have  access  to  data  on  the  budget  and  performance  of  all  R&D  at  the  Depart-
ment?

A2. The  RPIC  process  began  in  fiscal  year  2009  and  has  not  been  in  place  long
enough  to  assess  whether  it  will  enable  RITA  to  successfully  coordinate,  facilitate,
and review the department’s RD&T activities, or enable RITA to develop an overall
strategy. A RITA official told us that they have begun the RPIC process using fiscal
year  2009  planned  budget  information  (they  do  not  have  performance  information
at  this  time)  and  plan  to  compare  planned  budget  information  to  actual  budget  in-
formation  once  the  budget  is  enacted.  While  the  RPIC  process  seems  like  a  step  in
the right direction, DOT has not yet documented this new process or explained how
it complements or replaces its existing coordination and review strategies. According
to  a  RITA  official,  RITA  is  planning  to  develop  a  detailed  description  of  the  RPIC
process and hopes to have this completed by late spring. In our 2006 report, we rec-
ommended  that  RITA  develop  an  evaluation  plan  for  its  own  activities,  so  it  could
better  assess  whether  its  activities  and  process,  including  RPIC,  are  meeting  in-
tended goals. RITA has not yet developed such an evaluation plan.
Q3. Do we need to produce a new, comprehensive strategy for our nation’s highways?
If  so,  should  this  strategy  include  other  transportation  modes?  Who  should  be
charged  with  developing  such  as  strategy  and  how  often  should  it  be  updated?
A3. We have reported that surface transportation programs need to be re-examined,
especially  given  the  Nation’s  financial  crisis  and  growing  congestion  and  travel  de-
mand.3 Since  federal  financing  for  the  interstate  highway  system  was  established
in  1956  because  of  the  national  interest  in  interstate  mobility,  the  federal  role  in
surface  transportation  has  expanded  to  include  broader  goals,  more  programs,  and
a  variety  of  program  structures.  To  incorporate  additional  transportation,  environ-
mental  and  societal  goals,  federal  surface  transportation  programs  have  grown  in
number  and  complexity.  However,  the  federal  highway  program’s  financing  and  de-
livery mechanisms have not substantially changed and their continued relevance in
the 21st century is unclear.

Many  of  these  programs  are  not  effective  at  addressing  key  transportation  chal-
lenges  such  as  increasing  congestion  and  growing  freight  demand  because  federal
goals and roles are unclear, many programs lack links to needs or performance, and
the  programs  in  some  areas  do  not  employ  the  best  tools  and  approaches  to  ensure
effective  investment  decisions.  For  example,  most  highway  funds  are  distributed
through  formulas  that  have  only  an  indirect  relationship  to  needs  and  no  relation-
ship to performance or outcomes.

We have called for a fundamental re-examination of the Nation’s surface transpor-
tation  policies.  We  identified  a  number  of  principles  that  could  help  drive  reexam-
ination of federal surface transportation programs and an assessment of options for
restructuring  the  federal  surface  transportation  program.  These  principles  include:
(1) ensuring goals are well defined and focused on the federal interest, (2) ensuring
the federal role in achieving each goal is clearly defined, (3) ensuring accountability
for  results  by  entities  receiving  federal  funds,  (4)  employing  the  best  tools  and  ap-
proaches to emphasize return on targeted federal investment, and (5) ensuring fiscal
sustainability.

With  the  sustainability  and  performance  issues  of  current  programs,  it  is  an  op-
portune  time  for  Congress  to  more  clearly  define  the  federal  role  in  transportation
and  improve  progress  toward  specific,  nationally-defined  outcomes.  Given  the  scope
of  needed  transformation,  it  may  be  necessary  to  shift  policies  and  programs  incre-
mentally or on a pilot basis to gain practical lessons for a coherent, sustainable, and
effective  national  program  and  financing  structure  to  best  serve  the  Nation  for  the
21st century.

STATEMENT OF LAWRENCE H. ORCUTT

CHIEF, DIVISION OF RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

This  testimony  is  intended  to  address  the  following  four  questions  posed  to  the
Division  of  Research  and  Innovation,  California  Department  of  Transportation
(Caltrans):

1. How  has  the  federal  investment  in  R&D  through  the  UTCs,  NCHRP,  SHRP

II, etc. impacted current infrastructure construction practice?

2. What barriers prevent adoption of new techniques or applications?
3. How can the Federal Government ensure that State, county, and city decision-

makers make informed decisions (i.e., LTAP)?

4. Is  the  current  workforce  capable  of  implementing  advanced  highway  tech-

nologies?

INTRODUCTION
Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee:

My name is Lawrence Orcutt. I am the Chief of the Division of Research and In-
novation  for  the  California  Department  of  Transportation,  also  known  as  Caltrans.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide you with this written testimony.

The  Division  of  Research  and  Innovation  (DRI)  receives  $10–15  million  per  year
from  the  Federal  Highway  Administration  (FHWA)  to  fund  the  State  Planning  and
Research  Program,  Part  2.  In  addition,  in  2008  Caltrans  was  notified  of  receiving
$10–15 million in federal grants through various competitive processes that include
Safe Trip-21: Connected Traveler (Research and Innovative Technology Administra-
tion), Vehicle Assist and Automation (sponsored by Federal Transit Administration),
Augmented  Speed  Enforcement  (sponsored  by  the  Rural  Safety  Initiative-FHWA),
and  a  Truck  Parking  Initiative  grant  to  fund  a  project  along  the  Interstate  5  (I–
5) Corridor (sponsored by FHWA).

I  serve  on  the  Transportation  Research  Board’s  (TRB)  Strategic  Highway  Re-
search Program 2 (SHRP 2) Safety Technical Coordinating Committee, and I am the
Co-Chair for the TRB Technology Transfer Committee. I also serve on the Research
and Technology Coordinating Committee (RTCC) that serves as an independent ad-
visor  to  FHWA  and  other  research  organizations  on  national  and  federal  highway
research that has been supported by FHWA.

Innovation is one of the four core values that guide and shape Caltrans, and staff
is empowered to seek creative solutions and take intelligent risks. Caltrans has the
largest  and  one  of  the  most  vigorous  research  programs  in  the  Nation.  Mr.  Randell
H.  Iwasaki,  Chief  Deputy  Director  for  Caltrans,  provided  testimony  to  your  sub-
committee  in  June  2008  about  some  of  the  nationally  significant  infrastructure-re-
lated technologies that Caltrans has developed such as, long-life pavement rehabili-
tation  strategies,  and  rapid  rehabilitation  strategies  (Construction  Analysis  for
Pavement  Rehabilitation  Strategies).  I  will  be  providing  more  detailed  information
about these two innovations later in my testimony.

Caltrans  has  been  focused  on  deploying  research  results  to  achieve  true  innova-
tion  so  that  research  becomes  reality.  Through  the  guidance  of  the  Caltrans  Re-
search and Deployment Steering Committee and by establishing a deployment group
that is responsible for developing and implementing research deployment strategies,
Caltrans  has  become  a  leader  in  transportation  research  deployment.  Examples  of
some of the challenges and solutions to research deployment are included in my tes-
timony.

One  of  the  most  significant  issues  facing  California  and  the  Nation  is  the  need
to  develop  and  implement  transportation  innovations.  In  the  Safe,  Accountable,
Flexible,  Efficient  Transportation  Equity  Act—A  Legacy  for  Users  (SAFETEA–LU),
Congress  recognized  the  importance  of  innovation  per  the  Principles  for  Research
based on Title V:

‘‘The  federal  portfolio  should  cover  the  full  innovation  cycle,  including  the  fol-
lowing:
• Agenda setting,
• Conduct of research,
• Support of research and technology transfer by the states,
• Sharing of results, and
• Deployment (including education and training).’’

In the Research and Technology Coordinating Committee, TRB Special Report 295

it is recommended that:

‘‘Adequate  resources  should  be  provided  to  FHWA  to  support  a  robust  program
for  dissemination  of  research  results  to  states,  local  governments,  and  private
vendors.’’

Congress  had  the  excellent  foresight  to  require  an  implementation  report  for
SHRP 2. ‘‘As part of SHRP 2 authorization, Congress requested that a report be de-
livered  in  early  2009  concerning  promising  results  from  the  research  and  how  they
could be implemented most effectively. In response to this request, the TRB’s report
Implementing  the  Results  of  the  Second  Strategic  Highway  Research  Program:  Sav-
ing Lives, Reducing Congestion, Improving Quality of Life outlines what it will take
to implement the results of the program and reap the benefits it promises.’’

The  recommendations  listed  in  the  report  are  very  consistent  with  the  Caltrans
focus  on  deploying  research  results  to  achieve  innovation:  ‘‘A  SHRP  2  implementa-
tion  program  should  be  established  and  stable  and  predictable  funding  should  be
provided over several years to support SHRP 2 implementation activities.’’

The legislative recommendations from the American Association of State Highway
and  Transportation  Officials  (AASHTO)  developed  by  the  Standing  Committee  on
Research also requests resources for research deployment:

‘‘Legislative  Recommendations  Summary:  Initiation  of  a  new  Research  Deploy-
ment Program, funded at $5 million annually.
Policy Issue Discussion/Background:
Research products are difficult to deploy into practice. Many reasons contribute
to this, and many are documented in the NCHRP Report 442, Systems Approach
to  Evaluating  Innovations  for  Integration  into  Highway  Practice.  One  of  the
most  significant  reasons  hindering  the  deployment  of  a  research  product  is  a
lack  of  a  focused  national  program  with  resources  to  identify  and  share  the
most successful research deployments.
A  program  should  be  established  that  facilitates  the  deployment  of  successful
research  products.  This  program  should  be  multi-modal  and  conducted  under
the  guidance  of  stakeholders  who  are  the  ultimate  users  of  the  research.  The
program  would  develop  and  implement  project  deployment  plans,  communica-
tions,  and  demonstration  activities.  The  program  should  be  able  to  advise  and
assist  stakeholders  with  unique  implementation  problems,  such  as  intellectual
property,  feasibility  studies,  cost  benefit  analysis,  and  ease  of  implementation.’’
The  Federal  Investment  in  Highway  Research,  2006–2009:  Strengths  and  Weak-
nesses—Special  Report  295  makes  an  excellent  argument  for  implementing  innova-
tion:

‘‘The  challenges  facing  the  highway  system  cannot  be  addressed  simply  by
spending  more  money,  even  if  doing  so  were  possible.  Funding  for  highways  is
currently constrained by the sharp draw-down in the federal highway trust fund
and  a  general  unwillingness  to  raise  fees  or  taxes  that  support  transportation
infrastructure.  Successfully  addressing  many  of  the  challenges  discussed  above
will require new and more efficient ways of doing things—new materials, better
and faster construction techniques, safer designs, better information for drivers,
new  financing  mechanisms,  options  for  pricing  use  of  the  system,  and  many
more.  This  is  the  role  that  research,  development,  deployment,  and  training
must fill. ‘‘

QUESTION  1. How  has  the  federal  investment  in  R&D  through  the  UTCs,
NCHRP,  SHRP  II,  etc.  impacted  current  infrastructure  con-
struction practice?

OVERVIEW

The  California  Department  of  Transportation  (Caltrans)  built  and  oversees  a
78,000 lane-kilometers (lane-km, or one lane, one kilometer) State highway system.
Much  of  that  system  needs  repair.  Rebuilding  our  transportation  infrastructure  af-
fects  all  Californians  as  well  as  our  national  economy  and  global  commerce.  Much
of  our  problem  focuses  on  meeting  the  challenge  of  how  to  rebuild  deteriorating
highways  economically,  safely,  and  with  minimal  impacts  and  inconvenience  to  the
public.

Cutting-edge pavement research at Caltrans and the University of California has
been  helping  find  ways  to  rebuild  our  highways.  Pavement  research  methods  and
findings have potential use on other projects. For example, results from traffic stud-

ies in work zones are available for research and deployment of Intelligent Transpor-
tation  Systems  (ITS).  Also,  results  may  help  improve  pavements  at  ports  and  rail-
heads. The state-of-the-art research tools are also adaptable to local agencies to use
in  improving  city  streets  and  county  roads.  In  this  way,  results  from  Caltrans  re-
search are better able to produce benefits for all Californians and all Americans.

BACKGROUND  LONG  LIFE  PAVEMENT  REHABILITATION  STRATEGIES

(LLPRS)

The  three  examples  I  will  describe,  all  stem  from  the  Caltrans  Long-Life  Pave-
ment  Rehabilitation  Strategies  (LLPRS)  Program  which  began  in  1998.  The  goal  of
the LLPRS program is to rebuild approximately 2,800 lane-km of high-volume urban
freeway with pavements that are designed to last more than 30 years with minimal
maintenance.  LLPRS  also  addresses  the  State’s  need  for  cost-effective  approaches
for rebuilding the aging pavements in its urban highway networks. The LLPRS pro-
gram  will  reduce  the  need  for  future  repair  projects  and  ultimately  save  public  re-
sources for future generations of road users.

LLPRS  candidate  projects  were  selected  from  among  highways  that  experience
minimum  volume  demands  of  150,000  Average  Daily  Traffic  or  15,000  Average
Daily  Truck  Traffic,  and  that  have  poor  structural  pavement  condition  and  ride
quality. Most LLPRS candidate sections are Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pave-
ments on Interstate freeways in urban networks, 80 percent of which are within the
Los Angeles Basin, and 15 percent of which are in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Caltrans has been working with the Partnered Pavement Research Center (at the
University  of  California,  Berkeley)  since  1994  using  the  Heavy  Vehicle  Simulator
(HVS) and Accelerated Pavement Testing to develop new pavement products for in-
frastructure  improvements.  In  2005,  Caltrans  approved  an  issue  memo  titled,
‘‘Adoption of Mechanistic-Empirical (ME) Pavement Design Method,’’ which calls for
the  adoption  of  ME  pavement  design  methodology  to  replace  existing  pavement  de-
sign  methods  which  have  been  in  place  since  the  early  1960s.  Since  2000,  the  Uni-
versity  of  California  Pavement  Research  Center  (UCPRC)  has  been  supporting  the
Caltrans effort to adopt ME pavement design by using a wide array of tools, includ-
ing HVS full-scale pavement tests. This work is under the technical guidance of the
Caltrans Pavement Standards Team. One of the Team’s tasks is to develop and cali-
brate  ME  flexible  pavement  design  and  models  for  new  pavements  and  rehabilita-
tion.  These  models  have  been  incorporated  into  a  draft  software  program  called
CalME. The validation and calibration of the models in CalME was first performed
using performance data from HVS tests completed by the UCPRC between 1995 and
2004. Calibration of CalME models also has been achieved using WesTrack perform-
ance data.

The following are three Caltrans LLPRS projects:

1. LLPRS Pilot Project: Interstate 10 Concrete Rehabilitation in Pomona

In February 2000, a 20-lane-km rehabilitation project on Interstate 10 near Los
Angeles,  California,  was  successfully  completed.  Fast  setting  hydraulic  cement
concrete  was  applied  because  it  reached  traffic  opening  strength  in  only  four
hours after its placement. The project required one weekend closure to complete
2.8 lane-km and repeated seven and ten-hour nighttime closures for the remain-
ing  distance.  The  rehabilitation  project  consisted  of  replacing  the  existing  230
millimeter concrete slab with new concrete, dowels, and tie bars. The contractor
used  a  concurrent  working  method  in  which  demolition  and  concrete  paving  oc-
curred simultaneously and only a single lane was removed and replaced.
The  delivery  and  discharge  of  concrete  controlled  the  overall  progress.  The  55-
hour weekend closure proceeded at a rate 54 percent faster than the average of
nighttime  closures,  as  measured  by  number  of  slabs  replaced  per  hour.  A  com-
prehensive  traffic  management  strategy  helped  to  reduce  the  volume  of  traffic
during the weekend closure and minimize the traffic delay through the construc-
tion work zone.
This  ‘‘proof  of  concept’’  LLPRS  project,  which  used  concrete  material,  was  fol-
lowed by another project using asphalt materials.

2. LLPRS Demonstration Project: Interstate 710 Asphalt Concrete Rehabili-

tation in Long Beach
Caltrans  successfully  rebuilt  a  4.4-km  stretch  of  Interstate  710  in  Long  Beach,
California, by adopting a fast-track construction approach that included around-
the-clock (24/7) operations. The project proved that fast-track rehabilitation with
55-hour  weekend  closures  is  effective  to  drastically  shorten  overall  construction
time and lessen the negative effects of construction in an urban area. This eased

congestion for the public, as well as freight moving to and from the ports of Long
Beach (the second busiest port in the United States) and Los Angeles.
The  project  proved  that  asphalt  concrete  pavement  designed  to  provide  a  30+
year  design  life  can  be  constructed  in  a  series  of  weekend  closures  even  on  the
most  heavily  loaded  truck  route  in  the  state.  This  long-life  asphalt  concrete
pavement  rehabilitation  project  occurred  during  the  summer  of  2003.  On  this
project,  either  230  millimeters  of  asphalt  concrete  overlay  or  325  millimeters  of
full-depth asphalt concrete replacement were applied during eight 55-hour week-
end closures. After five years of monitoring, the pavement is performing as pre-
dicted  by  research  and  pavement  tests  conducted  for  Caltrans  by  the  UCPRC.
3. LLPRS Implementation Project: Interstate 15 Concrete Rehabilitation in

Devore
Fast-track  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  innovations  have  been  researched
and  deployed  in  California.  One  example  is  the  heavily  traveled  Interstate  15
corridor in Devore, California. A 4.5-km stretch of badly damaged concrete truck
lanes  was  rebuilt  in  only  two  210-hour  (about  nine  days),  extended  closures
using  counter-flow  traffic  and  24-hour  operations.  The  same  project  would  have
taken ten months using traditional nighttime closures.

Compared  to  traditional  ten-hour  nighttime  closures,  the  extended  closure  had
about  80  percent  less  total  closure  time,  about  30  percent  less  road  user  cost  due
to  traffic  delay,  and  about  25  percent  less  Caltrans  cost  (about  $6  million  savings)
for construction and traffic control.

Specific  innovations  adopted  for  this  groundbreaking  ‘‘Rapid  Rehab’’  project  in-

clude the following:

• Automated  Work  Zone  Information  Systems  to  update  travelers  with

• Quickchange  Movable  Barrier  system  with  a  dynamic  lane  configuration

• Incentive/disincentive  provisions  to  encourage  the  contractor  to  complete

real-time travel information

to minimize traffic disruption

the closures on time

• Multifaceted  outreach  program  and  web-based  information  systems

for disseminating project updates and getting input from the public

• Mix design of rapid strength concrete to  enable  the  project  to  be  opened

to traffic 12 hours after placement.

RAPID REHAB

One significant R&D product that is changing planning and management of high-
way construction across the country, specifically pavement rehabilitation projects, is
Rapid  Rehab.  Rapid  Rehab,  also  known  as  Construction  Analysis  for  Pavement  Re-
habilitation Strategies, or CA4PRS, is a software package that was developed by the
UCPRC with funding from DRI. CA4PRS aids engineers and contractors in selecting
economical  highway  rehabilitation  strategies  that  minimize  disruptions  to  drivers
and  to  the  surrounding  community.  It  identifies  optimal  construction  management
strategies  that  balance  construction  schedules  with  traveler  inconvenience  while
minimizing agency costs by considering ‘‘what if’’ scenarios for variables such as con-
struction  time  windows,  number  of  lanes  to  be  closed,  material  selection,  and  site
access for construction vehicles (16).

Rapid Rehab Development, Testing, and Implementation Progress

CA4PRS  was  developed  outside  of  the  normal  Caltrans  Information  Technology
(CIT)  development  process  using  a  Transportation  Pooled  Fund  project  with  the
States of Washington, Minnesota, and Texas participating in the pooled fund effort.
CA4PRS was first tested in 1999 in a construction project along a stretch of Inter-
state  10  near  Pomona,  east  of  Los  Angeles,  California.  Data  from  that  project  vali-
dated  CA4PRS  simulated  production  rates  and  impacts  on  traffic.  Before  the  work
began, the contractor’s estimate for a 55-hour weekend production rate was 3.5 lane-
km.  CA4PRS’  estimate  was  2.9  lane-km.  Actual  performance  came  to  2.8  lane-km
(17).

The  second  major  construction  project  was  on  Interstate  710  near  Long  Beach  in
Southern  California  in  2002.  The  original  construction  plan  called  for  ten  55-hour
weekend  closures.  However,  encouraged  by  an  incentive  provision  of  $100,000  for
each weekend closure eliminated, the contractor used CA4PRS and finished the job
in eight consecutive closures instead of ten and claimed a $200,000 bonus (18).

The  third  major  project  was  in  2004  along  a  4.5-km  stretch  of  Interstate  15  near
Devore  in  Southern  California.  Original  construction  schedule  called  for  10-month
nighttime-only closures. However, using CA4PRS proposed scenario, this badly dam-
aged  concrete  stretch  was  rebuilt  in  two  single-roadbed  continuous  closures  (also
called ‘‘extended closures’’) totaling 210 hours, using counter-flow traffic (opposite di-
rection  to  the  main  traffic  flow)  and  24-hour-per-day  construction  operations  (17).
The  AASHTO  Technology  Implementation  Group  in  2006  designated  CA4PRS  as
a  ‘‘priority  technology’’  because  CA4PRS  proved  to  be  a  valuable  time  and  money
saving innovation.

In  2007,  CA4PRS  was  nominated  and  earned  the  International  Road  Federation
Global  Road  Achievement  Award  for  the  Research  Category.  CA4PRS  is  also  in-
cluded  on  the  FHWA  Priority  Market-Ready  Technology  list.  During  a  recent  cere-
mony  with  the  Director  of  Caltrans,  the  question  was  asked,  ‘‘Why  aren’t  we  using
this  tool  on  all  of  our  projects?’’  Caltrans  is  working  to  make  CA4PRS  part  of  the
standard design practices for all projects.

At the national level, Caltrans has been working with FHWA to assist other State
Departments  of  Transportation  in  the  purchase  of  the  licensing  rights  through  the
Highways  for  Life  Program.  The  University  of  California  has  established  a  cost  of
$150,000  for  all  states  to  be  allowed  exclusive  rights  to  use  CA4PRS.  The  current
cost  for  a  state  to  purchase  a  CA4PRS  enterprise  license  is  $5,000,  which  is  rel-
atively inexpensive.

Conclusion

Through partnering with University of California researchers, Caltrans used inno-
vative  technologies  to  begin  rebuilding  California’s  infrastructure.  These  examples
show  pavement  improvements  being  made  in  California  that  both  improve  how
pavements are designed and built, and also help to manage the construction impacts
to  traffic  by  considering  work  windows  that  allow  contractors  get  the  work  done
quicker, cheaper, and with better quality. The overall construction cost savings total
more than $20 million for the LLPRS program using the new technologies developed
by  this  research  program.  Rebuilding  America’s  infrastructure  will  require  new
methods  and  technologies  similar  to  those  developed  in  California  using  federal  re-
search  funding  to  develop  products  that  will  improve  our  transportation  products
and services.
QUESTION  2. What  barriers  prevent  adoption  of  new  techniques  or  appli-

cations?

INTRODUCTION

In  the  transportation  world  of  the  21st  century,  many  challenges  are  created  by
inadequate  resources  needed  to  address  today’s  massive  transportation  problems  of
congestion, failing infrastructure and environmental impacts of transportation, most
notably worsening air quality and climate change. Innovation should, and could lead
to  improving  the  performance,  efficiency,  and  quality  of  the  transportation  system
as well as reducing their environmental impacts.

Innovation  is  much  needed  to  manage  the  enormity  and  complexity  of  transpor-
tation system. As noted in the TRB Special Report 261, ‘‘complexity of the transpor-
tation  challenges  underscores  the  need  for  new  ways  of  looking  at  problems  and  for
innovative  solutions,  offering  significant  research  opportunities  in  all  facets  of  the
highway sector’’ (1).

COMMON BARRIERS TO INNOVATION

Different types of innovations face different obstacles. The more radical or disrup-
tive an innovation is, the more challenges will accompany its acceptance and imple-
mentation.  A  thorough  literature  search  (particularly  the  2001  TRB  Special  Report
261) (1) helped the department to identify six major barriers to innovation in trans-
portation as summarized below.
1. System Diversity and Complexity

The  United  States  Transportation  system  is  diverse,  decentralized,  and  multi-
faceted.  Conflicting  public  and  private  sector  incentives  add  to  such  complexity
(1).  Fragmentation,  disagreement  among  public  works  constituencies,  and  com-
petition  among  public  works  categories  for  scarce  resources  have  combined  to
constrain innovation (7).

2. Intellectual Property and Procurement Restrictions

The  public  sector  procurement  practices  impose  constraints  on  innovation  (1).
Public  sector  procurement  activity  is  driven  by  low-bid  process  based  on  speci-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:26 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047544 PO 00000 Frm 00128 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\T&I09\021209\47544 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

121

fications and procedures established to satisfy the need for open competition and
accountability  (7).  Competitive  bidding  requirements  represent  a  core  problem
because  often  certain  innovations  are  offered  by  a  single  company.  Conflict  be-
tween open public bidding processes and private Intellectual Property (IP) rights
can hamper deployment of innovative products (9). Excluding evaluation contrac-
tors  from  implementation  contracts  can  limit  competition  at  the  deployment
stage (8).

3. Risk Aversion

There is notable low tolerance for risk in the public sector (1). Public sector deci-
sion-makers work in an environment that does not reward risk taking. If public
officials  are  uneducated  about  or  unfamiliar  with  the  potential  of  innovative
technology or uncertain of its merits, they are reluctant to adopt it (7).

4. Resistance or Inability to Change

Organizations limit and resist change (1). ‘‘When optimal resolution of a product
or process performance problem demands a very different set of knowledge than
a  firm  has  accumulated,  it  may  very  well  stumble’’  (10).  Lack  of  training  and
unskilled employees often inhibits technological change (8).

5. Lack of Profit Motives

Public  sector  innovation  is  not  subject  to  the  profit  motive  that  stimulates  com-
mercial  innovation  (7).  Disruptive  technologies  are  ‘‘initially  embraced  by  the
least-profitable customers in a market’’ (10). Companies that let customers iden-
tify only new products that promise greater profitability and growth ‘‘are rarely
able  to  build  a  case  for  investing  in  disruptive  technologies  until  it  is  too  late’’
(10).

6. Lack of Product Evaluation Criteria

It  is  often  difficult  to  characterize  and  predict  system  and  component  perform-
ance of new innovative products (1). New product evaluation guidelines are slow
to develop and are often under-resourced (8). Evaluation requirements are some-
times unclear or not defined (9). At the Caltrans it is particularly difficult to get
business cases for Information Technology products approved through the exten-
sive  and  cumbersome  Feasibility  Study  Report  process  imposed  by  other  regu-
latory agencies (8).

THREE MAJOR CALIFORNIA CASE STUDIES

Recently, Caltrans completed research and development of three technological in-
novations  the  implementation  of  which  covers  a  wide  spectrum  of  barriers  in  en-
countered in new transportation technologies.
I.

SensysΤΜ is  a  revolutionary  traffic  sensing  innovation  that  combines  latest
communications  in  roads  and  highways  technologies  that  was  implemented  in
an evolutionary manner.

II. Rapid Rehab (also known as Construction Analysis for Pavement Rehabilitation
Strategies,  CA4PRS),  is  a  strategic  and  tactical  planning,  and  control  software
innovation that is being implemented in an evolutionary fashion.

III. Balsi  Beam  is  an  evolutionary  safety  hardware  innovation  that  needed  revolu-

tionary approach to implementation.

Although  these  innovations  promised  significant  return  on  investment,  deploy-
ment  of  each  faced  numerous  and  significant  challenges  that  delayed  implementa-
tion.

I. SENSYSTM CASE STUDY

SensysTM is  a  compact,  self-contained,  easy-to-install,  highly  reliable,  low  cost
wireless traffic sensor system that can replace traditional, more expensive inductive
loops. The Sensys concept originated through the Partners for Advanced Transit and
Highways (PATH) Program, at the University of California, Berkeley (UC–Berkeley)
through  a  special  research  program  in  2002  dedicated  to  exploring  new  ideas.
Through  Caltrans’  DRI,  the  program  provided  up  to  $25,000  for  one-year  research
proposals strictly intended to test or demonstrate new ideas and concepts.

The  $25,000  Sensys  proposal  was  to  investigate  the  potential  use  of  a  new  wire-
less detector that could collect similar traffic data collected by wired inductive loops
that  have  been  in  use  since  1960.  The  research  proposed  to  investigate  the  use  of
micro  electro-mechanical  systems  (MEMS)  acoustic  sensors,  a  prototype  of  which
was  developed  earlier  in  the  Department  of  Electrical  Engineering  and  Computer
Science  at  UC–Berkeley  under  a  previously  sponsored  Defense  Advanced  Research

122

Project  Agency  (DARPA)  project.  Researchers  proposed  to  test  how  well  the  MEMS
sensor network would detect traffic in urban streets and parking lots and determine
how effectively these sensors can operate in an urban traffic environment, and how
much spatial and temporal resolution can be achieved (11).

The  Sensys  research  proposal  was  approved  and  Caltrans,  which  allowed  the  re-
searchers  to  explore  and  test  the  concept  within  one  year,  provided,  seed  money.
During  the  research,  the  researchers  switched  from  the  initial  detection  technology
(acoustical  sensors)  to  magneto-resistive  sensor.  They  also  redesigned  the  system’s
protocol  to  increase  communications  efficiency  and  reduce  energy  consumption  (12).
The first Sensys prototype was ready for testing in 2003.

SensysTM Roadblocks

Two of the main barriers that the implementation of the new Sensys system faced
emerged  at  the  testing  stage.  There  was  no  funding  allocated  for  testing  and  there
were  no  criteria  with  which  to  evaluate  its  effectiveness.  Other  roadblocks  faced  by
Caltrans include:
1. Lack of Funding to Explore Brand New Concepts

To  mitigate  this  barrier,  DRI  created  a  small  ($25,000)  and  limited  (one-year)
research grants to investigate and test new ideas.

2. Lack  of  Functional  Requirements,  Specifications,  and  Evaluation  Cri-

teria
To mitigate this barrier, DRI commissioned the California Center for Innovative
Transportation  (CCIT)  at  UC–Berkeley  to  perform  an  evaluation  and  that  also
performed a supplemental evaluation using comparable criteria.

3. Lack of Provider Credibility

To mitigate this barrier, DRI assured end-users that Sensys was a reliable prod-
uct backed not only by the manufacture but also approved by Caltrans.

4. Resistance to Change and Risk Aversion

To  mitigate  this  barrier,  proactive  communication  was  pursued  through  reports
and informal discussions. DRI recruited champions at Caltrans’ Division of Traf-
fic Operations who sanctioned the testing.

5. Sole-sourcing Contracts

To mitigate this barrier, DRI had relied on performance-based specifications.

Lessons Learned

Caltrans has learned several important lessons in this case.

1. Logical  Evaluation  Criteria  must  be  established  in  a  Timely  Fashion  to
Evaluate  New  Products.  Customer-approved  key  performance  indicators  must
be  identified  and  performance  must  be  measured  with  reasonable  resources.  It
was learned that, in order to establish credibility, testing performance standards
for  new  products  should  be  as  rigorous  as  or  more  rigorous  than  performance
standards for existing products.

2. Using  a  Systems  Engineering  Approach  is  Necessary.  Using  principles  of
systems  engineering,  functional  requirements  should  have  been  specified  and
used  instead  of  promotional  product  descriptions.  In  all  cases,  a  company  trying
to meet the client’s requirements must clearly understand the process for getting
the product approved for use by the client (12).

3. Intellectual  Property  (IP)  can  be  Handled  through  the  University  Sys-
tem.  Intellectual  property  was  not  an  issue  with  this  innovation  because  the  IP
was handled through the University of California’s IP licensing process. Nonethe-
less, this required a substantial effort by Caltrans to get the approval of the Cali-
fornia Department of General Services to allow the University to own the IP de-
veloped by the University research that was funded by Caltrans.

4. Innovation  needs  Champions.  The  importance  of  innovation  champions  was
a  critical  factor  for  the  successful  deployment  of  Sensys.  Professor  Varaiya,  in-
ventor  of  Sensys  at  UC–Berkeley,  believes  that  acceptance  of  Sensys  in  Cali-
fornia by Caltrans will establish confidence in Sensys and pave the way for other
markets to deploy the product (15).

II. RAPID REHAB (CA4PRS) CASE STUDY

Rapid Rehab is described previously under Question 1 as part of the LLPRS pro-

gram.

CA4PRS Roadblocks

The  AASHTO  Technology  Implementation  Group  in  2006  designated  CA4PRS  as
a ‘‘priority technology.’’ Despite this and the fact that CA4PRS proved to be a valu-
able time and money saving innovation, it had its share of roadblocks. CA4PRs was
developed  outside  of  the  normal  Caltrans  Information  Technology  (IT)  development
process using a Transportation Pooled Fund project with the States of Washington,
Minnesota, and Texas participating in the pooled fund effort.
1. Compliance with Caltrans IT Standards. In order for CA4PRS to be accepted
and  allowed  by  Caltrans  IT  to  become  standard  Caltrans  software  (and  for
Caltrans users to install it on their computers), an extensive benefit-cost analysis
justifying  the  acquisition  of  the  software  for  Caltrans  had  to  be  conducted  and
an  extensive  and  cumbersome  Feasibility  Study  Report  (FSR)  had  to  be  com-
pleted.  Completing  the  FSR  for  CA4PRS  was  extremely  time-consuming,  com-
plicated, difficult, and frustrating process.
Soon after the CA4PRS FSR was completed and after CA4PRS was incorporated
into  Caltrans  Technology  Standards  list,  a  new  deployment  roadblock  emerged.
CA4PRS software needs to be installed on each engineer’s computer individually.
According  to  Caltrans  IT  protocols,  individual  installation  of  software  requires
the  work  to  be  performed  by  Caltrans  IT  staff.  Caltrans’  IT  staff  was  not  able
to  perform  the  installation  work  in  a  timely  manner  for  the  many  users.  As  a
result, many engineers gave up on using CA4PRS altogether.

2. Need  to  Learn  How  to  Market  New  Technologies.  Marketing  of  technology
is  critical  for  its  success  because  often  the  information  is  available,  but  it  re-
quires  too  much  effort  to  find.  Marketing  successful  results  of  research  by  going
out  to  the  customers  is  a  proactive  approach  that  Caltrans  has  used  to  ‘‘push’’
this  technology  out  to  users.  Caltrans  has  learned  that  producing  a  report  that
resides on a web page or in a library is not an effective way to deploy innovation.
3. Resistance  to  Change  and  Breakdown  in  Bottom-up  Communications.
Public  institutions  prefer  stability  and  routine  and  are  resistant  to  change.
Caltrans had to be proactive in pushing the new technology. DRI used champions
at  staff  and  management  levels  throughout  all  stages  of  deployment  to  dem-
onstrate the merit of this software. Briefings were provided to key decision-mak-
ers to support this innovation.

4. Lack  of  Profit  Motive.  It  was  necessary  to  demonstrate  the  concrete  benefits
of Rapid Rehab to Caltrans staff as well as private contractors. Establishing the
savings  in  support  costs  is  very  important  to  Capital  Outlay  Support  managers,
and  this  information  helped  make  decisions  that  supported  the  use  of  CA4PRS.
Construction  and  traveler  delay  cost  and  savings  were  documented  and  shown
to benefit Caltrans, the contractors, and the general public.

5. Risk  Aversion  and  the  Need  to  Establish  Credibility  for  New  Products.
Seeking national and international recognition for innovative research is a strat-
egy  that  DRI  has  used  to  build  credibility  for  CA4PRS  within  Caltrans  at  man-
agement and staff levels. In 2007, CA4PRS was nominated and earned the Inter-
national Road Federation Global Road Achievement Award for the Research Cat-
egory. CA4PRS is also included on the FHWA Priority Market-Ready Technology
list.  DRI  used  CA4PRS  in  pilot  studies  that  demonstrated  its  success.  DRI  won
credibility  for  CA4PRS  through  winning  national  and  international  recognition.
6.• Software  Licensing  Issues.  The  University  of  California  has  established  a
cost of $150,000 for all states to be allowed exclusive rights to use CA4PRS. The
current  cost  for  a  state  to  purchase  a  CA4PRS  enterprise  license  is  $5,000,
which is relatively inexpensive. Nonetheless, many states were unable to get the
approval  from  their  own  IT  departments  to  acquire  the  software  for  reasons
similar  to  the  Caltrans  experience.  To  alleviate  the  financial  burden  that  other
states may have in acquiring CA4PRS, Caltrans took the initiative and has been
working with FHWA to assist other State DOTs in the purchase of the licensing
rights through the Highways for Life Program.

7. Need  for  User  Training.  Finally,  lack  of  training  is  an  impediment  to  using
CA4PRS.  Therefore,  Caltrans,  in  cooperation  with  UC–Berkeley,  has  established
a training curriculum. So far over 700 people have been trained to use CA4PRS.
This includes approximately 100 users from other states.

Lessons Learned

The most important lesson learned includes the needs to do each of the following:
1. Be  flexible  and  resourceful.  Although  the  FSR  was  difficult  to  do,  DRI  used

it to as a way to document the benefits and costs of CA4PRS.

2. Manage product licensing.
3. Demonstrate the value of innovation.
4. Have innovation champions.
5. Minimize  implementation  cost.  Caltrans  used  Highways  for  Life  Program  to

help other states purchase CA4PRS.

6. Train  users  professionally.  It  was  learned  that  without  a  curriculum  and

training plan, this innovation would not be used.

III. BALSI BEAM CASE STUDY

Protecting  the  safety  of  construction  and  maintenance  field  crews  and  motorists
on roadways has long been a top priority for Caltrans. More than 40,000 people are
injured each year in the United States of America as a result of motor vehicle crash-
es  in  work  zones.  Fatalities  from  work  zone  crashes  have  increased  by  more  than
50 percent between 1999 and 2004 (19). In 2004, the cost of a fatality was estimated
to be $1,011,000. The cost of a critical injury was estimated to be $858,000 (20).

Balsi  Beam  is  an  innovative  mobile  work  zone  protection  system  that  was  envi-
sioned  by  Caltrans  Division  of  Maintenance  staff.  The  Balsi  Beam  is  named  after
Mark  Balsi,  a  Caltrans  landscape  worker  who  suffered  major  injuries  when  he  was
working  along  Interstate  280  in  Santa  Clara  County,  California  in  January  2001.
The  Balsi  Beam  system  is  basically  a  tractor-trailer  combination,  with  a  special-
ized trailer that extends into a thirty-foot long work space in between the rear axles
and  tractor,  shielded  on  one  side  with  two  steel  beams’’  (21).  The  trailer  provides
an  extendable  steel  barrier  to  protect  workers  on  traffic-exposed  flank  of  a  work
zone.

The  Balsi  Beam  was  designed  and  built  by  Caltrans’  Division  of  Equipment.  The
Caltrans  bridge  crews  utilized  the  Balsi  Beam  to  protect  their  workers.  The  Balsi
Beam  would  not  be  deployed  today  without  the  support  of  the  bridge  crew  from
Caltrans district staff Marysville, California.

Balsi Beam Roadblocks

The deployment of Balsi Beam has faced several technical, logistical, and institu-

tional roadblocks that included the following:
1. Lack  of  an  Established  Evaluation  Criteria  and  Customers’  Uncertainty
about  the  Effectiveness  of  Balsi  Beam.  It  is  difficult  to  get  maintenance
crews  to  use  a  new  product  like  the  Balsi  Beam.  In  the  opinion  of  the  inventor,
Balsi  Beam  is  not  ready  for  national  deployment  because  it  is  still  a  prototype.
In her opinion, Balsi Beam will prove its effectiveness when it is actually hit and
saves lives (22).

2. Customers’ Lack of Familiarity with Balsi Beam Capabilities. The complex
logistics  of  introducing  a  new  tool  into  existing  processes  at  Caltrans  made  the
deployment  of  this  innovation  difficult.  Demonstrations  by  the  crew  using  the
Balsi  Beam  helped  get  the  word  out  to  the  maintenance  community.  Having
champions  at  all  levels  to  support  the  Balsi  Beam  is  critical  for  the  success  of
implementing  this  innovation.  Training  needs  to  be  developed  by  maintenance
personnel  as  hands-on  training  for  crews  to  be  able  to  operate  the  Balsi  Beam.
3. Lack of a Business Case for Commercializing Balsi Beam. Balsi Beam has
strong  business  (and  safety)  case  but  documenting  such  an  innovation  case  for
commercialization  was  a  new  process  for  Caltrans.  Documenting  the  business
case  for  the  Balsi  Beam  was  essential  for  getting  additional  resources  to  pur-
chase additional units through the Budget Change Proposal process at Caltrans.
Documenting the business case not only yielded a solid and presentable business
case,  but  also  during  the  process  itself,  stronger  links  were  established  between
champions at all levels for this innovative system from regular highway mainte-
nance workers to the Chief for the Division of Maintenance at Caltrans, District
Director for District 3 (in Sacramento), and Caltrans Chief Deputy Director. This
made  the  case  stronger  to  implement  the  Balsi  Beam.  Establishing  the  business
case using worker safety data and in-field evaluations helped to overcome the in-
stitutional  issues.  DRI  commissioned  CCIT  to  perform  an  evaluation.  Finally,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:26 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047544 PO 00000 Frm 00132 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\T&I09\021209\47544 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

125

DRI funded research at UC–Davis to perform benefit-cost analysis and risk eval-
uation study.
A  consultant  was  hired  to  help  DRI  establish  a  process  to  sell  the  licenses  to
vendors to produce units for other states. Two goals of commercializing the Balsi
Beam  were  to  improve  the  product  design  and  to  reduce  the  costs  and  time  to
produce the units.

4. Legal  Restrictions.  One  way  for  Caltrans  to  share  this  innovation  with  other
states would have been to ‘‘gift’’ the license to other states or venders. However,
California law prohibits Caltrans from doing so. Article XVI § 6 of California Con-
stitution prohibits any public agency from making ‘‘any gift of any public money
or  thing  of  value  to  any  individual,  municipal  or  other  corporation  whatever’’
(23).  As  a  result,  DRI  has  developed  licenses  to  allow  other  states  to  purchase
the  right  to  use  Balsi  Beam  through  license  agreements.  DRI  will  be  issuing  an
RFP to sell Balsi Beam licenses to multiple qualified vendors.

5. High  Capital  Cost.  A  major  obstacle  for  getting  the  approval  to  deploy  addi-
tional  Balsi  Beam  units  has  been  its  high  capital  cost.  The  capital  cost  of  the
original  prototype  unit  was  $257,000.  Capital  cost  for  a  new,  fully  operational
unit  is  estimated  to  be  as  high  as  $600,000–700,000.  Increases  in  the  price  of
steel,  complex  system  requirements,  and  potential  liabilities  are  behind  the  cost
increases.  High  capital  cost  has  become  a  barrier  to  deploying  Balsi  Beam  at
Caltrans  and  to  marketing  it  to  other  State  DOTs.  DRI  is  using  commercializa-
tion to reduce capital cost by improving the design and optimizing manufacturing
procedures  as  well  as  mass-producing  the  units  to  domestic  and  international
customers.  Concerned  about  its  high  cost,  the  California  Department  of  Finance
asked  Caltrans  to  evaluate  other  less  expensive  mobile  work  zone  protection  de-
vices.  Caltrans  will  purchase  an  additional  three  Balsi  Beams  units  and  three
ArmorGuardΤΜ units.  This  study  suggests  that  one  way  to  reduce  the  high  cap-
ital  cost  is  to  optimize  Balsi  Beam  design  and  its  manufacturing  processes.  An-
other way is to mass-produce the system, which spreads the fixed manufacturing
costs  over  larger  number  of  units  by  marketing  it  to  other  State  agencies  and
overseas.

6. Intellectual  Property  Constraints.  The  patent  and  resulting  Intellectual
Property license for the Balsi Beam is an important discussion point that relates
to  implementing  innovation.  Almost  all  states  have  competitive  bidding  require-
ments  to  assure  that  they  get  the  lowest  price  for  the  products  they  buy.  CCIT
conducted a study to analyze problems related to intellectual property and licens-
ing of the Balsi Beam and concluded that Caltrans may have hampered the mar-
keting  of  Balsi  Beam  by  patenting  it  (12).  This  same  study  concluded  that  if  a
patent  or  licensed  product  requires  exclusive,  non-competitive  bid,  government
entities  might  not  be  able  to  purchase  the  product  because  of  the  restrictions
placed on non-competitive bids.

7. Uncertainty about a Fair Market Value for Balsi Beam. Uncertainty in de-
termining  a  fair  market  value  for  Balsi  Beam  has  been  a  financial  stumbling
block facing the implementation of this innovation. An agreement with the State
of  New  York  was  held  up  for  about  one  year  waiting  for  the  license  to  be  devel-
oped  and  approved.  In  an  effort  to  solve  this  problem,  DRI  commissioned  CCIT
in  2007  to  conduct  a  study  to  estimate  a  market  value  for  Balsi  Beam  license.
CCIT  concluded  that  a  fair  market  value  for  the  license  would  be  $2.6  million.
The study further assumed that there is demand for 136 units that could be mar-
keted  eventually.  Thus,  the  license  cost  per  unit  would  $19,000  per  unit  (12).
Fair  market  value  is  critical  for  establishing  that  Caltrans  gets  a  reasonable
compensation for the Intellectual Property and for complying with the State Con-
stitution that prevents gifts of public resources.

Lessons Learned

This case study illustrates the importance of several lessons learned including the

need for all of the following:
1. Creating champions at all levels of the organization from the crew level
to top management. Getting to this stage in the deployment of innovation has
taken  considerable  time  and  dedication  on  part  of  champions  at  all  levels  in  the
organization.

2. Carefully Managing Intellectual Property Rights. Intellectual Property was
a  significant  issue  with  the  deployment  of  the  Balsi  Beam.  It  is  different  than
the other two case studies because Caltrans owns the patent for the Balsi Beam.

Developing  standard  license  agreements  for  use  by  other  states  and  providing  a
market  assessment  were  effective  in  overcoming  the  IP  roadblocks.  Caltrans  is
very close to issuing RFP to sell the licenses to vendors who will allow other po-
tential customers to purchase Balsi Beam through commercial channels.

3. Optimizing Manufacturing and Production of Balsi Beam. Commercializa-
tion  should  optimize  Balsi  Beam  design  and  manufacturing  process  and  lower
production cost. Mass production is also expected to lower unit cost.

4. Marketing.  Marketing  the  Balsi  Beam  across  the  country  has  helped  to  gain
credibility  within  California  by  proving  that  this  technology  is  unique  for  the
purpose  of  obtaining  resources  to  purchase  additional  units.  In  June  2004,
Caltrans  sent  the  Balsi  Beam  across  the  Nation  on  a  multi-state  tour  with  the
final destination being a demonstration for the AASHTO Standing Committee on
Maintenance. Caltrans also marketed the Balsi Beam through many FHWA pub-
lications and by adding the Balsi Beam to the AASHTO Technology Implementa-
tion Group (TIG).

QUESTION  3.How  can  the  Federal  Government  ensure  that  State,  county,
and city decision-makers make informed decisions (i.e., Local
Technical Assistance Program, LTAP)?

Need to Train Next Generation Workforce

Over  the  next  10  years,  nearly  half  the  current  transportation  workforce  will  be
eligible  to  retire—it’s  even  more  crucial  than  ever  that  we  provide  technical  assist-
ance  and  training  programs.  Tomorrow’s  decision-makers  are  likely  today’s  young
professionals.  If  they  stop  learning  when  they  leave  college,  their  training  may  be
20 years behind them by the time they are leading their agency. As technology and
processes change, we need to ensure today’s decision-makers are using today’s tools,
not what they learned in school 20 years ago.

LTAP  Centers  (the  California  center  and  58  other  centers  across  the  country)  al-
ready  support  the  Federal  Government  objectives  by  getting  training  and  informa-
tion out to State, regional, local agencies in the following ways:
• Over  the  past  10  years,  LTAP/TTAP  centers  have  provided  training  to  over
200,000  State  DOT  employees,  helping  to  increase  their  knowledge  and  pro-
ficiency. More than half of this training is focused on Highway and Worker Safety.
• Each year more than 40,000 DOT staff use the LTAP/TTAP technical newsletters

as a source of timely transportation related information.

• LTAP  Centers  are  assisting  in  the  Strategic  Highway  Safety  Improvement  Plan
development process through their participation on many statewide advisory com-
mittees including Roadway Safety, Bike/Pedestrian, Work Zone Safety and Driver
Behavior committees.

• Partnerships  between  State  DOTs,  the  Federal  Highway  Administration,  and  the
Local  Technical  Assistance  Program  have  developed  Safety  Circuit  Rider  pro-
grams to help reduce the number of fatalities on rural roads.

• LTAP Centers are administering their State High Risk Rural Road Programs, in-

programs.

cluding conducting the field reviews for local agencies.

• LTAP  Centers  are  conducting  the  Safe  Routes  to  School  Educational  Outreach

• LTAP  Center  staff  has  coordinated  national,  regional,  and  statewide  transpor-
tation  conferences  including  the  Transportation  Asset  Management  Conference,
the  AASHTO  Research  Advisory  Committee  Meetings,  Winter  Maintenance  Sym-
posiums,  Pavement  Preservation  Conferences,  Rail  Corridor  Safety  Conferences,
and many others.

• Partnerships  with  State  DOTs  on  new  local  road  safety  programs  have  helped  to
provide  training,  technical  assistance  and  funding  for  local  road  improvement
projects.

• State Transportation Librarians, working closely with LTAP Librarians, have cre-
ated  customized  search  tools  using  Google  that  include  all  State  DOTs  and  all
university  transportation  center  libraries  and  provided  materials  to  State  and
local agencies that those employees would not otherwise have access to.

• LTAP  Centers  are  vital  for  delivering  critical  training  to  county  engineers,  high-
way  superintendents  and  local  road  professionals  in  each  state.  Over  the  past  10
years, over 1.5 million local transportation professionals attended the LTAP/TTAP
training.

‘‘It  would  be  hard  to  find  a  program  in  the  Federal  Government  that  touches  as
many  people  and  fosters  such  success  as  LTAP  and  TTAP’’  says  Joe  Toole,  former
FHWA’s Associate Administrator for the Office of Professional and Corporate Devel-
opment and now Associate Administrator for FHWA’s Office of Safety.

Over the past 10 years, LTAP Centers have:
• Conducted more than 60,000 training events,
• Provided more than nine million hours of training,
• Reached  over  1.5  transportation  professionals/practitioners  in  those  classrooms,
• Distributed over two million technical publications, and
• Saved  local  transportation  agencies  an  estimated  $8  for  every  $1  LTAP  spent  on

nearly half of all training content relates to highway and worker safety,

information and training.

National Cooperative Highway Research Program

The  National  Cooperative  Highway  Research  Program  (NCHRP)  was  created  as
a  means  to  conduct  research  in  acute  problem  areas  that  affect  highway  planning,
design, construction, operation, and maintenance nationwide. NCHRP is a voluntary
program  created  by  agreement  between  AASHTO,  FHWA,  and  member  States  and
administered by the TRB.

Caltrans  values  the  research  produced  through  the  NCHRP  program.  Caltrans
contributes $3.5 million each year to NCHRP. In 2008, 54 projects were selected for
funding  of  which  37  were  a  high  priority  for  Caltrans.  Of  the  171  projects  selected
over  the  past  three  years,  Caltrans  has  over  50  members  serving  on  project  panels
guiding  the  research.  The  strength  of  the  NCHRP  research  projects  is  in  how  they
are developed and supported, usually by TRB or AASHTO committees, and how the
research is pursued through panels that represent the users/customers to make sure
the  research  is  meaningful.  This  model  is  very  similar  to  how  the  SHRP  2  was  de-
veloped  through  direct  involvement  from  transportation  stakeholders  and  practi-
tioners. A recent TRB project Communicating the Value of Research objective to de-
velop  a  guide  for  successfully  communicating  the  value  of  transportation  research
projects  and  programs  is  a  good  example  of  the  type  of  research  that  is  pursued  at
the request of the transportation community.
QUESTION 4. Is the current workforce capable of implementing advanced

highway technologies?

The challenge of implementing advanced highway technologies is more an institu-
tional  issue.  The  employees  of  today  are  very  capable  of  taking  on  the  new  chal-
lenges of advance highway technologies. What they are lacking are the tools to bring
new  technologies  into  their  environments  to  make  changes  that  will  improve  the
products and services that are provided to the transportation system customers.

In order for the workforce to implement innovations they need to have the ‘‘right
stuff’’ to overcome the many institutional and organizational barriers. One basic re-
quirement  that  most  advanced  technologies  have  difficulty  overcoming  is  to  estab-
lish  a  business  case  that  can  be  approved  through  the  financial  institutions.  Pro-
viding  product  specifications  and  training  are  requirements  that  often  are  not  met.
The  innovation  system  is  designed  to  create  new  ideas,  not  to  implement  them.  At
Caltrans,  we  have  dedicated  resources  to  deploying  research  results  by  forming  a
four-member deployment branch. We have also established the California Center for
Innovative Transportation to assist with deployment of research products and serv-
ices.

Innovation Survey

Transportation  innovation  information  can  help  provide  insights  into  what  our
current  staff  thinks  about  innovation  and  what  we  should  do  to  encourage  them  to
innovate.  DRI  conducted  a  pilot  survey  in  an  attempt  to  help  answer  the  following
research  innovation  questions.  The  following  survey  was  sent  to  150  transportation
research professionals in California, research executives in the other 49 State DOTs,
and some in Canada:
1. Should focus be on sustaining (evolutionary) or disrupting (revolutionary) innova-

tion?

2. What  are  the  most  common  roadblocks  facing  the  implementation  of  innovation

in transportation?

3. What are most common enablers of the innovation process?

4. Prioritize the importance of innovation in safety, performance, cost-effectiveness,

quality, and environmental protection.

5. How  can  we  facilitate  the  process  of  implementing  innovation  at  Caltrans  and

other State DOTs?

Survey Instrument

The  survey  consisted  of  ten  questions  used  to  test  our  assumptions  ‘‘hypothesis’’
regarding  the  existence  of  the  above  barriers  and  enablers.  Respondents  completed
109 ‘‘usable’’ surveys. The survey asked respondents the following:
• Rate the importance of each roadblock and enabler.
• State if they prefer sustaining or disruptive technologies.
• Prioritize  which  innovations,  safety,  performance,  cost-effectiveness,  quality,  and
• Provide their suggestions for improving the innovation process.

environmental protection, are most important.

Survey Results
1. About  79  percent  of  respondents  indicated  that  innovation  is  ‘‘very  important,’’

20 percent indicated it is ‘‘important.’’

2. About  62  percent  of  respondents  thought  ‘‘sustaining’’  (evolutionary)  tech-
nologies  are  more  important  than  ‘‘disruptive’’  (revolutionary)  technologies.
However,  73  percent  of  academic  respondents  believed  the  other  way  around.
3. Safety was the top priority for non-academic respondents with an average score

of 4.1/5.0.

4. Academic researchers indicated they are most interested in performance innova-

tions, followed by quality.

5. About  63  percent  of  respondents  considered  themselves  innovation  champions.
6. About 42 percent of respondents are decision-makers.
7. About  40  percent  of  respondents  are  potential  implementers  of  technological  in-

novations.
‘‘Resistance  to  Change’’  was  voted  by  both  Caltrans  practitioners  and  academic
researchers  as  the  most  serious  roadblock  to  innovation  (researchers  scored  it
4.8/5.0, Caltrans participants scored it 4.6/5.0).
Innovation  enablers  ‘‘Product  matches  user  needs’’  received  a  score  of  4.6/5.0;
‘‘User/customer  participation’’  received  a  score  of  4.5/5.0;  and  ‘‘Successful  pilot
projects’’ received a score of 4.4/5.0.

8.

9.

10. Both Caltrans practitioners and academic researchers view ‘‘lack of political will
to  take  on  challenge’’  as  the  most  serious  institutional  barrier  to  innovation,
with researchers thinking it is more serious and rating this barrier 4.7 on aver-
age as compared with Caltrans group, who rated it 4.3 on average.

IMPROVING TRANSPORTATION INNOVATION IMPLEMENTATION
1. Establish clear direction and procedures for the innovation process

A  vast  number  of  respondent  comments  focused  on  the  need  to  establish  clear
direction  and  procedures  for  the  innovation  process,  including  clear  objectives
and precise performance measures to evaluate success.
One respondent stressed the importance to define what is ‘‘new’’ and what is ‘‘in-
novative.’’  Another  said  clear  procedures  should  be  created  for  implementations
and marketing, and some respondents recommended to make pilot projects part
of  the  implementation  process.  Frustration  with  bureaucracy  was  evident.  The
innovation  process  should  be  streamlined  so  that  there  are  fewer  barriers  hold-
ing up innovation. ‘‘The FSR [Feasibility Study Report required for implementa-
tion of innovations at Caltrans] process and requirements are mind-boggling and
in  need  of  streamlining  as  well.’’  Executive  leaders  must  ‘‘institutionalize’’  the
culture  of  encouraging  innovation  by  integrating  it  into  work  plans  and  incor-
porating  it  into  the  regular  performance  evaluations  of  the  organization  and  its
managers. One respondent’s experience is that most innovations stop at the rec-
ommendations level in government and there are not good implementation plans
to  carry  out  the  recommendations  make  them  permanent  or  institutional.  The
same respondent further cautioned that ‘‘Too often things are attached to a per-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:26 Aug 30, 2009 Jkt 047544 PO 00000 Frm 00136 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\T&I09\021209\47544 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

129

son and when that person moves on and so does the innovation.’’ The implemen-
tation of innovation should be mandated in order to carry innovation to fruition.

2. Improve communications

One  respondent  emphasized  ‘‘Communicate,  communicate,  and  communicate.’’
Make  sure  that  everyone  with  an  interest  in  the  potential  innovation  gets  a
chance  to  provide  input  and  to  question.  A  university  research  executive  sug-
gested  connecting  the  organization  [say  Caltrans]  more  closely  with  researchers
and  innovators.  A  project  manager  would  mandate  customer  participation  in
project progress and meetings.

3. Secure executive sponsorship and management support

There  was  a  universal  consensus  that  strong  management  support  for  innova-
tion is indispensable. ‘‘There is no substitute for leadership with vision and prac-
tical,  focused  follow-through,’’  one  respondent  wrote.  Innovation  begins  with  ex-
ecutive-level  commitment  and  development  of  a  work  environment  that  em-
braces  innovation.  Upper  management  support  and  encouragement  is  required.
Innovation needs strong executive support & successful pilots/demos. There is a
need  for  strong  executive  mandate  and  adequate  funding  of  demonstration  pro-
grams. While executive-level support is important, they need to leave the imple-
mentation  to  the  experts.  Leaders  should  lead,  not  manage.  Finally,  top  leader-
ship has to make innovation a priority and then hold people accountable.

4. Empower people and find champions for each innovative idea/project

Innovation  champions  are  needed  in  the  innovation  policy  and  procedures  area.
Otherwise,  innovations  will  fall  flat  or  will  not  reach  full  potential.  Many  re-
spondents  suggested  that  research  staff  ‘‘needs  to  be  empowered  to  accomplish
innovation.’’  It  is  necessary  to  have  champions  at  high-levels  in  order  to  create
a  culture  for  innovation  in  an  organization  as  well  as  product-level  champions
to overcome resistance to change. A university professor and a director of a uni-
versity transportation center said: ‘‘Give people some freedom to try new things’’.
A  Caltrans  project  manager  suggested  giving  ownership  of  each  innovation
project  to  a  small  team  with  management  backing.  One  respondent  pointed  out
the  role  of  the  individual  in  innovation  and  cautioned  that,  ‘‘if  the  person  who
is  championing  the  change  is  not  liked  in  the  organization,  the  change  may  be
overlooked.’’

5. Create incentives for innovators

Many respondents argued for increasing opportunities for innovative ideas. Both
university  researchers  and  project  managers  advocated  creating  incentives.
‘‘More  ideas  portend  higher  probability  of  innovation  which  may  be  imple-
mented,’’  said  a  university  researcher.  A  senior  electronics  engineer  would  re-
ward  innovators  and  reward  those  in  management  who  are  willing  to  take  rea-
sonable  risk  when  the  potential  advance  is  significant.  A  senior  transportation
engineer  would  encourage  more  innovative  research  work  by  staff  by  reducing
administrative workload demands.

6. Demonstrate the benefits of innovation

Many  respondents  emphasized  the  importance  of  ensuring  that  end-users  have
clear  understanding  of  the  advantage  of  innovation.  The  benefits  of  the  concept
must  be  proven  to  satisfy  the  real  user  needs.  Innovation  advocates  and  end-
users must have clear understanding of the problem and value added by innova-
tion.  The  importance  of  an  innovation  must  be  clarified  up  front  to  all  stake-
holders. Case studies should be used to show how other State agencies have im-
plemented an innovation and show how it has improved their business.

7. Manage risk and change

Surprisingly, many respondents with executive authority confronted the need to
take reasonable risk head on. One asked to ‘‘demystify risk’’ because sometimes
‘‘it  is  riskier  not  to  act.’’  Another  said  one  must  ‘‘accept  certain  amount  of  risk
to  compensate  for  high  payoff.’’  One  acknowledged  that  the  core  issue  is  the
‘‘risk-averse culture,’’ the general lack of positive reinforcement to try something
new, and the ‘‘penalties’’ if you break the mold and fail. One executive cautioned,
however,  to  be  realistic  and  not  expect  the  organization  to  always  absorb  the
cost/effort to innovate. One respondent believed that people, users, and even in-
stitutions  that  normally  are  reluctant  to  change  would  eventually  welcome
‘‘good’’ changes that make life easier.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Respondents  recommended  seven  major  actions  to  develop  a  workforce  that  can
implement innovations that will make new or advanced technologies a commonplace
reality:
1. Establish clear direction and procedures for the innovation process,
2. Improve communications,
3. Secure executive sponsorship and management support,
4. Empower employees and find champions for each innovation,
5. Create incentives for innovators,
6. Demonstrate the benefits of innovation, and
7. Manage risk and change.

Finally,  the  research  showed  that  ‘‘resistance  to  change’’  and  ‘‘lack  of  political
will’’  are  among  the  most  serious  barriers  to  innovation.  The  highest-rated  enabler
of innovation was ‘‘product matched user need.’’ It was also evident that innovation,
whether  disruptive  or  sustaining,  requires  champions  of  innovation  at  all  levels  of
the  organization  to  be  successful.  It  was  evident  that  managing  risk  and  change  is
critical  for  the  success  of  innovation.  In  the  public  sector,  most  failures  are  highly
publicized and criticized. A single innovation failure can outstand, outtalk, and over-
shadow  dozens  of  successful  ones.  Therefore,  creating  the  ability  to  take  calculated
reasonable risks is required at all public agencies in the transportation sector.

STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS

An Overview of Transportation Research and
Development: Priorities for Reauthorization

The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 1 is pleased to submit this State-
ment  for  the  Record  of  the  February  12  hearing  held  by  the  United  States  House
of  Representatives,  Subcommittee  on  Technology  and  Innovation,  Committee  on
Science and Technology: An Overview of Transportation Research and Development:
Priorities for Reauthorization.

America’s  surface  transportation  system  is  broken.  ASCE’s  2009  Report  Card  for
America’s  Infrastructure,  released  in  January,  graded  the  Nation’s  Roads  a  D-;
Bridges a C; Transit a D; and Rail a grade of C-.

Among  the  key  findings  are  the  following.  In  2007,  41,059  people  were  killed  in
motor  vehicle  crashes  and  2,491,000  were  injured.  Motor  vehicle  crashes  cost  the
U.S. $230 billion per year—$819 for each resident in medical costs, lost productivity
and travel delays. Americans spend 4.2 billion hours a year stuck in traffic at a cost
of $78.2 billion a year—$710 per motorist. Roadway conditions are a significant fac-
tor  in  about  one-third  of  traffic  fatalities  and  poor  road  conditions  cost  U.S.  motor-
ists  $67  billion  a  year  in  repairs  and  operating  costs—$333  per  motorist.  One-third
of  America’s  major  roads  are  in  poor  or  mediocre  condition  and  36  percent  of  the
Nation’s major urban highways are congested.

More  than  26  percent  of  the  Nation’s  bridges  are  either  structurally  deficient  or
functionally  obsolete  and  the  number  of  deficient  bridges  in  urban  areas  is  on  the
rise.  While  demand  for  public  transit  is  increasing,  only  about  half  of  American
households  have  access  to  bus  or  rail  transit  and  only  25  percent  consider  it  to  be
a good option. Because freight and passenger rail generally share the same network,
any  significant  increase  in  passenger  rail  demand  will  exacerbate  freight  railroad
capacity challenges.

To compete in the global economy, improve our quality of life, and raise our stand-
ard  of  living,  we  must  rebuild  and  update  America’s  surface  transportation  infra-
structure. America’s 21st century surface transportation system must be founded on
a new paradigm based on a comprehensive, holistic, multi-modal approach utilizing
integrated, effective, inter-modal, sustainable, cost effective solutions. Only then will
America have a surface transportation system that is unparalleled in its safety, se-
curity, efficiency and effectiveness.

As  Congress  works  to  develop  the  2009  Authorization  of  the  Surface  Transpor-
tation  Program,  it  must  remain  cognizant  that  it  can  no  longer  focus  only  on  the
movement  of  cars  and  trucks  from  one  place  to  another.  Rather,  the  new  paradigm
must  be  based  on  moving  people,  goods  and  services  across  the  country.  This  new
vision must be inter-modal and deal with the possible effects of climate change; land
use,  sustainability,  and  the  anticipated  changes  in  the  population’s  demographics,
particularly age and urbanization.

ASCE  supports  the  vision  of  a  national  inter-modal  transportation  system  which
is  economically  efficient,  environmentally  sound,  provides  the  foundation  for  U.S.
businesses to compete globally and moves people and freight in an efficient manner.
Developing  and  deploying  new  technologies  and  cutting-edge  solutions  will  require
input  from  stakeholders  in  the  public,  private,  and  academic  sectors,  and  accom-
plishing a truly inter-modal system will require partnerships among Federal, State,
local  and  regional  government  authorities  as  well  as  citizen  groups  and  the  private
sector.

Research  and  technology  (R&T)  are  critical  to  achieving  transportation  goals  in:
infrastructure  performance  and  preservation;  safety;  quality  of  life;  economic  pros-
perity;  environmental  impacts;  and  sustainability  and  security  . . .  and  technology
transfer  activities  are  critical  to  the  successful  implementation  of  research  results.
While  we  understand  that  in  the  current  economic  environment  it  may  be  difficult
to  increase  surface  transportation  research  and  development  funding,  at  a  min-
imum,  current  R&T  funding  levels  must  be  maintained  and  public-private  partner-
ships, where appropriate, should be fostered.

1 ASCE  was  founded  in  1852  and  is  the  country’s  oldest  national  civil  engineering  organiza-
tion.  It  represents  more  than  146,000  civil  engineers  individually  in  private  practice,  govern-
ment, industry, and academia who are dedicated to the advancement of the science and profes-
sion  of  civil  engineering.  ASCE  is  a  non-profit  educational  and  professional  society  organized

The  Highway  Trust  Fund  (HTF)  has  been  an  essential  source  of  funding  for  sur-
face  transportation  research  and  technology  for  decades,  and  research  results  have
led  to  many  benefits  including:  materials  that  improved  the  performance  of  pave-
ments and structures; design methods that reduce scour (and the consequent threat
of  collapse)  of  bridges;  intelligent  transportation  systems  technologies  that  improve
safety  and  reduce  travel  delay;  methods  and  materials  that  radically  improve  our
ability  to  keep  roads  safely  open  in  severe  winter  weather;  innovative  management
approaches  that  reduce  environmental  impacts  and  improve  the  cultural  aspects  of
transportation facilities; and many more.

One way to reduce the investment gap, that is, the difference between HTF reve-
nues  and  the  funding  needed  to  improve  the  surface  transportation  system,  is
through research, as research outcomes can improve the performance and durability
of  our  transportation  infrastructure,  resulting  in  reduced  operations  and  mainte-
nance  costs  and  less  frequent  replacement  of  infrastructure  elements.  The  Explor-
atory  Research  Program,  funded  in  SAFETEA–LU,  has  the  potential  to  be  the  lead
program in providing improved materials, designs, and processes that can transform
the performance of our surface transportation infrastructure.

The  ability  of  the  HTF  to  continue  to  serve  as  a  major  funding  source  for  trans-
portation  R&T  is  dependent  upon  the  continued  capability  of  the  Highway  Trust
Fund revenue sources to generate adequate levels of funding. The latest projections
indicate that Highway Trust Fund revenues will be insufficient to continue the 2009
SAFETEA–LU  authorized  levels  of  funding  in  2010.  The  result  will  be  not  only  re-
duced  investment  in  highway  and  transit  infrastructure,  but  also  reduced  invest-
ment  in  research.  To  avoid  reduced  investment,  Congress  will  need  to  address  this
problem  by  September  30,  2009.  While  in  the  short-term,  an  increase  in  user  fees
is clearly necessary, our national surface transportation policy must—in the longer-
term—move  toward  a  system  that  more  directly  aligns  fees  that  a  user  is  charged
with the benefits that the user derives. Appropriate policy research can help identify
solutions  to  the  funding  issue  and  what  methods  and  technologies  are  best  to  pro-
vide  revenue  to  the  HTF.  This  type  of  research  needs  to  be  funded  in  the  new  au-
thorization.

Other  research  programs  that  can  continue  to  contribute  to  the  improvement  of
the  highway  system  include  the  Federal  Highway  Administration’s  (FHWA)  pro-
gram, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) and State de-
partment of transportation programs funded largely through State Planning and Re-
search (SPR) funds. In the transit area, the main programs are those of the Federal
Transit  Administration  (FTA)  and  the  Transit  Cooperative  Research  Program
(TCRP).  ASCE  believes  that  the  University  Transportation  Centers  (UTC)  program
provides valuable research across most transportation modes.

Designated programs and earmarks in SAFETEA–LU resulted in an over designa-
tion  of  funding  in  the  research  title.  As  a  result,  the  FHWA  has  no  discretionary
research  funding,  causing  some  research  products  and  services  previously  provided
by FHWA to either be absorbed by State programs or to be discontinued altogether.
Some  of  the  earmarks  also  placed  additional  burdens  on  State  research  programs
when these programs were identified as sources of matching funds for the earmarks.
Therefore, as we go forward, we recommend that there be minimal earmarking and
that  free  and  open  competition  among  non-federal  entities  performing  research  uti-
lizing federal funds be promoted.

Within the context of the general principles set out above, ASCE supports the fol-

lowing actions regarding specific R&T programs:

• The  research  and  technology  portion  of  the  State  Planning  and  Research
(SPR)  program  should  be  maintained  to  help  support  state-specific  activities
while  continuing  to  encourage  the  states  to  pool  these  resources  to  address
matters of more general concern.
• University  research  should  continue  to  be  supported  through  the  University
Transportation  Centers  (UTC)  program  using  a  competitive  selection  process
that  guarantees  quality  participants  and  fairness  in  the  allocation  of  funds.
• The  Federal  Highway  Administration’s  (FHWA)  program  should  be  strength-
ened  by  giving  it  sufficient  funding  and  flexibility  to  implement  the  rec-
ommendations  of  TRB  Special  Report  261,  The  Federal  Role  in  Highway  Re-
search  and  Technology,  to  focus  on  fundamental,  long-term  research;  to  per-
form research on emerging national issues and on areas not addressed by oth-
ers; to engage stakeholders more consistently in their program; and to employ
open competition, merit review, and systematic evaluation of outcomes.
• A  continuation  of  the  Strategic  Highway  Research  Program  SHRP  II  beyond
the life of SAFETEA–LU, ensuring that critical research will be continued in
key areas of surface transportation.

• The  Federal  Transit  Administration’s  (FTA)  research  program  should  be
given  sufficient  funding  and  flexibility  to  work  with  its  stakeholders  to  de-
velop and pursue national transit research priorities.
• The  new  Research  and  Innovative  Technology  Administration  (RITA)  should
have a well-defined scope and responsibility and appropriate funding, in addi-
tion to currently authorized research funding, so that it may supplement and
support the R&T programs of the modal administrations.

We also encourage the Subcommittee to review the findings and recommendations
of  TRB  Special  Report  295,  ‘‘The  Federal  Investment  in  Highway  Research  2006–
2009, Strengths and Weaknesses.’’

While the Federal Government plays a relatively minor role in the ownership and
operations of the Nation’s highways, it plays a critical and indispensable role in the
research  and  innovation  process,  providing  about  two-thirds  of  the  total  amount
spent  on  highway  research  and  technology  projects.  It  also  plays  a  major  role  in
training and technology transfer, and has traditionally been the sole source for high-
er-risk, potentially higher pay-off research.

To bolster the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) capabilities to improve
research,  development,  technology  coordination  and  evaluation,  in  2004,  Congress
created  DOT’s  Research  and  Innovative  Technology  Administration  (RITA),  to  co-
ordinate  and  review  the  Department’s  programs  for  purposes  of  reducing  research
duplication, enhancing opportunities for joint efforts and ensuring that research, de-
velopment  and  technology  activities  are  meeting  their  objectives.  In  2006,  the  U.S.
Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  reported  that  while  RITA  had  made
progress  toward  these  ends,  more  needed  to  be  done.  Specifically,  GAO  noted  that
RITA  has  not  yet  developed  an  overall  strategy,  evaluation  plan,  or  performance
measures  which  delineate  how  its  activities  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  the  Depart-
ment’s research, development, technology investment. As a cost-effective coordinated
research,  development  and  technology  program  is  vital  to  creating  a  world  class,
21st century surface transportation program, we urge Congress to continue to mon-
itor RITA’s progress towards achieving these goals to ensure that the public receives
a maximum return on every dollar invested.

Rebuilding  America’s  transportation  infrastructure  is  a  critical  part  of  rebuilding
our  economy.  And  there  can  be  little  doubt  that  a  highly  focused  and  well  coordi-
nated  R&T  surface  transportation  investment  program  is  necessary  if  we  are  to
build a surface transportation system that is unparalleled in its safety, security, effi-
ciency  and  effectiveness,  one  which  provides  long-term  benefits  and  reinforces  the
economic foundation of our nation.

ASCE  looks  forward  to  working  with  the  Committee  to  create  a  strong  transpor-

tation research program in the next surface transportation authorization bill.
