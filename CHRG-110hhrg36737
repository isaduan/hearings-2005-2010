ment Accountability Office

Potential Issues

The following are some of the potential issues that might be raised at the hearing:
• What are the main challenges to successfully flying the Space Shuttle until its
planned 2010 retirement? How will NASA ensure the continued safety of Space
Shuttle  operations  in  the  face  of  an  ongoing  labor  strike,  workforce  transition
uncertainties,  competition  with  other  NASA  human  space  flight  programs  for
resources,  and  a  schedule  driven  by  the  need  to  complete  International  Space
Station (ISS) assembly by the planned 2010 retirement date of the Shuttle?

• What  are  the  main  challenges  to  successfully  completing  the  planned  Shuttle
mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope, and how firm is NASA’s launch
schedule for the Hubble servicing mission?

• What  are  the  main  risks  to  successfully  assembling  the  International  Space
Station (ISS) by the time the Shuttle is retired? What will NASA do if the ac-
tual  Shuttle  flight  rate  turns  out  to  be  insufficient  to  complete  all  of  the
planned  ISS  assembly  and  logistics  fights  by  the  end  of  2010,  and  what  will
be the impact on ISS utilization and operations?

• What  actions,  if  any,  is  NASA  taking  to  respond  to  the  findings  and  rec-
ommendations of the ISS Independent Safety Task Force that raised a number
of concerns about the program?

• Does  NASA  have  a  credible  logistics  plan  for  supporting  ISS  utilization  and
operations  once  the  Shuttle  is  retired,  and  does  that  plan  have  adequate
backup strategies for contingencies?

• What  does  NASA  want  to  do  with  the  ISS  once  it  is  assembled,  and  does
NASA  have  well  defined  utilization  plans  and  resource  commitments  in  place
that are aligned with those utilization objectives? Given the cuts to the micro-
gravity  research  community,  will  a  research  community  be  available  to  effec-
tively utilize the ISS once it is assembled?

• What  would  be  required  for  NASA’s  ISS  National  Laboratory  concept  to  be-
come  a  reality,  and  what  are  the  main  impediments  to  its  success?  What  will
NASA  do  with  the  unused  capacity  and  capabilities  of  the  ISS  if  other  agen-
cies decide not to make significant use of it?

BACKGROUND
Space Shuttle Program
Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Request for the Space Shuttle Program

The  FY08  budget  request  for  the  Space  Shuttle  program  is  $4.007  billion.  [A
multi-year funding chart for the Space Shuttle and ISS programs is included as an
attachment  to  this  memo.]  Funding  for  the  Space  Shuttle  program  is  used  to  pay
for the following:

(1) Program Integration—which includes flight software, system engineering,

construction of facilities, safety and mission assurance, etc.

(2) Flight and Ground Operations—pre-flight planning, crew training, oper-
ations,  mission  support  for  each  missions,  maintenance  and  operation  of
support  facilities,  final  integration  and  checkout  of  flight  hardware  for
launch, etc.

(3) Flight  Hardware—manufacturing  and  testing  of  the  Orbiter,  Space  Shut-
tle  Main  Engines,  External  Tank,  Solid  Rocket  Motors,  and  Solid  Rocket
Boosters, as well as any needed design and development activities.

The FY 2007 plans for the Space Shuttle program assumed that four Shuttle mis-
sions  would  be  conducted  during  the  current  fiscal  year.  At  present,  NASA  antici-
pates  that  it  will  be  able  to  complete  three.  NASA’s  FY  2008  budget  request  as-
sumes  five  Shuttle  flights  during  FY  2008—four  to  the  ISS  and  one  to  service  the
Hubble  Space  Telescope.  Overall,  NASA  is  projecting  12  Shuttle  flights  to  the  ISS,
one  to  Hubble,  and  two  ISS  ‘‘contingency’’  logistics  flights  prior  to  the  Shuttle’s  re-
tirement.

As  part  of  the  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  NASA  has  been  directed
to  ‘‘focus  use  of  the  Space  Shuttle  to  complete  assembly  of  the  International  Space
Station; and retire the Space Shuttle as soon as assembly of the International Space
Station is completed, planned for the end of this decade.’’ As a result, NASA is also
taking steps to begin the transition of the Shuttle workforce and facilities, including
identification of assets that will not be needed for follow-on programs and thus can
be  decommissioned/disposed  of  by  the  agency.  NASA  has  submitted  some  proposed
legislative  provisions  to  Congress  intended  to  address  Shuttle  transition  issues.
Those legislative proposals will be the focus of a future Subcommittee hearing.

Approximately 500 members of the International Association of Machinists (IAM)
have  been  on  strike  at  the  NASA  Kennedy  Space  Center  since  June  14th  of  this
year as part of a contract dispute with the United Space Alliance (USA), which oper-
ates  the  Space  Shuttle  for  NASA.  The  IAM  strikers  have  asserted  that  USA  ‘‘has
abandoned  safety,  training,  and  paperwork  requirements  they  have  held  us  to  for
years’’  during  the  strike.  USA,  for  its  part,  has  stated  that  replacement  workers
were  ‘‘properly  trained  and,  where  required,  certified  as  proficient  to  safely  perform
the  task  supporting  Shuttle  processing.’’  Without  attempting  to  judge  the  competing
claims,  Members  may  wish  to  see  what  steps  NASA  independently  is  taking  to  en-
sure that Shuttle processing activities are being conducted safely.

The following are a number of the challenges related to the FY08 budget request

and five-year runout for the Space Shuttle program:

• Impact  of  reduced  Space  Shuttle  reserves  to  address  remaining  program

threats prior to retirement of the Shuttle

• Feasibility of safely completing the currently planned Shuttle launch schedule
prior  to  the  scheduled  retirement  date  in  light  of  the  technical  issues  that
have  arisen  during  preparations  for  several  of  the  missions  since  the  Shuttle
returned-to-flight

• Need  to  maintain  necessary  Shuttle  workforce  and  skills  through  remaining

flight schedule

• Potential  Space  Shuttle  program  transition  and  retirement  requirements—
budget  submitted  to  Congress  does  not  include  funds  to  address  these  issues
past  FY  2010,  with  explanation  given  that  the  requirement  are  not  yet  well
defined.

Space Shuttle Servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope

5

In  late  October  2006,  NASA  Administrator  Michael  Griffin  announced  plans  to
conduct  a  final  Shuttle  servicing  mission  to  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  The  serv-
icing mission (SM4) will be the fifth Hubble servicing mission since the Hubble was
deployed in 1990 and will improve and enable the telescope’s continuing operations
through 2013. The flight is currently manifested on Shuttle mission STS–125, which
is targeted to fly on Atlantis in September 2008. It will be the only non-ISS-related
Shuttle mission among the remaining Shuttle flights.

The  servicing  mission  will  involve  a  series  of  five  challenging  spacewalks  to  re-
place  and  upgrade  components  such  as  batteries  and  gyroscopes  and  to  install  new
science instruments—the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) and Wide Field Cam-
era 3 (WFC3). The COS will allow astronomers to look at the structure and composi-
tion of the universe and the WFC3 will look through the infrared, visible, and ultra-
violet wavelengths of light to provide insight into planets, the formation of the solar
system,  the  study  of  early  and  distant  galaxies,  and  the  formation  of  stars.  Astro-
nauts servicing the Hubble will also attempt to repair the Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph  (STIS)  instrument  installed  in  1997,  which  lost  power  in  2004.  That
instrument performs high resolution studies of nearby stars and distant galaxies in
visible and infrared wavelengths. Astronauts will also install a Soft Capture Mecha-
nism  to  allow  a  vehicle  to  attach  to  the  Hubble  and  safely  de-orbit  the  spacecraft
once it reaches the end of its mission.

The  SM4  mission  was  intended  to  fly  earlier  in  the  decade.  After  the  loss  of  the
Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003, NASA decided, in January 2004 not to conduct the
mission.  The  cancellation  of  the  servicing  mission  and  expected  loss  of  the  Hubble
around  2007–2008  prompted  an  outcry  from  the  public  and  science  community.
NASA  continued  to  evaluate  options  for  extending  the  Hubble’s  operating  lifetime,
including  a  possible  robotic  servicing  mission.  The  National  Academies’  Assessment
of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope report recommended
‘‘that NASA should commit to a servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope that
accomplishes the objectives of the originally planned SM–4 mission.’’
Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) Report

ASAP  recently  released  its  2006  Annual  Report.  In  that  report,  the  Panel  made
several  observations  and  recommendations  related  to  the  Space  Shuttle  program.
Quoting the report, some of those are as follows:

• ‘‘NASA  has  shown  an  appreciation  of  the  persistence  of  risk  associated  with
the  Shuttle,  and  therefore  the  continuing  need  to  properly  assess  it—so  that
appropriate measures can be taken to mitigate that risk through the remainder
of the program.’’
• ‘‘The ASAP has observed that launch decisions are too regularly being elevated
to the Administrator level, and the Panel noted the lack of an analytical risk-
assessment  process  that  is  standardized,  comprehensive  and  well  understood
throughout the agency.’’
• ‘‘The ASAP said it was concerned about NASA’s shift away from an approach
aimed at modifying safety culture to one that appeared to only monitor the sta-
tus  of  the  culture. . .  Despite  these  concerns,  the  ASAP  does  find  signs  of  im-
proving  safety  culture,  particularly  indications  that  communications  have  be-
come more open within the Agency.’’
• ‘‘For  the  Space  Shuttle,  as  with  other  programs,  it  is  management’s  responsi-
bility  to  set  priorities  and  assess  risk—and  eliminating  all  risk  is  an  unreal-
istic  goal.  The  Agency  and  the  Shuttle  Program  must  guard  against  devel-
oping ‘tunnel vision’ with respect to foam, which could distract them from po-
tential problems developing in other areas.’’

International Space Station Program
Fiscal  Year  2008  Budget  Request  for  International  Space  Station  Program

(ISS)

The  FY08  budget  request  for  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  program  is
$2.239 billion. [A multi-year funding chart for the Space Shuttle and ISS programs
is  included  as  an  attachment  to  this  memo.]  Funding  for  the  ISS  program  is  used
to pay for the following:

(1) Flight  Hardware—It  should  be  noted  that,  according  to  NASA,  all  U.S.
ISS  development  activities  will  be  completed  with  the  exception  of  Habit-
ability upgrades and improvements to the ExPRESS Logistics Carrier

(2) ISS Operations Program Integration Activities

6

(3) ISS Spacecraft Operations Activities
(4) ISS Launch and Mission Operations
(5) Multi-User System Support (MUSS)
(6) ISS  Crew-Cargo  Services—To  be  provided  by  commercial  entities  or
International  Partners  (e.g.,  Europeans,  Japanese,  Russians).  Over  the
near-term,  the  funding  is  primarily  to  pay  the  Russians  for  Soyuz  and
Progress services.

The  ISS  program  is  currently  in  the  most  challenging  portion  of  the  assembly
phase. In FY 2008, ‘‘Node 2’’ will be launched, which is a key piece of ISS hardware
that  will  allow  the  European  and  Japanese  pressurized  modules  to  be  added  to  the
ISS  in  2008.  In  addition,  the  truss  [‘‘backbone’’]  of  the  ISS  will  be  completed  and
additional  solar  power  added.  The  European  ATV  cargo  carrier  is  also  scheduled  to
be  launched  to  the  ISS  in  late  2007  or  early  2008.  That  will  provide  an  additional
means  of  getting  cargo  to  the  ISS  besides  the  Space  Shuttle  and  the  Russian
Progress cargo vehicle.

In  addition,  under  the  Commercial  Orbital  Transportation  System  [COTS]  pro-
gram, potential commercial cargo services providers will be continuing their develop-
ment  activities  in  FY08.  NASA  is  proposing  to  carry  out  a  competition  to  award  a
contract  to  one  or  more  commercial  providers  for  cargo  delivery  [and  perhaps  even-
tually  crew  transfer  services]  to  the  ISS.  The  Subcommittee  plans  to  examine  the
status  and  issues  related  to  COTS  and  logistical  support  of  the  ISS  in  a  future
meeting.

In  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  [P.L.  109–155],  Congress  directed  the  es-
tablishment  of  an  ISS  Independent  Safety  Task  Force  to  ‘‘review  the  International
Space  Station  program  with  the  objective  of  discovering  and  assessing  any
vulnerabilities  of  the  International  Space  Station  that  could  lead  to  its  destruction,
compromise  the  health  of  its  crew,  or  necessitate  its  premature  abandonment.’’  The
Task Force delivered its report to Congress earlier this year, and its principal obser-
vations and recommendations are listed in the following section of this hearing char-
ter.  The  Chair  of  the  Task  Force  will  be  testifying  before  the  Subcommittee  at  this
hearing.

The following are a number of challenges related to the FY08 budget request and

five-year runout for the ISS program:

• The  ISS  program  has  depleted  reserves  through  FY  2008  while  facing  the

most challenging period of ISS assembly.

• According  to  NASA,  there  is  a  $300  million  shortfall  in  the  ISS  Crew-Cargo
Services  budget  based  on  current  estimates,  with  an  additional  $600  million
shortfall being held as a lien against the Exploration Systems Mission Direc-
torate  budget.  The  ISS  Independent  Safety  Task  Force  was  very  concerned
about the adequacy of the ISS’s post-Shuttle logistics support.

of the Shuttle retirement.

• There  are  additional  threats  to  reserves  related  to  dealing  with  the  impact
• Although two of the remaining Shuttle flights are listed as ‘‘contingency’’ and
have  not  yet  been  approved  by  OMB—although  NASA  says  sufficient  funds
have  been  included  in  the  budget—NASA  indicates  that  those  flights  will  be
needed  to  deliver  spares  and  logistics  in  advance  of  the  Shuttle’s  retirement,
i.e., they should not be considered optional flights.
• Current  International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations  (ITAR)  restrictions  on
NASA  ‘‘are  a  threat  to  the  safe  and  successful  integration  and  operations  of
the  International  Space  Station,’’  according  to  the  ISS  Independent  Safety
Task Force.
• Funding for ISS research has been cut back significantly over the last several
years,  and  the  research  community  that  was  intended  to  utilize  the  ISS  has
been  decimated  by  the  reductions  in  funding.  No  well  defined  research  and
utilization  plan  yet  exists,  which  raises  concerns  about  the  ability  of  NASA
to make productive use of the ISS once it is assembled.

ward  crew  health  issues.  The  International  Space  Station  Program’s  oper-
ating procedures and processes are thorough and sound.
• The International Space Station currently has an experienced, knowledgeable,
and  proactive  team,  both  internally  and  in  its  institutional  technical  checks
and balances, that provides the defense for process and management failures
that  might  lead  to  an  ISS  safety  or  major  crew  health  issue.  This  posture
must be maintained to continue the Station’s successful operation.

options to decrease the risk of micrometeoroid and orbital debris.

• The International Space Station Program should place the highest priority on
• NASA should develop and implement plans to maintain Station critical skills
• The  Administration,  Congress,  and  NASA  should  support  the  completion  of
the  current  Shuttle  manifest  to  the  International  Space  Station,  including
flights  ULF–4  and  ULF–5,  to  assemble  a  viable  Station  and  provide  spares
for its long-term operation.
• The  Administration,  Congress,  and  NASA  should  support  a  proactive  and
phased  post-Shuttle  logistical  transportation  program,  including  adequate
funding of approximately one billion dollars per year above current allocations
to  ensure  that  adequate  logistics  and  spares  are  available  to  maintain  a  via-

• NASA  senior  management  should  conduct  a  comprehensive  review  of  the
Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  to  ensure  agreement  of  the  policies,  approach,
and technical implementation of the safety strategy for the Automated Trans-
fer Vehicle’s demonstration flight. [Note: This review was conducted on Janu-
ary 8, 2007, and met the intent of this recommendation.]
• The  Department  of  State  should  grant  immediate  relief  from  the  Inter-
national  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulation  restrictions  in  the  form  of  an  exemption
to  allow  NASA  contractors  direct  interaction  with  the  International  Space
Station’s  International  Partners  and  their  contractors.  This  must  be  affected
no  later  than  summer  2007  to  support  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  oper-
ations.
• The  ISS  Program  should  carefully  consider  implementing  all  IISTF  rec-
ommendations  to  improve  the  overall  safeguards  and  controls  against
vulnerabilities.

Utilization of the International Space Station
Current Status

8

NASA’s priorities include completing the assembly of the International Space Sta-
tion  (ISS)  by  2010  and  then  retiring  the  Shuttle.  Based  on  current  plans,  starting
in 2010 NASA intends to utilize the ISS to conduct research that supports mission-
enabling  objectives  for  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  A  2006  report  by  the  Na-
tional  Academies  that  reviewed  NASA’s  ISS  plans  states  that  ‘‘these  objectives  rep-
resent  a  major  shift  in  research  goals  compared  to  earlier  versions  of  ISS  plans.  It
has always been an ISS objective to study and develop countermeasures for the detri-
mental effects of space flight on astronauts. However, ISS plans had also previously
included  a  major  focus  on  basic  research  in  a  number  of  diverse  fields  of  biological
and physical sciences, with research projects directed at increasing fundamental sci-
entific  understanding  as  well  as  eventual  terrestrial  applications  such  as  under-
standing  disease  or  improving  industrial  technologies.’’  As  part  of  that  shift,  NASA
severely  cut  the  support  of  scientists  working  on  basic  research  and  longer-term
challenges in space biology and medicine and the physical sciences. According to the
January–March  2007  Newsletter  of  the  National  Academies’  Space  Studies  Board,
the human research program lost 59 percent of its investigators, fundamental space
biology  lost  88  percent  of  its  researchers,  and  the  physical  sciences  lost  84  percent
of its research community. Correspondingly large cuts were made to NASA’s life and
physical  sciences  microgravity  research  and  applications  budgets  over  the  past  sev-
eral years.

Only  a  few  years  remain  before  NASA  is  scheduled  to  complete  assembly  of  the
ISS and focus on utilizing the Station. At present, however, NASA still lacks a well
defined utilization plan with schedules, milestones, specific and prioritized research
experiments  to  actually  realize  the  broad  research  goals  outlined  by  NASA,  budg-
etary  profiles  and  resource  commitments  (logistics,  crew  time,  funding)  needed  to
execute the plan.

In  the  face  of  these  realities,  issues  that  Members  may  wish  to  examine  are
whether  a  world-class  research  community  that  can  support  investigations  to
achieve  NASA’s  utilization  objectives  will  be  available  in  2010  under  NASA’s  cur-
rent  approach,  and  whether  experiments  that  contribute  to  NASA’s  mission-ena-
bling objectives will be mature and ready for flight. Another issue is what the impli-
cations  of  the  reductions  to  fundamental  life  and  physical  science  research  will  be
for  NASA’s  ability  to  achieve  its  longer-term  exploration  goals  as  well  as  its  ability
to  deliver  the  terrestrial  benefits  of  ISS  research  that  the  Agency  had  long  used  to
help justify the ISS program. According to a National Academies report, An Assess-
ment  of  Balance  in  NASA’s  Science  Programs,  published  in  2006,  ‘‘Analysis  of  the
NASA FY 2007 budget suggests that funds will not be provided for the physical and
biological  research  necessary  to  identify  and  define  problems  that  are  critical  to
human survival and function in long-term space flight or to develop new technologies
and countermeasures to overcome these challenges.’’
The ISS as a National Laboratory

The  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005,  apart  from  establishing  requirements  for
NASA-supported  exploration  and  non-exploration  ISS  research,  designates  the  ISS
as  a  national  laboratory.  The  Act  seeks  to  increase  the  utilization  of  the  ISS  by
other federal agencies and the private sector. NASA prepared a report for Congress,
International  Space  Station  National  Laboratory  Application  Development,  dated
April  2007,  as  required  under  the  Act.  According  to  the  report,  NASA’s  primary
strategy for the ISS national laboratory is ‘‘early efforts on identifying qualified end-
users  from  the  public  and  private  sectors.’’  To  that  end,  NASA  has  taken  the  fol-
lowing steps:

technology, engineering, and math (STEM) activities;

• led  an  interagency  task  force  to  explore  how  ISS  might  be  used  for  science,
• entered  into  discussions  on  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  with  the  Na-
• issued  a  Sources  Sought  announcement  seeking  commercially-provided  water

tional Institutes of Health on use of the ISS;

generation services on the ISS.

The  report  indicates  that  NASA  will  support  the  operations  and  maintenance  of
the  ISS.  Public  and  private  sector  partners  seeking  to  use  the  ISS  will  most  likely
be  required  to  pay  for  transporting  any  experiments,  equipment,  and  supplies  sup-
porting  their  utilization  to  the  ISS.  According  to  the  report,  NASA  identifies  the
‘‘availability of cost-effective transportation services’’ as the most significant risk fac-
tor  in  the  success  of  the  national  laboratory.  NASA  plans  to  begin  managing  the
operations  and  utilization  of  the  ISS  national  laboratory  internally.  If  non-govern-

mental  interests  in  using  the  ISS  grow,  NASA  may  develop  an  institute  to  manage
non-governmental utilization.

In exploring the opportunities for using the ISS National Laboratory for potential
educational  activities,  a  NASA-led  task  force  produced  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion  National  Laboratory  Education  Concept  Development  Report.  The  task  force
concluded  ‘‘that  there  is  significant  interest  among  other  federal  agencies  in  the  op-
portunity to further develop the ISS as an asset for education.’’ The report discusses
potential  educational  projects  that  non-NASA  users  could  conduct  on  the  ISS  na-
tional laboratory and also discusses the opportunities for American students to par-
ticipate in international projects and benefit from the international cooperative envi-
ronment that the ISS offers.

According  to  NASA’s  ISS  National  Laboratory  report,  the  success  of  the  ISS  Na-
tional  Laboratory  concept  will,  in  part,  determine  how  long  NASA  plans  to  operate
the  ISS.  As  described  in  the  report,  the  ISS  has  a  15-year  design  lifetime,  based
on  the  launch  of  the  first  element  in  February  2001,  and  NASA’s  budget  for  ISS
operations  reflects  the  15-year  period.  NASA  has  therefore  estimated  FY  2016  as
the  end  of  the  operations  of  the  ISS.  The  report  notes  that  NASA  will  allow  four
years,  FY  2011–FY  2014,  to  assess  the  ‘‘value’’  of  the  ISS  as  a  national  laboratory,
at which point NASA would need to extend the ‘‘certified design lifetime.’’ That proc-
ess  could  involve  tests  and  analyses  that  would  require  lead  time  and  decisions  on
costs versus benefits.

Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS)

The  Alpha  Magnetic  Spectrometer  (AMS)  is  a  particle  physics  experiment  pro-
posed  by  Dr.  Samuel  Ting  of  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  to  search
for  antimatter  in  the  universe.  AMS,  which  is  sponsored  by  the  Department  of  En-
ergy  (DOE),  is  designed  to  be  flown  on  the  Space  Shuttle  and  attached  to  the  exte-
rior of the ISS. Some 16 international partners are involved in the project and have
funded  and  performed  the  majority  of  its  construction.  In  1995,  NASA  entered  into
an  agreement  with  the  DOE  to  provide  AMS  with  three  years  of  operation  on  the
ISS. Space Shuttle Discovery flew a prototype of the experiment in 1998.

Following  the  Space  Shuttle  Columbia  accident,  NASA  focused  on  the  return-to-
flight  of  the  Shuttle  and  completion  of  the  ISS  consistent  with  the  Vision  to  Space
Exploration. In a 2005 letter from NASA to DOE, NASA stated that it ‘‘cannot com-
mit  to  a  Shuttle  flight  for  AMS  to  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  given  cur-
rent constraints.’’ In a 2006 letter from the NASA Administrator to Senator Kay Bai-
ley Hutchinson, NASA maintained its position that it could not commit to a Shuttle
flight  for  AMS  and  noted  that  ‘‘NASA  intends  to  proceed  with  the  payload  integra-
tion  process  within  the  existing  AMS  budget  in  order  to  preserve  the  option  of  a  fu-
ture  launch.’’  NASA  personnel  have  indicated  that  they  believe  that  alternatives  to
a  Shuttle  launch,  including  launch  on  a  foreign  launch  vehicle,  would  require  sig-
nificant  and  costly  modifications  to  the  payload  and  launch  vehicle.  Thus,  at  this
point, NASA has no plans to fly the AMS to the ISS.

Chairman UDALL. This hearing will come to order. Good morning
to  all  of  you  who  have  assembled  here.  I  want  to  begin  by  wel-
coming  all  of  our  witnesses  to  today’s  hearing.  This  morning  we
will  be  examining  NASA’s  Space  Shuttle  and  International  Space
Station  programs.  I  think  it  is  appropriate  that  we  consider  both
of  these  programs  at  the  same  hearing  since  the  Shuttle  and  Sta-
tion activities are tightly coupled and issues affecting one program
can have a direct impact on the other.

As we all know, NASA successfully completed its Shuttle mission
to  the  ISS  last  month,  and  another  Shuttle  mission  to  the  ISS  is
scheduled  for  early  next  month.  And  by  all  accounts  last  month’s
STS–117  flight  was  a  very  challenging  ISS  mission  during  one  of
the hardest parts of the Station’s assembly phase.

It  is  a  testament  to  the  skill  of  the  entire  NASA  team  that  they
have  made  assembling  the  ISS  in  orbit  look  relatively  easy,  when
the reality is that it is anything but easy.

So  in  that  spirit  I  want  to  congratulate  you,  Mr.  Gerstenmaier,
on last month’s success and wish you well on next month’s mission.
NASA also is preparing for next year’s Shuttle mission to service
the Hubble Space Telescope. Many of us were very concerned when
that servicing mission was canceled by the previous NASA Admin-
istrator,  and  I  am  pleased  that  it  is  back  on  the  Shuttle  manifest.
We  all  look  forward  to  hearing  about  its  status  at  today’s  hearing
as well.

However,  assembling  the  ISS  and  servicing  Hubble  are  only  two
of the challenges that NASA will need to address over the next sev-
eral  years  in  its  human  space  flight  programs.  The  Space  Shuttle
is scheduled to be retired upon the completion of the ISS at the end
of  this  decade,  and  there  are  a  great  many  issues  that  will  need
to  be  addressed  during  this  transition  period,  and  dealing  with
workforce concerns is clearly an important one.

This  subcommittee  held  an  initial  hearing  on  NASA’s  workforce
in May, and I anticipate that we will examine NASA’s plans for the
Shuttle workforce, including its legislative proposals, in greater de-
tail at another hearing later this year.

Another  area  of  great  concern  is  how  the  ISS  will  be  supported
logistically  once  the  Shuttle  is  retired.  It  is  not  yet  clear  that
NASA’s  budget  for  logistical  support  of  the  Station  is  sufficient  for
the  task  or  that  all  of  the  planned  capabilities  will  be  available
when  needed.  I  hope  that  today’s  hearing  will  shed  some  light  on
the situation.

Yet  all  of  the  work  being  done  to  assemble  the  Station  and  sup-
port  it  logistically  is  not  meant  to  be  an  end  in  itself.  Rather,  it  is
the  degree  to  which  it  is  utilized  productively  that  will  determine
the ultimate success or failure of the ISS.

That  is  why  a  number  of  us  have  been  so  concerned  about  the
severe  cutbacks  in  NASA’s  Space  Station  research  program  and
budget  over  the  past  several  years.  Those  cuts  have  largely  deci-
mated  the  research  community  that  had  planned  to  use  the  Sta-
tion,  with  potentially  serious  implications  for  the  productivity  of
the Station as a research facility once it is assembled.

In addition, NASA has yet to develop a well-defined research pro-
gram  for  the  Station  that  contains  clear  milestones,  prioritized  re-
search  objectives  and  experiments,  and  resource  requirements.  We

all  understand  that  funding  is  tight  and  that  funding  for  the  Sta-
tion research has to compete with other NASA priorities.

However,  the  Nation  has  invested  substantial  funds  over  many
years  to  develop  and  build  the  Station.  And  the  NASA  team  rep-
resented  by  Mr.  Gerstenmaier  worked  hard  to  make  the  Station  a
reality. It seems to me that we need to insure that the Nation gets
an adequate return on that investment.

We  have  a  great  many  issues  to  cover  at  today’s  hearing,  and
again, I want to welcome our witnesses, and I look forward to your
testimony.

The  Chair  now  with  great  pleasure  recognizes  Mr.  Feeney,  the

Ranking Member, for his opening statement.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Udall follows:]

It’s not yet clear that NASA’s budget for logistical support of the Station is suffi-
cient for the task, or that all of the planned capabilities will be available when need-
ed. I hope that today’s hearing will shed some light on the situation.

portant one.

the  ISS  a  reality.  It  seems  to  me  that  we  need  to  ensure  that  the  nation  gets  an
adequate return on that investment.

Well,  we  have  a  great  many  issues  to  cover  at  today’s  hearing.  I  again  want  to

welcome our witnesses, and I look forward to your testimony.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  thank  you,  Chairman,  for  holding  today’s  im-
portant hearing on the Space Shuttle and International Space Sta-
tion,  where  we  will  examine  the  interrelationships  between  these
programs and gain insight about supporting and operating the ISS
in the post-Shuttle era.

As  you  know,  Mr.  Chairman,  many  of  my  constituents  at  Ken-
nedy  Space  Center  prepare  Space  Station  components  and  the
Space Shuttle for launch. I appreciate the fact that you are consid-
ering holding a hearing later this year to examine NASA’s Shuttle
to Constellation transition planning, which is very important in my
district  as  well  as  many  other  areas  that  are  interested  in  space.
I look forward to working with you on this hearing. We can’t re-
peat  past  mistakes  like  the  Apollo  to  Shuttle  transition  where
America  frittered  away  hard-earned,  space-faring  skills  which  are
almost impossible to replace.

NASA  faces  many  challenges,  both  now  and  in  the  future,  chief
among  them  is  to  safely  maintain  the  International  Space  Station,
support  its  research  agenda,  and  insure  the  safety  of  the  crews
while  transitioning  to  the  new  Orion  spacecraft  and  the  Ares
launch  vehicles.  To  do  this  NASA  intends  to  increase  reliance  on
our international partners and the new Commercial Orbital Trans-
portation  System  capacity,  COTS.  We  need  to  better  understand
the implications of this strategy, and in fact, I note that Mr. Hollo-
way in his testimony expresses some concerns about heavily relying
on  COTS  until  it  is  a  proven  technology.  I  hope  to  explore  that
today.

In  the  post-Shuttle  era  COTS  will  hopefully  provide  a  viable  re-
placement  of  the  Shuttle’s  capability  to  deliver  cargo  and  crew  to
the  International  Space  Station.  Establishing  private  commercial
providers to perform these tasks will bring a new and much desired
dimension to space faring.

NASA  may  also  increase  its  reliance  on  international  partners.
The Russians will continue to play a significant role but NASA also
plans  to  use  the  European  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  that  will
have  roughly  three  times  the  cargo  capability  of  Russian  progress.
Development of the ATV has been delayed, but the first one is cur-
rently  being  shipped  to  its  French  Guiana  launch  site  with  launch
scheduled  for  January  of  next  year.  If  we  become  more  reliant  on
the international community, I want to understand the effect of the
International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulation  restrictions  on  NASA’s
ability  to  work  with  our  international  partners,  and,  again,  Mr.
Holloway’s report addresses some concerns in that area.

As  NASA  works  to  complete  the  International  Space  Station  it
should fully examine the capabilities for exploration-related as well
as  non-exploration  related  International  Space  Station  research.
The  success  of  the  International  Space  Station  as  a  National  Lab-
oratory depends in part on maintaining sufficient research capabili-
ties, which the Chairman mentioned in his opening remarks, need-
ed  to  prepare  humans  for  long-duration  lunar  missions  among
other things.

I  remain  vigilant  about  the  temptation  to  backslide  into  pre-Co-
lumbia  behavior,  burdening  NASA  to  do  too  much  with  too  little.
Demands on NASA must be tempered. Furthermore, this Adminis-
tration  and  Congress  must  deliver  the  resources  needed  to  com-
plete what has been assigned. That means adequate budgets in fis-
cal year 2008, and beyond.

I am concerned about this year’s appropriations. The $18 million
reduction  from  NASA’s  request  for  International  Space  Station  re-
serves  and  the  $85  million  reduction  in  needed  replacements  for
the tracking and data relay satellite system represent a fiddling at
the  margins  that  cumulatively  invites  more  serious  consequences
down the road.

When the world thinks of NASA, it envisions human space explo-
ration.  We  are  once  again  laying  the  foundation  to  explore  beyond
low-Earth  orbit.  Human  space  flight  is  one  of  the  most  inspira-
tional  undertakings  we  do  as  a  nation.  Indeed,  other  nations  now
strive  to  emulate  our  successes  because  they  recognize  the  great
national prestige that accompanies human space exploration.

By  the  way,  I  have  been  heartened  in  reading  the  testimony  of
the  witnesses  about  where  we  are  in  the  space  program  today.
Looking  back,  I  was  a  newly  elected  Congressman  a  couple  of
weeks into my tenure when we had the last disaster, and it is with
a great deal of optimism that I read the remarks and the testimony
about where we are today given where we could be.

Finally, NASA often makes the difficult look easy, but significant
challenges await. I welcome today’s distinguished panel, and thank
you  for  taking  the  time  to  help  us  better  understand  and  prepare
for  those  challenges.  In  particular,  I  want  to  thank  Mr.  Bill
Gerstenmaier and thank you for your long-term, dedicated service.
With  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  again,  I  appreciate  the  work  that  you

and the staff has done to prepare us for this hearing.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE TOM FEENEY

Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman  for  holding  today’s  important  hearing  on  the  Space
Shuttle  and  International  Space  Station  (ISS).  We  will  examine  the  interrelation-
ships between these programs and gain insight about supporting and operating ISS
in the post-Shuttle era.

As you know Mr. Chairman, many of my constituents at the Kennedy Space Cen-
ter  prepare  Space  Station  components  and  the  Space  Shuttle  for  launch.  I  under-
stand  you  are  considering  a  hearing  later  this  year  to  examine  NASA’s  Shuttle  to
Constellation  transition  planning.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  on  this  hear-
ing.  We  can’t  repeat  past  mistakes—like  the  Apollo  to  Shuttle  transition—where
America frittered away hard-earned spacefaring skills.

NASA  faces  many  challenges,  both  now  and  in  the  future.  Chief  among  them  is
to safely maintain the International Space Station, support its research agenda, and
ensure the safety of the crews, while transitioning to the new Orion spacecraft and
Ares  launch  vehicles.  To  do  this,  NASA  intends  to  increase  reliance  on  our  inter-
national  partners  and  the  new  Commercial  Orbital  Transportation  System  capa-
bility (COTS). We need to better understand the implications of this strategy.

In  the  post-Shuttle  era,  COTS  will  hopefully  provide  a  viable  replacement  of  the
Shuttle’s capability to delivery cargo and crew to ISS. Establishing private commer-
cial  providers  to  perform  these  tasks  would  bring  a  new  and  much  desired  dimen-
sion to spacefaring.

NASA may also increase its reliance on international partners. The Russians will
continue to play a significant role. But NASA also plans to use the European Auto-
mated  Transfer  Vehicle  (ATV)  that  will  have  roughly  three  times  the  cargo  capa-
bility  of  the  Russian  Progress.  Development  of  the  ATV  has  been  delayed.  But  the
first  one  is  currently  being  shipped  to  its  French  Guiana  launch  site  with  launch

scheduled for January 2008. If we become more reliant on the international commu-
nity, I want to understand the effect of the ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Reg-
ulation) restrictions on NASA’s ability to work with our international partners.

As  NASA  works  to  complete  the  ISS,  it  should  fully  examine  the  capabilities  for
exploration-related,  as  well  as  non-exploration-related  ISS  research.  The  success  of
ISS as a National Laboratory depends in part on maintaining sufficient research ca-
pabilities needed to prepare humans for long duration lunar missions.

I remain vigilant about the temptation to backslide into pre-Columbia behavior—
burdening  NASA  to  do  too  much  with  too  little.  Demands  on  NASA  must  be  tem-
pered.  Furthermore,  this  Administration  and  Congress  must  deliver  the  resources
needed to complete what has been assigned. That means adequate budgets in FY08
and  beyond.  I’m  concerned  about  this  year’s  appropriations.  The  $18  million  reduc-
tion  from  NASA’s  request  for  ISS  reserves  and  the  $85  million  reduction  in  needed
replacements for the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System represent a fiddling
at the margins that cumulatively invites more serious consequences.

When  the  world  thinks  of  NASA,  it  envisions  human  space  exploration.  We  are
once  again  laying  the  foundation  to  explore  beyond  low-Earth  orbit.  Human  space
flight is one of the most inspirational undertakings we do as a nation. Indeed, other
nations  now  strive  to  emulate  our  successes  because  they  recognize  the  great  na-
tional prestige that accompanies human space exploration.

NASA often makes the difficult look easy, but significant challenges await. I wel-
come  today’s  distinguished  panel  and  thank  you  for  taking  the  time  to  help  us  bet-
ter  understand  and  prepare  for  those  challenges.  In  particular,  I  want  to  welcome
Bill Gerstenmaier and thank you for your dedicated service.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Feeney.  At  this  point  I  would
like to make it clear that if there are Members who wish to submit
additional  opening  statements,  those  statements  will  be  added  to
the record. Without objection, so ordered.

At  this  time  I  would  like  to  introduce  our  panel  of  witnesses
today,  and  I  will  introduce  all  four  witnesses,  and  then  we  will
move back to my left, and we will start with Mr. Gerstenmaier. Mr.
Bill  Gerstenmaier  is  here  as  we  have  mentioned,  both  Mr.  Feeney
and myself, who is the associate administrator for the Space Oper-
ations Mission Directorate at NASA.

And  next  to  him  with  have  Mr.  Tommy  Holloway,  who  was  the
Chairman  for  the  ISS  Independent  Safety  Task  Force  Report,
which was completed in February of 2007.

Next  to  Mr.  Holloway,  Dr.  Paul  Neitzel,  who  is  a  Professor  of

Fluid Mechanics at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

And  finally  we  have  Ms.  Cristina  Chaplain,  who  is  a  Director  of
Acquisition and Sourcing Management at the Government Account-
ability Office.

Welcome to all of you. I think all of you know that spoken testi-
mony  is  limited  to  five  minutes,  after  each  and  after  which  the
members  of  the  Subcommittee  will  have  five  minutes  each  to  ask
questions.

We will start with Mr. Gerstenmaier.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  WILLIAM  H.  GERSTENMAIER,  ASSOCIATE
ADMINISTRATOR,  SPACE  OPERATIONS  MISSION  DIREC-
TORATE,  NATIONAL  AERONAUTICS  AND  SPACE  ADMINIS-
TRATION
Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Chairman  Udall,  Ranking  Member  Feeney,
thank you for inviting me here today. It is my privilege and pleas-
ure to represent the International Space Station and Space Shuttle
teams.  I  have  attempted  to  answer  your  questions  in  my  written
statement,  and  I  will  use  my  opening  remarks  to  expand  slightly

on  my  written  statement  and  provide  kind  of  the  latest  status  of
where we are with both Shuttle and Station.

This  is  a  very  dynamic  time  in  both  programs.  It  has  also  been
a  very  exciting  time  because  the  work  we  are  doing  now  directly
supports  the  future  of  human  space  exploration.  Lessons  we  have
been  learning  and  will  continue  to  learn  as  we  live  and  work
aboard the Space Station will help when we undertake our new ex-
ploration to the Moon, take our first steps on Mars, and the United
States  leads  to  the  expansion  of  humanity’s  reach  into  the  solar
system  beyond  the  current  confines  of  low-Earth  orbit.  The  work
we  are  doing  today  clearly  helps  and  supports  those  activities  in
the future.

Take,  for  example,  yesterday  the  Space  Station  crew  performed
a seven-hour and 41 minute space walk to complete several critical
tests for the continued assembly of the Space Station. Mostly likely
you have heard about how the crew disposed of the early ammonia
servicer  device  carrying  300  pounds  of  ammonia.  It  had  to  be  re-
moved  to  allow  for  the  P–6,  the  truss  that  sits  up  on  top,  to  be
moved to a new location on STS–120 scheduled for launch in Octo-
ber.

But  the  thing  that  is  important  is  they  did  many  other  tests  as
well.  They  changed  data  remote  power  control  module,  an  elec-
tronic  circuit  breaker.  This  device  provides  power,  a  redundant
power  to  the  mobile  transporter.  That  is  the  crane  that  runs  up
and  down  the  truss  of  the  Space  Station.  That  crane  needs  to  be
in  a  position  to  install  the  trusses  that  is  delivered  on  this  next
Shuttle  flight.  So  that  circuit  breaker  had  to  be  changed  out  to
allow the Shuttle flight to occur and be launched.

They  also  cleaned  some  debris  off  of  a  seal.  The  teams  went
ahead and actually took the arm earlier and looked at a seal on the
outside of the Space Station. This is a pressure seal that is, allowed
the modules to, when they back together, to be sealed and keep the
vacuum away from the side. We noticed some debris that had accu-
mulated  on  that  seal.  It  was  carried  up  in  the  Shuttle  on  one  of
the seals and got stuck there. The crew went out and cleaned that
debris off so then we can move another mating adaptor there. And
that activity is critical to an event that will occur later this month.
And  the  last  thing  that  they  did  was,  I  think  the  thing  that  is
important  to  see  how  all  these  are  connected  to  the  future  events
and  future  flights.  They  are  not  just  related  to  the  next  flight,  but
they  are  related  to  a  flight  that  may  be  occurring  in  the  fall  or
maybe  occurring  in  activity  later  this  month.  And  that  is  the  com-
plexity  of  the  Space  Station.  All  the  tasks  are  interrelated.  There
is  not  a  single  dimension.  There  are  multiple  interactions  between
all the different pieces.

While  the  Space  Station  team  was  doing  the  space  walk,  the
Shuttle  team  was  busy  getting  the  Shuttle  ready  for  launch  down
in Florida. The teams have done a good job getting that vehicle for
launch  on  August  7.  Tomorrow  we  will  do,  begin  a  two-day  readi-
ness  review  to  make  sure  that  everything  is  ready  for  that  flight,
but  everything  appears  on  track.  The  weather  has  been  a  little
tough in Florida in the afternoons, so there has been a lot of thun-
derstorms,  and  the  teams  have  been  able  to  work  around  those
thunderstorms as this process moves forward and things look pret-

18

ty  good,  and  we  will  have  an  extensive  two-day  review,  and  we
should be ready for launch on August 7.

Again, I think the teams have established a strong rhythm mov-
ing  forward  with  assembly.  We  recovered  from  the  hail  damage
that  occurred  to  the  tank  earlier  this  year.  That  was  an  amazing
team  effort  across  the  teams  to  get  that  tank  repaired.  That  tank
performed exactly as it was designed, did exactly what it was sup-
posed  to  do.  We  repaired  about  6,000  damages  sites  on  that  tank,
and the team did a phenomenal job with that.

So,  again,  I  think  things  are  moving  forward,  and  we  are  posed
for  the  future.  The  work  we  are  doing  today  postures  us  well  for
the  activities  in  the  future.  And  I  look  forward  to  your  questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gerstenmaier follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIAM H. GERSTENMAIER

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to appear before you today to discuss the status of the Space Shuttle and the Inter-
national Space Station (ISS). It is a pleasure to report to you the good year we have
had in the human space flight program, and the progress we are making in support
of  the  Nation’s  exploration  goals.  I  would  like  to  give  you  an  update  on  the  Space
Shuttle  and  ISS  programs,  discuss  the  challenges  over  the  next  five  years,  and
share with you some of our success stories.

Only  a  few  weeks  ago,  the  Shuttle  made  an  unscheduled  stop  at  the  Rick  Hus-
band Amarillo International Airport in Texas. Resting atop its modified Boeing 747
carrier, the Shuttle Atlantis was returning to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC)
in  Florida  following  a  successful  mission  to  the  ISS.  While  the  Shuttle  waited  in
sunny Amarillo for better weather on its planned flight to KSC, television news cov-
erage  showed  hundreds  of  people  gathering  around  the  airport  perimeter  to  catch
a  glimpse  of  the  Shuttle.  A  spontaneous  American  pilgrimage  ensued.  Some  drove
hours  and  took  time  off  work.  Parents  brought  their  children  and  paid  homage  to
their  space  program.  The  children  and  the  grownups  were  in  awe  at  the  sight  of
Atlantis.

Amarillo  should  remind  all  of  us  that  the  American  public,  in  the  face  of  chal-
lenges,  even  tragedy,  values  exploration  and  the  contributions  of  the  Space  Shuttle
and  the  ISS.  NASA  captures  the  imagination  of  Americans  to  reach  farther,  create
opportunities, and live beyond the confines of our environment.
International Space Station (ISS)

With  each  new  assembly  and  logistics  flight,  with  each  additional  year  of  contin-
uous habitation, the ISS continues to grow in both size and capability. In the second
half  of  2006,  NASA  successfully  completed  three  Space  Shuttle  missions,  including
ISS–12A  (STS–115)  and  ISS–12A.1  (STS–116),  which  continued  ISS  assembly  with
the  addition  of  the  P3,  P4,  and  P5  truss  segments.  In  June  2007,  ISS–13A  (STS–
117)  added  the  S3  and  S4  truss  segments,  further  boosting  available  power  on  the
ISS  to  42  kilowatts.  This  flight  allowed  for  the  final  step  in  activating  the  perma-
nent power and thermal systems on ISS. All of these new systems continue to oper-
ate  flawlessly.  As  of  the  ISS–13A  mission,  the  ISS  is  now  almost  250  tons,  which
represents  approximately  57  percent  of  the  mass  of  the  ISS  once  it  is  completed  in
2010. The pressurized volume has grown to 14,509 cubic feet, representing approxi-
mately  45  percent  of  the  final  configuration,  and  ten  of  the  twelve  truss  segments
and three of the four U.S. solar arrays are already on-orbit.

Our  state  of  preparedness  for  the  upcoming  missions  is  also  very  high,  with  the
ground-based  teams  exercised  and  fully  engaged  as  a  result  of  the  recently  com-
pleted  orbital  assembly  operations.  In  the  second  half  of  calendar  year  2007,  three
more  Space  Shuttle  missions  remain  on  schedule  to  deliver  the  S5  truss  segment,
Node  2,  and  the  first  partner  laboratory.  The  flight  readiness  review  for  the  first
of these missions, ISS–13A.1 (STS–118), will start tomorrow, July 25, 2007, in prep-
aration  for  a  launch  no  earlier  than  August  7.  Together,  ISS–13A.1  and  the  subse-
quent  mission,  ISS–10A  (STS–120),  will  complete  the  major  U.S.  pressurized  ele-
ments  of  the  Station,  after  which  we  will  turn  our  attention  to  fulfilling  commit-
ments to our international partners.

Europe,  Japan  and  Canada  are  preparing  for  an  exciting  period  in  human  space
flight as their elements launch over the next year. These will include the European
laboratory  Columbus,  the  Japanese  laboratory  Kibo  and  its  pressurized  logistics

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:35 Jan 24, 2008 Jkt 036737 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\072407\36737 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

module,  and  the  Canadian  dexterous  remote  manipulator  system  Dextre.  All  of
these  elements  have  been  delivered  to  KSC  and  are  going  through  their  final  pre-
flight  checkouts  and  launch  preparations.  In  addition,  the  European  Autonomous
Transfer Vehicle is scheduled for its maiden flight in early 2008.

The  ISS  is  also  proceeding  well  along  the  path  towards  seeing  the  crew  size  ex-
pand from three to six in 2009. The U.S.-built oxygen generation system (OGS) has
been  integrated  in  the  U.S.  laboratory  Destiny,  and  successfully  demonstrated  its
ability to produce oxygen on July 13. The water recovery system has completed de-
velopment and is awaiting launch in late 2008, thus completing the regenerative en-
vironmental control and life support system.

In addition to the Space Shuttle assembly missions, we must not forget about the
critical work being done on ISS every day. Since the last Space Shuttle mission, 1.8
million  lines  of  software  have  been  updated.  This  major  update  occurred  with  little
fanfare  but  was  critical  to  future  assembly.  In  addition,  NASA  preparations  for
STS–118  include  a  spacewalk  by  Expedition  15  astronauts  Fyodor  Yurchikhin  and
Clay  Anderson  to  replace  a  failed  remote  power  converter  and  clearing  the  P6  for
movement  on  STS–120  by  jettisoning  the  early  ammonia  servicer.  Building,  serv-
icing,  and  utilizing  the  ISS  is  a  twenty-four  hour  a  day,  seven  day  a  week  job  for
the ground controllers and crews—exactly the type of training that is needed to pre-
pare  our  teams  and  our  systems  for  long-duration  missions  to  the  lunar  surface,  to
Mars, and beyond.

The  Congressionally-mandated  ISS  Independent  Safety  Task  Force  (IISTF)  com-
pleted its work in February and found the program to be ‘‘robust and sound. . .with
respect  to  safety  and  crew  health.’’  The  Task  Force  made  seven  principal  rec-
ommendations  that  would  further  strengthen  the  ISS  program  by  increasing  the
likelihood  of  mission  success  and  mitigating  risks  to  crew  safety.  NASA  has  taken
action on those principal recommendations that are within our ability to effect, such
as  installation  of  Russian-built  debris  panels  on  their  service  module  to  reduce  the
risk  of  micrometeoroid  and  orbital  debris  impacts.  We  continue  to  monitor  the  per-
formance  of  the  debris  protection  system  through  regular  inspections  with  the  ISS
robotic arm, through Space Shuttle ‘‘fly arounds,’’ and during extra-vehicular activi-
ties  (EVAs)  performed  by  the  astronauts.  All  debris  impacts  seen  so  far  are  within
the  design  capability  of  the  ISS  and  are  being  recorded  to  improve  our  analytical
debris models.

With  respect  to  the  remaining  IISTF  recommendations,  NASA  has  implemented
a workforce strategy to ensure the Agency retains critical skills necessary to sustain
the  ISS.  The  Agency  also  remains  on  track  to  support  completion  of  the  current
Space Shuttle flight plan for ISS assembly. The Agency may fly up to two additional
ISS  logistics  flights  if  they  are  deemed  necessary  and  can  be  flown  before  the  end
of  2010.  The  IISTF  recommendation  to  comprehensively  review  the  European  ATV
logistics flight has been closed based on the review completed January 8, 2007.

We have also completed development and installed the first of two Space Station-
to-Shuttle power transfer systems (SSPTS) on the orbiter Endeavour for testing and
verification  on  ISS–13A.1.  SSPTS  allows  power  generated  by  the  ISS  solar  arrays
to  be  transferred  to,  and  used  by,  the  Space  Shuttle  while  docked  to  the  ISS.  This
capability  will  allow  the  orbiters  to  remain  docked  at  the  ISS  an  additional  three
to  four  days,  thereby  extending  our  ability  to  conduct  planned  and  unplanned  EVA
activities during the very complex assembly operations that lie ahead.

We  continue  to  employ  the  Station’s  unique  attributes  for  the  advancement  of
science  and  technology.  During  Expedition  14,  there  were  thirty-two  U.S.  experi-
ments  conducted,  and  in  Expedition  15  another  twenty-one  are  underway.  These
range  across  the  life  and  physical  sciences,  and  highlight  growing  interest  in  use
of the microgravity environment to advance knowledge in the fields of microbiology,
genetics, bacteriology, and the metabolic nature of chronic human diseases. The up-
coming ISS–13A.1 assembly mission will include research designed by Amgen, Inc.,
a  leading  Fortune  500  human  therapeutics  company  in  the  biotechnology  industry.
A primary focus for U.S. research on ISS is to find ways of mitigating risks associ-
ated  with  long-duration  human  exploration  of  the  Moon  and  Mars.  These  risks  in-
clude a broad range of physiological and psychological issues, including those associ-
ated  with  extended  operations  in  reduced  and  microgravity  environments  (such  as
accelerated bone loss, adaptation to changing gravity loads, muscle loss, changes to
cardiovascular functions, altered immune system responses, and drug effectiveness),
guaranteeing  proper  nutrition  and  medical  support  while  operating  far  from  Earth,
improving  ergonomics  and  human-machine  interfaces,  and  ensuring  effective  crew
performance  and  cohesiveness.  The  ISS  is  critically  important  to  the  success  of  fu-
ture long-duration missions specifically because it is the only facility that combines
the ambient environment and research capabilities needed to understand the extent
of these risks with the ability to develop and test appropriate countermeasures.

Research  underway  during  the  assembly  phase  is  a  prelude  to  future  operation
of  the  U.S.  portion  of  the  ISS  as  a  National  Laboratory  as  directed  by  Section  507
of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109–155). On May 30, 2007, NASA sub-
mitted  to  the  Subcommittee  a  report  required  by  Section  507(c)  which  outlined  the
Agency’s  plans  for  operating  the  ISS  as  a  National  Laboratory,  including  progress
in  implementing  a  broad  ISS  applications  development  initiative  and  the  prospects
for  productive  utilization  of  the  ISS  in  the  post-assembly  timeframe.  This  initiative
is just beginning in anticipation of completing ISS assembly in 2010, and holds the
promise for highly productive public and private partnerships in research and devel-
opment—provided that needed space transportation services are available in the fu-
ture.

With respect to the logistical requirements for ISS operations and utilization after
the  retirement  of  the  Shuttle,  on  March  1,  2006,  as  required  by  Section  505  (c)(2)
of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109–155), NASA submitted to the Sub-
committee a report outlining contingency plans for logistics and on-orbit capabilities
for  the  ISS.  These  plans  include  using  the  Space  Shuttle  to  preposition  key  spares,
working  with  industry  to  demonstrate  and  then  utilize  commercial  services  for
transporting crew and cargo to the ISS, using the Crew Exploration Vehicle to sup-
ply  the  ISS  if  commercial  services  are  unavailable,  and  working  with  International
Partners  to  develop  additional  capacities  in  the  event  they  become  necessary.  As  of
today, our plans remain the same as outlined in this report,
Space Shuttle

As  we  reflect  upon  the  four  successful  Space  Shuttle  missions  (STS–121,  –115,
–116,  and  –117)  conducted  in  the  last  11  months  and  get  back  into  the  rhythm  of
launching every couple of months, it is important to keep in mind that flying these
vehicles is neither easy nor routine.

The  Space  Shuttle  is  an  extraordinarily  capable  transportation  system,  and  it
takes an equally extraordinary team to operate that system safely, time after time,
mission after mission. When you are working on a construction site that is 200 nau-
tical  miles  above  the  Earth’s  surface  and  that  is  dominated  by  hard  vacuum  and
extreme  temperature  fluctuations,  preparedness  is  essential  for  mission  success.  At
Kennedy  Space  Center  alone,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  work-hours  are  needed  to
prepare  the  hardware  for  flight.  For  every  hour  a  crew  member  spends  outside  on
an EVA during a mission, seven hours are spent in the training pool at the Neutral
Buoyancy  Laboratory  at  the  Johnson  Space  Center  in  Texas  practicing  skills  and
choreographing  each  maneuver.  The  contributions  of  thousands  of  highly  trained
people from across our Nation and around the world need to be seamlessly brought
together to develop integrated mission operations plans with our international part-
ners, to properly equip and train ground and flight crews, and to coordinate launch
and mission support activities across six continents.

Our two biggest challenges over the next few years are maintaining the hard-won
critical  skills  we  need  to  safely  fly  out  the  Shuttle  manifest  and  helping  our  work-
force make a smooth transition to the post-Shuttle era. To address this concern, we
have  benchmarked  other  enterprises  that  have  shut  down  major  operations  to  im-
plement  best  practices  to  retain  our  critical  people.  Although  financial  incentives
can  play  a  key  role  in  employee  retention,  our  best  tool  to  retain  employees  is  to
provide meaningful and challenging work. We are doing this now through the chal-
lenging and exciting ISS assembly missions. Looking towards the future through re-
training,  job  rotations,  and  other  mechanisms,  we  are  working  hard  to  give  people
an  opportunity  to  transition  the  skills  learned  flying  the  Shuttle  to  the  design  and
operation of the next generation of vehicles.

When we fly systems as capable and as complex as the Space Shuttle and the ISS
in  such  a  dynamic  environment,  we  have  to  always  be  prepared  for  the  unexpected
and  agile  enough  to  react  quickly  and  effectively.  For  example,  weather  consider-
ations  often  play  an  important  role  in  our  mission  planning,  and  severe  weather
conditions  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  our  operations.  Such  was  the  case  on
February  26,  when  an  intense  hailstorm  struck  the  STS–117  vehicle  as  it  was  sit-
ting  on  the  launch  pad  and  caused  extensive  damage  to  the  foam  on  the  external
tank.

That  damage  forced  a  roll-back  to  the  Vehicle  Assembly  Building,  where  crews
could build work platforms for controlled access to the vehicle. Within three months,
NASA engineers and technicians analyzed over 6,000 discreet areas of foam damage,
developed  special  tools  and  techniques  and  made  repairs  where  necessary.  Though
the  damage  to  the  tank  was  extensive,  our  experience  with  various  external  tank
foam repair techniques—combined with the powerful analytical tools developed dur-
ing  Return  to  Flight  activities—enabled  us  to  do  the  analysis  and  repairs  swiftly
and with a high degree of engineering confidence.

Over  the  coming  years,  NASA  will  need  to  remain  agile  and  focused  on  technical
excellence  if  the  Agency  is  to  complete  the  important  work  that  is  in  front  of  us.
NASA  has  13  missions  on  the  manifest  over  the  next  38  months,  including  12  as-
sembly  flights  to  the  ISS  and  a  servicing  flight  to  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.
NASA  could  potentially  also  fly  up  to  two  contingency  logistics  flights  to  the  ISS
to  preposition  spares  for  the  post-Shuttle  era  if  these  flights  are  deemed  necessary
and  can  be  flown  before  the  end  of  2010.  Even  if  NASA  flies  both  contingency
flights, the pace (which equates to four or five flights a year between 2008 and 2010)
would  still  be  consistent  with  the  Agency’s  recent  experience  in  flying  three  Space
Shuttle missions (STS–121, –115, and –116) during the last six months of 2006.

Barring  further  significant  disruptions,  NASA  should  be  able  to  recover  from  the
STS–117  launch  delay  and  be  back  to  plan  by  mid-2008.  The  rule  that  we  will  al-
ways follow is that, ‘‘We will fly only when we are ready to fly. As always, the safety
of our crew members is our paramount consideration.’’

The  next  mission,  STS–118  (ISS–13A.1),  to  deliver  and  install  the  S5  truss  seg-
ment,  is  in  the  final  stages  of  preparation  at  Launch  Complex–39A  at  KSC.  Al-
though  STS–118  is  targeted  to  be  launched  on  August  7,  we  are  mindful  that  the
Phoenix  Mars  Lander  Mission,  scheduled  to  be  launched  from  Cape  Canaveral  on
a Delta II on August 3, has a 20-day planetary launch window that, once it expires,
does  not  return  for  two  years.  STS–118  is  the  first  flight  of  Endeavour  since  the
fall of 2002, and the vehicle has received sufficient structural inspections and modi-
fications  to  enable  it  to  fly  through  2010  without  additional  major  modifications.
During this flight, Endeavour will, for the first time, use the Global Positioning Sys-
tem  for  navigation  purposes  and  power  generated  by  the  ISS  solar  arrays  while
docked to the ISS.

Two more missions are scheduled for flight this year. During STS–120 (ISS–10A)
in  October,  Discovery  will  carry  Node  2  to  the  ISS.  Installing  Node  2  will  be  ex-
tremely challenging both during the Shuttle mission and afterwards, with two EVAs
scheduled to reposition the node after the Shuttle departs ISS. While the next mis-
sion  still  may  need  to  be  moved  slightly,  the  December  launch  of  STS–122  (ISS–
1E)  will  see  Atlantis  transporting  the  European  Space  Agency’s  Columbus  module.
As  we  continue  our  preparations  for  these  upcoming  flights,  we  are  also  continu-
ously improving the overall safety of the Space Shuttle system. Substantial progress
has been made in preparing two important upgrades for deployment into the fleet—
the Advanced Health Monitoring System (AHMS), and redesigns to the thermal pro-
tection  system  on  the  external  tank.  The  first,  AHMS,  is  an  upgrade  to  the  Space
Shuttle main engines, one of the most complex elements of the Space Shuttle system
and  one  of  our  highest  areas  of  interest  from  an  overall  probabilistic  risk  perspec-
tive.  Specifically,  AHMS  improves  our  ability  to  monitor  the  performance  of  the
Space Shuttle main engines during flight and, under certain circumstances, can ini-
tiate a controlled shutdown of a suspect main engine during ascent. An AHMS con-
troller was flown for the first time in a passive, monitoring mode on one engine for
STS–116  in  December,  2006,  then  in  an  active  (control)  mode  on  one  engine  for
STS–117 in June. AHMS controllers will be installed and in active mode on all three
engines starting with STS–118.

A  second  improvement  effort  has  focused  on  continuing  to  reduce  the  debris  risk
posed  by  foam  being  released  from  the  external  tank  during  ascent.  In  addition  to
our continuous foam application process improvement efforts, we recently completed
a critical design review for changes to the liquid hydrogen ice-frost ramps and liquid
oxygen feedline bracket. The new ice-frost ramp design will be implemented on Ex-
ternal  Tank  120,  currently  scheduled  to  support  mission  STS–120  later  this  year.
The ice-frost ramp and the feedline bracket redesigns will be flown together on Ex-
ternal  Tank  128,  which  will  be  flown  before  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  servicing
mission currently scheduled for September 2008.
Summary

I  believe  that  we  are  living  in  one  of  the  most  exciting  eras  so  far  in  the  history
of  space  exploration.  There  are  challenges  in  front  of  us,  to  be  sure,  and  we  will
have to be ready to respond to the unexpected. But no one is more prepared to con-
front  and  overcome  these  challenges  than  the  international  team  of  engineers  and
technicians  that  are  flying  the  ISS  and  the  Space  Shuttle  today.  And  as  we  look
towards  future  flights  to  the  Moon,  Mars,  and  beyond  (where  self-sufficiency,  inde-
pendency  and,  above  all,  adaptability  will  mark  the  difference  between  success  and
failure),  I  can  think  of  no  better  preparation  than  the  work  we’re  doing  right  now
to complete the ISS and take best advantage of this unique research facility.

I  would  be  pleased  to  respond  to  any  question  you  or  the  other  Members  of  the

Subcommittee may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR WILLIAM H. GERSTENMAIER

William H. Gerstenmaier is the Associate Administrator for Space Operations. In
this position, Gerstenmaier directs NASA’s human exploration of space. He also has
programmatic  oversight  for  the  International  Space  Station,  Space  Shuttle,  space
communications and space launch vehicles.

Formerly Gerstenmaier was the program manager of the International Space Sta-
tion  Office  at  NASA’s  Johnson  Space  Center  in  Houston,  and  was  responsible  for
the  overall  management,  development,  integration,  and  operation  of  the  Inter-
national Space Station.

In  1977,  Gerstenmaier  began  his  NASA  career  at  the  Glenn  Research  Center  in
Cleveland,  Ohio,  performing  aeronautical  research.  He  was  involved  with  the  wind
tunnel tests that were used to develop the calibration curves for the air data probes
used during entry on the Space Shuttle.

Beginning in 1988, Gerstenmaier headed the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV)
Operations Office, Systems Division at Johnson Space Center, where he was respon-
sible  for  all  aspects  of  OMV  operations.  Subsequently,  he  headed  Space  Shuttle/
Space  Station  Freedom  Assembly  Operations  Office,  Operations  Division  and  was
Chief, Projects and Facilities Branch, Flight Design and Dynamics Division.

Gerstenmaier also served as Shuttle/Mir Program Operations Manager from 1995
to  1997.  During  this  time  he  was  the  primary  liaison  to  the  Russian  Space  Agency
for operational issues and negotiated all protocols used in support of operations dur-
ing  the  Shuttle/Mir  missions.  In  addition,  he  supported  NASA  2  operations  from
Russia, January–September 1996.

In  1998,  Gerstenmaier  became  manager  of  Space  Shuttle  Program  Integration,
where  he  was  responsible  for  the  overall  management,  integration,  and  operations.
In  December  2000,  he  was  named  deputy  manager  of  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion Program.

Gerstenmaier  received  a  Bachelor  of  Science  in  aeronautical  engineering  from
Purdue  University  in  1977  and  a  Master  of  Science  degree  in  mechanical  engineer-
ing  from  the  University  of  Toledo  in  1981.  In  1992  and  1993,  he  completed  course
work for a doctorate in dynamics and control with emphasis in propulsion at Purdue
University.

Gerstenmaier is the recipient of numerous awards, including three NASA Certifi-
cates of Commendation, two NASA Exceptional Service Medals, a Senior NASA Out-
standing  Leadership  Medal,  and  the  Presidential  Rank  Award  for  Meritorious  Ex-
ecutives. He also was honored with an Outstanding Aerospace Engineer Award from
Purdue  University,  and  additionally,  twice  by  Aviation  Week  and  Space  for  Out-
standing Achievement in the Field of Space.

He is married to the former Marsha Ann Johnson. They have two children.
Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Gerstenmaier.
Mr. Holloway, the floor is yours. If you would turn on your mike,

Mr. Holloway.

Mr. HOLLOWAY. Thank you.
Chairman UDALL. That is better. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF MR. TOMMY W. HOLLOWAY, CHAIRMAN, ISS

INDEPENDENT SAFETY TASK FORCE

Mr.  HOLLOWAY.  Chairman  Udall  and  Ranking  Member  Mr.
Feeney,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today.
I will report on the observations and recommendations of the Inter-
national  Space  Station  Independent  Safety  Task  Force.  I  will  call
it the task force.

As  required  by  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administra-
tion’s  Authorization  Act  of  2005,  the  task  force  was  formed  to  as-
sess  the  vulnerabilities  of  the  International  Space  Station  that
could  lead  to  is  destruction,  compromise  the  health  of  the  crew,  or
necessitate its premature abandonment.

The task force offered its recommendations in the form of a final
report  which  was  submitted  to  NASA  and  the  United  States  Con-
gress  in  February  of  2007.  These  recommendations,  if  followed,

23

should  strengthen  the  ISS  Program  by  increasing  the  likelihood  of
mission success and mitigating risks to crew safety or health.

I  also  should  stress  that  if  these,  for  the  recommendations  to  be
effective  for  the  ISS  to  remain  a  robust  and  health  program,  suffi-
cient support from the Administration and the Congress is required
to ensure that the resources are provided and the safety-critical as-
pects  of  the  ISS  assembly  and  operations  are  enabled  and  main-
tained.

ISS  is  an  extremely  large  and  complex  vehicle,  and  at  the  time
of the task force report had a current living volume of 15,000 cubic
feet and a weight of 455,000 pounds. Planned assembly will expand
that  to  33,125  cubic  feet  and  855,000  pounds.  Hardware  and  soft-
ware are developed and tested all over the world, launched in Flor-
ida  and  at  Baikonur,  and  assembled  on-orbit  at  an  altitude  of  ap-
proximately 215 nautical miles.

Major systems including electrical power, cooling, data handling,
and  navigational  control  are  distributed  throughout  the  Station
and  are  expanded  and  integrated  as  assembly  progresses.  Station
assembly to date has gone exceptionally well and is a tribute to the
ISS and Shuttle teams. Anomalies occur but are dealt with quickly
and  with  outstanding  results  as  demonstrated  in  December,  2006,
by  the  solar  wing  retraction  problem  where  the  space  walking  as-
tronauts assisted in the retraction of the jammed solar wing.

These factors plus result in a complex and a distributed program
with  a  highly  technical  and  distributed  management  system  that
must be staffed by highly-skilled engineers and skilled and experi-
enced  managers.  Maintaining  critical  technical  and  management
skills  in  the  ISS  Program  as  the  ISS  matures  and  NASA’s  explo-
ration program staff up will be a challenge requiring proactive and
continuing attention by NASA management.

The ISS on-orbit vehicle is a robust and to the extent practicable,
meets  a  two  failure-tolerance  requirement  to  minimize  the  likeli-
hood  of  a  catastrophic  event.  The  Russians  and  the  U.S.  systems
provide  robust  redundancy  from  dissimilar  hardware  and  designs
in  critical  systems  such  as  guidance,  navigation,  and  control,  envi-
ronmental  control  and  lift  support,  and  crew/cargo  transportation.
For  most  safety-related  issues,  time  is  available  to  mitigate
vulnerabilities  by  switching  to  redundant  systems,  performing
maintenance  repairs  by  the  crew,  or  relying  on  consumable  re-
serves until a future logistics flight can be launched to the Station.
Time-critical  exceptions  to  these  failure  tolerances  are  uncon-
trolled  fire,  collision  with  micrometeoroid  or  orbital  debris,  toxic
spills,  or  collision  with  a  visiting  vehicle.  However,  the  task  force
found  that  the  system’s  design,  testing,  and  adherence  to  oper-
ational procedures provide adequate controls or that adequate miti-
gations are being developed by NASA for these conditions.

I  will  now  summarize  the  principal  observations  and  rec-

ommendations of the task force. First of all, the observations.

The  International  Space  Station  is  currently  a  robust  and  sound
program  with  respect  to  safety  and  crew  health.  Safety  and  crew
health  issues  are  well  documented  and  acceptable  and  are  either
adequately  controlled  or  mitigations  are  being  developed  to  main-
tain acceptable risks.

The ISS program has strong and proactive crosscutting functions
that,  if  continued,  should  provide  adequate  indications  and  warn-
ings  that  will  avoid  events  that  might  lead  to  destructions  of  the
Station.

The  International  Space  Station  currently  has  an  experienced
and  knowledgeable  and  proactive  team,  both  internally  and  in  in-
stitutional technical checks and balances, that provides the defense
for process and management failures that might lead to a safety or
health issue. This posture must be maintained to continue the Sta-
tion’s successful operations.

Micrometeoroid and orbital debris penetrating the living quarters
or  damaging  critical  equipment  is  highly,  a  high  safety  risk  to  the
crew and the Station.

There  are  significant  programmatic  risks  associated  with  com-
pleting the ISS Shuttle manifest and providing robust post-Shuttle
logistics capability that threaten the ability to support a viable sta-
tion.

Design,  development,  and  certification  of  the  new  COTS  System
capability  for  ISS  re-supply  are  just  beginning.  If  similar  to  other
new  programs,  it  most  likely  will  take  much  longer  and  cost  much
more.

Current  International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulation  restrictions  on
NASA are a threat to the safe and successful integration and oper-
ation of International Space Station.

Principle recommendation of the task force are the International
Space Station Program should place the highest priority on options
to decrease the risk of micrometeoroid and orbital debris.

NASA  should  develop  and  implement  plans  to  maintain  Station

critical skills and experienced managers.

The  Administration,  Congress,  and  NASA  should  support  the
completion  of  the  current  Shuttle  manifest  to  the  International
Space  Station,  including  ULF–4  and  ULF–5  to  assemble  a  viable
station and provide spares for the long-term operations.

The  Administration,  Congress,  and  NASA  should  support  a
proactive and phased post-Shuttle logistics transportation program,
including  adequate  funding  to  insure  that  adequate  logistics  and
spares are available to maintain a viable Station.

Department  of  State  should  grant  immediate  relief  from  the
International Traffic in Arms Regulation restrictions in the form of
an  exception  to  allow  NASA  contractors  to  direct  interaction  with
the  International  Space  Station’s  International  Partners  and  their
contractor.

Other  details  of  the  principle  recommendations  as  well  as  addi-
tional  recommendations  can  be  found  in  the  body  of  the  report,
‘‘Final Report of the IISTF Task Force.’’

And  finally,  it  should  be  noted  that  NASA’s  support  and  respon-
siveness  to  the  task  force  was  excellent  through  the  process  of  de-
veloping  the  data  and  material  required  to  accomplish  the  charter
of  the  task  force.  The  program  manager  and  his  team  supported
the  technical  review  meetings  and  provide  invaluable  insight  and
technical data on the issues associated with the task force charter.

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF TOMMY W. HOLLOWAY

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to  appear  before  you  today.  I  will  report  to  you  on  the  observations  and  rec-
ommendations  of  the  International  Space  Station  Independent  Safety  Task  Force.
As  required  by  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  Au-
thorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–155), the International Space Station Inde-
pendent Safety Task Force (IISTF) was formed to assess vulnerabilities of the Inter-
national  Space  Station  (ISS)  that  could  lead  to  its  destruction,  compromise  the
health  of  its  crew,  or  necessitate  its  premature  abandonment.  The  Task  Force  of-
fered  its  recommendations  in  the  form  of  its  final  report  which  was  submitted  to
NASA  and  the  United  States  Congress  in  February  of  2007.  The  Task  Force  rec-
ommendations,  if  followed,  should  strengthen  the  ISS  Program  by  increasing  the
likelihood of mission success and mitigating risks to crew safety or health. It is im-
portant  to  stress  that,  for  these  recommendations  to  be  effective  and  for  the  ISS  to
remain  a  robust  and  healthy  Program,  sufficient  support  from  the  Administration
and  Congress  is  required  to  ensure  that  resources  are  provided  and  the  safety-crit-
ical aspects of ISS assembly and operations are enabled and maintained.

The ISS Program is an international partnership comprised of the United States,
Russia,  Canada,  the  members  of  the  European  Space  Agency,  and  Japan.  Some  16
countries are in the partnership or involved via bilateral agreements with a Partner
in building, operating, and using the ISS. This partnership will continue throughout
the operational (post-assembly) phase of the Program, where NASA will continue to
be responsible for the sustaining engineering, operation of NASA’s elements, and in-
tegration of the Station.

The  ISS  is  an  extremely  large  and  complex  vehicle  and  at  the  time  of  the  IISTF
report  had  a  current  living  volume  of  15,000  cubic  feet  and  a  weight  of  455,000
pounds.  Planned  assembly  will  expand  it  to  33,125  cubic  feet  and  855,000  pounds.
Hardware and software are developed and tested all over the world and are assem-
bled and operated on orbit at an altitude of approximately 215 nautical miles. Major
systems  including  electrical  power,  cooling,  data  handling,  and  navigational  control
are  distributed  throughout  the  Station  and  are  expanded  as  assembly  progresses.
Station assembly to date has gone exceptionally well and is a tribute to the ISS and
Shuttle teams. Anomalies occur but are dealt with quickly and with outstanding re-
sults  as  demonstrated  in  December  2006  by  the  solar  wing  retraction  problem  on
ISS flight 12A.1/STS–116, where the spacewalking astronauts assisted in the retrac-
tion of the jammed solar array wing.

These factors result in a complex and distributed program with a highly technical
and  distributed  management  system  that  must  be  staffed  by  highly  skilled  engi-
neers  and  skilled,  experienced  managers.  Maintaining  critical  technical  and  man-
agement skills in the ISS Program as the ISS matures and NASA’s exploration pro-
gram  staffs  up  will  be  a  challenge  requiring  proactive  and  continuing  attention  by
NASA management.

NASA  depends  heavily  on  U.S.  contractors  for  technical  support  of  Station  inte-
gration and for vehicle operations. These contractors are the source of data and ex-
pertise that are critical in ensuring mission safety and success, and their timely par-
ticipation is essential to meeting mission schedules. Due to the international nature
of the ISS Program, this support requires mandatory interfaces with NASA’s Inter-
national Partners (IPs).

Currently the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) restrictions and IP
objections  to  signing  what  the  IPs  believe  are  redundant  Technical  Assistance
Agreements are a threat to the safe and successful integration and operation of the
Station. For example, a contractor workforce comprises a majority of the operations
workforce  and  must  be  able  to  have  a  direct  interface  with  the  IP  operations  team
to  assure  safe  and  successful  operations.  Their  interactions  and  their  ability  to  ex-
change  and  discuss  technical  data  relevant  to  vehicle  operations  are  severely  ham-
pered  by  the  current  ITAR  restrictions.  This  is  an  issue  across  the  ISS  Program,
but must be resolved soon to allow operations training for the first flight of the Eu-
ropean  Space  Agency’s  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  (ATV)  in  the  first  part  of  2008.
The ISS on-orbit vehicle is robust and, to the extent practicable, meets a two fail-
ure-tolerance  requirement  to  minimize  the  likelihood  of  catastrophic  events.  The
Russian and U.S. systems provide robust redundancy from dissimilar hardware and
designs in critical systems such as guidance, navigation, and control; environmental
control  and  life  support;  and  crew/cargo  transportation.  For  most  safety-related
issues,  time  is  available  to  mitigate  vulnerabilities  by  switching  to  redundant  sys-
tems,  performing  maintenance/repairs  by  the  crew,  or  relying  on  consumables  re-
serves until a future logistics flight can be launched to the Station.

Time-critical  exceptions  to  the  failure  tolerance  requirements  are  uncontrolled
fire,  collision  with  micrometeoroid  and  orbital  debris  (MMOD)  leading  to  a  major
loss  of  cabin  pressure,  toxic  spills,  or  a  collision  with  a  visiting  vehicle.  However,
the  Task  Force  found  that  systems  design,  testing,  and  adherence  to  operational
procedures  either  provide  adequate  controls  or  that  adequate  mitigations  are  being
developed for these conditions. For example, the risk of MMOD penetrating the ISS
in  its  Assembly  Complete  configuration  is  55  percent  with  a  nine  percent  risk  of  a
catastrophic result over a 10-year period. This risk can be reduced to 29 percent and
five  percent  respectively  by  implementation  of  changes  that  are  available  or  being
considered for development. It must be recognized that regardless of the efforts put
forth,  operating  in  space  is,  and  will  be  for  the  foreseeable  future,  inherently  risky
and requires continuing discipline and diligence to maintain safe operations.

The transition from the space Shuttle to post-Shuttle system(s) for logistical sup-
port  to  the  ISS  will  require  careful  planning  and  phasing  of  new  capabilities  to  en-
sure  adequate  logistics  and  spares  are  provided  to  maintain  a  viable  Station.  Ap-
proximately 160,000 pounds of logistics and spares must be transported to the Sta-
tion  between  2010  and  2015  by  the  Russian  Progress  or  emerging  transportation
systems.  The  Program’s  IP’s  have  committed  to  launch  40,000  pounds  of  this  re-
quired 160,000-pound requirement. Premature commitment to emerging logistics de-
livery capability—if it does not materialize—could result in the loss of logistics sup-
port  to  the  ISS  for  some  time.  Inadequate  logistics  will  result  in  a  serious  decrease
in the utility of the Station and could result in its abandonment.

The  ISS  Program  has  excellent  processes  and  mechanisms  in  place  on  multiple
fronts  to  ensure  proper  Program  execution.  A  major  component  of  avoiding  cata-
strophic  problems  is  continued  diligence  in  monitoring  the  ISS  system  including
hardware  design,  software  development,  flight  preparation,  and  flight  operations  to
detect  and  avoid  unknown  problems  or  inadequately  defined  operational  environ-
ments. The ISS Program must maintain its current level of diligence throughout the
life  of  the  Station,  never  letting  previous  successes  lead  to  a  compromise  in  the  re-
quired level of support or attention to detail. NASA manages the health of ISS flight
crews with intensive pre-flight medical screening, certification as ‘‘fit to fly,’’ regular
in-flight  health  monitoring,  and  a  limited  capability  to  diagnose  and  treat  illness
and injuries on board. In a worst-case scenario, a spontaneous health event may ne-
cessitate returning the crew to Earth for specialized medical attention, which would
result in temporary abandonment of the ISS. Analogue environment data (i.e., Ant-
arctica and submarine populations) and astronaut health events on the ground indi-
cate that, with an ISS crew of six, the Program might expect a spontaneous medical
event requiring medical evacuation once every four to six years.
Principal Observations

1. The  International  Space  Station  Program  is  currently  a  robust  and  sound
program  with  respect  to  safety  and  crew  health.  Safety  and  crew  health
issues  are  well  documented  and  acceptable,  and  are  either  currently  ade-
quately controlled or mitigations are being developed to maintain acceptable
risk levels.

2. The  International  Space  Station  Program  has  strong  and  proactive  cross-
cutting functions that—if continued—should provide advance indications and
warnings that will avoid events that might lead to destruction of the Station,
loss of the Station crew, abandonment of the Station, or development of unto-
ward  crew  health  issues.  The  International  Space  Station  Program’s  oper-
ating procedures and processes are thorough and sound.

3. The  International  Space  Station  currently  has  an  experienced,  knowledge-
able,  and  proactive  team,  both  internally  and  in  its  institutional  technical
checks  and  balances,  that  provides  the  defense  for  process  and  management
failures  that  might  lead  to  an  ISS  safety  or  major  crew  health  issue.  This
posture  must  be  maintained  to  continue  the  Station’s  successful  operation.
4. Micrometeoroid  and  orbital  debris  penetrating  the  living  quarters  or  dam-
aging  critical  equipment  is  a  high  safety  risk  to  the  crew  and  the  Station.
5. Spontaneous  crew  illness  is  a  significant  crew  risk  and  may  necessitate  re-
turning the crew to Earth for specialized medical attention, which would re-
sult  in  temporary  abandonment  of  the  Station.  International  Space  Station
medical  and  Program  management  officials  are  taking  all  reasonable  pre-
cautions to minimize this risk.

6. There are significant programmatic risks associated with completing the ISS
Shuttle manifest and providing robust post-Shuttle logistics capabilities that
threaten the ability to support a viable Station.

7. Workforce composition is a growing concern throughout NASA because of the
technical and specialized nature of most of the agency’s work and the large-
scale  program  transition  now  under  way.  The  International  Space  Station
Program is vulnerable to critical management losses, making strategic work-
force planning as important as ever.

8. Design, development, and certification of the new Commercial Orbital Trans-
portation  System  capability  for  ISS  re-supply  are  just  beginning.  If  similar
to  other  new  program  development  activities,  it  most  likely  will  take  much
longer than expected and will cost more than anticipated.

9. The  current  International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulation  restrictions  on  NASA
are  a  threat  to  the  safe  and  successful  integration  and  operations  of  the
International Space Station.

Principal Recommendations

• The International Space Station Program should place the highest priority on

options to decrease the risk of micrometeoroid and orbital debris.

• NASA should develop and implement plans to maintain Station critical skills

and experienced managers.

• The  Administration,  Congress,  and  NASA  should  support  the  completion  of
the  current  Shuttle  manifest  to  the  International  Space  Station,  including
flights  ULF–4  and  ULF–5,  to  assemble  a  viable  Station  and  provide  spares
for its long-term operation.

• The  Administration,  Congress,  and  NASA  should  support  a  proactive  and
phased  post-Shuttle  logistical  transportation  program,  including  adequate
funding of approximately one billion dollars per year above current allocations
to  ensure  that  adequate  logistics  and  spares  are  available  to  maintain  a  via-
ble Station.
• NASA  senior  management  should  conduct  a  comprehensive  review  of  the
Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  to  ensure  agreement  on  the  policies,  approach,
and technical implementation of the safety strategy for the Automated Trans-
fer Vehicle’s demonstration.
• The  Department  of  State  should  grant  immediate  relief  from  the  Inter-
national  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulation  restrictions  in  the  form  of  an  exemption
to  allow  NASA  contractors  direct  interaction  with  the  International  Space
Station’s  International  Partners  and  their  contractors.  This  must  be  affected
no  later  than  summer  2007  to  support  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  oper-
ations.
• The  ISS  Program  should  carefully  consider  implementing  all  IISTF  rec-
ommendations  to  improve  the  overall  safeguards  and  controls  against
vulnerabilities.

Further  details  on  the  principal  recommendations  as  well  as  additional  rec-
ommendations  can  be  found  in  the  body  of  the  report  ‘‘Final  Report  of  the  Inter-
national Space Station Independent Safety Task Force.’’

It should be noted that NASA’s support and responsiveness to the Task Force was
excellent through the process of developing the data and material required to accom-
plish  the  charter  of  the  IISTF.  The  Program  Manager  and  his  team  supported  the
technical review meetings and provided invaluable insight and technical data on the
issues associated with the IISTF’s charter.

With  respect  to  the  specific  questions  in  the  letter  inviting  me  to  testify  at  the
House  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology’s  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aero-
nautics the following is provided. My recommendations reflect the recommendations
documented in the Task Force’s report.
1. What are the most significant findings and recommendations of the International

Space Station Independent Safety Task Force?
The  principal  observations  and  recommendations  discussed  above  are  the  most

significant findings and recommendations.
2. What was NASA’s response to the Task Force’s findings, and are there particular

areas that you think require additional attention or action by NASA?
Per  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (Public  Law  109–155),  the  task  force’s
charter expired in February, 2007. No further exchange between the NASA and the
Task  Force  has  occurred  since  that  time.  Since  I  am  currently  a  private  citizen,  I
do  not  have  any  personal  insight  into  the  status  of  NASA’s  response  to  these  rec-

28

ommendations.  For  these  reasons,  I  cannot  comment  on  NASA’s  response  to  the
task force recommendations.
3. The Task Forces’ report indicates that the risk of a ‘‘catastrophic result’’ from colli-
sion with micrometeoroid and orbital debris could be reduced to five percent over
a 10-year period ‘‘by implementation of changes that are available or being consid-
ered  for  developed.’’  Is  NASA  in  fact  implementing  all  the  changes  you  reference,
and  if  not,  would  the  resulting  level  of  risk  be  acceptable  to  the  Task  Force?  In
any  event,  did  the  Task  Force  consider  the  five  percent  to  be  an  acceptable  level
of risk?
Per  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (Public  Law  109–155),  the  task  force’s
charter expired in February, 2007. No further exchange between the NASA and the
Task  Force  has  occurred  since  that  time.  Since  I  am  currently  a  private  citizen,  I
do  not  have  any  personal  insight  into  the  status  of  NASA’s  response  to  these  rec-
ommendations.  For  these  reasons,  I  cannot  comment  on  NASA’s  response  to  the
task force recommendations.

The ISS Program’s requirement of ‘‘five percent probability of no catastrophic pen-
etration’’  was  considered  by  the  Task  Force  to  be  reasonable  given  the  state-of-the-
art  in  shielding  design,  the  mass-to-orbit  limitations  and  the  state  of  the  develop-
ment and deployment of the ISS elements.
4. The Task Force report discusses the risk associated with post Shuttle logistics ca-

pabilities to support the ISS. What would you recommend?
I  would  develop  and  implement  a  fully  integrated  logistics  support  plan  with  off
and  on-ramps  of  available  and  planned  capability  for  the  logistics  support  for  the
Assembly  Complete/six  crew  member/post-Shuttle  era.  The  plan  would  include  pro-
jected  budget  requirements  for  logistics  support.  I  would  recommend  the  Adminis-
tration and the Congress support this plan.

I  would  not  commit  the  ISS  to  an  unproven  logistics  support  system  such  as
COTS.  If  a  proven  logistics  support  system  is  not  available,  I  would  commit  to  the
future  capability  that  is  determined  by  engineering  analysis  to  have  the  highest
chance of success until emerging capabilities are proven.

To  ensure  not  being  forced  into  dependency  on  an  unproven  capability  I  would
procure  additional  spare  proven  capability  to  assure  a  smooth  transition  to
unproven  capabilities  later  and  to  minimize  transition  through  down  periods  on  lo-
gistics delivery systems.

I  would  develop  an  option  that  ensures  that  the  two  remaining  Shuttle  exterior
logistics  flights  are  given  the  highest  priority  for  flight,  in  front  of  Node  3,  if  nec-
essary,  to  avoid  exacerbating  a  problem  should  all  planned  Shuttle  flights  not  be
completed.
5. Why does the Task force consider the current International Traffic in Arms Regu-
lations  restrictions  to  be  ‘‘a  threat  to  safe  and  successful  integration  and  oper-
ations  of  the  International  Space  Station,’’  and  what  would  you  recommend  be
done?
NASA  depends  heavily  on  U.S.  contractors  for  technical  support  for  Station  inte-
gration  and  for  operations.  These  contractors  are  the  source  of  data  and  expertise
that  is  critical  in  meeting  schedules  and  performing  mandatory  work  with  the  IPs.
For  example,  the  mission  operations  contractors  comprise  a  majority  of  the  oper-
ations workforce and must be able to have a direct interface with the IP operations
teams to assure safe and successful operations. Currently the ITAR restrictions and
the  IPs’  objections  to  signing  technical  assistance  agreements  are  a  threat  to  the
safe and successful integration and operations of the Station.

Each  U.S.  contractor  working  with  the  European,  Japanese,  and  Russian  space
agencies  is  required  to  apply  for  a  Technical  Assistance  Agreement  (TAA)  from  the
State Department that governs their interactions with foreign entities for each spe-
cific  relationship.  U.S.  aerospace  and  defense  companies  are  accustomed  to  dealing
with  these  TAA  requirements  in  what  has  become  a  normal  part  of  international
business.  However,  when  the  Department  of  State  approvals  are  too  narrowly  de-
fined  and  come  with  many  caveats,  limitations,  and  provisos,  they  severely  restrict
Program  management  flexibility.  The  constraints  imposed  by  the  current  processes
result  in  lost  time  and  opportunity  to  share  critical  data  to  enable  a  robust  joint
Program.

I  would  grant  immediate  relief  in  the  form  of  an  exemption  to  allow  NASA  con-
tractors direct interaction with the IPs and their contractors to facilitate and accom-
modate  all  engineering  and  safety  reviews,  data  exchanges  pertaining  to  specific
ATV/HTV hardware and software, Program management interactions, and flight op-
erations including anomaly resolution.

BIOGRAPHY FOR TOMMY W. HOLLOWAY

Mr. Holloway retired in 2002 as Manager of the International Space Station Pro-
gram  for  NASA’s  Johnson  Space  Center.  Mr.  Holloway  was  named  Space  Station
manager  in  April  1999  after  serving  as  Manager  of  the  Space  Shuttle  Program
(SSP)  for  nearly  four  years.  He  began  his  career  with  NASA  in  1963,  planning  ac-
tivities  for  Gemini  and  Apollo  flights.  He  was  a  Flight  Director  in  Mission  Control
for  early  Space  Shuttle  flights  and  became  Chief  of  that  office  in  1985.  In  1989,  he
was  named  Assistant  Director  for  the  SSP  for  the  Mission  Operations  Directorate.
He  served  as  Deputy  Manager  for  Program  Integration  with  the  SSP  and  Director
of  the  Phase  1  program  of  Shuttle-Mir  dockings  before  being  named  SSP  Manager
in August 1995. He served on the National Research Counsel Committee on Assess-
ment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope (2004–2005).
He  received  his  B.S.  in  Mechanical  Engineering  from  the  University  of  Arkansas
and  has  earned  numerous  honors  and  awards  including  Presidential  Meritorious
and  Distinguished  Ranks,  the  Robert  R.  Gilruth  Award,  and  the  Rotary  National
Space Trophy.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Holloway.
Dr. Neitzel, the floor is yours.

STATEMENT OF DR. G. PAUL NEITZEL, PROFESSOR OF FLUID

MECHANICS, GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

Dr.  NEITZEL.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member  Feeney  and
members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify
before  you  today  on  these  important  matters  relating  to  the  Space
Shuttle and the International Space Station.

My name is Paul Neitzel. I am a Professor of fluid mechanics and
mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech. I am here today as a rep-
resentative  of  NASA’s  external  research  community  and  shall  do
my best to communicate to you some of these, its concerns.

The International Space Station or ISS has always been justified
in large part as providing an experimental platform operating in a
unique environment of weightlessness or microgravity to permit re-
search  relevant  to  future  human  space  exploration  as  well  as  fun-
damental  and  applied  research  that  can  increase  our  under-
standing of certain phenomena, potentially leading to enhanced ter-
restrial applications.

NASA  through  the  1990’s  had  developed  an  impressive  external
research community in the life and physical sciences to investigate
such  questions.  This  growth  was  a  conscious  decision  on  the  part
of  the  agency,  made  both  to  access  new  ideas  and  to  expand  the
ground-based  research  program  to  insure  that  the  very  best
projects  requiring  access  to  microgravity  could  be  identified  and
subsequently  flown.  This  community  included  the  best  researchers
in  the  United  States  in  their  respective  fields.  In  the  2003  Office
of Biological and Physical Research Task Book, more than 1,700 co-
investigators and nearly 3,000 students were identified as working
on roughly 1,000 tasks.

In the aftermath of the tragic loss of the Columbia and her crew
in  February,  2003,  and  the  mission  shift  resulting  from  President
Bush’s  2004  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  NASA  made  a  decision
to  terminate  all  external,  non-exploration  research  and  to  signifi-
cantly  cut  back  on  the  number  of  external  exploration  projects,  ef-
fectively  wiping  out  the  community  of  researchers  that  had  been
assembled.

Some of NASA’s rationale for doing this is understandable, given
the loss of a vehicle with which to continue the assembly of the ISS

and  the  minimum  budget  plus-up  of  $1  billion  over  five  years  de-
voted to the implementation of the vision. NASA is an agency that
is always being asked to accomplish too much with too little. How-
ever, it is my belief that NASA’s decision to proceed in this fashion
is  shortsighted  and  inconsistent  with  developing  the  types  of  sys-
tems  that  will  best  allow  us  to  return  to  the  Moon  between  2015,
and 2020, and prepare for more ambitious missions.

The vast majority of fundamental and applied scientific research
in this country is conducted at colleges and universities, where fac-
ulty  work  in  conjunction  with  students  from  undergraduates  to
post-doctoral research fellows, to make the breakthroughs that help
drive  our  economy.  By  shutting  out  input  from  this  community
NASA  not  only  denies  itself  access  to  potentially  groundbreaking
results of relevance to its mission, it also effectively guarantees the
future workers it will require will be neither motivated to work on
NASA-related problems, nor even be knowledgeable of them.

In  addition,  the  hundreds  of  researchers  who  have  had  their
NASA  research  programs  terminated  are  moving  onto  other  pur-
suits and are likely to be unable, if even willing, to return to prob-
lems NASA will need to have solved in the future.

The  restriction  to  a  small  number  of  exploration-related  projects
is also likely to cause NASA to lock into choices at an earlier time
than it should for systems currently under development. Consistent
with the President’s Vision, NASA should be exploring the develop-
ment  of  systems  that  will  permit  future  missions  that  may  be  of
much longer duration than a trip from here to the Moon. Such mis-
sions  will  require  the  development  of  new,  mass-efficient,  dual-use
systems  that  will  accomplish  their  functions  both  on  a  reduced-
gravity,  heavenly  body  as  well  as  during  the  extensive  period  of
zero gravity required to get here. ISS is the only research platform
capable of investigating the latter regime.

Finally, the elimination of fundamental ground-based and micro-
gravity  research  denies  the  agency  and  the  country  the  possibility
of  results  from  curiosity-driven  research  that  has  been  the  hall-
mark  of  academic  research  throughout  history.  Such  work  may  or
may  not  have  immediate  application.  Fundamental  work  done  by
Lord  Rayleigh  on  the  breakup  of  liquid  jets  roughly  100  year  ago
forms  the  basis  of  technology  used  in  both  the  inkjet-printing  and
rapid-prototyping devices of today.

NASA’s plans for the utilization of the ISS by researchers funded
by  other  federal  agencies  are,  in  my  opinion,  unrealistic  at  this
point  in  time  given  the  long  lead  times  required  to  develop  flight
hardware and the finite lifetime of the ISS. The ISS National Lab-
oratory  concept,  while  one  I  support,  is  but  a  hollow  shell  without
dedicated  funding  to  enable  both  the  research  to  be  done  on  ISS
and the expensive costs of transporting experiments to and from it.
This  funding,  furthermore,  must  be  fenced  off  from  the  standard
NASA  budget  to  prevent  it  from  being  redirected  by  the  agency  to
other needs.

Without a vigorous program of ground- and space-based research
designed  to  exploit  the  unique  environment  of  the  ISS,  we  are
squandering  this  valuable  resource.  We  are  potentially  relin-
quishing  our  leadership  in  space-based  research  to  other  nations,

31

and  we  are  dimming  the  spark  of  discovery  that  motivated  many
of the current generation of such researchers, including yours truly.
Thank  you  again,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  the  opportunity  to  appear
here  today.  I  am  happy  to  try  to  answer  any  questions  the  Sub-
committee may have.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Neitzel follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF G. PAUL NEITZEL

Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Feeney  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee:
thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  testify  on  the  subject  of  ‘‘NASA’s  Space
Shuttle  and  International  Space  Station  Programs:  Status  and  Issues.’’  My  name  is
Paul  Neitzel  and  I  am  a  professor  of  fluid  mechanics  in  the  George  W.  Woodruff
School  of  Mechanical  Engineering  at  the  Georgia  Institute  of  Technology.  I  appear
today  as  a  member  of  the  NASA  external  research  community.  My  experience  as
a  principal  investigator  (PI)  on  NASA-sponsored  research  goes  back  more  than
twenty  years  and  I  have  had  the  occasion  to  serve  the  agency  in  several  advisory
capacities  over  that  period  of  time.  Of  particular  relevance  to  the  subject  of  today’s
hearing is my prior service on the Space Station Utilization Advisory Subcommittee
(1995–99) and on two groups (in 1999 and 2000) tasked to examine the management
of  research  aboard  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS).  In  my  written  testimony
below,  I  shall  address  some  of  the  issues  I  feel  are  important  to  ensure  that  the
full promise of the ISS as a research laboratory is realized.

The International Space Station is the culmination of America’s desire for a ‘‘per-
manent’’  research  facility  in  low-Earth  orbit  that  began  with  the  launch  of  Skylab
in  1973  and  continued  with  the  Shuttle-Mir  program.  The  final  incarnation  of  the
ISS  will  be  a  facility  built  with  the  cooperation  of  sixteen  partner  nations.  The  ISS
has  always  been  described,  among  other  things,  as  a  laboratory  for  performing  re-
search  under  the  weightless  conditions  of  free-fall,  both  to  enable  further  human
and  robotic  exploration  of  space  and  to  answer  fundamental  questions  that  could
lead to enhanced understanding of terrestrial phenomena, such as the influence and
interactions  of  forces  that  are  often  obscured  on  Earth  by  the  presence  of  gravity.
NASA’s  research  program  in  the  life  and  physical  sciences  began  modestly.  The
physical  sciences  program  grew  out  of  a  program  called  Materials  Processing  in
Space that sought to explore microgravity to produce materials of improved quality;
at  the  end  of  the  1980’s  only  about  70  physical  science  PIs  were  receiving  funding.
In  this  period,  there  was  pressure  on  the  PI  community  to  develop  flight  experi-
ments  to  ensure  that  payload  spaces  on  the  Space  Shuttle  were  full.  This  pressure
led to the development and flight of several (often very expensive) experiments that
were either poorly conceived, did not require the weightless environment to answer
the research questions, or both, leading to criticism from parts of the scientific com-
munity of the quality of NASA-sponsored science.

Beginning about 1989 and continuing through the 1990’s the former Office of Life
and  Microgravity  Science  and  Applications  (OLMSA)  made  a  conscious  decision  to
greatly expand its ground-based research program. The basis for this expansion was
to  broaden  the  participating  research  community  to  access  new  ideas  and  to  in-
crease the number of investigations to allow the best, most deserving candidates for
flight  experiments  to  percolate  up  through  the  pool.  This  decision  served  to  attract
a  much  broader  cross-section  of  the  life-  and  physical-science  research  communities
to  NASA-related  research,  leading  to  the  development  of  flight  experiments  truly
worthy  of  the  unique  resources  provided  by  the  Shuttle  and  the  ISS.  At  its  zenith
the  budget  of  the  then  Office  of  Biological  and  Physical  Research  (OBPR  is  what
OLMSA  morphed  into)  had  grown  to  approximately  $1B  and  the  FY03  OBPR  Task
Book  (http://peer1.nasaprs.com/search2003/metrics2003.cfm)  shows  a  broad  re-
search  program  containing  roughly  1,000  tasks,  supporting  over  1,700  PIs  and  co-
investigators  and  nearly  3,000  students,  ranging 
from  undergraduates  to
postdoctoral fellows. A summary from this document of the numbers of tasks, inves-
tigators and students supported is included as Table 1. In my own discipline of fluid
physics,  which  is  concerned  with  the  behaviors  of  liquids  and  gases,  I  can  state
without  hesitation  that  the  program  supported  the  very  best  researchers  in  the
United  States  and  had  far  surpassed  other  federal  agencies  as  the  principal  sup-
porter of fundamental and applied research in the field.

On Saturday, February 1, 2003, the Nation watched, horrified, as the Space Shut-
tle  Columbia  broke  apart  upon  reentry  following  a  successful  research  utilization
flight to the ISS. Needless to say, the tragic loss of the crew and their vehicle, along
with  the  time  lag  prior  to  return-to-flight  caused  serious  slippages  in  both  the  ISS
assembly sequence and the conduct of research aboard both the Shuttle and the ISS.

The  progress  of  research  was  further  exacerbated  by  the  decision  to  limit  the  crew
size  aboard  the  ISS  to  two  persons,  down  from  three  and  far  short  of  the  full  com-
plement of six, further negatively impacting research during the assembly phase.

In  January,  2004,  President  Bush  put  forth  his  Vision  for  Space  Exploration
(VSE,  or  ‘‘the  Vision,’’  for  short),  calling  for  the  completion  of  the  ISS  by  2010,  re-
tirement of the Shuttle at that time and the development of a new Crew Exploration
Vehicle  (CEV),  to  be  used  both  for  sorties  to  the  ISS  and  exploration  of  the  lunar
surface,  returning  humans  to  the  Moon  between  2015  and  2020.  Lunar  exploration
was further mentioned as permitting astronauts to develop new technologies as nec-
essary  a  stepping  stone  to  more  challenging  environments,  including  Mars.  The
funding for the Vision amounted to $12B over five years, $11B of which was to come
from reallocation of funds within NASA’s existing budget, with a $1B plus-up.

Although the life- and physical-science research program had begun to suffer from
decreased  funding  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Columbia  accident,  the  transition  to  the
implementation  of  VSE  was  its  death  knell.  In  December,  2005,  NASA  sent  letters
to  hundreds  of  investigators  in  the  program,  informing  them  of  significant  cuts  in
their  funding  for  FY06  and  the  termination  of  their  grants  effective  September  30,
2006. In line with the Vision, NASA decided that future agency-supported research
would  be  restricted  to  exploration  needs,  namely  the  study  of  ‘‘exploration  require-
ments  in  human  health  and  countermeasures  as  well  as  applied  physical  sciences
for  fire  prevention,  detection,  and  suppression;  multi-phase  flow  for  fluids  such  as
propellant; life support; and thermal control applications,’’ as stated in The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research and Utilization Plan for the
International Space Station (ISS) published last year. The small number of projects
being investigated, although relevant to exploration, is inconsistent with the conduct
of a robust, safe exploration program that will send astronauts to the Moon no soon-
er than 2015.

During  a  period  with  limited  flight  opportunities  and  a  major  shift  in  mission
focus,  precisely  the  opposite  should  be  occurring  within  NASA’s  research  programs.
I  shall  focus  on  the  physical  sciences  for  the  moment.  Long-duration  exploration
such  as  a  500  day  mission  to  Mars  requires  new  solutions  to  long-standing  prob-
lems. A principal limitation associated with such a mission is the up-mass that can
be accommodated with a given launch vehicle. For a 16-day Shuttle mission, a stay
aboard  the  ISS  with  regular  resupply,  or  even  a  lunar  outpost  permitting  periodic
re-supply,  existing  solutions  to  environmental  and  vehicle  needs  may  suffice.  For  a
Mars mission, however, every kilogram devoted to an environmental- or fire-control
system, for example, is one kilogram less that may be used for food and water. New
systems  for  Mars  missions  will  also  need  to  be  ‘‘dual-use,’’  in  that  they  will  need
to  be  able  to  function  for  an  extended  period  of  microgravity  during  flight  as  well
as  in  the  3/8  g  Martian  gravity.  Hence,  new,  more  mass-efficient  solutions  need  to
be sought for such problems and a robust program of both fundamental and applied
ground-based  research  should  be  able  to  identify  good  candidates  for  subsequent
flight  testing  and  development  as  the  ISS  facilities  become  available.  The  current
exploration research plan appears to be focused on the investigation of very limited
possibilities for such solutions, and is likely to yield less-than-optimal ones. The de-
cision to rush to development at this stage is hard to understand; in this era of in-
credibly  fast-paced  technological  development,  NASA  owes  it  to  itself  to  keep  as
many options open until it is absolutely necessary to start ‘‘cutting metal.’’

Under  the  2005  NASA  Authorization  Act,  NASA  has  been  directed  to  devote  15
percent  of  its  ISS  research  funds  to  non-exploration  research.  The  figure  for  FY07
includes  $3.1M  for  ISS  physical  science,  $1.7M  for  ISS  life  science,  $3.9M  for  re-
search  aboard  free-flyer  vehicles,  and  $3.3M  for  ground-based  grants,  for  a  total  of
$12M. This number is particularly small, in part, due to the fact that the 15 percent
is  mandated  to  come  from  the  ‘‘ISS  research’’  funds,  which  are  at  a  depressed  level
due to the inability to conduct meaningful amounts of research on the vehicle during
the  compressed  assembly  sequence.  As  a  comparison  point,  the  $3.3M  devoted  to
ground-based  research  would  support,  at  minimal  funding  levels,  roughly  30  PIs,  a
figure that can be compared with the numbers from the 2003 OBPR Task Book that
were  mentioned  above  and  included  in  Table  1,  namely,  roughly  1,000  tasks  sup-
porting  more  than  1,700  PIs  and  co-investigators  and  nearly  3,000  students.  Fur-
thermore,  the  non-exploration  fundamental  and  applied  research  that  could  be  con-
ducted  aboard  the  ISS  under  a  robust  research  program  aligns  perfectly  with  the
goals of the American Competitiveness Initiative.

The  recent  decimation  of  the  external  research  community  has  other  con-
sequences. First, NASA seems to regard research as a spigot that can be turned off
and  on  at  will.  I  would  agree  that  it  is  easy  to  turn  off  the  research  spigot  at  any
time, but in doing this, NASA is also shutting down the water-treatment plant that
supplies  the  spigot.  The  reestablishment  of  an  external  research  community  will

take  years,  if  it  can  be  accomplished  at  all.  My  colleagues  in  the  life  and  physical
sciences  have  a  variety  of  research  interests  for  which  funding  is  available  through
other  federal  agencies  as  well  as  from  private  industry.  The  very  best  members  of
the  research  community  are  moving  on  to  other  pursuits  and  are  not  likely  to  be
able, if even willing, to reengage in microgravity-related in the future.

Second, NASA is fond of speaking of the current crop of researchers who were mo-
tivated  to  pursue  careers  in  space-related  research  by  their  fascination  with  the
Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs that culminated in landing astronauts on the
Moon.  With  the  absence  of  NASA-oriented  research  programs  in  our  universities,
where  will  the  next  generation  of  these  researchers  come  from?  Those  of  us  in  the
higher-education  community  are  sensitive  to  the  fact  that  it  has  become  harder  to
attract,  and  most  importantly,  to  retain  American  students  to  study  mathematics,
engineering  and  the  sciences.  With  the  loss  of  motivators  such  as  the  possibility  of
a career in a vibrant, active, space-research program, one more incentive for future
students disappears. As mentioned already, the former OBPR research program pro-
vided  opportunities  for  nearly  3,000  U.S.  students  to  engage  in  meaningful  NASA-
related  life-  and  physical-science  research.  Other  nations,  notably  China,  are  in-
creasing  their  emphasis  on  space  research;  Asian  cultures,  in  general,  embrace  the
study  of  science  and  engineering.  As  we  stand  by  and  watch  jobs  and  technology
being transferred overseas, are we as a nation prepared to relinquish our superiority
in  space  research  and  in  the  associated  discoveries  that  can  drive  new  businesses
and jobs?

Finally, abandonment by NASA of the ISS as a platform for fundamental and ap-
plied external research with both exploration and non-exploration applications sends
an  unfavorable  message  to  the  international  partners  who  have  contributed  their
time and money to make the ISS a reality. How can the United States, in good con-
science, turn its back on these partners, not to mention the American taxpayers who
have  borne  the  bulk  of  these  expenses?  An  incredible  investment  of  both  time  and
money has been made, both in the ISS vehicle and in discipline-specific research fa-
cilities that are to be flown aboard it. These facilities exist, have already been paid
for, and are merely awaiting integration aboard the ISS to be used. We need to en-
sure that the ISS is fully utilized to the full term of its lifetime, currently projected
for  2015.  This  is  only  five  years  past  assembly-complete,  a  period  we  should  cer-
tainly be willing to sustain.

Last  year,  a  group  of  us  in  the  life  and  physical  sciences  were  asked  to  come  up
with a ‘‘keep-alive’’ dollar figure for the life- and physical-sciences research program.
The  figure  we  estimated  that  would  be  required  for  PI  support  was  roughly  $70M/
year. (This is exclusive of transportation costs and NASA Center personnel salaries
for  flight-experiment  support,  but  these  would  be  minimal  during  the  remainder  of
the  assembly  sequence.)  This  funding  level  would  support  a  research  effort  roughly
half the size of the research program that was in place immediately prior to the re-
cent  cutbacks.  This  $70M/year  amounts  to  less  than  $.25/year  from  each  American
citizen and less than 0.4 percent of NASA’s roughly $18B annual budget. This small
cost  of  maintaining  an  active  research  community  is  one  that  must  be  borne.  The
cost  of  losing  the  possible  accomplishments  of  an  entire  community  that  can  likely
never be reestablished is far greater.

Mr. Chairman, you have posed several questions in your invitation that you would
like me to address in my testimony. I shall respond to each, in turn, although some
of these responses will reiterate material covered in these opening remarks.
1. What  actions  does  NASA  need  to  undertake  to  ensure  that  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station  (ISS)  can  be  productively  utilized  for  explo-
ration-related  and  non-exploration-related  research  once  it  is  assem-
bled?  When  does  NASA  need  to  undertake  the  recommended  actions?
Which of the actions would you consider to be the most important to the
effective utilization of the ISS?
The  principal  need  to  ensure  productive  utilization  of  the  ISS  is  the  existence  of
a broad-based research community with projects in the pipeline. In addition to can-
didate flight experiments, this requires a substantial commitment to a ground-based
program  so  that  the  previous  mistakes  made  by  the  agency  described  in  the  intro-
duction above are not repeated. Because the process for taking a research idea from
conception  to  flight  typically  requires  several  years,  NASA  is  already  behind  in
terms  of  a  time  schedule  that  includes  a  2010  assembly-complete  date  for  the  ISS.
However,  given  that  several  projects  relating  to  both  exploration  and  fundamental/
applied  research  were  recently  active,  it  may  be  possible  to  resurrect  some  of  them
in  an  effort  to  jump-start  the  reformation  of  a  broader  research  community.  To  re-
establish  such  a  community,  NASA  must  commit  to  the  long-term  research  utiliza-
tion of ISS; those who were left at the altar by NASA this past time will be uneasy

about  returning  in  the  absence  of  such  a  commitment.  Many  who  have  moved  on
to other pursuits will not be able to return to NASA research due to their new com-
mitments.
2.  Does  NASA  have  well  defined  objectives  for  utilizing  the  ISS,  and  are
NASA’s  facilities,  plans,  resource  allocations,  and  research  criteria  and
prioritization for utilization aligned with those objectives?

NASA’s  utilization  plan  calls  for  a  research  focus  for  the  ISS  that  is  restricted  to
exploration  goals  in  support  of  the  VSE.  The  small  number  of  investigations  out-
lined  in  NASA’s  aforementioned  ISS  Research  and  Utilization  Plan  is  inconsistent
with  an  effective,  safe  exploration  program.  In  the  fire-safety  arena  alone,  NASA
should be exploring fundamental and applied research in a broad range of the field
of  combustion  to  guarantee  that  the  very  best  techniques  for  fire  prevention,  detec-
tion  and  suppression  are  developed.  As  pointed  out  in  the  recent  NRC  report  enti-
tled,  Review  of  NASA  Plans  for  the  International  Space  Station,  the  risk  of  a  fire
incident  on  a  long-term  mission  such  as  one  to  Mars  is  high.  Not  only  must  space-
craft  have  the  best  technologies  on-board  for  prevention,  detection  and  suppression
of  fires,  they  must  be  prepared  to  rid  the  spacecraft  environment  of  potentially
harmful soot and other products of combustion in the event a fire does occur. Stud-
ies of relevance to this also have applications to microgravity dust management and
its effect on both humans and equipment functionality. Earthbound applications in-
clude clean-room technology, handling of nanoparticles, the detection of nanoparticle
health hazards and improved fire-detection equipment.

Mass  efficiency  of  other  types  of  exploration-related  hardware  is  a  general  con-
cern.  For  example,  NASA  knows  how  to  move  liquids  from  one  location  to  another
within the spacecraft environment, but are the most mass-efficient means for accom-
plishing  these  tasks  being  developed?  The  VSE  is  not  limited  to  the  exploration  of
the Moon, but speaks of missions beyond the Moon, beginning with Mars, for which
the  up-mass  limitations  are  critical.  Even  if  such  post-lunar  expeditions  are  far  in
the  future,  NASA  should  be  preparing  now  by  exploring  the  best-available  tech-
nologies,  and  these  can  only  be  identified  through  a  robust  program  of  both  funda-
mental  and  applied  research.  Lunar  expeditions  are  to  explore  the  possibilities  of
living  on  the  lunar  surface,  implying  the  conduct  of  research  to  investigate  issues
such  as  in  situ  resource  utilization.  Just  as  mass-efficient  spacecraft  systems  for
Martian  missions  increase  the  amount  of  water  and  food  that  can  be  carried  on-
board,  so  would  mass-efficient  systems  developed  for  lunar  missions  increase  the
amount  of  research  instrumentation  able  to  be  transported,  per  flight,  to  the  lunar
surface.

NASA  has  available  a  total  of  20  International  Standard  Payload  Racks  (ISPRs)
for  research  purposes;  10  in  the  U.S.  lab  and  five  each  in  the  JEM  and  Columbus
facilities.  Its  intention  is  to  utilize  half  of  these  ISPRs  for  exploration-related  re-
search  and  development,  but  it  is  difficult  to  envision  that  the  limited  number  of
investigations  described  will  be  sufficient  to  fully  utilize  these  resources.  As  men-
tioned  in  my  introductory  remarks,  the  fact  that  we  are  several  years  away  from
the  required  selection  of  some  enabling  technologies  suggests  that  a  vigorous  re-
search program be sustained in order to seek optimal solutions.
3. Does  NASA  have  appropriate  plans,  programs  and  resource  allocations
to  ensure  that  there  will  be  a  research  community  in  place  and  ade-
quately prepared to effectively utilize the ISS once the ISS is assembled?
No.  NASA  has  made  the  decision  to  get  out  of  the  non-exploration  research  busi-
ness  and  to  dramatically  restrict  investigations  related  to  exploration.  The  external
research community that existed just a few years ago is no longer in place and there
are  no  pending  NASA  Research  Announcements,  so  the  prospects  for  at  least  the
near future look dim. As also mentioned, this research community has moved on to
other pursuits and is engaged in and committed to research that cannot be dropped
to return to NASA-related work, even if the community were tempted to do so.

NASA  is  encouraging  the  use  of  the  ISS  by  other  federal  agencies  with  interests
in  microgravity  experimentation,  however,  those  agencies  are  expected  to  cover  the
full  cost  of  taking  their  ideas  to  flight,  including  the  very  expensive  transportation
portion.  I  understand  that  there  has  been  some  recent  interest  on  the  part  of  the
NIH  in  partnering  in  this  fashion,  but  find  it  difficult  to  believe  that,  given  budget
constraints, a significant amount of research from NIH or other federal agencies will
materialize in the near future to enable the full utilization of the 10 ISPRs that will
be available for non-exploration use aboard the ISS.
4. What  microgravity  research  in  the  physical  and  life  sciences  is  needed
to enable future human lunar and Mars exploration missions? Are there

35

any advantages to or requirements for conducting such research on the
ISS as opposed to a lunar outpost, on lunar sorties, or on free-flying plat-
forms?
As  described  above,  long-duration  manned  space  flight  will  require  the  develop-
ment  of  mass-efficient,  dual-use  hardware  to  accomplish  tasks  that  are  now  per-
formed  in,  perhaps,  less-than-optimal  ways.  The  ISS  is  the  only  platform  that  pro-
vides  access  to  long-term  weightlessness.  The  challenges  in  designing  for  the  3/8  g
environment  of  Mars  or  the  1/6  g  environment  of  the  Moon  are  routine;  for  zero-
g,  however,  the  absence  of  buoyancy  (the  force  that  causes  hot  fluids  to  rise  on
Earth)  provides  an  environment  in  which  other  forces,  typically  ‘‘masked’’  on  Earth
by  buoyancy,  are  dominant  and  exploitable.  Lunar  outposts  will  be  suitable  test
beds  for  some,  but  not  all,  technologies  designed  to  work  on  the  Martian  surface.
For  example,  the  Moon  has  no  atmosphere  while  Mars  does.  Therefore,  heat-rejec-
tion  needs  in  non-habitat  situations  on  the  lunar  surface  must  rely  on  the  heat-
transfer  mechanisms  of  radiation  and  conduction,  while  convection  that  transports
heat  due  to  fluid  motion  can  play  a  role  on  the  Martian  surface.  Lunar  sorties,  al-
though  of  reasonably  short  duration,  will  provide  some  microgravity  periods  for  ex-
perimentation,  if  crew  time  permits,  but  not  to  the  extent  that  can  be  performed
with a dedicated crew aboard the ISS.

In  the  life  sciences,  long-duration  space  flight  poses  well-known  problems  for  as-
tronauts,  bone  loss  being  a  major  one  for  which  no  existing  countermeasures  have
been  effective.  Another  major  hazard,  particularly  for  human  exploration  of  Mars,
is the exposure to radiation; the recent NRC report rules out radiation shielding as
being  up-mass  prohibitive  and  cautions  that  the  exposure  experienced  during  a
three-year Mars outpost mission, ‘‘has the potential to produce significant long-term
effects  that  may  not  be  limited  to  cancer  induction.’’  The  NRC  panel  recommends
searching  for  pharmacological  interventions  to  deal  with  these  effects.  Studies  on
the  effects  of  microgravity  and  space  environments  on  the  entire  range  of  scales
within  the  human  organism,  from  whole-body  to  cellular  levels,  seem  warranted.
The  psychological  problems  of  coping  with  the  isolation  experienced  during  a  500
day Mars mission are also of concern. Finally, long-duration space flight also means
that astronauts will likely be growing some of their own food, meaning further study
of plant cultivation in microgravity is likely necessary for exploration purposes.

The  use  of  free-flyers  is  definitely  a  way  to  get  some  research  requiring  a  quies-
cent  microgravity  environment  conducted.  Such  experiments  need  to  have  excellent
telescience  support  in  order  to  both  control  and  retrieve  data  from  the  experiment.
Those  experiments  that  need  human  intervention,  for  example,  to  change  samples,
are  not  candidates  for  free-flyers.  In  addition,  in  the  event  of  an  unforeseen  occur-
rence requiring repairs, the free-flyer experiment is typically over. Although careful
thought  and  preparation  goes  into  the  design  of  every  flight  experiment,  things
often happen that cannot be anticipated.
5. What are your perspectives on the intended and potential use of the ISS
as a national laboratory? What is necessary to enable ISS to be an effec-
tive laboratory?
As a member of two task groups that studied the management of research utiliza-
tion  aboard  the  ISS,  I  am  generally  supportive  of  the  concept  of  operating  the  U.S.
research  facilities  on  board  the  ISS  as  a  national  laboratory.  A  principal  benefit  is
the buy-in that is likely to come from the external research community to a labora-
tory managed by a consortium of their peers. This has certainly been the case with
the  Space  Telescope  Science  Institute,  although  it  is  recognized  that  the  degree  of
complexity of research management aboard the ISS is much larger.

What  is  disconcerting  about  NASA’s  plans  for  the  national  laboratory  concept,
however,  is  that  there  is  virtually  no  funding  associated  with  it,  either  to  support
in-house or external research or to provide for transportation of experiments to and
from  the  ISS.  Operationally,  the  national  laboratory  would  serve  a  role  not  unlike
that  of  existing  NASA  Centers,  from  the  standpoint  of  integrating  research  experi-
ments into the ISS, but very unlike a NASA Center, in that national-laboratory per-
sonnel would not have any discretionary funding to pursue research aboard the ISS
without  competing  for  funds  from  other  agencies  willing  to  perform  research  there.
The types of individuals the research community would like to have assisting them
with  the  development  of  their  flight  experiments  are  other  researchers  who  are
knowledgeable  about  the  logistical  and  scientific  issues  associated  with  their  work.
Attracting  such  individuals  to  a  national  laboratory  with  no  provision  for  even
small-scale investigations of their own will be a difficult task. In addition to the na-
tional-laboratory  funding  needed  for  direct  PI  support  and  a  modest  amount  of  in-
house  research,  there  is  a  substantial  amount  required  for  the  development,  quali-

fication and integration of experiment-specific hardware for the ISS. These functions
are currently supported, to a large degree, by the NASA Centers (which, by the way,
typically have discretionary funding to support in-house research). A mechanism for
seamless collaboration between the Centers and the national lab or for the transfer
of responsibilities (and funding to support them) to the national lab must be worked
out.

NASA is supporting the development of Commercial Orbital Transportation Serv-
ices  (COTS)  that  it  hopes  will  provide  transport  of  experimental  equipment  to  the
ISS  following  assembly-complete.  To  be  sure,  transportation  to  and  from  the  ISS  is
the  ‘‘rate-limiting’’  factor  controlling  its  efficient  utilization.  There  are  a  variety  of
payload  types  used  for  research  purposes,  the  broad  classifications  for  transpor-
tation purposes being pressurized and non-pressurized, with the former obviously a
requirement  for  living  systems  such  as  plant  and  animal  models.  Certain  types  of
research  payloads,  e.g.,  living  systems,  also  require  timely  transport  of  payloads
both  to  and  from  the  ISS  for  the  proper  conduct  of  the  experiments  and  analysis
of  results.  It  is  a  leap  of  faith  to  assume  that  a  sufficient  number  of  such  systems
will  be  ready  to  perform  all  the  necessary  functions  with  the  required  frequency  at
assembly-complete.  The  failure  of  COTS  solutions  would  leave  the  CEV  as  the
NASA  backup,  requiring  the  additional  purchase  of  transportation  services  from
Russia, and perhaps from other nations that are talking of developing such systems.
In summary, it is my belief that NASA is ill-prepared to fully utilize the research
facilities  of  the  ISS  upon  assembly-complete  in  2010.  Faced  with  the  loss  of  launch
capability  and  a  new  exploration  mission  to  be  funded  within  its  existing  budget,
NASA  has  chosen  to  virtually  eliminate  its  dynamic  extramural  research  program
in the life and physical sciences. This move is short-sighted and has caused the loss
of a research community devoted to NASA-related issues that will be difficult to re-
constitute.  Without  the  existence  of  this  community,  there  is  little  to  support  the
utilization of the ISS. The successful implementation of the Vision for Space Explo-
ration  will  require  the  presence  of  an  active,  diverse  research  program  performing
investigations at the cutting edge to define the technologies necessary for successful
exploration  while,  in  addition,  gaining  deeper  understanding  of  fundamental  sci-
entific  issues  that  can  serve  to  benefit  life  on  Earth.  NASA  has  always  been  re-
garded as a research agency. In this rapidly changing technological world, the need
for it to remain a research agency is more compelling than ever.

Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for inviting me to speak with the Subcommittee.
I  am  happy  to  answer  any  questions  about  these  issues  that  you  may  have  of  me.

BIOGRAPHY FOR G. PAUL NEITZEL

G. PAUL NEITZEL is a Professor of Fluid Mechanics in the George W. Woodruff
School  of  Mechanical  Engineering  at  the  Georgia  Institute  of  Technology,  where  he
has  been  on  the  faculty  since  1990.  Prior  to  that  he  spent  eleven  years  on  the  fac-
ulty  of  Arizona  State  University  and  ten  years  at  the  U.S.  Army  Ballistic  Research
Laboratory (now Army Research Laboratory) at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, dur-
ing  which  time  he  received  his  Ph.D.  in  fluid  mechanics  from  The  Johns  Hopkins
University.  Dr.  Neitzel’s  current  research  in  the  field  of  fluid  mechanics  encom-
passes  permanent  non-coalescence  and  non-wetting  of  droplets,  optical  droplet  levi-
tation  and  migration,  multi-phase  flow  simulation,  and  the  fluid  dynamics  of  bio-
reactors  used  for  mammalian  cell  culture.  Dr.  Neitzel  has  been  a  member  of  the
NASA  Space  Station  Utilization  Advisory  Subcommittee,  the  On-Orbit  Evaluation
Board,  the  Physical  Sciences  Advisory  Subcommittee  of  the  former  NASA  Office  of
Biological and Physical Research (OBPR), and chaired, for six years, the Fluid Phys-

STATEMENT  OF  MS.  CRISTINA  T.  CHAPLAIN,  DIRECTOR,  AC-
QUISITION  AND  SOURCING  MANAGEMENT,  GOVERNMENT
ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
Ms. CHAPLAIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Minority
Member  Feeney.  Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  discuss  challenges
faced  by  NASA  in  completing  and  sustaining  the  International
Space Station and retiring the Space Shuttle.

As  you  know,  these  endeavors  are  part  of  the  broader  Vision  for
Space  Exploration  which  require  careful  management  of  invest-
ments,  facilities,  workforce,  international  partners,  and  suppliers.
Clearly,  any  delays  or  problems  in  completing  and  sustaining  the
Space Station itself may well have reverberating affects on NASA’s
ability to ramp up exploration efforts or to support other important
missions.

Today I would like to present preliminary results of our work re-
lated  to  the  Station  and  the  Shuttle.  While  they  are  preliminary,
many  have  been  echoed  in  other  studies  and  identified  by  NASA
itself.

First,  there  are  significant  challenges  related  to  NASA’s  ability
to execute its plans to use the Shuttle to complete the Station. The
January, 2007, Shuttle manifest projects that NASA will launch 16
flights  before  retirement  of  the  Shuttle  fleet  in  September,  2010.
One of these has already been launched. Of the 15 remaining mis-
sions  one  is  reserved  for  the  Hubble  telescope,  and  two  are  des-
ignated  as  contingency  missions  that  are  slated  to  bring  materials
critical to Station sustainment.

On  average  when  counting  the  contingency  flights,  NASA  will
need to launch one Shuttle every 2.7 months, an aggressive sched-
ule  when  compared  to  recent  launch  timeframes.  Due  to  vehicle
traffic  constraints,  the  minimum  time  required  between  Shuttle
launches  to  the  Station  is  35  calendar  days.  So  while  the  manifest
is aggressive, it is achievable.

There  is,  however,  little  room  for  unexpected  delays  caused  by
weather damage or launch debris, which have proven to impact the
Shuttle launch schedule significantly.

In  addition,  there  are  potential  tradeoffs  NASA  can  make  in
order  to  position  what  is  needed  to  sustain  the  Station  after  the
Shuttle’s retirement, and some of these tradeoffs have already been
made. However, the potential deletion of such items as Node 3 and
the  Cupola  would  have  a  substantial  impact  on  the  quality  of  life
on  the  Station,  the  ability  to  conduct  research,  and  in  the  case  of
the  Cupola,  the  ability  to  use  a  robotic  arm  to  assist  in  docking
newer transportation vehicles.

Second,  we  have  previously  reported  that  there  is  significant
challenges  in  insuring  NASA  can  retain  critical  skills  to  manage
the  Shuttle  program  through  its  completion.  NASA  has  made
progress  in  implementing  previous  GAO  recommendations  on  this
issue.  For  example,  it  has  developed  an  agency-wide  strategic
human  capital  plan,  developed  workforce  analysis  tools,  and  is
mapping  available  skills  of  the  Shuttle  workforce  with  the  skills  it
will  need  in  the  future.  It  is  important  that  these  actions  be  sus-
tained throughout the transition and that NASA also measures its
progress,  identify  gaps  or  obstacles  that  need  to  be  addressed,  and
sustain a high degree of coordination with its centers.

There  are  considerable  challenges  with  filling  the  gap  between
the  Shuttle  and  the  new  NASA-developed  vehicles  to  service  the
Station. For example, NASA expects that the commercial sector can
develop transport vehicles that can take equipment and ultimately
crew  to  and  from  the  Station  during  the  gap.  However,  our  work
has generally found that space development efforts often encounter
schedule delays and technical problems, particularly when they are
seeking  to  obtain  significant  advances  in  technologies,  move  for-
ward  amid  unknowns,  or  manage  without  adequate  oversight  and
insight.

Risks may be high in these partnerships given that the suppliers
do  not  have  longstanding  relationships  with  NASA  and  the  devel-
opment  of  the  vehicles  represents  totally  new  endeavors  for  them.
Therefore,  it  is  critical  that  NASA  establish  clear  and  consistent
guidance,  limit  requirements  changes,  and  insure  it  has  visibility
into the progress being made by the commercial suppliers.

NASA’s  options  in  addition  to  the  commercial  vehicles  which  in-
clude both the European and the Japanese vehicles, which are new,
and  the  Legacy  Russian  vehicles,  however,  NASA’s  reliance  on
these  vehicles  to  augment  re-supply  activities  after  2010,  assumes
no  further  delay  in  development.  Moreover,  there  are  limits  to
what the payloads these vehicles can carry.

The  Independent  Safety  Task  Force  also  reported  challenges  in-
volved  with  working  through  laws  and  regulations  governing  the
transfer  of  technical  knowledge,  though  the  Station  program  office
reported to us that immediate hurdles had been overcome with re-
spect to the European vehicle.

In  addition,  continued  use  of  the  Russian  vehicles  will  require
the  U.S.  to  renegotiate  exemptions  to  the  Iran,  North  Korea,  and
Syria  Nonproliferation  Act.  Our  review  will  further  examine  risk
mitigation  efforts  related  to  the  gap  between  the  Shuttle  and

NASA-developed vehicles as well as the Shuttle manifest and work-
force issues.

We  look  forward  to  continuing  to  share  the  results  of  that  work

with this subcommittee.

Thank you. This concludes my statement, and I am happy to an-

swer any questions you have.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Chaplain follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CRISTINA T. CHAPLAIN

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:

I am pleased to be here today to discuss the challenges faced by the National Aer-
onautics and Space Administration (NASA) on the International Space Station (ISS)
and the Space Shuttle. NASA is in the midst of one of the most challenging periods
in  its  history.  As  part  of  its  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  NASA  is  simultaneously
developing  a  range  of  new  technologies  and  highly  complex  systems  to  support  fu-
ture  exploration  efforts,  completing  assembly  of  the  Space  Station,  and  retiring  the
Space Shuttle. This is NASA’s biggest transition effort since landing humans on the
Moon  more  than  three  decades  ago  and  then  initiating  the  Space  Shuttle  Program
a  few  years  later.  Taken  together,  these  efforts  create  significant  challenges  in
terms of managing investments, launch and other facilities, workforce, international
partners,  and  suppliers.  Clearly,  any  delays  or  problems  in  completing  and  sus-
taining the Space Station itself, may well have reverberating effects on NASA’s abil-
ity  to  ramp  up  efforts  to  develop  technologies  needed  for  future  exploration  or  to
support other important missions.

GAO has undertaken a body of work related to NASA’s transition efforts that in-
clude NASA’s industrial supplier base, its workforce challenges, development of new
crew and cargo spacecraft, and NASA’s assembly and sustainment activities related
to  the  ISS.  My  statement  today  focuses  on  the  preliminary  results  of  on-going  ef-
forts,  as  well  as  other  GAO  work  completed  to  date.  Specifically,  I  will  address  the
following challenges: (1) executing plans to use the Shuttle to complete the ISS; (2)
maintenance of the Shuttle workforce through retirement of the Shuttle; and (3) fill-
ing  the  gap  between  the  Shuttle  and  new  NASA-developed  vehicles  to  service  the
ISS.  NASA’s  ability  to  overcome  these  challenges  will  be  critical  to  ensuring  the
availability  of  the  International  Space  Station  as  a  viable  research  entity  into  the
future.  While  these  results  and  findings  are  preliminary,  many  have  been  echoed
in  other  studies  and  identified  by  NASA  itself.  Our  work  is  being  conducted  in  ac-
cordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
Background

NASA  plans  to  finish  assembling  the  ISS  in  2010  and  operate  the  Station  until
2016.  The  Station  is  scheduled  to  support  six-person  crew  capability  as  early  as
2009. The Shuttle was to be the primary means for ISS re-supply and crew rotation.
NASA’s  international  partners  were  planning  to  augment  the  Shuttle’s  capabilities
with  their  cargo  and  crew  spacecraft.  Following  the  Columbia  disaster  in  2003,  the
President  set  a  new  ‘‘vision’’  for  NASA  that  called  for  the  Shuttle’s  retirement  in
2010 upon completing ISS assembly. As part of the Vision, NASA is developing new
crew and cargo vehicles, currently scheduled to be available in the 2015 timeframe.
One  of  the  vehicles—the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle—will  carry  and  support  only
crews  traveling  to  low-Earth  orbit  and  beyond  and  will  also  be  capable  of  ferrying
astronauts to and from the ISS. However, since these systems are not scheduled to
become  operational  until  2015,  NASA  plans  to  rely  on  international  partners  and
commercial providers to make up the five-year gap in ISS logistics and crew rotation
resulting from the Shuttle retirement.
Aggressive Launch Schedule for Space Shuttle

As  we  have  begun  our  review  of  ISS  assembly,  several  issues  related  to  NASA’s
Space  Shuttle  manifest  have  come  to  our  attention.  First,  the  Shuttle  manifest
dated  January  2007  projects  that  NASA  will  launch  16  missions  before  retirement
of the Shuttle in 2010—one of those has already been launched. Of the 15 remaining
missions,  one  will  service  the  Hubble  Telescope  and  two  are  designated  as  contin-
gency  missions.  Assuming  the  contingency  flights  are  included,  on  average,  NASA
will  need  to  launch  one  Shuttle  every  2.7  months—an  aggressive  schedule  when
compared  to  recent  launch  timeframes.  In  the  past,  with  three  Shuttles,  NASA
launched  a  Shuttle  every  3.7  months  on  average  after  the  Challenger  accident  in
1986.  Since  the  Columbia  accident  in  2003,  NASA  has  averaged  10.8  months  be-

tween  launches.1 For  the  remainder  of  calendar  year  2007,  NASA  has  three
launches planned, which will total four missions for the year. Due to vehicle traffic
constraints, the minimum required time between Shuttle launches to ISS is 35 cal-
endar days, so while the manifest is aggressive, it is achievable.

Additionally, the current Shuttle manifest leaves little room for unexpected delays
caused by weather damage or launch debris, which have proven to impact the Shut-
tle launch schedule significantly. For example, in 2007, hail damage to the external
fuel  tank  caused  an  unexpected  two  month  delay  in  a  Shuttle  launch.  While  there
are  limits  to  the  planning  NASA  can  do  for  such  events,  the  tight  schedule  con-
straints leave little room for significant delays as a result of such occurrences.

As  evidence  of  the  increasing  pressure  NASA  is  experiencing  with  regard  to  the
Shuttle  manifest,  the  ISS  program  office  is  planning  for  certain  cargo  elements  to
be launched on the two final Shuttle flights even thought NASA, as an agency, still
considers  these  flights  contingency  missions.  NASA  is  also  being  forced  to  consider
the  possibility  of  canceling  delivery  of  some  portions  of  the  ISS.  Specifically,  NASA
determined  that  if  the  schedule  slips,  the  Cupola  observatory  and  the  Node  3  con-
nector  built  for  hardware,  oxygen  and  waste  storage  may  be  slipped  to  contingency
flights.  If  that  occurs  and  those  flights  do  not  launch,  those  elements  may  not  be
assembled on ISS as originally planned.

Finally,  NASA  officials  explained  that  since  only  the  Shuttle  is  large  enough  to
deliver  certain  large  Orbital  Replacement  Units  (ORUs)  to  the  ISS,  they  must  be
launched prior to retirement of the Shuttle. These ORUs are replacement segments
for those segments operating on the ISS that fail or reach the end of their life. The
officials  noted  that  NASA  originally  planned  to  use  the  Shuttle  to  launch  and  re-
trieve  certain  large  ORUs  that  are  critical  for  ISS  operations.  After  being  brought
back  to  Earth,  the  plan  was  to  repair  and  refurbish  the  ORUs  and  return  them  to
service on the ISS. However, with the Shuttle no longer available to transport those
ORUs  after  2010,  NASA  changed  its  strategy  for  providing  them  to  ISS  from  a  re-
furbishment approach to a ‘‘launch and burn’’ approach. They suggested that under
the new strategy, NASA would build enough ORUs to cover the ISS planned mission
life  and  use  them  up  over  time.  Large  ORUs  that  originally  were  to  be  launched
and  returned  on  the  Shuttle  would  have  to  be  pre-positioned  on  the  ISS  before  the
Shuttle retires.

There  is  still  much  to  be  worked  out  with  NASA’s  change  in  strategy  for  posi-
tioning  ORUs  to  cover  the  Space  Station’s  planned  mission  life.  For  example,  the
program  office  is  still  assessing  the  implications  of  restarting  production  lines  to
produce  additional  spares.  This  involves  examining  whether  the  right  equipment,
materials,  expertise,  and  data  is  still  available—an  endeavor  that  the  ISS  program
office  acknowledged  would  be  challenging.  We  will  continue  to  monitor  changes  to
the Shuttle manifest as they occur.
Shuttle Workforce Challenges

The  Space  Shuttle  workforce  currently  consists  of  approximately  2,000  civil  serv-
ice  and  15,000  contractor  personnel.  NASA  must  maintain  a  workforce  with  nec-
essary  critical  skills  to  manage  the  Shuttle  program  through  its  completion.  In  re-
sponse  to  GAO  recommendations,  NASA  has  undertaken  several  initiatives  to  at-
tempt to address its potential workforce drain.

In  2005,  we  reported  that  NASA  had  made  limited  progress  toward  developing  a
detailed  strategy  for  sustaining  a  critically  skilled  Shuttle  workforce  to  support
Space  Shuttle  operations.  We  reported  that  significant  delays  in  implementing  a
strategy to sustain the Shuttle workforce would likely lead to larger problems, such
as funding and failure to meet NASA program schedules. Accordingly, we concluded
that timely action to address workforce issues is critical given their potential impact
on NASA-wide goals such as closing the gap in human space flight. At the time we
performed  our  work  several  factors  hampered  the  ability  of  the  Space  Shuttle  Pro-
gram  to  develop  a  detailed  long-term  strategy  for  sustaining  the  critically  skilled
workforce  necessary  to  support  safe  Space  Shuttle  operations  through  retirement.
For  example,  the  program’s  focus  was  on  returning  the  Shuttle  to  flight,  and  other
efforts such as determining workforce requirements were delayed. In our report, we
recommended  that  NASA  begin  identifying  the  Space  Shuttle  Program’s  future
workforce needs based upon various future scenarios. Scenario planning could better
enable  NASA  to  develop  strategies  for  meeting  future  needs.  NASA  concurred  with
our recommendation. The agency acknowledged that Shuttle workforce management
and critical skills retention will be a major challenge as it progresses toward retire-
ment of the Space Shuttle and as such has acted to respond to our recommendation.

1 These  values  represent  the  time  between  the  launch  date  of  the  flight  that  resulted  in  loss

of the Shuttle and the launch date of the next subsequent flight.

42

For  example,  since  we  made  our  recommendation,  NASA  developed  an  agency
wide  strategic  human  capital  plan  and  developed  workforce  analysis  tools  to  assist
it  in  identifying  critical  skills  needs.  NASA  also  developed  a  human  capital  plan
specifically  for  sustaining  the  Shuttle  workforce  through  the  retirement  and,  then
transitioning  the  workforce.  According  to  agency  officials,  currently  NASA  is  map-
ping  the  available  skills  of  the  Space  Shuttle  workforce  with  the  skills  it  will  need
for  future  work  so  that  it  can  better  plan  and  implement  workforce  reassignments.
NASA’s senior leaders recognize the need for an effective workforce strategy in order
to successfully complete ISS before retirement of the Shuttle. Clear, strong executive
leadership  will  be  needed  to  ensure  that  the  risks  associated  with  the  transition  of
the Shuttle workforce are minimized.
Filling the Gap Between the Shuttle and New NASA–Developed Vehicles to

Service the International Space Station

NASA  has  several  options  for  filling  the  gap  between  the  Shuttle,  which  will  re-
tire  in  2010  and  new  NASA-developed  vehicles  that  are  not  expected  to  come  on-
line  until  2015.  The  first  relies  on  new  vehicles  developed  within  the  U.S.  commer-
cial  space  sector.  The  second  relies  on  vehicles  developed  by  international  part-
ners—both  new  and  legacy  systems.  There  are  considerable  challenges  with  all  op-
tions NASA is examining.
NASA Dependence on Commercial Development

NASA is working with the commercial space sector to develop and produce trans-
port  vehicles  that  can  take  equipment  and  ultimately  crew  to  and  from  the  Space
Station  during  the  gap  between  the  Space  Shuttle  and  the  crew  launch  vehicle.
Rather  than  buy  these  vehicles  outright,  NASA  plans  to  help  fund  their  develop-
ment and purchase transportation services or perhaps even the vehicles themselves
when  they  are  needed.  This  program  is  known  as  Commercial  Orbital  Transpor-
tation  Services  (COTS).  Currently,  NASA  has  seven  COTS  agreements—all  are  in
the  initial  phases  of  raising  private  funds  for  the  development.  NASA  funding  has
been  provided  to  two  companies,  Rocketplane  Kistler  (RpK)  and  Space  Exploration
Technologies (SpaceX). NASA has signed five more Space Act Agreements which fa-
cilitates sharing technological information, but these agreements are unfunded.

There  are  two  phases  to  the  program,  the  first  phase  entails  COTS  technical  de-
velopment and demonstration and the second phase will be the competitive procure-
ment  of  orbital  transportation  services  for  ISS  logistical  support.  NASA  officials
noted that both RpK and SpaceX met their first milestone to demonstrate financial
progress  by  obtaining  private  funding.  However,  RpK  missed  its  second  milestone
in  May  31,  2007  and  had  to  renegotiate  its  Space  Act  Agreement  milestone  with
NASA.

The International Space Station Independent Safety Task Force (IISTF)2 reported
in  February  2007  that  the  design,  development,  and  certification  of  the  new  Com-
mercial Orbital Transportation System (COTS) capability for ISS re-supply was just
beginning.  IISTF  stated  that,  ‘‘if  similar  to  other  new  program  development  activi-
ties, it most likely will take much longer than expected and will cost more than an-
ticipated.’’  Our  work  has  generally  found  space  and  other  complex  system  develop-
ment  efforts—including  NASA-sponsored  efforts—often  encounter  schedule  delays
and  technical  problems  when  they  are  seeking  to  obtain  significant  advances  in
technologies,  move  forward  amid  changing  requirements  or  with  other  unknowns,
and/or  are  managed  without  adequate  oversight,  In  our  opinion,  risks  may  be  high
in  these  partnerships,  given  that  the  suppliers  do  not  have  long-standing  relation-
ships  with  NASA  or  other  government  agencies  and  the  development  of  the  COTS
vehicles  represent  totally  new  endeavors  for  most  of  these  companies.  As  such,  it
will  be  exceedingly  important  for  NASA  to  establish  sound  program  management
and oversight controls over these endeavors, establish clear and consistent guidance,
limit  requirements  changes,  and  ensure  it  has  adequate  visibility  into  the  progress
being  made  by  the  COTS  suppliers.  Our  review  will  examine  the  extent  to  which
these measures are being taken. As you know, GAO has identified contract manage-
ment  as  a  high  risk  area  for  NASA.  Actions  designed  to  enhance  program  manage-
ment and oversight are being implemented, but it may take years to complete them.
This may make it even more difficult for NASA to successfully manage and oversee
its  relationship  with  the  COTS  suppliers.  If  NASA  relies  on  these  development  ef-
forts without adequate oversight, the programs could fall short of cost and schedule

Task  Force  was  charged  with  assessing  the  vulnerabilities  of  the  International  Space  Station.

estimates,  result  in  downgraded  performance,  and  ultimately  impact  overall
sustainment of the ISS.
NASA Dependence on International Partners

NASA has suggested that some supply activities during the gap can be conducted
by vehicles under development or currently in operation by international partners—
specifically, Europe, Japan and Russia—but these vehicles have constraints. Our on-
going review will assess these constraints in greater detail.

To begin with, new vehicles being developed by the European and Japanese space
agencies  are  very  complex.  Currently,  the  first  test  flight  for  the  European  vehicle
is  likely  to  happen  in  January  2008.  The  Japanese  vehicle  will  not  have  its  first
operational  flight  until  2009.  According  to  NASA  officials,  both  the  European  and
Japanese  vehicle  developments  experienced  technical  hurdles  and  budgetary  con-
straints, but both partners are committed to fulfilling their roles as partners in the
ISS  program.  They  do  have  confidence  that  the  European  vehicle  will  be  available
for  ISS  operations  before  retirement  of  the  Shuttle,  but  they  are  not  as  confident
about the Japanese vehicle being ready by that time. NASA reliance on these vehi-
cles to augment re-supply activities after 2010 assumes that further delays in their
development will not occur. NASA’s expectation is that these vehicles will be devel-
oped  in  parallel  with  commercial  developments.  The  agency’s  preference  is  to  use
commercially  developed  vehicles,  rather  than  rely  on  the  vehicles  developed  by  the
international  partners  to  cover  the  capability  gap  after  retirement  of  the  Shuttle
fleet.

NASA also plans to continue working with Russia to provide crew and cargo sup-
port  to  the  ISS,  but  this  has  been  facilitated  through  an  exemption  to  the  Iran,
North  Korea  and  Syria  Nonproliferation  Act.  Russian  vehicles  that  were  already
operational were used to rotate crew and supply ISS during the period after the Co-
lumbia  accident  and  a  Russian  Soyuz  vehicle  remains  docked  to  the  ISS  continu-
ously.  The  Iran,  North  Korea  and  Syria  Nonproliferation  Act  exemption  expires  at
the  end  of  2011,  at  which  time  any  exchanges  will  be  subject  to  the  restrictions  of
the  Act.  However,  if  commercial  development  does  not  produce  a  usable  vehicle  by
that  date,  the  only  vehicle  that  can  support  crew  transportation  is  the  Russian
Soyuz  spacecraft.  According  to  NASA  officials,  the  agency  is  planning  to  request  a
waiver to gain further exemption beyond 2011 if this situation occurs.

Additionally, there are challenges related to sharing knowledge with international
partners due to restrictions by the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR).
This  was  highlighted  by  the  International  Space  Station  Independent  Safety  Task
Force,  and  NASA  has  been  working  to  address  the  concerns  laid  out  in  that  study.
Over  the  years,  GAO  has  identified  weaknesses  in  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness
of  government  programs  designed  to  protect  critical  technologies  while  advancing
U.S.  interests.  While  each  program  has  its  own  set  of  challenges,  we  found  that
these weaknesses are largely attributable to poor coordination within complex inter-
agency processes, inefficiencies in program operations, and a lack of systematic eval-
uations for assessing program effectiveness and identifying corrective actions. How-
ever, in reviewing in the Joint Strike Fighter, another complex international system
development effort, we also identified actions that could be taken early in programs
to  prevent  delays  and  other  problems  related  to  ITAR.  Our  review  going  forward
will assess the degree to which challenges in this area remain.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  pleased  to  answer  any

questions that you or the other Members may have at this time.

DISCUSSION

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chaplain. Thanks again to the
entire  panel.  This  is  very,  very  helpful,  and  we  will  now  begin  the
first  round  of  questions,  and  the  Chair  will  recognize  himself  for
five minutes.

LOGISTICAL SUPPORT FOR ISS AND COTS

And I want to focus in on the issue of logistical support, and Mr.
Holloway, from your testimony you feel like this is the most serious
issue facing the program, that is this logistical support for the Sta-
tion  after  the  Shuttle  is  retired.  You  say,  for  example,  that  inad-
equate logistics will result in a serious decrease in the utility of the

Station  and  could  result  in  its  abandonment.  And  then  you  go  on
to  recommend  that  the  Administration,  Congress,  and  NASA
should  support  a  productive,  I  am  sorry,  proactive  emphasized
post-Shuttle  logistical  transportation  program,  including  adequate
funding  of  approximately  $1  billion  per  year  above  current  alloca-
tions  to  insure  that  adequate  logistics  and  spares  are  available  to
maintain a viable station.

You  recommend  as  well  that  NASA  not  commit  the  ISS  to  an
unproven  logistic  support  system  such  as  COTS.  However,  at
present  NASA  appears  to  be  counting  on  COTS  as  its  main  post-
Shuttle  logistics  system,  and  the  Administration’s  given  little  indi-
cation  that  it  is  considering  this  billion-dollar  increase  per  your
suggestions.

How  much  risk  is  being  added  to  the  ISS  Program  by  these  ac-
tions  in  your  opinion?  And  Mr.  Gerstenmaier,  I  will  give  you  a
chance to respond as well.

Mr. HOLLOWAY. Mr. Chairman, first of all, that is a very difficult
question  to  answer,  but  at  the  time  of  the  conclusion  of  the  report
there  was  120,000-pound  shortfall  in  logistics  capability  that  was
dependent  upon  some  future  transportation  system,  either  the
COTS  or  the  emerging  partner  capability  or  the  Russian  progress
vehicle.  That  is  a  tremendous  amount  of  logistics,  and  as  you  well
know, you need food, water, oxygen, and maintenance spares to be
able  to  operate  the  Station.  Without  that  you  eventually  will  have
to abandon the Station.

The  COTS  Program  I  am  sure  that  we  all  are  very  anxious  for
it  to  be  successful,  and  we  are  looking  forward  to  the  day  when
commercial  activities  can  routinely  launch  cargo  and  people  into
low-Earth orbit. That will be a great day for the space program.

But the building of a rocket, of course, is a difficult endeavor, but
with  the  proper  reliability  and  safety  aspects  but  also  building  a
vehicle  that  can  approach  and  be  attached  to  the  Space  Station  is
a  daunting,  technical  challenge  driven  by  the  appropriate  I  must
say safety requirements to, that are levied on that vehicle.

The  European  Space  Agency  has  been  working  on  that  for  the
ATV  for  approximately  10  years  and  have  worked  very  diligently,
and  I  must  add  at  least  for  the  last  six  or  eight  years  have  had
a  very  good  technical  team.  And  they  are  just  now  emerging  with
the opportunity to launch the first one next year.

So  in  the  long  haul,  I  would  think  it  would  be  unlikely  that  the
COTS will be able to provide a substantial part of the logistics pro-
gram  in  the  most  critical  period  following  the  retirement  of  the
Shuttle  program.  I  hope  I  am  wrong,  but  I  expect  that  it  will  be
several  years  after  that  before  routine  commercial  activities  are
viable.

So  I  think  depending  totally  upon  COTS  would  be  a  significant

risk to the long-term viability of the Station.

Chairman  UDALL.  Mr.  Gerstenmaier,  would  you  care  to  respond,

and you have 45 seconds to respond.

Actually, we will come back to you for your time.
Mr. GERSTENMAIER. Okay.
Chairman  UDALL.  The  Ranking  Member  has  offered  to  provide
you  the  additional  time  to  respond  in  the  length  that  you  need  to
respond, please.

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Well,  first  of  all,  we  agree  that  one  of  the
long-term challenges of the Space Station is logistical support. This
is  clearly  something  we  need  to  go  work  on.  Since  the  task  force
reviewed the program, we added in some minimal progress support
to  provide  some  logistics  capability  to  Space  Station,  and  what  we
did  there  is  we  added  just  the  absolute  minimum  essentially  to
keep  Space  Station  viable.  We  didn’t  add  any  additional  spares  or
any additional cargo in that contract addition, and we left room for
the  commercial  orbital  transportation  systems  to  come  on  line.  We
also have got agreements now for the Automated Transfer Vehicle,
the  European  vehicle,  and  also  the  Japanese  vehicle  to  provide
cargo to station.

So  we  have  an  understanding  of  the  basic  transportation  plan
that we need in the future. We have an approach that kind of goes
day  by  day  in  a  sense  and  allows  us  to  monitor  these  activities
such that we can anticipate a problem that is coming and still have
a chance to react to it before it becomes a major problem to us.

So the first step is we are using the Shuttle and the two logistics
flights  to  essentially  outfit  Space  Station  with  all  the  spares  that
we can before the Shuttle departs. So we anticipate with our basic
failure  rates  we  see  on  our  components  we  will  have  two  to  three
years  of  margin  after  the  Shuttle  retires  that  the  Station  will  be
viable  with  the  spares  that  we  have  pre-positioned.  So  in  other
words,  we  put  items  that  we  anticipate  may  fail  on-board  Station
ahead  of  time  so  they  are  there  in  their  pre-position.  So  that  buys
us some time.

We will also know next year how well the COTS Program is pro-
gressing.  We  will  get  a  chance  to  see,  they  have  a  demonstration
flight towards the end of the year and two other flights at the first
part of the year. That will give us critical information and will tell
us whether COTS is viable or it looks like it is going to be delayed
a little bit. That will be very important data for us.

We  will  also  get  to  see  the  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  fly  in
January.  That  will  provide  critical  data  to  us.  So  I  think  we  have
a logical and step-wise plan that we can protect for this logistic pe-
riod, this logistic support period when the Shuttle retires. We have
time  to  detect  a  problem  that  is  coming  to  us  before  we  have  to,
before  we  are  in  a  situation  where  we  cannot  react,  and  then  we
have some controls to react depending on what we see.

The  other  big  unknown  is  we  don’t  know  what  the  failure  rate
is  going  to  be  on  these  components.  We  have  only  recently  acti-
vated  the  truss  components.  That  is  the  hardware  that  sits  out  on
the truss. Some components are on the inside of the Space Station
and  perform  significantly  better  than  our  analysis  had  shown,  so
we  may  be  better  from  a  logistics  re-supply  plan  or  a  failure  rate
standpoint. Again, we will know next year.

So  I  think  next  year  we  will  be  in  a  much  better  posture  to  see
what  the  future  looks  like,  to  see  where  we  are,  and  we  still  have
time  to  react  with  the  plan.  We  are  working  this,  and  we  are  ag-
gressively looking forward to solve this problem.

Chairman  UDALL.  Mr.  Gerstenmaier,  thank  you,  and  I  look  for-

ward to returning to this topic in the next round.

And  at  this  time  it  is  my  pleasure  to  recognize  the  Ranking

Member, Mr. Feeney, for five minutes.

MICROMETEOROIDS AND ORBITAL DEBRIS PROTECTION FOR

ISS3

Mr. FEENEY. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, I want to get
back  to  COTS  at  some  point,  too,  but  first  I  want  to  address  an-
other issue that the task force brought up, Mr. Holloway, and that
is  referred  to  as  the  micrometeoroid  and  orbital  debris  problem,
and I want to make sure I understand your presentation right.

On  page  2  you  say  that  over  a  10-year  period  the  ISS  has  a  55
percent  chance  of  being  struck  by  either  debris  or  a  micromete-
oroid.  Is  that  right?  With  a  nine  percent  risk  of  a  catastrophic  re-
sult?

Mr. HOLLOWAY. That is correct.
Mr.  FEENEY.  With  implementation  of  changes  that  are  available
that  you  have  recommended,  that  that  risk  can  be  roughly  cut  in
half?

Mr. HOLLOWAY. That is also correct.
Mr.  FEENEY.  This  is  a  reminder  that  despite  the  great  successes
we have had, and by the way, the most recent one was the brilliant
work  that  the  people  at  NASA,  the  United  Space  Alliance,  and
many  other  contractors  did  working  in  a  seamless  team  to  get  us
through  the  hail  storm  issue  from  February  and  get  us  back  in  a
very timely manner. So it is remarkable, but this is a reminder as
you  testified  that  space  exploration  is  inherently  risky.  Does  any-
body on the panel have an opinion about the—well, let me ask the
question first this way.

Mr.  Gerstenmaier,  has  the  Space  Station  had  to  be  maneuvered
at  all  to  avoid  any  of  the  debris  from  the  Chinese  ASAT  Test,
where they basically blew up their own——

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  No,  we  did  not  maneuver  the  Station  for
that. The problem with some of that debris is it is so small it can’t
be tracked very effectively.

Mr. FEENEY. Right.
Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  So  then  you  don’t  know  how  to  maneuver.
The good thing about the Space Station was it was at a low enough
altitude  that  the  debris  cloud  from  that  satellite  destruction
transited  the  Station  orbit  very  quickly.  So  it  was  a  fairly  short-
term  threat  to  Space  Station.  Space  station  has  debris  panels  on
the outside to protect us from this small debris that was called out
in the report. Since the report we have added debris panels on the
Russian  service  module.  Those  were  done  in  an  EVA  this  summer
or  early  this  spring  by  the  Russians,  so  that  activity  is  complete.
We  have  also  got  some  debris  wings  which  will  shield  the  service
module.  We  have  had  discussions  with  the  Russians,  and  we  are
currently planning to put those on a Shuttle flight in the future to
go ahead and carry those up to Space Station.

So  we  have  implemented  one  near-term  protection.  We  have
plans for another one that is moving forward, and we are still look-
ing  at  the  recommendation  of  putting  additional  protection  on  the
Soyuz  and  progress  vehicles,  and  we  are  still  working  with  our
Russian partners on that.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  Chairman  Udall’s  home  state  they  do  a  re-
markable  job  at  the  space  wing  tracking  some  eight  or  10,000
pieces  of  so-called  space  junk  or  space  debris.  But  if  this  is  as  big

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:35 Jan 24, 2008 Jkt 036737 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\072407\36737 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

47

a  concern  as  the  task  force  recommends,  Mr.  Holloway,  one  of  the
things  we  need  to  do  is  to  convince  the  international  space-faring
nations,  starting  with  the  Chinese,  that  turning  one  obsolete  sat-
ellite into 800 or 8,000 pieces of space junk is a risk we don’t want,
as nations want to put human beings into space. So this should be,
and  there  are  lots  of  other  reasons  why  the  Chinese  should  not
have  done  what  they  did,  but  at  a  minimum  the  fact  that  if  the
Chinese  and  other  space-faring  nations  want  to  have  peaceful
human exploration of space, they have to respect the fact that they
just can’t put missiles out there to—and so if anybody cares to com-
ment  on  that,  that  is  fine.  Otherwise,  just  be  taken  as  a  speech.

LOGISTICAL SUPPORT FOR ISS AND COTS

Mr. Gerstenmaier, going back to COTS for a second, NASA right
now  acknowledges  a  $300  million  shortfall  in  the  ISS  crew/cargo
services budget based on current estimates as I understand it, with
an  additional  $600  million  shortfall  held  as  a  lien  against  the  ex-
ploration systems mission directorate budget.

We are all anxious and hopeful that COTS is going to be success-
ful.  You  talk  about  a  number  of  tests  the  next  12  months  or  so.
When  will  we  have  to  address  the  issue  that  the  task  force  has
raised about a potential billion dollar shortfall in servicing the Sta-
tion  post-Shuttle  if  COTS  and  our  other  international  partners
can’t achieve what they plan—when will this decision be timely?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. Again, as I described in my earlier remarks,
it  is  really  a  process.  We  will  gain  some  information  on  what  our
failure  rates  are  of  the  components  throughout  this  next  year.  We
will  also  get  a  chance  to  see  the  provider’s  viability  and  see  how
well  this  space  craft  will  perform,  which  will  be  important  to  us.
We will also get an idea of what the cost of that cargo and carrying
capability  is.  Through  this  next  budget  process  we  are  working  on
now  for  the  next  budget  cycle,  we  are  refining  some  of  those  esti-
mates,  taking  into  account  this  data,  so  probably  for  next  year’s
budget  activity  we  will  be  prepared  to  discuss  with  a  little  more
certainty  about  where  we  are  in  terms  of  budget  threats  and
things.

But,  again,  there  is  many  variables  here,  and  we  are  actively
analyzing  those  and  gaining  data  to  see  if  we  can  understand  bet-
ter what the real threats are and the options.

Mr. LAMPSON. [Presiding] Thank you, Mr. Feeney.
Mr.  Udall  had  to  step  out  of  the  room  and  asked  me  to  take  the
Chair for a few minutes, and seeing as how I was the next one up
for questioning, I will yield myself the next five minutes.

STATUS OF AMS

Mr.  Gerstenmaier,  let  me  start  with  you.  I  have  had  a  number
of  meetings  in  the  last  several  months  with  people  who  have  been
working  on  the  Alpha  Magnetic  Spectrometer,  AMS,  and  I  know
that this is something that has been taken off of the manifest from
what I understand, and I am at some point in time wanting to seek
ways that we will be able to hopefully get it put back on.

But  what  was  NASA’s  original  agreement  regarding  the  AMS?
Was  it—and  once  the,  well,  what  was  the  original  agreement?  Let

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:35 Jan 24, 2008 Jkt 036737 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\072407\36737 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

48

us start with that. I have a whole series of questions on this if you
don’t mind.

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  I  believe  the  original  agreement  was  to  fly
a precursor mission, which we did on STS–91, and that was to look
at the basic technology and the basic device. We also agreed to pro-
vide some integration activity to essentially help build up the cargo
and  interface  it  with  the  Shuttle  for  launch  vehicle.  We  are  still
continuing to do that, and we are still continuing to look at it.

And  originally  we  had  agreed  to  try  to  fly  to  Space  Station  in  a
long-duration  manner.  But  after  the  Columbia  tragedy  occurred,
we immediately informed the DOE that we could no longer live up
to that second commitment, and the reason there is just the discus-
sion  we  have  had  here  is  that  we  had  this  critical  logistic  sparing
needs  for  Space  Station  and  then  we  have  a  limited  number  of
Shuttle  flights.  So  we  really  have  no  option  other  than  we  cannot
fly  the  device  without  taking  some  critical  spares  off  that  could
jeopardize the overall health of Space Station.

So  as  soon  as  we  knew  that,  the  Administrator  informed  the
DOE and our partners we could not meet that second commitment.
Mr. LAMPSON. What is the response of the international partners

to NASA for canceling the plans?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Our  interface  is  primarily  with  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy,  and  I  have,  we  have  not  heard  anything,  I  don’t
think, directly from the Department of Energy.

Mr. LAMPSON. Might NASA be required to pay any penalties?
Mr. GERSTENMAIER. Again, I think it was, the way the agreement
was  written  was  it  was  written  as  a  best  effort,  and  we  lived  up
to the intent of what the best effort was.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  Do  you  think  that  it  might  jeopardize  future  col-
laborations  between  or  among  potential  partner  nations  on  other
projects?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Again,  I  think  our  partners  recognize  the
complexity of what we are trying to do when we had the Columbia
tragedy. You know, we are still launching their primary laboratory
modules,  we  are  still  meeting  our  international  commitments  to
them to do, to provide research facilities. Still providing substantial
support  to  all  our  international  partners  in  that  respect,  and  I
think  they  recognize  the  difficult  situation  that  we  were  placed  in,
and  they  recognize  the  rationale  for  the  decision  that  we  had  no
choice to make.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  Just  for  the  record,  I  have  met  with  some  of  the
representatives  of  those  international  partners,  I  think  five  of
them,  and  from  what  I  understand  this  project  was  one  that  was
to  cost  around  $1.2  billion,  and  the  international  partners  were
going to pay 95 percent of the cost of the project. They have essen-
tially completed the work that they were doing on it, and the larg-
est part of what we were going to do, I think, was to put it on the
International Space Station.

Those folks with whom I have spoken are not the happiest camp-
ers in the world right now. So there is some potential downside for
this not happening.

A  recent  Department  of  Energy  sponsored  external  review  of
AMS  supports  the  scientific  validity  of  the  AMS  experiment.
NASA’s response is that, ‘‘The review does not evaluate AMS in the

context  of  NASA’s  broader  program  of  astrophysics  research.
NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate  relies  on  broad  reviews  of
science  disciplines  conducted  by  the  National  Research  Council  of
the National Academies of Science to establish priorities among po-
tential  missions.’’  Because  the  DOE  review  took  place  outside  of
this framework, it is of limited useful to NASA.

Mr. Gerstenmaier, was the review conducted with the awareness
of its limited usefulness to NASA, and if so, what was its purpose?
Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  I  am  really  not  in  the  right  position  to  an-
swer  that.  I  think  that  would  be  a  better  question  directed  at  the
Science Mission Director.

Mr. LAMPSON. Okay.
Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  I  am  more  on  the  facilities  side  and  not  on

the scientific research.

Mr. LAMPSON. Fair enough. Thank you.
Would  any  of  the  other  witnesses  care  to  comment  on  any  of

the—Dr. Neitzel, please.

Dr. NEITZEL. I would be happy to comment, because I think that
this  occurrence  speaks  directly  to  what  NASA  says  it  wants  to  do
with  respect  to  the  implementation  of  the  National  Research  Lab-
oratory  aboard  the  ISS.  NASA  claims  it  wants  to  go  out  and  find
other  federal  agencies  willing  to  perform  research  aboard  the  ISS
and  to  utilize  this  unique  facility.  And  here  is  a  perfect  example
of the Department of Energy stepping up to the plate and doing ex-
actly that with the participation of all these international partners,
and now NASA says it is going to remove this experiment from the
Shuttle manifest.

So that doesn’t provide a lot of confidence that this model of hav-
ing  other  federal  agencies  do  research  aboard  the  ISS  is  perhaps
a viable one.

Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  And  my  only  comment  to  that  is  in  the  Na-
tional  Lab  proposal  we  recognize  transportation  up  front  as  one  of
the key critical resources that need to be addressed up front. So in
the  case  of  AMS,  we  were  forced  into  this  because  we  lost  our
transportation  system  when  Columbia  disaster  occurred.  In  the
case  of  the  National  Lab  we  recognize  this  as  a  weakness  that
needs  to  be  addressed,  and  we  are  going  to  work  it  up  front  with
our partners and not mislead them and assume that transportation
is  available.  That  is  something  that  we  have  to  work,  and  we  are
trying  to  provide  a  better  expectation  for  what  can  be  done  with
the Space Station.

Mr. LAMPSON. It is something obviously that I have a significant
amount  of  interest  in,  and  I  hope  over  time  we  will  look  for  some
innovative  ways  that  we  might  be  able  to  find  the  opportunity  to
make  this  piece  of  equipment  be  able  to  be  deployed  on  the  Inter-
national Space Station.

My  time  has  expired,  and  I  would  recognize  the  gentleman  from

California, Mr. Rohrabacher.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much.

RESEARCH ON ISS

Dr. Neitzel, is there anything that you can point to that we have
achieved—of  great  value  from  scientific  research—Shuttle?  Excuse
me. On the Station?

Dr.  NEITZEL.  On  the  Station?  The  number  of  investigations  that
have been done so far have been somewhat limited due to the com-
pression  of  the  assembly  sequence  post-Columbia.  I  can’t  say  I  am
personally  aware  of  any  experiments  that  I  would  say  have  led  to
groundbreaking  research,  but  there  are  some  experiments  that
have gotten some results that could be——

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Results  but  nothing  near  the  value  that  we

were led to believe would evolve from the Space Station.

Dr.  NEITZEL.  Perhaps  not  yet,  but  that  is  partly  due  to  the  fact
that  the  resources  are  limited,  and  the  transportation  resources  to
carry these payloads are limited. So we have many pieces of facility
class hardware that are yet to be flown to the Station and utilized.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  The,  we  are  talking  now  about—is  there
something  that  we  might  be  able  to  do  in  terms  of—has  NASA  of-
fered  this  asset  properly  to  the  private  sector  and  to  a  university
system or should we being doing something else that would permit
us to open up that opportunity?

Dr.  NEITZEL.  I  can’t  speak  too  much  to  the  private  sector.  That
would be something Mr. Gerstenmaier would be better qualified to
address. However, from the standpoint of the academic community,
NASA has been sending the wrong message with the decimation of
that research community effectively December of 2005. There were
several  hundred 
investigators  who  were  essentially  removed
from——

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  given  budget  restraints,  okay,  given
budget  restraints  and  people,  believe  me,  you  just  say  to  them—
pay. We are going to subsidize what you want to accomplish. Given
budget  restraints,  is  there  something  that  we  can,  some  way  we
can  attract  more  investment  from  the  universities  or  from  the  pri-
vate  sector  in  a  way  that  would  be—necessary  bottom  line  for  us
actually to get it done?

Dr. NEITZEL. Well, there needs to be a baseline research commu-
nity  in  place  to  effectively  utilize  the  International  Space  Station
upon  assembly  complete,  and  that  community  no  longer  exists.
Now, last year several of us were asked to provide some estimates
for the amount of funds it might cost to keep alive a research com-
munity  in  this  era  where  we  have  limited  opportunities  for  flight
but  could  still  have  extensive  ground-based  work  that  could  be  de-
veloping  flight  experiments,  you  know,  therefore,  enabling  their
conduct  aboard  the  ISS  at  assembly  complete.  That  community
came up with a figure of on the order of $70 million, which, in my
budget is enormous but in the scheme of things it is not a particu-
larly  large  number.  And  it  seems  to  me  that  that  kind  of  figure
ought to be able to be found easily within the existing NASA budg-
et or through an additional appropriation.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. I will have to say that I don’t think $70 mil-
lion is easily found in anybody’s budget these days—and I give Ad-
ministrator  Griffin  credit.  He  is  trying  his  very  best,  and  every
time you turn around when people suggest that finding things like

$70  million  is  easy,  that  just  isn’t  the  case  anymore.  And  I  think
we  need  some  very  creative  approaches,  and  I  am  very,  you  know,
I  am  happy  that  NASA  is  trying  to  bring  the  private  sector  into
bringing down some of the costs.

Of course, there is a risk factor in that perhaps the private sector
launch  capacity  that  we  would  hope  was  being  developed,  that
might  not  work.  Do  we  have,  is  not  the,  are  not  the  Russians  a
back up if this does not work? If this is not successful and our own
private  sector  is  not  capable  of  achieving  the  goals  that  they  have
set for themselves?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  I  think  our  international  partners,  the  Rus-
sians,  also  the  automated  transfer  vehicle,  and  then  the  Japanese
HTV transit vehicle are also, are all viable back ups for us.

We  still  have  the  Iran  and  Syria  Nonproliferation  Act  that  we
need  to  deal  with  beyond  2012,  and  we  will  do  that  at  the  right
time.

ENHANCED USE LEASING

Mr. ROHRABACHER. And in terms of actually utilizing the Station,
what  we  are  talking  about  is  utilizing  it  more  for,  let  the  private
sector  go  in  and  let  them  try  and  find  some  creative  uses  for  us.
That leads me to Mr. Gerstenmaier—expanding enhanced use leas-
ing, and in 2003, NASA was granted enhanced use leasing author-
ity  to  permit  the  agency  to  lease  underutilized  property  and  other
consideration  as  a  demonstration  program  at  the  Kennedy  Space
Center and at Ames Research Center. Now, we have expanded that
or  we  permitted  that  to,  sort  of  as  an  example  to  see  what  can  be
done.  Have  we  learned  something?  Can  that  now,  are  there  other
facilities,  other  NASA  facilities  that  can  be  brought  into  play  that
are now underutilized?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  We  would  like  to  open  that  up  to  all  NASA
centers.  We  think  especially  as  the  Shuttle  systems  are  retired  we
will have some facilities available to us that would be attractive po-
tentially  to  the  commercial  sector  to  utilize  and  to  lease  from  us,
and then we would like to take the funds from that, the excess ca-
pacity, and use those for other things, promote the more-NASA di-
rect  adventures  and  activities.  So  we  think  that  the  model  worked
well  with  the  two  centers.  We  would  like  to  expand  that  to  all  ten
centers.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Is there any estimate as to how much money

might be, revenue might be generated from this?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. I don’t have an estimate with me today, but

we could take that for the record and see——

[The information follows:]

NASA ESTIMATE FOR ANNUAL REVENUE FROM ENHANCED USE LEASING AGREEMENTS
NASA is able to extrapolate reasonable estimates of the total value of the annual
revenue  to  be  received  from  existing  leases  based  on  the  prior  year’s  total  annual
revenue  received.  As  outlined  in  the  NASA  2006  Enhanced  Use  Leasing  (EUL)  An-
nual Report submitted to the Congress on April 24, 2007, the Agency reported $1.3
million  in  annual  revenue  received.  Some  of  this  was  received  for  common  services
(such as security and fire protection) provided to all entities on the Center including
the  tenants;  other  portions  were  for  rent  of  the  actual  land  or  facility.  However,
NASA is not able to estimate the amount of revenue that will be received from EUL
leases that have not yet been entered into. As part of the FY 2008 Omnibus Appro-
priations  Act  (P.L.  110–161),  Congress  provided  NASA  with  expanded  EUL  author-

52

ity  for  all  NASA  Centers,  effective  December  31,  2008.  Consequently,  beginning  in
2009, NASA expects an increase in the number of EUL leases that the Agency will
enter  into,  and  therefore  an  increase  in  the  annual  revenue  that  NASA  receives.
Nevertheless,  even  though  many  of  the  NASA  Centers  that  currently  do  not  have
EUL  authority  have  ideas  for  potential  EUL  leases,  there  is  no  way  to  develop  an
estimate for revenue from those potential leases until the parties to the leases have
entered  into  discussions  for  the  actual  amount  of  land,  or  facility,  or  portion  of  a
facility that will be out-leased.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Would  it  be  possible  with  this  approach  that
we  might  be  able  to  come  up  with  $70  million  that  might  be  used
someplace else, for example?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. I think based on the limited results we have
seen  from  the  two  centers,  I  think  that  is  a  little  bit  on  the  high
side  of  what  is  available,  but  it  sure  helps,  and  as  you  described
in  today’s  tough  budget  environment,  any  funds  that  we  can  get
and  use  is  definitely  advantageous  to  us.  And  then  we  think  there
will be some facilities that can definitely be a win-win for the gov-
ernment and also for the private sector to get use of a unique facil-
ity in a unique location.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. This isn’t the old days where people can just
find  $70  million,  so  we  have  to  make  sure  we  use  every  creative
idea  we  have,  and  we  do  have  an  asset  in  the  Space  Station,  and
we  ought  to  see  if  there  is  some  creative  uses,  that  could  possibly
go on there where we could generate some more resources as well.
So not just savings in terms of how we utilize the Station. Actually
the generating of resources.

Thank you very much.
Mr.  LAMPSON.  The  gentleman  makes  some  very  strong  points  in
comparison  to  the  cost.  We  paid,  I  think  paid  so  far  some  $30  bil-
lion  in  its  construction,  $70  million  does  not  seem  like  a  huge
amount in comparison, and I think we will spend $100 billion over
the lifetime of its operation. So let us hope we get it.

STATUS OF U.S.A. STRIKE AND ITS AFFECT ON THE SHUTTLE

Switch  to  something  that  I  am  not,  I  don’t  want  this  Committee
to be taking sides on, but I would like to know, Mr. Gerstenmaier,
the  status  of  contract  negotiations  between  the  striking  Inter-
national Association of Machinist Workers who are involved in the
processing of the Space Shuttle and the United Space Alliance. Can
you give me an indication of what is happening?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  I  don’t  have  direct  insight  into  that.  Our
contractors  are  involved  in  those  discussions  and  negotiations.  At
this  time  the  strike  is  still  ongoing,  and  we  are  able  to  essentially
continue to process with limited support from our non-union work-
ers down in Florida, and things are—I don’t have the status of the
latest negotiations.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  Okay.  Has  NASA  evaluated  the  safety  concerns

voiced by the striking International Association of Machinists?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Yes,  we  have.  We  have  been  very  careful  to
make sure that we are not progressing in any unsafe manner, that
we  have  the  proper  skills,  training  for  all  our  workforce,  that  we
haven’t  cut  back  on  any  of  our  certifications  of  any  of  our  workers
for  any  jobs  or  any  tasks  in  light  of  this.  So  we  have  made  sure
that  we  are  processing  the  vehicles  in  a  safe  manner,  and  so  far

53

we  have  done  that.  If  we  see  anything  that  is  out  of  bounds,  we
would stop the activity and not proceed.

Mr. LAMPSON. Can you give us some of the steps that NASA has
taken  to  insure  that  the  Shuttle  processing  activities  associated
with the next Shuttle launch are being conducted safely during the
strike?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Yes.  We  provided  some  additional  insight
and  oversight  during  some  critical  activities  that,  to  make  sure
that we had all the right personnel supporting the activities, espe-
cially  some  of  the  vertical  assembly  building  processing.  We
brought  some  extra  NASA  safety  inspectors  in,  some  extra  quality
folks in to actually watch that activity to make sure that it was oc-
curring  correctly,  and  we  also  reviewed  the  certification  and  train-
ing  records  to  make  sure  that  the  employees  doing  the  work  were
adequately trained and prepared to do the jobs to which they were
assigned.

Mr. LAMPSON. And then what are the implications, if any, of the

strike for the Shuttle launch schedule?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Again,  near-term  we  don’t  see  an  impact  to
the near-term launch schedule. If the strike continues, we will have
to continue to evaluate and to review, and again, as I stated, if we
see anything that doesn’t look right, we will stop the operation and
no longer proceed. But we are continuing to evaluate and so far we
have been affected but not overly affected.

SHUTTLE LAUNCH SCHEDULE

Mr.  LAMPSON.  Thank  you.  Your  testimony  notes  that,  ‘‘When  we
fly systems as capable and as complex as the Space Shuttle and the
ISS in such a dynamic environment, we always have to prepare, be
prepared  for  the  unexpected  and  be  agile  enough  to  react  quickly
and effectively.’’

What  contingency  plans  does  NASA  have  in  the  event  that
weather  or  some  other  unforeseen  event  delays  the  Shuttle  launch
schedule to the point that assembly of the ISS cannot be completed
by  2010,  the  date  that  the  Shuttle  is  supposed  to  be  retired  and
no more flown?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  We  have  put  together  a  manifest  that  has
some robustness in it. You can see that our last Shuttle flight ends
in  July  of  2010,  and  we  have  until  September  30  of  2010.  There
is  some  margin  there.  We  also  have  the  ability  to  optimize  that
manifest a little bit and move some things around to actually gain
some more margin if we need to, if we have another weather event,
then we can move things around.

We also have the sequence and the flights ordered in a sequence
that if we have to drop a flight at the end, it is our lowest priority
flight, and we would make that evaluation when the time comes to
drop  the  appropriate  flight  that  needs  to  be  dropped  if  it  falls  be-
yond that timeframe.

And, again, so I think we have prepared as much as we can. We
have robust manifests. We look at this from an overall standpoint,
from, it is not a single system that can cause us to delay. It is the
entire system. We are looking at it continuously. We are prepared.
We  have  some  margin  to  take  some  other  weather  delays.  And  in
fact,  this  year  we  have  planned  three  flights.  We  plan  a  flight  in

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:35 Jan 24, 2008 Jkt 036737 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\072407\36737 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

54

August,  a  flight  in  October,  and  a  flight  in  December.  Quite  pos-
sibly  that  December  flight  may  not  occur  just  because  of  vertical
assembly,  building  scheduling,  and  single  high  bay  that  is  avail-
able.  That  flight  may  move  into  January.  We  have  already  evalu-
ated  that.  That  can  occur  without  any  impact  to  the  downstream
flights, and we will still be okay to accomplish the missions.

POSSIBILITY FOR AN ADDITIONAL SHUTTLE FLIGHT

Mr.  LAMPSON.  If  somehow  or  other  Congress  did  miraculously
find the extra money for another flight, is it possible that we have
the capability of building the fuel tanks and whatever else, support
to it? Or is that gone?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  We  are  in  the  process  right  now  of  termi-
nating a lot of contracts and subcontracts. So at this point we prob-
ably  still  could  reasonably  add  another,  we  have  enough  ability  to
buy enough spares to potentially put together another flight. Later
this year and into next year we will eventually lose that ability be-
cause we will have turned off spares and suppliers. So we are kind
of  in  a  transition  period.  There  is  not  a  single  point  in  time,  but
it is becoming more and more difficult to actually add an additional
flight.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  Mr.  Holloway  and  Ms.  Chaplain  both,  would  you

all care to comment on any of those, please?

Ms. CHAPLAIN. I would just add that if another flight was added,
it  would  further  compress  schedule.  So  you  are  just  adding  a  little
bit more risk to that schedule that needs to be negotiated.

The  other  thing  I  understand  with  some  of  these  spares  is  that
NASA  is  still  learning  their  failure  rate  time  periods,  and  that
learning will occur for several years forward, and it won’t be known
until  late  in  the  schedule,  you  know,  do  shifts  need  to  be  made,
what  should  be  on  that  last  flight,  you  know.  All  those,  there  is  a
lot  of  questions  that  are  going  to  be  out  there  for  the  next  couple
of years just of the need to learn the lifespan of some of these ma-
terials that are, need to be on board.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  Well,  what  is  magic  about  that  schedule?  Why
couldn’t  a  flight  be  added  at  the  end  or  of  what  is  presently  the
existing schedule?

Ms.  CHAPLAIN.  As  I  mentioned  in  my  testimony,  there  is  about
two, you know, they need 35 days between flights, and we have es-
timated  2.7  months  between  flights  right  now.  So  it  is  just  adding
another  flight  further  compresses  that  time  period  to  turn  the
launches around and get ready for the next one. It is still probably
achievable. It just adds more schedule risk.

Mr. LAMPSON. But no possibility of extending that schedule?
Ms. CHAPLAIN. Past 2010?
Mr. LAMPSON. Uh-huh.
Ms. CHAPLAIN. You would have to ask NASA.
Mr. LAMPSON. Okay. Well, I am trying to get your feeling of that.
Mr. Holloway.
Mr.  HOLLOWAY.  I  believe  the  Space  Shuttle  team  has  a  great
deal  of  flexibility  to  deal  with  a  near-term  and  a  short-duration
schedule  upset  such  as  Mr.  Gerstenmaier  mentioned.  I  think  in,
over  the  course  of  the  next  three  years  I  think  they  will  be  able
to deal with those short-term weather delays of a week or two and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:35 Jan 24, 2008 Jkt 036737 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\072407\36737 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

55

so  on  and  so  forth.  And  in  the  near-term  they  can  go  much  faster
than  they  go  for  the  long  haul,  if  you  understand  what  I  mean  by
that, and can make up for lost ground.

However,  I  would  suspect  that  it  would  be  most  difficult  to  re-
cover  from  a  long-term  delay  such  as  the  damage  to  the  tank  that
occurred.

Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
I recognize Mr. Feeney for five minutes.
Mr. FEENEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
ORBITAL DEBRIS

I  have  one  more  question  on  the  micrometeoroid  debris.  Mr.
Holloway, in your calculations where you say we can get that over
a  ten-year  period  to,  you  know,  five  percent  risk  of  a  catastrophic
event. Have you taken into account the fact that we expect to dou-
ble the size of the Space Station before completion?

Mr.  HOLLOWAY.  Yes,  sir.  That  was  taken  into  consideration  in

the basic calculations that was provided to us by NASA.

Mr. FEENEY. Well, I don’t want to be too alarmist. I live in Flor-
ida,  and  over  the  next  ten  years  the  chance  my  house  gets  hit  by
a  catastrophic  event,  a  hurricane  or  tornados,  is  probably  at  least
a  good  five  percent.  So,  that  is  something  that  we  all  ought  to  be
aware of.

NASA AND ITAR

For  Mr.  Gerstenmaier,  the  task  force  has  strongly  recommended
that the State Department should give relief from ITAR. They have
done that in the short range here, but given the fact that we have,
you  know,  reports  in  the  last  24  hours,  for  example,  have  talked
about  the  Chinese  domestic  spying  for  both  economic  and  military
reasons,  and  they  seem  to  have  enhanced  capabilities  and  access,
which  is  very  troubling.  What  type  of  plans  does  NASA  have  as  it
seeks  these  necessary  waivers  so  we  can  get  cooperation  with  con-
tractors  that  do  international  work  and  international  partners.
What  type  of  plans  do  we  have  to  insure  that  there  is  oversight
that  we  do  not  allow  critical  technologies  to  get  into  the  wrong
hands?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  In  the  case  of  the  Space  Station,  you  know,
we are partners, are part of essentially a memorandum agreement
and  government  agreements  that  are  in  place  that  insure  that  we
don’t  transfer  data  back  and  forth  amongst  ourselves  unneces-
sarily. So I think there is some protection already within the Space
Station itself.

In  the  case  of  the  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle,  we  pursued
through the State Department and with our contractors all the nec-
essary  agreements,  the  technical  agreements  to  get  in  place  to  en-
sure that we would not transfer data inappropriately, and that has
worked well. We still would like to have some more restrictions re-
moved.  The  things  that  have  become  problematic,  for  example,  is
if  a  failure  occurs  on  the  Automatic  Transfer  Vehicles  that  is  ap-
proaching  the  Space  Station,  we  need  to  have  the  ability  to  talk
with  our  international  partners  about  what  that  failure  was  and
how it occurred to avoid that spacecraft from hitting the Space Sta-

tion or causing it damage. And so we need some relaxation in those
kind of dealings in the real time environment.

So  we  are  speaking  or  seeking  specific  changes  and  specific  lim-
ited areas that won’t overall impact the transfer of critical informa-
tion.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Mr.  Gerstenmaier,  which  of  the  task  force  key  rec-
ommendations do you agree with, which do you disagree with, and
which are you sort of undecided about?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  I  think  we  agree  with  all  the  recommenda-
tions, and we are aggressively moving out on them. They are going
to  take  a  significant  amount  of  time  for  us  to  implement.  In  some
cases  multiple  years.  Some  of  them  are  out  of  our  direct  control.
Some  of  them  rely  on  State  Department.  Some  of  them  rely  on
some  potential  Congressional  funding,  but  the  ones  that  we  have
control  of  we  are  moving  out  as  fast  as  we  can,  and  we  would,  we
anticipate  we  will  be  able  to  satisfy  all  the  recommendations.  In
fact, they were a very good set of data for us to work on.
FEASABILITY OF ADDITIONAL SHUTTLE FLIGHTS

Mr. FEENEY. Would there have been discussions about a number,
a  completion  of  a  number  of  missions,  Mr.  Rohrabacher  talked
about  one,  Congressman  Lampson  when  he  was  in  the  Chair.
Other  than  budgetary  constraints  and  Congress’s  willingness  to
fund  it,  is  there  any  technical  reason  that  you  are  aware  of,  and
Mr.  Holloway,  the  same  thing,  that  if  the  Shuttle  had  to  fly  an
extra two or three missions, it took an extra six months or a year,
is there any technical reasons we are aware of that that is a prac-
tical impossibility for technical reasons or capabilities?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. There is not a technical reason that that can
occur.  The  problem  becomes  budgetary,  that  if  that  money  then
comes from exploration, then that takes money away from the con-
stellation  vehicles,  the  Orion  and  Ares  vehicles  and  delays  that
generation  of  the  next  vehicle,  because  the  NASA  budget  is  essen-
tially  capped  at  a  certain  level.  So  that  is  the  constraint.  Tech-
nically  it  is  viable  but  then  programmatically  it  just  makes  a
longer delay in where we are.

The  other  piece  is  that  the  Shuttle  is  really  necessary  for  these
assembly  flights  and  that  extra  complexity  and  that  extra  care  is
warranted.  We  would  like  to  migrate  to  a  newer  vehicle  that  is
more dedicated to crew transport, that is a little simpler to operate,
potentially  a  little  bit  easier  to  operate  than  the  Shuttle.  So  we
want  to  get  to  the  new  vehicle  as  soon  as  we  can.  So  delaying  the
Shuttle because of the funding constraints delays that next vehicle,
which keeps us from where we want to go in the future.

Mr.  FEENEY.  With  permission  of  the  Chair  for  a  moment,  the
new  vehicle  does  have  a  lot  more  flexibility  and  capability  but  not
in terms of the size of the payload. And so to the extent that some
of these are payload size issues, the bottom line is that if Congress
and  the  Administration  in  the  future  decide  that  we  need  to  have
an  extra  mission  or  two,  and  it  needs  to  last  an  extra  six  months
or  two,  that  is  kind  of  in  our  hands.  There  is  no  technical  reason
you are aware of or Mr. Holloway is aware of that that is an impos-
sibility?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. No technical reason.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Feeney.  Thank  you,  Mr.
Gerstenmaier.  That  is  actually  a  very  good  point  to  keep  in  mind
that Ranking Member Feeney mentioned.

STATUS AND FUTURE OF ISS RESEARCH

Dr. Neitzel, if I could turn to you, there is testimony on both the
status  of  and  the  outlook  for  the  Station  research.  If  I  could,  I
would  like  to  throw  a  few  questions  at  you  and  then  you  can  pick
and choose the order in which you would answer those.

The  first  one  would  be  do  you  think  the  situation  is  irreversible
and could it be fixed, and I would then move to a follow on, which
is  if  it  isn’t  irreversible,  what  would  be  your  highest  priority  rec-
ommendations for fixing it. And that would be what could Congress
do,  and  then  as  a  follow  on  to  that  question  about  Congress,  what
would  the  role  of  NASA  and  the  Administration  be  fixing  a  situa-
tion that, again, you pointed out is pretty sobering.

Appreciate your thoughts on this.
Dr.  NEITZEL.  Well,  the  research  community  is  down  to  next  to
nothing  right  now.  There  are  a  few  non-exploration  research
projects sponsored in academic institutions. I am fortunate enough
to have one of them, a small one. I don’t think the situation is irre-
versible at this time, but I think if we wait too much longer, it may
become  irreversible.  As  I  pointed  out  in  my,  in  both  my  oral  and
written testimony, a large number of the people who were working
on  these  NASA-related  projects  have  now  moved  onto  other  pur-
suits.  These  people  have  lots  of  interests,  and  there  are  lots  of
other  places  to  receive  funding  to  support  research  and  to  support
graduate students and undergraduate students.

However,  there  are  probably  still  some  experiments  that  had
been in the planning and development stages prior to the cancella-
tion of these projects that may be able to be taken out of the closet,
dusted off, and revitalized. So they could be flown perhaps as early
as 2010.

The  problem  is  that  a  flight  experiment  used  to  take  seven  or
eight  years  to  get  to  to  space.  With  the  development  and  the  very
wise decision by the, by NASA in my opinion to develop these facil-
ity  class  payloads,  that  development  time  for  experiments  that
could utilize those facility class hardware payloads was going to be
brought  down  to  about  four  years.  That  is  the  length  of  time  that
a faculty member gets interested in now because that is the length
of time over which a Ph.D. student is typically trained.

So  I  still  think  there  would  be  interest  in  a  large  fraction  of  the
community  that  had  been  involved  in  NASA-related  research  to
come  back  and  continue  with  the  research,  if  their  other  commit-
ments allow it.

Your second question was if it isn’t possible, the highest priority
for  fixing  it.  I  think  I  sort  of  wrapped  both  of  those  answers  into
that,  and  the  role  of  NASA  is  that  NASA  has  to,  and  the  govern-
ment  as  a  whole  has  to  commit  to  a  long-term  support  of  funda-
mental  and  applied  research  aboard  the  ISS  in  order  to  get  this
community back to the fold. No one is going to want to come back,
revitalize a piece of research, start working again on a flight exper-
iment,  only  to  be  told  a  year  from  now  that  the  priorities  have
changed again and your work isn’t needed.

So  I  think  there  needs  to  be  a  long-term  commitment  to  the
science  community  to  support  research  that  will  ultimately  get
done aboard the ISS.

Chairman  UDALL.  Would  you  expand  a  little  bit  more  on  that
length  of  that  commitment  and  any  more  specific  thoughts  you
might have about what that commitment would involve? From, this
is from NASA.

Dr. NEITZEL. Well, I believe you were out of the room when I re-
sponded to Mr. Rohrabacher that the community had come up with
a  keep-alive  number  of  about  $70  million  per  year  that  would  be
required to sustain an effort, roughly half of what it was before the
December,  2005,  Christmas  letters  that  we  received  from  NASA
that  canceled  the  research  program.  I  think  at  the  minimum  that
kind  of  a  financial  commitment  needs  to  be  made  by  NASA  to  in-
sure  that  there  is  enough  community  left  with  experiments  in  the
pipeline to be able to effectively utilize the facilities aboard the ISS
out until its projected lifetime ends.

If  we  think  about  that  pipeline  requiring  three  or  four  years  to
get something to space, then experiments that are going to be done
in  2010  had  already  better  be  started,  and  the  ones  that  would
start now would then go into the years beyond 2010, taking us out
to 2015, or whenever the ISS ceases to be viable.

Chairman  UDALL.  Yes. 

that  Congressman
Rohrabacher’s  open  to  further  persuasion  by  the  Ranking  Member
and  even  myself  when  it  comes  to  making  that  additional  invest-
ment.

I  understand 

Dr. NEITZEL. That is good to hear.
Chairman  UDALL.  Well,  I  thank  you,  Dr.  Neitzel,  for  your  input
and  your  insight.  I  think  this  is  a  very  important  point  you  have
raised. The Chair looks forward to working with you.

Dr. NEITZEL. Thank you very much.
Chairman  UDALL.  The  Chair  recognizes  the  gentleman  from

Texas for five minutes.

SHUTTLE CONTINGENCY FLIGHTS

Mr.  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Gerstenmaier,  in
Mr. Holloway’s testimony he states that the ISS Independent Safe-
ty Task Force recommended that NASA commit to carrying out two
so-called  contingency  Shuttle  flights  to  insure  that  the  ISS  will
have the needed spares in place prior to the retirement of the Shut-
tle.  In  fact,  he  states  in  his  view  that  NASA  should,  ‘‘Develop  an
option  that  insures  that  the  two  remaining  Shuttle  exterior  flights
are  given  the  highest  priority  for  flight  in  front  of  Node  3  if  nec-
essary  to  avoid  exacerbating  a  problem  should  all  planned  Shuttle
flights not be completed.’’

Those  are  pretty  forceful  and  unambiguous  statements.  Do  you
agree  that  the  two  contingency  flights  should  become  part  of  the
baseline?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Yes.  Technically  I  think  that  is  something
we  need  to,  we  need  to  fly  those  flights  for  the  reasons  we  have
discussed.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  And  then  what  about  his  personal  recommenda-

tion that they be given the highest priority for flight?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. Again, I think I would soften that a little bit
just to see what our failure rate is over the next year, and I recog-
nize  we  won’t  have  perfect  data,  but  I  sure  will  have  a  lot  better
data after seeing how well this hardware performs in one year, and
then  we  could,  then  we  will  make  a  decision  on  whether  they  are
the highest priority as you described.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  And  then  when  will  the  final  status  of  the  two
contingency flights be nailed down, and who needs to make the de-
cision on whether to include them in the Shuttle manifest?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  They  are  currently  in  our  budget  right  now,

and we plan to seek to officially add them this summer.

Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Holloway and Ms. Chaplain, would you please

comment on that line of questioning?

Mr.  HOLLOWAY.  I  don’t  have  anything  to  add  except  I  suspect
when  it  plays  out  those  two  flights  will  be  critical  in  maintaining
the,  particularly  the  external  spares.  As  you  know,  today  there  is
not  a  capability  to,  outside  the  Shuttle  to  launch  external  spares,
and so NASA will be dependent upon the emerging Japanese capa-
bility  or  the  COTS  capability.  And  neither  of  those  are  a  sure
thing, at least in the short-term.

So,  again,  I  believe  as  the  task  force  recommended  that  getting
these  two  flights  done  is  extremely  important  to  maintain  the  via-
bility of the Station.

Mr. LAMPSON. Ms. Chaplain.
Ms.  CHAPLAIN.  I  agree  with  Mr.  Holloway,  and  would  just  add,
though, that not having Node 3 go up does further hamper the abil-
ity to conduct research on the Station. So it is another tradeoff that
makes  research  more  difficult  to  do,  but  it  is  a  tradeoff  you  have
to make if you want to sustain the Station.

Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, I for one and probably peo-
ple  may  start  throwing  things  at  me  when  I  say  this,  but  I  think
it  would  be  very,  very  worth  our  while  to  see  if  we  can’t  begin  to
lobby  our  own  colleagues  to  find  the  money  necessary  to  do  more
of the science. Sure it is going to cost us more money, but we chose
to  dream,  and  we  chose  to  dream  big,  and  now  for  us  to  back  off
on—doesn’t make a lot of sense to me.

I  will  put  my  neck  on  the  line  and  go  out  and  start  asking  for
support  for  the  increased  resources  necessary  to  do  these  things.
Science  is  critically  important.  It  should  be  more  than  $70  million
in  my  opinion,  and  when  we  begin  to  skimp,  it  just  seems  like  we
shortchange ourselves. We have gotten huge returns from what we
have  learned  in  the  past,  financial  returns.  We  created  significant
industries,  we  have  made,  created  untold  numbers  of  jobs  and  put
exceptionally  great  amounts  of  money  into  the  economy.  When  we
choose to look and play small, we, I think, give away, we give away
our future.

At  any  rate,  I  am  volunteering  to  work  with  you  and  any  of  the
rest  of  us  in  Congress  to  try  to  make  these  things  happen.  Dream
and  tell  us  those  dreams  and  we  have  the  responsibility  to  try  to
make them come true.

I will yield back my time.
Chairman UDALL. The gentleman from Texas is as always coura-
geous  and  well  spoken,  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  him  to

60

make sure we make the maximum usage of this leadership in that
regard.

The gentleman from Florida is recognized for five minutes.
Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  thanks,  and  I  appreciate  Congressman
Lampson’s encouragement and agree with that. I should know, my
understanding  is  our  Appropriations  Committee  in  the  House  has
put  in  plans  the  capability  to  fund  the  two  contingency  missions,
which  for  the  long-term  health  and  resiliency  and  longevity  of  the
Shuttle  apparently  are  very  important  according  to  the  task  force
recommendation.  I  don’t  think  Mr.  Gerstenmaier  disagrees,  and  so
I also think that having reestablished a regular schedule with some
successes  will  make  it  easier  for  Congressman  Lampson  and  the
Chairman  and  others  to  encourage  our  colleagues  that  an  invest-
ment  in  future  science  programs,  I  mean,  if  you  weren’t  going  to
get the Shuttle back up safely on a regular basis. I can understand
a lot of reticence.

So the successes that we have had, Mr. Gerstenmaier, will allow
us  to  make  credible  arguments  along  the  lines  as  Congressman
Lampson suggested.

WORKFORCE TRANSITION

I  want  to  leave  with  one  last  thing  that  is  obviously  a  passion
of  mine.  We  have  got  a  huge  workforce  at  NASA  in  the  Kennedy
Space Center area and with the many contractors that service that
area.  We  learned  lessons  after  Apollo  about  the  loss  of  workforce
within a transition after Apollo. We learned lessons after the Chal-
lenger  disaster  about  the  irreplacability  of  the  special  capabilities
and skills. Dr. Neitzel is testifying today about the problems in life
sciences  because  we  have  dramatically  slowed  down  emphasis  in
those areas. What does each of you recommend briefly that you can
do  as  you  complete  the  International  Space  Station  and  retire  the
Shuttle  that  will  make  the  transition  for  employees  and  workforce
skills as seamless as possible?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  From  our  perspective  we  are  trying  to  show
that  the  work  we  are  doing  today  has  a  real  benefit  to  the  future
programs.  As  I  described  in  some  of  my  opening  remarks,  a  lot  of
the  systems  on-board  the  Space  Station  that  were  up  and  oper-
ating,  the  pumps  and  systems  that  operate  are  real  systems  that
will  be  used  in  future  exploration  systems,  and  we  have  a  natural
tie between those two.

So  the  folks  that  are  working  on  the  Space  Station  can  see  that
their future and their work is tied, now today is tied to exploration
in the future.

The  same  with  some  of  the  workforce  down  at  the  Kennedy
Space  Center.  We  recently,  we  are  getting  ready  to  stack  the  solid
rocket  motors  for  the  October  flight,  and  typically  we  stack  those
solid  rocket  motors  in  parallel.  We  stack  one  side,  then  the  other
side, and the stacks that then will, the external tank will hang be-
tween.  What  we  are  doing  this  time  is  we  are  just  stacking  one  of
those  boosters,  and  we  are  doing  that  because  we  are  going  to  fly
the Ares 1–X flight in 2009. That will be the first test flight of the
Aries  system  with  dummy  upper  stage  with  just  a  single  booster
off of one of our mobile launch platforms.

61

So we are going to gain data on how much that launch platform
deflects  with  just  a  single  booster  on  it.  We  can  provide  that  data
to the exploration folks.

So,  again,  we  are  showing  a  real  world  tangible  example  of  the
Shuttle workforce is actually preparing the way for the exploration
workforce  to  get  ready.  So  we  are  showing  our  workers  there  is  a
future. The jobs will be different. They may not be operational type
of jobs. They may be more developmental operations kind or more,
they  will  not  be  operational  jobs.  It  will  be  more  developmental  in
nature, but we are showing that there is a future. We are providing
them  training  opportunities  and  allowing  them  to  be  part  of  that
future system today while they are doing their existing job.

Mr. FEENEY. Go ahead, Ms. Chaplain, or anybody else who would
like  to—and  then  I  am  going  to  yield  back  the  balance  of  my  time
when the panel is completed.

Ms.  CHAPLAIN.  I  just  would  make  a  couple  comments  on  work-

force because we have been doing some work in this area.

One  of  the  things  we  would  like  to  see  NASA  do  is  make  sure
it  has  good  measures  to  track  the  progress  of  a  lot  of  the  actions
they  have  been  taking  to  sustain  and  keep  the  critical  skills  that
they  need.  The  activity  of  mapping  skills  that  they  have  now  to
what they need in the future is good, but that needs to be tracked
continually. And government-wide, you know, we have this issue of
retaining  systems  engineers  in-house  in  government  agencies  that
all  agencies  are,  you  know,  facing  problems  in  that  area  and
incentivizing people to stay. And at the same time knowing how to
manage  the  contractors  that  you  are  relying  on  to  conduct  the  ac-
tivities and systems engineering.

So  it  is  just  another  area  they  need  to  pay  special  attention  to

to make sure they don’t lose that critical expertise.

Dr.  NEITZEL.  Might  I  make  a  comment?  I  certainly  would  worry
about  the  ability  to  retain  center  personnel  at  the  various  NASA
research centers who work and support the research payloads that
go  up  to  the  Station  and  have  been  flown  on  the  Shuttle.  There  is
a large body of expertise there that could conceivably be lost as you
pointed  out  in  the  era  between  Apollo  and  the  Shuttle  program.  A
large  number,  a  large  amount  of  institutional  memory  went  away.
I also worry very much about our ability to motivate future gen-
erations  of  young  Americans  to  consider  careers  in  science,  tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics, the STEM disciplines.

We have a hard time right now retaining young people at univer-
sities  who  come  starting  to  study  engineering  and  sciences.  So  we
need  motivators  to  keep  those  kids  interested  and  to  keep  them
wanting  to  pursue  careers  in  science  and  engineering.  And  if  we
take  away  a  large  thing  like  the  space  program,  which  is  one  the
things  that  motivated  me  when  I  was  a  teenager  growing  up  in
Florida, we risk losing the next generation to these kinds of activi-
ties.  Not  just,  not  the  whole  generation  just  because  the  ISS  may
go away, but we really need these kinds of things to help motivate
our kids to pursue careers in technological fields.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  thank  the  gentleman  from  Florida  for  some

terrific questions.

STATUS OF HUBBLE SERVICING MISSION

I am going to direct a final set of questions to Mr. Gerstenmaier.
This is actually one of my favorite assets in the portfolio of NASA,
and  that  is  the  Hubble  telescope.  I  would  like  to  give  you,  Mr.
Gerstenmaier,  a  chance  to  talk  a  little  bit  about  the  status  of  the
preparations  for  the  mission  and  what  do  you  consider  to  be  the
greatest  challenges,  including  that  mission  successfully,  and  is
there  any  chance  that  the  ’08,  launch  date  might  slip  because  of
its accommodate assembly mission to the state?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. We are actively in the process of working on
that mission with the Science Mission Directorate, and the Science
Mission  Directorate  is  finalizing  the  activities  that  are  going  to
occur  on  that  flight,  what  specific  instruments  are  going  to  be  re-
paired.  We  have  been  busily  working  with  them  to  insure  that  we
are  prepared  to  go  do  this.  Again,  Space  Station  has  prepared  us
in  a  lot  of  ways  that  we  were  not  prepared  with  before  for  the
Hubble  serving  mission.  We  have  gained  a  lot  of  experience  in
extra-vehicular  activities  or  space  walks  that  will  be,  have  direct
application.  So  I  think  the  teams  are  prepared.  We  are  ready  for
that mission.

Recently  when  we  had  the  hail  damage  to  the  tank,  the  Shuttle
manifest went through a slip, we actually held the Hubble mission
in its position in the calendar dates, and we let some of the Station
missions  slide  beyond  the  Hubble  mission  to  hold  it  in  the  Sep-
tember  timeframe.  I  think  on  paper  we  show  it  now  maybe  in  the
August timeframe. It will probably be in September when we actu-
ally fly the mission. So we have been able to hold the Hubble tele-
scope  even  though  we  had  some  schedule  threats  and  we  let  the
Station flight slip around because, again, we don’t often get to opti-
mize  for  whatever  situation  we  have.  We  have  to  balance  between
the  two,  so  we  balanced  the  risk  of  getting  the  Hubble  serviced  at
the right time against the Station delays, and we made the appro-
priate  decision,  I  believe,  to  hold  the  Hubble  where  it  was.  So,
again, things look pretty good for the Hubble mission.

One  other  thing  I  would  add  is  the  Hubble  telescope  team  is
looking at some innovative tools to actually be able to repair poten-
tially  some  devices  out  on  the  outside.  They  have  developed  a  de-
vice  that  will  hold  screws  that  allows  to  essentially  pop  a  circuit
breaker  out  of  a  device  that  is  on  the  outside  of  the  Hubble  Space
telescope, and replace a card within that computer device.

I  don’t  know  if  we  will  decide  to  do  that  particular  task  on  the
Hubble  mission  or  not,  but  that  has  tremendous  application  to
Space  Station  and  other  vehicles.  We  now  maybe  have  the  ability
to  go  outside  and  repair  a  computer  box  without  having  to  bring
it inside, pop the card up, put a next card in. We may even be actu-
ally able to do that on the outside.

So,  again,  we  are  able  to  learn  from  the  science  group  and  what
they  are  repairing  for  their  repair  mission  and  apply  that  to  Sta-
tion and apply that to exploration. So as long as we stay open and
we continue to work across programs, we can maximize the benefit
as we move forward.

So this mission fits well.

Chairman  UDALL.  Just  out  of  curiosity  since  I  have  a  little  bit
of time left, the procedure you just outlined, in the past has it been
difficult  or  impossible  to  undertake  because  of  zero  gravity  or  be-
cause  of  the  extreme  conditions  that  are  out,  you  find  outside  the
body of the Space Station or the telescope?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. The problem in this case is there is a bunch
of screws, about—I think maybe ten or so screws that actually hold
the  circuit  board  in  place.  Those  screws  are  not  captive.  So  when
you  are  in  the  space  suit  with  the  gloves  and  the  tools,  and  you
back  that  screw  out,  it  typically  floats  away,  and  then  you  are  in
not such good shape.

What  they  have  developed  is  a  simple  plastic  device  that  sits
over  the  top  of  those  screws  and  then  as  the  screw  backs  out  with
the  device,  it  goes  in  and  it  is  held  captive  in  this  plastic  device,
and  then  you  can  change  the  card  out,  put  the  plastic  device  back
on and reinsert the screws back into the circuit board.

So  it  is  a  clever  concept,  a  mechanical  way  to  capture  and  hold
these  screws  or  a  way  to  repair  something  that  wasn’t  intended  to
be  repaired  that  way.  And  I  guarantee  you  we  will  take  benefit  of
that on-board the Space Station, either on the inside or on the out-
side of the Space Station.

Chairman  UDALL.  And  it  also  has  a  useful  in  a  gravity  environ-

ment as well.

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  It  is  not  as  critical  in  the  gravity  environ-
ment  because  gravity  provides  that  force  that  holds  the  device  or
the screw where you want it to be, and in this case it is a——

Mr.  FEENEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  just  out  of  interest,  if  I  may,  sorry

to interrupt, but——

Chairman UDALL. Happy to yield.
Mr.  FEENEY.—I  am  going  to  show  my  scientific  ignorance  here.
That is why I was a dirt lawyer before I got to Congress. Wouldn’t
magnetic capabilities help?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  That  would  be  another  option,  too,  but  the
beauty of this device is you place it on and then all ten screws are
held by this device where some kind of magnetic capability, it may
be a screw at a time, and then you have got the screw magnetically
held  to  your  screwdriver,  and  then  how  do  you  get  it  off  with  this
big glove on? This way it is all held by the mechanical device, and
it  is  a  very  elegant  solution  to  a  fairly  simple  problem  but  a  prob-
lem that we face in zero gravity.

Chairman UDALL. With that I thank the gentleman from Florida
for  his  question.  At  this  point  I  want  to  bring  the  hearing  to  a
close.  I  want  to  thank  all  of  the  witnesses  for  testifying  before  the
Subcommittee  today  on  these  very  important  topics  that  deal  with
the  future  of  the  space  program,  our  competitiveness  agenda,  and
whether  we  are  going  to  be  the  innovator  of  the  world  in  this  re-
gard.

If there is no objection, the record will remain open for additional
statements  from  the  members  and  for  answers  to  any  follow-up
questions the Subcommittee may ask of the witnesses. Without ob-
jection, so ordered.

The hearing is now adjourned.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Mr.  William  H.  Gerstenmaier,  Associate  Administrator,  Space  Oper-

ations Mission Directorate, National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Given  the  European  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  has  taken  approximately  10
years to develop, according to Mr. Holloway’s testimony, what evidence, technical
or  otherwise,  does  NASA  have  to  indicate  that  COTS  systems  will  be  available
within  the  timeframe  NASA  needs  them  to  support  International  Space  Station
(ISS) logistics?

A1. Modern commercial development practices employed by the Commercial Orbital
Transportation Services (COTS) partners are expected to accelerate the development
schedules  for  these  systems.  Also,  the  technology  employed  by  vehicles  to  fly  cargo
or crew to the ISS is well within today’s state-of-the-art. The ISS integration of the
European Space Agency (ESA) Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and the Japanese
Aerospace  Exploration  Agency  (JAXA)  H–II  Transfer  Vehicle  (HTV)  has  provided
valuable  pathfinders  that  make  the  subsequent  integration  of  new  visiting  vehicles
much  easier.  Although  one  COTS  partner  has  encountered  issues  with  financing,
the  other  participant  has  successfully  completed  six  milestones  on  schedule  and
their vehicle is still on track for a final demonstration flight to the ISS in late 2009.
Q2. Has  NASA  assessed  the  technical  status  of  non-U.S.  vehicles  such  as  the  Japa-
nese  HTV  and  European  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  (ATV)  that  are  intended
to provide cargo services to the ISS once the Shuttle has been retired?

A2. NASA  maintains  an  on-going  integration  and  oversight  role  of  the  HTV  and
ATV.  Major  Design  Reviews  and  Technical  Interchange  Meetings  (TIM)  are  regu-
larly conducted to confirm technical progress with the International Partner visiting
vehicles. A representative set of key events for HTV include:

• Critical Design Review 2 in April 2006;
• Proximity  Operations  Preliminary  Qualification  Review  (PROX  PQR)  in  July

2007; Launch Package TIM in June 2007; and,

• HTV Joint Operations Panel (HJOP) in June 2007.

A representative set of key events for ATV include:

• ISS Independent Safety Task Force ATV Review in October 2006;
• NASA Headquarters ATV Review in January 2007;
• PQR in June–Sept. 2007; and,
• Program Manager’s Review in September 2007.

Q2a. What  back-up  cargo  transport  has  NASA  established  should  COTS  and  the

non-U.S. vehicles be unavailable to meet NASA’s logistics schedule for ISS?

A2a. NASA  has  developed  a  plan  for  flying  multiple  cargo  transportation  vehicles
with multiple development timelines to support the ISS. This is a strategy that does
not  depend  solely  on  one  vehicle’s  success  to  ensure  ISS  viability.  NASA  closely
monitors  development  of  the  COTS  vehicles  and  has  strategies  to  react  within  the
appropriate timeframes if the development does not proceed per schedule.

The  Shuttle  manifest  calls  for  10  assembly  flights  to  the  ISS  and  one  to  service
the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  In  addition,  NASA  may  fly  up  to  two  additional  ISS
logistics flights if they are deemed necessary and can be safely flown before the end
of  2010.  As  a  part  of  ISS  assembly,  NASA  will  continue  to  use  the  Space  Shuttle
to  preposition  spares  on  orbit.  This  will  provide  some  schedule  margin  for  new  vis-
iting vehicles.
Q2b. If NASA begins to use COTS systems and a COTS launch failure occurs, what

back-ups would be available to support the ISS?

A2b. NASA  hopes  to  have  multiple  U.S.  providers  available  for  services  and  will
structure the ISS re-supply services contract in a way that will enable multiple pro-
vider  support.  However,  if  a  U.S.  provider  fails  and  an  alternate  U.S.  provider  is
not available, the ISS would utilize alternate transportation capabilities provided by
the International Partners.
Q2c. How far in advance must NASA procure additional Progress, ATV or HTV ve-

hicles?

A2c. The  lead  time  is  about  two  years  for  Progress  manufacturing.  However,  there
is a concern as to whether the infrastructure can support the build, processing and
launch  of  additional  Progress  vehicles  above  the  current  level  planned  for  ISS.  For
ATV and HTV, the lead time is about three years.
Q3a. Mr. Holloway’s testimony refers to ‘‘160,000 pounds of logistics and spares that

must be transported to the Station between 2010 and 2015.’’
Does that mass include logistics needed to support ISS research as well as ISS
research experiments? If so, how much of the total is for each?

A3a. The  mass  does  include  logistics  to  support  ISS  research.  Utilization  demand
comprises  about  39,000  pounds  of  the  160,000  pounds  of  total  ISS  demand  from
2010–2015.
Q3b. How  much  of  the  160,000  pound  logistics  requirement  can  be  satisfied  at

present?

A3b. As  stated  in  the  ISS  Safety  Task  Force  Report,  about  40,000  pounds  will  be
delivered by International Partner vehicles to offset their CSOC obligations. The re-
maining 120,000 pounds (or 54.4 MT) will be delivered on COTS vehicles.
Q3c. What  are  NASA’s  plans  for  securing  transportation  for  the  remaining  logistics

requirements?

A3c. As  stated  above,  COTS  vehicles  will  deliver  the  remaining  120,000  pounds  of
cargo.
Q3d. What logistics support (upmass and downmass) on COTS vehicles, Progress or

Japanese HTV vehicles will be allocated to ISS utilization?

A3d. Given  this  set  of  launch  vehicles  (including  ATV),  100  percent  or  39,000
pounds of the utilization demand will be delivered in the 2010–2015 timeframe.
Q4. With respect to ensuring U.S. access to the ISS,
Q4a. What is the plan for getting U.S. astronauts to and from the ISS after the cur-
rent exemption from the ISS-related payments provisions of the Iran and Syria
Nonproliferation Act expires at the end of 2011?

A4a. Once the Space Shuttle retires and until COTS Capability D or Orion becomes
available, the Russian Soyuz represents the only crew transfer vehicle that can sup-
port ISS crew exchanges and rescue services.
Q4b. Does  NASA  plan  to  seek  legislative  relief  to  allow  payments  to  Russia  for  con-
tinued  ISS  related  crew  transfer  and  crew  rescue  services  after  2011?  If  so,
when will that occur?

A4b. NASA  is  monitoring  the  progress  of  potential  domestic  commercial  providers
to develop cargo and crew transportation services to the International Space Station
(ISS),  and  the  Orion  project  is  on  track  to  reach  its  Initial  Operational  Capability
in  March  2015.  Purchasing  cargo  and  crew  transportation  services  domestically  is
NASA’s  preferred  method  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  ISS.  The  Administration  is  con-
sidering options to maintain a U.S. crew presence aboard the ISS. This may include
relief from the provisions of Iran, North Korea and Syria Non-Proliferation Act (P.L.
106–178, as amended) (‘‘INKSNA’’) for additional Soyuz services to keep a U.S. crew
presence  on  the  ISS  until  either  domestic  commercial  crew  transportation  services,
or  Orion,  become  available.  We  will  keep  the  Congress  fully  informed  of  our  plans.
Q4c. What is the earliest credible date that a commercial crew transfer service might

be available, and what is your estimate of the most likely date?

A4c. The currently funded Space Act Agreements (SAA) with our COTS partners in-
clude  milestones  for  both  a  cargo  and  a  crew  transportation  demonstration,  with
only  the  cargo  demo  milestones  currently  funded.  If  the  crew  transportation  dem-
onstration  option  is  exercised  and  funded  by  NASA  upon  the  successful  conclusion
of the cargo demonstrations, the proposed option’s milestone schedule could support
testing  and  demonstration  of  COTS  crew  transfer  capabilities  as  early  as  2011  or
2012,  after  cargo  is  successfully  flown  on  multiple  flights  and  the  reliability  of  the
new  system  is  established.  One  of  the  Agency’s  funded  COTS  partners  has  com-
pleted all six performance milestones on schedule to date, however significant tech-
nical  challenges  remain  for  completing  the  remaining  milestones.  NASA  will  have
the  ability  to  more  accurately  estimate  the  COTS  Capability  D  availability  window
after additional partner milestones are attempted and met over the next year.

68

Q4d. What  will  you  do  if  neither  commercial  nor  Russian  options  for  crew  transfer

are available to NASA after 2011?

A4d. NASA  anticipates  that  the  Russian  Soyuz  vehicle  will  be  the  only  option  for
crew  transfer  and  emergency  crew  return  capability  for  post-2011  until  Orion  or
COTS Capability D are available.
Q5. Ms.  Chaplain’s  testimony  discussed  the  risks  of  the  COTS  program  given  the
new  relationships  that  NASA  is  developing  with  potential  COTS  providers  and
the fact that new vehicles are being developed. Her testimony also noted that ‘‘it
is critical that NASA establish clear and consistent guidance, limit requirements
changes,  and  ensure  that  it  has  visibility  into  the  progress  being  made  by  the
commercial  suppliers.’’  What,  in  specific  terms,  is  NASA  doing  to  address  these
issues and risks?

A5. The COTS model is a different approach from standard government contracting,
and  the  approach  to  the  development  of  new  vehicles  is  also  different.  The  COTS
partners  are  not  developing  a  system  to  be  operated  by  the  government  or  its  con-
tractors,  but  are  demonstrating  a  capability  that  NASA  can  later  utilize  as  a  com-
mercial service. While these companies develop vehicles that they intend to use com-
mercially, they will assume most of the financial and programmatic risk.

The  Agency’s  COTS  strategy  established  high-level  performance  goals  to  encour-
age  innovation.  The  Agency’s  commercial  partners  are  responsible  for  developing
their own detailed design requirements. Only in the area of ISS, visiting-vehicle in-
tegration and human rating were firm requirements imposed—and these were open
to negotiation.

NASA’s  COTS  strategy  has  much  less  day-to-day  oversight  of  the  commercial
partners  than  in  standard  government  contracting;  however,  insight  is  maintained
by  a  team  of  civil  servants  that  work  with  the  partners  on  a  day-to-day  basis  pro-
viding  assistance  and  monitoring  progress.  This  approach  was  taken  to  encourage
process  innovation  and  to  not  externally  impose  existing  processes  on  the  partners.
This  risk  of  a  partner  not  successfully  demonstrating  its  capabilities  is  mitigated
by  working  with  multiple  commercial  partners  to  maximize  the  probability  of  one
or more partners succeeding. NASA assists the commercial partner’s efforts by pro-
viding  a  network  of  Agency  technical  experts  across  all  discipline  areas  known  as
the  COTS  Advisory  Team  (CAT).  Extensive  NASA  technical  and  facility  resources
are also available to the commercial partners through reimbursable SAAs.

The Government’s financial risk is limited by paying partners only upon the suc-
cessful completion of a pre-negotiated set of performance milestones. If NASA deter-
mines  that  a  partner  has  succeeded  in  a  milestone  based  on  objective  success  cri-
teria,  the  partner  is  paid;  if  not,  no  payment  is  made.  These  milestones  typically
occur  every  three  or  four  months  for  each  commercial  partner  until  the  conclusion
of the COTS Demonstrations project in 2010. These milestone certifications provide
clear evidence of the progress being made by each of the partners.
Q6. What  is  the  status  of  NASA’s  discussions  with  the  Department  of  State  regard-
ing International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) issues and NASA’s ability
to  use  contractors  versus  civil  servants  to  support  the  European  ATV  launch  to
the ISS?

Q6a. What are the issues under review?
Q6b. The  Space  Station  program  has  been  in  existence  as  an  international  partner-
ship for about two decades. Why is ITAR now being raised as an issue for con-
tractors that are integrating and operating the ISS?

A6a,b. NASA’s  discussions  with  the  Department  of  State  regarding  ITAR  impacts
have  addressed  several  topics,  including:  restrictive  provisos  (i.e.,  conditions)  on
Technical Assistance Agreements (TAAs) regarding anomaly resolution and dual-na-
tionals/third-country  nationals;  and  a  possible  limited  ITAR  exemption  for  NASA
contractors implementing NASA international programs. The State Department has
been  working  with  NASA,  the  European  Space  Agency,  and  the  Canadian  Space
Agency to address the subject of restrictive provisos, and the State Department has
indicated that it will publish guidance on its website in the near future to facilitate
progress on activities covered by TAAs in certain cases.

For the longer-term, NASA has also been engaged with the State Department re-
garding  the  potential  development  of  a  tightly-circumscribed  ITAR  exemption  to
allow NASA to authorize certain exports and technical assistance by contractors im-
plementing NASA’s international Government-to-Government agreements. From the
NASA  perspective,  this  proposal  is  based  upon  already-existing  authority  in  the
ITAR  enjoyed  by  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  in  effecting  Foreign  Military

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:35 Jan 24, 2008 Jkt 036737 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\072407\36737 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

69

Sales  and  includes  comprehensive  review  and  reporting  requirements,  to  ensure
that NASA contractors’ ITAR-controlled activities are consistent with NASA’s inter-
national  agreements,  and  that  the  State  Department  is  apprised  of  those  activities
in  a  timely  manner.  The  current  NASA  proposal  is  compatible  with  previous  guid-
ance  provided  by  the  State  Department  as  part  of  prior  efforts  to  work  with  NASA
and  DOD  on  the  creation  of  additional,  reasonable  discretion  under  the  ITAR  in
overseeing major NASA programs. The details and overall feasibility of this proposal
remain under discussion between NASA and the State Department.

The  ITAR  issues  under  discussion  with  the  Department  of  State  are  not  new.
NASA  has  been  engaged  with  the  State  Department  for  over  seven  years  in  efforts
to explore solutions to various ITAR challenges confronting its contractors. Those ac-
tivities have included closer coordination with the State Department on NASA con-
tractors’  license  applications,  efforts  to  revise  unduly  restrictive  license  conditions,
and  the  proposed  development  of  the  limited  ITAR  exemption  referenced  above  to
facilitate  NASA’s  international  cooperative  activities  involving  the  Space  Shuttle
program, the International Space Station program, and major science missions.
Q7. In  its  2006  report,  the  Congressionally-established  Aerospace  Safety  Advisory
Panel  [ASAP]  ‘‘observed  that  launch  decisions  are  too  regularly  elevated  to  the
Administrator  level,  and  the  Panel  noted  the  lack  of  an  analytical  risk-assess-
ment process that is standardized, comprehensive, and well understood through-
out the agency.’’

Q7a. What  is  your  response  to  ASAP’s  findings?  Do  you  agree  with  them,  and  if  so,

what do you plan to do differently?

A7a. This  question  addresses  two  different  but  related  issues:  (1)  flight  risk  issues
elevated to the NASA Administrator level (2) analytical risk assessment capabilities
at NASA. NASA’s response to each aspect of the question is provided below:
Flight Risk Issues Elevated to the NASA Administrator Level

The  decision  of  the  NASA  Administrator  to  become  technically  involved  in  the
Flight  Readiness  Review  (FRR)  process  is  based  on  his  personal  choice  to  do  so.
There  are  currently  no  NASA  or  Shuttle  Program  requirements  or  expectations  for
the Administrator to participate in this capacity.

Under the revised Governance model, any safety of flight risk characterized as un-
acceptable  by  the  Program  Manager,  Engineering  Technical  Authority,  Safety  and
Mission  Assurance  (S&MA)  Technical  authority,  or  Health  and  Medical  Technical
Authority, must be elevated to the next higher level (typically the appropriate Mis-
sion  Directorate  Associate  Administrator).  Since  the  Shuttle  Return  to  Flight,  only
one  Shuttle  flight  risk  issue  that  has  been  elevated  to  the  Headquarters  level  for
decision.  This  case  involved  the  risk  associated  with  debris  liberation  from  the  Ex-
ternal Tank ice/frost ramp (IFR) and the potential for catastrophic Orbiter Thermal
Protection System (TPS) damage. This is the only situation when the Administrator
was  formally  requested  by  the  Space  Shuttle  Program  (SSP)  to  participate  in  the
FRR decision process.
Analytical Risk Assessment Capabilities at NASA

In  relation  to  this  issue,  in  its  2006  Third  Quarterly  Report  of  September  26,
2006,  ASAP  made  a  specific  recommendation  to  NASA.  This  recommendation  is
identified as Recommendation #4 (2006–03–02) on Page 57 of ASAP Annual Report
for 2006. It reads:

‘‘The ASAP recommends that a comprehensive risk assessment, communication
and  acceptance  process  be  implemented  to  ensure  that  overall  launch  risk  is
considered  in  an  integrated  and  consistent  manner.  The  process  should  be
sound, mature, consistently implemented to yield high confidence and consistent
results that are generally accepted by the majority of the community.’’

NASA  accepted  this  recommendation  and  is  in  the  process  of  implementing  it.
NASA’s  implementation  approach  is  documented  on  pages  58  and  59  of  ASAP  An-
nual Report for 2006.
Q8. In  an  April  16,  2007  Wall  Street  Journal  article  on  preparations  for  extending
ISS  operations  past  2016,  NASA  Administrator  Griffin  is  quoted  as  saying
‘‘We’re  discussing  all  of  that  right  now.’’  And  the  article  states  that  Adminis-
trator Griffin added that he would be ‘‘very surprised if the U.S. decides to end
its participation’’ in the Station by 2016.

Q8a. What is the status of those discussions on extending ISS operations past 2016?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:35 Jan 24, 2008 Jkt 036737 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\072407\36737 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

70

A8a. No funding for the ISS is in the budget after 2016. Work to reduce Space Sta-
tion  operations  and  transportation  costs  is  underway.  (Transportation  costs  are  ex-
pected to be roughly 40 percent of the ISS long-term costs.) Affordability and utility
would  need  to  be  weighed  within  the  larger  context  of  the  Nation’s  space  program
in any decision on whether the ISS’s life should be extended beyond 2016. A decision
to  extend  the  life  of  the  ISS  beyond  2016  could  be  made  as  late  as  2010  without
significant cost impacts.
Q8b. Have any of the ISS International Partners expressed views on the matter?
A8b. All of the International Partners are considering the prospects of operating the
ISS  beyond  2016.  Once  the  European  and  Japanese  Laboratories  are  installed  and
operational aboard ISS, all partners will be in a better position to fully evaluate fu-
ture  returns  on  their  national  investments  to  solidify  their  position  regarding  how
long to maintain their ISS operations.
Q8c. When  do  you  expect  a  decision  to  be  made,  and  what  will  be  the  criteria  for

deciding?

A8c. A  decision  to  extend  U.S.  participation  in  the  ISS  beyond  2016  would  depend
on  whether  the  benefits  to  the  Nation  of  continued  operations  are  justifiable,  and
a  determination  on  where  the  ISS  fits  into  the  larger  perspective  of  the  Nation’s
space program after 2016.
Q9. Has NASA prepared a Space Station Utilization Plan that includes a schedule,
specific  milestones,  a  list  of  prioritized  experiments  and  resources  (crew,  logis-
tics, funding) required to implement the plan? If not, why not? If so, please pro-
vide it for the record.

A9. NASA  manages  NASA  Exploration  and  non-Exploration  science  on  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station  (ISS)  through  the  ISS  Exploration  and  Non-Exploration  Re-
search Project Plan and the Human Research Program Utilization Plan for the Inter-
national  Space  Station.  Plans  for  the  multi-agency  utilization  of  the  U.S.  segment
of  ISS  as  a  National  Laboratory  are  being  aggressively  pursued  to  maximize  U.S.
investments  and  reflect  U.S.  priorities.  NASA  and  the  ISS  International  Partners
are developing an updated Consolidated Operations and Utilization Plan (COUP) for
the ISS. The COUP includes a schedule, specific milestones, a list of prioritized ex-
periments  and  resources  (crew,  logistics,  funding)  required  implementing  the  plan.
All  three  documents—the  COUP,  the  ISS  Exploration  and  Non-Exploration  Re-
search  Project  Plan,  and  the  Human  Research  Program  Utilization  Plan  for  the
International  Space  Station—will  be  available  in  December  2007,  and  NASA  will
provide a copy of these documents to the Subcommittee at that time. In June 2006,
pursuant  to  section  506  of  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (P.L.  109–155),
NASA  submitted  a  report  to  the  Space  and  Aeronautics  Subcommittee  outlining  a
research  plan  for  the  NASA  utilization  of  the  ISS.  At  that  juncture  in  time,  the
Shuttle manifest and all the upmass requirements were still being formulated after
the return to flight activity following the Columbia accident.
Consolidated Operations and Utilization Plan

Inputs  from  all  International  Partners  are  consolidated  annually  into  a  Consoli-
dated  Operations  and  Utilization  Plan  (COUP)  that  is  specified  in  the  ISS  Memo-
randa of Understanding between NASA and each of its International Partners. The
COUP includes all available on-orbit resources and all proposed uses for each Inter-
national  Partner’s  allocation  of  Space  Station  user  accommodations  and  utilization
resources. The COUP is developed multilaterally and approved by a multilateral co-
ordination  board  which  is  comprised  of  one  representative  from  each  International
Partner. Once released, the COUP is used to plan supporting launch transportation
services,  return  transportation  services,  on-orbit  resource  allocations,  and  payload
accommodation sites on the ISS. Once complete, a final utilization schedule is devel-
oped and executed. Other strategic plans that inform the COUP update are the ISS
Exploration  and  Non-Exploration  Research  Project  Plan,  and  the  Human  Research
Program Utilization Plan for the International Space Station.
ISS Exploration and Non-Exploration Research Project Plan

This  project  plan  describes  ISS  experiments  to  be  conducted  on  the  CIR,  FIR,
MSRR,  MSG  and  EXPRESS  racks  that  directly  support  both  NASA’s  Exploration
and  Non-Exploration  research  activities.  This  research  focuses  on  reduced  gravity
investigations  in  applied  technology  and  physical  science  fields  such  as  combustion
science,  fluid  physics  and  materials  science.  Descriptions  of  the  experiment  content
and  budgets  for  proposed  experiments  are  included.  The  existing  ISS  utilization
traffic models for the subject facilities forecast the currently planned usage from the

71

present  to  the  2011  time  frame.  Some  of  the  currently  baselined  experiments  are
described  in  this  document  to  present  a  complete  picture  of  the  facility  utilization,
but  the  proposed  new  experiments  described  herein  would  be  conducted  after  2010.
Human Research Program Utilization Plan for the International Space Station

This plan entails the assumption and approach used by the Human Research Pro-
gram,  to  utilize  the  ISS  to  retire  17  of  the  33  health  risks  to  astronauts  baselined
by  the  program  and  most  appropriately  studied  on  ISS.  This  plan  also  takes  into
account  factors  such  as  available  crew  time,  number  of  available  subjects,  upmass
and  downmass  capabilities  and  potential  follow-on  research  that  would  be  required
to retire a risk and validate appropriate countermeasures.
Q9a. A  2006  National  Academies  report  recommends  that  NASA  schedule  periodic
reviews  of  the  ISS  utilization  plan.  Have  any  such  reviews  taken  place?  If  so,
when?

A9a. Consolidated Operations and Utilization Plan

NASA  recognizes  the  importance  of  having  a  consolidated  plan  for  the  operation
and utilization of the International Space Station at assembly complete. To this end,
the  Agency,  in  cooperation  with  the  ISS  partners,  has  been  developing  an  updated
Consolidated  Operations  and  Utilization  Plan  (COUP),  which  is  projected  to  be
available in December 2007. This plan is updated annually by the ISS partnership.
The  U.S.  portion  of  this  plan  will  also  be  reviewed  annually  as  part  of  the  NASA
annual budget formulation process.
ISS  Exploration  and  Non-Exploration  Research  Project  Plan  and  the  Human  Re-

search Program Utilization Plan for the International Space Station

The  plans  cited  above  are  elements  of  the  Exploration  Technology  Development
Program and the Human Research Program of the Exploration Systems Mission Di-
rectorate  (ESMD).  Both  programs  are  subject  to  internal  and  external  reviews  for
research  and  development  proposals  prior  to  implementation  and  for  implemented
proposals,  annual  reviews  are  held  until  completion.  The  external  component  of
these  reviews  may  involve  external  advisory  groups  such  as  the  National  Research
Council  (NRC).  Additional  annual  reviews  are  completed  as  part  of  NASA’s  budget
formulation  and  review  cycle  and  technical  reviews  are  held  in  accordance  with
7120.8.  Currently,  ESMD’s  Exploration  Technology  Development  Program  and  its
ISS  Exploration  and  Non-Exploration  Research  project  are  being  reviewed  by  an
NRC  panel,  per  Congressional  directive  and  Agency  policy.  In  June  of  2008,  the
Human Research Program intends to hold a Program Implementation Review (PIR).
This  bi-yearly  review  will  cover  the  HRP  management  processes,  and  alignment  of
the HRP technical content, schedule and budget.
Q10. NASA’s ISS National Laboratory report notes that one of the criteria for evalu-
ating  how  long  NASA  will  operate  the  ISS  is  whether  the  ‘‘benefits  to  the  Na-
tion are justifiable.’’ How will NASA determine whether the benefits are justifi-
able?

A10. NASA  will  measure  the  overall  benefits  and  costs  in  economic  and  strategic
terms. Once ISS assembly is complete, that evaluation will be an ongoing effort con-
ducted in an environment open to, and in collaboration with, all domestic and inter-
national stakeholders.
Q11. Could you please describe the status of any discussions between NASA and the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) on NIH’s potential use of the ISS National
Laboratory?

A11. As stated in the NASA/NIH Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed on
September 12, 2007:

The designation as a National Laboratory underscores the significance and impor-
tance that the U.S. places on the scientific potential of the ISS for research in areas
including, but not limited to:

• Basic biological and behavioral mechanisms in the absence of gravity.
• Human physiology and metabolism.
• Spatial orientation and cognition.
• Cell repair processes and tissue regeneration.
• Pathogen infectivity and host immunity.
• Medical countermeasures.
• Health care delivery and health monitoring technologies.

Q11a. What  is  the  commitment  of  the  NIH  and  does  NIH  have  a  budget  to  support

future research to be conducted on the ISS?

A11a. To  date,  the  NIH  has  not  shared  their  specific  implementation  strategies
with NASA.
Q12. NASA’s  report  on  the  ISS  National  Laboratory  states  that  ‘‘In  the  case  of  the
ISS, affordable space transportation services remains the single greatest barrier
to  fielding  a  productive  public  sector  program  in  research.’’  At  what  point
would the cost of space transportation be considered ‘‘affordable’’ enough to en-
courage expanded use of the ISS?

A12. The affordability of space transportation can only be determined in the context
of  the  economic  value  of  the  benefits  as  perceived  by  specific  users,  i.e.,  it  will  be
a  case-by-case  determination.  NASA  is  working  to  ensure  a  better  future  economic
balance in those areas by engaging a large percentage of public and private entities
to  reach  potential  users  with  innovative  ideas,  while,  at  the  same  time,  actively
working to lower the overall costs through the creation of new, low-cost commercial
space launch capabilities.
Q12a. How does NASA plan to handle negotiations on transportation with potential

non-NASA users?

A12a. NASA  is  still  exploring  workable  solutions  to  secure  commercial  services  for
non-NASA users for the delivery of cargo to the ISS. NASA is committed to finding
approaches  that  will  maximize  the  accessibility  of  the  ISS  to  external  users  while
ensuring maximum value to the government.
Q12b. Will NASA provide any technical support on launch services and ISS utiliza-

tion to potential users?

A12b. Yes,  NASA  is  committed  to  ensure  the  successful  execution  of  all  joint  ven-
tures. NASA has already established an approach to assist the efforts of commercial
partners  by  providing  a  network  of  Agency  technical  experts  across  all  discipline
areas. For COTS, NASA has established the COTS Advisory Team (CAT). Addition-
ally,  extensive  NASA  technical  and  facility  resources  can  be  made  available  to  the
commercial partners through reimbursable Space Act Agreements.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. The ISS Independent Safety Task Force recommends that the State Department
should grant immediate relief from the ITAR restrictions no later than summer
of this year to support European Automated Transfer Vehicle operations. Would
you please explain the consequences to NASA and our European partners if such
an exception is not granted? Has NASA sought an exemption from the State De-
partment and if so what is the status? If not, why not?

A1. As  the  overall  integrator  for  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS),  NASA  has
the  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  European  Space  Agency’s  (ESA’s)  Automated
Transfer Vehicle (ATV) is technically and operationally compatible with the ISS and
poses no safety risk. In order to complete this responsibility, NASA and its contrac-
tors are required to conduct technical interchanges to review the ATV design, devel-
opment,  and  testing  in  order  to  verify  that  the  ATV  meets  program  requirements
and  will  work  as  expected.  However,  the  efforts  of  our  contractors  have  been  im-
peded by requirements pertaining to certain export licenses, known as Technical As-
sistance  Agreements  (TAAs).  The  International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations  (ITAR)
requires  that  TAAs  be  signed  by  ESA  (and  other  International  Partners)  before
NASA’s  contractors  can  provide  necessary  technical  assistance  and  services.  Due  to
specific  concerns  about  restrictions  in  the  TAAs,  and  more  general  objections  to
signing TAAs with U.S. contractors in the first place, ESA and other partners have
been  reluctant  to  sign  the  TAAs  necessary  for  the  completion  of  the  tasks  that  are
required  to  ensure  the  safe  and  successful  completion  and  operation  of  the  ISS.
NASA, ESA, and the State Department have been working to resolve the TAA issue.
In addition, due to certain ITAR authorities exclusive to U.S. Government agencies,
NASA can perform tasks that would otherwise be done by its contractors, if the TAA
problem persists. It is not an efficient work-around, but it can be employed, as nec-
essary.

For  several  years,  NASA  has  engaged  with  the  State  Department  regarding  the
potential  development  of  a  tightly-circumscribed  ITAR  exemption  to  allow  NASA  to
authorize  certain  exports  and  technical  assistance  by  contractors  implementing
NASA’s international Government-to-Government agreements. From the NASA per-
spective, this proposal is based upon already-existing authority in the ITAR afforded

73

to  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  in  effecting  Foreign  Military  Sales,  and  in-
cludes comprehensive review and reporting requirements to ensure that NASA con-
tractors’  ITAR-controlled  activities  are  consistent  with  NASA’s  international  agree-
ments,  and  that  the  State  Department  is  apprised  of  those  activities  in  a  timely
manner. The current NASA proposal is compatible with previous guidance provided
by  the  State  Department  as  part  of  prior  efforts  to  work  with  NASA  and  DOD  on
the creation of additional, reasonable discretion under the ITAR in overseeing major
NASA  programs.  The  details  and  overall  feasibility  of  this  proposal  remain  under
discussion between NASA and the State Department.

Although no State Department exemption has been granted, ESA did sign a TAA
with  NASA’s  contractor,  permitting  technical  exchanges  to  proceed.  ESA  did  so  re-
luctantly  in  view  of  the  points  noted  above,  but  this  allowed  both  sides  to  proceed
in  the  near-term  to  ready  ATV  for  its  upcoming  initial  flight.  While  this  resolved
the  immediate  issue,  it  does  not  resolve  the  broader  issues  for  future  cooperation.
Q2. The  ISS  Independent  Safety  Task  Force  recommends  that  the  Administration,
Congress and NASA should support the completion of the current Shuttle mani-
fest  including  the  two  contingency  flights  (STS–131  and  STS–133).  NASA  has
told  us  the  flights  are  in  the  budget  but  they  have  not  been  cleared  through
OMB.  What  factors  determine  whether  the  two  contingency  logistics  flights  will
be  accomplished?  Does  NASA  require  anything  from  Congress  to  allow  the
flights  to  take  place?  What  is  NASA  planning  to  do  with  these  flights  in  the
event of a major delay in completing the ISS assembly missions?

A2. The primary rationale for the two contingency flights is the need to preposition
unpressurized  components  that  are  required  to  ensure  the  viability  of  a  safe  and
operational ISS in the post-Shuttle environment. Other factors include International
Partner commitments to launch modules and large unpressurized elements, and the
Shuttle’s unique capability to launch large unpressurized elements that are not able
to be accommodated on any other current or planned vehicle.

All  the  necessary  Space  Shuttle  Program  and  ISS  funding  and  resources  are  in
place  to  execute  the  contingency  flights.  However,  the  contingency  flights  will  only
be flown if they can be done safely before the end of 2010.

In  the  event  of  a  major  delay  in  the  assembly  of  the  ISS,  NASA  would  discuss
with its International Partners the implications to the ISS configuration and viabil-
ity  based  on  retirement  of  the  Shuttle  in  2010.  NASA  would  also  work  with  its
stakeholders  to  develop  a  strategy  that  will  meet  the  interest  and  policy  objectives
of the U.S.
Q3. How  serious  is  the  risk  that  a  lack  of  critical  spare  parts  could  lead  to  losses
of a critical station function for an extended period, which could ultimately force
NASA to abandon the station?

A3. NASA has developed a plan that uses multiple cargo transportation vehicles to
support  the  ISS.  A  key  element  of  the  plan  is  to  preposition  critical  spares  prior  to
Shuttle  retirement  to  ensure  continued  ISS  system  functionality.  This  provides  an
on-orbit inventory of spares to reduce the risk resulting from launch delays for vis-
iting  vehicles,  which  ensures  that  ISS  viability  is  not  dependent  on  the  success  of
any one vehicle.
Q3a. What is NASA’s contingency planning in the event the COTS is delayed?
A3a. NASA is closely monitoring development of the COTS vehicles and has strate-
gies to react within the appropriate timeframes if development does not proceed ac-
cording to schedule.

The  Shuttle  flight  manifest  calls  for  10  assembly  flights  to  the  ISS  and  one  to
service  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  NASA  also  hopes  to  fly  up  to  two  additional
ISS logistics flights if they are deemed necessary and can be safely flown before the
end of 2010. In addition to prepositioning of spares on orbit with the Space Shuttle,
NASA  is  closely  monitoring  development  of  the  COTS  vehicles  and  is  developing
strategies  to  react  within  the  appropriate  timeframes  if  development  does  not  pro-
ceed according to schedule.
Q4. Would you please give some specific examples of actions NASA has taken to help

workers gain skills that can be transitioned to Exploration Systems?

A4. Expanded  workforce  skills  can  occur  in  a  variety  of  ways  under  Space  Shuttle
contracts.  In  some  cases,  Constellation  tasks  are  added  to  Shuttle  contracts  and
Shuttle  workers  are  able  to  broaden  their  skills  applicability  to  Constellation  work
by performing actual contract tasks.

NASA is providing the tools, training and time for workers to gain experience and
skills on new processes we know we will implement for Orion/Ares. NASA is apply-

74

ing  these  new  processes  required  for  Constellation  into  Shuttle  processing  now,  to
provide  skill  and  experience  that  the  workforce  will  need  to  do  the  future  job  on
Constellation.  This  will  be  real,  hands-on  experience  and  familiarity,  which  will
qualify workers for future work. Examples include:

• The United Space Alliance (USA) Space Programs Operation Contract (SPOC)
workforce  is  being  used  by  Constellation  to  process  the  Ares  I–X  vehicle  for
the first Constellation test flight scheduled for April 2009. The first Constella-
tion flight of Ares will be conducted by the Space Shuttle workforce.
• On  STS–118,  a  single  Solid  Rocket  Booster  (SRB)  was  stacked  at  a  time  to
gather  engineering  information  on  the  Mobile  Launch  Platform  for  Ares  I–X.
The  existing  Space  Shuttle  workforce  performed  this  work  for  the  Constella-
tion Program.
• On  STS–118,  Endeavour  was  powered  up  using  a  new  ‘‘paperless’’  process  as
a  test  of  future  procedures  for  the  Orion  spacecraft.  The  Shuttle  workers
gained  both  a  new  tool  for  the  remaining  Space  Shuttle  missions,  and  were
able to preview and critique a new procedure which is planned to be used for
Constellation.

In  cases  where  additional  training  is  useful,  the  contract  cost  principles  in  the
Federal Acquisition Regulation allow, with certain exceptions, charging contracts for
the  costs  of  training  and  education  that  are  related  to  the  field  in  which  an  em-
ployee is working or may reasonably be expected to work. Depending on the specific
kind  of  training,  the  employee’s  job,  and  company  accounting  practices,  training
costs  might  be  direct  contract  costs  or  overhead  expenses.  It  is  up  to  the  company
to  determine  the  training  needs  for  their  workforce  to  ensure  successful  contract
performance. As with any other contract expense, training costs need to be managed
as part of total contract cost to avoid contract cost overruns.

Specific  examples  of  retraining  and  crossover  job  assignments  to  gain  experience

for Constellation include:

• NASA  Civil  Servants:  For  Fuel  Cell  engineers  at  KSC,  after  analyzing  the
skill sets and positions descriptions, KSC identified several likely positions for
these individuals to transition to within Constellation in support of Cryogenic
Systems or Environment and Crew Life Support Systems (ECLSS). Currently,
the KSC training and development office is in the process of creating training
plans that will identify the precise pathway for these individuals to transition
to one of these other positions.
• Pratt  &  Whitney-Rocketdyne  (PWR)  Personnel:  Space  Shuttle  Main  Engine
employees  across  all  sites  spend  approximately  20  percent  of  their  time  on
other programs. Some examples of areas where this is occurring are combus-
tion  devices  engineering,  manufacturing  engineering,  electrical  engineering,
software engineering and business operations.
• United  Space  Alliance  (USA)  Personnel:  USA  is  beginning  to  retrain  employ-
ees  and  share  staff  between  the  Space  Shuttle  and  Constellation  Programs.
Examples include:

viding matrix support to Constellation.

• Technicians  and  engineers  supporting  Shuttle  Flight  Software  are  pro-
• Technicians  and  engineers  supporting  Shuttle  Ground  Operations  are
providing  matrix  support  to  Constellation  for  shipping  and  receiving  lo-
gistics,  hardware  storage,  tooling,  and  maintenance  of  ground  support
equipment.
• Technicians  and  engineers  that  install  Orbital  Maneuvering  System
(OMS)  and  Main  Engine  tubing,  tanks,  valves,  thrusters  and  engines  on
the Orbiter can be trained to install the same types of components in the
Orion Crew Module and Service Module Propulsion Systems.
• Technicians that currently bend and weld tubing, manufacture and apply
thermal  protection,  solder  electrical  components,  and  fabricate  cables  for
the  Orbiter  and  Solid  Rocket  Booster  can  be  trained  to  perform  these
functions in the assembly of the Orion Crew Module and Service Module.
• Technicians  and  engineers  that  install  electrical  harnesses,  avionics
boxes, cable trays, batteries and instrumentation in the Orbiter and Solid
Rocket  Booster  can  be  trained  to  install  these  components  on  the  Orion
Crew Module and Service Module.
• Technicians and engineers that refurbish and install the Orbiter Landing
Drag  Parachute  and  the  Solid  Rocket  Booster  Recovery  Parachutes  can
be trained to install the Crew Module Recovery System.

• Technicians  and  engineers  that  install  pyrotechnics  on  the  Orbiter  and
Solid  Rocket  Booster  can  be  trained  to  install  these  components  on  the
Orion Crew Module and Service Module.
• Technicians  and  engineers  that  fabricate  and  install  closeout  panels  on
the  Orbiter  and  Solid  Rocket  Booster  can  be  trained  to  install  the
Backshell, Heatshield and access panels on the Crew Module and Service
Module.
• Technicians and engineers that conduct component and system testing for
the  Orbiter,  Solid  Rocket  Booster  and  assembled  Shuttle  Vehicle  can  be
trained to perform component, subsystem, major assembly and integrated
vehicle testing on the Orion Crew Module and Service Module.
• Technicians  and  engineers  that  install  Environmental  Control  and  Life
Support System components on the Orbiter can be trained to install simi-
lar hardware on the Orion Crew Module.

• In  addition,  USA  Flight  Operations  received  NASA  approval  of  a  number  of
initiatives  to  apply  their  skilled  work  force  to  performing  trade  studies  and
evaluations  on  various  aspects  of  the  Constellation  Program,  using  lessons
learned and expertise attained over the past 25 plus years. These teams have
performed,  or  are  currently  performing,  tasks  associated  with  the  following
disciplines outlined below.

• Flight  Design  and  Dynamics—Conducting  trade  studies  for  Navigation
Analysis and Design to assess Constellation integrated performance man-
agement plans, navigation tracking accuracy, navigation standards, space
vehicle  environments,  identifying  existing  models  applicable  for  future
trajectory simulations.
• Spaceflight  Operations—Assessing  existing  NASA  flight  planning  tools
and  techniques  and  identifying  recommended  enhancements  or  modifica-
tions to adapt existing resources for use on Constellation.
• Flight Management—Performing assessments of NASA’s existing produc-
tion  process  reference  networks  for  reuse  on  the  Constellation  program
for  accurately  estimating  component  task  durations  and  required  re-
source profiles.

Q5. What agencies or other groups have expressed interest in using the ISS as a Na-
tional  Laboratory?  What  will  NASA  do  with  the  unused  capacity  and  capabili-
ties of the ISS if other agencies decide not to make significant use of it?

A5. Seven  federal  agencies,  listed  below,  have  actively  engaged  in  discussions  re-
garding  research  opportunities  on  the  ISS  in  its  potential  new  role  as  a  National
Laboratory.  Discussions  on  ISS  National  Laboratory  opportunities  have  been  held
with  representatives  of  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH),  National  Science
Foundation  (NSF),  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA),  National  Institute  of
Standards and Technology (NIST), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S.
Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  and  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD).  As  a  sign  of
progress resulting from these efforts, on September 12, 2007, NASA and NIH signed
a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that provides a framework for NIH to en-
courage  use  of  the  ISS  as  a  National  Laboratory  for  research  in  related  space  and
terrestrial physiology such as bone, muscle and immunology.

NASA  is  also  engaging  the  private  sector  to  solicit  additional  ideas  and  further
opportunities  for  ISS  utilization.  This  is  taking  place  in  the  context  of  the  August
14,  2007,  NASA  announcement  of  Opportunity  for  the  Use  of  the  ISS  by  Non-Gov-
ernment  Entities  for  Research  and  Development  and  Industrial  Processing  Pur-
poses.  Responses  to  this  announcement  were  due  September  28,  2007.  In  the  past,
private  firms  have  demonstrated  interest  and  participated  in  space  research  across
topics as diverse as molecular biology, tissue culturing, bone demineralization, anti-
biotics production, plant genetics, combustion synthesis, and ultra-high vacuum and
microgravity  processing  of  materials.  NASA  also  continues  to  encounter  the  poten-
tial for agreements with private sector firms that involve use of ISS accommodations
and  resources  as  testbeds  for  engineering  research.  Identification  of  new  ventures
resulting from these efforts will maximize ISS utilization once assembly is complete.
Q6. NASA has requested that Congress expand the Enhanced Use Leasing authority
to include all NASA centers. Why is it important to expand NASA’s existing En-
hanced Use Leasing authority, and specifically how will it benefit Shuttle transi-
tion?  Can  you  give  us  some  specific  examples  of  how  expanded  EUL  authority
might ease the workforce transition at each of the Human Space Flight Centers,
including Stennis Space Center and Michoud Assembly Facility?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:35 Jan 24, 2008 Jkt 036737 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\072407\36737 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

76

A6. Expanded  Enhanced  Use  Leasing  (EUL)  authority  is  needed  now  for  all  NASA
Centers  and  is  critically  important  as  NASA  moves  forward  to  retire  the  Space
Shuttle and transition to the new human space flight systems. NASA’s proposed ex-
panded  and  modified  EUL  authority  was  included  in  S.  1745,  the  FY  2008  Com-
merce,  Justice,  Science,  and  Related  Agencies  appropriations  bill,  as  reported,  and
the  Agency  is  seeking  Congressional  support  for  inclusion  of  this  provision  in  the
Conference agreement on the FY 2008 appropriations bill.

With  the  retirement  of  the  Space  Shuttle,  NASA  will  have  even  more  under-uti-
lized  facilities  as  part  of  the  Agency’s  institutional  management  responsibilities.
Space  Shuttle  facilities  alone  have  been  valued  at  approximately  $5.7  billion.  The
proposed  expanded  and  modified  EUL  authority  will  allow  NASA  to  recover  asset
values,  reduce  operating  costs,  improve  facility  conditions,  and  improve  mission  ef-
fectiveness.  Other  federal  agencies,  such  as  the  Department  of  Defense,  have  even
broader authority than the legislative authority proposed by NASA.

NASA has conducted a successful five-year demonstration of EUL at the Ames Re-
search  Center  (ARC)  and  Kennedy  Space  Center  (KSC)  pursuant  to  authority  in-
cluded in the FY 2003 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108–7). Using this au-
thority,  ARC  and  KSC  have  leased  under-utilized  property,  consistent  with  the
Agency  mission,  to  companies  and  universities,  retaining  proceeds  to  cover  the  full
costs  to  NASA  in  connection  with  the  leases  and  using  the  balance  of  funds  for
maintenance, capital revitalization, and improvements to real property assets.

The expanded and modified EUL authority will enable Centers with facilities and
infrastructure associated with the Space Shuttle program and mission to potentially
out-lease  those  facilities  to  others.  Through  a  tenant  base,  the  added  Centers  will
be better able to control their operations and maintenance burden for under-utilized
facilities that have no current program or use. Expansion of NASA’s EUL authority
has the potential to further NASA mission in science as the leased facilities can pro-
vide  a  platform  for  development  of  private  sector  research  and  development  activi-
ties  which  can  further  NASA’s  mission  in  space  related  research.  Having  tenants
on-site can alleviate some of the impact of completion of the Space Shuttle program
on the communities and the personnel associated with that program.

Expanded  EUL  authority  could  benefit  all  NASA  Centers,  however  the  facilities
outlined below could benefit substantially from the ability to enter into EUL agree-
ments.

Kennedy Space Center (KSC): KSC is planning for a substantial facility and work-
force  realignment  in  the  transition  era  from  Space  Shuttle  to  Constellation,  and  is
investigating  a  number  of  new  potential  EUL  partnerships.  KSC  can  use  EUL  to
grow the private sector’s role in the Nation’s civil space activities and expand KSC’s
institutional user base to more fully utilize existing spaceport assets. Future Poten-
tial  Enhanced  Use  Lease  Options  under  Consideration  by  KSC  include  an  ‘‘Explo-
ration  Park’’  the  320-acre  site  outside  the  spaceport’s  controlled  access  area;  Public
and  Commercial  Space  Access  at  the  Shuttle  Landing  Facility  (SLF);  a  Public  Out-
reach Venue for tourism growth and demand for hotel/conference facilities in region;
and an Academic and Commercial Test Facility by providing the site for a test facil-
ity to support clean energy development (currently there is no such U.S.-based facil-
ity).

Marshall Space Flight Center—Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF): MAF will man-
ufacture the Boeing Ares I Upper Stage, Ares V Boost Stage, and Ares Earth Depar-
ture Stage, so there could be a significant incentive for private entities to locate on
the  site  when  EUL  authority  is  available.  Commercial  use  of  the  space,  by  tier  2,
3, or 4 Space program suppliers is expected. The proximity of suppliers can increase
the  suppliers’  understanding  of  NASA  program  requirements  and  ease  product  de-
livery,  expanding  the  skill  base  and  workforce  pool  needed  to  execute  NASA’s  next
generation of vehicles. EUL authority would allow MAF to reduce its facilities over-
head  burden  and  to  develop  revenue  streams  for  sustaining  its  facilities  and  infra-
structure.  MAF  currently  hosts  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  and  the  U.S.  Department  of
Agriculture  as  tenants  on  the  site.  MAF  was  one  of  the  few  sites  in  that  part  of
Louisiana that was not inundated by the Hurricane Katrina storm surge and flood-
ing.  EUL  authority  would  allow  MAF  to  expand  the  existing  tenant  base  on  the
green  space  within  the  836  acres  to  accelerate  hurricane  recovery  in  Louisiana.
NASA  MAF  has  already  met  with  other  Federal  entities,  such  as  the  Department
of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory to discuss their business model for devel-
oping  their  science  and  technology  park.  MAF  has  specific  unusual  capabilities
which  can  be  utilized  or  expanded  by  EUL  partners.  These  capabilities  include  ex-
tensive  infrastructure  for  design,  manufacturing,  and  testing  of  extremely  large
aerospace structures; their transportation and handling including a deepwater port;
and  the  specialized  environmental  permits,  wastewater  treatment  capability,  and
compliance management for large launch vehicle manufacturing. MAF already hosts

the National Center for Advanced Manufacturing (NCAM), a federal, State, and uni-
versity  sponsored  partnership.  The  NCAM  currently  includes  the  friction  stir  weld
(FSW)  universal  weld  system,  environmentally  enclosed  state-of-the-art  advanced
fiber  placement  machines,  and  advanced  Non-Destructive  Evaluation  and  high
speed machining systems.

Stennis Space Center (SSC): The Army, under the BRAC 2005, will soon transfer
the  Mississippi  Army  Ammunition  Plant  to  SSC,  offering  significant  EUL  potential
with  the  transfer  of  1.5  million  square  feet  of  plant  space  and  4,500  acres  of  land.
Some of the under-utilized property can be available for out-leasing. These potential
leases could help bring jobs and growth to an area devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
Glenn  Research  Center  (GRC):  GRC  has  under-utilized  land  outside  the  campus
gates  that  has  a  high  potential  for  out-leasing  due  to  its  proximity  to  the  airport,
interstate  highways,  and  to  GRC.  Additionally,  Plum  Brook  Station  has  an  under-
utilized water intake capacity (Rye Beach) from Lake Erie in which the surrounding
communities and farms have expressed interest. Other parts of Plum Brook Station
may also be available for out-leasing.

Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  (GSFC):  GSFC  has  identified  several  EUL  can-
didates,  including  a  Science  Exploration  and  Education  Center,  to  provide  public
knowledge  and  engagement  related  to  Earth  and  Space  Science  and  buildings  and
land where collocation of scientific research or technology partners could strengthen
NASA’s  ability  to  attract  and  retain  talent  and  foster  collaboration  with  industry
and academia. The Wallops Flight Facility has several aircraft facilities where EUL
authority  could  maximize  the  economic  benefit  and  flexibility  to  pursue  additional
commercial opportunities to sustain facility infrastructure and promote economic de-
velopment on the Eastern Shore.

Langley Research Center (LaRC): As part of its Master Plan for New Town, LaRC
has  identified  up  to  400  acres  in  the  northern  portion  of  the  Center  for  leasing  or
collaborative use opportunities with outside entities, which could be a candidate for
use of EUL authority.
Q7. The  current  Shuttle  flight  rate  between  now  and  2010  is  optimistic.  What  is
NASA’s contingency plan if the actual Shuttle flight rate turns out to be insuffi-
cient  to  complete  all  the  planned  ISS  assembly  and  logistics  flights  by  the  end
of  2010?  How  would  a  major  delay  impact  on  ISS  utilization  and  operations?
A7. There is sufficient schedule margin in 2010 such that, if a flight had to slip out
of 2008 or 2009, it could still be flown before the end of 2010. If there is an unfore-
seen event that leads to insufficient schedule margin remaining in which to conduct
any  planned  missions,  NASA  will  discuss  the  impacts  with  the  International  Part-
ners and develop a revised transportation plan.

NASA  has  no  plans  to  fly  the  Shuttle  after  2010,  and  indeed  the  Shuttle  cannot

plans support ISS utilization and operations.

Responses  by  Tommy  W.  Holloway,  Chairman,  ISS  Independent  Safety  Task  Force

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Your testimony refers to the need for ‘‘sufficient support from the Administration
and Congress. . .to ensure that the resources are provided and the safety-critical
aspects of the ISS assembly and operations are enabled and maintained.’’

Q1a. Did  the  task  force  comment  on  whether  the  current  level  of  resources  is  suffi-

cient or not?

A1a. With  the  exception  of  funding  for  logistics  transportation  after  Shuttle  retire-
ment,  the  Task  Force  believes  the  current  level  of  funding  for  the  ISS  is  adequate.
Q1b. What level of resources would be considered sufficient?
A1b. The  ISS  budget  should  be  augmented  to  support  the  logistics  transportation
requirements. Care should be taken in future core budget (budget for other than lo-
gistics  transportation)  reductions  to  avoid  deletion  of  critical  engineering  skills  to
maintain  the  current  level  of  attention  to  safety-critical  aspects  of  ISS  operations.
Q1c. What,  if  any,  are  the  safety  and  other  implications  to  the  ISS  if  additional  re-

sources are not found for the program?

A1c. The  major  safety  implications  are  the  loss  of  the  skills  to  detect  and  correct
emerging safety issues before they become a problem. It is critical that critical skills
be  maintained  in  all  disciplines  and  experienced  and  highly  skilled  managers  be
maintained to avoid safety implications becoming a reality.
Q2. If NASA had to return the ISS crew to Earth for whatever reason, could the ISS

survive in an un-crewed mode, and if so, for how long?

A2. In  the  opinion  of  the  Task  Force  Chairman,  the  ISS  survival  in  a  un-crewed
mode  depends  on  the  reason  the  ISS  was  un-crewed  and  the  type  and  number  of
future  failures.  The  Mission  Control  Center  (MCC)  can  operate  the  ISS  without  a
crew  but,  of  course,  the  MCC  cannot  perform  maintenance  and  repair  tasks  to  re-
pair  or  replace  failed  components.  For  some  failures  the  ISS  could  not  survive  in
the un-crewed mode and for many others the ISS could survive for months and per-
haps years depending on future failures.
Q3. You  testified  that  ‘‘I  think  it  would  be  unlikely  that  the  COTS  will  be  able  to
provide  a  substantial  part  of  the  logistics  program  in  the  most  critical  period
following  the  retirement  of  the  Shuttle  program.’’  What  actions  do  you  believe
NASA  should  take  to  ensure  a  robust  logistics  supply  capability  for  the  ISS  in
the  post-Shuttle  period?  What  should  NASA  be  doing  to  ensure  a  crew  transfer
and crew rescue capability for U.S. astronauts after 2010?

A3. Currently there are only three systems operating or being developed that could
provide post-Shuttle logistics support. They are:

a. The Shuttle
b. COTS
c. ISS  partner  logistics  vehicles  (Russian  Progress,  ESA  ATV  and  Japanese

HTV

The  Task  Force  made  the  following  recommendation  relative  to  the  post-Shuttle
logistics transportation (Final Report of the International Space Station Independent
Safety Task Force, page 59):

5.2.1  The  ISS  Program  should  develop  a  fully  integrated  logistics  support  plan
with  off  and  on  ramps  of  available  and  planned  capability  for  the  logistics  support
for  the  Assembly  Complete/six  crew  member/post-Shuttle  era.  The  plan  should  in-
clude projected budget requirements for logistics support.

a. The Program should not be required to commit the ISS to an unproven logis-
tics support system such as COTS. If a proven logistics support system is not
available,  the  Program  should  commit  to  the  future  capability  that  is  deter-
mined  to  have  the  highest  chance  of  success  until  emerging  capabilities  are
proven.  The  Administration  and  the  Congress  should  support  this  position.
b. To  ensure  that  it  is  not  forced  into  dependency  on  an  unproven  capability,
the  Program  should  procure  additional  spare  proven  capability  to  assure  a

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:35 Jan 24, 2008 Jkt 036737 PO 00000 Frm 00082 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\072407\36737 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

79

smooth  transition  to  unproven  capabilities  later  and  to  minimize  transition
through down periods on logistics delivery systems.

5.2.2  The  ISS  Program  should  develop  an  option  that  ensures  that  the  two  re-
maining  exterior  logistics  flights  are  given  the  highest  priority  for  flight,  in  front
of  Node  3  if  necessary,  to  avoid  exacerbating  a  problem  should  all  planned  Shuttle
flights not be completed (ref. Shuttle Manifest Considerations).

5.2.3 NASA should develop roles, responsibilities, and critical review mechanisms
for  COTS  and  other  future  non-NASA  systems  that  will  fully  support  ISS  require-
ments.  The  ISS  Program  should  be  responsible  for  managing  and  conducting  the
NASA review and approval of hazard analyses and participating in the required de-
sign reviews to ensure safety requirements are being meet.

5.2.4  In  early  2009,  NASA  should  seek  legislation  for  an  extension  of  the  2005

amendment to the Iran Non-Proliferation Amendments Act.

This  means  procure  enough  proven  capability  to  support  logistics  until  the  sys-
tems  under  development  is  proven.  Since  production  and  therefore  procurement  of
flight  systems  will  take  two  to  three  years,  careful  phasing  of  procurement  of  new
systems  with  backup  capability  from  proven  systems  should  be  employed.  Prac-
tically, this means buy enough Russian Progresses to ensure adequate ISS logistics
transportation  until  the  next  system  is  operational.  Then  sequence  the  emerging
systems based on the capability required and procurement considerations.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. The ISS Independent Safety Task Force was very concerned about the adequacy
of  the  ISS’s  post-Shuttle  logistics  support.  According  to  NASA,  there  is  a  $300
million  shortfall  in  the  ISS-Crew-Cargo  Services  budget  based  on  current  esti-
mates,  with  an  additional  $600  million  shortfall  held  as  a  lien  against  the  Ex-
ploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  budget.  What  critical  decision  milestones
should Congress and NASA focus on as COTS is being developed? Can you rec-
ommend  any  early  indicators  that  Congress  and  NASA  might  use  to  predict
whether COTS is progressing as advertised?

A1. The  Task  Force  Chairman  cannot  recommend  any  reliable  early  indicators  to
predict  whether  COTS  is  progressing  as  advertised.  It  is  not  possible  to  make  an
early  determination  that  a  new  major  development  program  with  daunting  crew
safety requirements is going to meet technical requirements and be on schedule. As
reported in the ‘‘Final Report of the International Space Station Independent Safety
Task Force,’’ (page 58) the following summarizes the NASA safety requirements for
approaching and being attached to the ISS:

The  IISTF  considers  the  design  and  development  of  a  new  support  vehicle  and
logistical system to dock with the ISS to be a formable technical challenge. The sig-
nificant  safety  requirements  to  be  able  to  safely  rendezvous  and  berth  or  dock  to
the ISS include:

causing a catastrophic ISS hazard).

capability for low-level redundancy management.

• the system must be two failure tolerant (i.e., can sustain two failures without
• the system must have on-board fault detection, isolation, and reconfiguration
• the system must have vehicle self-monitoring of critical capabilities and func-
tions  and  auto-corrective  actions,  including  hold,  retreat,  or  escape  maneu-
vers.
• the vehicle must have an independent collision avoidance maneuver function.
• the  system  must  support  ISS  crew  and  ground  monitoring  and  abort  capa-
• the  flight  system  must  have  robustness  against  failed  capture  capabilities  (if
the vehicle is captured by the RMS) or failed docking (if the vehicle is actively
docked to the ISS) while ensuring a safe recovery or separation from the ISS.
Considering  the  above,  it  is  critical  that  the  ISS  Program  performs  a  series  of
safety reviews and approves Hazard Reports to ensure that all of the safety require-
ments are adequately implemented. The ISS Program must also participate in major
design  reviews  to  ensure  that  the  design  is  implementing  the  necessary  safety  re-
quirements.

bility.

It  is  the  Task  Force  Chairman’s  opinion  that  early  in  a  development  program  it
is  very  difficult  to  determine  if  a  program  such  as  COTS  will  successfully  meet  its
technical requirements and stay on schedule. Monitoring by personnel who are expe-

80

rienced  in  development  programs  and  are  accountable  for  safety  requirements  can
determine  that  a  program  is  failing  to  meet  technical  requirements  or  is  behind  on
its  schedule;  but,  conversely,  it  is  not  possible  to  judge  that  the  program  will  meet
future technical and schedule expectations. As the program progresses through Pre-
liminary Design Review, Critical Design Review (CDR), and a flight certification re-
view  the  ability  to  determine  technical  readiness  and  schedule  integrity  increases.
The final test is a flight test program to demonstrate the requirements are met and
the system performs as advertised.

It  is  the  opinion  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Task  Force  that  procurement  commit-
ments for an emerging ISS logistics transportation system should not be made until
the system is proven by flight test or, if an emerging capability is mandatory earlier
than that schedule would provide, no earlier than CDR.

It  is  also  the  opinion  of  the  task  force  Chairman  that  the  most  difficult  develop-
ment challenge will be the development of the spacecraft that rendezvous and docks
with the ISS rather than the launch rocket.

The  difficulties  and  schedule  delays  that  ESA  has  had  in  developing  the  Auto-
mated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) should be a measure of the technical challenge. There
are  no  reasons  to  expect  others  will  be  more  successful  in  the  foreseeable  future.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  G.  Paul  Neitzel,  Professor  of  Fluid  Mechanics,  Georgia  Institute  of

Technology

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. You testified that NASA’s plans for ISS utilization are ‘‘shortsighted and incon-
sistent with the types of systems that will best allow us to return to the Moon
between  2015,  and  2020,  and  prepare  for  more  ambitious  systems.’’  Could  you
please  discuss  specific  examples  of  the  systems  that  are  needed  and  for  which
R&D is not currently included in NASA’s ISS utilization plans?

A1. Although  the  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  does  not  specifically  call
for a manned mission to Mars, it seems ‘‘shortsighted’’ to be developing new systems
to take us to the Moon that will not employ the best possible solutions to long-stand-
ing  needs,  such  as  management  of  liquids  (propellants,  cooling  agents,  waste,  etc.,
),  heat  rejection,  fire  detection/suppression,  and  operation  of  life-support  systems.  I
have  characterized  in  my  original  written  testimony  the  challenges  of  designing
fluid systems capable of operating on the lunar or Martian surface as ‘‘routine,’’ but
we  must  recognize  that  long-duration  stays  aboard  either  surface  will  require  the
development  of  new  technologies  for  the  efficient  utilization  of  available  resources
that  cannot  be  fully  validated  prior  to  their  implementation.  Many  of  the  systems
that  are  likely  to  be  necessary  will  involve  the  handling  of  multi-phase  flows  (e.g.,
of bubbly liquids or dusty gases) that can operate differently in a partial-gravity en-
vironment.  A  substantial  investment  in  research  on  the  behavior  of  fluid  systems
in zero-to-partial gravity is required so that the engineering of any eventually need-
ed technologies is well-grounded scientifically to ensure highest performance and re-
liability.

The  principal  limitation  for  any  launch  vehicle  is  up-mass.  A  500-  to  1000-day
manned  mission  to  Mars  with  limited  re-supply  requires  the  development  of  mass-
efficient systems to satisfy these needs to permit maximum transport of food, water
and  materials  and  supplies  to  be  used  on  the  planetary  surface.  Missions  to  the
Moon that aim to establish laboratories and habitats will likewise require the trans-
port of materials and supplies to enable effective lunar research, exploration, in situ
resource  utilization,  and  habitat  construction.  These  new,  mass-efficient  systems
will  need  to  be  dual-use,  i.e.,  capable  of  functioning  both  in  a  reduced-gravity  (1/
6  lunar  and  3/8  Martian)  environment  as  well  as  in  the  microgravity  environment
experienced during the journey itself. Existing systems developed for the Shuttle era
are more than a quarter-century old and do not incorporate results of the incredible
amount of research and development done over the last 25 years.

NASA’s  ISS  utilization  plan  indeed  includes  projects  that  will  evaluate  systems
chosen  as  candidates  for  addressing  some  of  the  issues  raised  above.  However,
NASA  has  decided  to  focus  on  projects  considered  to  be  at  mid-to-high  Technology
Readiness  Levels  (TRL),  i.e.,  ready  for  implementation.  In  some  instances,  a  single
system  is  being  investigated  as  a  potential  solution  to  a  given  problem.  This  elimi-
nates  considerations  of  trade-offs  between  candidate  systems  and  between  systems
designed to accomplish other tasks, reducing the likelihood of arriving at an optimal
configuration.  Given  that  the  earliest  possible  launch  date  is  nearly  eight  years
away,  does  it  make  sense  to  be  selecting  new  solutions  to  long-standing  issues  at
such  an  early  date,  particularly  in  light  of  the  rapid  technological  progress  being
made in such areas as micro- and nano-scale systems?
Q2. In  your  testimony,  you  evaluate  NASA’s  planned  ISS  research  and  state  that
‘‘The  small  number  of  projects  being  investigated,  although  relevant  to  explo-
ration,  is  inconsistent  with  the  conduct  of  a  robust,  safe  exploration  program
that  will  send  astronauts  to  the  Moon  no  later  than  2015.’’  Could  you  please
elaborate on why you think the number of research investigations is inconsistent
with the conduct of a robust and safe exploration program?

A2. As  mentioned  in  response  to  the  first  question  above,  NASA  has  seemingly  re-
stricted  its  attention  to  focus  on  a  very  small  number  of  systems  at  mid-to-high
TRLs for more efficiently solving some of the long-standing problems associated with
space  travel.  The  rapid  pace  of  scientific  and  technological  development  within  the
last  decade  or  so,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  computational  capability  and  micro-
and  nano-scale  systems  suggests  that  there  are  several  avenues  that  could  be  ex-
plored  to  ensure  that  the  best  and  most  reliable  solutions  (and  in  some  cases  the
only  solutions)  to  these  problems  are  found.  The  ISS  is  the  only  test  bed  available
for the conduct of long-duration experimentation under true microgravity conditions.

Additionally,  for  research  at  small  length  scales,  terrestrial  experiments,  numerical
simulation and theory can go a long way in narrowing down candidates to the sub-
set  likely  to  hold  the  most  promise  for  exploration  applications  and,  therefore,  wor-
thy of further testing/validation aboard the ISS.
Q2a. What should be done to correct the situation?
A2a. The  tremendous  expertise  available  within  the  external  (to  NASA)  research
community  should  be  drawn  upon  to  seek  the  best,  most  reliable  solutions  to  the
aforementioned problems. NASA should immediately reinstitute a vigorous external
research program in both fundamental and applied science so that the required sys-
tems can be envisioned and tested in a timely manner for ultimate implementation
aboard the next generation of space flight vehicles.
Q3. Could  you  please  describe,  in  specific  terms,  the  type  of  logistics  support  that

might be needed for meaningful research on the ISS?

A3. The  ISS  U.S.  laboratory  was  intended  to  simplify  access  by  experimenters  to
space.  Some  hardware,  designated  as  ‘‘facility  class,’’  was  designed  to  accommodate
roughly  80  person  of  the  experiments  envisioned  to  be  conducted  within  their  re-
spective disciplines. One example of this is the Fluids and Combustion Facility con-
sisting  of  the  Fluids  Integrated  Rack  and  the  Combustion  Integrated  Rack.  These
facilities  provide  power,  standard  instrumentation,  video  capability,  etc.,  necessary
to  support  many  of  the  common  experimental  tasks,  while  also  providing  the  outer
levels of containment required for safety. Thus, the experiment-specific hardware to
be  developed  for  each  investigation  is  simplified,  streamlining  the  path  to  flight.  It
is  important  to  the  conduct  of  ‘‘meaningful  research’’  that  these  facilities  be  trans-
ported to and properly integrated with the ISS.

A  critical  component  limiting  meaningful  research  is  crew  time.  At  its  present
size,  a  permanent  crew  of  three  is  able  to  do  little  more  than  keep  the  ISS  flying
and tend to ‘‘housekeeping’’ tasks. Those ISS research investigations that have been
conducted  to-date  have  been  chosen  because  of  their  minimal  resource  (in  terms  of
both  hardware  and  crew)  requirements.  Research  necessary  for  the  development  of
new,  innovative  systems  to  permit  lunar  and  Martian  exploration  will  require  ex-
periments  that  are  more  complex  than  those  currently  possible.  According  to  Mr.
Gerstenmaier’s written testimony, NASA plans to increase crew size to six members
in  2009.  This  will  permit  more  crew-intensive  research  to  be  conducted,  such  as
those  investigations  requiring  the  use  of  facility-class  hardware  mentioned  in  the
previous  paragraph.  In  addition  to  crew  time,  ISS  Experiments  require  significant
ground  support,  including  training  astronauts  to  conduct  experiments  and  provi-
sions for in-flight communication between investigators and astronauts. These costs
must be properly funded, in addition to the more direct research costs.
Q4. Mr.  Gerstenmaier’s  testimony  notes  that  ‘‘The  ISS  is  critically  important  to  the
success  of  future  long-duration  missions. . .because  it  is  the  only  facility  that
combines  the  ambient  environment  and  research  capabilities  needed  to  under-
stand  the  extent  of  these  risks  [associated  with  long  duration  human  explo-
ration]  with  the  ability  to  develop  and  test  appropriate  countermeasures.’’
Could you please comment on NASA’s plans to address these risks?

A4. It is my understanding that NASA has a plan to use the ISS until roughly 2019
as  a  platform  for  research  on  risks  to  health  associated  with  long-duration  human
exploration  and  the  development  of  appropriate  countermeasures.  This  seems  to  be
a prudent course of action.
Q5. The ISS safety task force found that systems design, testing, and procedures and
mitigation approaches to respond to potential uncontrolled fire or toxic spills, for
example,  were  adequate.  Based  on  your  expertise,  are  risks  associated  with  un-
controlled  fire  or  the  behavior  of  toxic  spills  in  microgravity  well  understood?
If  not,  what  further  aspects  of  potential  uncontrolled  fire  or  toxic  spills  need  to
be  understood  to  ensure  robust  mitigation  approaches  and  response  procedures?
A5. It  is  not  clear  that  we  are  adequately  prepared  to  handle  major  incidents  such
as  an  uncontrolled  fire  or  toxic  spill  in  a  microgravity  environment.  NASA’s  prin-
cipal  approach  to  fire  safety  has  been  to  focus  on  prevention.  However,  as  ISS  sys-
tems age and the amount of material on-orbit grows, the likelihood of a fire incident
increases;  the  same  holds  true  for  toxic  spills.  We  know  that  fires  burn  and  spread
differently  in  microgravity  and  the  transport  and  effectiveness  of  suppressants  is
also  affected  by  the  absence  of  body  force.  Liquid  and  solid  toxic  spills  likewise  be-
have differently in microgravity than in a gravitational environment and differently
from one another.

Surprisingly, despite the known toxicity of certain flammable materials that must
be used on spacecraft and despite the risk of fire, the cleanup of spacecraft following
a  fire  is  currently  not  a  NASA  priority,  according  to  the  2000  National  Research
Council report, Microgravity Research in Support of Technologies for the Human Ex-
ploration  and  Development  of  Space  and  Planetary  Bodies.  Hazard-mitigation  and
cleanup  strategies  need  to  account  for  the  differences  in  dispersal  and  deposition
characteristics  for  particles  and  liquid  droplets  in  microgravity.  During  the  Shuttle
era,  the  plan,  in  the  event  of  such  an  accident,  was  to  refurbish  the  spacecraft  fol-
lowing  its  return  to  Earth,  something  not  possible  with  the  ISS  or  a  lunar  habitat
and not practical for a spacecraft traveling to Mars.

To ensure the safest possible spacecraft environment, NASA must be prepared to
deal with accidents such as uncontrolled fire and toxic spills. A well-coordinated pro-
gram  of  ground-based  research  and  microgravity  experiments  should  be  in  place  to
address these issues, but none exists, at least within the external research commu-
nity.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. What  specifically  should  NASA  do  within  their  current  budget  to  ensure  the

most productive utilization of the ISS after the Shuttle is retired?

A1. Presently,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  ISS  will  be  utilized  productively  fol-
lowing  he  retirement  of  the  Shuttle  in  2010.  The  ISS  National  Laboratory  Plan  in-
tends  to  rely  upon  other  federal  agencies  and  commercial  ventures  to  make  use  of
this  facility,  bearing  the  significant  transportation  costs  from  their  own  budgets.
Transportation to and from the ISS is to be provided by COTS being developed pres-
ently.  Thus,  there  are  many  things  that  have  to  come  together  in  order  for  the
present ISS National Laboratory Plan to be viable.

It  is,  in  my  opinion,  unlikely  that  sufficient  interest  on  the  part  of  other  federal
agencies  and  commercial  ventures  will  arise  to  fully  utilize  the  research  facilities
of  the  ISS  at  assembly  complete.  On  the  other  hand,  this  platform  provides  a  re-
search capability that is central to the solution of problems associated with activities
to  be  pursued  under  the  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  In  addition,  the
ISS is the only facility capable of supporting non-exploration research requiring ac-
cess  to  long-duration  microgravity.  NASA  needs  to  pursue  aggressively  lines  of  in-
vestigation of both fundamental and applied natures and both exploration and non-
exploration relevance that are suitable for study aboard the ISS and that would ben-
efit  from  its  unique  microgravity  environment.  The  former  NASA  external  research
community  was  effectively  abolished  and  there  are  few  flight  experiments  ‘‘waiting
in  the  wings.’’  For  a  relatively  modest  investment  by  NASA  from  its  current  budg-
et—say  $70–$100M  per  year—a  reasonably  healthy  research  program  (of  roughly
half  the  size  it  was  immediately  prior  to  its  cancellation)  could  be  restarted  and
maintained,  ensuring  the  productive  utilization  of  this  significant  facility  in  the
post-Shuttle era.
Q2. In your testimony, you outline the risks associated with the reduced levels of re-
search  funding,  and  note  that  NASA  sometimes  regards  research  as  a  spigot
that  can  be  turned  off  and  on  at  will.  Given  the  reductions  and  the  loss  of  re-
searchers  in  the  pipeline  that  has  already  taken  place,  what  can  NASA  do  now
to  ensure  an  appropriate  level  of  exploration-related  research  is  available  when
needed in the 2015 timeframe?

A2. NASA  needs  to  reinvest  immediately  in  its  external  research  program  with  a
commitment  to  funding  such  research  out  to  the  expected  lifetime  of  the  ISS.  The
importance of advanced training at the graduate level for supplying future research-
ers in the microgravity life and physical sciences central to NASA’s mission and the
motivation  provided  by  space-based  research  for  American  youth  to  pursue  careers
in  the  STEM  disciplines  cannot  be  overstated.  With  a  long-term  commitment  of  re-
search  support  from  NASA,  some  of  those  principal  investigators  from  NASA’s
former  external  research  community  would  likely  be  willing  to  return  to  the  pro-
gram to enable their research to be completed and new investigators would be stim-
ulated  to  think  about  microgravity-related  problems.  The  first  stage  of  exploration-
related research should be oriented to improving our depth of understanding of fluid
and combustion phenomena and material handling in microgravity, fundamental re-
search that could be underway now in ground-based facilities if NASA were funding
it.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Cristina T. Chaplain, Director, Acquisition and Sourcing Management,

Government Accountability Office

Question submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Your  testimony  refers  to  risks  related  to  the  newness  of  both  NASA’s  relation-
ships  with  the  Commercial  Orbital  Transportation  System  (COTS)  suppliers
and the COTS vehicles being developed. What contingencies do you think NASA
should consider given these risks?

A1. Current  contingency  plans  available  to  NASA  in  the  event  that  the  COTS  pro-
gram does not meet cost, schedule and performance thresholds are limited and prob-
lematic at best. NASA has focused primarily on one major contingency to COTS and
that is the use of international partner vehicles—those existing and those currently
in  development—if  COTS  vehicles  are  not  ready  at  the  time  of  Shuttle  retirement.
NASA has stated its preference for the use of COTS, but acknowledges that reliance
on  partners  may  be  necessary.  However,  NASA  must  acknowledge  several  con-
straints  associated  with  reliance  on  international  partners.  First,  all  of  the  inter-
national  partner  vehicles—Russian,  European  and  Japanese—have  payload  limita-
tions and only one can carry crew. Second, the new European and Japanese vehicles
are  still  under  development.  The  European  vehicle  is  slated  to  make  its  first  test
launch  in  early  2008  and  the  Japanese  vehicle  is  scheduled  for  its  first  operational
flight in 2009. These tests must go smoothly in order for NASA to be able to transi-
tion  to  use  of  these  vehicles  at  the  time  when  the  Shuttle  is  retired.  Third,  NASA
may  face  restriction  in  its  use  of  Russian  vehicles  because  of  the  expiration  at  the
end  of  2011  of  an  exception  under  the  Iran,  North  Korea,  and  Syria  Non-Prolifera-
tion  Act.  Finally,  NASA  may  need  to  resolve  potential  export  controls  challenges  in
working  with  the  international  partners  to  ensure  inter-operability  with  the  Inter-
national Space Station before those vehicles can begin logistics operations.

A  NASA  official  stated  publicly  that  the  agency  could  also  consider  additional
Shuttle  flights  past  the  currently  set  2010  retirement  date.  While  this  may  be  an
additional contingency plan to COTS, there are challenges associated with extending
the Shuttle flights. First, if NASA has already begun to shutdown both the suppliers
and  workforce  necessary  for  Shuttle  operations  by  the  time  it  makes  the  decision
to  extend  the  Shuttle  retirement  date,  the  agency  will  have  to  overcome  shortfalls
in  both  workforce  and  equipment  as  a  result  of  those  closures.  Our  previous  work
has  noted  that  production  restarts  when  some  suppliers  are  let  go  but  found  to  be
needed  later,  can  lead  to  funding  gaps.  Supplier  viability  presents  another  chal-
lenge. Over the years, the Shuttle Program has experienced many instances of sup-
pliers  dropping  off  unpredictably,  making  supply  chain  management  more  difficult
and costly.

NASA also faces the prospect of continuing to experience delays because of weath-
er and launch debris as it has with previous missions. As recently as the Endeavor,
NASA stated it has had design problems that plague the program and require unan-
ticipated additional resources, which can potentially impact the current flight sched-
ule.

Finally, according to NASA, adding Shuttle flights will increase the costs of Shut-
tle  operations.  NASA  officials  said  that  they  plan  to  rely  on  funding  from  the  Con-
stellation program in order to fund additional Shuttle flights after 2010. By pushing
the retirement of the Shuttle back, NASA would again have to reassess its cost esti-
mates  and  funding  options  for  COTS  and  the  Constellation  program.  Our  previous
work  has  found  that  developing  cost  estimates  is  a  complex  task  for  a  transition  of
this  magnitude.  Although  NASA  has  identified  funding  needs  through  fiscal  year
2010  for  transition  activities  relating  to  the  retirement  of  the  Shuttle  and  the
ramping up of the Constellation program, those total costs are currently being devel-
oped. Additionally, many transition and retirement activities will occur after the re-
tirement date, and according to NASA officials, such efforts could last through 2020.
Our  previous  work  has  also  noted  that  NASA  does  not  yet  know  the  extent  of  the
Shuttle  Program’s  environmental  liabilities.  Paying  for  such  liabilities  later  may
complicate NASA’s future fiscal landscape, especially when there will be other com-
peting  demands,  such  as  Constellation’s  crew  exploration  vehicle,  the  crew  launch
vehicle, and other new exploration activities.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. The ISS Independent Safety Task Force was very concerned about the adequacy
of  the  ISS’s  post-Shuttle  logistics  support.  According  to  NASA,  there  is  a  $300
million  shortfall  in  the  ISS  Crew-Cargo  Services  budget  based  on  current  esti-
mates,  with  an  additional  $600  million  shortfall  held  as  a  lien  against  the  Ex-
ploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  budget.  What  critical  decision  milestones
should Congress and NASA focus on as COTS is being developed? Can you rec-
ommend  any  early  indicators  that  Congress  and  NASA  might  use  to  predict
whether COTS is progressing as advertised?

A1. NASA  is  relying  on  the  availability  of  COTS  vehicles  after  retiring  the  Shuttle
in  2010  to  provide  logistics  support  and  re-supply  to  the  ISS.  The  COTS  services
currently  under  development  for  demonstration  to  NASA  have  received  funding  for
cargo services only. Crew capabilities are an option written into the agreements be-
tween  NASA  and  its  primary  COTS  developers  that  will  require  NASA  to  provide
further funding at a later date.

GAO has performed extensive work in determining important milestones that in-
dicate progress for development of new systems. Currently, one of NASA’s COTS de-
velopers  is  entering  Critical  Design  Review,  which  is  the  final  review  of  system
drawings  before  fabrication  of  their  system.1 For  this  milestone,  GAO  has  found
that completing 90 percent of drawings portends successful fabrication. In addition,
all  technologies  should  have  been  fully  matured  and  tested  in  a  relevant  environ-
ment. Each critical component should also exhibit ‘‘form, fit and function’’ character-
istics at this point. Congress should closely consider these indicators of how well the
proposed  vehicles  meet  requirements  and  what  the  delivery  time  frames  will  actu-
ally be. If the technologies needed to meet requirements are not mature, design and
production maturity will be delayed. Critical Design Review can provide a clear and
realistic indication of the schedule for delivery of the capability.

While  the  COTS  vehicles  are  in  some  measure  based  on  existing  systems,  they
are  nonetheless  being  developed  for  new  purposes.  The  four  capabilities—unpres-
surized  cargo  delivery,  pressurized  cargo  delivery,  pressurized  cargo  delivery,  and
return  and  crew  transport—are  due  to  be  delivered  in  a  staggered  schedule,  rather
than  all  on  a  single  date.  As  such,  testing  events  will  also  be  very  important  to  in-
forming  both  NASA  and  the  Congress  on  the  progress  of  the  COTS  vehicles.  If  a
vehicle fails a test, the program could face schedule delays. Furthermore, the COTS
vehicle  tests  require  berthing  with  the  ISS.  A  NASA  deputy  program  manager  for
the  ISS  stated  that  the  new  European  vehicle  will  be  ready  for  test  launch  to  the
ISS shortly, but because of ISS’s scheduling windows, that vehicle cannot make that
test flight until late January 2008. Similar constraints will be put upon COTS vehi-
cle tests, so the success of those tests will be critical to NASA’s assessment of when
those capabilities will be available.

1 The  second  primary  COTS  developer  has  not  completed  the  previous  phase,  as  described  in
the agreement with NASA, which required the company to secure sufficient funding for the de-
velopment  program  by  February  2007.  NASA  officials  told  us  that  they  extended  the  deadline
for that developer, but as of September 2007 the company still had not accomplished the finan-
cial requirement necessary to proceed to Critical Design Review.
