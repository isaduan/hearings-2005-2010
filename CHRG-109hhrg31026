SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT, TECHNOLOGY, AND
STANDARDS,

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE,

Washington, DC.

The  Subcommittee  met,  pursuant  to  call,  at  1:04  p.m.,  in  Room
2318  of  the  Rayburn  House  Office  Building,  Hon.  Vernon  Ehlers
[Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.

Chairman EHLERS. Good afternoon. I am pleased to welcome you
to  the  first—Subcommittee’s  first  markup  of  the  year.  Pursuant  to
notice,  we  will  consider  three  important  measures  today  that  to-
gether  underlie  the  breadth  of  jurisdiction  of  the  subcommittee.
Given  the  number  of  bills  we  need  to  get  through  today,  my  open-
ing  statement  will  be  brief,  and  then  I  will  explain  each  bill  in
more detail as it is brought up.

First we will consider H.R. 50, the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric  Administration  Act.  This  bill,  a  reintroduction  of  legislation
I  authored  last  Congress,  would  created  an  organic  act  for  NOAA.
This  is  a  term  that  puzzled  me  when  I  first  got  here  because,  to
me, organic had something to do with organic chemistry or organic
gardening or organic food stores; but an organic act in the Congress
is  an  act  which  is  an  original  act  establishing  an  agency  and  out-
lining its functions and purposes. This organic act for NOAA would
provide the underlying statute of missions and functions to be car-
ried out by NOAA, something that has not existed since the agency
was  formed  by  executive  order  in  1970—established  by  executive
order.  It  has  been  modified  by  executive  order  and  by  law  since,
but  we  have  never  had  an  organic  act,  so  today  we  are  trying  to
remedy that.

Next,  we  will  consider  H.R.  250,  the  Manufacturing  Technology
Competitiveness Act. This bill is nearly identical to legislation I in-
troduced last Congress and which passed the House last July. Un-
fortunately, the bill did not receive action in the Senate, and so we
are proposing it once again.

The main focus of the bill is an authorization for the Department

of Commerce Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program.

And finally, we will consider H.R. 798, the Methamphetamine Re-
mediation  Research  Act.  This  bill,  introduced  by  Ranking  Member
Gordon,  Representative  Calvert,  and  Chairman  Boehlert,  would
create a research program at the Environmental Protection Agency
to  study  the  harmful  effects  of  methamphetamine  and  to  provide
important voluntary guidelines for states to use as they try to clean
up  former  meth  laboratories.  I  suspect  many  people  are  not  aware
of  the  extent  of  this  problem  and  the  dangers  involved,  but  meth
labs are springing up, primarily in rural areas, particularly wooded
areas—and  I  know  Oregon  is  having  considerable  problems  with
them;  we  have  in  Michigan  as  well  because  both  states  have  sub-
stantial  wooded  areas  where  you  can  conceal  a  shack  and  try  to
manufacture methamphetamine.

There  are  several  aspects  of  danger  there.  One  is  that  very  fre-
quently, because of the danger of the components—and in fact, the
explosive  nature  of  the  components—frequently  an  explosion  oc-
curs,  which  obliterates  the  shack  and  the  people  within  it,  so  we
lose  a  number  of  young  people  every  year  who  are  engaged  in  this
dangerous  pursuit.  Even  more  frequently,  they  use  a  particular
structure  for  this;  it  becomes  very—it  collects  a  lot  of  toxic  mate-
rials  because  there  is  a  great  deal  of  toxic  material  going  into  the
production  of  methamphetamine.  They  actually  become  not  quite
superfund  sites,  but  pretty  close  to  it,  and  local  governments  are
having  a  great  deal  of  trouble  cleaning  them  up  to  a  reasonable
standard, and the expense is substantial for small units of govern-
ment.

Now,  I  am  pleased  that  Mr.  Wu  has  introduced  this  bill,  which
will  deal  with  this  problem,  not  only  in  Oregon  and  Michigan,  but
throughout the country. With that, I am proud to introduce Mr. Wu
from  Oregon,  the  Subcommittee’s  new  Ranking  Member.  I  have
worked  before  with  Mr.  Wu  on  a  number  of  issues.  I  know  he  has
a  strong  interest  and  considerable  experience  in  the  issues  before
the  Subcommittee.  I  am  very  happy  that  he  has  joined  us  in  this
position.

I  want  to  thank  Mr.  Udall.  He  is  on  the  way  but  not  here  yet.
I  want  to  thank  Mr.  Udall  from  Colorado,  who  was  a  Ranking
Member for the past four years. We had a very productive relation-
ship,  and  now  he  is  Ranking  Member  of  the  Space  Subcommittee,
where spacey Members end up. And I am sorry to lose him for that
purpose,  but  delighted  that  Mr.  Wu  is  his  replacement.  I  am
pleased  that  Mr.  Udall  will  continue  to  be  a  Member  of  the  Sub-
committee.

I  am  now  pleased  to  yield  to  Mr.  Wu  for  an  opening  statement.
[The prepared statement of Chairman Ehlers follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN VERNON J. EHLERS

Good  afternoon!  Welcome  to  the  Subcommittee’s  first  markup  of  the  year.  Pursu-
ant to notice, we will consider three important measures today that together under-
lie  the  breadth  of  jurisdiction  of  the  Subcommittee.  Given  the  number  of  bills  we
need  to  get  through  today,  my  opening  statement  will  be  brief  and  then  I  will  ex-
plain each bill in more detail as it is brought up.

First,  we  will  consider  H.R.  50,  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Adminis-
tration  (NOAA)  Act.  This  bill,  a  reintroduction  of  legislation  I  authored  last  Con-
gress,  would  create  an  ‘‘organic  act’’  for  NOAA.  This  organic  act  would  provide  the
underlying  statute  of  missions  and  functions  to  be  carried  out  by  the  NOAA,  some-
thing that has not existed since the agency was formed by executive order in 1970.

Next,  we  will  consider  H.R.  250,  the  Manufacturing  Technology  Competitiveness
Act. This bill is nearly identical to legislation I introduced last Congress, and which
passed  the  House  last  July.  The  main  focus  of  the  bill  is  an  authorization  for  the
Department  of  Commerce’s  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  (MEP)  program.
And  finally,  we  will  consider  H.R.  798,  the  Methamphetamine  Remediation  Re-
search  Act.  This  bill,  introduced  by  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  Representative  Cal-
vert and Chairman Boehlert, would create a research program at the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to study the harmful effects of methamphetamine and pro-
vide important voluntary guidelines for states to use as they try to clean up former
‘‘meth’’ laboratories.

I  am  proud  to  introduce  Mr.  Wu  from  Oregon,  the  Subcommittee’s  new  Ranking
Member.  I  know  that  Mr.  Wu  has  a  strong  interest  and  considerable  experience  in
the  issues  before  the  Subcommittee,  and  I  am  very  happy  that  he  has  joined  us.
I  want  to  thank  Mr.  Udall,  from  Colorado,  who  was  our  Ranking  Member  for  the
past  four  years.  We  had  a  very  productive  relationship  and  now  he  is  the  Ranking
Member  of  our  Space  Subcommittee.  I  am  pleased  he  will  still  be  a  Member  of  our
subcommittee.

I now yield to Mr. Wu for an opening statement.
Mr.  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I  look  for-
ward  to  working  with  you  in  a  very  productive  relationship  con-
cerning the broad range of this subcommittee’s jurisdiction in tech-
nology  transfer,  competitiveness,  and  other  crucial  issues  for  our
research,  our  tech  transfer,  and  our  economy.  And  in  your  spirit,
Mr.  Chairman,  I  will  be  brief,  even  laconic.  I  am  very  pleased  to
be here with you to participate in our subcommittee’s first markup,
markup  of  the  NOAA  Organic  Act,  the  Manufacturing  Technology
Competitiveness  Act,  and  the  Methamphetamine  Remediation  Re-
search Act. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance
of my time.

Chairman EHLERS. I thank the gentleman and would just correct
myself.  I  mentioned  this  was  your  bill;  it  is  actually  Mr.  Gordon’s
bill,  joined  with  the  methamphetamine.  But  it  is  certainly  a  bill
which is worthy of your attention.

Mister—without  object,  all  Members—all  other  Members  may
place  statements  in  the  records,  and  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to
recess  the  Subcommittee  at  any  point,  and  without  objection  it  is
so ordered; I hear no objection.

We will now consider the bill H.R. 50, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration Act. This bill is identical to the legisla-
tion that I introduced last year and that passed the Subcommittee
at  the  end  of  the  Congressional  session.  Unfortunately,  time  ran
out before we could consider it at Full Committee. H.R. 50 provides
NOAA with an organic act. An organic act defines the overall mis-
sions  and  functions  of  an  agency.  As  an  example,  H.R.  50  states
that  the  mission  of  NOAA  is,  first,  to  understand  and  predict
changes in the Earth’s oceans and atmosphere; second, to conserve
and  manage  coastal,  ocean,  and  great  lakes  ecosystems;  and  third,
to educate the public about these topics. The bill also describes the
specific functions NOAA should carry out to fulfill its mission, such
as issuing weather forecasts and warnings.

I  should  note  that  H.R.  50  contains  very  little  language  about
fisheries  or  research  management  at  NOAA  because  those  topics
are under the jurisdiction of the Resources Committee, and particu-
larly  the  Subcommittee  chaired  by  my  colleague  from  Maryland,
Mr. Gilchrest, who is also, now, a Member of this committee. I look
forward  to  working  with  Mr.  Gilchrest,  my  other  colleagues,  and

the  administration,  as  well  as  with  the  full  Resources  Committee,
to pass truly comprehensive legislation for NOAA.

I am pleased to recognize Mr. Wu if he wishes to make any com-

ments about this bill.

Mr. WU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I fully support your interest
in  moving  forward  to  develop  legislation  that  will  provide  NOAA
with  a  statutory  foundation  to  guide  its  missions  and  functions.  I
congratulate you for introducing H.R. 50.

NOAA  is  this  nation’s  lead  agency  charged  with  conserving  and
managing  our  coastal  and  oceanic  resources.  NOAA  also  plays  a
vital  role  in  public  safety  through  the  programs  of  the  National
Weather Service to issue weather forecasts and warnings. We must
ensure  that  NOAA  has  the  resources  and  authorities  it  needs  to
meet  its  statutory  responsibilities  and  to  accomplish  its  resource
management and public safety missions.

H.R.  50  makes  a  good  start  on  this  effort,  and  I  look  forward  to
working  with  you  further  before  this  legislation  is  considered  by
the full House. And I might add that I also look forward to working
with you and Mr. Gilchrest to have a more robust component with
respect  to  fisheries,  which  are  of  great  interest  to  us  on  either
coast, and I assume, also, in the Great Lakes.

With  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my  time.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Wu follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE DAVID WU

Good  afternoon,  everyone.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  pleased  to  be  here  this  afternoon
to participate in our subcommittee’s first markup of legislation. I realize your inter-
est in moving forward to develop legislation that will provide NOAA with the statu-
tory  foundation  to  guide  its  missions  and  functions.  I  congratulate  you  for  intro-
ducing H.R. 50.

NOAA  is  this  nation’s  lead  agency  charged  with  conserving  and  managing  our
coastal and oceanic resources. NOAA also plays a vital role in public safety through
the programs of the National Weather Service to issue weather forecasts and warn-
ings.

We  must  ensure  that  NOAA  has  the  resources  and  authorities  it  needs  to  meet
its statutory responsibilities and to accomplish its resource management and public
safety missions.

H.R. 50 makes a good start on this effort, and I look forward to working with you

further before this legislation is considered by the Full Science Committee.

Chairman  EHLERS.  I  thank  you  for  your  comments,  and  let  me
just  note  the  presence  of  Mr.  Udall.  Mr.  Udall,  I  paid  you  several
compliments in your absence. I won’t repeat them, but I expressed
my  appreciation  for  your  good  service  as  Ranking  Member  of  this
subcommittee.  We  will  miss  you,  and  I  am  happy  that  you  are
going to continue to be on the Subcommittee.

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  In  the  spirit  of  the  old
adage,  you  never  get  in  trouble  for  something  you  didn’t  say.  I
would just say I think probably those compliments are undeserved,
and  I  do  look  forward  to  working  with  you  as  a  Member  of  the
Committee, and with Ranking Member Wu. Thank you.

Chairman EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for his comments, and

I disagree with him; they are deserved.

I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the  bill  is  considered  as  read  and
open  to  amendment  at  any  point  and  that  the  Members  proceed
with the amendments in the order of the roster. Without objection,
so ordered.

The  first  amendment  on  the  roster  is  an  en  bloc  amendment  of-
fered by Mr. Wu. Are you ready to proceed with your amendment?

Mr. WU. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I have amendment at the desk.
Chairman EHLERS. The Clerk will report the amendment.
The CLERK. Amendment to H.R. 50 offered by Mr. Wu of Oregon.
Chairman EHLERS. I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the

reading. Without objection, so ordered.

Mr.  WU.  My  amendment,  Mr.  Chairman,  does  three  things.  The
first  part  of  my  amendment  clarifies  current  policy  of  having  the
National  Weather  Service  serve  as  the  Nation’s  source  for  issuing
forecasts  and  warnings.  The  public  safety  function  performed  by
the  National  Weather  Service  should  not  be  contracted  to  outside
providers.  There  are  numerous  commercial  weather  providers  that
also  have  an  important  role  to  play  in  weather  forecasting.  They
and  the  National  Weather  Service  have  developed  a  productive
partnership  that  serves  our  nation  well.  This  language  ensures
that it will continue to do so.

The  second  part  of  my  amendment  ensures  the  continuance  of
the  agreements  between  NOAA  and  its  established  employee  orga-
nization.  The  final  part  of  my  amendment  requires  NOAA  to  en-
gage the agency’s client base, this Congress, and their own employ-
ees in the development of any organizational changes.

NOAA partners include State and local governments, commercial
interests  in  recreation,  fishing,  navigation,  and  weather  fore-
casting, the research and education communities, and conservation
organizations.  NOAA  reorganizations  should  not  occur  without  the
involvement of the many organizations that work with NOAA.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  understand  that  you  will  be  supporting  my

amendment. I yield back.

Chairman  EHLERS.  I  thank  Mr.  Wu  for  working  with  us  on  his
amendment. It is a worthy amendment. I believe it strengthens the
bill, and the Chair is pleased to support this amendment.

Is there any further discussion on this amendment? None?
Mr. UDALL. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.
Chairman EHLERS. The gentleman may proceed for five minutes.
Mr.  UDALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  in  the  interest  of  moving  the  legisla-
tion forward, I don’t have an amendment, but I would like clarifica-
tion on an issue of concern to me, and I believe to all of the Mem-
bers  of  the  Committee.  The  mission  we  are  defining  for  NOAA  is
a  broad  one,  and  I  certainly  agree  that  NOAA’s  mission  should  be
defined  broadly  to  include  the  many  important  operation  and  re-
search  functions  it  performs  for  our  nation.  However,  I  am  con-
cerned  about  the  potential  for  overlap  with  NASA’s  mission.  And
as you know, reports have surfaced at various times, indicating the
possibility  that  NASA’s  Earth  science  programs  might  be  trans-
ferred  to  NOAA.  And  I  was  curious  if  it  was  your  intention  to  en-
dorse or facilitate that type of transfer through this legislation.

Chairman EHLERS.—with your comment.
Mr. UDALL. I would be happy to yield to the——
Chairman EHLERS. I thank gentleman for yielding.
There  is  no  intent  in  this  bill  to  favor  that  one  way  or  the  other
and  no  plans  to  do  any  such  thing.  It  is  true  there  is  overlap  be-
tween NOAA and NASA. There is also overlap between NOAA and
the  armed  services  with  the  new  satellite  program.  And  I  think—

my  personal  opinion  is  that  there  is  going  to  have  to  be  much
greater  effort  made  in  NOAA—and  I  hope  it  will  occur  under  this
bill—to  work  more  closely  with  other  agencies  with  which  they
have joint interests. And that, of course, includes NASA as well as
the  armed  forces  and  perhaps  other  government  agencies,  perhaps
the Department of Interior as an example. So my hope is that oper-
ating  under  an  organic  act,  it  will  be  easier  for  them  to  develop
interagency  agreements  to  deal  with  these  issues.  At  this  point,  it
has been pretty much on an ad hoc basis, as far as I can see, par-
ticularly with the satellite program.

So  there  is  no  ulterior  motive  in  the  bill  to  deal  with  this,  and
so  far  as  I  know,  nothing  in  the  bill  would  encourage  that  sort  of
thing.  But  it  would  be  something  that  we  would  be  involved  in
judging on a case-by-case basis, as they present.

Mr.  UDALL.  I  thank  the  Chairman.  And  reclaiming  my  time,  if

I could ask just one follow-on question?

I  understand  we  are  planning  a  hearing  on  NASA’s  Earth
sciences  program  in  the  near  future,  and  it  would  be  my  hope
that—and  this  is  the  thrust  of  my  question—we  would  have  that
hearing  before  we  markup  H.R.  50  in  the  Full  Committee.  And  I
would be happy to yield to the gentleman again.

Chairman EHLERS. I assume that hearing would be on the Space
Subcommittee  rather  than  this  subcommittee,  so  I  would  suggest
that  since  you  are  on  that  committee  that  you  make  that  request
known  to  the  Chairman.  I  would  not  want  to  hold  up  H.R.  50  at
any point, but if that Subcommittee wishes to conduct such a hear-
ing early on, that would be most helpful.

Mr.  UDALL.  Reclaiming  my  time,  I  hear  the  gentleman  sug-
gesting that he would be amenable to the Space Subcommittee tak-
ing a look at that this, but you don’t want to slow down the process
that H.R. 50——

Chairman  EHLERS.  The  gentleman  is  correct,  and  that  is  based
on  consideration  of  how  rapidly  or  not  rapidly  bills  tend  to  move
through  Committee—through  the  House,  through  the  Senate,  and
I  want  to  make  certain  that  this  gets  passed  during  this  Congress
and preferably this year if at all possible. But I would be happy to
work with the Chair of the Space Subcommittee on a joint hearing
if he would wish to do it.

Mr. UDALL. That seems to be the general thrust here, and I will
talk  to  Chairman  Calvert  as  well,  and  I  look  forward  to  working
with  you,  and  we  will  prove,  Mr.  Chairman,  Ross  Perot  wrong
where  he  said  a  committee  is  a  cul-de-sac  down  which  great  ideas
go to die. So we have, I think a bigger load to shoulder here when
it comes to proving Mr. Perot wrong.

Chairman  EHLERS.  Well,  you  also  have  to  remember  that  was  a
goal  of  the  founders  of  this  nation,  to  make  a  structure  so  com-
plicated  that  very  few  things  would  pass,  assuming  that  only  the
best would survive. But since this bill is so superb, we are not wor-
ried about what the process might do to it.

Any  further  comments  on  the  amendment?  Hearing  none,  the
vote occurs on the amendment. All in favor, say aye. Those opposed
say no. The yeas have it, and the amendment is agreed to.

Are there any other amendments? Hearing none, the question is
on the bill. H.R. 50, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-

tion Act, as amended—all those in favor will say aye. All those op-
posed will say no. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it.

I will now recognize Mr. Wu for a motion.
Mr.  WU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that
the Subcommittee favorably report the bill H.R. 50, as amended, to
the  Full  Committee.  Further,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the
staff  be  instructed  to  make  all  necessary  technical  and  conforming
changes  to  the  bill  as  amended,  in  accordance  with  the  rec-
ommendations of the Subcommittee.

Chairman  EHLERS.  The  question  is  on  the  motion  to  report  the
bill as amended favorably. Those in favor of the motion will signify
by saying aye. Opposed, no. The motion carries, and the bill favor-
ably reported. Without object, the motion to reconsider is laid upon
the table.

I thank the Committee very much.
Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
I  wish  to  express  my  appreciation  to  all  of  the  Members  of  the
Committee  for  the  rapid  action  on  this  group  of  bills  and  the  good
spirit in which we have all approached these bills and trying to im-
prove  them.  So  I  appreciate  your  consideration.  I  thank  the  Com-
mittee  Members  for  their  attendance.  This  concludes  our  sub-
committee markup.

[Whereupon, at 1:46 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE  FULL  COMMITTEE
MARKUP  ON  H.R.  50,  NATIONAL  OCEANIC
AND  ATMOSPHERIC  ADMINISTRATION  ACT

TUESDAY,  MAY  17,  2005

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE,

Washington, DC.

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  call,  at  10:08  a.m.,  in  Room
2318  of  the  Rayburn  House  Office  Building,  Hon.  Sherwood  L.
Boehlert [Chairman of the Committee] presiding.

Chairman BOEHLERT. I want to welcome everyone here today for
this  markup  of  bills  concerning  the  heavens  and  the  Earth  and  to
the agencies that explore them, NOAA and NASA.

Now  let  me  just  say  this  before  I  give  you  the  rest  of  this  won-

derful statement.

The Committee on Science will come to order. Pursuant to notice,
the  Committee  on  Science  meets  to  consider  the  following  meas-
ures:  H.R.  50,  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration
Act;  H.R.  2363,  To  establish  a  Science  and  Technology  Scholarship
Program  to  award  scholarships  to  recruit  and  prepare  students  for
careers  in  the  National  Weather  Service  and  in  the  National  Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration marine research, atmospheric
research, and satellite programs; H.R. 426, Remote Sensing Applica-
tions  Act  of  2005,  and  H.R.  1022,  the  George  E.  Brown,  Jr.  Near-
Earth Object Survey Act.

I  ask  unanimous  consent  for  the  authority  to  recess  the  Com-
mittee  at  any  point  during  consideration  of  these  matters,  and
without objection, it is so ordered.

We  will  now  proceed  with  the  markup  beginning  with  the  open-

ing statements, and I will continue mine.

The  main  bill  before  us  today  is  the  NOAA  Organic  Act  intro-
duced by Dr. Ehlers, which we had initially planned to markup last
week. This bill will give NOAA a firm legislative grounding, some-
thing that was called for by the Ocean Commission, among others.
The  Administration  has  also  called  for  an  Organic  Act  for  NOAA.
But  our  bill  will  do  more  than  merely  found  NOAA  into  law.  It
will  raise  the  profile  of  science  at  NOAA  and  improve  its  manage-
ment. The bill also will greatly improve oversight of the agency by
ensuring  that  Congress  and  the  public  get  the  information  needed
to evaluate NOAA’s organizational structure, facilities plans, budg-
eting, and satellite programs. This is a solid bill that will strength-
en the agency.

And  now  we  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Resources  Com-
mittee, which shares jurisdiction over portions of NOAA, to get this
bill  to  the  Floor.  Also  related  to  NOAA,  we  will  take  up  Congress-
man Rohrabacher’s bill to create a Scholarship for Service Program
at  NOAA.  And  he  is  a  real  leader  on  that  effort,  and  we  applaud
that.  We  have  done  the  same  thing  with  NASA  and  the  Depart-
ment of Energy. Service scholarships are a great way to entice stu-
dents  into  science,  math,  and  engineering  while  also  helping  the
Federal  Government  develop  the  workforce  it  will  need.  These
scholarships  have  been  championed  tirelessly  by  Congressman
Rohrabacher, and I congratulate him for that.

We  are  running  the  scholarship  program  through  as  a  separate
bill, because specific program authorizations generally are not part
of  agency  Organic  Acts.  We  will  also  take  up  two  bills  related  to
space  today.  These  were  last-minute  additions  to  today’s  roster,
which  is  something  we  have  generally  avoided  on  this  committee.
But  this  seemed  like  an  opportune  time  to  move  these  bills,  and
we  continue  to  work  on  them  through  manager’s  amendments  on
the Floor.

Mr. Udall’s bill, which the Committee also passed last Congress,
concerns  remote  sensing.  Mr.  Udall  will  offer  an  amendment  that
will  take  care  of  concerns  raised  by  companies  in  the  remote  sens-
ing data business, concerns that have stymied progress on this bill
in  the  past.  I  know  that  Mr.  Bonner  and  I,  perhaps  some  others,
have  some  further  ideas  for  perfecting  the  bill,  and  we  will  work
on those as the bill moves forward.

Mr.  Rohrabacher’s  bill  focuses  on  near-Earth  objects,  a  subject
that has long concerned him and has gotten quite a bit of publicity
lately.  Congressman  Rohrabacher  has  helped  us  all  understand
that asteroids may present a real threat to Earth and that we need
to pay greater attention to them. All of these bills will improve our
lives  through  increasing  our  understanding  of  the  Earth,  how  it
works, and what may threaten it.

As  usual,  these  bills  represent  a  bipartisan  effort,  and  I  take

pride in that. I look forward to their passage.

The Chair recognizes Mr. Gordon.
Mr. Gordon.
[The prepared statement of Chairman Boehlert follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERWOOD L. BOEHLERT

I  want  to  welcome  everyone  here  today  for  this  markup  of  bills  concerning  the
heavens  and  the  Earth—and  to  the  agencies  that  explore  them,  NOAA  and  NASA.
The main bill before us today is the NOAA Organic Act, introduced by Dr. Ehlers,
which  we  had  initially  planned  to  mark  up  last  week.  This  bill  will  give  NOAA  a
firm legislative grounding, something that was called for by the Ocean Commission
among others. The Administration has also called for an Organic Act for NOAA.

But our bill will do more than merely found NOAA in law. It will raise the profile
of science at NOAA and improve its management. The bill also will greatly improve
oversight  of  the  agency  by  ensuring  that  Congress—and  the  public—get  the  infor-
mation  needed  to  evaluate  NOAA’s  organizational  structure,  facilities  plans,  budg-
eting and satellite programs. This is a solid bill that will strengthen the agency.

And now we look forward to working with the Resources Committee, which shares

jurisdiction over portions of NOAA, to get this bill to the Floor.

Also  related  to  NOAA,  we  will  take  up  Congressman  Rohrabacher’s  bill  to  create
a  scholarship  for  service  program  at  NOAA,  as  we  have  at  NASA  and  the  Depart-
ment of Energy. Service scholarships are a great way to entice students into science,
math and engineering while also helping the Federal Government develop the work-

force it will need. These scholarships have been championed tirelessly by Congress-
man Rohrabacher, and I congratulate him for that.

We  are  running  the  scholarship  program  through  as  a  separate  bill  because  spe-

cific program authorizations generally are not part of agency organic acts.

We will also take up two bills related to space today. These were last minute addi-
tions  to  today’s  roster,  which  is  something  we  have  generally  avoided  on  this  com-
mittee. But this seemed like an opportune time to move these bills, and we can con-
tinue to work on them through manager’s amendments on the Floor.

Mr. Udall’s bill, which the Committee also passed last Congress, concerns remote
sensing.  Mr.  Udall  will  offer  an  amendment  that  will  take  care  of  concerns  raised
by  companies  in  the  remote  sensing  data  business—concerns  that  have  stymied
progress  on  this  bill  in  the  past.  I  know  that  Mr.  Bonner  and  I  and  perhaps  some
others  have  some  further  ideas  for  ‘‘perfecting’’  the  bill,  and  we  will  work  on  those
as the bill moves forward.

Mr. Rohrabacher’s bill focuses on Near-Earth Objects, a subject that has long con-
cerned  him  and  that  has  gotten  quite  a  bit  of  press  lately.  Congressman  Rohr-
abacher  has  helped  us  all  understand  that  asteroids  may  present  a  real  threat  to
Earth and that we need to pay greater attention to them.

All  of  these  bills  will  improve  our  lives  through  increasing  our  understanding  of
the  Earth,  how  it  works  and  what  may  threaten  it.  As  usual,  these  bills  represent
a bipartisan effort. I look forward to their passage.

Mr. Gordon.
Mr.  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  You  have  summed  up
what we are going to do this morning very well. I just want to con-
cur that it is a good idea, I think, to take up these additional three
bills today, and I want to give my thanks to the staff on both sides
for  the  good  cooperative  work  that  they  have  done  over  the  last
week in trying to bring NOAA together as well as these three bills,
and I look forward to the markup.

And I yield my time back.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

I want to thank the Chairman for scheduling this markup.
Originally  we  were  to  just  take  up  H.R.  50  today,  but  I  think  it  is  to  the  advan-
tage  of  our  Members  that  we  will  expeditiously  take  up  three  other  bills,  all  of
which can probably move on suspension on the Floor.

In  addition  to  the  NOAA  organic  act,  I  am  especially  pleased  to  see  the  Remote
Sensing  Act  move  through  Committee.  We  have  dealt  with  this  in  past  Congresses
and I am happy the Chairman agrees that we can move that bill forward today.

I don’t want to delay the process here this morning with an extensive preliminary
statement,  but  let  me  take  a  moment  to  thank  staff  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  for
their work to handle these bills. I think the Members have been well served through
their efforts.

With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Without  objection,  Members  may  place  statements  in  the  record

at this point.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE DAVID WU

Good morning, everyone. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to be here today to partici-
pate  in  the  Science  Committee’s  markup  of  H.R.  50.  I  appreciate  your  interest  in
moving  forward  to  develop  legislation  that  will  provide  NOAA  with  the  statutory
foundation to guide its missions and functions.

NOAA  is  this  nation’s  lead  agency  charged  with  conserving  and  managing  our
coastal and oceanic resources. NOAA also plays a vital role in public safety through
the programs of the National Weather Service to issue weather forecasts and warn-
ings. We must ensure that NOAA has the resources and authorities it needs to meet
its statutory responsibilities and to accomplish its resource management and public
safety missions. H.R. 50 makes a good start on this effort, and we want to continue

to  work  with  Chairman  Boehlert  and  the  majority  on  the  dollar  figures  for  facility
changes.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Jackson Lee follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

Mr. Chairman,

The  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  Act  is  an  important  piece
of legislation that deserves strong consideration along with the appropriate Amend-
ments.  NOAA  was  created  through  the  merger  of  a  number  of  organizations  in  the
1970s.  However,  it  still  has  no  legislation  that  establishes  it  as  an  Agency  or  for-
mally defines it missions.

The  legislation  before  this  committee  today  will  help  to  refine  the  mission  of
NOAA and allow the agency to succeed in the future. Specifically, the legislation au-
thored  by  my  colleague  Mr.  Ehlers  will  define  broad  mission  areas  and  general  au-
thorities  and  to  codify  the  existing  primary  administrative  positions  at  NOAA.
Based upon text from the Ocean Commission report this bill defines the mission and
function  of  NOAA.  The  bill  codifies  the  current  senior  positions  of  the  agency:  Ad-
ministrator/Under  Secretary  of  Commerce  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere  and  the  As-
sistant  Secretary  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere.  The  current  positions  of  Deputy
Under  Secretary  and  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere  are
also  specifically  authorized  and  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  International  Af-
fairs.

Among  the  provisions  I  am  most  supportive  of  is  Section  5  of  the  bill  which  calls
upon NOAA to maintain the National Weather Service as a distinct entity. The Na-
tional Weather Service Employees Organization (NWSEO) is very supportive of this
position.  NWS  forms  a  major  part  of  NOAA’s  operational  mission  and  I  have  long
advocated  that  accurate  weather  forecasting  is  not  only  useful  for  planning  pur-
poses,  but  can  also  be  used  in  possible  life  saving  capacity  as  the  technology  con-
tinues to develop.

This  legislation  needs  to  be  clearer  on  certain  issues;  I  am  especially  concerned
about  the  issue  of  separation  between  the  mission  of  NOAA  and  the  Earth  science
programs  at  NASA.  As  we  heard  last  week  from  testimony  provided  by  Mr.  Diaz
of  NASA  at  last  week’s  Full  Committee  hearing,  he  indicated  NASA’s  plan  for  a
number  of  their  missions  (Landsat,  Glory)  will  be  to  transfer  these  Earth  science
programs to NOAA. In addition, the Ocean Commission Report suggests that NOAA
should take on NASA’s Earth sciences programs. Firstly, I am against the idea that
Earth  science  programs  should  be  diminished  at  NASA.  Secondly,  NOAA’s  budget
cannot absorb these programs in its current budget. The current mission statement
in the bill does create overlap with the mission statement for NASA. Clarifying lan-
guage should be inserted to ensure that these necessary Earth science programs are
continued in one fashion or another.

Again, I believe this legislation is pertinent and should be implemented with due
consideration  for  all  amendments.  NOAA  deserves  to  have  proper  mission  which  is
achievable under the right parameters.

Thank you.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  We  will  now  consider  H.R.  50,  National
Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  Act.  I  recognize  Dr.
Ehlers to present some introductory remarks.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  the  opportunity  to

explain my bill.

This  is  certainly  an  important  bill,  and  I  say  that  not  because  I
have a large ego, but because it is very rare that we have an oppor-
tunity to pass an organic act through this committee. And this bill,
H.R. 50, establishes an organic act for NOAA, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration Act.

An  organic  act  defines  the  overall  mission  and  functions  of  an
agency.  As  an  example,  my  bill  states  that  the  mission  of  NOAA
is  to,  first,  understand  and  predict  changes  in  the  Earth’s  oceans
and  atmosphere;  second,  conserve  and  manage  coastal,  ocean,  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:18 Jan 02, 2007 Jkt 031026 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\109MAR~1\COMP\COMP.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

47

Great  Lakes  ecosystems;  and  third,  educate  the  public  about  these
topics.

NOAA  was  created  in  1970  by  an  Executive  Order  that  placed
the  agency  in  the  Department  of  Commerce  and  transferred  var-
ious oceanic and atmospheric functions from other agencies into the
new NOAA. Since that time, NOAA has operated under a confusing
collection of issue-specific laws that are not coordinated by an over-
arching mission, therefore, the need for an organic act.

In  September  2004,  the  U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy  re-
leased its final report, which called for Congress to pass an organic
act  for  NOAA  and  clarify  in  one  place  the  mission  and  program
goals  of  the  agency.  The  Bush  Administration  supports  Congres-
sional  passage  of  a  NOAA  and  organic  act  and  made  it  a  priority
in the Administration formal response to the Ocean Commission re-
port. In the 108th Congress, witnesses at Science Committee hear-
ings strongly endorsed this bill.

Today,  I  will  offer  a  manager’s  amendment,  which  makes  tech-
nical  corrections  and  reflects  negotiations  with  the  minority.  I  will
explain the amendment further when it is offered.

I  should  note  that  H.R.  50  contains  little  language  about  fish-
eries  management  at  NOAA,  because  that  topic  is  under  the  juris-
diction of the Resources Committee, and in particular, the jurisdic-
tion  of  the  Subcommittee  chaired  by  my  colleague  from  Maryland,
Mr. Gilchrest.

I  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Members  of  that  committee
to  join  us  in  passing  truly  comprehensive  legislation  for  NOAA.  I
urge  my  colleagues  today  to  support  H.R.  50,  and  I  yield  back  the
balance of my time.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Ehlers follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE VERNON J. EHLERS

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  the  opportunity  to  explain  my  bill.  H.R.  50,  the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Act, is an organic act for NOAA.
An organic act defines the overall mission and functions of an agency. As an exam-
ple, my bill states that the mission of NOAA is to:

(1) understand and predict changes in the Earth’s oceans and atmosphere;
(2) conserve and manage coastal, ocean, and Great Lakes ecosystems; and
(3) educate the public about these topics.

NOAA  was  created  in  1970  by  an  executive  order  that  placed  the  agency  in  the
Department  of  Commerce  and  transferred  various  oceanic  and  atmospheric  func-
tions from other agencies into the new NOAA. Since that time, NOAA has operated
under  a  confusing  collection  of  issue-specific  laws  that  are  not  coordinated  by  an
overarching mission.

In September 2004, the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy released its final report,
which called for Congress to pass an organic act for NOAA and clarify in one place
the  mission  and  program  goals  of  the  agency.  The  Bush  Administration  supports
Congressional passage of a NOAA organic act, and made it a priority in the Admin-
istration  formal  response  to  the  Ocean  Commission  report.  In  the  108th  Congress
witnesses at Science Committee hearings strongly endorsed my bill.

Today I will offer a manager’s amendment which makes technical corrections and
reflects  negotiations  with  the  minority.  I  will  explain  the  amendment  further  when
it is offered.

I  should  note  that  H.R.  50  contains  little  language  about  fisheries  management
at  NOAA  because  that  topic  is  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Resources  Committee,
in  particular  the  Subcommittee  chaired  by  my  colleague  from  Maryland,  Mr.
Gilchrest. I look forward to working with the Members of that committee to join us
in  passing  truly  comprehensive  legislation  for  NOAA.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  sup-
port H.R. 50, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Dr.  Ehlers,  and  a
special thanks from all of us for your hard work to bring us to the
point where we find ourselves today.

Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Once  again,  let  me  say  that  I  think  Mr.  Ehlers  has  done  a  good
job  in  evaluating  this  bill,  and  I  want  to  thank  him  for  the  work
with his staff in putting it together.

A couple of concerns I do have, though, is that we are still trying
to  determine  what  is  an  appropriate  value  to  be  triggering  the  re-
view  process.  The  bill  has  a  $5  million  limit,  but  I  think  the  Com-
mittee needs to do some more work on this to make sure that that
really is a valid number, and I am sure we will be doing that before
it  goes  to  the  Floor.  And  I  do  appreciate  Mr.  Ehlers’  work  in  the
past.

Finally,  let  me  just  say  that  the  bill  defines  a  broad  mission  for
NOAA to allow this agency to grow and change as needed to serve
our  resource  needs  as  our  nation  grows  and  changes.  However,  I
do  not  believe  the  broadly-defined  mission  in  this  bill  should  serve
as  an  invitation  to  this  or  future  Administrations  to  transfer  pro-
grams  from  other  agencies  to  NOAA  without  sufficient  planning
and adequate funding. And I think that is very important.

We  look  forward  to  working  with  you  and  our  colleagues  on  the
Committee of Resources as this bill continues to move forward, and
I yield back my time.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  for  bringing  H.R.  50  before  the  Committee  this  morn-
ing.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  Rep.  Ehlers  for  introducing  the  NOAA  Organic  Act.
I  recognize  H.R.  50  is  not  yet  a  true  organic  act  for  NOAA.  The  bill  does  not  in-
clude  important  authorities  and  functions  in  fisheries,  coastal  zone  management,
ocean  mapping  and  charting,  and  a  number  of  other  important  operations  that  are
in the jurisdiction of the Committee on Resources.

This committee’s programs, however, are well-treated in this legislation. I am es-
pecially pleased that we are including explicit language to ensure that the structure
and function of the National Weather Service remains unchanged.

The  3,700  employees  of  the  National  Weather  Service  fulfill  a  vital  public  safety
mission across this nation everyday in cooperation with the network of professionals
in the private sector.

We have worked well together on language to try to establish a regular procedure
for proposed changes in NOAA facilities. However, I want to keep working to under-
stand  what  an  appropriate  dollar  value  is  to  trigger  that  review  process.  The  bill
has  $5  million,  but  I  think  the  Committee  needs  to  do  more  work  before  this  bill
gets  to  the  floor  to  understand  all  the  implications  of  this  language.  We  do  have
some  information  from  NOAA  on  this,  but  since  they  prefer  the  $5  million  number
I think we need to double check some of that information.

We  have  achieved  steady  improvements  to  our  weather  forecasting  through  in-
vestments  in  research  and  technology  and  the  expansion  of  our  system  of  weather
observing  satellites.  We  should  ensure  continued  progress  in  weather  forecasting
and understanding the Earth’s atmospheric and oceanic systems.

The  bill  defines  a  broad  mission  for  NOAA  to  allow  this  agency  to  grow  and
change  as  needed  to  serve  our  resource  needs  as  our  nation  grows  and  changes.
However,  I  do  not  believe  the  broadly  defined  mission  in  this  bill  should  serve  as
an  invitation  to  this  or  a  future  Administration  to  transfer  programs  from  other
agencies to NOAA without sufficient planning and adequate funding.

We look forward to working with you and our colleagues on the Committee on Re-

sources as this bill moves forward.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.

I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered as read and
open  to  amendment  at  any  point  and  that  Members  proceed  with
the  amendments  in  the  order  of  the  roster.  Without  objection,  so
ordered.

The  first  amendment  on  the  roster  is  an  amendment  offered  in
the  nature  of  a  substitute  offered  by  Dr.  Ehlers.  I  ask  unanimous
consent that the amendment in the nature of a substitute be treat-
ed  as  original  text  for  purposes  of  amendment  under  the  five-
minute rule. Without objection, so ordered.

Dr. Ehlers, are you ready to proceed?
Mr. EHLERS. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
This substitute amendment strengthens and clarifies certain sec-

tions of H.R. 50.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Excuse me, Dr. Ehlers.
The Clerk will report the amendment, and then we will hear the

eloquent words of Dr. Ehlers.

Mr. EHLERS. I have an amendment at the desk.
Ms.  TESSIERI.  Amendment  in  the  nature  of  a  substitute  to  H.R.

50 offered by Mr. Ehlers of Michigan.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with

the reading. Without objection, so ordered.

The gentleman is recognized for five minutes.
Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This substitute amendment strengthens and clarifies certain sec-
tions  of  H.R.  50,  as  it  was  reported  by  the  Environment,  Tech-
nology, and Standards Committee. Specifically, as compared to the
bill  as  reported,  my  amendment  first  provides  technical  clarifica-
tion.  It  also  provides  additional  authorities  of  the  Administrator  of
NOAA, such as conducting education and outreach activities. It em-
phasizes  NOAA’s  role  in  forecasting  of  and  warning  for  tsunamis.
It  also  provides  for  input  from  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences
earlier  in  the  process  of  NOAA  developing  its  strategic  plan  for
management of its environmental data and information systems. It
requires NOAA to notify Congress when NOAA starts new satellite
programs,  encounters  serious  problems  with,  or  makes  major
changes  to  existing  satellite  programs,  and  finally  clarifies  that
nothing  in  the  bill  shall  alter  the  responsibilities  or  authorities  of
other federal agencies.

These changes were developed after careful consultation with the
Administration,  outside  experts,  NOAA  stakeholders,  and  other
Members of this committee.

I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  this  substitute  amendment  for

H.R. 50 and yield back the balance of my time.

Chairman BOEHLERT. I want to thank Dr. Ehlers for his work on

the bill, and the Chair supports his amendment.
Is there further discussion on the amendment?
Mr. UDALL. Mr. Chairman, I would move to strike the last word.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Who seeks recognition?
Mr. Udall, my distinguished colleague and good friend from Colo-

Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I will be brief, I hope.
I  am  pleased  to  see  some  of  the  changes  included  in  my  good
friend, Dr. Ehlers’ amendment regarding the evaluation process for
the  closures,  relocation,  or  consolidation  of  NOAA  facilities.  Par-
ticularly,  I  am  pleased  to  see  that  the  Congress  must  be  notified
if any NOAA facility will be closed, relocated, or consolidated. This
covers  183  facilities  that  could  have  been  closed  without  Congres-
sional notification under the original definition of a facility as hav-
ing a budget greater than $1 million.

I  am  also  pleased  that  the  language  has  been  included  to  evalu-
ate  National  Weather  Service’s  field  offices  by  involving  a  similar
evaluation  process  used  in  the  National  Weather  Modernization
Act.

These  are  both  good  government  provisions,  and  I  am  pleased

that they have been included in Dr. Ehlers’ amendment.

However,  I  would  like  to  express  my  concern  that  there  are  at
least  28  NOAA  facilities  with  budgets  between  $1  million  and  $5
million. NOAA will merely have to notify Congress of closures, relo-
cations,  or  consolidations  of  these  facilities  without  going  through
an evaluation process. I do not believe that we know enough about
how  this  will  affect  these  28  facilities  at  this  time  to  set  the  num-
ber at $5 million.

While  I  do  not  want  to  try  to  amend  this  language  in  an  effort
to move the bill through Committee, I plan to continue to work on
the  issue  in  an  effort  to  ensure  that  any  changes  to  the  organiza-
tion of NOAA facilities is thoroughly evaluated and services are not
degraded.

In conclusion, I would like to thank the Chairman and Dr. Ehlers
for working with me on this issue, and I look forward to continuing
this  working  relationship  in  the  future  as  we  move  this  bill  for-
ward.

With that, Mr. Chairman, I would yield back any time I have re-

maining. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MARK UDALL

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.
I  am  pleased  to  see  some  of  the  changes  included  in  this  amendment  regarding
the  evaluation  process  for  the  closures,  relocation,  or  consolidation  of  NOAA  facili-
ties.

Particularly, I am pleased to see that Congress must be notified if any NOAA fa-
cility  will  be  closed,  relocated  or  consolidated.  This  covers  183  facilities  that  could
have  been  closed  without  Congressional  notification  under  the  original  definition  of
a facility as having a budget greater than $1 million.

I am also pleased that language has been included to evaluate National Weather
Services  field  offices  by  involving  a  similar  evaluation  process  used  in  the  National
Weather Modernization Act.

These  are  both  good  government  provisions  and  I  am  pleased  they  have  been  in-

cluded in Mr. Ehlers amendment.

However,  I  would  like  to  express  my  concern  that  there  are  at  least  28  NOAA
facilities with budgets between $1 and $5 million. NOAA will merely have to notify
Congress  of  closures,  relocations  or  consolidations  of  these  facilities  without  going
through an evaluation process.

I do not believe that we know enough about how this will affect these 28 facilities

at this time to set the number at $5 million.

While  I  do  not  want  to  try  to  amend  this  language  in  an  effort  to  move  the  bill
through  Committee,  I  plan  to  continue  to  work  on  issue  in  an  effort  to  ensure  that
any  changes  to  the  organization  of  NOAA  facilities  is  thoroughly  evaluated  and
services are not degraded.

I  would  like  to  thank  the  Chairman  and  Mr.  Ehlers  for  working  with  me  on  this

issue and hope to continue this working relationship in the future.

With that Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Udall,  and  we
will  be  glad  to  continue  our  work  with  you,  because  you  bring  up
a very good point. It is one that should concern us all, and we will
work cooperatively to get the best possible result.

The vote, then, is on—all right.
The second amendment on the roster is offered by the gentleman

from Illinois, Mr. Costello. Are you ready to proceed?

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am.  My  amendment  is  at  the

Chairman BOEHLERT. The Clerk will read the amendment.
Ms. TESSIERI. Amendment offered by Mr. Costello of Illinois.
Mr.  COSTELLO.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  that  we  dispense  with  the

reading of the amendment.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Without objection, so ordered.
The  gentleman  is  recognized  for  five  minutes  to  explain  his

amendment.

Mr. COSTELLO. Mr. Chairman, I thank you.
And Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a ‘‘buy American and pro-
tect  American  jobs’’  amendment.  The  amendment  is  straight-
forward, and it will protect American jobs.

Mr.  Chairman,  my  amendment  addresses  two  contracting  issues
with NOAA. One, it prohibits federal jobs from being outsourced to
foreign nations, and two, it requires NOAA contracts for goods and
services to be performed in the United States.

In  cases  where  NOAA  issues  a  contract  for  goods  or  services  to
a  private-sector  contractor,  NOAA  would  have  to  ensure  that  the
contract  work  is  being  done  in  the  United  States.  Foreign  labor
may not be substituted for U.S. labor.

The amendment provides exceptions to this policy. One, the new
Administrator  may  waive  the  requirement  if  an  essential  instru-
ment  or  service  is  only  produced  outside  the  United  States  or  is
only produced by non-U.S. manufacturers. Two, the President may

waive the requirement if, in his opinion, it is in the interest of na-
tional  security.  Three,  the  restriction  does  not  apply  to  goods  or
services that are now obtained for use outside of the United States
or in case where the functions are performed by U.S. federal work-
ers outside the United States.

Regardless  of  how  Members  of  the  Committee  feel  about  the  A–
76 process on either side of the aisle, we should have an agreement
that  tax  dollars  should  not  be  spent  to  create  jobs  in  other  coun-
tries and put Americans out of work. We must look for ways to pro-
tect  our  national  economy.  NOAA  should  be  getting  its  goods  and
services  here  in  America,  not  abroad.  We  may  not  be  able  to  keep
the  big  multi-national  firms  from  moving  offshore  or  setting  up
supply chains that stretch from China to our local retailers, but we
ought to be able to block NOAA from doing exactly that.

And  Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  for  your  support  and  ask  for  the  sup-

port of Members of the Committee, and I——

ber.

Mr. GORDON. Would the gentleman yield?
Mr.  COSTELLO.  I  would  be  happy  to  yield  to  the  Ranking  Mem-

Mr.  GORDON.  Let  me  just  quickly  say  that,  as  you  pointed  out,
we  are  all  aware  that  the  Administration  has  launched  an  aggres-
sive effort to cut government jobs through the A–76 circular out of
OMB.  And  we  all  want  to  see  government  work  as  efficiently  as
possible, but I think the jury is still out on this outsourcing, wheth-
er  it  really  is  effective.  But  clearly,  your  niche  in  this  of  not  send-
ing  jobs  overseas  is  an  important  one.  I  think  that  it  is  something
that  we  can  all  agree  upon,  and  I  commend  you  for  this  amend-
ment.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
The gentleman’s time has expired.
I know the gentleman’s amendment is well-intended, and none of
us  would  argue  with  its  thrust  to  keep  and  create  jobs  in  the
United  States.  I  always  say  that  ‘‘jobs’’  is  my  favorite  four-letter
word.

But here is the problem with the amendment.
In  many  ways,  it  runs  afoul  of  our  international  trade  obliga-
tions.  We  all  know  the  world  is  flat.  We  are  constantly  reminded
of  that  every  single  day.  Specifically,  we  have  signed  treaties  in
which we and the other signatories agree not to limit most govern-
ment  procurements.  And  guess  why  we  do  that.  We  do  it  because
we  think  it  will  help  keep  and  create  jobs  in  the  United  States  by
enabling  U.S.  companies  to  compete  for  government  contracts
abroad.  There  is  no  way  to  know  for  sure,  but  it  is  perfectly  likely
that this amendment would actually cost jobs in the United States
by preventing U.S. companies from winning procurement contracts
overseas.

Moreover, the amendment is at odds with our international obli-
gations and possibly endangers American jobs, even though no one
can point to a particular problem that this amendment is designed
to resolve.

Is  there  any  indication  that  NOAA  has  been  loose  with  the  tax-
payers’  money  by  needlessly  sending  money  overseas?  The  answer
is  no.  This  amendment  is  a  well-meaning,  symbolic  expression  of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:18 Jan 02, 2007 Jkt 031026 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\109MAR~1\COMP\COMP.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

53

the concern we all have with outsourcing, but it is not designed to
combat a specific known problem.

But  it  would  create  specific  known  problems  by  conflicting  with
trade agreements. And I would add that the Administration strenu-
ously objects for that same reason.

So  I  will  offer  a  second-degree  amendment  that  says  that  the
Costello  language  can  not  override  an  international  obligation  of
the  United  States.  I  imagine  Mr.  Costello  will  claim,  and  I  know
him  from  long  experience  working  closely  with  him,  and  we  are
very  good  friends,  but  he  will  claim,  probably,  that  this  amend-
ment, my second-degree amendment, would gut his amendment. If
that is so, then it just confirms that Mr. Costello’s language would
create  an  international  trade  incident,  which  may  hurt  the  United
States. If my language will not gut Mr. Costello’s effort, then there
is no reason not to pass it.

So  I  urge  passage  of  my  amendment,  which  will  balance  Mr.
Costello’s good intentions. Let me emphasize that. Good intentions.
But  we  also  have  to  match  that  with  our  obligation  to  ensure  that
the United States abides by its international commitments.
[The prepared statement of Chairman Boehlert follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERWOOD L. BOEHLERT

I  know  the  gentleman’s  amendment  is  well  intentioned.  And  none  of  us  would
argue with its ostensible purpose—to keep and create jobs in the U.S. I always say
that ‘‘jobs’’ is my favorite four-letter word.

But  here’s  the  problem  with  the  amendment.  In  many  ways,  it  runs  afoul  of  our
international  trade  obligations.  Specifically,  we  have  signed  treaties  in  which  we
and  the  other  signatories  agree  not  to  limit  most  government  procurements.  And
guess  why  we  do  that?  We  do  it  because  we  think  it  will  help  keep  and  create  jobs
in the U.S. by enabling U.S. companies to compete for government contracts abroad.
There’s no way to know for sure, but it’s perfectly likely that this amendment would
actually  cost  jobs  in  the  U.S.  by  preventing  U.S.  companies  from  winning  procure-
ment contracts overseas.

Moreover,  this  amendment  is  at  odds  with  our  international  obligations  and  pos-
sibly endangers American jobs even though no one can point to a particular problem
that this amendment is designed to resolve. Is there any indication that NOAA has
been loose with the taxpayers money by heedlessly sending money overseas? No.

This  amendment  is  a  well  meaning,  symbolic  expression  of  the  concern  we  all
have  with  outsourcing,  but  it’s  not  designed  to  combat  a  specific,  known  problem.
But  it  would  create  specific,  known  problems  by  conflicting  with  trade  agreements.
And  I  would  add  that  the  Administration  strenuously  objects  for  that  same  reason.
So,  I  will  offer  a  second-degree  amendment  that  says  that  the  Costello  language

cannot override an international obligation of the United States.

I  imagine  Mr.  Costello  will  claim  that  this  would  ‘‘gut’’  the  amendment.  If  that
is so, then it just confirms that Mr. Costello’s language will create an international
trade incident, which may hurt the U.S. If my language will not ‘‘gut’’ Mr. Costello’s
effort, then there’s no reason not to pass it.

So I urge passage of my amendment, which will balance Mr. Costello’s good inten-
tions with our obligation to ensure that the U.S. abides by its international commit-
ments.

Mr. COSTELLO. I would ask the Chair to yield.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  Chair  is  pleased  to  yield  to  his  good

friend and colleague.

Mr. COSTELLO. Mr. Chairman, let me respond, if I may. I was not
going  to  suggest  that  it  guts  my  amendment,  but  apparently  it
does.

Let me make a couple of points.
One,  you  make  the  point  of  a  foreign  country  or  someone  object-
ing  and  challenging  this  provision  because  of  the  international

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:18 Jan 02, 2007 Jkt 031026 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\109MAR~1\COMP\COMP.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

54

trade agreements that we have through the WTO. And I would just
suggest  that  this  committee  should  not  be  in  the  business  of  at-
tempting to protect trade agreements, and in fact, a provision such
as  this  that  we  are  offering  as  this  amendment  has  never  been
challenged  at  all  by  the  International  Trade  Commission.  There
has  not  been  a  foreign  country  ever  challenge  an  issue  with  the
U.S. Government to go to court over this issue before.

Number  two  is  let  me  suggest  that  we  have  offered  and  debated
several  amendments  to  other  bills  in  the  past,  and  the  Chair  has
been  very  protective  in  the  past  of  having  amendments  adopted
that would result in referring a bill from this committee to another
committee.  And  it—I  would  suggest  that—I  am  told  at  least  that
your  amendment  to  my  amendment  would,  in  fact,  result  in  this
bill being referred to the Ways and Means Committee.

So  I  would  just  raise  that  issue  and  last  say  that,  you  know,
Members  of  the  Committee  have  a  choice  today  regarding  NOAA.
And  the  choice  is,  with  exceptions,  with—giving  the  President  the
exception  that  if  it  is  in  the  interest  of  national  security,  NOAA
would  not  have  to  abide  by  this.  If  they  are  buying  products  now
that are only made outside of the United States, there would be an
exception. So I am—it is pretty clear to me that, you know, instead
of this committee protecting or trying to protect international trade
agreements  that  have  never  been  challenged  in  the  past  on  this
issue,  I  would  just  suggest  that  we  have  a  choice  to  make  today
and  that  is  we  can  either  protect  American  jobs  from  going  over-
seas through contracts and services or we can sit here and try and
protect  trade  agreements  that  I  think  many  of  us  do  not  support
to begin with.

But  I  would  ask  again  for  Members—for  their  support  of  my
amendment  and  to  respectfully  reject  the  Chairman’s  amendment.

And I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your time.
Chairman BOEHLERT. I am glad you noted respectfully.
Let  me—first  of  all,  let  me  just  say  before  we  proceed,  and  the
way  I  would  like  to  proceed,  I  will  just  respond  initially  briefly  to
you,  and  then  I  will  have  my  amendment  reported,  and  then  we
can continue the debate. Okay.

Our  advice  from  counsel  is  this  will  not  result  in  a  referral  to
Ways  and  Means  or  any  other  committee,  so  we  are  getting  con-
flicting advice on both sides. But be that as it may——

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Mr.  Chairman,  we  would  like  to  take  our  coun-

sel’s advice.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  don’t  blame  you,  but  guess  what,  I  have
got the advantage of sitting in the Chair. And my counsel is pretty
darn good. But we will get some clarification on that, too.

The Clerk will report——
Ms. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—the amendment to the amendment.
Ms. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  We  are  going  to—here  is  what  we  are
going  to  do.  She  is  going  to  report,  and  then  we  will  have  further
discussion.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the  amend-
ment be considered as read, and so the Chair is recognized for five
minutes. We will continue this.

Ms. Biggert, you are next.
Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I move to strike the last word.
I have just a couple of points.
First of all, to the—to Mr. Costello’s amendment, I have concerns
when  he  talks  about  we  will  let  the  courts  decide  and  it  can  al-
ways—or  that  we  are  protecting  international  trade  agreements.
We are not protecting international trade agreements. Trade agree-
ments  are  a  legal,  binding  contract  on  the  United  States  and  all
of  the  other  countries  involved,  and  we  can’t  protect  them,  but  we
really  have  to  make  sure  that  our  actions  do  not  violate  the  law.
Second  of  all,  the  grandfathering  in  those  contracts  with  others
right  now,  I  think  that  locks  us  into  an  old  technology  that  if  we
can  not  make  new  agreements  with  other  countries  who  might
have  the  quality  of  goods  that  we  need  that  the  United  States
doesn’t need and we have grandfathered them in, then they are not
going  to  be  able  to  proceed  with—we  can’t  go  to  another  country
with—that has better technology and that we don’t have. So I have
concerns just with the way that that is written.

Second  of  all,  with  the  proposed  secondary  amendment,  I  think
that  that  helps  to  overcome  the  legality  of  trade  agreements.  My
only  concern  with  the  secondary  amendment  is  that  it  doesn’t  say
who  is  going  to  decide.  And  in  most  cases  like  this,  there  usually
is  a  provision  as—that  USTR  will  be  the  deciding  body  whether—
you know, whether that would violate the trade agreement whether
to be able to go ahead or not.

So  with  that,  I  think  there  is  a  little  bit  of  the  language  that
would  need  to  be  looked  at  if  we  decide  to  go  with  the  secondary
amendment.

And with that, I yield back.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Is there anyone—Ms. Jackson Lee has departed.
Mr. Gutknecht.
Mr. GUTKNECHT. Mr. Chairman, I am going to vote for your per-
fecting amendment here, but I do want to congratulate Mr. Costello
for  bringing  this  issue  forward.  And  for  those  of  you  who  have
never  been  out  to  NOAA’s  headquarters  out  in  Colorado,  I  would
encourage you to make a trip out there. And after I was out there,
I  came  back  believing  that  this  was  an  agency  that  not  only  had
a point of view, but was willing to do whatever it took to prove that
particular point of view. And that was discouraging for me.

But  I  also  want  to  say  this.  It  is  also  discouraging  to  me  that  a
lot  of  our  partners  around  the  world  are  more  than  eager  to  allow
the  United  States  to  shoulder  90  percent  of  the  cost  of  doing  re-
search  of  this  type  and  then  have  little  to  offer  except  criticism  of
the  United  States.  And  so  this  may  be  a  ham-fisted  way  to  make
a  point,  but  I  think  it  is  an  important  point  that  Congress  needs
to make.

And  I  guess  if  you  boiled  it  all  down,  it  comes  to  this:  he  who
pays,  plays.  And  a  lot  of  our  trading  partners  in  Europe  and  in
other  parts  of  the  world,  who  are  supposedly  our  allies,  will—are

56

not  willing  to  put  up  much  money  in  terms  of  doing  this  kind  of
research  but  they  are  constantly  critical  of  the  United  States  for
not doing enough. And so this may not be the perfect way to make
a  statement  to  some  of  our  friends  around  the  world,  but  at  least
it is an attempt.

I will vote for the Chairman’s perfecting amendment, but I would
encourage all Members to pay very close attention not only to what
NOAA is up to but sometimes to what our friends are up to as well.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Ms. Jackson Lee.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the Chairman very much.
I wish my colleagues would look specifically at Mr. Costello’s lan-
guage, and I think it is, if anything, leans toward absolute fairness.
It  particularly  talks  about  procurement.  It  talks  about  contractors
and subcontractors located outside of the United States. Time after
time, Members have voted for this very same language on the Floor
of  the  House.  I  hate  to  use  the  term  ‘‘buy  American’’  to  defend
someone,  but  I  think  part  of  the  connection  of  Mr.  Costello’s  lan-
guage  and  intent,  and  I  don’t  want  to  read  my  analysis  into  his
language,  but  over  and  over  again,  we  talk  about  building  the
science capacity, technology capacity here in the United States, the
number of scholars that we can generate to begin to foster a great-
er  involvement  in  this  work.  NOAA  is  a  scientific  entity.  Albeit,  it
deals  with  our  weather  predictions  and  other  scientific  efforts.
What Mr. Costello is doing is even more far-reaching than the con-
cept  of  ‘‘buy  American.’’  It  is  investing  in  America.  I  think  he
makes  provisions  if  it  is  to  the  necessity  of  national  security  that
he provides an exemption.

And I am concerned, though I appreciate the intent of the Chair-
man’s amendment, I am concerned that this throws this particular
legislation  into  Ways  and  Means,  which  has  jurisdiction  over  trea-
ties. And this doesn’t speak—he does not speak specifically to trea-
ties,  and  by  its  silence,  I  think  that  this  legislation  can  track  and
parallel the obligations of a treaty. What it says, where NOAA can,
abiding by law, use the services and goods from within the United
States,  goods  and  services  from  the  United  States,  they  should  do
it. Why should we be against that? All of the protections are in the
amendment.

And I would hope that we would see this two-fold: one, investing
in America, and three, investing in America’s human resources, in-
vesting  in  America’s  small  businesses,  investing  in  America’s  tech-
nology, investing in America’s science.

I  hope  my  colleagues  will  support  the  amendment,  and  I  yield

Thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Before  going  to  Mr.  Hall,  I  just  want  it  known  that  the  Parlia-
mentarian’s  office  has  confirmed  that  this  will—my  substitute
amendment,  second-degree  amendment,  will  not  trigger  a  referral
to Ways and Means, so let us strike that from your thinking.

Mr. Hall.
Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
You  know,  the  lady  from  Texas  was  absolutely  correct  in  saying
it is not an unfair thrust, but I was a judge for 12 years, and most

57

of  them  I  ran  into  wanted  a  favorable  treatment  more  than  they
wanted fair treatment. And I think from the manner that you had
with  Mr.  Costello  evidences  the  respect  that  you  have  for  one  an-
other.

But actually, ‘‘buy American’’ is a wonderful thrust and one that
we  have  all  supported  and  voted—all  of  us  have  voted  for  it  many
times in many shapes and in many forms. And I read this amend-
ment  over  and  looked  at  it  with  my  advisor  in  my  office.  And  my
thought  was  if  there  is  some  way  that  the  U.S.  could  get  last
chance  at  any  underseller  or  underbuyer,  and  I  don’t  know  what
your amendment does, but I would like something like that.

Mr.  Chairman,  you  put  it  to  him  pretty  hard.  If  it  harms,  it
should  harm,  and  if  it  doesn’t  harm,  there  is  no  damage  done.  I
will—you are going to explain your amendment, aren’t you, a little
more fully, your amendment to his amendment?

Chairman BOEHLERT. I already did.
Mr. HALL. And—well——
Chairman BOEHLERT. Do you want me to repeat?
No, I mean, as the fact—look, we are not——
Mr. HALL. Well, maybe you could just talk louder for some of us
older  people.  You  know,  your  statement  to  the  gentleman  who  has
the  amendment,  Mr.  Costello,  is  a  lot  like  a  guy  standing  in  front
of a judge in Texas that is about to condemn him to death and ex-
plained his actions, how horrible they were and how many children
that  the  deceased  left  and  what  painful  death  it  was  for  him,  and
he  says,  ‘‘Now  do  you  have  anything  to  say  before  I  sentence  you
to  death?’’  And  he  says,  ‘‘No,  sir.  Under  the  circumstances,  I  feel
like I am getting off pretty light.’’

So I don’t know if Mr. Costello feels that way or not, but I want
to  vote  for  his  amendment,  but  I  am  going  to  support  your  cor-
recting  amendment,  if  it  corrects  the  amendment.  If  it  doesn’t  cor-
rect  the  amendment,  it  shouldn’t  correct  the  amendment.  That  is
taking a page out of your book.

I yield back.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
And  you  just,  once  again,  gave  us  testimony  to  why  it  is  such  a

delight to have you serving on this committee.

This—let  me  just  say  that  this  is  unlike  past  ‘‘buy  American’’
amendments,  which  did  not  supersede  trade  agreements.  What  we
are saying with my language is that the Costello language can not
override  an  international  obligation  of  the  United  States.  You
know,  I  have  been  in  the  ranks  with  all  of  us  here.  We  all  have
the same general intent. We want everybody to buy American. But
we  have  some  international  agreements  that  have  been  entered
into,  and  you  know,  we  want  to—we  don’t  want  to  override  those
international agreements based on this amendment.

So with that, let us see, who is next up? Mr. Miller.
Mr. MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Will  the  Chairman,  as  the  author  of  the  second-degree  amend-

ment, yield to a question or two?

Chairman BOEHLERT. Will I yield or will——
Mr. MILLER. Yes.
Mr.  Chairman,  do  you  agree  with  Mr.  Costello  that  there  is  not
now  any  clear  provision  of  treaty  or  any  clear  ruling  of  law  that

58

would  apply  to  this  amendment  to  make  it  either  permissible  or
not permissible under the WTO or any other trade agreement?

Chairman BOEHLERT. Yeah.
Mr. MILLER. You do agree with that?
Chairman BOEHLERT. The answer is essentially yes.
Mr.  MILLER.  But  it  is—okay.  So  then  who  would  decide  whether
this  was  consistent  or  not?  Would  it  simply  be  the  Administration
that  would  decide,  and  if  so,  what  would  be—on  what  basis  would
they decide?

Mr. COSTELLO. If the gentleman would yield while the Chairman

is conferring, would you yield?

Mr. MILLER. I do yield.
Mr. COSTELLO. That is my whole point.
Mr. MILLER. Right.
Mr.  COSTELLO.  My  whole  point  in  the  issue  with  the—when  we
are  talking  about  international  trade  agreements,  and  my  friend
from Illinois made the point, I would tell you that, in my judgment,
it  is  not  clear  what  our  international  trade  obligations  are  under
the WTO treaties. And number two, you know, are we going to in-
terpret  treaties  here,  in  this  committee,  or  are  we  going  to  leave
it up to the courts or the International Trade Association to deter-
mine what treaties are violated and what treaties are not violated?
And  I  would  just  leave  you  with  this  thought.  Are  we  going  to
be  cautious  about  trying  to  protect  trade  agreements  where  we  do
not even know, as we sit here today, if this violates a trade agree-
ment?  I  would  just  say,  as  opposed  to  being  cautious  about  trade
agreements,  we  ought  to  be  aggressive  about  protecting  American
jobs.

Mr. MILLER. Mr. Costello, it did occur to me that my line of ques-

tioning might actually help the point you were making.

Mr. COSTELLO. And I thank the gentleman for that.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  but  let  me  just  say
we  do  know  that  this  would  violate  existing  trade  agreement,  and
what  would  happen  under  the  WTO?  And  it  would  be  NOAA,  in
consultation  with  the  U.S.  Trade  Representative,  that  would  give
us guidance and make the initial interpretation.

We  are  not  going  to  get  into  the  treaty  business  here  in  the
House. I agree with you on that. But we are involved in a number
of treaties, and it seems that we are obligated, under the provisions
of those treaties, to honor them, and we don’t want to do anything
that  would  be  in  violation  that  would  trigger  an  action  by  WTO.
Mr.  MILLER.  I  am  sorry.  Was  that  in  answer  to  the  question  of

who decides and on what basis?

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The—NOAA,  in  consultation
with  USTR,  and  incidentally,  WTO  procurement  agreement  would
be violated. The CRS review determined that.

Mr. MILLER. Okay. My third—actually, I have just a couple more

questions, if I am not——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Have at it.
Mr. MILLER. All right. Thank you, sir.
Mr.  Chairman,  do  you  agree  with  Ms.  Biggert’s  point  that  Con-
gress  can  not  exempt  this  from  WTO,  or  any  other  trade  agree-
ment, anyway?

Chairman BOEHLERT. Restate your question, please.

Mr.  MILLER.  I  believe  Ms.  Biggert  made  the  point  that  we  can-
not—Mr.  Costello’s  amendment  could  not  exempt  NOAA’s  procure-
ment from WTO requirements anyway. Is that—do you agree with
that? Do you agree with Ms. Biggert?

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Yeah,  but  then  there  is  no  reason  to  op-

pose my amendment.

Mr.  MILLER.  But  then  that  also  raises  the  question  of  whether
it is necessary or whether it is redundant, not that redundancy has
ever been particularly a political sin. We would all be in deep trou-
ble were it.

Mr.  GORDON.  Would  my  friend  from  North  Carolina  yield?  I

think I can maybe sum this up.

Mr. MILLER. All right.
Mr.  GORDON.  The—in  my  opinion,  in  my  legal  opinion,  the  fact
of  the  matter  is,  we  can  not,  through  this  committee,  pass  some
type  of  law  that  would  make  us  be  in  non-compliance  with  an
international treaty. So, I mean, you know, we can’t do that.

And  so  here  is  the  practical  part  of  this.  There  is  a  lot  of  gray
area  in  this  law,  and  what—and  this  amendment,  or  this—by  put-
ting  this  secondary  amendment,  it  really  puts  us  into  a  burden  of
proof  situation.  In  other  words,  we  can’t  pass  a  law  that  says  that
we are going to be in violation of an international treaty. But—that
is  very  vague.  And  so  what  this  amendment  would  do,  secondary
amendment would do, it would put the—really the burden of proof
on leaning more toward the international treaties than it would on
leaning  toward  trying  to  be  aggressive  and  protecting  American
jobs.

So it is really dealing in that gray area, and the kind of message
you are going to send out, it is—under no circumstances are we in
this Science Committee going to pass a law that would allow us to
violate an international treaty.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Yeah, and it——
Mr. GORDON. And I yield back.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  we  are  not  the  people  who  are  going
to  sit  in  judgment.  It  is  going  to  be  the  Administrator  of  NOAA  in
consultation  with  U.S.  Trade  Representative.  We  are  not  getting
into that business.

Mr. MILLER. Mr. Chairman, I did have one more question.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Who else seeks recognition?
Mr. MILLER. Actually, could I just ask——
Chairman BOEHLERT. Ms. Johnson.
Mr. MILLER. I guess I can’t ask one more?
Chairman BOEHLERT. Your time is expired now.
Ms. Johnson.
Ms.  JOHNSON OF TEXAS.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  yield  to

Mr. Costello before me.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The gentleman is recognized.
Mr. COSTELLO. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. And I would—
you know, we could sit here for the next half-hour and go back and
forth  on  this  issue,  but  I  think  it  is  pretty  clear.  The  Chairman
stated  it  just  a  second  ago.  We  are  not  going  to  get  into  the  busi-
ness  of  determining  international  treaties  in  this  committee.  But
any  time  that  we  can  try  and  protect  American  jobs,  we  should.
And  if,  in  fact,  this,  at  some  point  in  time,  that  it  is  determined

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:18 Jan 02, 2007 Jkt 031026 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\109MAR~1\COMP\COMP.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

60

that  it  is  a  violation  of  an  international  trade  agreement,  which  I
doubt very seriously that it is, then we can come back and address
that. But today, we ought to be protecting American jobs.

And I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.
Mr. MILLER. Thank you.
I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. I have one more question for you.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Why am I not surprised?
The gentleman will ask the question.
Mr. MILLER. All of the discussion so far, Mr. Chairman, has been
about jobs and about buying American. But does this not also allow
the contracting outside the United States of services? Are we going
to  be  building  scientific  expertise  somewhere  other  than  here?  Of
course,  I  prefer  to  buy  American  goods,  but  I  am  particularly  con-
cerned about building scientific expertise in the United States, not
somewhere else.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  We  don’t  have  any  problem  with  Sub-
section  A  of  the  amendment.  Get  the  amendment.  Read  it.  What
my  second-degree  amendment  simply  says,  and  I  will  repeat,  ‘‘can
not override an international obligation of the United States.’’

Mr. MILLER. Right.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  That  is  not  the  responsibility  of  the
Science  Committee  to  determine.  That  is  the  responsibility  of  the
Administrator  of  NOAA  in  consultation  with  the  World—with  the
U.S. Trade Representative of any Administration.

Who else seeks recognition?
Ms. Biggert.
Ms. BIGGERT. Let me just take that one step further.
The  reason  that  it  is  so  important  that  we  have  this  secondary
amendment is because if we don’t, and there is a—we are cited by
the—and  it  goes  to  court  to  decide,  then  what  happens  is  that  the
World  Trade  Organization  will,  if  they  say  yes  we  are  in  violation
of  a  trade  agreement,  then  they  can  sanction  us.  And  it  doesn’t
mean that they are going to sanction NOAA or anything. They can
sanction  any  product  in  our—in  this  country,  like,  say,  agriculture
or  financial  services,  anything.  And  so  it  is  so  important  that  we
make this decision prior to going to court. And that is why it is so
important  that  it  is  with  NOAA  and  with  the  USTR  to  give  us  an
opinion  before  this  is  done  whether  it  would  be  a  violation  or  not.
Mr.  COSTELLO.  And  I  wonder  if  my  friend  from  Illinois  would

yield?

The  point  that  I  have  made,  as  I  am  trying  to  make,  is  that,  to
my  knowledge,  and  staff  has  informed  me,  that  there  has  never
been a challenge to a ‘‘buy American’’ agreement through the World
Trade  Organization.  So  there  is  not  a  ruling  by  a  court,  there  is
not a ruling by anyone on any of these issues. And what I am say-
ing is, at some point in time, we have to stand up and say enough
is enough. And we have to begin to protect American jobs.

Now this is not an amendment that says that NOAA can not con-
tract out for services, can not contract out for other goods to foreign
countries or to foreign labor. There are exceptions. If the President
determines that it is in the interest of national security or if there
are  products  that  are  only  made  outside  of  the  United  States  that
can not be obtained here in the country, or if, in fact, the goods are
being  made  by  U.S.  workers  in  other  countries,  those  exceptions

61

are  clear  in  the  amendment.  And  I  would  say,  you  know,  at  some
point  in  time,  we  need  to  not  be  so  concerned  about  protecting  a
gray area in an international trade agreement and start protecting
jobs here at home.

Ms. BIGGERT. If I might reclaim my time.
We  also  have  to  be  protective  of  our  legal  obligations  and  to
make sure that those are not violated. I just think it is one more—
all  of  your  exceptions  are  very  good.  Your  premise  is  very  good  of
buying American, but this one makes it even better.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  And  I  would  say  that  the  courts  are  there  for  a
reason, that we shouldn’t be—we are the Judicial Branch. They are
the Judicial Branch, we are the Legislative Branch, but the branch
that will determine this will be the Judicial Branch, not the Legis-
lative  Branch,  and  if  we  are  going—every  action  that  we  take,  if
we  are  going  to  be  concerned  that  it  is  going  to  be  overruled  by  a
court,  you  know,  I  don’t  think  we  would  ever  get  anything  done
around here.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  I  don’t  think  that  we  are  worried  about  whether
what  we  are  doing  is  legal  under  the  WTO.  And  this  is  a  global
economy, and we are participating.

I yield back.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
And thank you.
Ms. JOHNSON OF TEXAS. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Ms. Johnson.
Ms. JOHNSON OF TEXAS. Just one more, I guess, comment.
If  we  get  too  over  concerned  about  the  language  of  the  treaties
and not allow the appropriate ones to get concern, it—then I would
like  to  explore  what  our  treaty  says  with  China,  because  appar-
ently  they  have  an  open-ended  agreement,  if  we  are  going  to  get
into  treaty  agreements,  because  they  certainly  don’t  respect  any  of
our guidelines.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  was  just  advised  by  the  distinguished
Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Science  Committee  that  China  is  not  part  of
WTO  and  therefore—the  procurement  agreement,  and  therefore  it
wouldn’t apply.

But  just  let  me  say  this  in  summing  up  everything.  I  must  ad-
mire  the  skill  of  the  gentleman  from  Illinois’  presentation.  I  agree
with the rhetoric, but not the reasoning. The rhetoric is something
we  can  all  identify  with.  We  are  all  anxious  to  do  as  much  as  we
can  to  protect  American  jobs.  That  is  the  desire  of  every  single
Member of this panel, no matter where he or she may sit.

But it is also the intent of this committee not to go forward with
anything that would be in violation of existing commitments of the
United  States  of  America.  And  the  Costello  Amendment  violates
the WTO procurement agreement on its face, according to the Con-
gressional  Research  Service,  a  highly-regarded  operation,  CRS,
non-partisan. We need my language, because the Costello language
goes  further  in  contradicting  trade  agreements  than  past  ‘‘buy
American’’ language does.

Chairman BOEHLERT. So with that, the vote will be on——
Mr. GORDON. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Yes.
Mr.  GORDON.  I  know  we  have  got  to  finish  this  thing  up,  and  I

will try to be quick.

Once  again,  we  can’t  pass  legislation  here  that  is  going  to  be  in
violation  of  an  international  treaty,  so  we  can  all,  you  know,  go
home comfortable about that tonight.

Let  me  tell  you  how  it  really  can  make  a  difference.  I  had—I
have  got—the  school  in  my  hometown  is  called  Middle  Tennessee
State  University,  and  they  have  got  a  very  good  dyslexia  center
there.  And  they  have  done  some  work  on  treating  dyslexia  and
treating—and  also  with  distant  learning  in  trying  to  help  teachers
around the state learn how to treat people with dyslexia. So I was
persuasive  and  had  $1  million  put  in  the  Defense  budget  for—so
we could do the same sort of thing with our military schools around
the  Nation—around  the  world  to  try  to  help—you  know,  teach
those teachers how to deal with dyslexic students. And what wound
up  happening—and  parochially,  I  will  admit,  my  university  was  a
good  one,  and  so  I  was  thinking  they  were  going  to  get  this  bid.
But instead, what happened, it—there was a little company in New
Jersey that had a front there who got the bid and then shipped ev-
erything to India to be done.

And  I  think  this  amendment  would  have  given  the  Defense  De-
partment  or  NOAA  or  someone  else  the  ability,  you  know,  to  take
that back. And so I mean, I think this is the kind of—the real war,
it  is  really  where  are  you  going  to  put  the  burden  of  proof.  And  I
think that is what Mr. Costello does is puts the burden of proof on
keeping the jobs here.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much for reminding me of
the  outstanding  work  being  done  at  Middle  Tennessee  State  Uni-
versity.

And let me, on behalf of all of us, congratulate you on your abil-
ity to get $1 million earmark in the DOD bill. We are all wondering
how you achieved that.

But I would point out that the procurement agreement allows for

exceptions for Defense.

And so with that, I think we have pretty much exhausted it.
The  vote  is  on  the  amendment  to  the  amendment.  If—all  in

favor, say aye. Opposed, no. The ayes appear to have it.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  ask  for  a  recorded  vote.

ably  report  H.R.  50,  as  amended,  to  the  House  with  the  rec-
ommendation  that  the  bill,  as  amended,  do  pass.  Furthermore,  I
move  that  staff  be  instructed  to  prepare  the  legislative  report  and
make  necessary  technical  and  conforming  changes  and  that  the
Chairman  take  all  necessary  steps  to  bring  the  bill  before  the
House for consideration.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The question is on the motion to report the
bill,  as  amended,  favorably.  Those  in  favor  of  the  motion  will  sig-
nify  by  saying  aye.  Opposed,  no.  The  ayes  have  it,  and  the  bill  is
favorably reported.

Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
I  move  that  Members  have  two  subsequent  calendar  days  in
which to submit supplemental, minority, or additional views on the
measure.  I  would  move  pursuant  to  Clause  1  of  Rule  22  of  the
Rules  of  the  House  of  Representatives  that  the  Committee  author-
izes the Chairman to offer such motions as may be necessary in the
House  to  adopt  and  pass  H.R.  50,  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric  Administration  Act,  as  amended.  Without  objection,  so  or-
dered.

I want to thank everybody for participating and for your attend-

ance and indulgence.
