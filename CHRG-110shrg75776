THE  STATE  OF  BROADBAND  IN  ARKANSAS 

TUESDAY,  AUGUST  28,  2007 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10  a.m.,  in  the  Main 
Library  of  the  President  Clinton  Presidential  Library,  100  Rock 
Street, Little Rock, Arkansas, Hon. Mark Pryor, presiding. 
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

U.S. SENATE, 

Little Rock, AR. 

Senator PRYOR. Let me go ahead and, since I don’t have a gavel, 
oh, wait—I’ll use my BlackBerry. Let me thank everyone for being 
here.  This  is  an  official  hearing  of  the  Senate  Commerce  Com-
mittee. And I want to thank Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman 
Stevens for allowing us to do this in Little Rock today. And let me 
just thank all of the participants. 

You  all  notice  that  we  have  a  very  large  panel  of  witnesses,  and 
that  really  underscores  the  importance  of  broadband.  When  we 
start  talking  about  this,  maybe,  you  think,  hey,  we’re  going  to 
have,  you  know,  a  few  phone  companies  or  a  few  of  this  or  a  few 
of that, but the truth is that broadband touches so many people in 
so  many  different  ways  that  once  we  really  got  into  this,  we  real-
ized  we  needed  a  very  broad  spectrum  of  input.  One  of  the  goals 
today  is  just  for—to  allow  the  United  States  Senate  through  the 
Commerce  Committee  to  hear  about  some  of  the  challenges  and 
some  of  the  successes  in  trying  to  get  broadband  out  to  a  rural 
state,  some  of  the  work  that  has  been  accomplished,  and  some  of 
the work that is still left to do. 

And also it’s a great honor to have two FCC commissioners here 
with  us  today.  It  is  unusual  for  any  state  or  any  city  to  be  able  to 
host  two  commissioners  at  the  same  time.  These  gentlemen  are 
very, very busy. The FCC has a very, very full plate. The industries 
here that are represented, that have business before the FCC, they 
understand  how  many  things  are  going  on  at  the  Federal  Commu-
nications Commission. And to have two commissioners here to take 
time  out  of  their  schedule,  I  really  appreciate  that.  And  they’ve 
been  bragging,  just  to  let  you  know—they’ve  been  bragging  on  Ar-
kansas  and  on  Little  Rock  for  really  rolling  out  the  red  carpet  for 
them.  So  I  want  to  thank  everyone  for  that  and  being  very,  very 
gracious hosts and hostesses for them. 

I  want  to  thank  everyone  here  for  helping  us  examine  the  state 
of broadband in Arkansas. In some ways, Arkansas is a microcosm 
of  the  country,  because  we  have  some  areas  that  are  urban,  say

Little Rock and some of the more densely-populated areas. We have 
lots  of  small  towns,  as  you  all  know.  And  then  we  have  a  big  per-
centage of people in this state that actually live outside of city lim-
its  and  live  out  in  counties.  And  so  we  get  the  full  range  of  chal-
lenges  when  it  comes  to  broadband.  But  I  will  say,  we’ve  come  a 
long  way  in  a  short  time.  Last  night,  we  went  to  the  Clinton  Li-
brary,  and  one  of  the  alcoves  is  devoted  to  technology.  And  you 
could  see  the  progress  that  was  made  in  the  1990s  when  it  comes 
to technology, but we have made so much more progress since then. 
This  is  a  very  rapidly  changing  and  rapidly  moving  development 
for our country. In little more than a decade, broadband technology 
has evolved really from just its roots for computer enthusiasts into 
a  broadly-used  platform  that  is  now  the  foundation  of  communica-
tions and commerce in the Information Age. Today broadband tech-
nology is driving innovation in fields like telemedicine—we’re going 
to hear that today, helping to provide quality health care in remote 
parts  of  our  Nation.  It’s  transforming  education,  allowing  our  chil-
dren  to  access  ideas  and  information  far  beyond  what  the  shelves 
of any school or public library might be able to hold. 

In fact, this morning, I went to a convenience store, and the store 
clerk  knew  we  were  having  this  hearing  today.  And  she  told  me 
that  she  lives  in  rural  Pulaski  County,  which  is  this  county  we’re 
in right now, and that all they have is dial-up and that she home- 
schools. And it is very, very hard for her to access the information 
that  they  need  and  they  want  to  home-school  their  children.  And 
so the point of that is, there are just so many applications. It’s real-
ly  endless  the  applications  that  broadband  can  have  in  the  way  it 
impacts  people.  And  it’s  transforming  our  workforce,  increasing 
productivity,  creating  new  economic  opportunities  for  consumers 
and  businesses.  In  fact,  you  all  probably  heard  me  tell  this  story 
before, because I’ve told it several times. But up in north Arkansas, 
there  is  a  little  mom  and  pop  fishing  resort  that  was  teetering  on 
having to go out of business, because it just didn’t have enough vol-
ume  to  keep  the  doors  open.  And  the  local  phone  company,  which 
is a small phone company up there, a few years ago said, ‘‘hey, let 
us design a website, we’ll get you some high-speed Internet access, 
and  let’s  see  what  happens.’’  And  it  has  totally  transformed  their 
business. 

Now,  you  have  to  book  them  a  year  in  advance,  but  it’s  because 
of the interconnectivity of all that. For people who like to trout fish 
and like to small mouth bass fish, they can now come to Arkansas. 
It’s not—not only creating jobs, but showcasing our state. 

But  with  all  this  promise  that  we’re  talking  about  here,  and  all 
the  upside,  over  the  past  seven  years,  the  U.S.  as  a  nation  has 
dropped  from  number  four  to  number  fifteen  in  the  world 
broadband rankings. Closer to home here in Arkansas, even though 
it’s  very,  very  difficult  to  know  exactly  where  Arkansas  stands  be-
cause of the way statistics are kept, but under the current method 
of  keeping  statistics,  Arkansas  is  47th  out  of  50  states  in 
broadband  penetration.  So  I  know  that  there  is  a  serious  commit-
ment  with  the  governor,  with  the  legislature,  with  all  the  elected 
officials, and the business community to try to move Arkansas for-
ward.  And  that’s  what  we  are  trying  to  do.  Arkansas  like  many 
other  parts  of  the  Nation—we  need  to  go  further,  we  need  to  go 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:23 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\GPO\DOCS\75776.TXT JACKIE

faster, and we need to ensure that all Americans can reap the ben-
efits of a robust and also affordable broadband technology.

So there are a lot of people in this room who have been working 
on this, some for a short time, some for a long time. Hopefully, to-
day’s hearing will help us clarify issues that are important, and we 
will keep in mind that common goal of making Arkansas the leader 
in broadband deployment, and the spreading of the benefits of this 
technology to all of our citizens. 

So now, let me introduce our two Federal Communications Com-
missioners,  that’s  Michael  Copps  and  Jonathan  Adelstein.  Let  me 
start  with  Commissioner  Copps.  He’s  a  leader  in  seeking  deploy-
ment  of  affordable  broadband  throughout  America.  He  was  one  of 
the first to call for a national broadband strategy. In addition, most 
of  you  know  him  as  a  champion  for  consumers,  because  he’s  been 
working  on  those  issues  for  a  long,  long  time.  He  has  a  very  im-
pressive  public  service  career.  He’s  served  at  the  FCC  since  2001. 
Under  the  Clinton  Administration,  Commissioner  Copps  served  as 
Assistant  Secretary  of  Commerce  for  Trade  Development  at  the 
U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  and  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of 
Commerce  for  Basic  Industries.  The  Commissioner  came  to  Wash-
ington  in  1970,  joining  the  staff  of  Senator  Ernest  ‘‘Fritz’’  Hollings 
of  South  Carolina,  and  serving  for  over  a  dozen  years  as  his  Chief 
of Staff. 

Commissioner  Adelstein  is  an  old  friend  of  the  Pryor  family.  He 
worked for my father on the Senate Aging Committee. And he was 
born  in  South  Dakota,  and  he  is  very—that  makes  him  very,  very 
aware of some of the challenges that rural providers face when try-
ing  to  deploy  broadband  out  in  remote  areas.  And  also  there  is  a 
closely-guarded  secret  about  him  that  I’ll  let  you  in  on.  He  was  a 
roommate at one point of our Lieutenant Governor, Bill Halter. So 
if  we  need  the  scoop  on  Bill  Halter,  we  have  the  resource  right 
here—and  it  may  go  both  ways,  though.  But  he  was  sworn  in  as 
a  member  of  the  FCC  on  December  3,  2002,  and  he  was  sworn  in 
for  a  new  five-year  term  on  December  6,  2004.  Before  joining  the 
FCC, he was in the Senate in terms of staff, and maybe committee 
staff  or  personal  staff,  in  the  Senate  for  about  15  years.  He  used 
to  work  with  Senator  Daschle,  and  my  father,  Senator  Reid,  and 
Senator  Don  Riegle,  so  he  has  a  long  experience  in  Washington, 
so—Commissioner Copps, if you want to lead off—well, what we’re 
going  to  do  here  is  we’re  going  to  give  them  five  to  ten  minutes 
each, and then we’ll introduce the panel. 

STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL J. COPPS, COMMISSIONER, 

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 

Commissioner  COPPS.  Well,  thank  you,  Senator,  for  that  nice  in-
troduction,  I  don’t  get  to  be  on  this  side  of  the  table  of  the  Senate 
hearings  very  often.  It’s  not  bad.  I  think  I  like  it.  But  I  am  happy 
to  be  here  for  many  reasons.  First,  as  the  Senator  said,  I  worked 
in  the  Senate  for  many  years,  and  getting  to  spend  some  quality 
time  with  the  leaders  of  the  Senate  office,  something  I  jump  at 
doing,  especially  with  someone  like  Senator  Pryor  who  epitomizes 
the  best  of  the  Senate  in  terms  of  understanding  the  issues  that 
confront  Arkansas,  the  issues  that  confront  the  country,  and  then

in  knowing  the  Pryor  family  tradition,  how  to  work  with  his  col-
leagues and to cross the aisle to get good things done. 

So  I’m  happy  to  be  here  for  that  reason.  We  had  a  wonderful 
evening, and thanks to the hospitality of a lot of folks in this audi-
ence  last  night  at  the  Clinton  Library,  and  having  worked  in  the 
Clinton  Administration,  and  that  brought  back  a  lot  of  memories 
for me, and meant a lot to me, so I am very grateful for that. 

Last  night,  I  was  thinking  about  that  ‘‘don’t  stop  thinking  about 
tomorrow’’ that we were all singing about back in 1993. And really, 
that’s  what  this  hearing  is  all  about.  It’s  about  tomorrow.  Where 
are  we  heading  in  this  still  new  21st  century,  and  what  role  are 
telecommunications  going  to  play  in  charting  our  future?  And  my 
answer  to  that  is  that  they  are  going  to  play  an  absolutely  huge 
role, and that the future is going to belong to those who learn best 
how to deploy these new technologies and services, and my answer 
is  also  that  we  have  to  get  this  right  for  America.  And  part  of  my 
answer  unfortunately  is  that  right  now,  we’re  not  quite  where  we 
need to be. And I know we’ve got a lot of new gizmos and gadgets, 
and  advanced  telecommunications  like  broadband  have  already 
brought  us  some  pretty  fundamental  changes  right  here  in  Arkan-
sas, too, thanks to the efforts of a lot of you folks in this room. 

But I also know as the Senator has said that other countries are 
eating  our  lunch  in  getting  high-speed  telecommunications  out  to 
their  citizens  and  building  their  communications  infrastructure. 
And  I  believe  that  our  country  at  the  national  level—its  lack  of  a 
concerned strategy to get broadband out to all of our people is like 
playing Russian roulette with our future. We’ve got to do better in 
getting telecommunications out to all of our people. And when I say 
that ‘‘all,’’ I always underline that word, because that means every-
body.  We  can’t  afford  to  leave  anybody  behind  in  this  new  age  of 
high-speed  communications.  And  that  means  those  who  live  in 
rural  America,  those  who  live  in  the  inner  city,  those  who  live  on 
tribal  lands.  It  means  not  just  the  affluent  and  the  privileged,  but 
it  means  those  who  are  economically  disadvantaged  and  people 
with disabilities. Each and every citizen of this country has to have 
access to the windows of communication. And I’m not talking about 
that  from  some  kind  of  ‘‘social  do-gooder’’  kind  of  perspective.  I’m 
talking  about  not  doing—I’m  talking  about  doing  America  a  favor. 
That’s—that’s  what  we’ve  got  to  look  at  this  as.  I’m  talking  about 
making  sure  that  our  citizens  have  the  wherewithal  to  compete  in 
this  highly-competitive  global  economy  that  we’re  in.  I’m  talking 
about potential small business success stories right here in Arkan-
sas  that  aren’t  going  to  happen—that  are  not  going  to  happen  un-
less we wake up now and get a national strategy. 

I  think  broadband  is  really  the  great  infrastructure  challenge  of 
our  time.  And  if  you  course  back  through  the  annals  of  America’s 
past,  it’s—every  generation  seems  to  have  some  kind  of  a  infra-
structure  challenge.  We  go  back  to  when  we  settled  this  country. 
And  the  first  job  was,  well,  how  do  we  get  the  produce  and  the 
products of the settlers to market. So we found a way as a country, 
government  and  business  working  together,  to  build  roads  and 
turnpikes  and  regional  railroads  and  canals  and  harbors  and  all 
the rest. Then after the Civil War, we’re all of a sudden a big conti-
nental  nation.  How  do  you  bind  that  nation  together?  Again,  we

found  a  way.  Government  and  business  and  communities  working 
together  to  build  the  transcontinental  railroads.  Even  in  our  own 
time,  we  had  the  interstate  highway  system  to  bring  cities,  sub-
urbs, and country together. 

And  my  point  is—first  of  all,  in  all  of  these  great  infrastructure 
build-outs,  there  has  always  been  a  critical  role  for  having  a  na-
tional strategy and then having government and business and com-
munities work together. We didn’t just throw up our hands and say 
‘‘let  somebody  else  do  it’’  or  ‘‘the  market  itself  is  going  to  accom-
plish  all  of  this  stuff.’’  We  work  together.  That’s  really  how  we’ve 
built the United States of America. And to me, the broadband net-
works we’re talking about are the roads and the highways and the 
canals of the 21st century. And we all know what happened in the 
last century. If the railroad didn’t come to your city, bypassed your 
city,  your  city  didn’t  thrive,  and  sometimes  it  didn’t  even  survive. 
So  it’s  a  matter  of  really  getting  a  strategy,  bringing  America  into 
the game. And it’s not just the international context that I’m look-

I’m  looking  at  the  gap  within  our  country  between  rural  and 
urban  America.  We  had  in  the  last  century  a  gap  even  within  the 
basic  telecommunications  until  close  to  the  end  between  rural  and 
urban America. If we don’t get this broadband right, we’re going to 
have  a  bigger  gap  between  rural  and  urban  America  in  the  21st 
century  with  all  this  fantastic  new  technology  and  all  the  promise 
that it holds than we had in the days of plain old telephone service 
in the last century. I don’t think we can afford to wait for that. 

The  world’s  not  going  to  wait  for  Arkansas  or  rural  America  or 
the  United  States  to  catch  up.  We’ve  got  to  do  that  ourselves,  so 
I’m delighted to be here today to learn from your experience. I don’t 
know  that  there  is  any  ‘‘one  size  fits  all’’  solution  to  broadband— 
cities  are  different  than  the  country,  mountainous  areas  are  dif-
ferent  than  the  deltas,  and  there  are  a  lot  of  individual  problems 
that we need to grapple with. The key, to me, is getting a strategy 
and with everybody working together to make that happen. 

Just  some  ideas  that  I  will  just  very  quickly  throw  out,  then  I’ll 
be  quiet,  because  I  think  part  of  strategy  would  be  having  a  Uni-
versal  Service  Fund  that  really  has  broadband  as  its  core  mission. 
I  think  that  would  be  good.  I  think  it  would  really  help  get  this 
technology  out.  And  I  think  that  the  folks  on  the  business  end 
would understand what the national strategy is. Business can’t op-
erate  with  a  question  mark  as  Senator  Hollings  used  to  tell  me 
when  I  worked  for  him.  So  everybody  needs  to  know  what  the 
strategy is. And it means having a much more active Federal Com-
munications  Commission  than  we  have  right  now.  We’re  not  col-
lecting  the  data.  We’re  still  calling  broadband  200  kilobits  up  and 
down.  We’re  still  saying  if  there  is  one  subscriber  in  a  Zip  Code, 
ergo everybody must have broadband. That’s like saying if one per-
son drives a Cadillac in town then that must mean everybody’s got 
a Cadillac. That’s the same kind of silly logic. 

And  then  we  have  to  have  an  FCC  that’s  crafting  innovative  so-
lutions  with  the  authority  it  has.  And  then  beyond  the  FCC,  it 
means  government  coming  up  with  solutions  that  may  include  tax 
incentives, more loans for rural utilities service, encouraging a mu-
nicipality in local and regional innovations. Those are just some of

the  thoughts  I  would  have.  I  want  to  thank  everybody  for  being 
here  today,  and  sharing  your  experiences.  And  I  know  when  I  go 
back,  I  will  have  this  valuable  information  to  put  into  my  calcu-
lator  as  we  try  to  write  rules  that  make  sense  for  the  future.  So 
thank you, Senator, very much for inviting me here today. 

[The prepared statement of Commissioner Copps follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL J. COPPS, COMMISSIONER, 

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 

Good  morning  and  thank  you  Senator  Pryor  for  inviting  me  to  be  here  with  you 
and so many good Arkansans this morning. I’m happy to be here for many reasons. 
First, I worked in the U.S. Senate for many years and getting to spend some quality 
time  with  our  Senate  leaders  is  always  exciting  for  me—especially  when  it’s  some-
one  who  epitomizes  the  best  of  the  Senate—mastering  the  issues,  knowing  how  to 
work  across  the  aisle  to  get  things  done,  and  having  an  expansive  vision  for  this 
great country of ours. Like your father before you, you add luster to the Senate. I’m 
also  glad  to  be  here  because  of  the  proximity  of  the  Presidential  Library.  I  had  the 
honor  of  serving  President  Bill  Clinton  as  Assistant  Secretary  of  Commerce  for 
Trade  Development  and  I  am  so  proud  of  what  he  accomplished  for  America  both 
at  home  and  around  the  world  and  proud  of  the  opportunity  he  gave  me  to  serve. 
‘‘Don’t  stop  thinking  about  tomorrow,’’  Bill  Clinton  told  us.  And  that’s  what  this 
hearing is all about—tomorrow. Where are we heading in this still-new twenty-first 
century  and  what  role  are  telecommunications  going  to  play  in  shaping  our  future? 
My  answer  to  that  is  that  the  future  will  belong  to  those  who  learn  best  how  to 
deploy  all  these  new  technologies,  products  and  services.  My  answer  is  we  have  to 
get  this  right  for  America.  And  part  of  my  answer,  unfortunately,  is  that  right  now 
we’re not where we need to be. Oh, I know we all have lots of new gizmos and gadg-
ets  and  that  advanced  telecommunications  like  broadband  have  brought  us  some 
pretty fundamental changes, including right here in Arkansas. But I also know that 
other  countries  are  eating  our  lunch  in  building  their  communications  infrastruc-
tures  and  I  believe  that  America’s  lack  of  a  concerted  national  strategy  to  get  back 
in the lead is tantamount to playing Russian roulette with our future. 

Let  me  begin  by  saying  that  my  overriding  objective  since  going  to  the  FCC  in 
2001  has  been  to  bring  the  best,  most  accessible  and  cost-effective  communications 
system  in  the  world  to  all  of  our  people—and  I  mean  all  of  our  people.  We  can’t 
leave  anybody  behind  in  this  great  new  age  of  high-speed  communications.  That 
means  those  who  live  in  rural  America,  those  who  live  in  the  inner  city  and  those 
who live on tribal lands; it means not just the affluent and privileged, but those who 
are  economically  disadvantaged  and  those  with  disabilities.  Each  and  every  citizen 
of this great country should have access to the wonders of communications. I’m not 
talking  about  doing  all  these  people  some  kind  of  feel-good,  do-gooder  favor  by  in-
cluding  them;  I’m  talking  about  doing  America  a  favor.  I’m  talking  about  making 
certain our citizens can compete here at home and around the world with those who 
are already using broadband in all aspects of their lives. 

The  way  I  see  it,  broadband  is  really  the  great  infrastructure  challenge  of  our 
time.  If  you  course  back  through  the  annals  of  America’s  past,  you  will  find  that 
just about every major era confronted a stark infrastructure challenge. In the early 
days, as we settled new lands, the need was to get the produce and products of our 
settlers to market—so we built roads and turnpikes and ports and canals to get the 
job  done.  Then,  as  we  became  a  continental,  industrial  power,  we  needed  railroads 
to bring the Nation together, so we laid a railway grid across the country, climaxed 
by  the  great  saga  of  the  transcontinental  railroads.  Closer  to  our  own  era,  in  the 
Eisenhower years, came the Interstate Highway System, to bind city and state and 
nation.  Even  in  telecom,  we  found  ways  to  get  telephone  service  out  to  most  of  our 
citizens.  And  here’s  my  point:  in  all  of  these  great  infrastructure  build-outs,  there 
has always been a critical role for business, local community organizations and gov-
ernment  to  work  together  toward  a  great  national  objective.  We  didn’t  just  throw 
up our hands and say ‘‘Leave it to somebody else,’’ or ‘‘the market will automatically 
get  it  all  done.’’  No,  these  things  were  the  business  of  the  people.  That’s  how  we 
looked at these challenges. That’s how we overcame them. That, my friends, is pre-
cisely  how  we  built  this  great  country  of  ours.  We  pulled  together  and  worked  to-
gether.  You  know,  we  all  rightly  value  that  great  Declaration  of  Independence  and 
that  glorious  fight  for  freedom,  but  in  reality  it  was  millions  of  Americans  making 
a declaration of interdependence, one upon the other, that won us our freedom and 
allowed us to build the greatest nation in history.

To me—and I believe this deeply—the broadband networks are the roads and ca-
nals  and  railways  and  highways  of  the  Information  Age.  Our  future  will  be  decid-
edly  affected  by  how  we  master,  or  fail  to  master,  advanced  communications  net-
works  and  how  quickly  and  how  well  we  build  out  high-speed  communications 
connectivity. If we succeed, we will create millions upon millions of new educational 
and  economic  opportunities.  We  will  see  new  local  businesses—and  local  govern-
ments,  too—providing  tremendous  value-added  services  everywhere  in  the  country. 
We  will  advance  medical  care  through  the  development  and  delivery  of  new  health 
services.  We  will  ensure  that  schools  and  libraries  are  huge  digital  resources  for 
their communities. We will give that aspiring small business person in any number 
of  rural  Arkansas  communities  a  level  field  on  which  to  compete  with  folks  in  the 
city and competitors around the globe. 

Those who get access to high-speed broadband will win. Those who don’t will lose. 
It’s as simple as that. I want to help make sure we all get there, and that America’s 
rural  communities  get  there  as  soon  as  everyone  else.  I’ll  tell  you  this  with  con-
fidence: if high-speed broadband is permitted to be primarily an urban phenomenon, 
the digital gap in this country that already separates urban and rural America will 
grow  still  wider  and  rural  America  will  be  relatively  worse  off  in  the  twenty-first 
century  of  modern  communications  than  it  was  in  the  days  of  plain  old  telephone 
service in the last century. We can’t let that happen. This competitive world of ours 
is  not  going  to  make  time  for  rural  America  to  catch  up.  That  may  sound  harsh, 
but it’s also true. 

The  important  question,  of  course,  is  what  can  we  do  about  all  this?  Now  I  don’t 
happen  to  think  there  is  a  one-size-fits-all  broadband  solution  for  this  country.  The 
Ozarks  in  northern  Arkansas  will  likely  require  a  different  tact  than  the  flat  ex-
panses  of  the  Delta  along  the  eastern  border.  And  surely  whatever  plans  we  have 
for dense urban centers like Austin or Denver are not going to be the ticket for suc-
cess  in  our  rural  communities.  There  are  great  differences—in  population,  culture 
and  topography  across  this  vast  land  of  ours.  So  we  need  to  embrace  all  kinds  of 
solutions if we have any chance of succeeding. 

I  think  that  means  we  need  a  Universal  Service  Fund  that  has  broadband  as  its 
core  mission.  It  means  encouraging  communities  to  develop  innovative  solutions  to 
getting  broadband  out.  It  means  having  a  Federal  Communications  Commission 
that provides the hard data we all need to understand exactly where we are—basic 
things  like  who  actually  has  broadband,  what  it  is  costing,  and  how  fast  it  is.  It 
means  having  an  FCC  that  is  committed  to  deploying  its  expertise  and  assistance 
much more proactively than has been the case in recent years. It means government 
coming  up  with  solutions  that  might  include  tax  incentives,  more  Rural  Utilities 
Service loans, public-private partnerships, and encouraging some old fashioned com-
petition.  And  it  means  having  government  at  all  levels  implementing  a  creative, 
comprehensive and well-funded strategy. 

I look forward to getting your thoughts today. I want to understand better where 
you  are  and  where  you  think  we  should  be  heading.  So  thank  you  all  for  coming 
here  today—providers,  local  officials,  educators,  entrepreneurs,  technologists,  con-
sumers and citizens who understand the real challenges and promise in your home 
state.  I  have  no  doubt  that  what  I  hear  today  will  help  shape  my  views  as  I  work 
back in Washington to craft policies that can bring broadband to all Americans. And 
I  am  optimistic  that  everyone  here,  pulling  and  hauling  together,  can  make  sure 
that  in  the  broadband  revolution  of  our  time  no  community—and  no  Arkansan—is 
left behind.

STATEMENT OF HON. JONATHAN S. ADELSTEIN, 

COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 
Commissioner  ADELSTEIN.  Thank  you,  Senator  Pryor  and  Mr. 
Chairman  today  for  inviting  me  to  discuss  this  common  goal  that 
we  have  of  making  sure  we  deploy  broadband  everywhere  in  this 
country,  including  to  the  rural  parts  of  this  state  and  rural  Amer-
ica. I certainly want to thank you all for the warm southern hospi-
tality.  Reminded  me  of  back  when  I  visited  in  the  days  of  when 
your  father  was  a  senator.  What  a  wonderful  place  this  is.  What 
a  beautiful  state  it  is.  And  what  a  wonderful  bunch  of  people  that 
know  how  to  get  together  and  do  things.  We  certainly  have  a  fine

set  of  panelists,  and  we  thank  you  all  for  sharing  your  insights 
with us today. 

I  certainly  commend  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  your  leadership  on 
this  issue.  I  know  that  in  Washington,  you’re  seen  as  one  of  the 
leaders  on  technology  and  telecommunications  issues,  not  only  as 
a  function  of  being  on  the  Commerce  Committee,  but  as  a  Co- 
Chairman  of  the  Senate  Democratic  High-Tech  Task  Force.  You 
really recognize the importance of promoting these innovative tech-
nologies and promoting broadband deployment, and how important 
that  is  as  you’ve  explained  this  morning.  I  mean,  your  focus  as 
you’ve  said  on  broadband  is  so  important,  because  it  really  does 
change  and  revolutionize  the  way  that  our  economy  works,  the 
health care opportunities for our people, public safety, which relies 
on  broadband  technology,  educational  opportunities,  and  even  the 
very social and democratic opportunities for people to participate in 
our government. 

Broadband is creating whole new opportunities by connecting en-
trepreneurs to millions of customers as we’ve mentioned is the case 
in  northwest  Arkansas  facilitating  telecommuting,  allowing  com-
munities  to  attract  skilled  workers  and  increasing  productivity  for 
business  and  government  of  all  sizes.  I  think  coming  from  South 
Dakota  as  you  said  and  having  worked  for  this  state  for  six  years, 
I  certainly  think  that  broadband  is  critical  for  the  rural  economic 
development  of  this  state  and  really  for  all  of  rural  America.  We 
have  a  challenge  on  our  hands,  and  it’s  a  real  problem  if  we  don’t 
allow  the  full  potential  of  people  to  be  realized,  that  they’ll  fall 
even further behind. 

So here we have an opportunity for enormous progress, but there 
is  actually  peril  on  the  other  side,  because  as  other  countries  and 
other  parts  of  the  country  are  expanding  and  advancing  in  tech-
nology,  if  rural  America  falls  behind  and—or  continues  to  remain 
behind,  the  gap  could  get  even  larger.  And  that’s  tragic,  because 
the  upside  is  so  amazing.  Think  about  distance  learning  in  tele-
medicine  and  how  it’s  transforming  the  way  we  educate  and  care 
for our citizens, and robust broadband services are critical in times 
of disaster as we saw in the Katrina situation. It conveys enormous 
amounts  of  information  to  public  safety,  it  also  enables  citizens  to 
reach  each  other  in  a  time  of  need  and  it  helps  first  responders. 
All  these  applications  that  you  can  go  on  and  on  about,  and  we’re 
only scratching the surface. Now, in this age of global competitive-
ness  where  we’re  competing  with  Bangalore,  India,  I  think  we’ve 
got to tap the potential of all of our citizens, no matter where they 
live, to reach our full level of economic growth. We need to prevent 
outsourcing  of  jobs  overseas  by  promoting  the  insourcing  of  jobs 
right here in the U.S. by companies within our own borders. 

For  a  long  time,  particularly  under  the  leadership  of  one  of  Ar-
kansas’ own, whose library we enjoyed the hospitality of last night, 
the  U.S.  was  the  world  leader  in  telecommunications.  And  there 
was  a  real  focus—regular  meetings  at  the  White  House—real  na-
tional  leadership  on  this  issue.  And  we  need  more  of  that  kind  of 
leadership  in  the  Federal,  state,  and  local  levels.  I  have  been  en-
couraged that with the changes in Congress, the Senate Commerce 
Committee  has  heightened  its  attention  to  this  issue  over  the  past 
year as evidenced by this hearing today.

Now,  this  is  the  first  Congressional  hearing—I’ve  been  in  the 
FCC  for  five  years,  and  this  is  the  first  time  I’ve  been  invited  to 
a state to focus on the impact of broadband in that particular state. 
And that’s a real testament of the kind of leadership we have here, 
and  that  Senator  Pryor  brings  nationwide  and  certainly  Arkansas 
needs that, and so does every state. 

We need to learn more about the challenges in Arkansas, and I’m 
glad  we’re  going  to  hear  from  you  today,  so  we  can  forge  together 
a path forward to make progress here. This is the kind of attention 
and  importance  that  an  issue  like  this  deserves.  And  we’ve  made 
some  progress,  and  we’re  going  to  hear  some  positive  lessons  from 
each of you here this morning. I remain concerned though as a na-
tion  that  we  are  failing  to  keep  pace  with  our  global  competitors. 
My  colleagues  here  talked  about  how  we’re  slipping  down  in  the 
international  rankings  of  broadband  penetration.  But  the  real  im-
portant statistic to me is that citizens of other countries are getting 
a  better  broadband  deal—more  megabits  for  less  money  than 
Americans. 

And  that’s  not  just  a  PR  problem  which  some  of  my  colleagues 
fight  back  at  The  Wall  Street  Journal  and  other  places,  say,  ‘‘oh, 
don’t—don’t  look  at  the  statistics.’’  That’s  a  real  productivity  prob-
lem  for  our  economy.  We’ve  got  to  do  better.  I  am  concerned  also 
that  the  lack  of  a  coherent  broadband  plan  is  one  of  the  reasons 
that  we’re  falling  behind.  Every  other  country  that  has  a  national 
plan is the—are the ones that are beating us. And we need a com-
prehensive  national  broadband  strategy  that  targets  the  needs  of 
every  part  of  this  country.  It  should  incorporate  benchmarks,  de-
ployment  timetables,  and  measurable  thresholds  that  gauge 
progress.  We  need  to  set  ambitious  goals,  shooting  for  affordable 
high-speed  broadband.  We  should  start  by  getting  better  data,  so 
we can ascertain where the problems are and develop solutions. 

The FCC should be able to give Congress and consumers a clear 
sense of the price per megabit, just as we look at the price per gal-
lon as an indicator of economic welfare. 

Now,  an  important  tool  for  mapping  broadband  availability, 
which would enable the public and private sectors to work together 
to target under-served areas is something that you’re talking about 
doing  here  in  Arkansas,  this  Connect  Arkansas,  which  the  legisla-
ture  recently  approved  and  the  governor  signed.  That  kind  of  ini-
tiative  is  something  I  look  forward  to  hearing  more  about.  It 
worked  well  in  Kentucky,  and  I  certainly  think  it  can  work  well 
here in Arkansas. And as we look at a national broadband strategy, 
I think we’ve got to increase incentives for investment, because the 
private  sector  is  going  to  be  the  primary  driver  of  growth.  We’ve 
got  to  promote  competition,  because  ultimately  that’s  the  most  ef-
fective  driver  of  both  innovation  and  lower  prices  for  consumers. 
Now Federal universal service plays a vital role in maintaining and 
improving  rural  networks,  it’s  a  big  source  of—of  funding  here  in 
Arkansas  as  voice  becomes  just  one  application  along  with  data 
and  video  over  broadband  pipes,  I  think  we  need  to  ensure  that 
universal  service  evolves  as  Congress  intended  to  promote  ubiq-
uitous  broadband.  We  should  make  broadband  the  dial  tone  of  the 
21st century.

One  of  the  best  opportunities  for  promoting  broadband  also  is 
through  spectrum-based  or  wireless  opportunities.  We’ve  got  to  as-
sess  the  latest  technological  developments  and  get  spectrum  into 
the  hands  of  operators  that  are  ready  and  willing  to  serve  at  the 
most  local  levels.  We  have  this  upcoming  700  megahertz  auction, 
which  is  of  the  old  television  bands.  We  have  an  historic  oppor-
tunity  there  to  facilitate  the  emergence  of  a  third  broadband  plat-
form. That’s the kind of competition we need. So this is the biggest 
and  most  important  auction  that  we’re  going  to  have  for  many 
years to come. And while the rules for the upcoming auction reflect 
a compromise, not everything I wanted, but I hope there will be op-
portunity  there  for  a  diverse  group  of  licensees  and  we  can  put  in 
the  most  aggressive  build-out  requirements  in  the  history  of  the 
FCC.  That  should  benefit  consumers  everywhere  in  the  state,  in-
cluding the rural areas. Unlicensed broadband services are also an 
important avenue for a lot of underserved communities. Unlicensed 
spectrum  is  free  and  lightly  used  in  rural  areas,  and  it  can  be 
accessed  immediately,  so  the  equipment  is  relatively  cheap,  be-
cause there is a good national market for it. 

So we’re working at the FCC to make more unlicensed spectrum 
available  at  higher  power  levels.  There’s  a  lot  more  Congress  can 
do,  too,  as  part  of  the  national  broadband  strategy  outside  of  the 
scope  of  the  FCC,  such  as  adequate  funding  for  the  rural  utility 
service,  broadband  loans  and  grants,  and  making  sure  that  those 
loans  and  grants  are  properly  targeted  to  areas  that  really  need  it 
and not just subsidizing competition. 

There  can  be  tax  incentives  for  companies  that  invest  in 
broadband to underserved areas. We can devise better depreciation 
rules  for  capital  investments  and  targeted  telecommunications 
services.  We  need  to  invest  in  basic  science  research  and  develop-
ment to spur further innovation in telecommunications. We need to 
improve  math  and  science  education.  And  also  we  need  to  make 
sure we get computers in the hands of all of our citizens who want 
one  but  can’t  afford  one.  So  if  you  don’t  have  a  computer, 
broadband doesn’t mean anything to you. 

One  other  idea  I  think  is  ripe  for  consideration  now  is  perhaps 
it’s time for a national summit on rural broadband initiated at the 
Federal  level  involving  state,  local,  and  tribal  governments  along 
with  the  private  sector  who’s  going  to  drive  this  to  forge  a  con-
sensus and show the kind of leadership we need around developing 
a national strategy. I certainly look forward to hearing from all the 
impressive panelists here today. I thank you for inviting me to tes-
tify and for holding this hearing. 

[The prepared statement of Commissioner Adelstein follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JONATHAN S. ADELSTEIN, COMMISSIONER, 

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 

Thank you, Senator Pryor, for inviting me to testify about one of the critical chal-
lenges confronting our Commission and the country: ensuring the deployment of af-
fordable,  high-speed  broadband  infrastructure  to  every  corner  of  this  country.  I 
would  also  like  to  thank  Governor  Mike  Beebe,  the  Arkansas  Chamber  of  Com-
merce,  the  many  fine  panelists  who  will  share  their  insight,  and  the  citizens  of  Ar-
kansas for welcoming us to your state today. 

Senator Pryor, I want to commend you and the Committee for the vital leadership

Co-Chairman  of  the  Senate  Democratic  High-Tech  Task  Force,  you  have  recognized 
the  importance  of  promoting  technological  innovation  and  advanced  telecommuni-
cations for providing good jobs and enhancing our standard of living. 

I  appreciate  your  focus  on  these  concerns,  which  are  so  critical  to  the  economic 
and social prosperity of our communities. You understand the need to maximize the 
potential  of  every  citizen  to  contribute  to  our  social,  cultural  and  economic  life 
through communications. We must tap the talents of everyone in America, whether 
they  live  in  cities  or  in  rural  areas,  whether  they  are  Native  Americans  living  on 
tribal  lands  or  residents  of  economically  challenged  sections  of  our  inner  cities, 
whether  they  live  with  disabilities,  whether  or  not  they  speak  English,  and  regard-
less of their income level. I would like to talk to you today about why I believe this 
is  such  an  important  guiding  principle  for  communications  policy  and  some  of  the 
ways  we  at  the  FCC,  you  in  Congress,  and  all  of  the  participants  here  today  can 
achieve this ambitious goal. 

We must engage in a concerted and coordinated effort to restore our place as the 
world  leader  in  telecommunications  by  making  available  to  all  our  citizens  afford-
able,  true  broadband,  capable  of  carrying  voice,  data  and  video  signals.  An  issue  of 
this  importance  to  our  future  warrants  a  comprehensive  national  broadband  strat-
egy that targets the needs of all Americans. 
The Role of Broadband for our Nation’s Communities 

We are only scratching the surface of the opportunities that broadband can bring. 
We  stand  at  the  threshold  of  a  revolution  in  the  applications  that  will  ride  over 
broadband  infrastructure.  By  expanding  the  reach  of  advanced  communications 
technologies, we can bring new hope to many communities where it is in short sup-
ply. 

For  a  long  time,  the  U.S.  was  the  undisputed  world  leader  in  communications 
technology. Yet, in recent years, we have tumbled out of our historic global position. 
I  am  particularly  concerned  that  we  give  our  communities  the  tools  that  they  need 
to  compete  in  a  more  global  era.  We  need  greater  leadership  on  this  issue  at  the 
Federal,  state,  and  local  levels.  I  am  encouraged  that  the  Senate  Commerce  Com-
mittee has heightened its attention to this issue over the past year. 

Hearings like this play a key role. Since I joined the Commission, I have traveled 
across the country and seen the impact of broadband on the economic, health, public 
safety, education, social and democratic opportunities of our citizens. Yet, this is the 
first  time  I  have  ever  been  invited  to  a  Congressional  field  hearing  that  focuses  on 
the impact of broadband on a particular state. That is testament to the kind of lead-
ership  that  can  propel  Arkansas  forward  to  the  front  ranks  of  broadband  deploy-
ment.  Every  state,  and  the  Nation  as  a  whole,  needs  this  kind  of  initiative  by  its 
leaders. 

I am pleased to share some of my thoughts, and am also looking forward to hear-
ing  the  testimony  of  the  many  Arkansas  state  and  local  government  officials,  your 
regional  leadership,  representatives  of  the  educational  and  telemedicine  commu-
nities,  providers,  and  others  who  will  testify  today.  Together,  we  can  learn  more 
about  the  opportunities  and  challenges  faced  here  in  Arkansas  and  forge  the  path 
toward progress. 

Right now, broadband is creating economic opportunities that were previously un-
attainable, and the potential is even greater. Broadband can connect entrepreneurs 
to  millions  of  new  distant  potential  customers,  facilitate  telecommuting,  and  in-
crease  productivity.  Much  of  the  economic  growth  we  have  experienced  in  the  last 
decade  is  attributable  to  productivity  increases  that  have  arisen  from  advances  in 
technology,  particularly  in  telecommunications.  These  new  connections  increase  the 
efficiency  of  existing  business  and  create  new  jobs  by  allowing  news  businesses  to 
emerge  and  new  developments  such  as  remote  business  locations  and  call  centers. 
The opportunities for rural areas that have seized the initiative are enormous. 

Broadband  technologies  are  being  harnessed  in  ways  that  folks  back  inside  the 
Beltway might never have imagined. For example, at auction houses across the Mid-
west,  entrepreneurs  are  using  broadband  technologies  to  conduct  real  time  cattle 
auctions over the Internet. Ranchers from across the country can log in, watch real 
time  video  of  the  livestock  and  make  purchases  without  leaving  their  ranches.  By 
putting their livestock up for bid in cyberspace, these auction houses have been able 
to  bridge  remote  locations,  expand  their  potential  markets,  and  cut  the  costs  of 
reaching their customers. 

Broadband can also unlock transformational opportunities through distance learn-
ing and specialty classes that might otherwise be confined within the physical walls 
of  a  traditional  school.  Similarly,  telemedicine  applications  are  giving  rural  Ameri-
cans  access  to  diagnostic  services,  like  mobile  mammography  and  emergency  serv-
ices that had been unavailable because of distance, cost, weather, or geography.

As  we  saw  in  events  like  the  devastation  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  communications 
services  become  even  more  critical  in  times  of  disaster  or  national  emergency, 
whether as a means of conveying critical information to the public, enabling citizens 
to communicate with their loved ones, or providing an essential tool for our first re-
sponders.  Broadband  networks  are  essential  to  any  plan  to  make  emergency  net-
works robust and redundant enough to survive and function in the face of such dis-
asters in the future. 

Broadband  technologies  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  in  even 
some  of  our  most  remote  and  economically  challenged  communities.  I  have  seen 
communities  leveraging  broadband  infrastructure  to  bring  jobs:  opportunities  that 
serve not only as important sources of employment, but also as training grounds for 
the young people of the community. In almost every small community I visit, I hear 
how  hard  it  is  to  develop  a  workforce  with  sufficient  training  in  technology.  Yet 
without  such  workers,  it  is  hard  for  a  small  town  to  develop  and  oversee  cutting 
edge communications systems. 

We  want  people  to  be  able  to  stay,  work,  and  thrive  in  the  communities  where 
they  grew  up.  The  problem  I  often  hear  that  it  is  harder  to  keep  young  people  in 
rural  areas  these  days  because  they  sense  a  palpable  lack  of  local  opportunities. 
Broadband  communications  can  benefit  our  communities  in  many  ways,  perhaps 
most of all by restoring the sense of opportunity that first made Americans venture 
forth  and  settle  the  more  remote  areas  of  this  country.  Broadband  can  help  our 
young  people  who  want  to  live  where  they  grew  up,  and  enjoy  that  quality  of  life, 
have new opportunities for work and advancement. 

Efforts to draw attention to the importance of high-speed Internet access are crit-
ical.  I  understand  that  Arkansas  recently  adopted  a  unique  public-private  partner-
ship—Connect  Arkansas—to  enhance  broadband  availability  and  subscribership. 
Such  public-private  partnerships  can  play  an  important  role,  educating  businesses 
and consumers about the importance of broadband and aggregating demand so that 
there  will  be  incentives  for  providers  to  build.  It  worked  well  in  Kentucky,  and  it 
can work well in Arkansas. 
Broadband and Global Competitiveness 

Keeping  our  communities  connected  and  ensuring  that  the  latest  technologies 
reach  all  Americans,  including  those  in  remote  and  underserved  areas,  are  prin-
ciples  that  are  enshrined  in  the  Communications  Act.  Meeting  these  goals  will  be 
more important than ever as we enter a new age of global competitiveness. 

Even as consumers are increasingly empowered to use broadband in newer, more 
creative ways, the stage on which we all must compete is also evolving into a global 
one.  New  telecommunications  networks  are  a  key  driver  of  this  new  global  land-
scape.  They  let  people  do  jobs  from  anywhere  in  the  world—whether  an  office  in 
downtown  Manhattan,  a  home  on  the  Mississippi  Delta,  or  a  call  center  in  Ban-
galore,  India.  This  trend  should  be  a  wake-up  call  for  Americans  to  demand  the 
highest  quality  communications  systems  across  our  nation,  so  that  we  can  harness 
the  full  potential,  productivity  and  efficiency  of  our  own  country.  We  must  give  all 
our towns the tools they need to compete in this new marketplace. If we fail in this, 
be assured, our competitors around the world will take full advantage of us. 

We’ve  made  progress,  many  providers  are  deeply  committed,  and  there  are  posi-
tive lessons to draw on. Yet, I am increasingly concerned that we have failed to keep 
pace with our global competitors over the past few years. Each year, we slip further 
down the regular rankings of broadband penetration. While some have protested the 
international broadband penetration rankings, the fact is the U.S. has dropped year- 
after-year.  This  downward  trend  and  the  lack  of  broadband  value  illustrate  the  so-
bering  point  that  when  it  comes  to  giving  our  citizens  affordable  access  to  state-of 
the-art communications, the U.S. has fallen behind its global competitors. 

There  is  no  doubt  about  the  evidence  that  citizens  of  other  countries  are  getting 
a  much  greater  broadband  value  in  the  form  of  more  megabits  for  less  money.  A 
recent  OECD  report  ranked  U.S.  12th  in  broadband  value.  According  to  the  ITU, 
the digital opportunity afforded to U.S. citizens is 21st in the world. For small busi-
nesses,  those  in  rural  areas,  and  low  income  consumers,  the  problems  can  be  even 
more acute. This is more than a public relations problem. It is a major productivity 
problem, and our citizens deserve better. Indeed, if we do not do better for everyone 
in  America,  then  we  will  all  suffer  economic  injury.  In  this  broadband  world,  more 
than ever, we are truly all in this together and we need to tap all of our resources. 
Some  have  argued  that  the  reason  we  have  fallen  so  far  in  the  international 
broadband rankings is that we are a more rural country than many of those ahead 
of us. If that is the case, and since geography is destiny and we cannot change ours, 
we should redouble our efforts and get down to the business of addressing and over-
coming this challenge.

I  am  concerned  that  the  lack  of  a  comprehensive  broadband  communications  de-
ployment plan is one of the reasons that the U.S. is increasingly falling further be-
hind  our  global  competitors.  Virtually  every  other  developed  country  has  imple-
mented a national broadband strategy. This must become a greater national priority 
for America than it is now. We need a strategy to prevent outsourcing of jobs over-
seas  by  promoting  the  ability  of  U.S.  companies  to  ‘‘in-source’’  within  our  own  bor-
ders. Rural America and underserved urban areas have surplus labor forces waiting 
to  be  tapped.  No  one  will  work  harder,  or  work  more  efficiently,  than  Americans 
but  many  are  currently  without  opportunities  simply  because  the  current  commu-
nications  infrastructure  is  inadequate  to  connect  them  with  a  good  job.  That  situa-
tion must improve. 
A National Broadband Strategy for All Americans 

A  true  broadband  strategy  should  incorporate  benchmarks,  deployment  time-
tables,  and  measurable  thresholds  to  gauge  our  progress.  We  need  to  set  ambitious 
goals and shoot for affordable, truly high-bandwidth broadband. We should start by 
updating  our  current  anemic  definition  of  high-speed  of  just  200  kbps  in  one  direc-
tion to something more akin to what consumers receive in countries with which we 
compete, speeds that are magnitudes higher than our current definitions. 

We must take a hard look at our successes and failures. We need much more reli-
able, specific data than the FCC currently compiles so that we can better ascertain 
our  current  problems  and  develop  responsive  solutions.  The  FCC  should  be  able  to 
give  Congress  and  consumers  a  clear  sense  of  the  price  per  megabit,  just  as  we  all 
look to the price per gallon of gasoline as a key indicator of consumer welfare. Giv-
ing  consumers  reliable  information  by  requiring  public  reporting  of  actual 
broadband speeds by providers would spur better service and enable the free market 
to function more effectively. Another important tool is better mapping of broadband 
availability,  which  would  enable  the  public  and  private  sectors  to  work  together  to 
target  underserved  areas.  Legislation  under  consideration  by  leaders  in  both  the 
House  and  the  Senate  would  enable  us  and  other  agencies  like  the  Census  Bureau 
to make enormous progress on this front. The Connect Arkansas initiative will help 
in this state, and a similar approach should be adopted nationwide. 

We  must  redouble  our  efforts  to  encourage  broadband  development  by  increasing 
incentives for investment, because we will rely on the private sector as the primary 
driver  of  growth.  These  efforts  must  take  place  across  technologies,  so  that  we  not 
only build on the traditional telephone and cable platforms, but also create opportu-
nities  for  deployment  of  fiber-to-the-home,  fixed  and  mobile  wireless,  broadband- 
over-power  line,  and  satellite  technologies.  We  must  work  to  promote  meaningful 
competition,  as  competition  is  the  most  effective  driver  of  innovation,  as  well  as 
lower prices. Only rational competition policies can ensure that the U.S. broadband 
market  does  not  devolve  into  a  stagnant  duopoly,  which  is  a  serious  concern  given 
that  cable  and  DSL  providers  now  control  approximately  96  percent  of  the  residen-
tial  broadband  market.  We  must  also  work  to  preserve  the  open  and  neutral  char-
acter that has been the hallmark of the Internet, in order to maximize its potential 
as a tool for economic opportunity, innovation, and so many forms of public partici-
pation. 

There  also  is  more  Congress  can  do,  outside  of  the  purview  of  the  FCC,  such  as 
providing  adequate  funding  for  Rural  Utilities  Service  broadband  loans  and  grants, 
and  establishing  new  grant  programs  supporting  public-private  partnerships  that 
can  identify  strategies  to  spur  deployment;  ensuring  RUS  properly  targets  those 
funds;  providing  tax  incentives  for  companies  that  invest  in  broadband  to  under-
served  areas;  devising  better  depreciation  rules  for  capital  investments  in  targeted 
telecommunications services; investing in basic science research and development to 
spur further innovation in telecommunications technology; and improving math and 
science  education  so  that  we  have  the  human  resources  to  fuel  continued  growth, 
innovation and usage of advanced telecommunications services. 

What  is  sorely  needed,  but  fortunately  in  evidence  here  today,  is  real  leadership 
at  all  levels  of  government,  working  in  partnership  with  the  private  sector,  to  re-
store  our  leadership  in  telecommunications.  This  type  of  attention  is  needed  today 
on  a  national  scale.  Much  as  we  focus  on  Arkansas,  today,  a  National  Summit  on 
Broadband—or a series of such summits—mediated by the Federal Government and 
involving  the  private  sector,  could  focus  the  kind  of  attention  that  is  needed  to  re-
store our place as the world leader in telecommunications. 

Two  other  critical  steps  toward  a  national  strategy,  elaborated  upon  below,  are 
properly  channeling  universal  service  toward  broadband  and  promoting  spectrum- 
based services for Rural America.

Universal Service: Evolving for the Broadband Age 

Congress  and  the  Commission  recognized  early  on  that  the  economic,  social,  and 
public health benefits of the telecommunications network increase for all subscribers 
with the addition of each new subscriber. Federal universal service continues to play 
a  vital  role  in  meeting  our  commitment  to  connectivity,  helping  to  maintain  high 
levels  of  telephone  penetration  and  increasing  access  for  our  Nation’s  schools  and 
libraries.  With  almost  a  decade  behind  us  since  the  1996  Act,  the  FCC  is  re-exam-
ining  almost  every  aspect  of  our  Federal  universal  service  policies,  from  the  way 
that we conduct contributions and distributions, to our administration and oversight 
of  the  fund.  As  this  review  has  gone  forward,  I  have  worked  hard  to  preserve  and 
advance the universal service programs as Congress intended. 

We need to make broadband the dial-tone of the 21st century. Ensuring the vital-
ity  of  universal  service  will  be  particularly  important  as  technology  continues  to 
evolve.  Increasingly,  voice,  video,  and  data  will  flow  to  homes  and  businesses  over 
broadband  platforms.  In  this  new  world,  as  voice  becomes  just  one  application  over 
broadband  networks,  we’ve  got  to  have  ubiquitous  broadband  pipes  to  carry  the 
most  valuable  Internet  Protocol  (IP)  services  everywhere.  Without  such  broadband 
networks,  IP  services  can’t  reach  their  full  audience  or  capability.  The  economic, 
public health, and social externalities associated with access to broadband networks 
will be far more important than the significant effects associated with the plain-old- 
telephone-service network, because broadband services will touch so many different 
aspects of our lives. So, it is important that the Commission conduct its stewardship 
of universal service with the highest of standards and that we ensure that universal 
service  evolves  to  promote  advanced  services,  which  is  a  priority  that  Congress  has 
made explicitly clear. 
Wireless: A Critical Source of Broadband Services 

One  of  the  best  opportunities  for  promoting  broadband,  particularly  in  rural 
areas,  and  providing  competition  across  the  country,  is  in  maximizing  the  potential 
of spectrum-based services. The Commission must do more to stay on top of the lat-
est developments in spectrum technology and policy, working with both licensed and 
unlicensed spectrum. Spectrum is the lifeblood for much of this new communications 
landscape.  The  past  several  years  have  seen  an  explosion  of  new  opportunities  for 
consumers, like Wi-Fi, satellite-based technologies, and more advanced mobile serv-
ices. We now have to be more creative with what I have described as ‘‘spectrum fa-
cilitation.’’  That  means  looking  at  all  types  of  approaches—technical,  economic  or 
regulatory—to  get  spectrum  into  the  hands  of  operators  ready  to  serve  consumers 
at the most local levels possible. 

Of  course,  licensed  spectrum  has  and  will  continue  to  be  the  backbone  for  much 
of our wireless communications network. We are already seeing broadband provided 
over  satellite,  new  wireless  broadband  systems  in  the  2.5  GHz  band,  and  the  in-
creasing  deployment  of  higher  speed  mobile  wireless  connections  from  existing  cel-
lular and PCS providers. 

During our review of the bandplan in advance of the auction last year of 90 MHz 
of  new  spectrum  for  the  Advanced  Wireless  Service,  I  pressed  for  the  inclusion  of 
smaller  blocks  of  licenses.  I  thought  that  smaller  license  blocks  would  improve  ac-
cess to spectrum by those providers who want to offer service to smaller areas, while 
also  providing  a  better  opportunity  for  larger  carriers  to  more  strategically  expand 
their  spectrum  footprints.  Our  decision  to  adopt  smaller  license  blocks  was  well  re-
ceived by a number of carriers and manufacturers. 

The Commission now has a historic opportunity in the upcoming 700 MHz auction 
to  facilitate  the  emergence  of  a  ‘‘third’’  broadband  platform  that  will  ensure  con-
sumers everywhere the benefits of a high-quality wireless broadband network. This 
is the biggest and most important auction we will see for many years to come. While 
the  Commission  recently  adopted  auction  rules  that  reflect  a  compromise  among 
many  different  competing  interests,  I  am  hopeful  that  there  will  be  opportunities 
for  a  diverse  group  of  licensees  in  the  700  MHz  auction  and  that  our  more  aggres-
sive  build-out  requirements  will  benefit  consumers  across  the  country.  We  also  put 
in place a new approach to spectrum management by adopting a meaningful, though 
not  perfect,  open  access  environment  on  a  significant  portion  of  the  700  MHz  spec-
trum.  This  decision  represents  an  honest,  good  faith  effort  to  establish  an  open  ac-
cess regime for devices and applications that will hopefully serve consumers well for 
many years to come. 

Unlicensed  broadband  services  are  an  intriguing  avenue  for  many  underserved 
communities  because  unlicensed  spectrum  is  free  and,  in  most  rural  areas,  lightly 
used. It can be accessed immediately, and the equipment is relatively cheap because 
it is so widely available. I have also worked closely with the Wireless Internet Serv-

ice  Provider  (WISP)  community,  which  has  been  particularly  focused  on  providing 
wireless broadband connectivity in rural and underserved areas. 

15 

But  we  can  always  do  more  for  rural  WISPs  and  other  unlicensed  users.  I  have 
heard  from  operators  who  want  access  to  additional  spectrum  and  at  higher  power 
levels. And the Commission has been doing just that. We have opened up 255 mega-
hertz  of  spectrum  in  the  5  GHz  band—more  spectrum  for  the  latest  Wi-Fi  tech-
nologies—and  are  looking  at  ways  to  increase  unlicensed  power  levels  in  rural 
areas. 

I  also  have  pushed  for  flexible  licensing  approaches  that  make  it  easier  for  com-
munity-based providers to get access to wireless broadband opportunities. We adopt-
ed  rules  to  make  spectrum  in  the  3650  MHz  band  available  for  wireless  broadband 
services.  To  promote  interest  in  the  band,  we  adopted  an  innovative,  hybrid  ap-
proach for spectrum access. It makes the spectrum available on a licensed, but non- 
exclusive, basis. I have spoken with representatives of the Community Wireless Net-
work  movement,  and  they  are  thrilled  with  this  decision  and  the  positive  impact  it 
will have on their efforts to deploy broadband networks in underserved communities 
around the country. 

We  have  also  made  spectrum  available  in  the  70/80/90  GHz  band  for  enterprise 
use. While you may not be familiar with this spectrum block, it can be used to con-
nect buildings with gigabit-speed wireless point-to-point links for a mile or more. In-
stead of digging up streets to bring fiber to buildings, licensees can set up a wireless 
link  for  a  fraction  of  the  cost—and  the  spectrum  is  available  to  anyone  holding  a 
license.  While  others  supported  an  auction,  I  successfully  argued  against  them  in 
this unique case, because I was concerned that auctions would raise the price of ac-
cess and shut out smaller licensees. In fact, one company now is installing five links 
for the City of Sioux Falls in my home state of South Dakota. The links will be used 
for  a  number  of  city  services,  including  public  works,  police  and  fire  departments, 
as an alternative to fiber. 
Conclusion 

Congress  has  charged  the  Commission  with  ensuring  that  the  American  public 
stays  well-connected,  directing  us  in  the  very  first  section  of  the  Communications 
Act  with  making  available  to  ‘‘all  the  people  of  the  United  States’’  rapid,  efficient 
nationwide  communications  services.  That  starts  with  a  continuing  commitment  to 
connectivity,  for  all  our  citizens.  For  the  sake  of  ourselves,  our  children,  and  this 
great  country,  we  must  be  bold  and  successful  in  this  endeavor.  So,  thank  you  for 
your  leadership  on  this  important  issue,  for  inviting  me  to  Arkansas  to  hear  from 
this  impressive  line-up  of  witnesses,  and  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  you 
today. 

Senator PRYOR. Well, thank you. Thank you both for being here. 
I  appreciate  your  words  of  wisdom  there.  Let  me  tell  you  what 
we’re  going  to  do  now.  I’m  not  even  going  to  introduce  everybody. 
I’m  going  to  let  everybody  just  introduce  themselves  very  quickly, 
and then—Daryl, from you all the way over here, we’re going to do 
three minutes per statement, then some students are going to have 
a ten, fifteen minute presentation. 

And then on this side of the room, we’re going to do two minutes. 
And  if  we  do  the  math  on  that,  we’re  running  well  over  an  hour 
there.  So  if  everybody  could  keep  their  comments  brief  and  stay 
within  their  allotted  times,  it  would  be  very  helpful.  And  we  may 
ask  questions  if  something  comes  up,  something  you  say  triggers 
a  question,  and  I  want  the  two  commissioners  to  feel  free  to  ask 
a question of some of the witnesses. That would be great. But we’re 
going to save most of our discussion for later. Once everybody’s had 
a  chance  to  do  their  opening  statement,  then  that’s  when  the  real 
discussion  will  start.  And  because  there  are  so  many—and  again, 
this  issue  touches  everybody  in  many  different  ways.  This  is  going 
to be much more of a round table-type discussion rather than a tra-
ditional Senate hearing.

We’ll  get  them  over  there,  and  we  start  pounding  on  them.  That’s 
not  going  to  be  the  nature  of  this.  This  is  going  to  be  much  more 
of  a  discussion.  I  love  your  thoughtful  comments,  your  impres-
sions—just things that you’re seeing out there around the state and 
things  we  need  to  do,  challenges,  good  ideas,  and  whatever  it  may 
be.  And  we’ll  have  that  discussion  after  everyone  does  their  open-
ing  statements.  But  please  bear  in  mind  the  two  Commissioners 
and  myself—we  may  ask  questions  of  the  witnesses  as  we  go.  So 
Daryl,  if  you  wouldn’t  mind  just  to  state  your  name  and  what  you 
do and give your three minutes, and we’ll go around the room. 
STATEMENT OF DARYL E. BASSETT, COMMISSIONER, 

ARKANSAS PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION 

Mr. BASSETT. I’m Daryl Bassett. I’m the Commissioner, Arkansas 
Public Service Commission. Senator Pryor, I want to thank you for 
this  historic  opportunity  to  discuss  broadband.  Commissioners 
Copps and Adelstein, welcome to Arkansas. 

First  question,  with  regard  to  broadband—it  readily  presents 
itself since there is near universal agreement about the benefits of 
broadband  deployment—is  why  aren’t  we  there  yet?  Why  are  we 
short  of  full  deployment?  And  I  think  the  question  there  lies—it’s 
a question of policy. I think as policymakers, we have to move clos-
er  or  look  closer  at  the  metrics  that  the  Federal  Government  cur-
rently uses in determining broadband usage in the country. 

Commissioner  Copps  touched  on  the  fact  that  we  need  to  pay 
more  attention  to  the  fact  of  the  broadband  bar,  200  kilobits  per 
second  is  laughable  when  you  consider  the  speeds  that  are  avail-
able  today.  I  think  that  any  oversight  committee  should  con-
template a review of that policy as well as the policy—the zip code 
policy.  That  says  that  if  anyone  within  a  zip  code  is  served  by 
broadband,  then  everyone  is  served  by  broadband.  I  think  at  the 
very least, we need to start looking at perhaps a zip code+four idea. 
That  approach  would  certainly  lend  quality  and  credibility  to  our 
data collection activities. I think the Broadband Data Improvement 
Act  that  recently  unanimously  passed  the  Senate  Commerce  Com-
mittee  goes  a  long  way,  rather,  to  closing  that  loophole.  I  support 
that  initiative  primarily,  because  I  think  the  FCC  should  be  di-
rected  to  come  up  with  a  new  metric  for  the  second-generation 
broadband.  And  I  think  that  second-generation  broadband  defini-
tion  should  be  the  minimum  speed  needed  to  string  full-motion, 
high-definition video. 

The  second  question  regards  our  regulatory  philosophy.  I  think 
we have to understand that the service providers are spending bil-
lions  of  dollars  right  now  trying  to  expand  the  Internet’s  carrying 
capacity  and  its  speed.  And  I  think  we  need  to  be  very  careful  as 
regulators  to  not  practice  any  anticipatory  regulation  that  might 
prevent  those  incentives  from  coming  to  bear.  Getting  dispersed 
areas  such  as  what  we  have  in  Arkansas  served  by  broadband  is 
tough,  it’s  risky.  Often  these  companies  have  no  idea  of  what  a 
take  rate  they’re  going  to  have  once  they  get  out  there.  We  need 
to look at incentivizing that kind of broadband deployment. And as 
a regulator, I’m particularly sensitive to any regulation that would 
prevent  that  kind  of  investment,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  I’m 
going  to  run  out  of  time  very  quickly,  but  I  just  really  want  to

stress  the  importance  of  continuing  the  process  of  increasing  the 
radio spectrum that Commissioner Adelstein spoke on. I also would 
encourage  you  to  continue  your  investigation  into  possibly  sub-
sidizing deployment in the areas that are considered marginal. 

Senator PRYOR. Good. Thank you. 

STATEMENT OF REX NELSON, ALTERNATE FEDERAL 

CO-CHAIRMAN, DELTA REGIONAL AUTHORITY 

Mr.  NELSON.  Thank  you  Senator  Pryor,  Commissioner  Copps, 
Commissioner  Adelstein.  We  appreciate  this  opportunity.  I’m  Rex 
Nelson. I’m one of President Bush’s two appointees to the Delta Re-
gional  Authority,  which  serves  240  counties  and  parishes  in  parts 
of  Arkansas,  Alabama,  Illinois,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Mississippi, 
Missouri,  and  Tennessee.  And  as  you  hit  on,  sometimes  when 
you’re  a  presidential  appointee  and  you  get  called  before  a  Senate 
committee by a member of the Majority, it’s not always a pleasant 
thing. 

So I appreciate this pleasant opportunity today, Senator. In fact, 
I’m  convinced  not  once  will  I  have  to  say,  ‘‘I  have  no  recollection 
of that, Senator,’’ today. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  NELSON.  Senator  Pryor  and  I  have  basically  known  each 
other since childhood, so he realizes he could put me under at any 
time,  Mr.  Commissioner,  anyway.  But  as  we  look  at  the  rural 
South,  the  area  of  the  country  that  we  cover,  after  World  War  II, 
we  saw  tremendous  gains  in  this  region  in  closing  that  huge  gap 
in average per capita income between the rural South and the rest 
of  the  country.  And  I  can  point  to  three,  among  other  reasons,  for 
that. That is we started paving our roads. We got electricity in the 
rural  areas.  And  because  we  got  electricity  in  the  rural  areas,  we 
got  air  conditioning  in  the  rural  areas.  So  suddenly  in  those  years 
after World War II, we got out of the mud, we got out of the dark, 
and  we  got  out  of  the  heat.  Can  you  imagine  having  this  hearing 
today with no air conditioning in this room? And we did it in large 
parts  of  the  rural  South  because  of  something  that  were  a  magic 
three  letters  around  the  region  called  the  REA,  the  Rural  Elec-
trification Administration. 

Now, if you look at the past ten to fifteen years, you will see that 
we have stopped making progress in the rural South in closing that 
gap.  We  have  not  successfully  in  our  region  made  the  trans-
formation  into  the  Information  Age.  And  I  would  contend  a  lot  of 
it  is  because  we  are  not  delivering  broadband  to  our  people.  And 
I  would  also  contend  that  having  access  to  broadband  in  even  the 
most rural areas of our country is just as important as getting that 
electricity to them, and therefore that air conditioning to them was 
back  in  the  1940s  and  the  1950s  and  for  some  even  up  into  the 
1960s. 

So,  Commissioner  Copps,  when  you  talk  about  a  broad  national 
strategy, I could not agree more. I think we have to work together 
with  the  private  sector,  in  the  public  sector,  to  have  a  public/pri-
vate  strategy  to  make  sure  that  the  rural  areas  of  our  country 
aren’t left behind, because if we don’t, in this Information Age, not 
only  will  we  not  keep  closing  that  per  capita  income  gap,  we’re 
going  to  see  that  gap  start  to  grow  and  continue  to  grow.  And  in

essence,  we’re  going  to  be  back  where  we  were  in  the  rural  South 
before World War II. Thank you for the opportunity. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Nelson follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REX NELSON, ALTERNATE FEDERAL CO-CHAIRMAN, 

DELTA REGIONAL AUTHORITY 

Senator Pryor, Commissioner Copps, Commissioner Adelstein: It is an honor to be 
asked testify this morning. We are happy to be a part of this important discussion. 
The  Delta  Regional  Authority  is  a  Federal-state  partnership  that  serves  240  coun-
ties and parishes in parts of Arkansas, Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mis-
sissippi,  Missouri  and  Tennessee.  We  operate  a  highly  successful  grant  program  in 
each  of  the  eight  states  we  serve.  This  program  allows  cash-strapped  cities  and 
counties  to  leverage  money  from  other  sources.  The  DRA  also  has  expanded  its  re-
gional  initiatives  the  areas  of  information  technology,  transportation  and  health 
care. 

Earlier  this  year,  the  Delta  Regional  Authority  unveiled  an  information  tech-
nology  plan  for  the  region.  This  plan,  which  has  been  presented  to  the  President 
and  Congress,  was  developed  in  conjunction  with  Southern  Growth  Policies  Board. 
We hope to build information technology access and utilization in Arkansas and the 
other  states  we  serve.  The  plan  is  titled  ‘‘iDelta:  Information  Technology  in  the 
Delta,’’  and  its  goals  are  to  improve  education,  enhance  entrepreneurship  and  im-
prove health care through the use of information technology. 

Southern Growth Policies Board is a public policy think thank based in Research 
Triangle Park in North Carolina. Formed by the region’s Governors in 1971, South-
ern  Growth  Policies  Board  researches  and  develops  economic  development  policies. 
The  region  is  provided  with  authoritative  research,  discussion  forums  and  pilot 
projects in the areas of technology and innovation, globalization, workforce develop-
ment, community development, civic engagement and leadership. 

The plan developed by DRA and Southern Growth Policies Board includes numer-
ous recommendations. An estimated 15 percent of zip codes in the DRA region lack 
high-speed  Internet  services,  compared  with  12  percent  nationally.  In  rural  areas 
of the Delta, the lack of services grew to almost 18 percent. 

What  we’ve  tried  to  accomplish  with  this  plan  is  to  provide  a  map  for  expanding 
information technology in the region. Information technology is as critical to the ad-
vancement  of  the  Delta  as  good  highways.  We  would  never  dream  of  limiting  the 
access  of  drivers  to  publicly  funded  highways.  By  the  same  token,  we  must  make 
sure  people  have  access  to  the  information  highways.  There  are,  of  course,  dif-
ferences  between  highways  and  information  technology.  The  nation  and  the  states 
have  large  agencies  dedicated  to  the  planning,  funding,  construction  and  mainte-
nance of highway systems. No such unified system exists for telecommunications ac-
cess. Responsibility is widely scattered. 

We  also  teach  driving  skills  in  this  country.  But  we  don’t  exhibit  the  same  drive 
to teach technology skills. And roads don’t come in as many radically different forms 
as  is  the  case  with  telecommunications  access.  People  can  choose  from  a  tele-
communications  menu  that  consists  of  cable,  home  lines,  wireless,  satellite  and 
more. 

Only 15 percent of local governments in the region have a website, compared with 
24  percent  of  U.S.  municipalities.  Delta  school  districts  with  a  website  lag  the  na-
tional  rate,  54.2  percent  to  62.2  percent.  Only  13  percent  of  the  240  counties  and 
parishes  have  schools  with  community  technology  centers  available  after  school 
hours.  Just  37  percent  of  communities  in  the  region  have  public  technology  centers 
outside of schools and libraries. 

One of our key recommendations is the creation of a DRA iDelta Center that will 
act as an organizing entity for information technology initiatives in the region. This 
recommendation  is  based  on  successful  models  that  already  exist  in  the  South. 
Other  iDelta  recommendations  include  funding  telecommunications  projects  to  con-
nect  the  region  with  critical  assets  in  health,  education,  workforce  training,  e-com-
merce  and  entrepreneurship;  conducting  a  public  affairs  campaign  on  the  value  of 
technology;  and  funding  local  development  districts  to  use  GIS  systems  to  support 
the DRA’s regional initiatives. 

During a planning retreat in February 2005, the DRA board voted to make health 
care,  transportation  and  information  technology  the  agency’s  major  policy  develop-
ment  areas.  Last  year,  the  DRA  launched  the  Healthy  Delta  initiative,  http:// 
www.healthydelta.com.  In  Feburary,  we  unveiled  plans  for  the  Delta  Development 
Highway  System.  The  proposed  system  consists  of  3,843  miles  of  roads  throughout 
the  region.  The  estimated  cost  to  complete  the  planned  improvement  projects  for

these  roads  is  $18.5  billion.  In  April,  we  released  a  detailed  study  that  identifies 
sites in the region where oil refining facilities can be placed. Such a facility has not 
been built in this country since 1976. Taken together, the highway plan, our health 
care  initiative,  the  oil  refinery  plan  and  the  information  technology  plan  provide  a 
blueprint  for  the  economic  revitalization  of  the  region.  We  take  our  role  as  a  re-
gional  planner,  coordinator  and  advocate  seriously.  The  release  of  this  information 
technology plan is a major step in the life of the authority. 

The  DRA  would  like  to  be  a  unifying  force  in  this  region  when  it  comes  to  infor-
mation  technology.  This  fits  into  our  mandated  role  as  a  regional  coordinator.  No 
one  is  doing  this  for  information  technology  in  the  region.  We  want  to  step  up  and 
help  fill  that  gap.  A  wave  of  information  technology  investment  is  as  necessary  for 
the future of the Delta as great highway construction projects. 

For  more  than  a  decade,  economic  development  officials  have  been  ringing  the 
alarm  about  the  region’s  lack  of  information  technology  access.  To  change  this  con-
versation  and  the  region’s  reality,  there  must  be  significant  new  strategic  invest-
ments  in  information  infrastructure  and  resources.  Our  iDelta  plan  will  provide  a 
tool  for  guiding  the  development  of  such  efforts.  Hopefully,  we  can  craft  Federal 
interagency  agreements  that  will  allow  our  proposed  DRA  iDelta  Center  to  articu-
late and fund the vision of universal access and usage. 

Thank you again for the opportunity to testify. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Thank  you.  Mr.  Burdick,  before  you  say  a  word, 
I  will  note  that  on  my  way  in,  we  stopped  in  this  library.  We  saw 
computers after computer there. And I know the librarians around 
the  state  made  a  serious  commitment  to  technology  in  providing 
public  access  to  the  Internet  and  to  technology  generally,  so  go 
ahead. 

STATEMENT OF DAVID BURDICK, DIRECTOR, PINE BLUFF/ 

JEFFERSON COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM; ON BEHALF OF 

ARKANSAS PUBLIC LIBRARIES 

Mr. BURDICK. Thank you for noting that. Senator Pryor, Commis-
sioners,  I’m  honored  to  come  before  you  today  and  appreciate  the 
opportunity  to  speak  on  behalf  of  the  public  libraries  in  Arkansas. 
My name is Dave Burdick. I’m the Director of the Pine Bluff/Jeffer-
son  County  Library  System.  Pine  Bluff  is  located  45  miles  south-
east  of  Little  Rock  where  the  pine  trees  end  and  the  delta  farm-
lands  begin.  We  have  five  public  libraries  serving  a  population  of 
82,000 people. Fifty-five percent of the population is black. Twenty 
percent of the population is below the poverty line. 

Although nearly all public libraries in Arkansas are connected to 
the Internet, there are many of the small rural libraries where this 
connection  is  through  dial-up,  a  dedicated  56k  line,  a  DSL  line,  or 
a connection through a local cable television network. 

Today, public libraries are a technological center for many of our 
citizens  who  either  cannot  afford  to  own  a  computer  or  afford  to 
pay  for  a  high-speed  connection  to  the  Internet.  The  Pine  Bluff  li-
braries are typical of many of the public libraries in Arkansas. One 
out  of  three  people  who  walk  through  our  doors  use  a  public  com-
puter work station. The important thing is this: The public library 
is  their  gateway  to  the  world.  We  offer  this  gateway  to  everyone. 
Yet  in  many  cases,  we’re  letting  our  citizens  down  by  not  offering 
a  fast  and  reliable  connection  to  meet  their  needs.  In  our  two 
smaller  branches,  both  located  in  towns  of  approximately  a  thou-
sand  people,  we  have  a  56k  connection  for  the  three  public  work 
stations and two staff work stations. This is not adequate, and, un-
fortunately,  it’s  typical  of  small,  rural  libraries  throughout  Arkan-
sas.

In  Pine  Bluff,  the  infrastructure  is  such  that  many  citizens  can-
not  get  DSL.  Numerous  times  in  the  past  few  years,  the  Internet 
connection  at  one  of  our  libraries  has  gone  down  simply  because 
the  phone  company  plugged  in  another  new  user  into  antiquated 
equipment, which was not intended to carry this type of load. 

Pine  Bluff  is  an  impoverished  community  compared  to  other 
major cities in Arkansas. And the payback to the investment in the 
infrastructure  is  just  not  there  as  it  is  in  other  markets.  It  is  like 
this throughout the rural areas of Arkansas, especially in the Delta 
region.  It  is  my  belief  that  the  government  must  step  in  and  offer 
incentives  to  help  improve  the  infrastructure  of  these  poor  and 
rural  areas.  I  envision  the  day  when  every  public  library  through-
out the state is connected to the Internet at a speed which will pro-
vide  all  of  our  citizens  access  to  video-conferences,  live  online  edu-
cational  programs,  live  classroom  instruction,  and  other  resources 
which  take  a  great  deal  of  bandwidth.  Internet  sessions  should  be 
dependent  on  the  current  speed  of  the  Internet  and  not  the  speed 
of  the  network  which  connects  the  citizens  to  the  Internet.  When 
we  talk  broadband  as  it  pertains  to  public  libraries,  we  should  be 
talking about speeds which can reach 100 megabits per second. We 
need to move away from frame relay and move towards a long dis-
tance  Ethernet  or  fiber  optics  network,  so  that  our  citizens  can 
have quick access to our educational institutions. 

You are here today because we all recognize that Arkansas is far 
behind  the  rest  of  the  country  in  broadband  services.  Let’s  just  be 
sure  that  everyone  agrees  that  the  public  libraries  of  Arkansas 
must be included in all discussions and that solutions are found to 
bring  Arkansas  and  Arkansas  public  libraries  up  to  speed.  Thank 
you.

Commissioner COPPS. Can I ask a quick question? 
Mr. BURDICK. Yes, please. 
Commissioner  COPPS.  Do  you  have  any  figures  or  data  on  what 
percentage  of  libraries  maybe  are  on  dial-up?  You  know,  we  have 
the  E-Rate  program  for  schools  and  libraries.  We’re  all  very  proud 
of  that,  and  I’m  a  strong  supporter  of  it.  There  are  those  who  say, 
well,  you’ve  got  93  percent  of  the  classrooms  in  the  United  States 
connected, but a lot of them are dial-up, aren’t they? 

Mr. BURDICK. The data that I’ve seen lately is a little old because 
the state library does collect that, but because so many are starting 
to  move  out  away  from  the  state-offered  services,  it’s  really  hard 
to  know  exactly  where  each  of  those  are.  I  do  know  by  talking  to 
other  librarians  that  they  have  branches  in  these  small  areas, 
which  are  definitely  on  dial-up.  I  have  no  idea  how—or  what  the 
number is. 

Commissioner  COPPS.  That’s  a  lot  to  expect  our  kids  to  compete 
on a dial-up connection with folks everywhere else that have high- 
speed. 

Mr. BURDICK. That is correct.

provider,  but  I’m  also  Director  of  the  Center  for  Distance  Health 
at UAMS and Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gyn-
ecology.  And  I’ll  start  by  saying,  where  you  live  should  not  deter-
mine whether you live or die. That is the case. And as a healthcare 
provider,  it’s  my  mission  to  eliminate  this  disparity.  It’s  unaccept-
able,  and  we  should  eliminate  it.  Information  is  available  and 
needs—your  information  and  special  care  can  eliminate  many  of 
these  deaths.  So  every  day  that  we  don’t  do  this,  there  are  people 
dying unnecessarily. So that’s why I think it’s really important.

Arkansas is the sixth poorest state in the Nation. We are among 
the  worst  nationally  for  stroke  mortality,  women’s  health,  obesity, 
health  insurance  coverage,  cardiovascular  deaths,  and  overall 
health. And unfortunately, there is a long list of other problems we 
have.  While  we  have  made  progress  in  the  last  few  years  in  im-
proving  this,  there  is  a  lot  more  room  for  improvement.  A  few 
months  ago,  we  formed  Arkansas  Telehealth  Network.  And  this  is 
an historical alliance of 16 of Arkansas’ leading health care organi-
zation,  has  been  realized  as  Arkansas  formed  the  Arkansas  Tele-
health Oversight and Management Board—ATOM. 

ATOM  is  called  to  the  duty  to  fully  connect,  tactically  expand, 
and  officially  manage  the  statewide  telehealth  system  that  builds 
upon  the  state’s  educational  and  clinical  efforts.  You  may  wonder 
why  that’s  important  to  do  this  as  a  healthcare  provider.  And  I’ll 
tell  you  that  73  of  the  75  counties  in  Arkansas  are  considered 
medically  under-served.  With  that,  Little  Rock  is  the  home  to  the 
vast  majority  of  the  state’s  only  subspecialists  making  subspecial-
ists’  care  concentrated  away  from  the  rural  areas  where  they’re 
most  needed.  This  is  true  of  many  states,  not  just  Arkansas,  as 
well. It’s hard to get subspecialists to go to rural areas. 

Unique to Arkansas, all hospitals throughout this state are wired 
and  ready  for  the  telehealth  network  due  to  bio-terrorism  grants 
that  we  got.  So  I  want  to  make  a  pitch  for  the  FCC  grant—we 
should  get  that,  we  need  it  very  much.  We  could  make  dramatic 
improvements in a very short time. ATOM identifies and leverages 
existing  resources  to  make  the  most  efficient  use  of  funding  and 
technology  since  we  already  have  the,  sort  of  the  infrastructure  in 
place.  ATOM  plans  to  update,  expand,  and  connect  all  hospitals 
and other health care organizations to build a unified state virtual 
telehealthcare network that includes all hospitals and all providers. 
By doing this subspecialty support through telehealth enables us to 
oversee  every  patient  transition  from  point-of-care  from  rural 
areas,  to  the  cities,  and  back  and  forth,  so  that  the  patient  is  not 
a patient in the large hospital, but is a patient of everybody in the 
state.  So  if  you  transfer  a  patient,  it’s  still  your  patient,  and  vice 
versa. 

We can expect more cost savings and a diversity of disciplines as 
a result of this. Reaching telemedicine to rural Arkansas can stim-
ulate  workforce  development,  keeping  telehealth  dollars  in  rural 
towns  that  need  them  the  most.  We  may  be  poor  and  we  may  not 
have a good health care standing as other states. What we do have 
is  a  network  of  telehealthcare  providers  focused  on  improving  Ar-
kansas through a unified statewide initiative. 

Arkansas  is  rich  in  one  area:  a  passion  to  overcome  our  short-
comings  with  the  intellectual  and  technological  infrastructure  re-
quired  to  implement  the  Arkansas  Telehealth  Network.  The  sup-
port  of  the  FCC,  and  you,  Senator  Pryor,  can  make  this  vision  for 
the future come to fruition. Thank you for your desire to make Ar-
kansas a better and eventually the best state in the Union for tele-
health. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CURTIS L. LOWERY, JR., M.D., CHAIRMAN, DEPARTMENT OF 
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY;  DIRECTOR,  CENTER FOR DISTANCE HEALTH, 
UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES (UAMS) 

UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES (UAMS) 

PRESENTATION TO THE LEGISLATURE 

Arkansas Telehealth Network 

(FCC WC Docket No. 02–60) 

Overarching Theme 

Where  you  live  should  not  determine  whether  you  live  or  die.  That  sentiment  re-
sounds  in  the  mission  of  Arkansas’  healthcare  providers.  In  a  state  where  73  of  75 
counties  are  considered  medically  underserved,  healthcare  access  is  the  most  over-
whelming  reason  for  Arkansas’  poor  health  standing.  Faced  with  a  statewide  crisis 
in nearly every measurable healthcare category, an alliance of healthcare providers 
has  sought  to  demonstrate  that  through  collaboration  and  technology  Arkansas  is 
a place to live—not die. 
How do we plan to achieve this? 

In response to the FCC Rural Health Care Pilot Program, the State of Arkansas, 
in  a  historical  feat,  has  allied  its  major  healthcare  service  organizations  and  stake-
holders,  building  the  framework  for  a  fully-connected,  tactically-expanded,  and  effi-
ciently-managed statewide telehealth system. This partnership of healthcare organi-
zations  is  realized  through  the  Arkansas  Telehealth  Oversight  and  Management 
(ATOM) Board, with a current membership of 16 organizations and an open invita-
tion to all others interested in improving Arkansas’ telehealth resources. With FCC 
assistance, ATOM will create the Arkansas Telehealth Network. 

ATOM is comprised of a diverse group of Arkansas healthcare organizations oper-

ating statewide, including the following agencies: 
• University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. 
• Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services. 
• Baptist Health. 
• Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. 
• Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. 
• Arkansas Department of Information Systems. 
• Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care. 
• Arkansas Hospital Association. 
• Arkansas Office of Information Technology. 
• Arkansas Research & Education Optical Network. 
• Community Health Centers of Arkansas. 
• DaySpring Behavioral Health. 
• Delta Regional Authority. 
• Mental Health Council of Arkansas. 
• St. Vincent Health System. 
• Training, Research in Aging and Children Services (TRACS). 
• And others as they choose to join. 
As selected by the ATOM Board, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences 
(UAMS)  serves  as  the  legal  and  financial  applicant  seeking  FCC  funding.  Through 
an innovative management plan and statewide collaboration and support, this pilot 
program will revolutionize the composition, interoperability, and management of Ar-
kansas’  telehealth  efforts.  A  total  request  of  $5,054,988  and  an  accompanying  hard 
cash match of $837,300 will achieve goals of consolidation, expansion, and manage-
ment of the Arkansas Telehealth Network. 
Why Arkansas? 

Arkansas  is  in  the  state  of  need.  Results  from  the  United  Health  Foundation’s 
2006  survey  of  national  health  standings  reveal  Arkansas  currently  ranks  in  the 
bottom five states in the Nation. Measuring a gamut of risk factors on personal be-
haviors,  community  environment,  public  and  health  policies,  and  health  outcomes, 
Arkansas  is  46th  out  of  50  states  in  overall  health  status.  To  complicate  matters,

Arkansas’  status  continues  to  hover  in  a  declining  pattern,  having  dropped  from 
45th  placement  in  1990.  Among  Arkansas’  measured  qualities,  the  following  health 
outcomes  contribute  to  this  extremely  poor  ranking,  while  dually  serving  the  pur-
pose of highlighting Arkansas’ need for improved medical services and interventions: 
• Arkansas ranks 46th out of 50 states in premature death; years lost per 100,000 

population: 9,587. 

births: 8.1. 

• Arkansas  ranks  41st  out  of  50  states  in  infant  mortality;  deaths  per  1,000  live 

• Arkansas  ranks  44th  out  of  50  states  in  cardiovascular  death;  deaths  per 

cent. 

100,000 population: 376.4. 

• Arkansas  ranks  44th  out  of  50  states  in  obesity;  percent  of  population:  28  per-

• Arkansas  ranks  44th  and  45th  out  of  50  states  for  poor  physical  health  days 
and poor mental health days respectively; days in previous 30 days: 4.1 in poor 
physical  health  and  3.7  in  poor  mental  health  (Unitedhealthfoundation.org, 
2006). 

The  University  of  Arkansas’  Division  of  Agriculture  explains  in  its  2005  Rural 
Profile of Arkansas 63 of Arkansas’ 75 counties are considered non-metropolitan and 
consequently  rural.  As  the  report  further  highlights,  the  2000  Census  identified  48 
percent of Arkansans as rural, compared to the nation, where only 21 percent were 
considered  rural  at  the  time  of  the  2000  census.  Arkansas  is  also  experiencing  a 
boom  in  the  state’s  Hispanic  population,  with  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  reporting  a 
337  percent  increase  between  the  1990  and  2000  Census.  According  to  the  Urban 
Institute,  Arkansas’  Hispanic  population  grew  48  percent  between  2000  and  2005, 
the fastest growth of any state in the Nation. As home to significant, growing popu-
lations from Mexico, Central America, and the Marshall Islands, there is a need for 
language translation services. Ranked 7th in the Nation for percent of people living 
at or below poverty in 2005, Arkansas is not only rural; it is poor. 

Arkansas  must  expand  and  improve  its  telehealth  resources  to  better  serve  its 
rural  population.  Concerns  related  to  building  and  expanding  the  existing  network 
encompasses problems in affordability of telehealth connectivity. Regarding the cur-
rent  telehealth  networks,  several  issues  exist  to  prompt  the  need  to  enhance  net-
work  interoperability.  Presently,  Arkansas  is  home  to  three  statewide  telehealth 
networks:  DHHS,  UAMS,  and  Baptist  Health,  among  a  number  of  smaller,  private 
networks.  These  three  telehealth  networks  represent  all  areas  of  the  state,  serving 
consumers  on  a  variety  of  levels  including  emergency  preparedness  (earthquake, 
pandemic  flu,  chemical  spill,  etc.),  high-risk  pregnancy  consultation,  diabetes  self- 
management,  health  care  education,  home  health,  cardiology,  psychiatry,  and  a 
number  of  other  diverse  medical  applications.  The  networks  also  serve  to  educate 
providers across Arkansas, with health care meetings, continuing education opportu-
nities,  and  other  collaborative  uses  of  teleconferencing.  The  co-existing  networks 
have  served  many  patients  throughout  Arkansas,  yet  these  networks  all  function 
separately  from  one  another,  serving  the  same  target  population  with  needed  serv-
ices.  The  current  telehealth  network’s  greatest  flaws  are  their  inability  to  easily 
communicate  with  one  another  and  lack  of  a  centralized,  scheduling  and  manage-
ment system. Through this initiative, ATOM will seek to overcome these flaws. 

The proposed statewide telehealth network will be created through three methods: 
(1) Consolidation of sites that currently exist on separate networks, (2) Update and 
Addition of sites in need of increased bandwidth and improved accessibility, and (3) 
Expansion  of  the  network  to  include  access  to  Internet2  and  the  Arkansas  Inter-
active Video Network. 
What deliverables are expected? 

The  ATOM  Board  proposes  several  related  efforts  and  resultant  deliverables 
through  this  pilot  program  proposal,  each  aimed  at  aggregating  the  needs  of  the 
state’s  health  care  providers  and  leveraging  existing  technology.  These  efforts  are 
explained below. 

• Effort 1: Consolidate Arkansas’ existing public and private non-profit telehealth 

networks into one statewide Arkansas Telehealth Network. 
Deliverable: Cohesive statewide telehealth network. 

• Effort 2: Expand the Arkansas Telehealth Network to strategically enhance ac-
cess  to  rural,  underserved  areas  and  populations  of  Arkansas  to  include  a  spe-
cial emphasis on the Delta region. 
Deliverable: A more comprehensive statewide telehealth network.

25 

• Effort  3:  Unite  the  Arkansas  Telehealth  Network  to  Arkansas’  Educational 

Video Network. 
Deliverable:  Interoperability  between  the  state’s  educational  (520  endpoints)  and 
telehealth resources (∼270 endpoints). 

• Effort 4: Connect the Arkansas Telehealth Network to Internet2 and Arkansas’ 

fiber backbone. 
Deliverable: A fully connected statewide telehealth network with statewide access 
to the latest technologies and applications. 

• Effort  5:  Manage  and  schedule  the  24/7  needs  of  the  Arkansas  Telehealth  Net-

work. 
Deliverable: A well-communicative network, with ease in scheduling and trouble-
shooting to encourage continued and frequent telehealth use. 

• Effort  6:  Evaluate  the  success  of  the  proposed  initiatives  on  a  scheduled  and 

continual basis. 
Deliverable: Evidence of the success of the pilot program for dissemination, pub-
lishing, and further replication of a model program. 

How will this effort be managed? 

The  management  plan  of  this  initiative  stems  from  a  collaborative  approach  be-
tween  ATOM  Board  members.  The  ATOM  Board  is  currently  comprised  of  16 
partnering health care organizations, and other governmental or private, non-profit 
health or technology organizations are invited to join the Board. 

Membership in the ATOM Board is open to any health or technology-related orga-
nization  (governmental,  private  non-profit,  or  private-for-profit).  Membership  is  in-
tended to promote broad access and advocacy for telehealth services. Members elect 
representation to the ATOM Advisory Committee. UAMS will work under the direc-
tion  of  ATOM  members  through  the  ATOM  Board.  All  members  will  participate  in 
decision-making and management. 
What are our past successes? 

ATOM’s  day-to-day  operations  will  be  led  by  three  organizations:  the  University 
of  Arkansas  for  Medical  Sciences,  Baptist  Health,  and  the  Arkansas  Department  of 
Health,  each  with  extensive  telemedicine  histories.  As  depicted  below,  each  organi-
zation has been instrumental in bringing telemedicine to rural Arkansas. 
UAMS (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences) 

Pioneered Arkansas’ first telehealth system in 1991. 
Created  an  award-winning,  cost-efficient  Medicaid-funded  obstetrical  telehealth 

Delivers  telehealth  consultation  in  genetics,  oncology,  neonatology,  psychology, 

program. 

education, etc. 
Baptist Health 

First in Arkansas and region to implement an eICU providing remote monitoring 

of Critical Care patients (2005). 

Constructed a home health telehealth program for patient monitoring. 
Provides  remote  teleradiology  and  sleep  study  patient  assessment  and  consulta-

tion to rural hospitals. 
DHHS (Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services) 

Operates Arkansas’ emergency preparedness telehealth system. 
Supplies clinical and educational telehealth to providers and patients. 
Launched  a  telehealth  network  serving  rural  health  clinics,  critical  access  hos-

pitals, and the state’s hospitals. 

The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences will provide the overall manage-
ment  of  the  ATOM  effort,  while  also  acting  as  the  legal  applicant  for  FCC  Rural 
Health  Care  Pilot  Program  funding.  Thus,  this  organization’s  qualifications  are  ex-
plained  in  greater  detail.  UAMS  has  years  of  experience  in  developing  and  man-
aging telemedicine programs. Technical and organizational ability to implement this 
pilot  program  is  evidenced  by  the  fact  that  the  UAMS  Statewide  Telehealth  Net-
work  has  grown  to  include  more  than  50  self-sustaining  sites.  As  an  overview  of 
UAMS’  programmatic  achievements  in  telemedicine,  UAMS’  Rural  Hospital  and 
Antenatal  &  Neonatal  Guidelines,  Education  and  Learning  System  (ANGELS)  pro-
grams are explained. These two programs led the University’s and consequently the 
state’s  efforts  in  telehealth.  Further,  leaders  from  both  organizations  will  continue 
to play instrumental roles in this pilot program effort through ATOM.

The  UAMS  Rural  Hospital  Program  (RHP)  led  the  state’s  efforts  in  telehealth 
when  it  was  established  in  1991  with  two  sites,  having  grown  to  include  50  rural 
hospital,  Area  Health  Education  Center  (AHEC),  and  clinic  sites  across  the  state. 
The primary aim of the network is to share UAMS resources to increase timely ac-
cess to specialty services and information in rural settings that would not otherwise 
be  available.  The  program  has  extended  telehealth  services  into  some  of  the  most 
rural and needy regions of Arkansas. With over 15 years of experience creating tele-
medicine sites, training facilitators, and developing compressed video programs and 
presentations,  the  RHP  has  worked  with  numerous  communities  and  a  variety  of 
facilities throughout Arkansas to develop the statewide network. In 2006, RHP held 
272  different  continuing  education  programs  over  telemedicine,  serving  5,820  at-
tending  healthcare  professionals.  Further,  RHP  offered  34  different  consumer  edu-
cation  programs  broadcasted  through  telemedicine  in  2006,  with  614  consumers  in 
attendance. 

local  physicians,  and  UAMS  physicians 

The  ANGELS  program  is  an  innovative  Medicaid-funded,  telehealth  consultation 
and  education  service  established  in  2003  for  a  wide  range  of  physicians  including 
family  practitioners,  obstetricians,  neonatologists,  and  pediatricians  in  Arkansas. 
Utilizing  interactive  compressed  video  and  Level  II  ultrasonography,  telemedicine 
conferences enable physicians to confer with Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialists re-
garding  high-risk  pregnant  patients.  Clinical  telemedicine  consultations  allow  pa-
tients, 
review 
ultrasonography  results  in  real  time,  bringing  the  state’s  only  certified  Maternal- 
Fetal  Medicine  subspecialty  support  directly  to  hometowns.  In  support  of  its  tele-
medicine  services,  ANGELS  established  a  call  center  to  direct  24/7  support  to  pa-
tients and providers needing evidence-based triage and guidance. In 2006, ANGELS 
performed  891  consultations  through  ANGELS  telemedicine,  a  marked  increase 
from its pre-implementation rate of 174 consultations in 2002. 
What long-term consequences may result?

to 

Through  implementation  of  Arkansas  Telehealth  Network,  rural  Arkansas  can 
overcome  the  distance  barrier  that  separates  its  rural  residents  from  the  sub-
specialty  care  they  need.  This  network  provides  the  very  foundation  required  to 
build  a  comprehensive  plan  to  tackle  the  state’s  laundry  list  of  health  adversities. 
A  centrally-managed,  comprehensively-collaborative  telehealth  network  will  allow 
opportunities to build any number of programs: behavioral health services, telephar-
macy programs, emergency-based stroke networks, and a continuing list of possibili-
ties. What may result? Arkansas may transcend its poor health standing. Arkansans 
will  have  increased  access  to  the  care  they  need  to  prevent,  maintain,  and  improve 
their  health.  This  project  builds  upon  relationships,  technology,  and  support  within 
the healthcare community, with one unifying theme held by all the ATOM member-
ship: Help Arkansas help itself. 

Mr.  ADELSTEIN.  Chairman,  a  quick  question.  I  know  about  the 
grant. We’re going to give it—we’re going to take a hard look at it. 
We have an ongoing program, as you know, that Congress enacted 
in the rural telehealth program, part of universal service. I’m won-
dering  if  ATOM  is  participating  in  the  FCC’s  E-Rate  program  for 
some help. 

Dr.  LOWERY.  Yes,  we  do,  but  many  of  the  hospitals  aren’t  really 
eligible for it. We already get a good rate in the state already—the 
telehealth companies, so it ends up not really saving a lot of money 
for us in this state. 

Mr.  ADELSTEIN.  Is  there  something  we  need  to  do  to  make  it 

more helpful in the ongoing program? 

Dr.  LOWERY.  Well,  yes,  I  mean,  I  guess  it  would  be  to  make  it 
so  that  more  hospitals  could  apply  for  it  and  take  advantage  of  it, 
I  guess,  would  be  the  issue.  I  mean,  you  know,  $500  doesn’t  seem 
like a lot of money, but for small hospitals that are barely making 
it,  it’s  $500.  So  the  more  hospitals  we  have  onboard,  the  better  off 
that we are. We’ve had—in our network at UAMS many of the hos-
pitals dropped off because of the costs of the T–1 lines. I know that 
seems strange, but that’s the reality.

Senator PRYOR. And just by way of background for the two Com-
missioners,  UAMS  is  the  University  of  Arkansas  for  Medical 
Sciences,  part  of  the  University  of  Arkansas  system,  so  it’s  our 
medical school. They do a lot of medical research there, and they’re 
very plugged in a lot of different ways. And it’s a great asset to the 
state, because in many specialty areas, you can get state-of-the-art 
care  throughout  the  state.  Now,  it  also  has  a  hospital,  so  it’s  a 
large  hospital  as  well,  and  it  has  what  we  call  the  AHEC  system, 
which is sort of distance clinics. I’m not quite sure—— 

Dr. LOWERY. Yes, that’s right. 
Senator  PRYOR.—how  you  describe  it,  but  clinics  around  the 
state.  And  the  idea  was  years  ago  to  try  to  get  some  of  those  spe-
cialties  and  some  subspecialties  out  into  rural  Arkansas  where 
folks  can  get,  again,  world-class  care,  and  have  access  to  world- 
class physicians. 

Dr.  LOWERY.  The  population  density  just  won’t  support  a  pedi-
atric  nephrologist  in  Mena,  Arkansas,  but  you  can  have  this  infor-
mation available through these technologies to consult with guys in 
the rural areas that need this resource. So it’s sort of like the Inter-
net of health care in a way, right? 

Senator  PRYOR.  Yes.  And  also  UAMS  works  very,  very  closely 
with  Arkansas  Children’s  Hospital  and  also  to  a  large  extent  with 
the VA Hospital, which is right on the edge of the parking lot, real-
ly.  They  almost  share  space.  But  that’s  the  way  Arkansas  has  ap-
proached  health  care.  It  has  been  a  real  pillar  in  our  healthcare 
system here for a long time. 

Dr.  LOWERY.  I  want  to  make  one  thing  clear,  though,  that  this 

proposal, the ATOM group is made up of other hospitals—— 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Dr. LOWERY.—Baptist, St. Vincent’s, and all the hospitals around 
the  state.  And  I  don’t  think  that  this  network  should  be  limited, 
and in no way we’ve ever said that to just UAMS. This is designed 
to  be  a  virtual  health  care  network  for  all  hospitals  to  participate, 
and that’s the way it should be. 

Senator PRYOR. Yes. I think that’s a great point. But other states 
may  do  it  differently,  right?  That’s  the  way  Arkansas  has  done  it. 
Here  again,  one  size  fits  all  may  not  work  for  us,  because  we’ve 
taken  a  certain  approach,  which  has  been  great  for  our  state.  And 
we were very collaborative. Our approach here in Arkansas was to 
always work with each other and try to help any way we can. That 
may  not  be  true  in  other  states,  bigger  cities,  whatever,  but  that 
has certainly been our approach. Mr. Mjartan?

to  bring  broadband  into  some  of  our  communities  that  are  really 
very small and distressed. Our flagship project is in Phillips Coun-
ty, Arkansas, which is the poorest county in the state of Arkansas. 
It has about a 30 percent poverty rate. And one of the greatest ob-
stacles we’ve seen in reaching the outlying areas in Phillips County 
has  been  really  a  lack  of  the  digital  infrastructure  and  a  problem 
that  really  makes  these  communities  competing  in  the  21st  cen-
tury, global knowledge-based economy impossible. And one example 
that I gave to the Commissioner last night was when I drive to the 
Delta and want to visit with some of our communities—the best ex-
ample  is  the  mayor  of  Lakeview.  I  can  send  her  a  fax,  or  I  can 
drive  there  on  our  asphalt  infrastructure  that’s  been  developed. 
But  to  borrow  Rex’s  analogy,  I  cannot  use  the  digital  infrastruc-
ture. So we’ve done a great job building asphalt physical infrastruc-
ture, but in the 21st century, we feel that the digital infrastructure 
is  just  as  important  as  the  physical  asphalt  and  concrete  infra-
structure of the 20th century. 

One of the programs that we have some experience with that has 
been  widely  successful  I  would  argue  in  other  parts  of  the  country 
has  been  the  USDA’s  Community  Connect  Broadband  program. 
And  this  program  has  served  many  communities,  but  not  a  single 
community  in  Arkansas  has  successfully  applied  and  received  this 
grant. And I’d like to use this venue to make two recommendations 
that I think would make it much more likely for Arkansas commu-
nities  to  benefit  from  this  fantastic  program.  One  of  them  is  eligi-
bility criteria, which some of you have referred to it as zip code re-
quirement,  but  it’s  a  similar  issue  that  really  excludes  many  com-
munities  that  have  a  single  household  with  broadband  access  dis-
qualified.  So  what  we  would  like  to  propose  is  to  change  the  re-
quirement  that  at  least  50  percent  of  the  households  in  a  commu-
nity must have access to broadband in order to be disqualified from 
receiving  this  grant.  And  number  two,  you  know,  we’ve  run  into 
this  challenge  most  recently  where  for-profit  providers  in  geo-
graphically-dispersed  rural  areas  really  cannot  make  this  project 
under the grant sustainable past a two-year cycle. 

So  what  we  would  like  to  propose  is  to  extend  the  cycle  to  give 
these  for-profit  providers  a  chance  to  gain  enough  customer  base 
and  start  recovering  the  very  high  fixed  costs  that  they  incur  in 
bringing broadband to rural areas. 

And then finally I have a third point here. I’ve found out recently 
that  the  USDA  has  been  very  responsive  and  answered  this  chal-
lenge,  which  was  an  income  requirement  that  was  based  on  na-
tional  income.  Now  it’s  based  on  state  median  income,  and  we’re 
very  pleased  to  see  that  the  USDA  is  so  responsive  to  our  needs. 
So finally I just want to conclude by really summarizing what ev-
eryone has said that we really feel that without high quality digital 
infrastructure, our communities will be unable to survive and com-
pete  in  the  global  economy  of  the  21st  century.  And  I  really  thank 
you for your leadership in coming to Arkansas, discussing this, and 
I  applaud  you  for  seeking  additional  ways  that  we  can  provide  all 
of  our  citizens  a  chance  to  improve  their  lives,  to  learn  to  prosper 
and compete in the 21st century. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DOMINIK MJARTAN, VICE PRESIDENT, 

SOUTHERN FINANCIAL PARTNERS 

Thank  you  for  allowing  me  the  opportunity  to  testify  about  the  dire  need  for  im-
proved  digital  infrastructure  in  our  rural  areas.  My  name  is  Dominik  Mjartan,  and 
I  serve  as  Vice  President  of  Southern  Financial  Partners,  a  comprehensive  commu-
nity  development  organization  affiliated  with  Southern  Bancorp  (‘‘Southern’’),  the 
largest rural development bank in America. We operate in several targeted commu-
nities, but our flagship operations are in Phillips County, Arkansas. 

With a poverty rate of 30 percent, Phillips County is the poorest county in Arkan-
sas  and  exemplifies  the  problems  faced  by  rural  areas  throughout  the  state.  It  has 
suffered significant economic and population declines over the past several decades, 
as  the  agricultural  economy  has  undergone  fundamental  changes.  Phillips  County 
has  experienced  a  host  of  other  problems  ranging  from  crumbling  infrastructure  to 
poor  educational  outcomes  that  make  successfully  competing  in  the  21st  century 
knowledge-based economy difficult. Access to high-speed Internet offers a bridge be-
tween past challenges and future success. 

However, most rural areas are completely cutoff from the digital world due to lack 
of broadband. The result is a digital divide that further worsens poverty and related 
issues.  The  most  relevant  and  successful  Federal  program  that  addresses  the  need 
for  increased  broadband  access  in  rural  areas  is  the  USDA’s  Community  Connect 
Broadband  program.  The  Community  Connect  program  has  successfully  brought 
broadband service to communities in other parts of the country, but so far not a sin-
gle Arkansas community has received a grant under Community Connect. While the 
overall structure of the program has the potential to benefit the struggling Arkansas 
communities  Southern  serves,  these  communities  face  several  difficulties  accessing 
the program: 

• A  key  eligibility  criterion  for  the  grant  is  that  no  household  in  the  community 
has  access  to  a  broadband  service.  This  requirement  excludes  many  commu-
nities  that  have  only  minimal  broadband  coverage,  or  whose  coverage  only  in-
cludes higher-income neighborhoods. This also means that broadband providers 
can install a single switch in a community to pre-empt an attempt by a compet-
itor  to  bring  coverage  to  an  area  with  help  from  the  USDA  program,  leaving 
the  community  without  real  broadband  coverage  and  unable  to  access  the 
USDA’s program. 
• Community  Connect  awards  points  based  on  the  economic  need  of  the  targeted 
rural area in a way that does not fully acknowledge the extreme income dispari-
ties  that  exist  in  many  rural  communities.  The  program  awards  points  based 
on per capita income, instead of other measures, such as poverty rate or median 
income, which better reflect the economic hardship of the community. A commu-
nity  like  Lake  View  in  Phillips  County  scores  only  15  out  of  30  possible  points 
in  the  ‘‘economic  need’’  category,  despite  having  a  poverty  rate  of  45  percent, 
an  unemployment  rate  of  30  percent,  and  a  median  income  of  $15,500.  It  is 
worth  noting  that  the  USDA  has  responded  to  this  challenge  and  accordingly 
modified the rules for the upcoming 2008 grant cycle. 
• For-profit  service  providers  are  required  to  apply  for  Community  Connect 
grants,  but  the  grants  don’t  adequately  cover  the  costs  of  bringing  broadband 
to many rural communities—particularly the smallest and most at-risk commu-
nities, which are unable to provide a substantial source of revenue to make the 
project  sustainable  beyond  the  term  of  the  grant.  As  a  result,  service  providers 
lack  the  confidence  to  make  long-term  commitments.  Extending  the  grant  pe-
riod beyond 2 years would improve the cash-flow of these projects. 

These proposed changes would go a long way toward leveling the playing field for 
Arkansas  communities.  Overall,  more  funding  is  needed,  through  this  program  or 
other  Federal  programs,  to  fulfill  the  urgent  need  to  bring  broadband  services  to 
rural areas. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Thank  you.  Dr.  Davis  is  next.  And  Dr.  Davis, 
thank you again for hosting me on your campus earlier this month. 
It  was  great  and  for  you  all  in  the  audience,  he  gave  me  a  great 
history  lesson  on  UAPB,  and  there  are  some  phenomenal  things 
that  have  happened  there  over  the  years.  And  some  of  the  high-
lights of that history and it is one of the premiere historically black 
colleges  and  universities  sites  in  this  country.  So  we’re  certainly 
proud to have him here today.

STATEMENT OF LAWRENCE A. DAVIS, JR., CHANCELLOR, 

UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT PINE BLUFF 

Dr.  DAVIS.  Thank  you  very  much,  Senator.  And  I  appreciate  the 
opportunity to be here today. And certainly, I recognize the distin-
guished Commissioners for being with us today. I’m happy to have 
an opportunity to make comments on what I consider a great chal-
lenge  and  yet  a  great  opportunity.  I’m  Lawrence  A.  Davis,  Jr.,  I’m 
the Chancellor at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. We are 
the second oldest state-supported institution of higher education in 
Arkansas.  We  are  one  of  two  land-grant  institutions.  And  we  are 
the only state-supported HBCU. And our business is the production 
of  human  capital,  and  we’ve  been  in  that  business  over  134  years. 
We label ourselves as the flagship of the Delta. 

Primarily because of our historic mission, providing opportunities 
and  making  a  difference  in  the  Delta,  not  only  in  terms  of  edu-
cational services, but economic development, and I don’t want to go 
into all of that today. But as you’re aware, Arkansas has the dubi-
ous distinction of being ranked in the bottom tiers of several qual-
ity education indicators: student achievement on national examina-
tions, workforce availability, percentage of college graduates, reduc-
tion in the illiteracy rate, and the list goes on. And in my opinion, 
part  of  the  reason  that  we  remain  in  that  position  is  because  we 
have  not  been  able  to  take  advantage  of  broadband  technology. 
Now,  Columbus  proved  that  the  world  was  round,  but  technology 
has  made  the  world  flat.  You  know  what  we  mean  by  saying  that. 
Those of us who are not able to step up to the contemporary levels 
in  technology  will  continue  to  occupy  the  lower  echelons  of  edu-
cational  achievement  and  the  associated  retarded  economic  devel-
opment. 

Now,  although  Arkansas  ranks  low  in  broadband  deployment,  it 
is  encouraging  to  note  that  visionary  leadership  has  developed  a 
plan  in  Arkansas  to  move  us  to  a  more  competitive  position,  at 
least,  the  four-year  public  institutions.  We  have  a  proposed  ARE– 
ON  (Arkansas  Research  and  Education  Optical  Network)  that  will 
move  the  four-year  public  institutions  to  a  position  of  equity  with 
other  states  in  terms  of  research,  the  ability  to  deliver  online  in-
struction,  and  other  functions.  Especially  will  this  be  a  significant 
achievement for the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. Not only 
will it locate us on the frontiers of technology, but also it completes 
our  multi-million  dollar  investment  of  past  years  in  IP  technology. 
At  UAPB  a  few  years  ago,  ten  years  or  so  ago,  we  made  a  major 
investment,  so  our  security  cameras,  our  PCs,  and  our  telephones 
all  travel  along  the  same  Internet  Protocol  lines.  And,  of  course, 
this  will  ensure  UAPB  continues  to  be  one  of  the  few  HBCUs  in 
the  Nation;  Senator,  that  we  can  say  does  not  have  a  technology 
gap.  And  as  you  know,  that’s  an  issue  in  Washington  for  many  of 
our colleagues. 

Also,  our  university  will  be  able  to  expand  the  services  and  op-
portunities  for  citizens,  especially  in  the  Delta,  which  is  a  region, 
as  I  pointed  out,  most  challenged  in  our  state  in  terms  of  edu-
cational  achievements  and  economic  growth.  Now  certainly,  tech-
nology  is  not  a  panacea,  but  it  will  accelerate  our  progress.  When 
you think about what it’s going to cost, reflect on where our Nation 
would  be  if  we  had  not  invested  in  the  interstate  highway  system.

Where would we be today? We wouldn’t be able to move from here 
to  there  as  rapidly  as  we  currently  do.  So  I  think  that  costs  have 
to  be  associated  with  how  much  it  will  cost  us  if  we  don’t  do  it.  I 
believe  that  a  move  into  broadband  technology;  Senator,  is  critical 
to the future of our state.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LAWRENCE A. DAVIS, JR., CHANCELLOR, 

UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT PINE BLUFF 

Arkansas has the dubious distinction of being ranked in the bottom tiers of qual-
ity  education  indicators:  student  achievement  on  national  examinations,  workforce 
availability,  percentage  of  college  graduates  and  reduction  of  illiteracy  rates.  In-
cluded in this list, which may be contributing to the previously identified negatives, 
is the state’s ranking of 47 out of 50 states for broadband deployment. 

The world has become flat because of the explosive development of technology and 
those who have not achieved contemporary technology levels will continue to occupy 
the  lower  echelons  of  educational  achievement  and  the  concomitant  retarded  eco-
nomic development. 

Although Arkansas ranks low in Broadband deployment, it is encouraging to note 
that visionary leadership has developed a plan to move Arkansas to a more competi-
tive  position.  The  proposed  ARE–ON  (Arkansas  Research  and  Education  Optical 
Network) will move the four-year public education institutions to a position of equity 
with  those  in  other  states.  Especially  will  this  be  a  significant  achievement  for  the 
University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB). Not only will it locate us on the fron-
tiers of technology, but also it completes our multi-million dollar investment of past 
years  in  IP  technology.  UAPB  will  be  among  the  few  HBCUs  not  having  a  tech-
nology gap. Also, the University will be able to expand its services and opportunities 
for citizens in the Delta of Arkansas, a region much challenged in the areas of edu-
cational achievement and economic growth. An investment in ARE–ON is critical to 
the future prosperity of the state of Arkansas. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Thank  you.  Dr.  Smith,  I  know  that  the  Univer-
sity  of  Arkansas  years  ago  made  a  big  commitment  to  distance 
learning. 

STATEMENT OF ROBERT V. SMITH, PROVOST, 
VICE CHANCELLOR FOR ACADEMIC AFFAIRS, 
UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS, FAYETTEVILLE 

Mr.  SMITH.  Well,  thank  you,  Senator.  Good  morning  to  Senator 
Pryor  and  Commissioners  Copps  and  Adelstein.  I’m  Bob  Smith.  I 
serve  as  the  Provost  and  Vice  Chancellor  for  Academic  Affairs  at 
the  University  of  Arkansas  in  Fayetteville.  Joining  me  today  is 
David  Merrifield,  who’s  Chief  Technology  Officer  in  the  Depart-
ment  of  Computing  Services  at  the  University.  I  hope  David  will 
stand  up  for  one  moment.  Along  with  David,  Amy  Apon  is  here. 
She’s  a  University  of  Arkansas  Professor  of  Computer  Science  and 
Computer  Engineering,  and  is  director  of  High  Performance  Com-
puting  at  the  university.  The  great  English  novelist  and  play-
wright, John Galsworthy said, ‘‘If you don’t think about the future, 
you  won’t  have  one.’’  And  clearly  you  won’t  have  one  if  we  don’t 
plan well. 

And clearly, there has been a leadership team involving the Uni-
versity  of  Arkansas  at  Fayetteville,  the  University  of  Arkansas 
Medical  Sciences  Center  that  the  Senator  has  so  aptly  described, 
and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock have gotten together, 
working  with  state  agencies,  most  notably  the  Arkansas  Science 
and Technology Authority among others, with private corporations, 
and with our sister institutions in the state of Louisiana, and have

developed,  as  Chancellor  Davis  noted,  the  Arkansas  Research  and 
Education Optical Network, or ARE–ON. This serves the advanced 
computing  needs  in  Arkansas,  and  is  appropriate  for  the  21st  cen-
tury,  meeting  the  educational  and  economic  development  needs, 
particularly  in  rural  areas  of  our  state.  I  have  provided  copies  to 
the  Committee  of  written  testimony,  but  I  want  to  offer  just  very 
briefly  some  specific  observations  and  conclusions.  And  my  col-
leagues are here to help answer any questions that you have. 

In  our  written  testimony,  we  note  that  ARE–ON  is  on  schedule 
with completion anticipated in late Summer of 2008. Red Diamond, 
a  256-processor,  parallel  super  computer  funded  by  the  National 
Science Foundation has been functional at the University of Arkan-
sas at Fayetteville for two years, but now is at capacity. The UALR 
is  in  the  process  of  obtaining  a  similar  parallel  processing  super 
computer  funded  by  NSF  and  EPSCoR.  And  NSF  has  additionally 
funded  the  University  of  Arkansas  at  Fayetteville  to  more  than 
double the size of Red Diamond by an award of $800,000. 

We  are  now  in  the  process  of  identifying  vendors  and  possibly 
leveraging  that  award.  The  plan  is  to  connect  the  two  sets  of  par-
allel processing units when we are all on ARE–ON. And in October, 
a  group  of  high-performance  computer  experts  will  visit  Arkansas 
to  help  with  a  state-wide  plan  and  to  help  us  recapture  a  position 
among  the  500  advanced  computing  operations  in  the  world.  And 
we  note  as  the  Commissioners  and  the  Senator  have  noted,  it’s  al-
ways  a  moving  target,  and  we  tend  to  move  in  the  reverse  some-
times,  but  we’re  going  to  pick  up  the  pace,  and  hopefully  get  back 
into  that  position.  We  do  appreciate  this  opportunity  to  offer  testi-
mony on contributions of the state’s major institutional partners in 
advancing  computer  technology.  We  look  forward  to  answering 
questions that you may have, and Mr. Merrifield and Dr. Apon are 
here  to  help  us  with  that.  Thank  you,  Senator,  and  thank  you, 
Commissioners.

Arkansas Partnership for Advanced Computing 

The University of Arkansas (UA), Fayetteville, the University of Arkansas at Lit-
tle  Rock  (UALR),  and  the  University  of  Arkansas  for  Medical  Sciences  (UAMS)  are 
partnering  with  state  industrial  affiliates  currently  including  representatives  from 
Acxiom  and  Accelerate  Arkansas,  and  state  government  representatives  currently 
including the Arkansas Science and Technology Authority and the Arkansas Depart-
ment of Information Systems, to leverage the Arkansas Research and Education Op-
tical  Network  (ARE–ON)  in  a  vision  and  plan  to  execute  that  vision  for  the  state 
of  Arkansas  in  high-performance  computing  for  research,  education,  and  business 
infrastructure. We believe that the availability of high-performance computing infra-
structure will be essential to the economic development of any state in the 21st cen-
tury. High-performance and advanced computing capabilities and technology for the 
understanding and solution of complex problems in science, engineering, and indus-
try  are  critical  to  scientific  leadership  and  economic  competitiveness  in  the  state  of 
Arkansas.  This  is  in  keeping  with  the  findings  of  the  report  from  the  President’s 
Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC) (http://www.nitrd.gov/pitac/ 
reports/20050609lcomputational/computational.pdf). 

The  debut  of  the  Arkansas  Research  and  Education  Optical  Network  (ARE–ON) 
is  a  clear  indicator  that  the  state  of  Arkansas  is  taking  a  fresh  and  energetic  ap-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:23 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75776.TXT JACKIE

proach to high performance computing for educational benefit and economic develop-
ment.  ARE–ON  came  online  to  the  University  of  Arkansas,  Fayetteville,  in  Decem-
ber 2006, and has already been instrumental in UAF participation in a collaborative 
course with Louisiana State University (LSU) this past spring. This is one example 
of  one  type  of  educational  activity  that  ARE–ON  will  support.  ARE–ON  represents 
a statewide initiative that already puts Arkansas ahead of some other states. 

Just  as  ARE–ON  is  a  statewide  effort  for  connectivity,  the  Arkansas  Partnership 
for  Advanced  Computing  recognizes  that  there  needs  to  be  a  complementary  state-
wide  effort  to  support  computational  infrastructure.  Three  additional  indicators 
show that the timing and support are right for such an effort: 

1.  This  growing  partnership  between  UA,  Fayetteville,  UALR,  and  UAMS  and 
several statewide industrial and government partners provide a solid foundation 
for a state vision for high performance computing. 
2.  Legislative  support  of  the  Arkansas  Science  and  Technology  Authority 
(ASTA) may provide funding potential that is an opportunity to gain seed fund-
ing for an initiative. 
3.  Funding  from  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  provided  for  the  pur-
chase  and  deployment  of  the  first  supercomputer  in  Arkansas,  Red  Diamond, 
on the UA, Fayetteville, campus, in February 2005. Additional funding from the 
National Science Foundation and EPSCoR in 2006 to UALR and from the NSF 
in  2007  to  UA,  Fayetteville,  is  enabling  the  significant  expansion  of  high-per-
formance  computing  infrastructure.  With  coordination  between  the  researchers 
on  both  campuses  it  will  be  possible  to  double  the  size  of  Red  Diamond  at  UA, 
Fayetteville,  and  to  establish  a  complementary  cluster  at  UALR.  ARE–ON  will 
provide  the  link  to  connect  the  supercomputing  facilities  as  a  nationally-com-
petitive  high-performance  computing  grid  that  is  accessible  to  researchers 
across the state. 

Fundamentally,  this  initiative  for  high-performance  and  advanced  computing  is 
about  quality,  quantity,  and  the  diversity  of  an  emerging  workforce.  The  workforce 
includes: 

• The current student body. 
• Importing  of  new  workers  who  are  attracted  to  our  state  because  of  technology 

opportunities and jobs, and 

• The reinvention of older workers who can be trained in new technologies. 
There are several statewide goals: 
• Increase the college graduation and retention rate. 
• Increase the high school graduation rate. 
• Attract new industry. 
• Enhance existing industry, and 
• Catalyze startup companies and invention 
To  achieve  these  goals  requires  a  statewide  commitment  to  modernization  and 
technology—a move to the 21st century. With these indicators and goals, a plan has 
been made that is economically sound that will move rapidly toward the goals, with 
modest  risk.  The  plan  will  reach  the  goals  with  minimum  cost,  with  the  maximum 
likelihood of success, and will mix external expertise with internal experts and lead-
ers in the state. This is a three-pronged attack: 

1. With support from UAF, UALR, ASTA, and the National Science Foundation, 
we  have  formulated  a  high  performance  computing  External  Advisory  Com-
mittee  (EAC)  to  look  at  the  requirements  and  needs  of  the  state.  This  external 
experience  base  will  make  recommendations,  and  provide  guidelines  and  mile-
stones. Dr. Thomas Sterling, Professor, LSU has provided some initial guidance 
on  our  current  status  and  has  recommended  that  this  is  the  fastest  way  to  get 
the  high-quality  insight  necessary  to  leap-frog  our  current  position.  Dr.  Dan 
Reed,  director  of  the  Renaissance  Computing  Institute  in  North  Carolina, 
Chancellor’s  Eminent  Professor  and  member  of  the  PITAC  committee,  has 
agreed to be the Chair of the EAC. 
The external advisory committee will visit Arkansas over a 3-day period in Oc-
tober.  They  will  conduct  a  series  of  brief  interviews  with  stakeholders  in  the 
state,  spending  a  day  each  in  Little  Rock  and  Fayetteville.  The  deliverable  of 
the  EAC  is  a  strategic  plan  that  describes  the  scope  and  a  roadmap  for  devel-
oping high performance computing infrastructure in the state of Arkansas.

2. We have implemented a standing Internal Review Committee composed of ex-
perts  within  the  state  of  Arkansas.  This  committee  consists  of  approximately 
two  dozen  participants  from  the  state  of  Arkansas,  and  an  additional  one,  two, 
or  three  external  participants.  The  Internal  Review  committee  will  refine  the 
statement  of  goals  that  the  External  committee  has  developed.  This  committee 
will be an interface to the academic community, K–12, and industry. 
3.  We  will  be  in  partnership  with  the  state  legislature,  the  Governor,  and  key 
leaders across the state to develop a sustainable funding model. 

Industrial partners from Acxiom and Accelerate Arkansas have been participating 
in  this  discussion  for  over  a  year.  One  thing  that  will  help  to  drive  this  effort  is 
the  identification  of  one  or  more  ‘‘Killer  Applications’’  (ones  that  grab  the  attention 
of  funding  agencies)  that  ARE–ON  and  the  computational  infrastructure  can  facili-
tate, and these may originate from industry, agriculture, or academics. For example, 
in  Louisiana,  ‘‘Killer  Applications’’  include:  (1)  modeling  of  storm  surge  to  avoid 
damage and save lives during hurricanes and other storms, (2) modeling of depleted 
oil wells and seismology studies that can help to avoid wild cat digging that wastes 
millions of dollars and harms the environment, (3) modeling of the preservation and 
ecological  changes  to  wetlands,  and  (4)  education  as  a  first-class  application,  to  im-
prove the competitiveness of Louisiana as a state. 

High  performance  computing  must  be  a  synergy  of  education,  industry,  and  re-
search  and  is  a  requirement  for  ensuring  that  all  Arkansans  can  fully  participate 
in the digital world. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. Ms. Bailey? 

STATEMENT OF CLAIRE BAILEY, DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF 

INFORMATION SYSTEMS, STATE OF ARKANSAS 

Ms. BAILEY. Good morning. I am Claire Bailey. I am your Direc-
tor  of  the  Department  of  Information  Systems  for  the  State  of  Ar-
kansas.  I  apologize  for  my  voice  this  morning.  I  lost  it  somewhere 
between my flight home from Minneapolis at a telecommunications 
conference  to  Little  Rock.  I  got  in  about  midnight,  but  I  am  very 
excited to be here today and to have the opportunity to address you 
and  my  colleagues.  I  wanted  to  open  by  describing  our  state  net-
work  in  place  today,  and  I’ve  provided  a  couple  of  graphical  rep-
resentations. 

The  State  of  Arkansas  Department  of  Information  Services  bro-
kers  and  manages  the  public  sector  network.  We  have  one  state 
network for state agency boards and commissions. We also provide 
our public school network, and we partner with our groups in high-
er  education  as  well.  The  second  map  represents  our  digital  radio 
system  that  we  are  very  happy  about  and  appreciate  the  support 
of  Senator  Pryor  and  the  FCC  and  other  state  partners.  The  Ar-
kansas Wireless Information Network is our public safety network. 
I  wanted  to  start  back  and  talk  a  little  bit  about  what  we  do  at 
the  department.  We  manage  a  wired  network  that  includes  over 
1,900 edge points and we work very closely with our public and pri-
vate sector partners. The integration of these networks also is how 
we  provide  our  Internet  access.  And  if  we  step  back  in  time,  in 
1994, just a few years ago, we were so excited. Our Internet capac-
ity for the state network was nine megs. There is an industry trend 
on networks that Internet capacity doubles about every 18 months. 
Today, we are slightly behind that average. We have doubled every 
19 months. And we stand at 990 MB capacity today. In just a little 
over  a  month  at  the  University  of  Arkansas  at  Pine  Bluff,  we  will 
take  our  network,  Internet  Point  of  Presence  to  over  one  gig.  And 
we are very excited about that.

Our statewide video network provides and supports distance edu-
cation,  e-learning.  We  have  over  520  systems  in  our  educational 
network.  And  we  average  over  19,000  conference  hours  a  month, 
which means that we provide that type of learning and opportunity 
for  92  subjects  with  over  500  courses.  That  snapshot  of  what  we 
have  today  in  many  ways  showcases  that  the  state  has  become 
what we define as the anchor tenant in our communities. As public 
services  that  we  deliver  continue  to  drive  our  network  capacity 
needs, as an anchor tenant, the funding provides or can provide an 
economic incentive for our private sector partners to be able to con-
tinually improve their infrastructure in support of the public sector 
needs. 

There  are  partnerships  with  private  sector.  Our  city,  our  coun-
ties, our state and Federal groups, we all share a common goal. Ev-
eryone in this room has a united vision to continue to advance the 
technology environment to be able to provide for our most precious 
people,  our  children,  and  we  thankfully  have  some  to  address  us 
today,  the  ability  to  access  the  best  and  newest  learning  tools  and 
the  current  technology  to  be  able  to  maximize  it.  Everyone  in  this 
room  also  has  the  ability  to  impact  societal  change  in  our  Arkan-
sas.  Whether  you  live  in  the  northwest  region  of  our  state  or  our 
Delta, your ability to have access to the services, the research, and 
the  jobs  of  tomorrow,  we  want  to  ensure  that  no  Arkansan  is  left 
behind. 

As  I  close,  I  wanted  to  leave  you  with  a  quote  from  our  Gov-
ernor’s  State  of  the  State  Address  from  this  past  January:  ‘‘When 
people look to Arkansas, they should see a leader in the Nation, in 
the world, and say: We want to do what they did in Arkansas.’’ And 
through  the  collaborative  efforts  of  everyone  in  this  room,  we  are 
champions  to  help  Arkansas  in  every  way  we  can.  Thank  you  for 
this  wonderful  opportunity  to  address  you  today,  and  I  look  for-
ward to any questions you may have. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. Bailey follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CLAIRE BAILEY, DIRECTOR, 

DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS, STATE OF ARKANSAS 

Thank  you  so  for  the  opportunity  to  address  you  at  this  U.S.  Senate  Commerce 

Committee field hearing. It is truly an honor to be a part of this event. 

I would like to open by describing our state network in place today. We have pro-
vided  a  hand-out  which  showcases  our  wired  and  wireless  sites  for  the  state  of  Ar-
kansas  Public  Sector  Network.  We  at  DIS  provide  management  and  systems  inte-
gration of these networks which includes 1,900 ‘edge’ devices of the Arkansas Public 
Sector Network. 

To  showcase  our  history  of  state  access,  our  state  Internet  capacity  in  1994  was 
nine  (9)  megabits  per  second.  The  industry  standard  for  doubling  Internet  capacity 
is  that  it  is  doubled  every  eighteen  (18)  months.  In  Arkansas  on  our  Public  Sector 
Network,  we  are  slightly  behind  this  standard.  We  double  every  nineteen  (19) 
months,  and  we  stand  at  990  megabits  per  second  soon  to  be  just  over  one  (1)  gig-
abit  per  second  of  capacity  with  our  latest  implementation  at  our  Internet  Point  of 
Presence  (POP)  at  our  shared  services  location  at  the  University  of  Arkansas  at 
Pine Bluff. 

Our  statewide  video  network  supports  approximately  520  systems  in  our  edu-
cation  environment  and  averages  over  19,000  conference  hours  a  month  with  over 
92 subjects and over 500 courses. 

That  is  a  snapshot  of  what  we  have  today.  In  many  ways  the  state  becomes  the 
‘anchor  tenant’  in  a  community.  The  demand  for  public  services  our  state  delivers 
continues  to  drive  network  capacity  needs.  As  an  anchor  tenant  for  communities, 
the funding the state provides impacts the economic incentives for our private sector

partners  to  be  able  to  continually  improve  their  infrastructure  in  support  of  our 
state’s needs. 

Through  our  partnerships  with  the  private  sector,  city,  county,  state  and  Federal 
groups,  we  all  share  a  common  goal—a  united  vision—to  continue  to  advance  the 
technology  environment  to  be  able  to  provide  our  most  precious  people—our  chil-
dren—the  ability  to  access  the  best  and  newest  learning  tools  and  the  technology 
to maximize it. 

Everyone in this room has the ability to impact true societal change in Arkansas. 
Whether  you  live  in  the  Northwest  region  of  our  state  or  our  Delta,  your  ability  to 
have access to public services—the research—the jobs of tomorrow—we want to en-
sure no Arkansan is left behind. 

As  I  close,  I  wanted  to  leave  you  with  a  quote  from  our  Governor’s  State  of  the 
State address from this past January: ‘‘When people look to Arkansas—they should 
see  a  leader  in  the  nation—in  the  world  and  say,  ‘We  want  to  do  what  they  did  in 
Arkansas.’ ’’ 

Through collaborative efforts of everyone in this room, we are championed to help 

Arkansas in every way we can. 

Thank  you  for  this  wonderful  opportunity  to  speak  this  morning  and  for  being 

here to hear our state’s vision for tomorrow. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Thank  you.  Now,  John,  before  I  introduce  you, 
I need to say that during the last legislative session, the Arkansas 
legislature enacted Act 602 legislation to create and operate a Con-
nect  Arkansas,  nonprofit  organization.  The  bill  was  sponsored  by 
Senator  John  Paul  Capps  of  Searcy.  The  bill  created  a  public/pri-
vate  partnership  aimed  at  increasing  the  broadband  coverage  for 
health,  industry,  education,  and  general  economic  development, 
and John Paul Capps is here today. Thank you for doing that, John 
Paul. Mr. Ahlen? 

STATEMENT OF JOHN W. AHLEN, PRESIDENT, 

ARKANSAS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AUTHORITY 

Mr.  AHLEN.  Thank  you,  Senator,  Commissioners.  My  name  is 
John Ahlen. I’m president of the Arkansas Science and Technology 
Authority, an instrumentality of the State of Arkansas that has the 
mission of bringing the benefits of science and advanced technology 
to  the  people  of  the  state  of  Arkansas.  We  know  a  lot  about  what 
the problems are. 

We know that in a world where markets are dynamic, global, and 
networked,  locations  without  affordable  broadband  are  discon-
nected  and  at  an  economic  disadvantage.  We  know  this  is  espe-
cially  true  in  an  information  age,  knowledge-based  economy.  Loca-
tions that do not have affordable knowledge-carrying infrastructure 
are both at a disadvantage informationally and again economically 
where  talent  and  innovations  are  the  driving  influences.  I  appre-
ciate your interest and leadership in addressing the issue of afford-
able  broadband  deployment  in  rural  places  and  would  suggest  the 
following, and you’re very much aware of these things. 

Use  a  robust  definition  of  broadband  to  accommodate  future  ap-
plications.  Develop  a  better  mapping  tool  to  measure  and  guide 
broadband  deployment  decisions.  We  know  what  worked  in  the 
past,  and  we  might  consider  broadband  deployment  incentives  for 
service  providers,  such  as  grants  and  investment  tax  credits,  uni-
versal  service  fund  models  that  we  used  for  telephone  deployment, 
the co-op model that was used for the deployment of electric power, 
and federal/state cost sharing, which is the model used in transpor-
tation infrastructure deployment.

And  lastly,  I  hope  you’ll  take  action  now.  The  future  of  rural 
communities depends on it. The state can do some things for itself, 
and  Connect  Arkansas,  which  my  two  colleagues  who  follow  will 
talk about, will be very helpful in providing broadband to business 
and industry to entrepreneurial businesses, and in enabling people 
at work, at home, and on the go to access all manner of digital re-
sources  wherever  and  whenever  they  need.  But  we  need  your  help 
to make that possible. Thank you. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Ahlen follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN W. AHLEN, PRESIDENT, 

ARKANSAS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AUTHORITY 

Good  morning  Senator  Pryor  and  Commissioners,  my  name  is  John  W.  Ahlen.  I 
am  president  of  the  Arkansas  Science  &  Technology  Authority,  an  instrumentality 
of  the  state  of  Arkansas  whose  mission  is  to  bring  the  benefits  of  science  and  ad-
vanced technology to the people and the state of Arkansas. 

We  know  that  in  a  world  where  markets  are  dynamic,  global,  and  networked,  lo-
cations  without  affordable  broadband  are  disconnected  and  at  an  economic  dis-
advantage. 

We know this is especially important in an information-age knowledge-based econ-
omy; locations that do not have affordable knowledge-carrying infrastructure are at 
both an informational disadvantage and an economic disadvantage where talent and 
innovations from research and development are driving influences. 

I  appreciate  your  interest  and  leadership  in  addressing  the  issue  of  affordable 

broadband deployment in rural places, and would suggest the following: 

• Use  a  robust  definition  of  broadband  to  accommodate  future  applications  and 
• Develop a better mapping tool to measure and guide broadband deployment de-

cisions. 

We know what has worked in the past. Consider broadband deployment incentives 

service providers such as: 

• grants and investment tax credits, 
• the universal service fund model that was used for telephone deployment, 
• the co-op model that was used for electric power deployment, and 
• the  Federal-state  cost  sharing  model  that  is  used  in  transportation  infrastruc-

ture deployment.

Lastly, I hope you’ll take action now, the future of rural communities depends on 
it. The state can do some things for itself—like Connect Arkansas—but we also need 
your help.

Affordable  broadband  access  is  an  economic  development  issue,  which  can  be  ad-
dressed  along  four  dimensions:  broadband  deployment,  technology,  the  urban-rural 
split, and time. 

Broadband Deployment. What is it? It is information-carrying capacity (measured 
in  bits  per  second),  and  the  demand  for  capacity  by  applications  keeps  going  up. 
Definitions  of  broadband  include  256  kilobits  per  second  (OECD)  and  384  kilobits 
per second (Connect Arkansas), with experimental capacity in research domains ex-
ceeding  gigabits  per  second.  Other  countries  and  some  states  are  concluding  that 
broadband  capacity  delivered  by  fiber  to  the  home  should  be  the  minimum.  Rec-
ommendation: use a robust definition of broadband. 

Where  is  it?  Broadband  availability  is  typically  shown  by  postal  zip  codes,  which 
is  not  a  very  informative  way  to  discriminate  between  locations  that  do  or  do  not 
have  access.  The  EAST  students  today  will  show  a  much  more  useful  way  to  map 
broadband  availability  and  inform  deployment  decisions.  Recommendation:  develop 
a better mapping tool to measure and guide broadband deployment. 

Technologies.  Broadband  technologies  vary  and  their  deployment  is  influenced  by 
competing business models and regulatory structures. As more content is digitized— 
and  digitization  is  the  key  technology  driver  in  the  new  economy—any  of  the  com-
peting  technologies  can  provide  content  previously  considered  the  proprietary  do-
main  of  other  competitors,  leading  to  a  kind  of  regulatory  convolution,  if  not  grid-
lock.  The  market  success  of  all  of  the  business  models  is  measured  in  terms  of  the 
return on the deployment investment, which is much more favorable in areas where 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:23 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75776.TXT JACKIE

38 

the  customers  are  densely  packed.  If  equal  broadband  access  is  the  American  goal, 
then market forces have failed to deliver, just look at broadband deployment in the 
Mississippi  River  Delta.  Recommendations:  consider  incentives  for  service  providers 
that  address  areas  without  affordable  broadband;  base  incentives  on  independently 
compiled deployment data; and use more refined mapping tools. 

Urban-rural.  The  least  favorable  locations  for  broadband  deployment  are  rural, 
where  customers  are  few  and  separated  by  long  distances  and  where  deployment 
cannot be justified by the return on investment. With markets dynamic, global, and 
networked,  locations  without  affordable  broadband  are  disconnected  and  at  an  eco-
nomic  disadvantage.  State  government  provides  broadband  for  education,  health 
care,  and  other  government  services—often  supported  by  Federal  grants—but 
broadband deployment is about economic growth, so it is about business and indus-
try;  entrepreneurship  services;  and  enabling  people  at  work,  at  home,  and  on  the 
go  to  access  all  manner  of  digital  resources  wherever  and  whenever  they  need.  If 
we were talking today about electric power instead of broadband, we would be say-
ing  that  students  can  have  lights  at  school,  but  have  to  read  in  the  dark  at  home. 
Recommendation:  consider  broadband  deployment  incentives  such  as  grants  and  in-
vestment  tax  credits,  the  universal  service  fund  model  for  telephone  deployment,  the 
cooperative  model  for  electricity  deployment—including  Federal  subsidy,  and  the 
Federal-state cost sharing model used in transportation infrastructure deployment. 

Time.  The  clock  is  ticking  for  rural  Arkansas  and  rural  America.  According  to  a 
report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United 
States  has  the  largest  number  of  total  broadband  subscribers  in  the  OECD,  but  on 
the  basis  of  broadband  subscribers  per  100  inhabitants,  the  U.S.  ranks  15th  in  the 
OECD  at  19.6.  A  report  today  indicates  that  China  will  have  ‘‘the  world’s  largest 
Internet  population  in  just  2  years.’’  Recommendation:  Take  action  now,  the  future 
of rural communities depends on it. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you very much. 
Mr. WINNINGHAM. Senator, if we possibly could, could we let Mr. 

Walls go first? 

Senator PRYOR. Sure. That’d be great. That’d be great. 
Mr. WINNINGHAM. That’d be great. That’d be great. 
STATEMENT OF C. SAM WALLS, CEO, 
ARKANSAS CAPITAL CORPORATION 

Mr.  WALLS.  Thank  you,  Senator.  I’m  Sam  Walls,  and  I’m  the 
Chief Executive Officer of the Arkansas Capital Corporation. We’re 
a  50-year-old  private,  nonprofit  business  development  corporation 
that was named in the Connect Arkansas legislation to be the enti-
ty to form the Connect Arkansas nonprofit organization. To my left 
is  James  Winningham.  He  is  the  Chairman  of  the  Arkansas 
Broadband  Initiative.  And  collectively  with  Dr.  Ahlen,  we’re  here 
representing Connect Arkansas. 

Connect Arkansas is a private and public sector collaborative ef-
fort  to  bring  broadband  Internet  access  to  all  Arkansans.  We’re 
going  to  focus  on  three  key  activities.  The  first  activity  will  be  to 
accurately map where connectivity truly exists in Arkansas and at 
what speeds. This will require working with numerous entities, pri-
marily  the  service  providers  that  operate  here  in  Arkansas.  Be-
cause  Connect  Arkansas  is  designed  to  encourage  collaboration,  it 
will work with providers on getting the relevant information to ac-
complish  this  task.  The  second  activity  of  the  effort  will  be  to  sur-
vey  communities  throughout  the  state  to  better  determine  either 
why  they  choose  to  use  broadband  or  conversely,  why  they  have 
chosen  not  to.  And  this  complements  the  third  activity  of  the  ef-
fort—working  with  leadership  in  every  county  of  Arkansas  to  de-
velop a strategy to educate the populace on the value and need for 
broadband  in  their  personal  and  professional  lives.  This  preparing 
of  people  and  organizations  to  take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of

39 

broadband  is  perhaps  the  most  important  part  of  our  effort.  With-
out  preparation,  broadband  is  in  danger  of  being  a  very  powerful 
economic  and  social  tool,  but  without  people  and  businesses  with 
the  necessary  skills  and  insight  to  take  advantage  of  it  and  ulti-
mately  without  enough  demand  to  sustain  it.  Connect  Arkansas  is 
a delivery platform-neutral entity. 

And  by  that  I  mean  that  it  will  not  seek  to  advocate  for  one 
broadband  Internet  delivery  system  over  another.  Its  only  focus  is 
to  drive  market  demand  in  the  belief  that  once  a  market  can  be 
demonstrated, the private sector will step in to meet that demand. 
Connect Arkansas’ success will in large part be driven by the abil-
ity  of  the  private  and  public  sector  to  work  together  to  accomplish 
this vital task. There is no question in my mind, however, that cre-
ating  statewide  broadband  connectivity  is  the  single  most  impor-
tant activity that we can be involved in. At the Federal level, there 
is a need for our leaders to elevate this issue as a top priority. 

Unfortunate recent events in Minnesota have drawn the Nation’s 
attention  once  again  to  the  deteriorating  infrastructure  of  the 
United States and for good cause. The inadequacy of our technology 
infrastructure,  however,  should  be  of  equal  concern.  Just  as  the 
Federal  Government  provided  incentives  and  capital  to  pave  and 
light rural America in the last century, ultimately it will most like-
ly take delivery mechanism-neutral incentives to extend broadband 
Internet access to those same areas. 

To conclude, it is time for everyone to publicly acknowledge that 
high-speed  broadband  Internet  access  is  not  a  luxury  but  a  basic 
necessity.  As  a  nation,  lack  of  broadband  puts  us  at  an  unaccept-
able  competitive  disadvantage.  The  United  States  relies  a  great 
deal  on  the  innovation  and  creativity  of  its  populace  to  maintain 
our dominant strategic and economic position in the global commu-
nity.  We  jeopardize  that  position  by  allowing  other  countries  to 
move further and further ahead of us in the availability and usage 
of  broadband.  At  the  state  level,  rural  states  like  Arkansas  will 
never  be  able  to  effectively  develop  and  improve  without  access  to 
this indispensable utility. For many, the education, health, and so-
cial  benefits  that  can  be  derived  from  broadband  access  is  their 
only  chance  to  better  their  lives  and  the  lives  of  their  children. 
Thank you.

why they have chosen not to. This compliments the third activity of the effort, work-
ing  with  leadership  in  every  county  of  Arkansas  to  develop  a  strategy  to  educate

Connect  Arkansas  is  a  ‘‘delivery  platform  neutral’’  entity.  By  that  I  mean  that  it 
will  not  seek  to  advocate  for  one  broadband  Internet  delivery  system  over  another. 
Its  only  focus  is  to  drive  market  demand  in  the  belief  that  once  a  market  can  be 
demonstrated,  the  private  sector  will  step  in  to  meet  that  demand.  Connect  Arkan-
sas’s success will in large part be driven by the ability of the private and public sec-
tor to work together to accomplish this vital task. 

Arkansas  Capital  Corporation  has  been  involved  in  economic  development  in  Ar-
kansas for 50 years, the last 18 of which I have been with the organization. Today, 
we are involved in a number of activities related to improving the economic environ-
ment  of  Arkansas  including  Access  to  Capital,  Business  Development,  and  Edu-
cation.  There  is  no  question  in  my  mind,  however,  that  creating  statewide 
broadband connectivity is the single most important activity that I and my organiza-
tion have been involved with. 

After  World  War  II,  Federal  and  state  leaders  realized  that  for  rural  states  like 
Arkansas  to  prosper,  they  must  have  good  roads  and  access  to  reliable  and  afford-
able electricity. Later, phone lines were considered a requirement. For this century, 
broadband Internet access is the absolute necessity without which these people, who 
are  already  more  often  than  not  at  a  disadvantage,  are  left  further  and  further  be-
hind. It is literally this era’s ‘‘interstate highway system’’. Look at the various obsta-
cles that many rural states face, inadequate healthcare, below standard educational 
opportunities,  and  lack  of  business  development.  As  the  states  try  to  address  these 
issues the solutions invariably involve broadband Internet access. 

At the Federal level, there is a need for our leaders to elevate this issue as a top 
priority. Unfortunate recent events in Minnesota have drawn the Nation’s attention 
once  again  to  the  deteriorating  ‘‘infrastructure’’  of  the  United  States  and  for  good 
cause. The inadequacy of our technology infrastructure, however, should be of equal 
concern.  Just  as  the  Federal  Government  provided  incentives  and  capital  to  pave 
and  light  rural  America  in  the  last  century,  ultimately  it  will  most  likely  take  ‘‘de-
livery  mechanism  neutral’’  incentives  to  ultimately  extend  broadband  Internet  ac-
cess to those same areas. 

To  conclude,  it  is  time  for  everyone  to  publicly  acknowledge  that  high-speed 
broadband  Internet  access  is  not  a  luxury  but  a  basic  necessity.  As  a  nation,  lack 
of  broadband  puts  us  at  an  unacceptable  competitive  disadvantage.  The  United 
States  relies  a  great  deal  on  the  innovation  and  creativity  of  its  populace  to  main-
tain  our  dominant  strategic  and  economic  position  in  the  global  community.  We 
jeopardize  that  position  by  allowing  other  countries  to  move  further  and  further 
ahead  of  us  in  the  availability  and  usage  of  broadband.  At  the  state  level,  rural 
states  like  Arkansas  will  never  be  able  to  effectively  develop  and  improve  without 
access to this indispensable utility. For many, the education, health and social bene-
fits  that  can  be  derived  from  broadband  access  is  their  only  chance  to  better  their 
lives and the lives of their children. 

Thank you for your time.

board won’t suffice. Our kids deserve broadband infrastructure that

is 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  WINNINGHAM.  Broadband  is  the  power  for  a  U.S.  Senator  in 
Washington to coordinate a meeting in his home state in a fraction 
of  the  time  it  would  take  with  dial-up  data  service.  Broadband  is 
the  power  for  a  student  to  find  a  thousand  related  articles  for  a 
homework  assignment  in  a  fraction  of  the  time  it  would  take  to 
find even one article in the school library, unless that school library 
has  broadband.  A  student  with  broadband  at  home  has  several 
hours  of  broadband  to  research  in  any  given  day,  whereas  a  stu-
dent that only has library broadband may have one hour if it’s the 
right  day  of  the  week  and  if  that  student  can  get  one  of  the  com-
puters. 

Broadband  is  the  power  for  that  student’s  mom  to  find  that  stu-
dent two pairs of jeans she can afford instead of one pair she can’t 
afford.  And  she  can  find  those  two  pairs  in  a  fraction  of  the  time 
it  takes  to  find  that  one.  Broadband  is  the  power  for  that  single 
mom  who  can’t  leave  her  child  to  take  night  classes.  Broadband  is 
the power for that school to offer night classes, midnight classes to 
a thousand such moms across the country instead of offering 7 p.m. 
to  9  p.m.  classes  to  five  or  six  moms  who  live  within  20  miles. 
Broadband  could  be  the  power  of  that  child  to  stay  here  in  Arkan-
sas with his broader family instead of having to be exported some-
where  else  where  there  are  jobs  that  are  commensurate  with  their 
abilities.  Broadband  is  the  power  for  a  small  business  in  rural  Ar-
kansas  to  offer  its  products  to  people  all  across  the  United  States 
and  across  the  oceans  instead  of  offering  them  to  only  the  1,500 
residents  in  their  town.  I  suggest  to  you  that  Governor  Beebe’s 
words  are  not  only  true  for  Arkansas,  but  they’re  also  true  for 
every child in the United States. 

And  that  true  technology  equity  is  not  had,  as  long  as  there  is 
another  nation  with  better  broadband  than  the  United  States— 
that’s why Connect Arkansas is so important to Arkansas, because 
we  have  moms,  we  have  children,  we  have  small  businesses.  We 
need  a  Federal  economic  environment  that  is  broadband-friendly, 
because  we  need  technology  equity  for  our  children,  for  our  state, 
and for our Nation. Thank you for your time and attention. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Winningham follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JAMES WINNINGHAM, ORGANIZING CHAIR, 

ARKANSAS BROADBAND INITIATIVE (ABI) 

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, good morning. 
My  name  is  James  Winningham.  I  am  the  Organizing  Chair  of  the  Arkansas 
Broadband Initiative (ABI). ABI is the group which worked with Senator John Paul 
Capps to draft this year’s Connect Arkansas Act. 

Why is Connect Arkansas so important to our state? This year in his State of the 
State  address,  Governor  Beebe  said  that  ‘‘in  today’s  world,  just  learning  to  type  on

the keyboard won’t suffice. Our kids deserve broadband infrastructure that connects 
them to the Internet and provides technology equity.’’ 

You  see,  it  has  never  been  about  the  keyboard.  That’s  just  part  of  the  computer, 
and the computer age has never been about the computer. It has always been about 
the data. 

Data  is  information,  and  information  is  power,  and  broadband  is  information  on 
steroids.  Broadband  is  the  power  for  a  U.S.  Senator  in  Washington  to  coordinate  a 
meeting  back  in  his  home  state  in  a  fraction  of  the  time  it  would  take  with  dial- 
up data service. 

Broadband  is  the  power  for  a  student  to  find  a  thousand  related  articles  for  a 
homework assignment in a fraction of the time it would take to find even one article 
in the school library . . . unless that school library has broadband. 

A student with broadband at home has several hours of broadband research time 
in  a  day,  whereas  a  student  that  only  has  library  broadband  may  have  1  hour,  if 
it is the right day of the week. 

Broadband  is  the  power  for  that  student’s  mom  to  find  that  student  two  pairs  of 
jeans  she  can  afford,  instead  of  one  pair  she  can’t  afford,  and  in  a  fraction  of  the 
time it takes to find the one. 

Broadband  is  the  power  for  that  single  mom  who  can’t  leave  her  child  to  take 

night classes. 

Broadband is the power for that school to offer night classes . . . midnight classes 
. . .  to  a  thousand  such  moms  across  the  country,  instead  of  offering  7  p.m.  to  9 
p.m. classes to five or six moms who live within 20 miles. 

Broadband  is  the  power  for  a  small  business  in  rural  Arkansas  to  offer  its  prod-
ucts to people all across the United States and across the oceans instead of offering 
them only to the 1,500 residents of their town. 

I suggest to you that Governor Beebe’s words are not only true for Arkansas, but 
also  true  for  every  child  in  the  United  States,  and  that  true  technology  equity  is 
not  had  as  long  as  there  is  another  nation  with  better  broadband  than  the  United 
States. 

That’s  why  Connect  Arkansas  is  so  important  to  Arkansas,  because  we  have 
moms,  and  children,  and  small  businesses.  We  need  a  Federal  economic  environ-
ment  that  is  broadband-friendly,  because  we  need  technology  equity  for  our  chil-
dren, for our state, and for our Nation. 

Thank you for your time and attention.

Commissioner COPPS. Can I ask a quick question? 
Mr. WINNINGHAM. Yes, please do. 
Commissioner COPPS. Have you advanced to the point with Con-
nect Arkansas that you have some time frames in mind for getting 
the  mapping  data  and  just  who  has  what,  at  what  speed,  and  all? 
Mr.  WINNINGHAM.  Commissioner,  we  really  have  done  our  plan-
ning,  essentially  based  on—well, 
things. 
ConnectKentucky  is  one  model  that  we’ve  looked  at.  And  another 
model  is  one  that  has  been  used  in  California  and  a  couple  of 
places,  but  this  is  a  very  new  effort.  We  do  have  a  draft  plan  in 
place, but we really haven’t finalized plans at this point. 

Mr.  WALLS.  That’s  correct.  We  have,  as  James  said,  a  prelimi-
nary business plan that’s been completed and which the governor’s 
advisory  board  has  been  appointed.  And  we  are  in  the  process  of 
electing  our  board  of  directors  for  the  effort.  The  mapping  would 
be the first step that follows this. 

Commissioner  COPPS.  I  would  just  like  to  stress  the  importance. 
You  will  be  collecting  data,  I  guess,  from  a  lot  of  providers.  Some-
times that’s a challenge to do that, but I get the impression in this 
state that folks are used to working together. And I hope that that 
will  happen  here,  because  it  really  is  vital  that  you  get  a  better 
handle  on  deployment  than  we’ve  been  able  to  get  so  far  at  the 
FCC. 

Mr. WALLS. Commissioner, that’s written into Act 604. That’s one 
of the provisions for Connect Arkansas is to set forth a process for

STATEMENT OF MATT DOZIER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

THE EAST INITIATIVE, INC. 

Mr.  DOZIER.  Thank  you  so  much,  Senator,  Commissioners.  Good 
morning, and we are so excited about the opportunity to speak with 
you  today.  My  name  is  Matt  Dozier,  and  I  head  an  educational 
nonprofit  group  that  delivers  training  and  support  on  an  edu-
cational  program  that  has  been  named  a  national  model  by  the 
Federal  departments  of  Education  and  Labor.  This  program  is 
called EAST, and it was started here in Arkansas in 1996 and has 
since  grown  to  schools  across  the  country.  In  a  nutshell,  EAST  is 
an  educational  program  that  addresses  21st  century  educational 
needs  by  combining  local  service  projects  and  high-end  technology 
with  a  student-centered  approach  that  allows  our  students  to  take 
responsibility  for  their  own  learning  and  their  projects  in  a  very 
real world fashion. 

Last  year,  we  were  approached  by  the  Arkansas  Science  and 
Technology  Authority  (ASTA)  about  using  EAST  students  to  de-
velop and deploy a project looking at broadband access in rural Ar-
kansas.  With  funding  from  ASTA  and  the  Winthrop  Rockefeller 
Foundation, we recruited student teams from ten schools in two of 
the southern regions of our state to participate in this project. And 
I  am  pleased  to  have  representatives  from  this  regional  working 
group  here  today.  They  are  eager  to  explain  the  things  that  they 
have  done,  and  how  they  have  made  a  difference  in  their  commu-
nities. Andrew—Michelle.

Good morning and thank you for the opportunity to speak today. My name is Matt 
Dozier  and  I  head  an  educational  non-profit  group  that  delivers  training  and  sup-
port on an educational program that has been named a national model by the Fed-

things  that  they  have  done  and  how  they  have  made  a  difference  in  their  commu-

Andrew Mays 

Hello! My name is Andrew Mays of Mineral Springs High School, where I am cur-
rently  a  sophomore  in  my  6th  semester  of  EAST  which  stands  for  Environmental 
and Spatial Technology. 

This  past  year,  as  one  of  my  EAST  projects,  I  represented  the  Mineral  Springs 
School  District,  in  collaboration  with  students  from  9  other  schools  in  6  different 
counties,  to  gather  information  about  the  usage  of  Broadband  throughout  the  state 
of Arkansas. In the beginning phase of the project, we decided to change the phras-
ing in order make the survey more comprehensible to the general public. Broadband 
was  such  a  new  and  foreign  concept,  that  many  households  in  our  area  were  unfa-
miliar with the terminology originally used in the surveys. After we finished rewrit-
ing  the  surveys,  we  distributed  them  to  students  and  businesses  in  our  designated 
areas, eventually gathering 2,500 usable surveys from the counties of Howard, Little 
River,  Ashley,  Bradley,  Drew  and  Lincoln.  The  survey’s  questions  ranged  from  as 
simple  as,  ‘‘Do  you  own  a  computer?’’  to  as  difficult  as,  ‘‘Is  DSL  available  in  your 
area?’’  Upon  receiving  the  returned  information,  we  began  diligently  downloading 
the results into our own schools databases. Then students from each of the counties 
met  in  Monticello  and  compiled  their  area’s  information,  along  with  ours,  into  one 
database. While in Monticello, we were assisted by professors of both the University 
of  Arkansas  at  Monticello  and  the  University  of  Hope.  With  their  help  we  created 
a map using ESRI mapping software. This map is currently on display before many 
today.  In  working  on  this  project,  we  the  EAST  students  of  South  Arkansas  have 
realized the need for the expansion of broadband availability to all of our state’s citi-
zens,  not  only  for  educational  purposes,  but  also  for  economic  growth,  and  the  ad-
vancement  of  our  state  into  technology  of  the  21st  century.  I  thank  you  for  your 
time. 
Michelle Neal 

Hi, my name is Michelle Neal and I am a junior at Saratoga High School. I start-
ed  working  on  the  Rural  Broadband  Project  with  the  EAST  Initiative  organization 
in  the  2006  school  year.  We  went  and  handed  out  surveys  to  our  local  businesses 
and  people  in  our  community.  Basically  we  wanted  to  get  a  picture  of  who  had 
broadband  and  who  wanted  it  but  couldn’t  get  it.  Broadband  is  important  simply 
because  of  the  fact  of  education.  Future  college  students  could  go  online  and  take 
classes if they had access to the Internet. E-mail is also an important source of com-
munication in today’s society. Broadband would be beneficial to parents also because 
most parents don’t realize that you can go online and check their child’s grades, test 
scores,  and  progress  of  what  they’re  doing  in  school;  and  most  parents  don’t  know 
this  because  they  can  not  get  Internet  in  their  area.  Our  research  shows  that  most 
people  don’t  even  have  a  computer  and  we  believe  this  could  be  because  of  the 
broadband issue.

gust  2006  and  have  been  on  the  EAST  Broadband  Project  since  January  2007.  It’s 
a  huge  priority  to  us  and  our  class  plans  to  see  the  finish  of  this  project.  When  I 
was  asked  to  come  here  Ms.  Glaze  said  that  you  were  looking  for  personal  testi-
mony. 

Every  morning  when  I  get  ready  I  use  hairspray!  Well  how  much  does  one  use? 
I would have to start getting ready 2 hours earlier if I wanted to get on the Internet 
and  check  the  weather  since  I  have  dial-up.  Dial-up  Internet  is  so  incredibly  slow 
and I would mimic the noise, but it’s extremely embarrassing. 

Right now Arkansas is in a box, we have our limits. It is time for rural Arkansas 
to  get  out  of  that  box.  Broadband  is  not  a  convenience,  but  a  source  of  technology 
that will move us forward with the rest of the world. 

I’m also a senior in high school and I take several classes that are concurrent with 
college.  It’s  almost  impossible  to  check  online  grades  and  rankings  at  home.  Even 
at school, where time is limited, the Internet isn’t much faster. 

Thank you for letting us come and speak to you today. 

Trisha Tart 

I  am  Trisha  Tart  a  freshman  at  the  University  of  Arkansas.  I  graduated  from 
Ashdown High School in May of 2007 where I had been working on this project for 
almost  2  years.  I  am  proud  to  be  one  of  the  founding  members  of  Ashdown  EAST’s 
Rural  Broadband  team.  It  is  so  hard  to  describe  to  outsiders  dial-up  in  the  rural 
community.  It  was  really  only  after  I  had  arrived  at  college  and  experienced  the 
campus  high-speed  network  that  I  myself  completely  understood  what  I  had  been 
missing and how hard it was to access information back home. 

In this project, we conducted surveys and had a lot of fun helping to educate peo-
ple about having broadband. Often, they don’t know what broadband really is or the 
effects  it  can  have  on  them.  What  I  think  is  really  important  for  you  to  know,  is 
that everyone here realizes that people in rural Arkansas need this. It is really im-
portant.  What  we  need  to  do  is  make  it  available  in  the  rural  areas  because  that 
is  the  only  way  we  are  going  to  advance.  These  kids  are  going  to  college  and  all 
the scholarships and applications online are impossible unless you do them at school 
. . .  and  our  school  Internet  isn’t  even  that  fast  and  it’s  difficult  to  get  on  a  com-
puter but, it is really important that everyone here understand that this would have 
such a positive effect on everyone’s education. The people of Arkansas, they’re going 
to love it . . . it’s great. If high school students are this excited—we worked so hard 
surveying—everyone  is  going  to  see  that.  Once  the  adults  realize  what  broadband 
can  offer  their  communities,  and  how  it  is  going  to  affect  everyone  then  they  will 
absolutely want it. It’s great and we love it. 
Matt Dozier 

As  you  can  see,  there  is  a  great  deal  of  capacity  in  our  local  communities  and 
within  our  youngest  citizens  to  engage  in  real  work  that  can  address  local  needs. 
What we believe we have demonstrated through this project is that a ‘‘local engage-
ment’’ strategy is the best way to not only educate people on larger issues, but also 
to  allow  them  to  be  part  of  the  solution  rather  than  outsiders  looking  in,  waiting 
for  someone  else  to  solve  their  problems.  Students  like  these  are  typical  of  EAST 
students, and indeed all students. They are creative, intuitive, adaptable, and ready 
to serve in their communities. We all benefit when we don’t stand in their way, but 
rather  stand  behind  them  and  provide  them  with  the  tools  they  need  to  take  on 
challenges. 

Just as we brought electricity and telephone service to all of Arkansas in an effort 
to  keep  pace  with  the  needs  of  the  modern  world,  we  can  bring  broadband  access 
to every community to allow it to become a larger part of the wider world. This issue 
strikes  at  the  core  of  communities  of  students  like  these.  This  is  truly  an  area 
where,  if  we  fail  to  act,  we  will  leave  a  generation  behind.  The  EAST  Initiative  is 
dedicated to helping our students find within themselves the abilities that will serve 
them  and  us  well  through  their  adult  careers.  They  need  your  help  as  well.  Thank 
you. 

STATEMENT OF MICHELLE NEAL, STUDENT, 

SARATOGA HIGH SCHOOL 

Ms. NEAL. Hello, everyone. My name is Michelle Neal, and I am 
a  junior  at  Saratoga  High  School.  I  started  working  on  the  rural 
broadband  project  with  The  EAST  Initiative  organization  in  the 
2006  school  year.  What  we  did  was  we  went  out  and  handed  out

surveys to local businesses and people in our community to see who 
had  broadband  or  who  wanted  broadband,  but  couldn’t  get 
broadband  because  they  lived  in  such  rural  areas.  I  think  this 
would be beneficial to everyone for the simple fact of education, be-
cause  people  who  want  to  go  to  college—future  college  students 
could go online and take classes if they had access to the Internet. 
Also,  another  important  aspect  is  e-mail.  E-mail  is  a  really  good 
source of communication in today’s society. 

And  parents  would  benefit  from  this  also,  because  most  parents 
don’t  know  that  you  can  go  online  and  look  at  your  child’s  test 
scores and grades and progress in school. Most parents don’t know 
this, because they can’t get Internet in the rural areas. 

Also, our research shows that most people don’t even have a com-
puter,  and  we  think  that  this  could  be  because  of  the  DSL  issue. 
And  all  of  us  that  are  in  EAST,  most  of  our  projects  are—almost 
all  of  them  have  to  have  work  on  the  Internet.  And  since  we  live 
in  such  rural  areas,  we  can’t  get  Internet.  We  have  to  wait  until 
we  get  to  school  to  do  homework,  and  we  think  that  this  would  be 
beneficial in our work. 

STATEMENT OF ANDREW MAYS, STUDENT, 

MINERAL SPRINGS HIGH SCHOOL 

Mr.  MAYS.  Like  was  said  earlier,  I  am  Andrew  Mays,  from  Min-
eral  Springs  High  School,  and  I  am  a  sophomore  working  in  my 
sixth  semester  of  EAST.  And  this  past  year,  as  one  of  my  EAST 
projects,  I  actually  represented  Mineral  Springs  School  District  in 
collaboration with students from nine other schools in six different 
counties,  around  the  equivalent  of  19  students,  in  order  to  gather 
information  about  the  usage  of  broadband  throughout  the  state  of 
Arkansas.  In  the  beginning  phase  of  the  project,  we  actually  de-
cided to change the wording in order to make the survey more com-
prehensible to the people. 

Since  broadband  was  such  a  new  and  foreign  concept,  many 
households in our area were unfamiliar with the terminology origi-
nally  used  in  our  surveys.  So  after  we  finished  rewriting  the  sur-
veys,  we  distributed  them  to  the  students  and  businesses  in  our 
designated  areas,  eventually  gathering  2,500  usable  surveys  from 
the  counties  of  Howard,  Little  River,  Ashley,  Bradley,  Drew,  and 
Lincoln.  The  survey’s  questions  ranged  from  as  simple  as:  Do  you 
own a computer? To as difficult as: Is DSL available in your area? 
Upon  receiving  the  returned  information,  we  began  diligently 
downloading the results into our own schools’ databases. 

The  students  from  each  of  the  counties  then  met  in  Monticello 
and  compiled  their  area’s  information  along  with  ours  into  one 
large database. While in Monticello, we were assisted by professors 
of both the University of Arkansas at Monticello and the University 
of  Hope.  With  their  help,  we  created  a  map  using  ESRI  mapping 
software.  This  map  is  currently  on  display  before  many  today.  In 
working on this project, we, the EAST students of South Arkansas, 
have  realized  the  need  for  the  expansion  of  broadband  availability 
to  all  of  our  state’s  citizens,  not  only  for  educational  purposes,  but 
also for economic growth and the advancement of our state into the 
technology of the 21st century. Thank you for your time.

STATEMENT OF LILA SIVLEY, STUDENT, 

ASHDOWN HIGH SCHOOL 

Ms.  SIVLEY.  Hey  everyone,  I’m  Lila  Sivley.  I’m  from  Ashdown.  I 
help  out  in  the  EAST  lab.  EAST  is  Environmental  and  Spatial 
Technology.  We  help  a  lot  in  our  communities,  and  broadband  is 
our  main  priority,  in  ours  I  know  it  is.  I’ve  been  with  this  project 
since January this year, and we’ve been working really hard. We’ve 
got  the  marketing  plan  and  it  was  after  ConnectKentucky,  and 
we’re  trying  to  get  it  to  be  Connect  Arkansas,  as  everyone  must 
know.  One  of  the  big  deals  that  Mr.  Pryor  needs  to  know  is  how’s 
it  going  to  help  us.  Well,  me,  I  wake  up  every  morning.  I  put  hair 
spray  in  my  hair.  How  much,  you  may  think.  Well,  you  get  on  the 
Internet,  and  if  I  don’t  get  up  two  hours  early,  then  I  have  no 
chance of getting on the computer. Do you realize how long it takes 
for  dial-up?  I  would  mimic  the  noise,  but  it’s  embarrassing.  It’s  so 
slow.  And  if  I  wanted  to  do  homework,  absolutely  impossible.  Un-
less  it’s  calculator  and  pencil,  no  help.  I  do  essays  and  I’m  a  sen-
ior—if  I  didn’t  say  that.  I  don’t  know  if  I  did.  But  I  am  going  to 
go  to  college,  and  a  lot  of  classes  that  I  take  this  year  as  a  senior 
are  concurrent  with  college  credits.  So  if  I  was  to  want  to  get  on- 
line, I’d have to do it at school. It’s simply impossible to do it where 
I live. And I’m only about ten minutes out of town. But I just want 
everybody to realize, it’s a must-have. It’s time for Arkansas to not 
be  limited.  We’re  in  a  box.  We  need  to  step  out  of  that  and  really 
get out there. Get out in the world. But I’m going to let Trish talk 
now. Thanks. 

STATEMENT OF TRISHA TART, GRADUATE, 

ASHDOWN HIGH SCHOOL 

Ms. TART. Hi, I am Trish Tart. I’m a freshman at the University 
of  Arkansas.  I  graduated  from  Ashdown  last  year,  and  I’ve  been 
working  on  this  for  almost  two  years  now.  I  was  one  of  the  found-
ing  members.  And  it’s  so  hard  to  describe  dial-up  in  a  rural  area 
until  you  go  somewhere  else  and  you  have  broadband.  I’m  in  col-
lege now and I have it, and I just realized how difficult it was. You 
know,  we  did  do  the  surveys.  We  had  a  lot  of  fun  with  that,  going 
through  and  seeing  the  ignorance  that  a  lot  of  people  have  about 
having broadband. They don’t know what it is, and they don’t know 
what, you know, the effects it can have on them. But I think what’s 
really important is that everybody here realizes people in rural Ar-
kansas need this. You know, it’s really important. 

All we need to do is get it out and get it to those people, because 
that’s the only way anybody’s going to advance. Now these kids are 
going to college, and all the scholarships and applications you have 
to do are online. It’s impossible unless you do it at school. And our 
school  Internet’s  really  not  even  that  fast.  It’s  difficult  to  get  on  a 
computer.  But  it’s  really  important  that  everybody  here  realizes 
that  it’s  going  to  have  such  a  positive  effect  on  everybody’s  edu-
cation.  And  the  people  in  Arkansas,  they’re  going  to  love  it.  It’s 
great. 

So  if  high  school  students  are  this  excited—we  worked  so  hard 
surveying  everybody,  I  think  people  are  going  to  see  that.  And  if 
students are this excited, once the adults realize what it is and how

it’s  going  to  help  everybody,  everybody  is  going  to  want  it.  So  I 
think it’s great, and we love it. 

Senator PRYOR. We have a question or two. 
Commissioner  COPPS.  I  just  wanted  to  ask,  and  those  were  won-
derful  presentations.  Thank  you  for  sharing  them.  Is  there  a  gen-
eration  gap,  do  you  think?  With  some  of  the  folks  we’ve  talked 
about,  a  lot  of  people  don’t  understand  the  potential  of  this.  But 
don’t most young people really get it, or do you really see a problem 
even  among  your  peers—they  that  don’t  understand  the  potential 
of this stuff? 

Mr. MAYS. Actually, whenever we first started doing the surveys, 
we  actually  ran  a  test  on  our  school  to  see  how  realistic  it  would 
be  to  them.  And  in  our  actual  school  itself,  we  had  to  go  around 
the  class  and  actually  explain  what  every  word  was  to  them.  So, 
I  mean,  there  is  a  very  small  gap  between  the  actual  generations. 
But  there  is  still  a  gap.  I  would  love  for  everyone  to  be  able  to 
know what it is exactly, but there is still a lot of lack of knowledge 
like she said. 

Commissioner  ADELSTEIN.  Those  are  great  buttons.  Where’d  you 

get those ‘‘Got Broadband’’ buttons? 

Ms. SIVLEY. We made them. We have some—we may have more. 
Commissioner ADELSTEIN. That’s marketing. 
Ms. SIVLEY. Do you want one? You can have mine. 
Commissioner ADELSTEIN. No, thank you, though. 
Ms. SIVLEY. Thank you. 
Senator PRYOR. Matt—— 
Mr.  DOZIER.  As  you  can  see,  there  is  a  great  deal  of  capacity  in 
our  local  communities  and  within  our  youngest  citizens  to  engage 
in real work that can address local needs. What we believe we have 
demonstrated through this project is that a local engagement strat-
egy is the best way to not only educate people on larger issues, but 
also  to  allow  them  to  be  part  of  the  solution  rather  than  outsiders 
looking  in,  waiting  for  someone  else  to  solve  their  problems.  Stu-
dents like these are typical of EAST students. 

Believe me, they are typical of EAST students. But, indeed, they 
are  typical  of  all  students.  They  are  creative,  intuitive,  adaptable, 
and  ready  to  serve  in  their  communities.  We  all  benefit  when  we 
don’t  stand  in  their  way,  but  rather  stand  behind  them  and  give 
them the tools to take on challenges. Just as we brought electricity 
and  telephone  service  to  all  of  Arkansas  in  an  effort  to  keep  pace 
with the needs of the modern world, we can bring broadband access 
to every community to allow it to become a larger part of the wider 
world. This issue strikes at the core of communities of students like 
these.  This  is  truly  an  area  where  if  we  fail  to  act,  we  will  leave 
the generation behind. The EAST Initiative is dedicated to helping 
our  students  find  within  themselves  the  abilities  that  will  serve 
them and us well through their adult careers. They need your help 
as well. Thank you. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Thank  you.  Well,  now  we’re  getting  to  the  point 
in our panel, you know the old saying: Save the best for last. Well, 
we  didn’t  do  that.  I’m  just  kidding.  I’m  kidding.  No,  we  really  did. 
We’ve  talked  a  lot  about  the  need  for  broadband,  and  the  applica-
tion of broadband, and the promise and potential, the great things, 
the reason Arkansas needs to be where it needs to be.

But  the  next  panel  is  where  the  rubber  meets  the  road.  And 
these are the companies that provide broadband. And they want to 
talk about some of the challenges that they have in trying to deploy 
broadband, some of the things that they are doing, some of the in-
novations,  the  investments  that  they’re  making  in  our  state,  and  I 
know  that  because  I’ve  talked  to  many  of  them  on  previous  occa-
sions,  and  today  as  well.  I  know  that  we’re  going  to  hear  a  lot  of 
good  news  about  broadband,  but  we’re  also  going  to  hear  some 
about  the  challenge,  and  the  reality  is  that  it  is  a  challenge  to 
these  companies  that  have  investors  that  expect  a  great  return  on 
their  investments,  it’s  a  challenge  for  them  to  make  investments 
sometimes  if  there  is  not  some  sort  of  public/private  partnership. 
Universal Service Fund is something that I’m very interested in, 
something  like  a  rural  utility  service  loan  is  a  concept  that  we’re 
beating  around  up  in  Washington  to  see  if  that  might  work.  But 
this  next  panel  really  is,  in  my  view,  really  where  the  rubber  does 
meet  the  road,  because  we  need  to  help  these  companies  deploy 
broadband  and  increase  the  penetration  of  broadband  around  the 
state. One of the things I said in the beginning is I do have a con-
cern about two Americas, a rich America, a more densely-populated 
America that has access to broadband, and then a part of America 
that’s left behind. Rural America that just because they don’t have 
the  population  density,  maybe  they  don’t  have  the  wealth  or  the 
capital to cover other needs that employ broadband. 

So  the  two  commissioners  who  have  talked  about  this—this  is 
very similar to maybe what we saw in the 1920s, 1930s, with elec-
tricity,  maybe  what  it  was  like  in  the  1930s  with  telephones.  We 
need  to  help  in  any  way  we  can  and  make  sure  that  broadband 
gets out to every sector of the state of Arkansas, and, for that mat-
ter,  every  section  of  the  country.  So  what  I’d  like  to  do  now  is 
again,  say,  two-minute  statements  from  here  on.  First,  I’d  like  to 
introduce Scott Ford. 

STATEMENT OF SCOTT T. FORD, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

ALLTEL COMMUNICATIONS, INC. 

Mr. FORD. Thank you, Senator. I’m going to take one minute and 
just say thank you to the Commissioners and to yourself for coming 
down  and  hosting  this.  I  don’t  know  that  everybody  on  the  panel 
gets  the  chance  to  appear  before  you  as  regularly  as  I  do,  and  so 
I  really  just  want  to,  for  the  benefit  of  the  group,  make  sure  that 
they know what an honor it is that you two would come to Arkan-
sas.  Your  time  is  under  great  demand,  you  have  enormous  issues 
beyond  even  telecommunications  and  broadband  that  you  have  to 
deal  with.  This  is  not  an  easy  time  to  be  an  FCC  Commissioner, 
from  the  best  I  can  tell  from  looking  from  the  outside  in,  and  it’s 
great that you would take the time to come down here. We greatly 
appreciate it. You have been, particularly the leaders, making sure 
that companies that serve America serve all of America. 

As  you  know,  at  Alltel  we’re  the  largest  rural  provider  in  the 
wireless  business  in  the  country.  We  compete  for  capital  against 
companies like Verizon and T-Mobile and companies who generally 
only  serve  metropolitan  areas  and  the  freeway.  So  it’s  difficult  to 
attract  shareholder  capital  to  put  in  rural  America.  And  the  re-
forms that have been in place, through allowing wireless companies

to tap in as an ETC through the USF funds, has been an enormous 
help  to  building  cell  sites  and  to  providing  connectivity.  Arkansas 
just  this  year,  early  this  year,  under  Governor  Beebe’s  leadership, 
enacted—and  the  Public  Service  Commission—adopted  rules  that 
allow wireless companies in Arkansas to tap into USF. And we will 
be taking that money and building cell sites into rural America. 

So  we  are  slowly  making  progress  through  all  that.  I  must  also 
say,  Commissioner  Copps,  that  progress  was  going  to  be  killed  by 
the  wireline  companies  until  you  kind  of  singularly  voted  on  the 
Federal-State  Joint  Board  to  put  a  halt  to  that.  I  don’t  think  that 
you,  particularly,  were  perfectly  pleased  with  everything  that  was 
involved in that in terms of how it came out. And I know you want 
overall  reform,  and  I  know  that  everybody  wants  to  see  USF  re-
formed  on  a  holistic  basis.  Not  throwing  the  wireless  business 
under  the  bus  was  a  good  step  to  actually  bringing  everybody  to 
the  table  to  reform  that,  and  we  appreciate  it.  Senator  Pryor,  I’ll 
throw  out  three  things.  As  you  guys  think  about  take-aways  from 
this—first of all, we are grateful that you came. Second of all, think 
about  mobility  and  broadband.  Mobility  and  broadband  are  what 
the American consumer wants, it’s what they pay for, and it’s what 
they want, even those that can’t afford it. 

The second thing I ask you take away is the thought that as you 
add customers and you incur the expense of adding customers, you 
ought  to  gain  subsidy  for  that.  You  shouldn’t  gain  subsidy  for  los-
ing  customers  regardless  of  what  Mr.  Gardner’s  going  to  tell  you 
next. We used to get along great. Now we’re just arguing. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. FORD. That’s an attempt at humor. 
The  third  thing  is,  if  you  look  at  broadband,  it’s  not  a  road.  You 
don’t  build  it  and  then  just  come  back  and  check  on  it  every  now 
and  then  for  maintenance  and  potholes.  Broadband  requires  24- 
hour  monitoring.  It  is  very  expensive  to  provide,  once  we  build  it. 
If  you  look  at  the  wireline  telephone  system,  a  great  amount  of 
subsidy flows through to the actual retail user. The retail user only 
pays about half of what it costs to provide service to them. Whereas 
in  the  wireless  business,  customers  pay  in  the  97  to  98  percentile. 
Just a couple of other things for you to think through as you think 
about  the  fact  that  wireless  pays  in  $2.5  billion  into  the  USF  and 
only  takes  $1  billion  out.  Thank  you  very  much  for  coming.  We  do 
appreciate the time. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Ford follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SCOTT T. FORD, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

ALLTEL COMMUNICATIONS, INC. 

Senator  Pryor,  Commissioners  Copps  and  Adelstein,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  I 
would  like  to  welcome  you  to  Little  Rock,  and  to  thank  you  for  conducting  this  im-
portant field hearing here in our home town. I appreciate your invitation to partici-
pate  today,  and  am  pleased  and  honored  to  discuss  ways  to  sustain  and  promote 
the deployment of fixed and mobile broadband services, here in Arkansas and across 
the country. 

Alltel  provides  leading-edge,  digital  mobile  wireless  services  to  nearly  12  million 
wireless  customers  in  35  states,  including  several  hundred  thousand  here  through-
out  virtually  all  of  Arkansas.  We  operate  the  Nation’s  largest  wireless  network  in 
terms of geographic area served, but our customer base is smaller than those of the 
larger  carriers.  This  is  because  we  are  one  of  the  few  major  wireless  operators  to 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:23 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75776.TXT JACKIE

focus on serving the mid-size and smaller cities, as well as rural and more sparsely 
populated areas. 

We offer our customers a range of mobile broadband services that are increasingly 
important parts of our product mix. A majority of our handsets, including nearly all 
of our newly launched devices, support wireless broadband. Alltel is rapidly deploy-
ing  network  facilities  that  support  EV–DO-based  AxcessSM Broadband  service  that 
provides average speeds of 400–700 kilobits per second with bursts up to 2.4 mega-
bits  per  second.  These  technologies  support  web-based  e-mail,  text  and  photo-mes-
saging, mobile game and ring-tone downloads, mobile music and video, and Internet 
access  services  for  individual  consumers.  In  addition,  we  offer  enterprise  mobile 
data solutions used by government, public safety agencies, and industries as diverse 
as agriculture, education, finance, health care, and manufacturing. 

We provide these high-speed, advanced services in over 100 communities covering 
44 million people across our 35-state footprint. Here in our home state of Arkansas, 
we  will  provide  access  to  these  services  to  nearly  62  percent  of  the  households  by 
the end of this year. We are constantly building out broadband facilities and offering 
advanced services to additional communities. 

As  you  know,  consumers  increasingly  demand  higher-bandwidth  services:  across 
the  country,  purchases  of  broadband  lines  increased  by  52  percent  from  2005  to 
2006,  according  to  recent  FCC  reports,  including  an  increase  from  fewer  than 
400,000 wireless broadband lines in 2005 to over 11 million in 2006. Through inno-
vative  service  features  and  plans,  wireless  carries  are  bringing  additional  competi-
tion  to  the  broadband  marketplace  and  offering  American  consumers  unique  ways 
to  stay  connected  to  information.  Broadband  services—both  fixed  and  mobile—are 
absolutely  vital  for  the  21st  century  economy.  But  clearly  much  more  needs  to  be 
done  to  bring  broadband  services  out  to  consumers.  According  to  the  latest  FCC 
high-speed report, fewer than 13 percent of Arkansas residents had broadband serv-
ice as of June 30, 2006. 

Consumers  also  increasingly  need  and  depend  on  mobile  wireless  services  of  all 
kinds,  for  voice  as  well  as  data.  Over  the  past  5  years,  the  number  of  mobile  wire-
less subscribers has grown by 86 percent, from 118 million in June 2001 to 219 mil-
lion in June 2006. According to FCC data, mobile wireless service across the country 
has  grown  by  50  percent  during  the  3  years  ending  in  December  2005,  and  con-
sumers now use more wireless than wireline phone lines. Here in Arkansas, Alltel’s 
mobile  wireless  customer  base  has  grown  by  24  percent  over  the  past  3  years.  U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services conducted a survey and found that over 
12 percent of households in the country are using wireless as their only phone serv-
ice. And among consumers with more than one connection, a substantial proportion 
now use wireless as a primary means of communications. Without question, wireless 
communications is the ‘‘lifeline’’ of today’s consumers. 

Rural  consumers  have  the  same  interests  in  obtaining  access  to  high-speed  tech-
nologies  and  mobile  services,  and  are  demonstrating  changes  in  demand  that  par-
allel  those  of  consumers  across  the  country.  If  anything,  mobile  wireless  services 
may be even more important to rural consumers than to those in urban areas. Peo-
ple in rural areas often spend more time than their urban counterparts on the road. 
For  example,  an  entrepreneur  may  need  to  reach  contacts  when  driving  from  one 
end  of  a  large  county  to  another  for  business;  a  parent  may  need  access  to  tele-
communications  while  driving  children  to  and  from  relatively  distant  schools;  and 
a farmer may need access to data on agricultural prices while working on a remote 
part  of  his  or  her  property.  Wireless  broadband  is  often  the  only  means  of  high- 
speed  access  in  many  high-cost  areas  and  is  playing  a  major  role  in  bridging  the 
‘‘broadband divide.’’ 

Rural residents and public safety ‘‘first responders’’ particularly value their mobile 
wireless  services  in  emergency  situations.  Mobile  9-1-1  and  E–911  are  vital  health 
and  safety  services,  especially  for  people  who  frequently  have  to  travel  long  dis-
tances—and  more  than  240,000  wireless  E–911  calls  are  made  every  day.  But  they 
cannot be provided unless adequate infrastructure and service is available. But due 
to  the  relatively  high  costs  of  deploying  wireline  and  wireless  networks  in  many 
rural  areas,  we  all  need  to  do  more  to  make  sure  consumers  in  rural  areas  have 
access  to  these  services.  In  our  state,  the  86th  General  Assembly  of  the  Arkansas 
legislature passed a bill last year to create the ‘‘Connect Arkansas’’ program and the 
Arkansas Broadband Advisory Council, which are working to monitor, educate, pro-
mote  and  facilitate  the  deployment  and  adoption  of  broadband  Internet  services. 
Several  members  from  this  initiative  are  here  today  and  I  congratulate  them  for 
their efforts to bring advanced telecommunications services to our state. 

Senator Pryor, I would like to commend you for your strong commitment to ensur-
ing  that  citizens  of  rural  parts  of  Arkansas  and  across  the  country  have  access  to 
high-quality  fixed  and  mobile  broadband  services,  as  well  as  other  mobile  wireless

services.  The  important  legislation  that  you  co-sponsored  with  Senators  Smith  and 
Dorgan—S.  711,  the  ‘‘Universal  Service  for  the  21st  Century  Act’’  of  2007—wisely 
recognizes that any technology, including wireless, can be included in the definition 
of ‘‘broadband communications service,’’ as long as it operates at the specified high- 
speed  and  enables  users  to  originate  and  receive  high-quality  voice,  data,  graphics, 
and video communications. Your forward-thinking legislation also recognizes the im-
portance of universal service funding to support and extend both broadband services 
and  mobility  to  unserved  and  underserved  rural  areas.  Until  just  recently,  only  a 
negligible amount of universal service funding was going to support the deployment 
of  wireless  service  to  high-cost  areas—even  though  consumers  in  those  areas  des-
perately  need  and  want  wireless  technology  and  networks.  Of  the  $25  billion  spent 
on high-cost universal service since 1996, only about $2 billion has gone to wireless 
carriers and other competitors. Even today, less than 25 percent of universal service 
high-cost funds go to support the deployment of wireless service, even though there 
are  now  more  wireless  subscribers.  At  the  same  time,  wireless  contributes  more 
than  twice  the  amount  into  the  universal  service  fund  than  it  receives  out  of  the 
fund. 

The 1996 amendment to the Communications Act making non-wireline carriers el-
igible  for  universal  service  support  has  made  possible  a  tremendous  expansion  of 
wireless  service  into  rural  areas.  With  universal  service  support,  Alltel  and  other 
wireless  carriers  are  building  facilities  deep  into  rural  areas,  not  just  along  major 
highways, and delivering service to consumers where they live and work. According 
to  the  FCC,  wireless  penetration  rates  went  up  from  41  percent  in  2001  to  68  per-
cent  in  2005  in  the  most  sparsely  populated  areas  with  fewer  than  100  residents 
per square mile. 

America  is  getting  a  great  return  on  its  investment  in  wireless  universal  service. 
It’s  true  that  support  for  wireless  has  increased  over  the  past  few  years.  But  that 
has  come  with  a  tremendous  expansion  of  wireless  service  into  rural  areas.  In  the 
past,  many  wireless  companies  were  building  cell  sites  only  along  major  highways 
and population centers. Now, with universal service support, we are building facili-
ties  deep  into  rural  areas  and  getting  service  out  to  consumers  who  live  and  work 
there. For example, on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, the Tribe esti-
mated  that  less  than  30  percent  of  the  population  had  telephone  service  prior  to 
Alltel’s  entry  into  the  market  as  a  wireless  universal  service  provider.  Today  more 
than 80 percent of the population on the Pine Ridge reservation has access to wire-
less telephone service. The vast majority of these consumers are eligible for and re-
ceiving a discounted Lifeline service of only $1 per month. This is the true meaning 
of universal service. 

We  are  concerned  with  short-sighted  views  that  fail  to  recognize  the  importance 
of  wireless  universal  service.  Support  for  rural  wireless  is  not  a  problem—and  an 
anti-competitive proposal to reduce universal service funding for wireless consumers 
is  not  the  answer.  Alltel  appreciates  the  letter  that  you  submitted  to  the  Federal- 
State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service,  jointly  with  Senators  Rockefeller,  Dorgan, 
Klobuchar,  and  Smith,  opposing  the  plan  to  restrict  universal  service  funding  for 
wireless carriers by imposing a cap exclusively on competitive eligible telecommuni-
cations carriers. 

We  share  your  hope  that  the  Joint  Board  and  the  FCC  abandon  counter-produc-
tive  ‘‘interim  measures.’’  Instead,  they  should  follow  the  lead  of  the  Senate  Com-
merce Committee, and turn their attention to equitable and sensible comprehensive 
reform  of  the  universal  service  program.  Rather  than  continuing  to  target  funds 
mainly to the traditional voice telephone services of the last century, the Universal 
Service Fund should be realigned to promote the services that consumers most need 
and demand going forward: broadband and mobility. 

Senator Pryor, in your letter to the Joint Board, you said that long term universal 
service  reform  should  result  in  a  competitively  neutral  system,  promote  account-
ability  in  how  the  funds  are  used,  and  promote  the  build-out  of  advanced  services 
in rural regions through effective targeting of funds to high cost areas. Alltel firmly 
agrees.  But  we  find  it  puzzling  that  some  still  argue  that  ‘‘universal  service  is  not 
about competition.’’ Ever since the adoption of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 
our  Nation’s  policy  has  been  to  favor  competition  for  all  communications  services, 
in  all  markets.  Competition  is  the  best  way  to  assure  high  quality  services,  rapid 
advancement  and  deployment  of  new  technologies,  and  low  prices.  Why  would  any-
one  want  to  take  away  the  benefits  of  competition  from  consumers  in  rural  areas? 
The FCC’s policies up to now have correctly attempted to promote both universal 
service  and  competition  at  the  same  time,  by  moving  toward  a  system  of  funding 
portability. Some argue, however, that portability and competitive neutrality are in-
appropriate.  We  disagree.  The  purpose  of  universal  service  is  to  benefit  customers, 
not  carriers,  so  high  cost  support  should  be  directed  to  the  services  that  customers

decide  to  buy.  Providers  should  have  to  show  that  they  are  using  the  support  for 
its  intended  purpose  in  order  to  receive  funding;  they  shouldn’t  retain  funds  when 
they  are  losing  consumers.  Some  components  of  today’s  overall  Federal  universal 
service  funding  system  are  fully  portable,  but  others  are  not.  Under  the  non-port-
able  funding  mechanisms,  certain  carriers  continue  to  receive  universal  service 
funding even when customers no longer want to buy service from them. This makes 
no sense and is causing unnecessary increases in the size of the fund. Wireless car-
riers,  in  contrast,  lose  support  when  they  lose  customers.  To  protect  consumer 
choice,  accountability,  and  an  efficient  use  of  funding,  this  Committee  should  exer-
cise  its  oversight  over  the  FCC  to  ensure  that  the  universal  service  system  moves 
toward  greater  portability—not  less.  Portability  will  ensure  the  steady  deployment 
of  basic  and  advanced  services  to  rural  consumers.  We  fear  that  the  Joint  Board’s 
current drive toward moving wireless carriers to a ‘‘cost based’’ system will overlook 
the  fundamental  flaws  with  the  current  incumbent-biased  funding  system.  We  look 
forward  to  helping  you,  Senator  Pryor,  to  make  sure  that  sensible  and  equitable 
long-term reforms are implemented instead of ones whose practical effect is to inoc-
ulate  incumbent  carriers  from  any  and  all  form  of  the  competitive  pressures  that 
wireless carriers like Alltel and others face daily. 

In sum, Alltel applauds this Committee’s emphasis on promoting universal access 
to both broadband and mobility services in rural America. A reformed, pro-competi-
tive  universal  service  fund  could  be  one  of  the  most  effective  tools  to  achieve  these 
twin  objectives.  We  look  forward  to  working  with  this  Committee,  the  Joint  Board, 
and the FCC to advance the objective of promoting the deployment of both fixed and 
mobile communications technologies and services on a competitive basis in all parts 
of the country. 
Thank you.

STATEMENT OF JEFF GARDNER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

WINDSTREAM CORPORATION 

Mr.  GARDNER.  Good  morning,  Senator  Pryor,  Commissioner 
Adelstein,  and  Commissioner  Copps,  and  other  distinguished 
guests.  I  am  Jeff  Gardner,  President  and  CEO  of  Windstream,  the 
largest  local  exchange  company  in  the  country  focused  on  serving 
rural  America.  On  behalf  of  our  more  than  8,000  employees,  I  am 
proud  to  extend  a  warm  welcome  to  Little  Rock,  the  home  of  our 
headquarters,  and  to  Arkansas  where  we  provide  communications 
and entertainment services to more than 160,000 customers. 

Windstream has more than 3.2 million voice customers and more 
than 750,000 broadband customers across the 16 states we operate 
in. As a result of our aggressive deployment of broadband services, 
83 percent of our voice customers can purchase high-speed Internet 
access services. Remarkably, we have achieved these high levels of 
accessibility  and  penetration  in  rural  America  while  receiving  less 
than  one  percent  of  our  annual  revenue  from  Federal  Universal 
Service  High-Cost  support.  With  an  average  density  of  slightly 
more than 20 customers per square mile, we clearly understand the 
many  geographic  and  economic  challenges  that  must  be  overcome 
to  increase  our  country’s  broadband  service  adoption  rates.  But 
while  many  are  calling  for  expansion  of  the  Federal  Universal 
Service program, to support broadband build-out, I would urge pol-
icymakers  to  consider  other  alternatives  before  making  a  decision. 
As  you  know,  the  existing  universal  service  program  is  in  dire 
need  of  comprehensive  reform.  We  are  encouraged  by  the  policy-

makers’  recent  focus  on  this  reform.  While  increasing  broadband 
adoption rates is an important national goal, it should only be con-
sidered  in  tandem  with  comprehensive  reform.  Any  Federal  pro-
gram  including  universal  service  designed  to  increase  broadband 
adoption  rates  should  address  the  consumers’  ability  to  afford 
broadband  service.  As  stated  in  my  pre-filed  testimony,  policy-
makers  may  want  to  consider  funding  to  offset  the  cost  of 
broadband access for low income consumers and allocating funds to 
increase personal computer ownership. I applaud your efforts to or-
ganize this hearing. 

I  thank  you  for  taking  the  time  to  come  to  Arkansas,  and  look 
forward  to  working  productively  in  partnership  with  the  policy-
makers  to  move  Americans  and  Arkansans  to  their  rightful  place 
at the forefront of broadband service adoption race. Thank you. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gardner follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEFF GARDNER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

WINDSTREAM CORPORATION 

Thank  you,  Senator  Pryor  and  the  Senate  Commerce  Committee,  for  the  invita-
tion to speak at the hearing today. I also would like to extend an Arkansas welcome 
to Commissioners Copps and Adelstein. 

My  name  is  Jeff  Gardner.  I  am  the  President  and  CEO  of  Windstream  Corpora-
tion,  a  wireline  telecommunications  company  that  provides  voice,  broadband,  and 
entertainment  services  to  primarily  rural  communities  in  Arkansas  and  15  other 
states. The company, which is headquartered here in Little Rock, has approximately 
3.2 million access lines. 

Windstream  has  been  an  active  participant  in  developing  Federal  broadband  pol-
icy.  For  example,  Windstream  supports  the  U.S.  Senate  Commerce  Committee’s 
broadband  mapping  efforts.  We  worked  closely  with  Senate  staff  to  encourage 
broadband  subscription  mapping  at  a  census  tract  level,  and  we  are  pleased  to  see 
that census tract mapping is included in the latest version of the bill. Using census 
tracts  as  a  common  denominator,  broadband  maps  will  provide  greater  insight  into 
the  relationship  between  broadband  adoption  rates  and  other  socioeconomic  factors 
tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau. 

We at Windstream share Senator Pryor’s desire to ensure all Arkansans—and all 
Americans  for  that  matter—can  fully  participate  in  the  digital  world.  Deployment 
of  broadband  service  is  a  strategic  imperative  for  our  company.  In  2006  alone,  we 
grew  the  number  of  our  broadband  customers  by  46  percent  to  more  than  656,000 
customers,  and  as  of  second  quarter  this  year,  we  have  approximately  753,000 
broadband customers nationwide. 

We  are  continuing  to  upgrade  our  networks  and  increase  the  percentage  of  our 
customers with broadband access. This year alone we expect to spend between $350 
and  $380  million  on  capital  expenditures,  of  which  a  significant  portion  is  devoted 
to broadband. Now more than 80 percent of our voice customers can purchase wired 
broadband service from us, and as the Internet becomes more important to our cus-
tomers,  they  are  using  a  rapidly  increasing  amount  of  bandwidth.  Our  subscribers’ 
bandwidth usage doubled over the last year. 

Windstream’s  broadband  investments  extend  to  Arkansas.  Windstream  is  the 
third  largest  ILEC  in  the  state.  We  serve  predominantly  rural  areas,  from  Elaine 
in the Delta to Wilmot in southeast Arkansas, but also some larger exchanges, such 
as Harrison. Harrison actually was our company’s first exchange to offer DSL. 

In  Arkansas,  we  offer  broadband  at  speeds  of  1.5  Mbps,  3  Mbps,  and  6  Mbps. 
Prices of these services may range from $19.99 to $29.99, when a customer bundles 
broadband service with voice or digital TV. 

Windstream  also  has  CLEC  operations  in  central  and  northwest  Arkansas.  As  a 
CLEC,  we  provide  critical  communications  services,  including  broadband  data  serv-
ices, to Arkansas hospitals and the state government. 

Windstream  will  continue  to  offer  DSL  deeper  in  our  markets  and  at  faster 
speeds.  In  Arkansas  and  other  states,  we  are  upgrading  our  network  to  enable  us 
to introduce broadband speeds of 10 to 12 Mbps, and we expect to complete this ef-
fort late this year or early next year. 

But these build-out efforts are only one piece of ensuring all individuals can fully 
participate in the digital world. Broadband subscribership rates depend not only on

a consumer’s geographic access to broadband, but also on a consumer’s economic ac-
cess  to  and  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  broadband.  Consumer  economic  factors  in-
clude  both  the  affordability  of  broadband  service  and  the  ability  to  purchase  a  per-
sonal  computer.  Pulling  a  variety  of  different  levers  is  necessary  to  increase 
broadband adoption rates broadly and effectively. 

I  believe  that  many  are  overly  focused  on  pulling  one  lever:  obtaining  Federal 
funds  to  help  offset  the  cost  of  constructing  their  broadband  networks.  However, 
there are three notable problems with advocating this solution in isolation. 

First, if the goal is 100 percent terrestrial broadband deployment and subscription 
at  affordable  rates,  achievement  of  this  goal  will  require  the  Federal  Government 
to  spend  considerable  resources  to  offset  the  high  cost  of  network  build-out. 
Windstream,  like  other  broadband  service  providers,  has  found  that  its  costs  in-
crease  exponentially  as  we  attempt  to  provide  broadband  access  to  our  remaining 
unserved customers. 

As  we  reach  into  our  unserved  areas,  we  face  a  number  of  challenges:  We  may 
need to shorten the, often significant, distance between potential customers and the 
closest  DSLAM,  the  point  where  a  digital  subscriber  line  is  connected  to  the  Inter-
net.  We  also  may  need  to  lease  transport  from  other  carriers  to  connect  our  facili-
ties,  which  in  some  cases  can  be  very  isolated,  to  the  national  Internet  backbone. 
The  potential  number  of  broadband  customers  may  not  sustain  these  additional  in-
vestments. 

Here’s a rough sketch of our predicted capital costs for deploying broadband serv-
ice to the rest of our customers: It will cost Windstream a considerable sum to pro-
vide  broadband  service  to  an  additional  5  percent  of  our  customer  base.  To  provide 
broadband to the next 5 percent slice of our customers, we expect it will cost us ap-
proximately  two  times  that  amount.  For  5  percent  more,  approximately  four  times 
that amount. Deploying broadband to the next 5 percent of our unserved customers, 
in  other  words,  will  cost  us  approximately  twice  as  much  as  what  it  cost  us  to  de-
ploy  to  the  last  5  percent  of  our  unserved  customers.  And  as  these  customers  de-
mand higher speeds, our expenses increase still further as we upgrade our networks 
to support greater bandwidth. 

Sponsoring  universal  build-out  of  terrestrial  broadband  networks  would  undoubt-
edly  cost  many  billions  of  dollars.  Providing  exclusive  attention  to  ensuring  uni-
versal  terrestrial  broadband  deployment—as  opposed  to  increasing  subscribership 
where  broadband  is  already  available—may  drain  Federal  resources  that  could  be 
focused on other factors that might have a greater impact on our Nation’s adoption 
rates. 

For some consumers, it may make more sense to invest in other technological so-
lutions,  which  may  be  more  affordable.  Diverse  technologies—such  as  satellite 
broadband—are providing new paths around geographic obstacles. 

Second,  focusing  solely  on  broadband  build-out  costs  overlooks  the  significance  of 
the  accompanying  operating  costs.  Yet  any  successful  broadband  deployment  strat-
egy must properly account for both capital and operating expenditures. 

Just  because  a  functioning  broadband  network  is  built,  does  not  automatically 
mean that it would make economic sense for a provider to operate that network. In-
deed, in many areas, including some of our smaller exchanges in Arkansas, we have 
determined that we would not likely obtain enough broadband subscribers at afford-
able  rates  under  current  conditions  to  cover  our  incremental  operating  costs.  So  in 
order  to  keep  broadband  service  affordable,  providers  likely  will  need  additional 
funding to help cover ongoing operating expenses. 

Third,  even  if  sufficient  funding  could  be  devoted  to  creating  a  fully  operational 
broadband  network  throughout  the  United  States,  it  still  does  not  mean  all  Ameri-
cans  would  be  able  to  purchase  broadband  service.  A  deployment-focused  solution, 
without more, assumes ‘‘if you build it, they will come.’’ 

But clearly that is not the case. Overall broadband adoption, in part, is a function 
of  geographic  access,  but  as  I  noted  before,  it  also  is  a  function  of  economic  access 
and  consumer  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  advanced  technologies.  Many  recent 
press reports on the fate of municipal wireless networks have observed that multiple 
factors ultimately are responsible for consumers’ broadband adoption rates. 

So where does this assessment leave us? For Windstream, this analysis has made 
us look more carefully at the other levers that may be pulled to increase broadband 
adoption  rates.  While  we  aggressively  deploy  new  facilities,  we  continue  to  think 
about new and innovative ways in which we can increase broadband adoption where 
we have already deployed the service. 

Public-private partnerships, such as Connect Arkansas, may further promote low- 
income  consumers’  broadband  usage.  Windstream  was  an  active  participant  in  the 
Arkansas Broadband Initiative, which led to the development of Connect Arkansas. 
We  anticipate  that  Connect  Arkansas  will  be  able  to  leverage  resources  of  a  wide

variety of stakeholders to bring more Arkansans online. We have witnessed the im-
portance  of

cross-sector  partnerships  as  a 

In particular, our experience has underscored the importance of a non-geographic 
factor  that  contributes  to  broadband  adoption  rates:  affordability.  The  gap  between 
those  consumers  who  are  online  and  offline  more  and  more  is  defined  by  their  eco-
nomic, rather than geographic, conditions. 

Focusing  on  affordability  is  important  and  in  many  cases  actually  may  be  the 
basis  for  more  economically  efficient  policies  to  increase  broadband  adoption  rates. 
As such, in addition to dedicating funds to aid deployment in unserved areas, policy-
makers  should  (a)  devote  funding  to  provide  support  for  low-income  consumers’ 
broadband access and (b) allocate funds to increase computer ownership. 

With  respect  to  making  broadband  service  more  affordable,  the  Federal  Govern-
ment should strongly consider the use of general revenues, instead of universal serv-
ice  funds,  to  subsidize  broadband  service  for  low-income  consumers.  But  if  policy-
makers  conclude  it  is  appropriate  to  use  universal  service  funds,  they  should  con-
sider  extending  Lifeline/Link-Up  to  assist  low-income  consumers’  purchase  of 
broadband services. 

Addressing economic access to broadband will help a significant percentage of Ar-
kansas  consumers  that  remain  offline.  According  to  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  only 
12  percent  of  Arkansas  residents  that  live  in  households  earning  less  than  $15,000 
per year use the Internet at home.1 

In  addition,  Windstream  recommends  that  the  Federal  Government  consider  pro-
viding  some  funding  for  low-income  individuals’  personal  computer  ownership.  If 
consumers cannot afford a computer, they will not be able to use broadband in their 
homes—no matter how reasonably priced that broadband service may be. 

Among  the  50  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia,  Arkansas  ranks  last,  50th,  in 
the  percentage  of  households  with  a  personal  computer.2 And  personal  PC  owner-
ship,  like  Internet  usage,  is  highly  correlated  with  household  income:  83  percent  of 
households in Arkansas earning less than $15,000 per year do not own a computer, 
compared to 38 percent of all households nationally.3 

At  Windstream,  we  are  experimenting  with  ways  in  which  we  can  help  more  of 
our  customers  afford  household  computers.  For  example,  this  month  we  launched 
a pilot program to offer discounted computers to qualified new broadband customers 
who purchase broadband service from our company. 

Although there is much private industry can do, the private sector on its own can-
not resolve issues around low-income consumers’ ability to afford computers. Policy-
makers  should  give  serious  consideration  to  what  role  the  government  can  play  in 
addressing computer affordability. 

Going  forward  we’re  going  to  need  to  wade  into  the  details  of  how  these  various 
proposals  could  best  be  implemented.  Windstream  is  committed  to  devoting  re-
sources to these ideas, and we look forward to partnering with the Federal Govern-
ment to develop new and innovative ways to boost broadband adoption in Arkansas 
and throughout the United States. 

Thank you for allowing my company and me to participate in this hearing.

GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS, AT&T ARKANSAS 

Mr.  ALLIS.  Thank  you,  Senator.  I  don’t  use  hair  spray,  but  I’m 
thinking  about  starting.  I  appreciate  the  EAST  labs  presentation. 
I  think  that  was  a  real  bright  spot  for  us  today.  My  name  is  Ed 
Allis, Executive Director of Governmental Affairs for AT&T. A field 
hearing like this is a unique experience I think for most of us, and 
we  do  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  provide  a  local  perspective  on 
the  issues  before  the  Committee.  Perhaps  the  main  thing  I’d  like 
to  do  today  is  to  lend  AT&T’s  endorsement  to  Connect  Arkansas 
and EAST labs. And I will talk about that in just a minute.

First,  just  a  bit  about  AT&T.  We  are  the  state’s  largest  and  old-
est  provider.  We’ve  been  around  for  almost  130  years.  And  while 
we serve most of the metro areas in the state, we maintain a very 
significant  rural  presence.  Of  AT&T’s  102  exchanges  across  the 
state, fully 40 of them have less than a thousand access lines. Six-
teen  have  fewer  than  500  access  lines.  One  of  our  exchanges,  Ar-
kansas  City,  has  only  100  lines.  So  we  are  familiar  with  the  chal-
lenges  of  serving  rural  Arkansas.  This  fact-finding  hearing  comes 
not a moment too soon. Arkansas must catch up. 

Senator Pryor, you said Arkansas ranks 47th in the Nation right 
now,  and  that’s  certainly  a  challenge  for  all  of  us.  But  there  are 
areas where progress has been made. I think all the presenters can 
talk  about  some  of  their  success  stories.  For  AT&T’s  part,  we  can 
also  point  to  progress.  We  are  expanding  the  availability  of  our 
wireline  DSL  in  our  footprint.  And,  in  fact,  we  expect  to  have  all 
of  our  exchanges  equipped  for  DSL  by  the  end  of  next  year,  2008. 
We  are  also  proud  of  our  affiliation  with  Distance  Learning  that 
was  mentioned  by  Ms.  Bailey.  She  covered  that,  and  I  won’t  talk 
about it in any great detail other than from an educational perspec-
tive,  we  have  80  higher  ed  sites  on  that  system,  and  over  300  K 
through  12  sites.  AT&T  provides  network  facilities  and  maintains 
network  facilities  for  that  system.  That  is  a  tremendous  asset,  I 
think, to rural Arkansas and to rural school districts. 

But  as  everyone  agrees,  there  is  much  to  be  done.  And  while 
AT&T  is  committed  to  proceeding  with  its  broadband  initiatives, 
we  have  become  convinced  that  Connect  Arkansas  may  very  well 
hold the key for the most rapid advancement of broadband deploy-
ment  in  the  state.  With  their  mapping  capabilities  in  conjunction 
with  EAST,  their  formation  of  e-committees,  educational  efforts, 
and demand stimulation programs, they hold promise for some ben-
efits that could be substantial and very tangible. 

Connect  Arkansas,  I  think,  would  tell  you  that  they  can  create 
over  8,000  jobs  in  the  state  and  that  they  can  add  $2.6  billion  to 
the  state  gross  domestic  product  annually.  So  it’s  something  that 
we  all  need  to  pay  attention  to.  As  with  all  things  of  that  sort, 
funding is the issue. At least initially, Connect Arkansas will have 
to operate with private funding only. 

So I think Federal funding either from the Congressional side or 
the FCC side is desperately needed both for Connect Arkansas and 
for  providers.  And  I  know  as  policymakers,  you  all  have  to  make 
decisions  about  how  much  money  to  spend  and  where  it’s  going  to 
go and to set the priorities. And as you’re doing that, please, please 
remember  Arkansas,  keep  us  on  your  radar  screen.  If  you  do  fund 
us, we’ll make you proud of the investment. Thanks.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF EDWARD K. ALLIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 

GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS, AT&T ARKANSAS 

Introduction 

My  name  is  Ed  Allis.  I  am  the  Executive  Director—Governmental  Affairs  for 
AT&T in the state of Arkansas. My biographical summary was previously submitted 
for  the  record.  AT&T  extends  a  warm  welcome  to  Commissioners  Adelstein  and 
Copps.  A  field  hearing  such  as  this  is  a  unique  experience  for  those  of  us  involved 
in the telecommunications industry and all of us are appreciative of this opportunity 
to provide a local perspective on ‘‘The State of Broadband in Arkansas.’’

AT&T Arkansas traces its roots back to the state’s first switchboard in 1879, right 
here in Little Rock—almost 130 years ago, just 3 years after Alexander Graham Bell 
invented the telephone. Today, AT&T is the state’s oldest and largest provider; serv-
ing  102  local  exchanges  across  the  state.  In  addition  to  landline  service,  we  offer 
high-speed  broadband  Internet  access,  wireless  and  satellite  TV  service  to  commu-
nities  large  and  small.  AT&T’s  commitment  to  rural  Arkansas  should  be  apparent. 
This  fact  finding  hearing  comes  not  a  moment  too  soon.  Along  with  most  others 
from  whom  you  will  hear  today,  AT&T  considers  the  timing  critical  for  Arkansas’ 
future. I believe we have come to recognize that we are in a race, not just with other 
states—but with other nations as well. Simply stated, Arkansas must first catch up 
before  it  can  surpass  others.  By  now  you  are  aware  of  Connect  Arkansas  and  the 
broadband  data  collection  activities  in  which  it  has  engaged.  According  to  Connect 
Arkansas, Arkansas ranks: 

• 47th in the deployment of broadband. 
• 49th in the percentage of the population online. 
• 41st in the percentage of farmers using computers online. 
• 30th  in  the  use  of  information  technology  to  deliver  state  government  services. 
Despite  those  statistics,  the  Committee  should  note  that  Arkansas  has  made  sig-
nificant progress in bringing technology to rural parts of the state. Some of the pre-
senters  today  have  outlined  some  of  that  progress  in  their  areas  of  knowledge  or 
will shortly. 
AT&T 

For its part, AT&T has demonstrated a fundamental commitment to rural Amer-
ica and rural Arkansas in a number of ways. While there may be some that believe 
AT&T  is  a  company  that  provides  telecommunications  services  only  to  urban  areas 
of  the  country,  that’s  simply  not  the  case.  In  fact,  AT&T  is  the  single  largest  pro-
vider  of  telephone  service  to  rural  America—we  serve  over  7  million  rural  cus-
tomers. 

In Arkansas, of AT&T’s 102 exchanges, 57 have fewer than 3,000 access lines; 40 
have fewer than 1,000 access lines and 16 have fewer than 500. One exchange, Ar-
kansas  City,  has  just  100  access  lines.  Beyond  doubt,  AT&T  is  a  rural  provider  in 
Arkansas  and  across  America  and  has  demonstrated  a  commitment  to  those  areas. 
For  example,  in  the  past  2  years  AT&T  has  contributed  grants  of  $4.6M  to  sup-
port the needs of various rural communities throughout the country. It is expanding 
the availability of broadband over satellite (provided by WildBlue) across its 22 state 
wireline  footprint.  At  the  same  time,  AT&T  has  deployed  additional  wireline 
broadband  in  Arkansas  this  year  and  plans  additional  deployment  in  2008.  AT&T 
anticipates that every Arkansas exchange will have broadband capability by the end 
of 2008. 

In  Arkansas,  AT&T  is  particularly  proud  of  its  involvement  in  distance  learning. 
AT&T  provides  and  maintains  network  facilities  used  by  the  State  of  Arkansas  for 
VNet,  a  fully  interactive  video  conferencing  network  used  for  education,  healthcare 
and state government. There are approximately 520 interactive video sites on VNet, 
including: 

• 78 higher education. 
• 301 Kindergarten through grade 12. 
Usage  has  grown  to  over  20,000  conference  hours  per  month.  More  than  400 
courses are being taught using the technology, giving students access to an enriched 
curriculum  and  college  preparatory  courses  and  providing  professional  development 
opportunities  and  instructional  resources  for  teachers  and  administrators.  Both 
AT&T and the state have garnered numerous awards for VNet. 

AT&T  was  one  of  the  first  major  providers  to  commercially  launch  fixed  wireless 
broadband using wireless and other technologies. Fixed wireless offers the potential 
to  deliver  broadband  Internet  to  areas  where  wireline  high-speed  Internet  or  cable 
modem services are not available today. 

Setting aside the consumer segment for a moment it should be noted that regard-
less  of  location,  most  businesses  in  Arkansas  generally  have  access  to  high-speed 
Internet  access.  Through  high  capacity  facilities,  even  remotely  located  businesses 
generally  can  obtain  high-speed  Internet  access,  but  it’s  at  prices  that  only  a  busi-
ness can reasonably be expected to pay. 

Yet,  despite  the  strides  that  have  been  made  there  is  still  much  to  be  done.  If 
the  provision  of  broadband  in  rural  Arkansas  was  easy,  it  would  be  there  today. 
However,  significant  hurdles  stand  in  the  way  in  many  areas.  That’s  why  AT&T  is

committed to helping to develop collaborative, innovative solutions at both the state 
and local level. 

While  AT&T  intends  to  continue  its  pursuit  of  its  own  broadband  initiatives, 
AT&T  is  convinced  that  Connect  Arkansas  holds  the  key  for  the  most  rapid  accel-
eration of broadband deployment by all providers. 
Connect Arkansas 

Connect  Arkansas  is  an  entity  that  is  uniquely  equipped  to  coordinate  all  of  the 

various resources in the state for a common purpose. 

It  is  common  knowledge  that  Connect  Arkansas  has  used  ConnectKentucky  as  a 

model. There are good reasons for this as statistics from Kentucky demonstrate. 

Before  ConnectKentucky,  approximately  60  percent  of  that  state  had  access  to 

broadband service. Today: 

• Over 93 percent of the state has broadband access. 
• Over  $600M  of  private  capital  has  been  invested  in  broadband  related  tele-

communications. 

• Broadband usage has increased by a nation leading 73 percent. 
• ConnectKentucky  anticipates  the  creation  of  over  15,000  jobs  and  the  addition 

of over $5B to the Gross State Product annually. 

Connect  Arkansas  was  established  by  Act  604  (sponsored  by  Senator  Capps) 
passed by the 86th General Assembly earlier this year. Among other things it is de-
signed  to  map  broadband  availability  in  Arkansas  and  stimulate  demand  through 
education of users regarding the benefits of broadband. Much of this education will 
be  coordinated  through  county  officials  and  volunteers.  Since  Connect  Arkansas  is 
a  private  non-profit  entity,  it  will  be  able  to  enter  into  non-disclosure  agreements 
with  all  providers  so  that  proprietary  competitive  data  can  be  collected  and  ana-
lyzed. That will be a key component of the mapping process. 

Connect  Arkansas’  efforts  will  be  technology  neutral.  Recommendations  and  pro-
posals  for  individual  underserved  areas  of  rural  Arkansas  may  depend  on  an  anal-
ysis  of  which  technology  appears  to  be  most  suitable.  While  an  approach  like  this 
will  require  extraordinary  cooperation  among  all  participants,  it  is  a  cornerstone  of 
the Connect Arkansas program and inherent in Act 604. 

If  Connect  Arkansas  is  successful,  the  state  as  a  whole  will  reap  substantial  and 
tangible  benefits.  Connect  Arkansas  has  estimated  that  8,200  jobs  will  be  created 
and over $2.6B will be added to the Gross State Product annually. 
Funding 

For the time being Connect Arkansas is without the public funding that could be 
used  for  educating  consumers,  establishing  e-committees  and  training  county  offi-
cials,  providing  grants,  etc.  The  initial  source  of  funding  must  come  from  private 
sources  and  perhaps  state  government  agencies  and  educational  institutions  that 
have the available resources. 

Ideally,  Connect  Arkansas  would  be  funded  through  a  tri-partite  partnership  of 
Federal funds, state funds and private funding. While the Arkansas General Assem-
bly will likely be asked to make state funding available in the future, it will be help-
ful if sources of Federal funds could be found. All of the involved parties in Connect 
Arkansas  would  be  willing  to  work  with  Senator  Pryor’s  office  and  other  members 
of  the  Committee  in  order  to  facilitate  an  investment  of  this  type  in  Arkansas’  fu-
ture. 

The  FCC  as  well  has  the  capacity  to  influence  the  economic  future  of  this  state. 
In July of this year, AT&T submitted an ex parte presentation to the FCC in which 
it  suggested  a  pilot  project  designed  to  accelerate  the  deployment  of  broadband  to 
rural  America.  It  would  provide  funding  on  a  technology  neutral  basis  while  long 
term reform of the Federal Universal Service Fund is being debated. Additional in-
formation regarding the pilot project is being submitted to the Committee for inclu-
sion into the record. 
Long Term 

If  all  of  the  collaborative  efforts  planned  for  the  state  come  to  fruition  and 
broadband  becomes  a  reality  in  all  parts  of  rural  Arkansas,  what  we  will  have  is 
a  beginning—an  important  beginning.  It  will  be  a  first  step;  but,  the  reason  you 
take  a  first  step  is  so  you  can  take  additional  steps.  We  must  not  lose  sight  of  the 
long term needs of Arkansans. More bandwidth and more availability is inextricably 
tied to Arkansas’ ability to compete for economic development, jobs, educational op-
portunities and a quality of life that Arkansans deserve.

Commissioner  ADELSTEIN.  I  know  that  AT&T’s  making  a  lot  of 
efforts  nationwide  to  upgrade  your  infrastructure  to  be  able  to 
carry  video  to  provide  some  badly-needed  competition  to  cable,  I 
wonder how is that going here in Arkansas for AT&T? 

Mr. ALLIS. We are—Commissioner Adelstein, we have made a lot 
of  progress  in  securing  agreements  with  individual  cities  and  mu-
nicipalities.  Deployment  of  the  U-verse  technology  and  the  provi-
sion  of  the  service,  we  are  still  a  number  of  months  away  from 
that, but I think next year you’ll see it take off. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. Mr. Waits? 

STATEMENT OF R. PAUL WAITS, PRESIDENT, 

RITTER COMMUNICATIONS 

Mr. WAITS. My name is Paul Waits, the president of Ritter Com-
munications  out  of  Jonesboro,  Arkansas.  We  must  be  a  relatively 
newcomer to the state compared to Ed here. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  WAITS.  We’ve  only  been  in  the  telephone  business  here  101 
years.  The  world  is  flat,  and  it’s  getting  flatter.  The  Internet  has 
indeed  leveled  the  field  of  play,  if  one  is  connected  to  that  field. 
And I think that has been the point that has been reiterated across 
the  panel  so  far.  If  you’re  a  wireline  company  like  us,  broadband 
is your future. It is the business we are in, and we must be totally 
committed  to.  We  totally  agree,  too,  that  there  is  a  linkage  that’s 
growing  stronger  between  broadband  access  to  the  public  Internet 
and  economic  health,  as  well  as  vitality  across  all  spectrums  of 
human  interaction,  collaboration,  education,  medical  care,  govern-
mental  services,  creative  endeavors,  as  well  as  business  commu-
nications. 

We,  too,  appreciate  the  fact  that  you  are  here  having  this  hear-
ing,  a  step  toward  necessary  and  lucid  assessment  of  availability 
and need. We agree with the comments to expand the definition of 
dial tone, a basic service, to include broadband access, to create an 
expanded focus for the universal service fund, but one that targets 
high-cost  areas,  based  on  the  cost  to  serve  those  areas.  We  also 
would  encourage  the  Commission  if  it  does  so,  to  recognize  an 
evolving definition of broadband. 

Prognosticators  in  our  industry  predict  that  by  2012,  broadband 
would  be  defined  as  100  megabits  per  second,  not  200  kilobits  per 
second.  The  big  driver  behind  that,  of  course,  is  video  and  the 
emerging forms of communication and collaboration that are evolv-
ing at a very rapid pace. Our company serves some very, very rural 
areas of the state, some throbbing metropolises like Jasper, Osage, 
Alpena, Western Grove, the mountainous area. We also serve some 
very  depressed  areas  in  the  state  in  the  East  of  I–55,  as  they  say. 
Our  coverage  though  is  pretty  strong.  Ninety  percent  of  our  very 
rural residents have access to broadband. Ninety-eight percent are 
incumbent  telephone  company  customers  that  have  access  to 
broadband.  A  hundred  percent  of  our  cable  customers  have  access 
to broadband. We are as large in cable TV as we are in incumbent 
telephone services. We also have CLEC. 

And  we  also  share  in  wireless  partnerships  with  Alltel.  That 
makes  us  a  bit  bipolar  when  we  consider  what  our  position  is  on 
some issues.

61 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  WAITS.  Alltel  solved  their  problem.  They  divested  part  of  it. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr.  WAITS.  We  don’t  have  such  a  luxury.  We  still  have  to  weigh 
these  issues  internally.  And  I  guess  the  parting  words  we  have  in 
that regard, to try to keep my comments brief, is that as we weigh 
those  issues  internally,  we  discover  that  if  we  look  beyond  the  pe-
cuniary  interests,  and  look  at  the  customers  and  what’s  in  their 
long-term  interests,  the  different  segments  of  customers,  they  pro-
vide  a  pretty  good  guide  to  us  as  for  what’s  in  our  long-term  busi-
ness interests. So that would be our best advice to policymakers to 
look  beyond  pecuniary  interests  and  the  short-term  shrill  needs  of 
publicly-traded  stockholders,  and  look  to  the  long-term  needs,  as-
sessed lucidly, of their customers. Thank you. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Waits follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF R. PAUL WAITS, PRESIDENT, RITTER COMMUNICATIONS 

Introduction 

My  name  is  Paul  Waits.  I  am  President  of  Ritter  Communications,  based  in 
Jonesboro, Arkansas, and I manage a company that provides a wide variety of com-
munications  services  across  Northeast  and  North  Central  Arkansas.  On  behalf  of 
our  company  and  our  communities,  we  welcome  Commissioners  Adelstein  and 
Copps, and are encouraged by the interest this hearing reflects regarding the future 
of broadband services in Arkansas. 
Ritter Communications 

Last  year,  Ritter  Communications  celebrated  its  100-year  anniversary  as  a  tele-
phone company, having its roots in providing basic telephone service in Poinsett and 
Mississippi  Counties.  Since  that  time,  the  company  has  grown  and  diversified,  and 
presently  owns  and  operates  other  incumbent  telephone  operations  in  Boone  and 
Newton  Counties,  cable  TV  franchises  across  Northeast  and  North  Central  Arkan-
sas,  competitive  communications  and  business  integration  services  in  Jonesboro,  as 
well  as  a  number  of  wireless  partnerships  with  Alltel.  All  of  these  varied  business 
interests  are  sufficient  in  scale  to  cause  us  to  weigh  among  and  balance  competing 
interests  internal  to  our  company,  e.g.,  cable  versus  telephone,  wireless  versus 
wireline,  in  formulating  and  advocating  positions  on  policy  issues.  We  think  this 
puts us in a unique position to offer observations and recommendations that balance 
such disparate interests. 

In  the  context  of  the  current  availability  and  future  of  broadband  services,  our 
greatest  concern  is  the  needs  of  the  most  rural  areas  we  serve,  specifically  the 
sparsely-populated areas of Newton and Boone Counties, and the rural agricultural 
communities of Northeast Arkansas. Some of these areas present extraordinary eco-
nomic  challenges  related  directly  to  the  cost  of  deployment,  as  well  as  the  general 
level  of  computer  literacy  and  ownership.  We  estimate  that  we  have  the  capability 
to  provide  high-speed  Internet  access  services  to  about  90  percent  of  our  telephone 
company customers in the mountainous areas of North Central Arkansas, and about 
98 percent of our telephone company subscribers in Northeast Arkansas. All central 
offices and remote terminals are equipped with DSL technology, but distance limits 
of  DSL  prevent  availability  to  the  most  remote  customers.  In  our  cable  TV  areas, 
we  can  provide  high-speed  Internet  access  to  virtually  100  percent  of  the  homes 
passed  in  these  hybrid  fiber-coax  systems.  The  percentage  is  greater  for  cable  be-
cause such systems typically do not extend to areas with low subscriber density. 
Universal Broadband Service 

As  a  nation,  we  have  virtually  achieved  universal  telephone  service  as  a  direct 
result  of  the  long-standing  public  policy  of  promoting  universal  telephone  service 
through  implicit  and  explicit  rate  averaging  across  the  country.  Governmental  pro-
grams  such  as  the  Federal  Universal  Service  Fund  (Fund)  have  been  instrumental 
in supporting the investment required for rural telephone services, and such is still 
needed for many areas too sparsely populated to economically justify either wireline 
or wireless coverage. To get a first-hand view of the rural needs and challenges, we 
invite  and  would  welcome  members  of  the  Committee  to  tour  our  rural  service 
areas.

Today, high-speed Internet access is fast becoming indispensable to basic commu-
nications  and  commerce,  just  as  the  telephone  has  been  for  many  decades.  This  is 
true  across  all  spectrums  of  human  interaction,  including  education,  medical  care, 
governmental services, creative endeavors, as well as business communications and 
collaboration.  We  believe  the  FCC  and  Congress  must  take  the  first  step  to  affirm 
a new, expanded policy of universal service, one that defines basic service to include 
broadband access to the public Internet. 

In doing so, we must be careful not to legislate an Internet access speed, i.e., not 
to cast in bureaucratic stone the definition of what we mean as broadband. Instead, 
we should allow the definition of broadband to evolve as technology and its applica-
tion evolves. Internet video applications that are emerging at a rapid pace will fuel 
consumer demand for faster connections, just as distributed computing and software 
hosting  will  drive  demand  for  faster,  more  reliable  connections  for  businesses  large 
and small. 

In  recent  years,  Ritter  Communications  has  been  deploying  fiber-to-the-premise 
services  to  the  medical  community  in  Jonesboro,  in  direct  response  to  demand  for 
very high bandwidth to support video applications used for remote diagnostics. The 
gigabit-per-second  level  bandwidth  required  could  only  be  provided  today  by  direct 
fiber connections, since wireless and other wireline technologies lack this ability. We 
believe this trend will continue and extend to other business applications and activi-
ties,  and  there  will  be  a  diverging  standard  that  will  emerge  between  mobile  and 
fixed technologies in recognition of the limitations of mobile technologies to support 
high-definition video applications. 
Funding 

We  believe  that  current  Federal  funding  for  universal  service  is  in  jeopardy,  and 
warrants  reformation  to  ensure  sustainable  and  predictable  support  for  rural  com-
munications  services,  which  is  rendered  more  imperative  by  the  need  to  expand 
such funding for broadband access services. The amount of funding for rural support 
is  eroding  as  the  base  for  such  support  is  attriting  because  of  the  transition,  iron-
ically,  to  Internet-based  telephony,  which  does  not  collect  universal  service  fund 
fees. Support for rural carriers is also adversely affected by the transition of teleph-
ony  minutes  and  access  services  from  wireline  to  wireless  services,  which  do  not 
contribute  support  in  the  form  of  carrier  access  charges.  It  is  imperative  that  the 
FCC  focus  on  these  issues  to  ensure  that  rates  and  services  are,  in  the  words  of 
the  Telecom  Reform  Act  of  1996,  ‘‘reasonably  comparable  between  urban  and  rural 
areas of the Nation.’’ 

We consider it unfortunate that the Federal universal service program has become 
a  political  target  because  of  some  confusion  regarding  its  purpose,  e.g.,  whether  its 
mission is to promote rural competition, and/or to provide for comparable rural serv-
ices  and  rates  in  high  cost  areas.  These  twin  goals  are  now  at  odds.  The  fund  has 
grown in scale and scope to the point that there is a growing concern that it should 
be better targeted to the needs of the rural public. We share this concern. This will 
be  particularly  true  if  the  fund  is  transitioned  to  promote  and  support  the  funding 
of  rural  broadband  services.  In  this  context,  we  believe  the  identical  support  rule, 
allowing  competitive  carriers  to  receive  support  based  on  the  incumbent  carrier’s 
costs, has created some burdens on the fund, with questionable benefits for the pub-
lic.  Although  some  of  Ritter  Communications’  business  interests  benefit  from  this 
rule, we are concerned about the long-term sustainability of the Fund, and the con-
tinued viability of the most rural areas of the State of Arkansas. We believe a better 
long-term  policy  is  to  continue  to  target  high  cost  areas,  with  funding  solutions 
based on each provider’s actual costs to serve those areas. 
Conclusion 

We  are  indeed  encouraged  by  the  interest  this  hearing  represents,  and  share  a 
concern regarding the need for a proactive policy on the assessment and support of 
broadband  services,  especially  in  the  most  rural  areas  of  the  state.  As  a  company 
actively engaged in providing broadband services in a wide variety of locales, using 
a  variety  of  technologies,  to  a  broad  mix  of  customers  and  customer  types,  we  be-
lieve we have some unique perspectives to offer to this conversation. 

We respectfully recommend that Federal policy first be augmented to redefine and 
expand  basic  service  to  include  broadband  access  services.  In  the  pursuit  of  this 
goal, such policy should provide for an evolving definition of broadband access serv-
ices,  and  that  policy’s  primary  focus  should  be  to  ensure,  at  a  minimum,  that  the 
most rural, high-cost areas of the state are not left out of the digital age. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. Ms. Cunningham?

STATEMENT OF MARYCE CUNNINGHAM, SECRETARY, 

ARKANSAS BROADBAND ADVISORY COUNCIL; 

GOVERNMENT RELATIONS MANAGER, MIDSOUTH REGION, 

SUDDENLINK COMMUNICATIONS 

Ms.  CUNNINGHAM.  Thank  you,  Senator.  My  name  is  Maryce 
Cunningham. I am the Secretary of the Arkansas Broadband Advi-
sory  Council  and  the  Government  Affairs  Manager  for  the 
MidSouth  Region  of  Suddenlink  Communications.  Our  276  Arkan-
sas employees take great pride in offering broadband and other ad-
vanced  services  to  secondary  markets  in  rural  communities  in  Ar-
kansas  from  the  size  of  Jonesboro  to  College  City  with  fewer  than 
300 residents. 

However, despite our best efforts to take broadband to the state’s 
smallest  communities,  we  know  there  are  still  some  areas  with  no 
broadband  service,  and  these  typically  have  only  a  few  dozen  resi-
dents  and  very  low  population  densities.  To  take  broadband  to 
them, several things need to be done. In our extended testimony for 
the  record,  Suddenlink  suggests  four  steps  for  your  consideration. 
In our limited time today, I’ll address two of those. 

The first step is to develop a comprehensive map, which has been 
mentioned  so  many  times  today,  where  broadband  service  is  avail-
able  in  Arkansas  and  where  it  is  not.  As  Senator  Pryor  knows, 
Congress  is  considering  a  national  broadband  mapping  bill.  Mean-
while,  in  West  Virginia  the  state  government  is  marshaling  re-
sources  to  produce  a  detailed  map  of  the  availability  of  broadband 
there.  We  believe  such  an  effort  is  likewise  critical  in  Arkansas  so 
that any future resources devoted to the issue here can be produc-
tively focused. 

The  second  step  is  to  make  sure  that  private  enterprises  which 
have  already  worked  hard  to  take  broadband  to  rural  Arkansas, 
have  a  fair  and  level  playing  field  to  continue  their  efforts.  Our 
companies market power is dwarfed by certain entities with which 
we are required to negotiate. 

In  that  environment,  the  electrical  cooperatives  are  threatening 
to  charge  exorbitant  pole  rental  fees,  while  large  media  conglom-
erates  are  threatening  excessive  retransmission  consent  fees.  And 
if  realized,  these  threats  will  divert  funds  that  could  otherwise  be 
used  for  additional  broadband  deployments.  Accordingly,  we  and 
others  recommend  policies  that  inject  public  interest  goals  like  the 
extension  of  broadband  to  rural  areas  into  these  market  processes 
like  retransmission  consent,  and  pole  attachment  negotiations.  Es-
pecially  where  these  negotiations  are  controlled  by  powerful  enti-
ties with economic interests that may frustrate or hinder the public 
interest. 

Again, I offer more detail on these and other steps in the written 
testimony  that  we  provided  for  the  record.  And  in  the  interest  of 
time,  I’ll  conclude  my  remarks  by  expressing  our  gratitude  to  Sen-
ator  Pryor  and  his  staff,  to  Commissioners  Copps  and  Adelstein 
and  their  staffs.  And  thank  you  for  being  here,  and  allowing  us  to 
participate in this hearing today.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARYCE CUNNINGHAM, SECRETARY, ARKANSAS BROADBAND 
ADVISORY COUNCIL AND GOVERNMENT RELATIONS MANAGER,  MIDSOUTH REGION, 
SUDDENLINK COMMUNICATIONS 
Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  My  name  is  Maryce  Cunningham.  I’m  both  the  Sec-
retary  of  the  Arkansas  Broadband  Advisory  Council  and  the  Government  Relations 
Manager  for  the  MidSouth  Region  of  Suddenlink  Communications.  This  region  of 
our company includes the state of Arkansas, of which I’m delighted to be a resident, 
along with 275 of my Suddenlink colleagues. 

Suddenlink is a top 10 U.S. operator of cable broadband systems. We support the 
information,  communication,  and  entertainment  needs  of  approximately  1.4  million 
total customers across the country, roughly 9 percent of which are in Arkansas. 

Here, as elsewhere, our employees take great pride in serving secondary markets 
and  rural  communities.  We  are  equally  proud  that,  in  a  growing  number  of  those 
communities,  we  offer  advanced  services  that  are  comparable  to  what  you  would 
find in the largest metropolitan areas, such as digital TV, competitive phone service, 
and of course, high-speed Internet or broadband service. 

In fact, Suddenlink’s story is the story of how private enterprise has already done 
a  great  deal  to  close  much  of  the  digital  divide  that  separates  smaller  communities 
from urban centers. 

In  early  2003,  our  management  team  took  over  the  operation  of  what  was  then 
known as Classic Communications. At the time, roughly 30 percent of the company’s 
customers had access to broadband service. By 2005, we had more than doubled that 
percentage.  And  today,  we  are  at  99  percent,  rapidly  moving  to  100  percent,  cov-
ering  markets  all  the  way  from  Jonesboro  with  60,000  residents  to  College  City  in 
Lawrence County, with a population of fewer than 300 people. 

All told, counting our past and current operations in Arkansas, we and our prede-
cessors  have  invested  nearly  $225  million  in  this  state  since  2003,  to  help  take 
broadband to areas where it previously was not. 

And  we’re  not  finished  yet:  Even  as  I  speak,  we’re  rolling  out  lightning-fast  con-
nections  to  mid-size  and  smaller  markets  alike,  offering  download  speeds  of  up  10 
megabits  per  second  (Mbps).  Until  now,  those  speeds  were  unheard  of  outside  the 
largest metro areas. 

As  demonstrated  by  this  list  of  accomplishments,  our  collective  effort  to  bring 
broadband  to  Rural  America  is  indeed  a  success  story  of  the  first  degree,  for  both 
our company and our industry. However, we recognize that—as much as our indus-
try  has  already  done  to  connect  Rural  Arkansas—there  are  areas  of  the  state  that 
still do not have broadband access. 

Furthermore,  it  is  our  impression,  based  on  our  experience  in  serving  secondary 
and  rural  markets,  that  the  remaining,  unconnected  areas  of  the  state—by  and 
large—do not have populations of several thousand or even several hundred people. 
To  the  contrary:  Today’s  unconnected  communities  typically  have  only  a  few  dozen 
people  living  in  them,  with  population  densities  that  are  often  10  homes  per  mile 
or less. 

To reach those areas, we believe several things need to be done. 
The first and most important step is to develop a comprehensive map of precisely 
where  broadband  service  is  available  in  Arkansas  and  where  it  is  not.  We  under-
stand the data maintained by the FCC only looks at zip codes and that it designates 
a  zip  code  as  ‘‘served,’’  even  if  only  one  home  in  that  zip  code  has  broadband  avail-
able  to  it.  Unfortunately,  in  geographically  large  and  sparsely  populated  zip  codes, 
such data is not useful. 

Accordingly,  as  Senator  Pryor  knows,  Congress  is  considering  a  national 
broadband  mapping  bill,  which  was  recently  passed  out  of  the  Senate  Commerce 
Committee. Meanwhile, in West Virginia—home to Senator Pryor’s senior colleague 
on the Commerce Committee, Senator Rockefeller; and also home to more than 600 
Suddenlink employees and more than 200,000 Suddenlink customers—the state gov-
ernment  is  currently  marshalling  resources  to  produce  a  detailed  map  of  the  avail-
ability of broadband there. 

In  short,  mapping  efforts  have  both  precedent  and  momentum,  and  we  believe 
such  an  effort  is  critical  in  Arkansas,  so  that  any  future  resources  devoted  to  the 
issue here can be most productively targeted. 

We further believe such mapping efforts should help determine home-PC penetra-
tion  in  rural  areas,  in  addition  to  the  availability  of  broadband  services.  Current 
data  suggest  that  PC  penetration  is  often  quite  low  in  rural  and  economically  de-
pressed  areas  and  thus  broader-scale  efforts  may  be  needed  to  help  lower-income 
families secure a home computer before broadband service is relevant to them. 

After broadband mapping, we believe the second critical step is to make sure pri-
vate  enterprises  like  our  company—which  have  already  done  much  to  take 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:23 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75776.TXT JACKIE

broadband  service  to  Rural  Arkansas—have  a  fair  and  level  playing  field  on  which 
to continue our efforts. 

Despite  Suddenlink’s  rank  among  the  top  10  U.S.  cable  operators,  we  remain  a 
relatively small company and our market power is dwarfed by several entities with 
which  we  are  required  to  negotiate  contracts,  including  electric  cooperatives  and 
media conglomerates. 

Without  government  intervention,  the  electric  cooperatives  have  made  it  very 
clear  they  will  charge  exorbitant  pole-rental  fees,  tripling  if  not  quadrupling  our 
costs.  The  result:  Our  company  and  others  will  have  less  capital  to  deploy 
broadband to remote areas. 

On  a  similar  note,  without  government  intervention,  large  media  conglomerates 
have made it clear they will continue to seek excessive retransmission-consent fees, 
likewise diverting funds that could otherwise be used for broadband deployment. 

At  our  current  size,  Suddenlink  does  not  have  the  negotiating  leverage  to  resist 

those threats and the resulting diversion of precious resources. 

In short, we need the careful application of government programs that inject pub-
lic-interest  goals,  like  extension  of  broadband  to  rural  areas,  into  market  processes 
like  retransmission-consent  and  pole-attachment  negotiations.  That  is  especially 
true  when  these  negotiations  are  effectively  controlled  by  large,  powerful  entities 
with clear economic interests that will frustrate or hinder the public interest by sig-
nificantly driving up the costs of broadband providers as they seek to extend service 
into areas of low-population density. 

The  third  step  in  the  process  is  to  carefully  review  technology  alternatives.  For 
instance,  ours  is  primarily  a  wireline  business,  but  we  recognize  that  wireline 
broadband  will  not  always  be  the  most  economical  option  for  reaching  the  most  re-
mote and rural areas. Instead, wireless broadband (over licensed spectrum) may ul-
timately  represent  the  best  combination  of  reliability  and  economics  to  reach  those 
areas. 

Fourth  and  finally,  we  believe  the  process  of  bridging  the  last  span  of  the  digital 
divide  will  involve  carefully  targeted  government  subsidies—subsidies  that  rely  on 
the aforementioned maps and analysis of alternative technologies. 

In  making  this  recommendation,  I  want  to  be  very  clear:  We  do  not  believe  sub-
sidies  should  be  granted  in  the  form  of  low-cost  loans.  At  low-population,  low-den-
sity levels, it’s all-but-impossible for a broadband company to develop a viable busi-
ness plan, even with the most favorable loan terms. 

That’s  a  lesson  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture’s  Rural  Utilities  Service  (or 
RUS)  has  learned  the  hard  way.  Directed  by  Congress  to  prioritize  low-cost 
broadband  loans  to  companies  that  propose  extending  service  to  un-served  areas, 
the RUS has received very few loan applications from those areas. 

Why? Because the loan applicants, even on preferential, cost-of-money terms, can-
not develop a viable business model that would allow them to pay back the money. 
Instead,  the  RUS  has  received  and  approved  loans  to  companies  that  propose  to 
serve  areas  where  broadband  is  already  available,  often  from  three  or  more  incum-
bent providers, defeating the purpose of the original legislation. 

For  that  reason,  we  believe  the  process  of  closing  the  final  inches  of  the  digital 
divide will require direct government support. That said, knowing government funds 
are scarce, I want to reiterate that a broadband subsidy program should not be de-
signed  until  the  prior  steps  I’ve  discussed  (such  as  the  mapping  project)  are  under-
taken.  Only  then  can  we  ensure  that  subsidies  are  carefully  and  appropriately  tar-
geted to the few remaining areas with no service option. 

Thank  you  for  your  time,  today.  We  look  forward  to  working  with  our  peers  on 
the  Arkansas  Broadband  Advisory  Council,  Senator  Pryor  and  his  staff,  Commis-
sioners Copps and Adelstein and their respective staff, and others to carefully exam-
ine and act upon these and similar recommendations. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. Mr. Jones?

Mr. JONES. Being at this end of the table, I’m reminded by some-
thing Commissioner Adelstein told a group of us when we were de-
bating inter-carrier compensation reform with about 40 of us in the 
room, and he said: Everything about this subject has been said. It’s 
just everyone has not said it yet.

[Laughter.] 
Mr. JONES. Good morning. My name is John Jones, and I’m Vice 
President of Regulatory and Government Relations for CenturyTel. 
I appreciate the opportunity to testify today, and I think that hear-
ings  like  this  are  both  timely  and  important,  as  all  of  us  grapple 
with  advancing  technologies  and  customer  demands.  You’ll  find 
that  despite  many  commonalities  associated  with  broadband  de-
ployment,  each  state  also  has  challenges,  opportunities,  and  char-
acteristics unique to their population and geography. 

In 2000, CenturyTel purchased more than 200,000 access lines in 
Arkansas  from  what  was  then  GTE.  Since  that  time,  our  company 
has  invested  approximately  $1  billion  in  infrastructure  to  bring 
broadband  services  to  these  markets,  where  before,  they  had  very 
few  options  like  that.  Today,  we  serve  approximately  220,000  cus-
tomers,  and  82  percent  of  those  customers  have  broadband  avail-
ability. 

In  Arkansas  and  mostly  rural  markets  in  24  other  states, 
CenturyTel  is  introducing  a  variety  of  new  broadband  services  at 
speeds  up  to  ten  megabits  per  second.  We’re  delivering  those  serv-
ices  with  our  core  wireline  network  and  alternative  broadband  ac-
cess  technologies  such  as  mesh  Wi-Fi  hot  spots  and  point-to-point 
wireless  broadband  into  strategic  areas.  As  part  of  our  testimony 
today,  we  want  to  leave  you  with  three  key  points  relating  to  pro-
viding broadband to rural areas. 

Number  one,  in  rural  markets,  affordability,  lack  of  customer 
density,  and  PC  availability  are  the  biggest  obstacles  to  increased 
broadband’s subscribership. 

Number  two,  reaching  the  remaining  unserved  customers  in 
rural markets that do not have broadband today would require sig-
nificant additional investment. 

And  number  three,  efforts  by  the  Joint  Board  and  FCC  to  sta-
bilize the Universal Service Fund are critical to a long-term viabil-
ity  of  the  Fund,  and  consequently  the  goal  of  universal  broadband 
access for all. 

In  most  of  our  operating  states,  we  are  working  with  our  state 
governments  to  identify  broadband  challenges,  and  engaging  in 
public/private partnerships, such as Connected Nation and Connect 
Arkansas, to help all providers to deploy in unserved areas. We be-
lieve  customer  broadband  expectations  revolve  around  faster 
speeds,  lower  prices,  and  competitive  service  bundles.  Also,  we’ve 
seen some really great success stories out of this state in areas like 
Forks,  Washington,  that  lost  its  economy  due  to  the  timber  busi-
ness  and  reinvented  itself  with  broadband  connectivity  and  Bayou 
La  Batre,  Alabama,  which  was  cleaned  off  the  map  by  Hurricane 
Katrina, and bringing broadband to that area and how they in two 
short years have basically put themselves back on the map through 
economic development and broadband outreach. 

In closing, CenturyTel believes that rural customers are speaking 
loudly  about  what  their  telecom  needs  are.  It  is  not  necessarily 
about  wireless  or  wireline  voice  service  because,  they  have  that  in 
most  of  the  cases.  It’s  about  broadband,  affordable  broadband,  and 
faster broadband. We look forward to working with other Arkansas 
stakeholders to strengthen the link between broadband availability 
and broadband subscribership, and continue in meeting their evolv-

ing  telecom  needs  for  Arkansas  citizens.  And,  again,  I  thank  you 
so much for inviting us here today, and appreciate the opportunity. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Jones follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN F. JONES, VICE PRESIDENT, REGULATORY AND 

GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, CENTURYTEL, INC. 

Senator  Pryor  and  distinguished  guests,  my  name  is  John  Jones,  and  I  am  Vice 
President  of  Regulatory  and  Government  Relations  for  CenturyTel,  Inc.  I  submit 
this testimony as part of the above referenced proceeding, and thank you for allow-
ing our company to participate. We believe hearings of this type are both timely and 
important  as  the  industry  works  to  keep  pace  with  evolving  technologies  and  an 
ever-changing  marketplace.  You  will  find  that  despite  many  commonalities  associ-
ated  with  broadband  deployment,  each  state  also  has  challenges,  opportunities  and 
characteristics unique to their population and geographic area. 

In  2000,  CenturyTel  purchased  more  than  200,000  access  lines  in  Arkansas  from 
what  was  then  GTE.  Since  that  time,  our  company  has  invested  approximately  $1 
billion in this state and located our Southeast Regional Office in Cabot. The changes 
we  brought  to  the  former  GTE  customers  from  a  telecommunications  perspective 
were  dramatic.  In  nine  short  months,  we  intensified  efforts  and  through  a  dis-
ciplined  investment  strategy  brought  broadband  and  dial-up  Internet  services  to 
rural  markets  that  had  few  if  any  such  options.  Today,  CenturyTel  serves  approxi-
mately 220,000 customers in the State of Arkansas, with more than 82 percent hav-
ing access to DSL services. 

In Arkansas and in various rural markets in 24 states, CenturyTel is introducing 
new services such as broadband TV, personalized broadband content and broadband 
access  speeds  up  to  10  Mbps.  In  addition,  we  are  deploying  alternative  broadband 
access  technologies  such  as  mesh  Wi-Fi  ‘‘hot  spots’’  or  ‘‘hot  zones’’  and  ‘‘point-to- 
point’’ wireless broadband in strategic areas. 

As part of our testimony today, we want to leave you with three key points relat-

ing to providing broadband in rural areas: 

1. In rural markets, affordability, a lack of customer density and PC availability 
are the biggest obstacles to increased broadband penetration; 
2.  Reaching  the  remaining  unserved  customers  in  rural  markets  that  do  not 
have  broadband  today  will  require  significant  investment  and  cost,  with  few,  if 
any, business cases to support that investment; and 
3.  Efforts  by  the  Joint  Board  and  FCC  to  stabilize  the  universal  service  fund 
are  critical  to  the  long-term  vitality  of  the  fund  and,  consequently,  the  goal  of 
universal  broadband  access  for  all  Americans.  Americans  in  all  parts  of  the 
country  are  sending  the  message  that  their  telecom  and  economic  future  de-
pends  on  robust  broadband  deployment.  In  the  years  ahead,  global  economic 
competition  will  require  increasingly  sophisticated  networks  that  deliver  un-
precedented  levels  of  speed  at  much  lower  costs.  Reform  of  USF  must  account 
for this central public policy goal. 

In most of our operating states, we are seeing an increasing interest in ‘‘last mile’’ 
broadband  solutions.  Like  other  providers,  we  are  working  with  our  state  govern-
ments to identify broadband challenges and engaging in public-private partnerships, 
such  as  Connected  Nation  and  Connect  Arkansas,  to  help  all  providers  deploy  in 
unserved  areas.  We  believe  customer  broadband  expectations  revolve  around  faster 
speeds,  lower  prices  and  competitive  service  bundles.  It  is  our  view  that  with  the 
doubling  of  Internet  traffic  every  year,  capacity  and  speed  will  be  the  key 
differentiators  as  the  high-speed  data  market  continues  to  evolve  and  be  driven  by 
customer demand. 

As you know, broadband connections and the services they deliver will be the core 
strategic  product  for  our  future  growth.  Eventually,  all  voice,  data  and  entertain-
ment  services  will  ride  the  broadband  pipe.  Also,  from  a  consumer  acquisition  and 
retention  perspective,  broadband  is  becoming  the  consumer  linchpin  for  the  bun-
dling, pricing and marketing of other services. To that end, price and speed are be-
coming the key drivers of customer demand. 

Despite  remarkable  success  in  deploying  broadband  services  in  some  very  rural 
areas, subscribership rates in rural markets remain relatively low because of issues 
with  affordability  and  PC  availability.  The  main  point  I  want  to  make  about  this 
is that even though a customer in a rural market has broadband available to them, 
other  important  factors  will  ultimately  impact  their  decision  on  whether  to  become 
a broadband subscriber or not.

CenturyTel recognizes that deploying broadband to the remaining unserved or un-
derserved areas will be an expensive undertaking. If the Nation’s telecom policy goal 
should  become  ubiquitous  or  nearly  ubiquitous  broadband  availability,  ultimately 
some  form  of  broadband  support  will  be  needed  to  help  offset  the  cost  drivers  for 
rural service. There are several categories of costs that CenturyTel believes are not 
addressed today. 

As an example, most of the monthly recurring inter-office transport and backhaul 
costs  between  rural  local  exchange  areas  and  the  nearest  tandem  switch  or  urban 
Internet access point, which may be hundreds of miles away, are not expressly cov-
ered  by  the  Federal  high-cost  programs  today.  This  backhaul  infrastructure  is  also 
relied  upon  by  ISPs,  wireless  providers,  VoIP  providers  and  others  sending  traffic 
to or receiving traffic from rural customers. 

CenturyTel  believes  that  targeted  universal  service  funding  for  the  highest  cost 
areas will be needed in conjunction with other support mechanisms such as grants, 
tax  investment  incentives  and  low  interest  loans.  Regardless  of  the  funding  source 
established,  the  key  will  be  to  properly  define  what  is  meant  by  ‘‘broadband’’  and 
‘‘support for broadband’’ on the front end of the process. In light of the rapid techno-
logical  changes  taking  place,  the  new  definition  must  be  flexible  to  accommodate 
evolving  technology.  Therefore,  it  will  be  important  for  policymakers  to  revisit  and 
update  the  standard  periodically  in  order  to  keep  affordable  bandwidth  speeds  in 
rural areas comparable to those in urban areas. 

This  hearing  today  would  not  be  as  worthwhile  if  the  witnesses  did  not  offer  po-
tential  solutions  to  help  expand  the  availability  of  advanced  services  into  under-
served  and  unserved  areas.  CenturyTel  believes  that  a  limited,  but  clearly  defined, 
separate broadband program for unserved high-cost areas would be a good first step. 
Funding for such a program might come from the restructure of some existing USF 
elements.  For  example,  limiting  support  to  only  one  wireless  CETC  per  market 
should produce significant savings. In addition, we support the recent Federal-State 
Joint Board recommendation to place an interim cap on CETC support at 2006 lev-
els.  This  recommendation  is  a  logical  and  rational  first  step  toward  meaningful  re-
form. 

I want to leave you with a broadband success story from Mountain Home, Arkan-
sas.  Miles  and  Michelle  Riley  moved  from  Mississippi  to  Arkansas  in  1998  to  start 
a  small  family  business  offering  guided  hunting,  fishing  and  nature  trips  on  the 
White  and  Buffalo  Rivers  to  customers  from  around  the  Nation.  CenturyTel  in-
stalled  high-speed  Internet  at  the  Riley’s  remote  location  shortly  before  Memorial 
Day  in  2005.  Since  that  time,  the  Rileys  have  basically  remained  booked  solid  and 
can  offer  their  customers  the  ability  to  book  their  guided  outings  via  the  Internet 
and  check  their  e-mail  and  stay  connected  to  their  business  via  a  wireless  router. 
The  Rileys  maintain  they  could  not  maintain  their  business  at  the  level  they  do 
without  the  broadband  connection.  This  is  just  one  example  of  the  tremendous  eco-
nomic impact broadband can bring to rural America. 

In  closing,  CenturyTel  believes  that  rural  consumers  are  speaking  loudly  about 
what  their  telecom  needs  are.  It  is  not  about  wireless  or  wireline  voice  service  be-
cause they have that in most cases. It is about broadband, more broadband and fast-
er broadband. In the years ahead, global economic competition will require increas-
ingly  sophisticated  networks  that  deliver  unprecedented  levels  of  speed  at  much 
lower costs. 

We  look  forward  to  working  with  other  stakeholders  to  strengthen  the  link  be-
tween broadband availability and subscribership and continue meeting the evolving 
telecommunications needs of Arkansas citizens. 

Again, thank you Senator Pryor for giving us the opportunity to provide input on 

such an important public policy. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. Mr. Ashcraft?

Mr. ASHCRAFT. Senator and Commissioners, thank you for bring-

for  the  opportunity  to  speak  before  the  Committee.  My  name  is 
Greg Ashcraft. I am CFO for South Arkansas Telephone Company. 
South Arkansas Telephone Company is a rural incumbent local ex-
change  carrier  in  south  Arkansas  with  3,900  customers.  I’m  here

other rural independent telephone companies. These companies un-
derstand  the  importance  of  broadband  to  the  medical,  educational, 
social,  and  economical  needs  of  Arkansans  and  Americans.  These 
companies  have  been  working  very  hard  on  the  deployment  of 
broadband  in  their  service  areas.  The  following  percentages  are  a 
year old, but it is evidence of their hard work. 

Broadband is available in a hundred percent of the exchanges of 
these rural ILECs. Broadband is available to 82 percent of the cus-
tomers  of  the  rural  ILECs.  And  11  percent  of  the  customers  had 
subscribed to broadband as of a year ago. This level of deployment 
of broadband has been accomplished due to the dependability, reli-
ability  of  the  revenue  stream  from  the  Universal  Service  Funds 
and NECA pools. We feel it’s important to protect these pools to en-
sure  the  availability  of  broadband  to  the  rural  systems  in  the  fu-
ture.  This  deployment  has  also  been  to  some  of  the  most  remote 
and most rural areas of the state of Arkansas. 

For  instance,  South  Arkansas  Telephone  Company  has  two  sub-
scribers  per  route  mile  of  cable,  and  the  other  14  companies  have 
similar  statistics.  These  companies  are  working  hard  in  deploying 
broadband to the remaining 18 percent of the customers. The prob-
lem is this last deployment will be the most difficult to accomplish 
and  the  most  expensive.  These  companies  are  dedicated  to  making 
broadband available to 100 percent of their customers. 

So  in  closing,  the  rural  telephone  companies  of  Arkansas  feel 
we’ve  made  great  steps  in  the  deployment  of  broadband,  but  there 
is still work to do. And the last deployment will be the most expen-
sive, most difficult. This is one of the main reasons why we are just 
as  committed  to  help  stabilize  the  USF,  to  continue  to  support 
broadband through the USF, and to help protect the long-term via-
bility of the USF. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GREG ASHCRAFT, CFO, 

SOUTH ARKANSAS TELEPHONE COMPANY 

Hello,  my  name  is  Greg  Ashcraft  and  I  am  the  CFO  for  South  Arkansas  Tele-
phone Company and a member of the Arkansas Broadband Advisory Council. South 
Arkansas  Telephone  Company  is  a  small  incumbent  local  exchange  carrier  (ILEC) 
in  south  Arkansas  with  3,900  customers.  I  am  here  today  representing  South  Ar-
kansas  Telephone  Company  and  14  other  small  independents  that  are  not  rep-
resented  on  this  panel.  I  work  closely  with  these  14  companies  on  policy  develop-
ment. 

The  small  rural  Arkansas  telephone  companies  understand  the  importance  of 
Broadband  to  the  medical,  educational,  social  and  economic  needs  for  rural  Arkan-
sans and Americans. 

The  small  telephone  companies  in  Arkansas  have  worked  very  hard  in  recent 
years  to  deploy  broadband  to  their  customers.  Evidence  of  our  work  is  included  in 
this data that is over a year old: 

nies. 

• Broadband service is available in 100 percent of the exchanges of these compa-
• Broadband had been made available to 82 percent of the total customers of the 
• Approximately  11  percent  of  the  customers  of  the  rural  ILECs  had  subscribed 

rural ILECs. 

to broadband. 

The  cost  of  service  is  reasonable  and  the  companies  are  working  hard  to  finish 
providing  broadband  to  the  remaining  18  percent  that  they  had  not  reached  a  year 
ago and to encourage more households to subscribe to broadband service. 

The benefit of ILEC broadband service includes:

• the historical reliability of service. 
• the  community  based  owners  and  the  adherence  of  these  companies  of  public 
service  commission  customer  service  rules  that  protect  customers  and  allow  a 
supervised complaint process in event of dispute. 

The  broadband  available  through  these  small  companies  is  backed-up  by  power 
generators and by engineered lines that are programmed to allow alternate facilities 
to be used to maintain service, in the event of any disaster or attack. 

The  broadband  deployment  in  these  rural  companies  should  be  understood  as 
service  to  some  of  the  most  rural  areas  of  Arkansas.  For  instance  South  Arkansas 
Telephone Company has 2 customers per route mile of cable and many of the other 
14 companies have similar statistics. The 82 percent availability of broadband is not 
because of population density, but in spite of population density. This wire-line serv-
ice has been provided to these rural customers with the reasonable reliability of rev-
enue  streams,  such  as  the  Federal  Universal  Service  and  NECA  pools.  These  serv-
ices  will  continue  to  be  provided  on  a  fair,  reasonable,  affordable  and  community 
basis in the coming years. One of the problems is that making broadband available 
to  the  remaining  18  percent  of  these  companies  customer  base  will  be  the  most  ex-
pensive  deployment;  however  the  rural  ILECs  are  dedicated  to  providing  100  per-
cent deployment. 

The rural companies are leaders in deploying broadband to rural areas due to the 
reliability  and  dependability  of  Federal  Universal  Service  and  NECA  pools  in  the 
past.  It  is  important  that  these  pools  be  protected  to  ensure  continued  availability 
of broadband to the rural citizens in the future. 

We would urge this Committee to join the efforts of the rural telephone companies 
in  Arkansas,  and  the  efforts  of  the  Joint  Board  and  the  FCC,  to  stabilize  the  USF, 
continue to support broadband in the USF and protect the long-term viability of the 
USF. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. Mr. Pitcock? 

STATEMENT OF LEN PITCOCK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 

ARKANSAS CABLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION 
Mr.  PITCOCK.  Thank  you,  Senator.  And  welcome  again  on  behalf 
of all of us. I’m Len Pitcock, the Executive Director of the Arkansas 
Cable  Telecommunications  Association.  We’re  headquartered  here 
in  Little  Rock,  and  we  represent  about  a  dozen  of  the  state’s 
broadband and cable providers. Our membership ranges from some 
of the countries largest multi-system operators serving our state to 
some  of  the  smaller  family-owned  companies  with  a  few  hundred 
subscribers.  We  also  have  two  municipally-owned  cable  operators 
in our membership. Broadband deployment in Arkansas has played 
a pivotal role in the growth of our industry over the past ten years. 
Our membership has connected Arkansans to the rest of the world 
through  private  investments  we’ve  made  in  our  businesses.  From 
the  fastest  growing  metropolitan  areas  of  our  state  in  the  north-
west to central Arkansas to the smallest communities in the Delta, 
many Arkansans are taking full advantage of the technology avail-
able to them today. 

Haynes,  Arkansas,  is  a  prime  example  of  the  Arkansas  cable  in-
dustries  commitment  to  rural  broadband  deployment.  This  small 
Delta  farming  community  of  187  residents  is  miles  from  the  near-
est population base. Yet cable’s investment in the area has resulted 
in 18 high-speed Internet customers. That’s ten percent of the com-
munity, and I think that’s up for debate whether or not ten percent 
of  the  community  is  a  good  thing  or  a  bad  thing.  The  broadband 
investment  in  Haynes  like  almost  all  across  the  state  was  made 
with no government assistance whatsoever. 

As I am sure many of you have heard before, the cable industry, 
it takes great pride to think that we have collectively invested over 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:23 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75776.TXT JACKIE

$100  billion  in  private  capital  deploying  broadband  across  this 
country in recent years. Here in Arkansas, we’ve easily spent a half 
billion  dollars  in  that  same  time  period.  These  expenditures  result 
in jobs, tax revenues, and many other economic factors contributing 
to our state’s financial well-being. 

This is not to say we’re done, however. One Arkansas community 
without  access  to  broadband  is  one  too  many.  The  cable  industry 
is not and never has been opposed to government incentives for the 
deployment of broadband. In many cases, we recognize policy meas-
ures  are  the  only  avenue  available  to  further  deploy  broadband  to 
portions  of  the  state  that  might  not  realize  it  any  other  way.  Our 
position  has  been  and  remains  today  that  government  assistance 
should  be  closely  monitored  and  should  only  be  available  to  areas 
where  no  service  exists.  Government-subsidized  competition  occurs 
when  incentives  are  available  to  providers  to  deploy  broadband  in 
areas that already have it. This is our fear—the availability of tax 
breaks, low interest loans, and other economic benefits provided by 
the government for others to enter the market where we’ve already 
made private investment, we and others have made private invest-
ment. 

Broadband  deployment  in  Arkansas  is  important.  We—the  cable 
industry—recognize  that  we  are  one  of  the  leading  providers  of 
broadband  in  the  state  and  we  take  our  role  very  seriously.  We 
were there on the front end, and we will continue to assist Arkan-
sans  in  our  collective,  and  when  I  say  collective,  all  of  us  in  this 
room are collective efforts to be a member of the global community. 
This concludes my testimony.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LEN PITCOCK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 

ARKANSAS CABLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION 

I’m  Len  Pitcock,  Executive  Director  of  the  Arkansas  Cable  Telecommunications 
Association.  We  are  an  industry  organization  comprised  of  a  dozen  cable  and 
broadband  operators  here  in  the  state.  Our  membership  ranges  from  several  of  the 
country’s largest multi-system operators, to smaller family-owned companies with a 
few  hundred  customers.  The  Association  also  has  two  municipally-owned  cable  sys-
tems included in its membership. 

Broadband deployment in Arkansas has played a pivotal role in the growth of our 
industry over the past 10 years. Our membership has connected Arkansans with the 
rest  of  the  world  through  the  private  investments  we’ve  made  in  our  businesses. 
From the fastest growing metropolitan areas of our state in Northwest and Central 
Arkansas,  to  the  smallest  communities  in  the  Delta,  many  Arkansans  are  taking 
full advantage of the technology available to them today. 

Haynes,  Arkansas  is  a  prime  example  of  the  Arkansas  cable  industry’s  commit-
ment  to  rural  broadband  deployment.  This  small  Delta  farming  community  of  187 
residents  is  miles  from  the  nearest  population  base.  Yet  cable’s  investment  in  the 
area has resulted in 18 high-speed Internet customers. That’s 10 percent of the en-
tire community. 

The  broadband  investment  in  Haynes,  Arkansas,  like  almost  all  across  the  state 
was made with no government assistance whatsoever. As I’m sure many of you have 
heard  before,  the  cable  industry  takes  great  pride  in  the  fact  that  we  have  collec-
tively invested over 100 billion dollars in private capital deploying broadband across 
the  country  in  recent  years.  Arkansas  companies  have  easily  spent  over  a  half  bil-
lion  dollars.  These  expenditures  result  in  jobs,  tax  revenues  and  many  other  eco-
nomic factors contributing to our state’s financial well being. 

This is not to say we are done however. One Arkansas community without access 

to broadband services is one too many. 

The  cable  industry  is  not,  and  never  has  been,  opposed  to  government  incentives 
for the deployment of broadband. In many cases, we recognize policy measures may 
be  the  only  avenue  available  to  further  deploy  broadband  to  portions  of  the  state

that might not realize it any other way. Our position has been, and remains today, 
that government assistance should be closely monitored and available only to areas 
without  service.  Government  subsidized  competition  occurs  when  incentives  are 
available to providers to deploy broadband in areas that already have it. This is our 
fear—the  availability  of  tax  breaks,  low  interest  loans,  or  other  economic  benefits 
provided by the government for others to enter the market and compete with those 
who’ve already invested there. 

Broadband  deployment  in  Arkansas  is  important.  The  cable  industry  of  the  state 
takes  its  role  as  one  of  the  leading  providers  very  seriously.  We  were  there  on  the 
front end and will continue to assist Arkansans in our collective effort to be a mem-
ber of the global community. This concludes my testimony. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. Mr. Massaglia? 

STATEMENT OF GARY MASSAGLIA, VICE PRESIDENT AND 

GENERAL MANAGER, COMCAST CORPORATION—ARKANSAS 
Mr.  MASSAGLIA.  Thank  you,  Senator  and  Commissioners.  My 
name  is  Gary  Massaglia.  I’m  the  Vice  President  of  Operations  for 
Comcast Corporation here in Arkansas. We serve basically two geo-
graphic  areas  in  the  state:  around  the  Little  Rock  area  here  and 
in  the  West  Memphis  area  up  into  more  of  the  northeast  section 
of  the  state.  We  have  over  the  past  years  invested  about  $60  mil-
lion as Mr. Pitcock mentioned of privately-raised capital into build-
ing our broadband network, so that we can provide all of the prod-
ucts  and  services  that  our  customers  are  looking  for  in  those  two 
geographic areas. 

As we prepared that network, we have spent that money so that 
we  could  bring  not  only  all  of  our  video  products  but  also 
broadband  Internet  and  now  telephony.  We’re  doing  this  because 
there is a customer demand in the communities and neighborhoods 
that we serve. And because of this investment, all of our customers 
have  access  to  the  myriad  of  products  and  services.  Those  include 
250  all  digital  video  channels,  multiple  high  definition  channels, 
high-speed  Internet,  On  Demand  programming,  and  now  with  te-
lephony products also available facilities-based. We offer speeds on 
our high-speed Internet up to 12 Mbps today. Those are constantly 
growing,  so  the  investment  never  stops.  We  invested  that  $60  mil-
lion  as  I  mentioned,  that  continues  to  grow  because  you  have  to 
keep  up  with  the  demand  for  more  bandwidth,  not  only  from  our 
residential  customers,  but  also  from  the  business  community. 
What’s interesting to think about is just ten years ago, most Ameri-
cans  used  dial-up,  which  we’ve  heard  mentioned  by  some  of  the 
students earlier. 

Most  of  us  as  Americans  used  dial-up  Internet,  and  we  paid  ex-
pensive  per  minute  charges,  and  quite  frankly,  I  think  we  all 
thought it was pretty neat. Today, we think it’s very archaic, so it’s 
amazing how fast that technology is changing and moving forward. 
The  same  network  as  I’ve  mentioned  that  we’ve  built  allows  us  to 
offer  an  alternative  to  local  exchange  telephone  service,  delivering 
facilities-based  broadband  choice  for  telephone.  Comcast  offers  Ar-
kansas  customers  a  digital  voice  service  with  a  broad  array  of  fea-
tures and capabilities at very competitive prices. We have invested 
significantly  to  bring  facilities-based  telephone  competition  to  Ar-
kansas, and we are pleased to state that our products and services, 
digital  video,  high-speed  Internet,  and  telephone  are  available  to

100  percent  of  the  homes  that  we  pass.  That  concludes  my  testi-
mony, and I would be glad to answer any questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GARY MASSAGLIA, VICE PRESIDENT 
AND GENERAL MANAGER, COMCAST CORPORATION—ARKANSAS 

Thank you Mr. Chairman. My name is Gary Massaglia and I’m the Vice President 

and General Manager for Comcast’s cable operations in Arkansas. 

We  serve  approximately  90,000  customers  in  the  Little  Rock  and  West  Memphis 

areas of the state. 

My comments today will focus primarily on our experience in offering Broadband 

to our central Arkansas customers. 

Comcast has invested approximately $60 million dollars in private capital without 
any government incentives to prepare our network to offer our customers the variety 
of  products  and  services  made  capable  by  a  complete  Broadband  network.  This  in-
cludes  a  $6  million  dollar  state-of-the-art  technical  center  currently  being  built  in 
Little  Rock.  We’ve  done  this  because  there  is  a  customer  demand  in  the  commu-
nities and the neighborhoods we serve. 

And  because  of  this  investment,  all  of  our  customers  have  access  to  a  myriad  of 

products including: 

• Over  250  all  digital  video  channels;  multiple  High  Definition  channels  with 
plans  to  offer  many  more  as  quality  HD  channels  become  available;  over  8,000 
different On Demand programs available for our customers to choose what they 
want to watch, when they want it and start and stop the programs at their con-
venience. 
• Also, as a result of our Broadband network, Comcast customers can experience 
the  best  the  Internet  has  to  offer.  We  offer  speeds  up  to  12  Mbps  and  a  very 
video rich and easy to navigate Comcast portal. 
» What’s  interesting  to  think  about  is  that  just  over  10  years  ago,  most  Ameri-
cans  used  dial-up  access  to  the  Internet  and  paid  expensive  per  minute 
charges  for  service  and  received  what  today  would  be  considered  incredibly 
slow speed and very little content. 
• This  same  network  allows  Comcast  to  offer  an  alternative  to  local  exchange 
phone  service,  delivering  real  facilities  based  choice  to  consumers.  Comcast  of-
fers  our  Arkansas  customers  a  digital  voice  service  with  a  broad  array  of  fea-
tures and capabilities at very competitive prices. 

We  have  invested  significantly  to  bring  facilities-based  telephone  competition  to 
Arkansas  and  we  are  very  pleased  to  state  that  our  products  and  services;  digital 
video, high-speed Internet and our phone service are available to 100 percent of the 
homes we pass here in central Arkansas. Not one neighborhood is excluded. 

Thank you and I will be pleased to answer any questions. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you. Mr. Gibson? 

STATEMENT OF DEAN GIBSON, VICE PRESIDENT, 

OPERATIONS, PINNACLE COMMUNICATIONS 

Mr. GIBSON. Thank you once again, gentlemen, for coming today. 
We  appreciate  your  time  and  your  effort  in  making  it  to  our  state. 
I  just  want  to  give  you  a  perspective  this  morning  from  a  family- 
owned  telephone  business  in  Lavaca,  Arkansas.  In  Lavaca,  we  are 
a  wireline  company  that  has  been  in  business  since  1960,  and 
we’ve been providing quality, we think, telephone services to those 
customers since that time. 

We, today, service over 1,500 customers in rural western Arkan-
sas.  And  I  think  two  points  I’d  like  to  discuss  today—one  that  has 
been  covered  quite  a  bit,  the  other  one  maybe  that  has  not.  I  re-
member  years  ago  my  grandmother  would  work  a  switchboard  in 
a  home  where  she  and  my  grandfather  lived.  And  it  was  one  of 
these things that I just grew up to know. But another thing I grew 
up to know was this term ‘‘carrier of last resort.’’ And I think some-

74 

where in all of this, we’ve got to remember the fact that during the 
early days of telephone, as an incumbent local telephone company, 
we  provided  service  to  everyone  in  our  area.  No  one  was  left  out. 
Our  company,  four  years  ago,  decided  that  with  the  aging  of  our 
copper  plant  and  the  demand  of  the  services,  advanced  services 
from  the  people  in  our  community  that  we  were  going  to  deploy  a 
fiber-to-the-home  network  in  our  entire  exchange.  And  after  three 
long  years  and  more  than  165  miles  of  fiberoptic  cable  in  the 
ground,  today,  at  the  end  of  this  year,  every  customer,  all  1,500 
plus,  will  have  access  to  a  fiberoptic  network,  which  will  allow 
them  to  have  the  state-of-the-art  services  that  come,  and 
broadband  especially.  No  longer  is  dial-up  acceptable  to  people,  I 
don’t  think,  in  Arkansas  and  anywhere  else.  You  might  ask  the 
question  on  how  can  they  afford  do  that.  And  I  answer  that  ques-
tion  by  those  three  letters  we’ve  heard  over  and  over  today,  and 
that’s USF. 

The Universal Service Fund has provided, along with a NECA of 
pooling,  have  provided  us  the  ability  to  move  forward  and  make 
this commitment in this investment into Arkansas. And with that, 
we  want  to  say  as  Pinnacle  Communications,  maybe  other  rural 
companies,  that  we  applaud  the  Joint  Board’s  recommendation  to 
put a cap upon the USF until it can be reworked and it can be up-
dated  to  be  something  that  services  everyone  who  has  the  need. 
Like  I  said,  we’ve  been  servicing  customers  in  Lavaca  since  1961. 
We depend upon a lot of things to make our business go. 

One of that is service to the customer. The other thing is the fact 
that we rely upon the USF, and we want to see a long-term stable 
USF.  We  honestly  believe  that’s  a  way  to  deploy  broadband  to  the 
areas  that  are  high-cost.  And  we,  in  closing,  think  that  those  cus-
tomers  in  the  high-cost  areas  deserve  the  same  products  and  serv-
ices that those in the low-cost, urban areas deserve. And that’s our 
mission. Thank you. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gibson follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DEAN GIBSON, VICE PRESIDENT, OPERATIONS, 

PINNACLE COMMUNICATIONS 

My  name  is  Dean  Gibson  and  I  am  Vice  President  of  Operations  for  Pinnacle 
Communications  in  Lavaca,  Arkansas.  Our  company  provides  landline  voice  and 
Internet  access  to  over  1,500  customers  in  rural  western  Arkansas.  In  the  short 
time we have today, I would like to focus my comments on two points which I think 
are important to our discussion today. 

My first point is carrier of last resort. Pinnacle Communications is a carrier of last 
resort;  by  that  I  mean  as  an  incumbent  local  exchange  company  (ILEC),  Pinnacle 
Communications  is  required  to  provide  service  to  all  customers  within  its  exchange 
boundary. We have applied that policy not only to the telephone services we provide 
but  to  our  deployment  of  broadband  services.  I  guess  it  has  just  become  ‘a  way  of 
doing  business’.  If  the  person  closest  to  the  office  can  receive  the  service,  why 
shouldn’t  the  customer  fifteen  (15)  miles  out  be  able  to  receive  the  service?  That  is 
where  the  old  phrase  ‘easier  said  than  done’  comes  into  play.  About  4  years  ago, 
we  realized  that  our  aging  outside  plant  needed  to  be  upgraded  or  replaced  if  we 
were  going  to  continue  to  provide  quality,  reliable  services.  Customers  in  our  most 
rural  areas  were  demanding  faster  Internet  speeds.  Dial-up  Internet  was  no  longer 
satisfactory  to  them.  Taking  that  into  consideration  along  with  the  fact  that  Con-
gress,  the  Governor,  and  the  Arkansas  Legislature  were  all  looking  for  ways  to  get 
broadband  services  to  the  rural  customers,  we  decided  to  replace  our  copper  cable 
system  with  a  state-of-the-art  fiber  system.  It  has  been  a  long,  tough  road  but  by 
the end of this year (2007), we will have completed a ‘Fiber-to-the-Home’ rebuild of 
our Lavaca, Arkansas exchange. That means that every customer in our service area

will  be  able  to  receive  not  only  exceptional  phone  service  but  high-speed  Internet 
access.  You  may  ask,  ‘‘How  can  they  afford  to  do  that’’?  I  am  glad  you  ask  because 
that leads me to my second point. 

Our decision to make the investment in rural Arkansas, as a carrier of last resort, 
was based entirely on future NECA settlements and USF support, commitments we 
rely  upon  for  our  company’s  survival.  The  purpose  of  USF  is  to  ensure  that  Ameri-
cans  in  high  cost  rural  areas  have  communications  services  comparable  to  those  in 
low cost areas. It was never meant to subsidize competition between multiple carriers 
all  providing  the  same  service.  Pinnacle  Communications  believes  the  recommenda-
tion by the Joint Board to put a cap on the dollars distributed to competitive eligible 
telecommunications  carriers  (CETCs)  by  the  USF  represents  a  necessary  and  re-
sponsible  step  as  the  FCC  and  Congress  develop  a  long  term  solution  to  stabilize 
the  fund.  The  Joint  Board’s  recommendation  will  help  bring  run-away,  excessive 
funding  for  CETCs  under  control,  which  is  indispensable  to  modernizing  the  USF. 
And by the way, wireline companies like mine have had a cap on the growth on USF 
payments for years so we are not advocating something that we do not already have 
to abide by. 

In  closing,  our  company  wants  desperately  to  continue  to  provide  our  rural  cus-
tomers with the quality services they have been accustomed to since 1961, the year 
Pinnacle  Communications  first  borrowed  money  from  REA  to  provide  telephone 
service to areas that, up to that time, had no service. We have undertaken consider-
able  risks,  investing  in  plant  and  equipment  to  provide  broadband  to  customers  no 
one  else  wants  to  serve  because  it  doesn’t  fit  their  business  plan.  Rural  customers 
in Arkansas and across America need carriers of last resort to insure that everyone 
has  access  to  affordable  broadband  services.  Those  carriers  can  only  survive  if  we 
protect the long-term viability of the Universal Service Fund. 

Commissioner ADELSTEIN. First, I just want to commend you for 
building  a  fiber  network  out  in  rural  Arkansas.  I  think  that’s  fan-
tastic,  and  I’m  glad  to  hear  that  USF  helped  with  that.  Of  course, 
it  doesn’t  directly  support  broadband  but  we  have  a  ‘‘no  barriers’’ 
policy  that  allows  you  to  invest  in  network  that  can  carry 
broadband.  I’m  wondering,  would  it  be  helpful  to  you  if  Universal 
Service explicitly made broadband a supported service? 

Mr.  GIBSON.  Well,  I  don’t  know.  In  our  case,  we  could  see  an 
aging  telephone  network,  and  we  still  believed—because  there  are 
places  in  our  service  area,  believe  it  or  not,  that  are  not  serviced 
by  a  wireless  telephone.  And  so  not  only  were  we  allowed  to  use 
or  able  to  upgrade  broadband  into  these  rural  areas,  but  also  the 
telephony, or the telephone usage, was also upgraded and provided 
to those areas. So I honestly believe that the USF can be a mecha-
nism of which we can use to help deploy that into those areas.

STATEMENT OF KELLY HALE ZEGA, STATE MANAGER, 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS, COX COMMUNICATIONS, ARKANSAS 

Ms. ZEGA. Well, I guess I get to wrap this up. One final welcome 
to Arkansas. We’re just so pleased to be able to be part of this dia-
logue.  And  so  I  would  like  to  share  a  few  comments  with  you.  I’m 
here  today  representing  Cox  Communications.  And  from  Green 
Forest to Fort Smith, Cox Arkansas provides 99 percent of the com-
munities we serve with state-of-the-art broadband fiber technology. 
Our customers experience a digital world that we believe is second 
to  none  in  64  rural  and  urban  towns.  And  we  invest  over  $25  mil-
lion  of  private-risk  capital  every  year  in  Arkansas,  expanding  our 
bandwidth  capacity,  and  our  communications  infrastructure,  ren-
dering the fastest Internet speeds available to residential and busi-
ness  customers.  The  philosophy  of  our  400  Cox  Communications 
Arkansas  employees  is  really  to  make  a  difference  in  the  towns

that we serve. Annually, we provide more than 360 free cable con-
nections  to  K  through  12  schools,  educational  access  channels  val-
ued  at  more  than  $3.6  million,  and  we  donate  over  $1  million  in 
air  time  every  year  to  nonprofit  organizations  through  PSAs.  We 
don’t 
just  limit  our  consideration  to  deploying  the  best  in 
broadband, though. We also are concerned with the appropriate use 
of that asset. One of the most significant things we do for our com-
munities, truly relates to the grass roots implementation of our na-
tional program called Take Charge!, which is an initiative designed 
to  increase  customers’  awareness  and  use  of  the  parental  controls 
and content-filtering tools now available for the cable, Internet, and 
telephone  services  found  in  the  digital  home.  This  program  puts 
content management into the hands of the individual consumer, al-
lowing  them  to  set  the  guidelines  that  they  deem  appropriate  for 
their own homes. 

Our  seriousness  about  helping  families  navigate  the  top  tech-
nology  that  we  provide  extends  beyond  our  Take  Charge!  website, 
the PSAs that we run, the Internet safety workshops, and partner-
ship  that  we  have  with  The  National  Center  of  Missing  and  Ex-
ploited Children. Cox has also begun forging local, meaningful part-
nerships  with  regional  law  enforcement  agencies  in  support  of 
Internet  Crimes  Against  Children  investigative  units  through  two 
technology grants recently through Cox Communications to support 
specialized equipment and training. The Fayetteville Police Depart-
ment has identified, apprehended, and seen multiple Internet child 
predators  successfully  sentenced.  Each  time  the  news  of  arrests  of 
this  kind  becomes  public,  we  know  the  financial  investment  that 
we make to support the ICAC program means that dozens or more 
young people will be safer from exploitation. 

Our  employees  are  proud  to  know  that  not  only  is  Cox  Commu-
nications bringing the world into our customers’ homes through our 
products,  but  we’re  also  giving  critical  support  to  the  people  who 
help make that world a little bit safer. Thank you so much for the 
opportunity to make these comments, and I would be pleased to an-
swer any questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF KELLY HALE ZEGA, STATE MANAGER, PUBLIC AFFAIRS, 

COX COMMUNICATIONS, ARKANSAS 

Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Pryor,  Commissioners  Copps  and  Adelstein,  I  appear  be-
fore  you  today  on  behalf  of  Cox  Communications.  We  welcome  this  dialogue  on  the 
The State of Broadband in Arkansas. 

From  Green  Forest  to  Fort  Smith,  Cox  Arkansas  provides  99  percent  of  the  com-
munities  we  serve  with  state-of-the-art  broadband  fiber  technology.  In  short,  our 
customers  experience  a  digital  world  that  is  second  to  none  in  64  rural  and  urban 
towns.  We  invest  more  than  25  million  dollars  of  private  risk  capital  each  year  in 
Arkansas  expanding  our  bandwidth  capacity  and  communications  infrastructure, 
rendering  the  fastest  Internet  speeds  available  to  residential  and  business  cus-
tomers. 

The  philosophy  of  our  400  Cox  Communications  Arkansas  employees  is  to  make 
a difference in the towns we serve and in which we live. We provide more than 360 
free  cable  connections  to  K–12  schools,  educational  access  channels  valued  at  more 
than $3.6 million every year, and annually donate over $1 million in airtime to non- 
profit  organizations  through  the  broadcast  and  production  of  public  service  an-
nouncements. 

One of the most significant things we do for our communities relates to the grass 
roots  implementation  of  our  national  program  Take  Charge!,  an  initiative  designed 
to  increase  customers’  awareness  and  use  of  the  parental  controls  and  content  fil-

tering  tools  now  available  for  the  cable  television,  Internet  and  telephone  services 
found  in  a  digital  home.  This  program  puts  the  content  management  of  television 
and  Internet  into  the  hands  of  the  individual  customer,  allowing  them  to  set  the 
guidelines they deem appropriate for their own homes. 

Our seriousness about helping families safely navigate the technology we provide 
extends  beyond  our  information-packed  Take  Charge!  website,  public  service  an-
nouncements,  Internet  safety  workshops  and  partnership  with  the  National  Center 
for Missing and Exploited Children. Cox has also begun forging meaningful partner-
ships with regional law enforcement agencies in support of Internet Crimes Against 
Children investigative units. Through two initial technology grants from Cox to sup-
port  specialized  equipment  and  training,  the  Fayetteville  Police  Department  has 
identified, apprehended and seen multiple Internet child predators successfully sen-
tenced.  Each  time  the  news  of  an  arrest  of  this  kind  becomes  public,  we  know  the 
financial  investment  to  support  the  ICAC  program  means  dozens  or  more  young 
people  will  be  safer  from  exploitation.  Our  employees  are  proud  to  know  that  not 
only  is  Cox  Communications  bringing  the  world  into  our  customers’  homes  through 
our  products—we’re  also  giving  critical  support  to  the  people  who  make  that  world 
a little safer. 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  present  these  brief  comments  and  I  would  be 

pleased to answer questions you may have. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Thank  you.  This  wraps  up  our  statements,  and 
I  appreciate  all  the  witnesses  for  trying  their  best  to  stay  within 
the  time  limits  and  time  constraints  that  we  have.  I  have  a  few 
questions,  and  I  think  the  Commissioners  may  have  a  few  ques-
tions  as  well.  Let  me,  if  I  may,  start  with  you,  Mr.  Gibson.  You 
mentioned this idea of carrier of last resort. I guess I have a couple 
of  questions  there  about  the  idea  of  carrier  of  last  resort  for 
broadband.  That  idea  includes  this  concept  that  no  matter  what 
happens  at  the  end  of  the  day,  your  company  has  to  provide  tele-
phone service for people who live in that area. 

Mr. GIBSON. Correct. 
Senator PRYOR. Do you think that we should adopt a Federal pol-
icy  that  there  should  be  a  carrier  of  last  resort  status  for 
broadband?  Are  you  willing  to  go  that  far?  And  also  you  talked 
about  the  USF,  and  basically—essentially  you  said  that  you  could 
not  have  done  your  investment  in  the  fiber  network  without  USF 
dollars.  Sounds  like  you  just  didn’t  have  the  revenue  locally,  to  do 
it  because  you  had  to  draw  from  USF  to  do  that,  and  how  impor-
tant that is, so if you could comment on both of those. 

Mr.  GIBSON.  You  know,  as  we’ve  talked  today,  a  lot  of  people 
have  said  that  we’re  moving  from  the  dial-tone  age  to  the 
broadband age. And if that is in fact the case, in 1960 when I was 
only providing telephone service—as a child, my parents were pro-
viding  at  that  time  service,  I  guess,  to  the  area,  we  felt  the  need 
for  a  carrier  of  last  resort  so  that  everyone  not  only  had  electrical 
service, but that everyone in my service area had telephone service. 
If we’re going to move from the dial-tone age to the broadband age, 
I can see there would be a tie there between those two. And maybe 
there  is  a  need  for  there  to  be  someone  to  provide  service  to  those 
that  are  the  farthest  out  that  are  the  highest  cost  that  some  of 
these other wireline people have talked about today that are in the 
rural  mountains  and  the  other  areas.  So  I’m  not  sure  that’s  not  a 
good idea. 

The  second  part,  the  USF  question  that  you  had  is  the  fact  that 
we couldn’t have done it. And we can’t sustain it without the USF. 
If we want these type of services in the rural areas, then there will 
have  to  be  some  help,  because  those  people  would  pay  hundreds

78 

and  hundreds  of  dollars  a  month  to  provide  the  facilities  in  those 
areas  that  we’re  trying  to  deploy.  And  so  I  think  everyone  in  the 
room  would  agree  that  without  some  sort  of  help,  whether  it’s  tax 
incentives  or  USF  money  or  whatever,  that  it  just  won’t  get  done. 
It just won’t, because I can tell you their business plans just won’t 
work  it  out.  There’s  not  a  business  plan  today  without  an  extreme 
cost to those customers. And that would work. 

Senator  PRYOR.  It’s  like  Mr.  Ashcraft  said,  the  last  group  is  the 
most  expensive  one.  It’s  easy  to  come  up  with  a  business  plan  to 
provide the service in an urban or densely-populated area. But the 
further you go out, the harder it is to make it work. 

Mr. GIBSON. And you know the case about that is, Senator, is the 
fact that we’ve spent our money up front. We spent our money. We 
made  the  commitment  to  the  people  in  our  communities,  and  we 
spent  it.  And  now  we  rely  upon  the  reliability  of  that  fund  to  sus-
tain us. And it is, someone mentioned earlier, that it’s not only put-
ting  it  into  the  ground,  it’s  not  only  getting  it  to  the  house,  it’s 
maintaining and keeping that updated to make it effective. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Mr.  Waits,  let  me  ask  you  if  I  may.  You  gave 
some  statistics  about  access  that  people  in  your  geographical  area 
have access, and they were very strong statistics, but one question 
I  have  is  the  actual  adoption  by  your  customers  of  those  services 
that  you  offer.  And  I’m  not  trying  to  get  into  your  company’s  pri-
vate  information  or  whatever  that  may  be  if  it’s  aware  that  they 
did this for proprietary, but I am curious about access versus adop-
tion  rate  generally,  and  your  thoughts  on  why  some  people  do  not 
access  those  services.  Is  it  an  affordability  issue?  Is  it  just  a  lack 
of interest issue? If you could talk about that. 

Mr.  WAITS.  My  short  answer  is  yes,  but  would  have  to  say  that 
in  really  rural  mountainous  areas—like  low  income  areas  like 
Boone  County  and  Newton  County,  as  I  mentioned  before,  out  of 
the  6,500  access  lines  that  we  have  and  we  can  make  available 
broadband  to  90  percent  of  them.  Our  take  rate  there  is  probably 
on the order of 15 percent. Now—— 

Senator PRYOR. So 15. 
Mr.  WAITS.  Fifteen  percent.  Now  anecdotally  we  think  that’s  be-
cause  of  low  computer  ownership,  computer  literacy.  That  number 
has  grown,  by  the  way,  considerably  in  just  the  last  12  months— 
12  to  18  months,  there  has  been  a  big  spike  in  DSL  demand  in 
those  rural  areas.  Part  of  it  is  because  there  is  a  different  demo-
graphic  moving  into  these  areas.  They’re  actually  growing  in  the 
sense  that  there  are  people  moving  from  California  and  other 
places that want to get a different quality of life in these beautiful 
mountainous  areas  around  Jasper  and  the  Buffalo  River.  In  east 
Arkansas, anecdotally speaking, we have 98 percent availability in 
some  of  the  poor  Delta  towns,  and  once  again,  10  to  15  percent 
take  rate  there.  In  our  cable  TV  areas,  we  have  100  percent  avail-
ability on those we pass and a take rate’s probably closer to 40 per-
cent  in  those  areas  I  can  only  guess  at  why  I  think,  there,  too,  it 
is dependent upon those areas that have a different socio-economic 
makeup,  lower  incomes,  lower  level  of  education,  typically  trans-
lated  into  lower  penetration  levels  for  broadband  access.  But  also 
a  very,  very  high  penetration  levels  for  digital  TV  ironically,  being 
a very cheap form of entertainment.

What  we  believe  though  is  that  there  is  going  to  be  dramatic 
change  as  the  delivery  of  video  services  evolves  over  the  public 
Internet.  And  that  entertainment  and  access  to  broadband  are 
going  to  be  more  and  more  synonymous.  So  whatever  it  is  today, 
we  believe  it  is  going  to  change  dramatically  or  has  at  least  that 
potential.  I’m  sure  cost  is  a  factor,  but  I  suspect  that  the  demo-
graphics,  age  of  the  people  in  these  areas  and  little  education  in 
these areas are a part of the factor. 

Mr. GARDNER. Senator Pryor, if I could, just to add to that. I can 
give you some color about our penetration into Arkansas. We cover 
about  73  percent  of  our  customers  in  Arkansas.  It’s  a  little  bit 
below our national average. It’s a less dense state, about 11 access 
lines per square mile in our property, 28 percent of all of our lines. 
So those penetration rates are pretty good, but our experience is 
it definitely gets to be an affordability issue. As you look at the Na-
tion and the fact that about 50 to 55 percent of our consumers have 
broadband  today,  the  fact  is  when  you  get  into  this  second  group, 
the second 45 percent, you’re looking at people who have lower in-
come  levels,  more  challenge  from  a  credit  perspective.  We’ve  tried 
repeatedly to make some adjustments to make that more accessible 
to this group of customers that we need to reach. And I think that’s 
going to be a big issue, and we talk about that a great deal in our 
testimony, on the affordability issue. 

Dr. LOWERY. I want to make a pitch for the fact that we’re think-
ing  traditionally  about  this,  and  the  healthcare  stuff  hasn’t  even 
begun  to  hit  this  yet.  And  as  it  does,  then  it  changes  the  demo-
graphics  dramatically,  because  now,  you’re  in  a  situation  to  where 
it’s  not  as  much  about  entertainment,  it’s  not  as  much  about  com-
puter  stuff  which  old  people  will  probably  never  do.  But  they  do 
need  health  care  and  they  need  to  have  nursing  visits  in  their 
home, they need to have their medicine adjusted in their home, and 
these sort of things are right on the doorstep. We’re on the doorstep 
of  this  stuff,  and  then  the  demographics  and  the  economics  of  the 
whole things change by this, I think. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Mr.  Ford,  let  me  ask  you.  You  mentioned  some-
thing.  You  told  us  to  think  about  three  different  things,  and  one 
of  them  was  mobility  in  broadband.  Could  you  elaborate  on  that  a 
little bit? I know we are very limited on time, but could you elabo-
rate  on  that  a  little  bit,  what  you  mean  by  mobility  in  broadband 
and the way you see the industry moving, technology moving? 

Mr.  FORD.  Yes,  sir.  I’ll  be  very  brief.  I  think  if  you  look  at  the 
questions  that  we’re  dealing  with  today,  which  is  not  only  accessi-
bility in terms of how do you get facilities in place to reach the con-
sumer,  but  also  provide  a  bandwidth  speed  that  is  appropriate  for 
at  least  certainly  most  of  the  applications  that  are  envisioned  for 
usage  today.  You’re  going  to  see  that  the  cheapest  way  to  deploy 
broadband is actually through mobility. 

Now, the USF is going to have to get resettled. No one’s arguing 
that. When you start to look at what’s it really going to cost to pro-
vide the next generation of services to rural America, over the next 
five  to  ten  years,  you’re  going  to  see  that  the  wireless  business  is 
going  to  be  able  to  provide  several  hundred  ‘‘K’’  data  speeds. 
They’re  never  just  physically  going  to  be  able  to  give  a  hundred 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:23 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00083 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75776.TXT JACKIE

80 

megabytes,  so  you  have  to  be  careful  about  getting  kind  of  caught 
up in a definition like that. 

But  we  will  be  able  to  provide  several  hundred  ‘‘K’’  of  data 
speeds to the most rural areas in the state. And what we’re trying 
to  fight  through  right  now  is  what  is  the  right  way  to  take  care 
of commitments to last provider status. And also so that everybody 
can  know  that  the  investments  that  they’ve  made  in  the  wireline 
business,  and  this  group  has  all  run  great  wireline  businesses 
across the state. We are blessed. This is kind of the Mecca of rural 
ILEC  companies  in  the  country,  and  the  best-run  one  in  the  coun-
try is the one Mr. Gardner runs. But the smaller carriers in Arkan-
sas have long histories of a hundred years plus of being able to pro-
vide great service here. I think as you look forward, there is a place 
for  protection  of  their  money  in  USF  for  the  investments  that 
they’ve made. And I think there is also a place particularly because 
wireless customers now provide almost a third of the Fund. 

Well,  they  don’t  provide  it  through  wireless  service  because  they 
don’t use wireless service, they provide it as a customer of wireless. 
So  customers  are  moving  to  wireless.  And  I  think  they’re  going  to 
expect  that  subsidy  to  flow  back  into  the  products  that  they  were 
originally  funding  the  USF  from  in  the  first  place.  And  how  we 
wrestle  through  that  is  frankly  going  to  take  someone  with  your 
kind  of  demeanor  that  doesn’t  get  emotionally  caught  up  in  it  and 
doesn’t  make  it  partisan  to  kind  of  wade  through  the  ‘‘puts’’  and 
‘‘takes’’ of how you come up with legislation around that and regu-
lations in the FCC, they propagate, to make sure that nobody gets 
blown  up  and  that  the  customers  actually  get  the  benefit  of  what 
we’re all talking about. 

Senator PRYOR. Did you have a question? 
Commissioner  ADELSTEIN.  It’s  a  follow  up  to  your  question.  I 
think  that  this  is  just  the  kind  of  dialogue  that’s  needed  to  bring 
this  group  together  to  talk  about  an  issue  of  such  urgency  for  the 
future of the state or all of rural America really. Given this group, 
among  the  questions  you’ve  talked  about  affordability,  we  have  a 
certain  two  themes  going  through  today:  There’s  availability  and 
how to get it to everybody. And if you do get it out to them, afford-
ability—how do we make sure they can afford it. And what strikes 
me as a major concern is that if it is more expensive in rural areas, 
that  is  a  major  hurdle  where  you  already  have  greater  poverty 
issues  in  the  rural  part  of  the  state.  If  the  price  of  broadband  is 
more  expensive  there,  then  that’s  sort  of  a  double  hurdle,  and  I’m 
concerned  about  that.  Dominik  and  I  last  night  talked  a  little  bit 
about  what’s  going  on  in  the  Delta  and  some  of  the  problems  that 
you’re  having  even  building  out  let  alone  getting  people  to  be  able 
to afford broadband. I’m just curious. Are the prices higher in rural 
Arkansas than in the urban parts where there is more competition 
and it’s cheaper to serve and what can we do about that? 

Mr.  MJARTAN.  I  can  comment  a  little  bit  on  the  pricing.  We’ve 
looked  at  some  prices,  for  example,  in  Helena/West  Helena  the 
rural area in Phillips County and the prices are about the same as 
in  the  more  urban  areas  for  the  larger  providers.  But  the  chal-
lenges  that  we’re  seeing  is  with  some  of  the  satellites  and  that’s 
maybe  what  Mr.  Ford  was  talking  about  in  some  of  the  more  mo-

bile  broadband  access  Internet  via  satellite,  it’s  really  cost-prohibi-
tive. 

So  there  are  some  options  like  that  that  would  be  available  to  a 
community like Lakeview, Arkansas, but it is cost prohibitive. And 
we have a lot of experience with low income programs and various 
asset-building  programs.  So  we  have,  an  idea  of  what  an  average 
family in the Delta can afford to spend a month and when we were 
looking at the options, we realized very few of them would be able 
to  afford  a  $40  a  month  subscription  fee  or  even  $20  a  month, 
might  be  cost-prohibitive.  Commissioner  Adelstein,  any  other 
thoughts  on  pricing  and  what  we  can  do  to  make  sure  prices 
are—— 

Mr. WINNINGHAM. I’m sorry. But if I could say, we’re only talking 
about two dimensions of a problem that’s got at least three dimen-
sions  to  it.  We  could  put  broadband  into  the  home  and  organiza-
tion—of  every  home  and  organization  in  the  state,  and  we  would 
not get the blessings that we want for our state from that. We need 
to  prepare  this  state  to  make  the  most  of  broadband.  We’re  in  a 
global  economic  competition  with  the  rest  of  the  world.  I  have  a 
brother-in-law  in  his  late  seventies—there  is  no  age  limit,  by  the 
way,  on  the  blessings  of  broadband—in  his  late  seventies.  Five 
years ago I don’t think he had ever touched a computer. Now, he’s 
an avid eBay user. 

And  it’s  because  he  had  somebody  in  the  family  that  understood 
that  he  could  get  something  at  a  better  price.  We  need  to  not  only 
show  the  people  of  Arkansas.  And  broadband  is  not  like  a  road  or 
it  is  a  little  more  like  electricity.  If  you  want  to  run  electricity  to 
my house and I’d never heard of it before, I don’t really care, espe-
cially  if  it’s  going  to  cost  me  money.  But  if  I  can  understand  that 
it will make the lights stay on after dark, then I can become inter-
ested  in  that.  If  grandparents  can  understand  that  they  can  com-
municate  with  kids  in  college,  if  businesses  can  understand  that 
they  can  market  outside  of  Arkansas,  outside  of  the  United 
States—if  we  can  prepare  people,  then  we’ll  get  the  blessings  that 
we need for the state. 

And  if  we  look  to—we  have  a  lot  of  intellect,  a  lot  of  under-
standing  of  this  technology  in  our  state  in  the  form  of  EAST  labs 
and  high  school  students  that  grandparents  will  come  to  listen  to 
talk about this kind of thing, but preparation is the big part. If we 
can  make  people  understand  the  value  of  it,  there  will  be  a  lot 
more  broadband  around  right  now.  Preparation  is  the  key,  and 
that’s got to be followed by deployment, and affordability is also es-
sential. 

Mr.  GARDNER.  If  I  could  on  that  affordability  issue,  across  our 
footprint, which I said earlier was 16 states, there are not huge dif-
ferences,  Commissioner,  in  prices  from  a  more  urban  area  to  a 
more  rural  area,  maybe  $19.99  on  the  low  end  in  our  markets  to 
$29.99,  $34.99  on  the  high  end.  So  I  think  it  gets  much  more  to 
this  affordability  issue  as  you’ll  see  big  differences  in  average  in-
come across those markets. 

Senator PRYOR. Did you have something you wanted to add? 
Mr.  WAITS.  I  did.  The  vehicle  we  used  for  many,  many  years  to 
keep rates and services comparable between urban and rural areas 
as  mandated  in  the  Telecom  Reform  Act  of  1996,  was  some  form 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:23 Sep 17, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00085 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75776.TXT JACKIE

82 

of  cost  averaging,  and  we’re  averaging  across  urban  and  rural 
areas.  I  think  we  all  have  seen  the  USF  or  other  forms  implicitly 
do  that.  So  if  you  want  to  maintain  that  comparability  in  services 
and  rates  then  some  form  of  averaging  continues  to  be  required. 
This  idea  of  a  obligation  of  last  resort  that  we  had  that  we  inher-
ited also came with it an exclusive right to serve. And so there may 
be an option there to reinstate some exclusivity in terms of support 
and  response  for  some  obligations  to  serve.  And  that  might  be  a 
way to more predictably and more reliably enact some form of rate 
averaging. 

Commissioner  ADELSTEIN.  As  long  as  there  is  an  influential 
member  of  Congress  here,  I  think  it  goes  outside  the  FCC  but  I 
learned  recently,  talked  about,  if  you  get  broadband  to  everybody 
and  they’re  not  ready  for  it,  it’s  not  going  to  make  a  difference.  I 
learned  recently  that  somewhere  in  South  Korea  they  provide  a 
computer  to  anybody  for—if  they’re  low  income,  they  go  to  their 
local library, and for a dollar or two a month, they can rent a com-
puter.  And  how  much  of  an  issue  is  it  in  the  lower  income  areas, 
people that don’t have computers at all, and should the government 
do  more  to  get  computers  in  the  hands  of  people  so  they  can  take 
advantage of the broadband that is available. 

Mr. WINNINGHAM. It’s a big issue, again, that the person, the stu-
dent  who  has  broadband  in  the  home  has  got  several  hours  a  day 
to use that. The student who has to go somewhere else has got an 
hour  or  two  if  they  can  get  to  one  of  the  computers.  But  there  is 
a difference between computer education and broadband education. 
Computer  education  is—you  have  to  have  it.  But  broadband  edu-
cation  is  what  you  really  have  to  have  to  see  this  state  and  this 
Nation spring forth the way it needs to. 

Senator PRYOR. Did you have a question? 
Commissioner COPPS. Well, this is something you just mentioned 
that  is  really  going  to  be  a  priority  of  the  Connect  Arkansas,  that 
is the broadband education. 

Mr. WINNINGHAM. Yes, sir. What we need is we need broadband, 
not just at the end of the street, we need it at the other end of the 
cotton  field  if  somebody  lives  there.  But  we  need  to  help  that  per-
son  understand  how  to  use  it.  If  they  don’t  do  that  then  the  de-
mand won’t be there. These folks won’t be able to provide someone 
to maintain it. The story just gets worse and worse. But if you pre-
pare  people  ahead  of  time,  once  you’ve  used  broadband,  it’s  hard 
to get loose from it. 

Commissioner COPPS. I don’t want to open up any other subjects, 
but I just would like to make a general comment. A number of peo-
ple have mentioned comprehensive reform of the Universal Service 
system,  and  I  think  we  get  in  the  mind-set  where  we  think,  well, 
this is taking so long, it’s never going to happen. But I’m a member 
of  the  Universal  Service  Joint  Board,  and  I  think  these  issues  are 
being  teed  up.  I  think  there  is  tremendous  support  on  the  Joint 
Board  for  including  broadband  in  the  Universal  Service  system.  I 
think  there  is  a  wide-spread  support  to  look  at  a  rational  cost  and 
reimbursement  system  and  doing  something  in  the  identical  sup-
port rule that is there. Chairman Martin has expressed an interest 
in  reverse  auctions.  I’m  not  going  to  ask  about  that,  because  that 
would  take  us  a  long  time.  But  all  I  want  to  say  is  I  think  that

these  things  have  a  possibility  of  being  teed  up  sooner,  actually, 
rather  than  later.  And  I  would  just  like  to  solicit  your  ongoing 
input  and  your  ongoing  comment  to  our  offices  at  the  FCC  on  all 
of these issues as they become teed up in the months ahead. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Well,  listen,  both  of  our  Commissioners  have  to 
catch  planes  this  afternoon,  so  I  know  that  a  few  of  you  want  to 
have just a few moments to mix and mingle with them. And I want 
to  thank  them  for  coming  to  Arkansas.  It’s  taken  two  days  out  of 
their schedules, very, very busy schedules, as Scott Ford mentioned 
a few moments ago. But thank you all for being here. We really en-
joyed having you here in the state, enjoyed hosting you, and I hope 
you  will  always  consider  this  your  second  home,  and  always  know 
that you’re welcome back and we want to help in any way we can. 
The  other  thing  on  housekeeping  I  just  want  to  say  is  that  for 
all  of  you  all  who  have  prepared  written  testimony  that  will  be 
made  part  of  the  record.  We  will  leave  the  record  open  for  seven 
days  in  case  someone  wants  to  add  something.  I  noticed  some 
maps,  etc.  We  can  include  those  in  the  record.  If  you  want  to  do 
that, we’ll leave that open for seven days. And also if anyone wants 
to  add  some  written  comments  on  some  of  the  discussion  you’ve 
heard  today,  it  will  be  open  for  seven  days,  so  if  you  want  to  go 
back and work on some of that. 
I would say that some of the take-aways that I have is that from our statements 
today  is  that  our  students  and  our  state  know  that  expansion  of  broadband  in  Ar-
kansas is essential, that we need to think big, that we have tremendous opportuni-
ties for broadband in this state, in this country, whether it’s health-related matters, 
whether it’s information, education, just general quality of life, economic opportuni-
ties. 

We have tremendous opportunities here in this state and in this 
country, in rural America, to utilize broadband in a very, very posi-
tive  and  productive  way.  We  need  to  look  at  changes  in  the  USF, 
and  look  at  funding  mechanisms  to  make  sure  we  can  get 
broadband out there, if there is access. And as we’ve said, it’s more 
complicated than just an access question. 

The other thing is—I think that Commissioner Copps said in the 
very  beginning—is  we  need  a  national  strategy.  We  can’t  really  do 
this  just  in  a  vacuum  or  just  think,  hey,  this  idea  might  be  good. 
Let’s  try  that  idea—might  be  good.  We  really  need  to  sit  down,  all 
of  us,  the  people  in  this  room,  members  of  Congress,  the  FCC,  the 
President—all need to sit down and work through a national strat-
egy.  We’ve  talked  about  those  statistics,  how  the  U.S.  is  losing  its 
position  globally.  That’s  not  acceptable.  And  we  have  to  acknowl-
edge that’s not acceptable and do something about it. You all, I ap-
preciate  your  comments.  I  appreciate  your  preparation,  your  time, 
for  being  here.  This  has  been  a  very  informative  and  productive 
hearing. And, again, I want to thank everyone for participating. So, 
in  lieu  of  the  gavel,  I  once  again  gavel  the  closing  with  my  Black-
berry. Thank you. 

[Whereupon, at 12 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HENRY G. HULTQUIST, VICE PRESIDENT, 

FEDERAL REGULATORY, AT&T 

Policymakers  have  before  them  an  opportunity  to  bring  one  of  the  20th  century’s 
most  important  telecom  policy  initiatives—universal  service—into  the  21st  century. 
During  the  last  century,  Federal  and  state  universal  service  programs  and  policies 
largely succeeded in making narrowband voice telecommunication services available 
in  rural  areas  across  the  country.  Federal  and  State  policymakers  now  face  a  new 
challenge: to maintain the commitment to affordable basic service in an increasingly 
competitive and technologically sophisticated marketplace while also encouraging in-
vestment in the broadband and wireless networks necessary to provide the services 
that consumers and businesses require today. 

As recent Congressional hearings made clear, there is growing consensus that the 
existing  Federal  universal  service  fund  (USF)  high-cost  support  mechanisms  are 
deeply  flawed.  There  is  almost  an  equally  strong  consensus  that  further  extending 
broadband  and  wireless  deployment  into  rural  areas  is  a  critical  national  policy 
goal. However, simply adding broadband and wireless to the USF mix without fun-
damental reform of the high-cost support regime will only increase the strain on this 
already broken system and doom to failure efforts to promote additional broadband 
and wireless infrastructure investment in rural areas. 

Rather than adapting the current high-cost mechanisms to achieve its broadband 
and wireless deployment objectives, AT&T has urged the FCC to address broadband 
and  wireless  deployment  needs  directly  and  outside  of  the  current  mechanisms. 
AT&T  has  recently  proposed  broadband  and  wireless  pilot  programs  designed  spe-
cifically to promote network investment in rural areas quickly while also, and criti-
cally,  enhancing  our  understanding  of  whether  and/or  how  best  to  use  USF  to  sup-
port  this  objective  over  the  longer  term.  The  proposed  pilots  are  modeled  after  the 
FCC’s rural healthcare pilot program and would utilize the expertise of both Federal 
and  State  regulators  to  create  a  streamlined  and  focused  initiative  that  could  be 
operational within a year. While both pilots are important to the future of USF, this 
testimony will focus on the broadband pilot. 
The AT&T Rural Broadband Pilot 

AT&T  has  proposed  that  the  FCC  establish  a  two-year  Rural  Broadband  Pilot 
Program  to  support  deployment  of  broadband  infrastructure  in  underserved  rural 
areas. Under the Pilot, applications would be submitted to the FCC and State Com-
missions  and  funding  would  be  distributed  to  approved  applicants  to  support  new 
capital  investment  in  infrastructure  necessary  to  provide  consumers  in  such  areas 
access  to  advanced  telecommunications  and  information  services.  Participation  in 
the  Pilot  Program  by  providers  would  be  purely  voluntary,  with  providers  free  to 
choose whether to apply for funding based on their own evaluations of the final pro-
gram  requirements.  The  key  features  of  the  AT&T  Broadband  Pilot  fall  into  the 
three steps outlined below. 
Step 1 

The  FCC  would  determine  in  advance  the  fundamental  parameters  of  the  Pilot 
such as the available funding, geographic scope, supported service, definition of un-
derserved, and other eligibility criteria. 

a.  Funding:  The  FCC  would  specify  the  Pilot  funding  level,  such  as  $1  billion 
per year for 2 years and the source of funding. (AT&T, which is one of the larg-
est  contributors  to  the  Federal  USF,  recognizes  that  the  size  of  the  fund  may 
need  to  increase  to  meet  all  the  goals  policymakers  have  outlined.)  Providers 
whose applications are chosen for support will receive a one-time grant of funds 
to cover their proposed project. 
b.  Providers:  The  Pilot  would  be  open  to  all  service  providers  that  are  capable 
of providing the supported service. Providers would not be required to be ETCs

86 

to  apply  for  Pilot  funding  but  would  be  required  to  meet  certain  Pilot  require-
ments and thus to become a Broadband Eligible Provider or BEP. 
c. Geographic Area: The general area eligible for Pilot funding should be identi-
fied  by  the  FCC  and  should  be  based  on  rural  Census  Block  Groups.  The  FCC 
should define ‘‘rural’’ as that term is used in the 2000 Census. 
d.  Underserved:  The  FCC  should  issue  a  standard  definition  of  ‘‘underserved’’ 
for  use  by  states  in  evaluating  applications.  Underserved  should  be  defined  as 
areas  where  the  supported  service  is  not  substantially  available  to  households 
within  the  rural  service  area  for  which  the  applicant  seeks  funding.  The  FCC 
would also establish a specific criterion or other measures for determining ‘‘sub-
stantially available,’’ such as, for example, that 85 percent of the households in 
the service area do not have access to the supported service. 
e.  Supported  Service:  The  FCC  should  define  in  advance  that  the  supported 
service  is  broadband  Internet  access  service  that  meets  the  definition  of  ‘‘Ad-
vanced  Telecommunications  Capability’’  as  set  forth  in  Section  706  of  the  1996 
Act.  The  FCC  should  also  define  other  parameters  such  as  minimum  down-
stream  and  upstream  transmission  capability,  as  well  as  any  other  applicable 
service parameters. 
f.  Eligibility  Requirements:  The  FCC  should  identify  basic  eligibility  require-
ments  that  all  applications  for  funding  must  meet,  such  as:  financial  qualifica-
tion criteria; deployment schedule that does not exceed 2 years; commitment to 
provide  service  at  an  affordable  rate;  commitment  to  provide  supported  service 
throughout the application area for a minimum of 5 years following completion 
of project; information that indicates the project area is ‘‘underserved’’; and type 
of facilities and equipment, and resulting coverage, that will be deployed. 

Step 2 

Interested providers would submit applications to the relevant State Public Serv-
ice Commissions who would determine eligibility based on FCC-defined parameters. 
a. Application Frequency: To minimize administrative and transaction costs, ap-
plications  for  the  Pilot  could  be  accepted  and  processed  in  one  round  prior  to 
the start of the first program year. 
(That  is,  the  FCC  would  identify  winning  applicants  for  both  funding  years 
prior  to  the  first  year,  but  disburse  no  more  than  $1  billion  in  each  program 
year.) 
b. Application Process: An interested service provider submits an application to 
the  relevant  State  Public  Service  Commission  in  which  it  identifies  a  specific 
rural  area  that  it  believes  is  ‘‘underserved’’  by  broadband  and  for  which  the 
service provider seeks funding to deploy facilities to provide the supported serv-
ices.  The  provider  presents  a  project  proposal,  amount  of  new  capital  invest-
ment for which funding is requested, and supporting documentation. 
c.  State  Review:  States  are  responsible  for  (1)  verifying  that  the  area  covered 
by  the  application  meets  the  FCC’s  definition  of  ‘‘underserved,’’  and  (2)  deter-
mining  that  the  application  meets  all  other  FCC-defined  eligibility  require-
ments.  States  have  the  local  knowledge  to  verify  whether  the  applicant-identi-
fied  service  area  is  underserved  and  this  simple  process  is  a  time  and  resource 
efficient  method  of  targeting  funding  to  rural  areas  that  are  in  most  need  of 
support.  States  could  use  various  methods  for  such  verification  including  put-
ting applications out for public comment. 

Step 3 

States would submit all qualified applications to the FCC which conducts the final 
review  and  selects  a  single  provider  in  each  geographic  area  in  which  applications 
were submitted. 

a. Application Ranking: If the Pilot is oversubscribed, the FCC should rank ap-
plications  by  number  of  households  to  be  served  and  give  highest  ranking  and 
higher  priority  to  projects  that  result  in  the  greatest  number  of  households  re-
ceiving  the  supported  service.  Deployment  timelines  may  also  help  guide  the 
ranking process with preference given to shorter time to market. 
b.  FCC  Review  Criteria:  The  FCC  should  establish  general  selection  criteria  in 
advance  of  the  Pilot  launch.  These  criteria  will  be  used  by  the  FCC  to  guide 
its  selection  of  applications  that  will  receive  funding,  especially  in  the  event  a 
service area has multiple applications or the Pilot is oversubscribed. To enhance 
the learning from the Pilot, the FCC should fund a variety of projects (large and

87 

small)  and  in  different  regions  to  achieve  some  geographic  balance  and  maxi-
mize experience with broadband deployment in disparate topographies. 
c. Number of Grants: The FCC should limit funding to only one provider in any 
particular area even if more than one provider applies for funding. If only a sin-
gle  application  is  submitted  for  an  area  the  Commission  should  not  be  com-
pelled  to  grant  funding  if  the  application  does  not  meet  the  selection  criteria. 
In  a  final  step,  the  FCC  should  report  on  the  results  of  the  Pilot  and  launch  a 
proceeding to consider whether the program or some modified version should be con-
tinued. AT&T believes that the Rural Broadband Pilot Program can have a measur-
able impact on broadband deployment in underserved rural areas while at the same 
providing  both  Federal  and  State  policymakers  with  valuable  real-life  information 
on  how  to  effectively  support  broadband  deployment  in  rural  areas.  Equally  impor-
tant  for  rural  America,  establishing  both  the  Broadband  and  Wireless  pilots  will 
help clear the way for fundamental reform of the existing high-cost support mecha-
nisms and thus ensure that the Universal Service program can meet the challenges 
of the new 21st century telecommunication landscape. 

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL PROVIDED BY DAVID BURDICK 

Commissioner  Michael  Copps  asked  me  a  question  about  how  many  libraries  in 
Arkansas are still on dial-up Internet access. The State Library provided me the fol-
lowing information: 

As  of  January,  2007,  10  (ten)  libraries  were  still  on  dial-up,  137  were  on  DSL, 
and 38 were on cable. It is unknown how many are on dedicated 56k lines. The rest 
are on T–1 or partial (386) T–1 lines. 

There are 7 libraries which do not have Internet access at all. 
In  the  discussion  there  were  comments  made,  particularly 

from  James 
Winningham and Sam Walls, which said something like: ‘‘Kids need access at home 
because  libraries  close  . . .’’,  and  ‘‘We  need  to  get  a  computer  and  Internet  access 
into the hands of all Arkansans. . . .’’ 

As  a  librarian,  I  agree  with  both  statements,  but  I  also  know  that  the  Public  Li-
brary  will  need  to  offer  services  to  those  who  don’t  have  access.  People  have  had 
the option to buy books for a few hundred years now. But Public Libraries still cir-
culate millions of books because people either can’t afford, or wish not to spend their 
money on books. 

Public  libraries  offer  all  types  of  services  to  anyone  and  everyone  who  walk 
through the doors. Most libraries allow people to use the computer workstations re-
gardless of whether or not they live within the Library’s jurisdiction. In Pine Bluff, 
we allow anyone to use the computers. 

Two years ago Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast 
very hard. In Pine Bluff, as in many public libraries throughout Arkansas, our pub-
lic computers were used by Katrina victims to communicate with relatives, find lost 
loved  ones,  file  FEMA  forms,  and  in  at  least  one  case,  a  Lawyer  who  came  to  Pine 
Bluff, keep a business going. We also set up a wireless network to allow people who 
had their own laptops access to the Internet. 

We serve travelers who are passing through. We serve people who just moved into 
the  community.  We  serve  students  from  the  two  local  colleges.  We  serve  those  who 
come to the library from the nearby Salvation Army. A large number of people don’t 
own  a  computer  or  don’t  have  Internet  access,  but  there  are  those  who  just  want 
to come to the library to use our resources. For instance, there is a elderly man who 
can  afford  his  own  computer,  who  can  afford  Internet  access,  who  comes  in  two  or 
three  times  every  day.  I  asked  him  once  why  he  didn’t  just  buy  his  own  computer, 
and  his  reply  was,  ‘‘Dave,  I  just  enjoy  coming  in  and  seeing  all  the  friendly  people 
who  work  at  the  library,  and  the  people  who  are  using  the  computers  in  the  lab. 
I just enjoy the company. . . .’’ 

There will always be those who simply don’t own a computer, or even want to own 
a  computer.  It  is  my  belief  that  public  libraries  will  be  offering  computer  services 
for a long time to those who simply don’t have access any other way.
