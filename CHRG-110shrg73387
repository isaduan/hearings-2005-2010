THE  PRESENT  AND  FUTURE  OF  THE 

UNIVERSAL  SERVICE  FUND 

THURSDAY,  MARCH  1,  2007 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:03  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Daniel  K.  Inouye, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator  STEVENS [presiding].  The  Chairman  is  stuck  in  traffic 
and has asked me to start the hearing. I suggest we just allow the 
witnesses to begin, and wait for the Chairman to make his opening 
statement. Does that agree with you, Senator? 

We  welcome  you  all  and  look  forward  to  your  statements.  We 
would  appreciate  it  if  you  can  be  as  short  as  you  desire,  but  all  of 
your statements will be printed in the record as though read. 

Please. Ms. Tate? 

STATEMENT OF HON. DEBORAH TAYLOR TATE, 

COMMISSIONER, FCC AND CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL-STATE JOINT 

BOARD ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE 

Ms. TATE. Yes, good morning. Good morning, Vice Chairman Ste-
vens  and  esteemed  members  of  the  Committee.  Thank  you  all  for 
the honor, really, of being here today. 

I know that the entire Joint Board appreciates having the oppor-
tunity  to  actually  have  a  dialogue  with  you  all.  Many  of  you  all 
have  been  so  instrumental  in  championing  Universal  Service  poli-
cies for our Nation. 

Last  month,  the  FCC  Commissioners  testified  before  you  and  I 
stated then my commitment to Universal Service, no matter where 
Americans live. I re-emphasize that commitment today. 

Also, this week, as you know, we celebrated the 10th anniversary 
of  E-Rate.  And  I  just  wanted  to  thank  Senators  Snowe  and  Rocke-
feller for their leadership and vision for generations of young Amer-
icans. 

First,  I’d  like  to  applaud  Senator  Stevens  on  the  introduction  of 
the Universal Service for Americans Act, which addresses an array 
of Universal Service issues, and, on the contributions side, provides 
broader  statutory  authority  for  the  FCC  to  assess  both  interstate 
and  intrastate  revenues,  a  solution  to  expanding  and  stabilizing 
the contribution base that’s not available under the present Act. It

was  also,  I  might  note,  recommended  unanimously  by  a  previous 
Joint  Board.  So,  I  look  forward  to  a  continued  dialogue  with  Sen-
ators Smith and Dorgan and Pryor and other members of this com-
mittee who will be introducing legislation. 

Today, obviously I’m here not just as an FCC Commissioner, but 
also  as  the  Chair  of  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board,  a  role  that  I’m 
honored  to  serve  and  take  seriously,  and  obviously  am  very,  very 
pleased  to  be  joined  by  a  number  of  my  colleagues  on  the  Joint 
Board. I want to thank them, as well as my colleagues who are not 
here, for their commitment to the in-depth study of what are really 
complex  issues.  I  also  appreciate  our  mutual  desire  to  build  a  con-
sensus  to  address  the  challenges  before  us.  As  I  stated  at  the  en 
banc  hearing,  the  good  news  is  that  I  think  we  all  truly  share  the 
same  goal;  it’s  just  working  on  how  we  best  reach  the  goals  that 
are set forth in the Act, given the challenges of today’s ever-chang-
ing technology and, of course, the growing marketplace. 

I’ve seen and experienced firsthand the opportunities provided by 
Universal  Service  in  rural  parts  of  Tennessee,  probably  impossible 
without the Universal Service program. 

In my written testimony, I provided you with an overview of the 
work  that  we’ve  done  to  date  during  the  past  year  since  I  became 
Chairman,  but  today  I  thought  I’d  just  like  to  focus  on  providing 
some  context  for  all  the  rest  of  the  panel  presenters  that  you  all 
will hear today regarding the growth of the Fund. 

A  modern  and  high-quality  communications  infrastructure  is  es-
sential to ensure that all Americans, including those living in rural 
areas,  have  access  to  the  opportunities  that  broadband  provides. 
The  Joint  Board,  like  this  committee,  has  renewed  the  debate  re-
garding  Universal  Service  funding  for  broadband  in  underserved 
areas.  However,  changes  in  technology  and  increasing  numbers— 
the  numbers  of  carriers  who  are  receiving  Universal  Service  sup-
port—have grown dramatically and place significant and increasing 
pressure on the stability of the Fund, which now provides approxi-
mately $4 billion through the high-cost mechanism alone. 

I brought a couple of charts that we had reviewed at our en banc. 
Chart 1 shows that, since 2003, the incumbent LEC payments have 
been  relatively  flat;  and,  they  have  actually  begun  to  go  down  just 
a  little  in  recent  years.  On  the  other  hand,  chart  1  shows  that  al-
most  all  of  the  recent  growth  in  the  high-cost  Universal  Service  is 
largely a result of CETCs’ access to high-cost support.

Chart  2  shows  that  the  USF  payments  to  CETCs  have  been 
growing  at  a  rate  of  101  percent  per  year  since  2002.  Specifically, 
in  2000,  CETCs  received  a  million  dollars.  We  expect  that  to  be  a 
billion in 2006. 

Chart  3  shows  the  rapid  year-over-year  dollar  growth  of  CETCs. 
This also highlights another problem, and that is that CETCs pres-

ently, as you know, receive Universal Service support based on the 
incumbent  LEC’s  embedded  cost,  or  the  per  line  support  amount 
that  the  incumbent  LEC  receives,  rather  than  support  based  on 
their own costs.

These  charts  show  that  our  current  high-cost  mechanism  is  in 
need  of  repair  and  revision.  Discussion  of  this  issue  should  not  in 
any  way  be  construed  as  critical  of  the  dazzling  array  of  services 
that  competitors,  including  wireless  providers,  are  bringing  to 
many  parts  of  our  country,  including  rural  areas.  However,  as  a 
Federal official, I believe that we are called to be good stewards of 
consumer dollars and the Fund. 

The  Chairman  and  others,  including  Verizon,  CTIA,  and  Alltel, 
and  I  think  you  will  hear  from  them  later,  have  proposed  various 
reverse  auctions  as  a  possible  mechanism  that  could  be  used  for 
distributing  high-cost  support.  Certainly,  auctions  could  provide 
technologically  and  competitively  neutral  means  of  controlling  the 
Fund’s growth and ensuring more efficient technology. 

Other commenters, some of whom you will hear from today, have 
discussed  other  tools:  geospatial  mapping,  more  targeted  distribu-
tion of support, and improved data-based decisionmaking. I hope to 
continue  to  facilitate  the  discussions  among  all  of  my  colleagues, 
while  doing  all  we  can  to  ensure  affordable,  quality  services  are 
available to consumers, no matter where they choose to live in this 
country.  However,  we  must  do  so  in  a  way  that  is  sustainable,  to 
allow  new  generations  of  Americans  to  have  access  to  the  latest 
generation  of  services,  so  that  our  country  and  our  citizens  can 
compete in the increasingly global economy. 

Thank  you  all,  and  I’m  pleased  to  answer  questions  after  the 

presentations. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. Tate follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DEBORAH TAYLOR TATE, COMMISSIONER, FCC AND 

CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL-STATE JOINT BOARD ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE 

Good  morning,  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  and  distinguished 
members  of  the  Committee.  I  especially  want  to  thank  you,  Chairman  Inouye  and 
Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  for  your  leadership  and  commitment  to  Universal  Service. 
I appreciate your invitation to participate in this hearing. It was exactly 1 month 
ago that I sat at this table before you with the other members of the Federal Com-
munications  Commission  (FCC  or  Commission).  At  that  time,  I  stated  my  commit-
ment to promoting the availability of quality, affordable telecommunications services 
to consumers—no matter where they live—across the United States and I reempha-
size that today. 

I  also  wanted  to  recognize  the  work  of  this  Committee  on  Universal  Service 
issues.  I  applaud  Senator  Stevens’  introduction  of  the  Universal  Service  for  Ameri-
cans Act, S. 101, which addresses an array of Universal Service issues. For example, 
the bill addresses Universal Service contributions by giving the Commission discre-
tion to assess both interstate and intrastate revenues—a solution to expanding and 
stabilizing  the  contribution  base  that  is  not  available  to  the  Commission  under  the 
existing  Act.  I  also  look  forward  to  working  with  other  members  of  this  Committee 
who may be introducing legislation on universal service. 

Today,  I  am  here  again  not  only  as  an  FCC  Commissioner,  but  also  in  my  role 
as Chair of the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service (Joint Board), a role 
that  I  am  honored  to  serve  and  greatly  respect.  I  am  pleased  that  I  am  joined  by 
some  of  my  Joint  Board  colleagues—fellow  FCC  colleague  Commissioner  Mike 
Copps,  Commissioner  Larry  Landis  of  Indiana,  Commissioner  John  Burke  of 
Vermont, and Director Billy Jack Gregg of the Consumer Advocate Division of West 
Virginia. All of the Joint Board members—those here today, as well as FCC Chair-
man  Martin,  Joint  Board  State  Chair  Ray  Baum  of  Oregon,  and  Commissioner 
Edgar  from  Florida—deserve  praise  for  their  commitment  to  the  in-depth  study  of 
these complex issues in addition to their full time jobs as government officials. I also 
appreciate our mutual desire to build consensus to address the challenges before us. 
Congress  required  the  FCC  to  institute  a  Joint  Board  ‘‘to  recommend  changes  to 
any  of  [the  FCC’s]  regulations  in  order  to  implement  sections  214(e)  and  [254]’’  of 
the Act. Accordingly, I welcome the opportunity to hear directly from you regarding

Universal Service issues facing the FCC, the industries we impact and most impor-
tantly,  as  section  254  of  the  Act  states,  ‘‘consumers  in  all  regions  of  the  Nation.’’ 
Like many of you, I have seen and experienced firsthand the opportunities provided 
by  Universal  Service  in  very  rural  areas.  I  remember  the  day  the  telephone  wire 
was  rolled  up  a  gravel  road  to  my  grandmother’s  house  in  rural  Tennessee—likely 
an impossibility without a Universal Service program. At the same time, in my roles 
at the FCC and on the Joint Board, I have a responsibility to preserve and advance 
the Universal Service Fund to best serve the public interest. 

Since  becoming  Chair  of  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service,  the 
Joint Board has continued its work to review the Universal Service policies and re-
spond to the FCC’s referrals. I have been committed to keeping our work on a time-
table paced to fulfill our statutory role in a thoughtful and deliberative manner, in-
cluding  holding  meetings  and  conference  calls,  issuing  notices,  and  reviewing  com-
ments.  The  Joint  Board  staff  held  a  retreat  for  3  days  in  June  2006  to  review  out-
standing  and  new  proposals,  and  the  Joint  Board  met  in  August  2006  during  the 
NARUC  meeting  in  San  Francisco.  Because  there  were  several  newer  members  of 
the  Joint  Board,  including  myself,  in  September,  we  hosted  a  2-day  meeting  at  the 
FCC  focusing  on  training.  We  heard  from  USAC,  NECA  and  FCC  Bureau  experts 
about  the  mechanics  of  the  Universal  Service  programs.  The  state  members  of  the 
Joint  Board  and  staff  met  again  in  November  2006  during  the  NARUC  meeting  in 
Miami.  The  full  Joint  Board  held  its  recent  en  banc  hearing  less  than  2  weeks  ago 
here in Washington, D.C. We were pleased that members of your staffs attended as 
well. 

We  continue  to  evaluate  the  issues  expressly  delegated  by  the  FCC  to  the  Joint 
Board for consideration, including what many call the ‘‘rural review’’ proceeding and 
the ‘‘basis of support’’ elements of the competitive ETC review. As a part of its anal-
ysis, the Joint Board is looking at ways to improve the distribution of high-cost Uni-
versal  Service  support.  Accordingly,  we  continue  to  evaluate  draft  proposals,  hear 
from  experts,  and  explore  solutions  that  will  help  sustain  the  benefits  of  the  Uni-
versal  Service  program  for  years  to  come.  As  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Board,  I  hope 
to  encourage  discussion  among  my  colleagues  and  facilitate  consensus  that  will  en-
sure that American consumers throughout the Nation continue to have access to an 
evolving level of innovative services. 

Although  the  Joint  Board  has  been  considering  several  options,  last  summer,  the 
Joint  Board  sought  public  comment  on  the  use  of  reverse  auctions  as  a  tool  to  im-
prove  the  distribution  of  high-cost  support.  On  August  11,  the  Joint  Board  issued 
a  Public  Notice  and  sought  comment  on  primary  questions,  such  as  the  overall  ap-
propriateness  and  legality  of  implementing  reverse  auctions,  as  well  as  questions 
about  the  mechanics  of  any  reverse  auctions,  such  as  Federal  and  state  jurisdic-
tional  roles,  quality  of  service  obligations,  and  the  unique  questions  regarding  the 
treatment  of  incumbent  local  exchange  carriers  (LECs).  The  Joint  Board  received 
numerous comments and reply comments last fall, and also received additional sub-
missions  in  the  record.  Further,  as  a  part  of  last  week’s  en  banc  hearing,  the  Joint 
Board heard experts, including witnesses from the National Telecommunications Co-
operative  Association,  Verizon,  and  CTIA—The  Wireless  Association   discussing 
specific  proposals,  benefits,  and  concerns  regarding  the  use  of  reverse  auctions.  We 
also  heard  from  experts  on  geo-spatial  mapping  and  more  targeted  approaches  to 
the  distribution  of  support  that  would  modify  our  current  programs,  including  wit-
nesses from the Polis Center in Indianapolis, CostQuest Associates, and Embarq TM. 
I am encouraged that you plan to hear from some of these same groups later today. 
I  think  it  is  important  to  understand  how  technological  change  in  the  industry 
is  impacting  the  policy  discussion.  The  communications  marketplace  continues  to 
evolve  daily,  as  convergence  shakes  the  foundations  of  the  old  order  for  industry, 
for  government,  and  for  consumers  alike.  While  this  convergence  creates  real  bene-
fits  for  consumers  through  the  introduction  of  exciting  new  services  and  increased 
competition among multiple service providers, it also challenges us to adapt our reg-
ulations to keep pace with these technological changes. 

The Joint Board continues to carefully evaluate the balance of issues at the inter-
section  where  the  policies  of  Universal  Service  and  competition  meet.  It  is  critical 
that we not lose sight of the Universal Service goals, as we look forward to ensuring 
that  an  evolving  level  of  communications  services  are  rolled  out  to  all  areas  of  the 
country. 

As we heard at the en banc, the area of greatest growth in the high-cost program 
relates to the increasing entry of competitive ETCs into rural areas. The fact is that 
overall  support  funding  for  incumbent  LECs  has  been  flat  or  decreasing  in  recent 
years.  On  the  other  hand,  we  have  witnessed  rapid  growth  in  the  funding  of 
CETCs—sometimes funding a second, third or more entrants in what have been de-
termined  to  be  high-cost  markets.  According  to  FCC  and  USAC  data,  competitive

ETC  funding  has  grown  from  $1  million  in  2000  to  $1  billion  in  2006.  If  this  con-
tinues at the present rate, CETC funding could double by funding year 2008. 

This growth is not only due to multiple providers receiving high-cost support, but 
also  because  CETCs  receive  Universal  Service  support  based  on  the  incumbent 
LEC’s  embedded  costs  or  the  per  line  support  amount  that  the  incumbent  LEC  re-
ceives.  But  as  we  heard  at  the  en  banc,  as  competitors  enter  areas  supported  by 
Universal Service high-cost funding, their actual costs are likely to be very different, 
often lower, than the incumbent telephone carrier’s costs on a per line basis. 

Discussion  of  this  issue  should  not  be  construed  as  critical  of  the  dazzling  array 
of  services  that  competitors,  including  wireless  providers,  are  bringing  to  the  rural 
areas  of  our  country.  Indeed,  wireless  services  have  added  a  new  dimension  to 
connectivity—mobility—that  is  very  important  to  many  consumers.  It  is  no  wonder 
that wireless telephone connections now far out strip the number of wireline connec-
tions—by  over  25  percent,  according  to  the  FCC’s  most  recent  figures.  I  have  men-
tioned  the  issue  to  you  in  detail  because  the  fact  is  that  the  growth  of  Universal 
Service  high-cost  support  is  easily  identified,  and  is  expected  to  continue  to  grow 
rapidly. 

As  we  look  ahead  to  the  long-term  goals  of  the  Universal  Service  program,  we 
must  balance  the  goal  of  encouraging  competitive  entry  with  the  other  challenges, 
such  as  the  further  deployment  of  advanced  services.  For  instance,  Alltel  recently 
filed  a  novel  proposal  to  allocate  funding  for  broadband  in  unserved  areas  through 
competitive bidding. It is essential that as the converging communications landscape 
changes, we recognize how technological changes are putting strains on the mechan-
ics of our contribution and distribution systems which must be addressed by policies 
that  avoid  subjecting  the  program  to  unsustainable  growth.  Like  you,  as  a  Federal 
official, we are stewards of these consumer dollars. While doing all we can to ensure 
that  affordable,  quality  services  are  available  to  consumers  all  across  the  country, 
we  must  do  so  in  a  way  that  is  sustainable  to  allow  new  generations  of  Americans 
to have access to the latest generation of services so that our country is able to com-
pete in the increasingly global economy. 

Again,  I  appreciate  your  invitation  to  be  here  with  you  today.  I  look  forward  to 
hearing from you today and in the future, and I will be pleased to answer any ques-
tions. 

Senator STEVENS. Well, thank you, Commissioner Tate. 
Our next witness is Commissioner Michael Copps, of the FCC. 

STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL J. COPPS, COMMISSIONER, 

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE 

Mr. COPPS. Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman, members of the Com-

mittee. 

I’m  pleased  to  visit  with  you  again  today  to  focus  on  the  chal-
lenge  of  how  to  bring  advanced  telecommunication  services  to  all 
of  our  citizens  and  to  ensure  that  our  Universal  Service  system, 
which  has  accomplished  so  much,  can  make  this  happen  in  a  sus-
tainable  way.  Each  and  every  citizen  of  this  great  country  should 
have  access  to  the  wonders  of  communications,  whether  they  live 
in rural areas, on tribal lands, or in our inner cities, whether they 
have  limited  incomes  or  disabilities,  whether  they  are  school-
children or rural healthcare providers. 

If we’re going to ensure that no community and no citizen is left 
behind by a lack of access to basic or advanced telecommunications 
in  this  new  digital  age,  we  need  to  make  some  changes.  We  must, 
first  of  all,  include  these  new  opportunity-creating  technologies  as 
part  of  our  Universal  Service  program.  In  plainer  English,  it  is 
time  to  bring  broadband  into  the  Universal  Service  system.  Then 
we  must  fine-tune  the  Fund.  We  must  broaden  the  USF  contribu-
tion  base.  We  must  make  sure  funds  are  distributed  with  max-
imum  equity  among  consumers,  areas,  and  technologies.  We  must 
fund  what  is  necessary  to  achieve  our  goal,  and  no  more.  And  we

must  appreciate  that  the  economies  of  nonrural,  rural,  and  truly 
remote service areas can be very different. 

If  we’re  going  to  broaden  the  purposes  of  Universal  Service,  we 
need  to  make  that  commitment  up  front.  USF  surely  cries  out  for 
changes in many aspects, but isn’t it better to get the mission clear 
before  we  do  a  lot  of  tinkering  around  the  edges?  I’m  not  sug-
gesting delaying the fine-tuning. I’m just suggesting the urgency of 
stating  the  message  and  the  mission.  It  strikes  me  that  first  you 
have  an  objective,  then  you  have  a  program.  A  USF  commitment 
to broadband strikes me as a pressing national need. Broadband is 
the  great  network  and  infrastructure  challenge  of  our  time,  just 
like canals and railroads and highways were in an earlier era. Our 
future will, in significant measure, be decided by how well we build 
our broadband connectivity in the digital age. 

So,  first  we  need  to  look  at  what  role  Universal  Service  should 
play in meeting this great infrastructure challenge. I recognize that 
the  process  of  incorporating  broadband  will  involve  complex  and 
difficult  choices  about  what  mix  of  technologies,  like  wireless  and 
copper-based,  and  fiber,  to  support,  and  how  to  support  them,  and 
over what time frame. And I don’t have a silver-bullet answer, but 
I’m  not  sure  anyone  else  does  either.  I  do  know  that  we  need  to 
confront  these  questions  in  a  forthright  and  honest  fashion.  We 
need to resolve them through a process that involves all the stake-
holders  in  this  important  issue.  That  surely  includes  the  state  au-
thorities,  like  the  experts  sitting  beside  me  here  today,  who  are 
such a fountain of creative and insightful ideas on the subject. And 
I  hope  the  FCC  will  play  a  more  proactive  role  in  the  effort,  not 
least  by  gathering  the  hard  data  that  is  absolutely  essential  for 
sound  policymaking,  doing  the  analyses,  and  teeing  up  options  for 
you and Congress to look at. You should push us to do more, much 
more, in this regard. 

We  also  need  direction  on  whether  Universal  Service  is  going  to 
be  ‘‘the’’  vehicle  or  ‘‘a’’  vehicle  in  a  comprehensive  national 
broadband  strategy,  because  such  a  strategy  might  involve  addi-
tional components, like matching grants or tax incentives. But this 
much  I  know:  we  simply  cannot  throw  up  our  hands  and  say  that 
there  shouldn’t  be  any  Federal  Universal  Service  support  for 
broadband. Unfortunately, in too may ways, that’s exactly what our 
approach to Universal Service does today. 

In  truth,  I  believe  that  Congress  already  gave  the  FCC  and  the 
states  a  statutory  mandate  to  bring  access  to  advanced  tele-
communications  to  each  and  every  citizen  of  this  country.  I’m  not 
sure,  however,  that  all  of  my  colleagues  on  the  Commission  agree 
that we have the authority to include broadband in universal serv-
ice, or even on whether doing so is the way to go; hence, the appar-
ent need for Congressional guidance. 

I realize much of our discussion today may be considerably more 
nitty-gritty  and  mechanics-oriented  than  what  I’ve  just  said.  We 
have  a  duty  to  deal  with  the  nuts  and  bolts  of  managing  the  pro-
gram  we  have  today.  So,  permit  me,  quickly,  to  propose  three 
things  that  I  think  could  be  done  immediately  to  put  Universal 
Service on a more solid footing so that it can be better deployed to 
help shape our future.

First,  with  boundaries  between  local  and  long  distance  eroding 
and  the  skyrocketing  success  of  any-distance  calling  plans,  assess-
ing  Universal  Service  contributions  only  on  interstate  services  is 
anachronistic.  While  it  will  require  a  legislative  fix,  I  believe  that 
assessing both intrastate and interstate revenues is a good idea. It 
would significantly lower the contribution factor and would expand 
the  base  of  future  funding  for  broadband  buildout,  if  that  is  the 
road you choose. 

Second,  it  is  as  clear  as  clear  can  be  that  the  costs  of  investing 
and  maintaining  wireless  and  wireline  infrastructure  are  inher-
ently  different.  I  believe  that  wireless  can  and  should  be  part  of 
Universal Service, but the time has come to put an end to the irra-
tional  and  costly  system  of  supporting  wireless  carriers  based  on 
the  cost  of  wireline  incumbents.  The  identical  support  rule  is  the 
subject  of  a  five  year  old  Joint  Board  referral.  I  believe  it  is  time 
for  the  Board  to  make  a  recommendation  to  the  full  Commission. 
Third,  I  believe  that  the  Universal  Service  system  cannot  thrive 
without  regular  review  and  care.  The  high-cost  fund,  like  many 
other  good  programs,  can  only  benefit  from  additional  oversight 
and  auditing  to  ensure  that  a  few  bad  actors  don’t  jeopardize  the 
strength of this great enabling program. 

The  Joint  Board  and  the  FCC  are  discussing  how  best  to  shore 
up  the  Fund.  Board  Chairman  Tate  and  our  state  colleagues  here 
this morning are working hard to develop recommendations for the 
Commission.  Our  state  colleagues  on  this  morning’s  panel  are 
among  the  Nation’s  leading  experts  on  Universal  Service.  They 
have  put  creative  ideas  before  the  Joint  Board  and  the  Commis-
sion.  And  Commissioner  Tate  and  I  may  well  be  asked  to  vote  on 
these ideas in the months ahead. 

Last  week,  the  Joint  Board  held  a  valuable  en  banc  hearing  ad-
dressing  some  of  the  issues  we  will  be  discussing  this  morning.  I 
would like to at least see some recommendations come forth in the 
next few months. And, by way of suggestion, I would hope that fu-
ture  referrals  from  the  Commission  would  contain  some  time  limi-
tations for Board action. The USF can do great things for America. 
It  can  help  ensure  that  often  unserved  areas  of  our  country  are 
connected  to  vital  education,  public  health,  public  safety,  employ-
ment,  and  business  opportunities,  but  we  do  not  have  the  luxury 
of time to get this right, because the rest of the world has no inten-
tion of waiting for us. 

So, thank you for holding this hearing. I look forward to our con-
versation  today  to  see  how  we  can  best  maintain  a  robust  and  ef-
fective  and  forward-looking  Universal  Service  system  that  remains 
true to its essential mission and true to the mission of our country. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Copps follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL J. COPPS, COMMISSIONER, 

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 

Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chairman,  members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  pleased  to 
visit  with  you  again  today  to  focus  on  one  of  the  most  important  challenges  con-
fronting  this  Committee,  our  Commission  and  the  country.  This  is  the  challenge  to 
bring  advanced  telecommunications  to  all  our  citizens  and  to  ensure  that  our  Uni-
versal  Service  system,  which  has  accomplished  so  much,  can  make  this  happen  in 
a sustainable way. Since I went to the FCC nearly 6 years ago, my overriding objec-
tive  has  been  to  help  bring  the  best,  most  accessible  and  cost-effective  communica-

tions  system  in  the  world  to  all  our  people—and  I  always  underline  the  ‘‘all.’’  Each 
and every citizen of this great country should have access to the wonders of commu-
nications—whether  they  live  in  rural  areas,  on  tribal  lands,  or  in  our  inner  cities; 
whether  they  have  limited  incomes  or  disabilities;  whether  they  are  schoolchildren 
or rural healthcare providers. 

If  we  are  going  to  ensure  that  no  community,  no  citizen,  is  left  behind  by  lack 
of  access  to  basic  or  advanced  telecommunications  in  this  new  digital  age,  we  need 
to think anew, adjust our policies and craft the proper incentives. We must include 
these  new  opportunity-creating  technologies  as  part  of  our  Universal  Service  pro-
gram.  In  plainer  English,  it  is  time  to  bring  broadband  into  the  Universal  Service 
system.  We  must  also  update  and  broaden  the  USF  contribution  base.  We  must 
make sure funds are distributed with maximum equity among consumers, areas and 
technologies.  And  we  must  recognize  that  the  economics  of  non-rural,  rural  and 
truly remote service areas are fundamentally different. 

Permit  me  to  begin  by  emphasizing  the  importance  of  an  USF  commitment  to 
broadband  because  this  is,  far  and  away,  the  most  meaningful  step  we  can  take  to 
create opportunity for our citizens, to ensure community development in every area 
of our country and to keep our Nation competitive in the global economy. Broadband 
is  the  great  network  and  infrastructure  challenge  of  our  time.  If  you  double  back 
through the years of this Nation’s history, you will find that just about every forma-
tive era has had its own major infrastructure challenge. Go back to the very begin-
ning as settlers pushed into the frontier and populated new lands. Their infrastruc-
ture challenge was to develop ways to deliver their produce and products to increas-
ingly far-away markets. So they found ways to build roads and turnpikes and canals 
and  ports  to  meet  that  challenge.  Later,  as  we  industrialized,  the  need  was  to  lay 
a  railway  grid,  first  across  regions  and  then  across  the  country,  climaxed  by  the 
great  saga  of  the  Transcontinental  railroads  as  we  became  a  continental  power  fol-
lowing  the  Civil  War.  Closer  to  our  own  era,  in  the  Eisenhower  years  as  suburbs 
grew  and  our  demography  changed,  came  the  Interstate  Highway  System  binding 
the  country  more  closely  together.  We  saw  it  in  communications,  too,  in  extending 
telephone service to rural America with the Rural Electrification amendments under 
Harry  Truman  and  with  the  Universal  Service  Fund  that  we  are  gathered  here  to 
discuss  this  morning.  In  all  of  these  infrastructure  build-outs,  there  was  a  critical 
role  for  government,  business  and  local  community  organizations  to  work  together 
toward  a  great  national  objective.  This  is  really  the  American  Story.  It’s  how  we 
built  our  Nation  and  how  we  grew.  It  is,  I  believe,  the  only  way  we  will  continue 
to grow it. 

From where I sit, broadband networks are the canals and railroads and highways 
of the digital age. Our future will be in significant measure decided by how we mas-
ter, or fail to master, advanced communications networks and how quickly and how 
well we build out broadband connectivity. 

So  first  we  need  to  look  at  what  part  Universal  Service  should  play  in  meeting 
this  great  infrastructure  challenge.  I  recognize  that  the  process  of  incorporating 
broadband  into  Universal  Service  will  involve  many  complex  and  difficult  choices 
about  what  mix  of  technologies—like  wireless,  copper-based,  and  fiber—to  support, 
how to support them, and on what time frame. I certainly don’t have a silver bullet 
answer  here  today,  and  I  am  not  sure  that  anyone  else  does  either.  But  I  do  know 
that we need to confront these questions in a forthright and honest fashion, and we 
need  to  resolve  them  through  a  process  that  involves  all  the  stakeholders  in  this 
important issue. That surely includes the state authorities, like those sitting beside 
me  here  today,  who  are  a  fountain  of  creative  and  insightful  ideas  on  this  subject. 
I hope the FCC will play a more proactive role in this effort—not least by gathering 
the hard data that is absolutely essential to sound policymaking, doing the analysis 
and teeing up options for Congress to consider. We also need to make sure that deci-
sions  about  Universal  Service  are  part  of  a  complete  national  broadband  strategy, 
which might involve additional components such as matching grants and tax incen-
tives.  More  than  anything  else,  I  know  that  we  simply  can’t  throw  up  our  hands 
and  say  that  there  shouldn’t  be  any  Federal  Universal  Service  support  for 
broadband.  Yet  in  too  many  ways  that  is  exactly  what  our  approach  to  Universal 
Service does today. 

In  truth,  I  believe  that  Congress  already  gave  the  FCC  and  the  states  the  statu-
tory  mandate  to  advance  the  cause  of  bringing  access  to  advanced  telecommuni-
cations to each and every citizen of our country. I’m not sure, however, that all my 
colleagues on the Commission agree that we have the authority to be more proactive 
in  encouraging  broadband  deployment  and  penetration,  and  this  is  why  I  am  hope-
ful that Congress will choose to make this clear for all of us to understand. 

Earlier this year I was fortunate enough to meet a small business owner who was 
able  to  work  out  of  his  home  on  a  rural  hilltop  on  the  Big  Island  of  Hawaii  after

broadband service was installed—rather than trekking each day to the nearest town 
miles  away  to  get  online.  And  not  too  long  ago  I  visited  an  Inuit  village  in  Alaska, 
totally unreachable by road, where a sick child with an ear infection could be exam-
ined  by  a  doctor  hundreds  of  miles  away.  In  another  Alaskan  village,  students  had 
used  their  broadband  connection  to  speak  in  real  time  with  the  crew  of  the  Inter-
national Space Station. Like a string wrapped around a finger, stories like these re-
mind us that lives and livelihoods and our very health are hugely influenced by the 
communications infrastructure available to us. 

As  we  work  on  implementing  these  lofty  concepts,  we  must  also  of  course  deal 
with  nitty-gritty  of  administering  the  program  we  have  today.  Permit  me  propose 
three  things  that  I  believe  could  be  done  immediately  to  put  Universal  Service  on 
a more solid footing so that it can be better deployed to shape our future. First, with 
boundaries  between  local  and  long  distance  eroding,  and  the  skyrocketing  success 
of  any-distance  calling  plans,  assessing  Universal  Service  contributions  only  on 
interstate  services  is  anachronistic.  While  it  will  require  a  legislative  fix,  I  believe 
that  assessing  both  intrastate  and  interstate  revenues  is  a  good  idea.  Second,  it  is 
as  clear  as  clear  can  be  that  the  costs  of  investing  and  maintaining  wireless  and 
wireline  infrastructure  are  inherently  different.  I  believe  that  wireless  can  and 
should  be  a  part  of  Universal  Service,  but  the  time  has  come  to  put  an  end  to  the 
irrational  and  costly  system  of  supporting  wireless  carriers  based  on  the  cost  of 
wireline  incumbents.  The  identical  support  rule  is  the  subject  of  a  5-year  old  Joint 
Board  referral;  I  believe  it  is  high  time  for  the  Board  to  make  a  recommendation 
to  the  full  Commission  so  we  can  take  corrective  action.  Finally,  I  believe  that  the 
Universal  Service  system  cannot  thrive  without  regular  review  and  care.  The  high- 
cost fund, like many other good programs, can only benefit from additional oversight 
and  auditing  to  ensure  that  a  few  bad  actors  do  not  jeopardize  the  strength  of  this 
great enabling program. 

The Joint Board and the FCC are in the midst of a serious debate on how to best 
shore  up  the  Universal  Service  Fund  and  how  it  can  meet  the  changing  needs  of 
the  country  as  we  head  into  the  21st  century.  Board  Chairman  Tate  and  our  state 
colleagues  here  this  morning  are  hard  at  work  developing  recommendations  for  the 
Commission. Our state colleagues on this panel are among the Nation’s leading ex-
perts on Universal Service. They have put creative ideas before the Joint Board and 
Commissioner  Tate  and  I  may  well  be  asked  to  vote  on  these  ideas  in  the  months 
ahead. Last week, the Joint Board held a valuable en banc hearing addressing some 
of  the  issues  we  will  be  discussing  today.  I  continue  to  urge  my  colleagues  that  we 
act quickly and deliberately to address the rising demands on Universal Service. All 
of  us  want  this  system  to  work.  None  of  us  wants  our  country,  or  anyone  in  it,  to 
miss the opportunities of the digital age. None of us wants to see any kind of digital 
gap  anywhere  in  America.  But,  truth  is,  if  we  don’t  get  our  policies  right,  we  could 
experience a 21st Century Digital Gap, in spite of the wonder of all these new tech-
nologies,  greater  than  the  one  we  experienced  with  plain  old  telephone  service  in 
the last century. The USF can do great things for America. It can help ensure that 
often  unserved  areas  of  our  country  are  connected  to  vital  education,  public  health, 
public safety, employment, and business opportunities. But we don’t have the luxury 
of  time  to  get  this  right  because  the  rest  of  the  world  isn’t  planning  on  waiting  for 
us. 

I  look  forward  to  our  conversation  today  to  see  how  we  maintain  a  robust,  effec-
tive,  and  forward-looking  Universal  Service  System  that  remains  true  to  its  essen-
tial mission and true to the mission of our country. 

Thank you for your attention and for holding this hearing today.

of  a  small,  but  highly  innovative,  rural  company,  as  President  of 
OPASTCO. 

Senator  Stevens,  I  bring  you  special  greetings  from  the  city  of 
your  birth,  Indianapolis.  I  also  had  the  privilege  of  visiting  your 
state  last  year,  and  had  a  chance  to  experience  firsthand  the 
unique challenges and opportunities which both traditional and ad-
vanced communications hold out for the people of Alaska. 

I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  address  the  critical  issues  re-
lating to Universal Service from the perspective of the Joint Board 
and the perspective of state regulators. 

I  want  to  underscore  that  I  do  not  necessarily  represent  the 
views  of  all  state  regulators,  which,  like  those  of  this  body,  some-
times diverge. 

Given time constraints, I’d like to start by referencing the March 
2,  2006,  testimony  of  my  colleague,  North  Dakota  Public  Service 
Commission  Chairman  Tony  Clark,  almost  exactly  a  year  ago 
today,  on  behalf  of  NARUC.  His  observations  are  still  relevant. 
Today,  we  speak  more  about  the  distribution  side  of  Universal 
Service.  However,  I  do  want  to  acknowledge  the  bipartisan  effort 
which went into framing a solution to funding of Universal Service, 
which  was  incorporated  into  the  proposed  Communications  Act  of 
2006 last year, and, as Commissioner Tate has already mentioned, 
is  incorporated  into  a  freestanding  bill  and  other  legislation  again 
this year. The latitude which you incorporated into that plan, from 
a funding perspective, was useful, commendable, and, I believe, en-
joys broad support from state regulators. 

I want to limit my remarks about the important issue of the sig-
nificant  growth  in  the  size  of  the  high-cost  fund.  I  share  the  opin-
ion  of  my  colleagues  on  the  need  for  a  cap  on  expenditures  to  give 
us  breathing  room  to  address  the  issues  in  a  more  comprehensive 
manner.  It’s  critically  important  to  the  sustainability  of  the  pro-
gram and to its continued place on the public policy agenda. Chair-
man Martin has spoken to the issue forcefully. And my Federal and 
State  colleagues  have  addressed,  and  will  address,  that  issue  here 
today. 

In considering reform, we would do well to take a page from the 
Hippocratic  Oath  and  first  resolve  to  do  no  harm.  Given  the  size, 
scope,  and  complexity  of  the  current  mechanisms,  this  is  a  consid-
erable challenge. For example, high-cost loop support for rural com-
panies is currently determined based on legacy investments; or, put 
another  way,  embedded  costs.  We  need  only  look  to  Detroit  to  see 
the  problems  which  legacy  decisions  can  present  for  companies 
looking  to  move  into  the  21st  century  and  to  compete  with  compa-
nies  which  are  not  saddled  with  those  decisions;  decisions  which 
seemed  appropriate  at  the  time,  but  now  may  create  a  challenge, 
a  significant  burden  of  competitive  disadvantage.  So,  we  need  to 
encourage  companies  to  look  to  the  future  rather  than  to  a  legacy 
past. But if we decide to sever those links to a legacy past, we also 
have  a  responsibility  to  offer  a  reasonable  migration  path  to  those 
companies  which  have  based  their  business  plans  on  that  model, 
which we now may consider less relevant. 

Another example may be found in the challenge presented by the 
growth in the number of competitive ETCs, primarily wireless com-
panies.  The  FCC’s  guidelines  on  CETC  designations,  adopted  in

2005 in response to a recommendation of this Board, define criteria 
and  urge  states  to  apply  a  public-interest  standard.  In  Indiana, 
we’ve  taken  this  challenge  seriously.  Other  states  have  chosen  a 
more permissive approach or, as is the case in North Dakota, were 
restricted in their ability to review ETC applications by a court de-
cision.  Those  2005  guidelines  should  be  made  mandatory,  and,  as 
states, we need to assume our share of responsibility. 

At  the  same  time,  there  are  many  rural  areas  where  multiple 
wireless  providers  are  active,  where  there  is  already  competition. 
We  need  to  make  sure  that  we  don’t  inadvertently  advantage  one 
company  over  the  others  which  entered  that  market  based  on  a 
competitive unsubsidized model. 

Lurking  just  around  the  corner  is  the  question  of  broadband 
buildout. The problem is that there is relatively little granular data 
which  would  tell  us  what  form  and  how  much  should  be  devoted 
to  buildout  in  those  high-cost  and  very  high-cost  areas.  Commis-
sioner  Copps  has  spoken  to  the  need  for  better,  more  robust  data, 
and I share and echo his concern. 

I  believe  that  states  have  an  important  and  potentially  growing 
partner  role  with  the  FCC  as  joint  stewards  in  implementing  your 
vision  and  seeing  to  it  that  Universal  Service  funds  are  appro-
priately disbursed, the legitimate needs are met, but that account-
ability and performance are audited and demanded. 

Again, I thank you for the privilege of sharing our thoughts with 
you  this  morning.  I  look  forward  to  any  questions  you  may  have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. LARRY S. LANDIS, COMMISSIONER, 

INDIANA UTILITY REGULATORY COMMISSION 

Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  Co-Chairman  Stevens,  and  members  of  the  Com-
mittee.  I  am  Larry  Landis,  and  I  am  a  member  of  the  Indiana  Utility  Regulatory 
Commission. I serve on the Telecommunications Committee of the National Associa-
tion of Utility Regulatory Commissioners, NARUC, and was Vice Chair of NARUC’s 
Intercarrier  Compensation  Task  Force.  I  am  also  a  member  of  the  Federal-State 
Joint  Conference  on  Advanced  Telecommunications  Services;  and  most  pertinent  to 
today’s  hearing,  a  member  of  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service. 
Thank you for the opportunity to address the critical issues relating to Universal 
Service  from  the  perspective  of  state  regulators.  I  want  to  underscore  that  I  do  not 
necessarily  represent  their  views,  which  like  those  of  this  body,  sometimes  diverge. 
Given  today’s  time  constraints,  I  would  start  by  referring  you  back  to  the  March 
2,  2006  testimony  of  my  colleague  Tony  Clark,  Chairman  of  the  NARUC  Tele-
communications Committee and of the North Dakota Public Service Commission, be-
fore this Committee almost exactly a year ago today. Commissioner Clark’s observa-
tions then are still relevant today. 

Commissioner  Clark  characterized  Universal  Service  as  being  at  a  crossroads. 

Among the questions he posed: 

• Should broadband infrastructure and services be explicitly funded? 
• What is the optimal size of the Fund and does it need to be capped? 
• Should it fund competition in high-cost markets? 
• How many networks should be funded in high-cost markets? 
• On what cost basis should carriers be reimbursed? 
• How many access lines per customer—or household—should be funded? 
• Is it intended for networks or for individuals? 
• Should  contributions  be  pegged  to  network  usage,  use  of  numbers,  connections 
• Should  Universal  Service  continue  to  be  a  shared  Federal-State  responsibility, 

or some other methodology? 

or is there some other configuration which makes sense?

Today  we  speak  more  about  the  distribution  side  of  Universal  Service.  However, 
I  do  want  to  acknowledge  the  bipartisan  effort  which  went  into  framing  a  solution 
to  funding  of  Universal  Service  which  was  incorporated  into  the  proposed  Commu-
nications Act of 2006 last year, and which I understand is incorporated into a free- 
standing  bill  again  this  year.  The  latitude  which  you  incorporated  into  that  plan 
from  a  funding  perspective  was  useful,  commendable,  and  I  believe  enjoys  broad 
support from state regulators. 

I will limit my remarks about the important issue of the significant growth in the 
size  of  the  high-cost  funds.  I  share  the  opinion  of  my  colleagues  on  the  need  for  a 
cap on expenditures to give us breathing room to address the issues in a more com-
prehensive  way.  It  is  critically  important  to  the  sustainability  of  the  program  and 
to  its  continued  place  on  the  public  policy  agenda.  Chairman  Martin  has  spoken  to 
this  issue  forcefully  and  my  Federal  and  state  colleagues  have  addressed  and  will 
address that issue here today. 

In considering reform, we would do well to take a page from the Hippocratic oath 
and first resolve to do no harm. Given the size, scope and complexity of the current 
mechanisms, that is a considerable challenge. 

For  example,  high-cost  loop  support  for  rural  companies  is  currently  determined 
based  on  legacy  investments,  or  put  another  way,  embedded  costs.  We  need  only 
look to Detroit to see the problems which legacy decisions can present for companies 
which  are  looking  to  move  into  the  21st  century  and  to  compete  with  companies 
which  are  not  saddled  with  those  decisions.  Those  decisions  seemed  appropriate  at 
the time, but now create a significant burden of competitive disadvantage. 

Increasingly,  facilities-based  competition  is  coming  to  many  rural  local  exchange 
companies. It is coming not only in the form of mobile wireless, but also VoIP deliv-
ered by cable modem, fixed wireless and broadband over power lines. But that com-
petition is taking root primarily in the villages, communities, towns and small cities 
in  those  rural  service  areas.  Often  it  doesn’t  reach  out  to  the  ‘‘truly  rural’’  areas 
served by rural LECs. 

We  need  to  encourage  incumbents—indeed,  all  providers—to  look  to  the  future 
rather  than  to  a  legacy  past.  But  if  we  decide  to  sever  those  links  to  a  legacy  past 
for the RLECs, we also have a responsibility to migrate those companies which have 
based  their  business  plans  on  a  model  which  we  may  now  consider  less  relevant. 
And we need to focus support in those areas where the costs are higher by an order 
of magnitude, and which in many cases are not contestable. 

Another  example  may  be  found  in  the  challenge  presented  by  the  growth  in  the 
number  of  competitive  ETCs,  primarily  wireless  companies.  Some  will  assert  that 
this  growth  is  symptomatic  of  the  problems  of  Universal  Service.  Others  will  argue 
that  this  is  a  reflection  of  the  dynamic  growth  of  the  wireless  sector.  Regardless, 
the  wireless  sector  has  been  the  primary  contributor  to  growth  in  the  high-cost 
funds. 

Under  Section  214(e)  of  TA  96,  State  Commissions  are  delegated  to  help  admin-
ister the Universal Service Fund by designating those companies which are eligible 
to  receive  support  (Eligible  Telecommunications  Carriers,  or  ETCs)  in  each  state. 
The FCC’s guidelines on ETC designations and certifications, adopted in 2005 in re-
sponse  to  a  recommendation  of  this  Board,  define  criteria  and  urge  states  to  apply 
a public interest standard. 

In Indiana, we have taken this charge seriously by fully adopting these guidelines 
and applying them to each new ETC applicant and each ETC who seeks annual cer-
tification for Federal Universal Service Funds. Other states have chosen a more per-
missive  approach  or—as  is  the  case  in  North  Dakota—were  restricted  in  their  abil-
ity  to  review  ETC  applications  by  a  court  decision.  Those  2005  FCC  guidelines 
should  be  made  mandatory,  and  as  states  we  must  shoulder  our  share  of  responsi-
bility. 

At  the  same  time,  there  many  rural  areas  where  multiple  wireless  providers  are 
active.  Some  companies  have  entered  some  rural  markets  based  at  least  in  part  on 
the assumption that they could receive Universal Service support. Other companies 
have  entered  rural  markets  based  on  a  competitive,  unsubsidized  model.  One  pro-
posal  would  hold  reverse  auctions  in  those  areas  where  there  are  multiple  wireless 
ETCs,  with  wireless  ETC  funding  distributed  on  a  winner-take-all  basis.  Where 
there  is  already  competition,  we  need  to  make  sure  we  don’t  inadvertently  advan-
tage  one  company  over  its  competitors,  which  entered  that  market  based  on  their 
assumption that it was contestable. Put another way, we need to make sure we are 
not  inadvertently  making  it  more  difficult  to  compete,  thereby  perhaps  reducing 
competition while reforming Universal Service subsidies. 

Lurking  just  around  the  corner  is  the  question  of  rural  broadband  buildout.  The 
problem  is  that  there  is  relatively  little  granular  data  which  would  tell  us  which 
of  several  solutions  would  be  most  cost-efficient  in  addressing  the  needs  of  the

unserved in any given geographical area. Once we know that, we are in a far better 
position  to  determine  what  form  and  how  much  should  be  devoted  to  buildout  in 
those high-cost and very high-cost areas. 

Where  will  tax  abatements  be  sufficient  incentive  to  encourage  buildout?  Where 
are  costs  so  high  that  only  a  straight  subsidy  will  work?  In  the  latter  cases,  where 
the market isn’t there, who will choose which technology is selected, and how large 
should the subsidy be? Commissioner Copps has spoken to the need for better, more 
robust data, and I share his concern. 

I  believe  the  states  have  an  important  and  potentially  growing  partner  role  with 
the FCC as joint stewards in implementing your vision, and in seeing to it that Uni-
versal  Service  funds  are  appropriately  deployed,  that  legitimate  needs  are  met,  but 
that accountability and performance are audited and demanded. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Commissioner Landis. 
And now, may I call upon a member of the Vermont Public Serv-

ice Board, the Honorable John D. Burke. 
STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN DOWNES BURKE, BOARD MEMBER, 
VERMONT  PUBLIC  SERVICE  BOARD;  MEMBER,  FEDERAL- 
STATE  JOINT  BOARD  ON  SEPARATIONS;  AND  MEMBER, 
FEDERAL-STATE JOINT BOARD ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE 
Mr.  BURKE.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice 
Chairman,  members  of  the  Committee.  Thank  you  for  giving  us  a 
chance to express to you our views, our beliefs, our desires, and our 
hopes for the Fund, going forward. 

There’s no doubt that the stated purpose of the Universal Service 
Fund,  as  stated  in  section  254(b)(3),  was  to  provide  comparable 
services  at  comparable  rates  to  the  higher-cost  areas  of  America.  I 
certainly  hope  that  as  we  go  forward  we  try  to  remember  that  is 
the primary goal that all of us have in mind. 

The task becomes daunting. And one of the main reasons it’s be-
come daunting is in order to try to further that goal, the Fund has 
become substantially larger and more inclusive than it might have 
been originally anticipated to be. There’s a slide and a graph, that 
we  also  used  at  the  en  banc  meeting,  that  gives  you  an  idea  of 
where the pressure on the Fund really presently comes from. 

Commissioner Tate mentioned the fact that there is a substantial 
growth  in  the  CETC  side  of  the  Fund,  the  competitive  side  of  the 
Fund.  If  you  look  at  that  growth,  you  can  see  that  it’s  risen  to  an 
amount of almost a billion dollars. The idea of the growth in CETC 
does not end there. There are estimates and reasonable projections, 
part of which were part of our en banc presentation, that would in-
dicate  that  by  2009  this  particular  portion  of  the  Fund  may  have 
risen  to  as  much  as  $2.5  billion,  making  the  Fund  no  longer  a  $4 
billion  project,  but  a  $6.5  billion  project.  It’s  the  challenge  of  all  of 
us—you,  as  legislators,  us,  as  members  of  the  Joint  Board,  recom-
mending  to  the  FCC,  and,  of  course,  the  FCC—to  do  what  we  can 
to  try  to  take  pressure  off  that  fund  to  the  point  that  we  are  able 
to  serve  the  people  that  need  to  be  served,  as  defined  in  254(b)(3), 
without getting to the point of the Fund getting so large that it im-
plodes on itself. 

The  graph—it’s  not  meant  to  be  exact;  obviously,  estimates  are 
estimates—but  you  can  see  that  the  pattern  of  growth  is  actually 
just following the trend that’s existed for the past 4 years, up until 
today, and going forward for the next 2. 

I also would like to take this opportunity to indicate that I have 
proposed a cap on the CETC side of the Fund, presumably with in-

flation adders to allow for the Joint Board and the Congress to con-
sider  alternatives  that  would  take  the  pressure  off  the  Fund  and 
still  allow  it  to  handle  its  intended  purposes  under  section 
254(b)(3).  I  would  hope  that  you  would  look  at  these  alternatives 
and work with us in formulating methods of going forward to both 
control the Fund and allow it to succeed. 

As we consider these alternatives, though, we should understand 
that  there  are  other  ideas  and  other  concerns  that  exist  with  re-
gard  to  supported  services  under  the  Fund.  I  agree  with  Commis-
sioner  Copps  that  broadband,  especially  in  rural  America,  those 
areas  that  are  harder  to  serve,  is  truly  a  crying  need.  In  my  own 
State,  although  it  would  appear  that  we’re  about  70-plus  percent 
served by broadband, truthfully we only have one really major met-
ropolitan area. If we remove Burlington from the mix, we really are 
less  than  50  percent.  For  people  today  in  rural  areas,  trying  to  do 
business on the web, or trying to make a living on the web, trying 
to  keep  informed  on  the  web,  broadband  is  truly  a  necessity,  and 
I really believe that, as a supported service, it could move forward. 
I  applaud  Senator  Stevens  for  his  idea  and  his  concerns  ex-
pressed  with  regard  to  broadband  in  his  bill.  I  think  that  we  have 
to  move  forward  in  broadband  in  ways  that  are  creative,  maybe 
with matching grants or in ways, with the states, that would allow 
the  states  to  help  target  those  areas  in  broadband  most  in  need, 
and  also  help  limit  the  size  and  the  pressure  on  the  Fund  by  hav-
ing  the  states  participate  with  a  matching  grant  program,  which 
would mean that they would be more likely to be targeting exactly 
the areas that are most in need, because their dollars would be in-
vested, as well. 

I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  have  addressed  you.  I  appre-
ciate  the  fact  that  you  have  us  here  today.  And  I  hope  that  all  of 
us move forward in a cooperative way to try to do what we can for 
those  areas  of  America  that  need  to  be  served  both  by  telephone 
service and by advanced services. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON.  JOHN DOWNES BURKE,  BOARD MEMBER,  VERMONT 
PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD; MEMBER, FEDERAL-STATE JOINT BOARD ON SEPARATIONS; 
AND MEMBER, FEDERAL-STATE JOINT BOARD ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE 

I. Introduction 

I thank the Committee for the invitation to speak today. Federal Universal Serv-
ice  policy  is  of  great  importance  to  the  Nation,  and  particularly  to  states,  like 
Vermont, where it is expensive to provide telephone service. 

To  introduce  myself,  I  have  been  a  Member  of  the  Vermont  Public  Service  Board 
for  6  years.  I  have  served  on  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Separations  since 
2003. Last year I was also appointed as a Member of the Federal-State Joint Board 
on  Universal  Service.  With  Commissioners  Baum  of  Oregon  and  Landis  of  Indiana, 
I have also served as one of five state NARUC Commissioners who oversaw the in-
dustry’s development of the current Missoula Plan. 
II. The Statute 

The existing Universal Service law, Section 254, was passed in 1996. It was a sig-
nificant  step  forward  in  establishing  universal  availability  of  telephone  services  in 
this  country.  Section  254  of  the  Act  repeatedly  imposes  the  duty  on  both  the  FCC 
and the Universal Service Joint Board to ‘‘preserve and advance’’ universal service.1 

1 See 47 U.S.C. § 254(b), 254(b)(4), 254(b)(5), 254(d), 254(f).

17 

More  specifically,  the  statute  lists  six  goals,  some  of  which  apply  primarily  to  dis-
tribution of Universal Service support, and some of which apply to collection. Nota-
ble  in  this  list  is  subdivision  (3),  which  requires  that  rural  ‘‘access  to  telecommuni-
cations  and  information  services,’’  including  ‘‘advanced  telecommunications  and  in-
formation  services’’  be  ‘‘reasonably  comparable  to  those  services  provided  in  urban 
areas.’’  It  also  requires  that  the  rural  rates  charged  be  ‘‘reasonably  comparable  to 
rates charged for similar services in urban areas.’’ 

Reasonably comparable rates is the heart of the high-cost support system, and the 
courts  have  taken  this  goal  seriously.  Twice,  the  Court  of  Appeals  in  Denver  has 
remanded  FCC  decisions  because  the  FCC  had  not  shown  how  its  programs  satisfy 
that goal.2 Developing a system in compliance with Section 254 should be an impor-
tant priority for the Joint Board and the FCC. 
A. Challenge—Competition and the Growth of CETCs 

The most urgent problem for Universal Service is the rapid growth of funding for 
competitive  telecommunications  carriers.  There  is  nothing  inherently  wrong  with 
providing support to competitors, but our current policy is on a self-destructive path 
that could jeopardize the entire Universal Service system, and it is my opinion that 
subsidizing robust competition was never an underlying goal of this Fund. 

Our  current  policy  was  adopted  to  promote  ‘‘competitive  neutrality,’’  a  seventh 
principle  that  the  first  Joint  Board  added  to  the  list  of  goals  for  universal  service. 
As  we  have  applied  it,  this  principle  has  led  to  the  ‘‘equal  payment’’  rule.  Under 
this  rule,  carrier  ‘‘A’’  who  is  an  Incumbent  Eligible  Telecommunications  Carrier 
(IETC),  and  carrier  ‘‘B,’’  who  is  a  Competitive  Eligible  Telecommunications  Carrier 
(CETC), receive equal support per line. This was seen as neutral, even though only 
carrier A must submit its costs. 

This  equal  payment  rule  was  originally  conceived  as  a  way  to  transfer  support 
when a CETC wins a customer from an IETC. Review of the record shows that the 
Joint  Board  did  not  anticipate  that  households  with  one  carrier  and  one  telephone 
line would begin to have two or more carriers and multiple cellphone lines in addi-
tion  to  the  classical  Plain  Old  Telephone  Service  (POTS)  line.  Today,  each  of  these 
lines may draw a quota of Universal Service support. 

The equal payment rule never acknowledged the effects of economies of scale, one 
of the basic characteristics of networks. When two carriers divide a market that pre-
viously  was  served  by  one,  the  total  cost  of  serving  that  area  can  go  up,  not  down, 
particularly  if  the  area  served  is  high-cost  and  rural.  As  Chairman  Martin  has  re-
peatedly  pointed  out,  our  current  policy  has  the  effect  of  supporting  construction  of 
multiple  networks  in  areas  where  constructing  the  first  network  has  been  very  ex-
pensive.  This  has  understandably  produced  explosive  growth  in  the  support  pro-
vided  to  Competitive  ETCs.  As  Commissioner  Tate’s  slides  show,  this  support  has 
been  growing  at  101  percent  per  year  for  the  last  4  years,  and  is  approaching  $1 
billion.  Moreover,  the  number  of  new  CETC  applications  suggests  the  growth  will 
continue  into  next  year  and  beyond.  Even  though  support  to  ILECs  has  held  fairly 
level  during  this  period,  rapid  CETC  growth  creates  risk  for  the  entire  Universal 
Service mechanism. 

I  have  recommended  an  immediate  CETC  cap  for  all  carriers  whose  support  de-
pends on the equal payment rule. I recommended that the cap apply by study area, 
so that areas without CETC support would remain that way until a new CETC sup-
port  system  is  devised.  In  areas  where  there  is  already  some  CETC  support,  that 
amount  would  be  divided  among  the  competitive  carriers  that  obtain  designations. 
Over  the  longer  term,  it  is  imperative  that  we  develop  clearer  policies  about  how 
we expect existing networks to be supported in high-cost areas, how many networks 
we are willing to support, and how they will be selected. 
B. Challenge—Uneven Support 

One  of  the  earliest  decisions  made  after  the  1996  Act  passed  was  to  create  sepa-
rate  ‘‘tracks’’  for  the  Universal  Service  provided  to  rural  and  so-called  ‘‘nonrural’’ 
carriers. That decision has continued to this day. 

Today,  rural  and  nonrural  carriers  have  largely  distinct  support  systems.  The 
mechanisms  differ  in  many  significant  ways,  but  the  overall  effect  is  that  support 
for larger nonrural carriers is significantly less than support for smaller ‘‘rural’’ car-
riers.  Today  the  average  rural  carrier  receives  $13.68  per  line  per  month  in  high- 
cost  support.  The  average  nonrural  customer  receives  66  cents  per  line  of  high-cost 
support,  and  most  of  that  goes  for  interstate  cost  and  not  for  local  rate  reductions. 
In sum, customers of large carriers receive about five cents of high-cost support for

every  dollar  paid  to  benefit  the  customer  of  rural  companies,  not  due  to  differences 
in need, but rather, to the size of the company that serves them. 

This would be fine if nonrural carriers had no rural customers. In fact, the match 
between ‘‘rural carrier’’ and ‘‘rural customer’’ works fairly well in the Midwest where 
there  are  hundreds  of  rural  companies.  But  the  equation  between  ‘‘rural  carrier’’ 
and ‘‘rural customer’’ does not work well in New England or in the Appalachian re-
gion, where Bell companies still serve large rural areas.3 In truth, millions of rural 
customers are served by larger carriers. Among the so-called ‘‘nonrural’’ companies, 
more than one customer in five is actually a rural customer.4 

The  problem  bites  most  deeply  in  states,  like  Maine,  Montana,  Wyoming  and 
Vermont, where there are no large cities that can subsidize rural areas through re-
tail rate averaging. These states suffer from a double disability: the absence of large 
cities  eliminates  the  possibility  of  averaging  high  and  low  cost  areas  to  develop 
lower average rates overall; and the absence of smaller ‘‘rural’’ telephone companies 
reduces the support available to rural customers. 

The disparity between rural and nonrural companies has only become worse over 
time.  Rural  customers  served  by  large  companies  today  are  not  only  likely  to  have 
higher rates, they probably have less access to broadband as well. 
C. Challenge—Broadband 

Broadband is probably the most important current challenge for universal service. 
Section  254  directs  that  access  to  advanced  services  should  be  provided  in  all  re-
gions of the Nation. Yet many states have large areas where broadband is available 
only  by  satellite.  It  has  been  widely  reported  that  the  United  States  is  falling  be-
hind, year by year, in the percentage of our citizens who buy broadband. 

The Joint Board should give serious consideration to adding broadband to the offi-
cial  list  of  supported  services.  Section  253  gives  us  detailed  guidance  for  this  deci-
sion.  The  statute  recognizes  that  ‘‘Universal  Service  is  an  evolving  level  of  tele-
communications services.’’ We must consider whether such broadband telecommuni-
cations  services  ‘‘are  essential  to  education,  public  health,  or  public  safety’’  and 
whether ‘‘a substantial majority of residential customers’’ have actually subscribed.5 
As  Consumer  Advocate  Gregg  has  pointed  out  to  us,  a  majority  of  residential  cus-
tomers may soon actually subscribe to broadband. 

One  possible  problem  is  that  Section  254  allows  us  to  add  only  ‘‘telecommuni-
cations  services’’  to  the  existing  list  of  supported  services.  The  FCC  has  declared 
that several kinds of broadband Internet services are actually ‘‘information service,’’ 
not  ‘‘telecommunications  service.’’  So,  even  though  Section  254  tells  us  explicitly 
that  ‘‘access  to  advanced  telecommunications  and  information  services  should  be 
provided  in  all  regions  of  the  Nation,’’  we  will  need  to  examine  carefully  whether 
these FCC rulings bar use of Section 254 as a vehicle to promote broadband. 

A  second  possible  problem  is  that  including  broadband  in  the  definition  of  Uni-
versal  Service  could  inadvertently  disqualify  some  existing  carriers  who  provide 
‘‘POTS’’  or  ‘‘Plain  Old  Telephone  Service.’’  Section  254  does  not  specifically  antici-
pate  allowing  funding  for  services  that  do  not  meet  the  minimum  requirements  for 
eligibility.  We  would  need  to  move  carefully  to  allow  existing  carriers  a  reasonable 
transition period to meet any new requirements. 

Another concern is that to include broadband in the definition of Universal Serv-
ice  could  greatly  expand  the  size  of  the  high-cost  fund.  This  is  a  serious  concern, 
but  we  should  not  assume  that  broadband  services  will  be  supported  in  the  same 
ways that we now support POTS. 

The Joint Board has recently sought comment on the use of auctions, and we are 
examining  the  potential  for  newer  technologies  to  better  target  existing  support.  I 
believe that we should also examine matching grants. Many Federal agencies, from 
Transportation  to  Education,  today  promote  good  state  policy  through  the  use  of 
such  matching  grants.  If  applied  to  broadband,  a  system  of  matching  grants  could 
easily be controlled fiscally by implementing an annual funding cap. Also, matching 
grants  would  be  most  likely  to  be  effective.  States  generally  know  the  most  about 
their own broadband needs, and a mechanism that required a state matching share 
would be very likely to focus support in areas where a problem really exists. 

Earlier this winter, Vermont Governor James Douglas outlined to our state legis-
lature  an  initiative  that  would  authorize  state  bonding  to  provide  broadband  in 

3 The converse problem also exists. A few so-called ‘‘rural carriers’’ actually serve low cost sub-

urbs.

unserved  areas.  A  Federal  matching  grant  for  broadband  deployment  would  allow 
us  to  stretch  our  limited  state  dollars.  It  would  greatly  assist  Vermont  and  other 
states  that  are  still  struggling  to  provide  a  first  broadband  connection  to  many  of 
their citizens. 

I  also  agree  with  Commissioner  Copps  that  data  quality  is  a  problem  for 
broadband.  Data  indicating  which  Zip  Codes  have  broadband  is  misleading.  Know-
ing  that  broadband  is  available  somewhere  within  a  zip  code  is  little  solace  to  an 
individual  customer  who  can’t  buy  it  from  anyone.  The  Joint  Board  should  be  col-
lecting  data  on  broadband  at  a  much  finer  scale  than  it  does  now,  and  the  tech-
nology clearly exists to do this. 
D. Challenge—Limiting Fund Size 

I have mentioned the need to equalize support for all rural customers and my de-
sire to expand support to broadband. I also want to emphasize that a rational Uni-
versal  Service  policy  can  achieve  these  goals  without  unduly  increasing  the  size  of 
the national Fund, possibly without increasing it at all. 

The  existing  Universal  Service  system  has  not  been  designed  as  a  single  system. 
Rather,  it  is  a  series  of  eight  separate  programs  that  were  created  incrementally 
over two decades.6 A few programs have been modified, but none has ever been re-
placed.  Each  new  program  typically  focused  on  some  cost  component  or  company 
characteristic  that  seemed  relevant  at  the  time.7 But  we  have  never  taken  a  com-
prehensive  and  multi-jurisdictional  view  of  carrier  costs,  and  we  have  never  re-
placed even one older program. 

Another problem with the existing system is that it provides the most support to 
the smallest companies, not necessarily those with the highest costs. The most obvi-
ous example today is Local Switching Support, which does not even attempt to limit 
support to carriers with high costs.8 

If  we  could  design  a  comprehensive  system,  we  could  adopt  a  single  definition  of 
total cost, and we could find new efficiencies by eliminating support to carriers that 
do not have high overall costs. 

As I mentioned above, matching grants can be another tool to maintain fiscal dis-
cipline. Federal matching programs in other policy areas routinely live within their 
budgets. 

For  these  reasons,  I  believe  that  the  existing  fund  size  could  be  reduced,  or  we 
could  broaden  the  scope  of  the  Fund  to  cover  broadband,  without  unduly  harming 
rate  payers  and  without  violating  any  of  the  principles  contained  in  Section  254(b). 
E. Challenge—Intercarrier Compensation and Separations 

I  mentioned  above  that  I  have  been  privileged  to  serve  on  both  Joint  Boards  and 
the  NARUC  Intercarrier  Compensation  project.  This  has  convinced  me  that  Uni-
versal  Service  is  intimately  tied  both  to  separations  and  to  intercarrier  compensa-
tion. 

6 The  first  Universal  Service  program  was  the  High  Cost  Loop  program,  and  was  created  in 

1984. 

7 For example, the High Cost Loop program addressed a 1984 change in the jurisdictional sep-
aration  of  loop  costs.  Today  this  program  exceeds  $1  billion,  but  there  is  no  similar  program 
for the interoffice transport costs of rural companies, costs that for some companies can be even 
larger than loop costs. Likewise, the Interstate Access Reform and Interstate Common Line Sup-
port  programs  were  created  in  2000  and  2001  to  replace  revenues  lost  through  reform  of  inter-
state toll access rates. 

8 This  support  mechanism  was  created  in  1987  when  the  FCC  made  a  change  affecting  the 
separation  of  costs  affecting  the  cost  recovery  for  local  ‘‘class  5’’  switches.  Originally  known  as 
‘‘DEM  weighting,’’  this  mechanism  allowed  ILECs  with  50,000  or  less  access  lines  to  allocate 
a higher percentage of their local switching costs to the interstate jurisdiction. The greatest ben-
efit  went  to  ILECs  that  already  had  the  largest  interstate  usage  and  to  the  ILECs  that  had 
the fewest lines, according to the following table.

See 47 C.F.R. § 36.125(f ). While the FCC’s rules for this program no longer explicitly differen-
tiate based upon size, the program’s 1996 support parameters were frozen in place by a reformu-
lation  that  took  effect  on  January  1,  1998,  thereby  indefinitely  perpetuating  the  size-based  dis-
tinction. See 47 C.F.R. § 36.125(f ).

Separations  has  had  a  particularly  close  historical  relationship  to  universal  serv-
ice.  Before  1996,  Universal  Service  programs  were  enacted  in  the  form  of  separa-
tions  rules.  Although  these  programs  were  designed  to  reduce  or  avoid  an  increase 
in  local  rates,  they  acted  through  separations  rules  and  created  inter-jurisdictional 
cost transfers that ultimately raised interstate access and toll rates.9 Even more re-
cent programs, like the High Cost Modeling Program that applies to larger carriers, 
rely on separations factors to avoid the double-recovery of costs that have been sepa-
rated to the interstate jurisdiction.10 

Universal service also has a close historical relationship to intercarrier compensa-
tion.  Several  Universal  Service  programs  were  created  solely  as  components  in 
intercarrier  compensation  reforms.  For  example,  the  CALLS  program,  adopted  by 
the  FCC  in  May  of  2000,  reformed  interstate  access  rates  for  large  ‘‘price  cap’’  car-
riers.  The  following  year,  2001,  the  Commission  adopted  the  ‘‘MAG’’  order  that  did 
essentially  the  same  thing  for  smaller  ‘‘rate-of-return’’  carriers.  Each  order  created 
a  new  Universal  Service  mechanism.  This  year  those  programs—‘‘Interstate  Access 
Support’’ and ‘‘Interstate Common Line Support’’—will cost $1.9 billion. 

The  current  version  of  the  Missoula  Plan,  now  pending  before  the  Commission, 
would  add  another  layer.  It  proposes  additional  FCC  payments  of  $2.5  billion  to  fi-
nance  the  reform  of  new  kinds  of  intercarrier  payments,  such  as  intrastate  access 
and reciprocal compensation. 

The  close  interaction  among  these  programs  shows  why  two  Joint  Boards  some-
times  find  it  difficult  to  identify  comprehensive  solutions.  One  can  seldom  make  a 
recommendation on any of the three topics without affecting the other two. Perhaps 
Congress should consider a new and more comprehensive mechanism for cooperation 
between the FCC and the states, particularly in policy areas requiring coordination 
of rates and cost assignments. 
F. Improving the Uses of USF Dollars 

Some  carriers  have  criticized  the  existing  support  mechanisms  for  being  insuffi-
ciently  specific  geographically.  I  agree  that  more  detailed  targeting  of  support  for 
competitive  carriers  could  possibly  increase  their  investment  in  underserved  areas. 
However, I think the Joint Board and the states have adequate tools now to address 
this  issue.  The  Joint  Board  is  looking  at  proposals  from  industry  that  would  man-
date greater disaggregation of existing support, with this result in mind. 

We  should  not  forget  that  states  already  have  some  tools  to  encourage  carriers 
to  invest  in  unserved  areas.  States  annually  must  certify  the  proper  use  of  Uni-
versal  Service  support.  These  certifications  offer  states  a  chance  to  review  where 
Federal  funds  have  been  spent,  and  some  states  have  required  detailed  investment 
plans as a condition of annual certification.11

STATEMENT OF HON. BILLY JACK GREGG, DIRECTOR, 

CONSUMER ADVOCATE DIVISION, 

PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF WEST VIRGINIA 

Mr.  GREGG.  Thank  you.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice 

Chairman, members of the Committee. 

As  you’ve  heard  from  the  other  speakers  before  me,  there  is 
amazing agreement amongst the members of the Joint Board as to 
what the current problems are with the high-cost fund. The current 
system  is  unsustainable.  It’s  inconsistent,  and  incredibly  complex. 
It’s growing out of control. It’s distributed poorly. 

The sad fact is that the advent of competition into telecommuni-
cations has actually caused a substantial increase in the size of the 
high-cost  fund,  as  you’ve  seen  visually  on  the  slides  presented  by 
Commissioner  Tate.  This  has  increased  the  burden  on  all  con-
sumers, and it didn’t have to be this way. 

As  noted  in  both  the  House  and  Senate  reports  on  the  Tele-
communications Act of 1996, competition was supposed to lower the 
cost  of  Universal  Service  as  providers  competed  for  the  Universal 
Service  subsidy.  The  FCC  initially  kept  true  to  the  intent  of  the 
Act.  Universal  Service  high-cost  support,  as  modified  by  the  Com-
mission  for  the  advent  of  competition,  was  a  technologically  and 
competitively  neutral  zero-sum  game.  That  is,  the  Universal  Serv-
ice  subsidy  was  portable  to  whichever  eligible  telecommunications 
carrier  won  the  customer.  The  ETC  gaining  the  customer  won  the 
subsidy.  The  ETC  losing  the  customer  lost  the  subsidy.  The  Com-
mission’s  approach  was  upheld  by  the  Fifth  Circuit  Court  of  Ap-
peals  in  the  case  of  Alenco  Communications  versus  the  FCC  in 
2000. 

Unfortunately,  without  explanation,  the  Commission  abandoned 
its rulemaking proceeding to define ‘‘captured’’ and ‘‘new lines’’ and 
deleted  a  section  of  its  rules  which  had  reduced  support  to  an  in-
cumbent when a competitive ETC won a customer. As a result, the 
Commission began providing support for all lines of all ETCs serv-
ing high-cost areas. 

In 1999, this did not seem like a big deal. Unfortunately, the un-
foreseen  consequences  of  these  actions  have  been  dramatic.  By  de-
ciding to support all lines of all ETCs in high-cost areas, the Com-
mission  opened  the  door  to  supporting  multiple  wireless  networks 
in high-cost areas, which supplied supplementary, rather than sub-
stitute,  services.  Far  from  being  a  zero-sum  game  in  which  ETCs 
compete  for  the  Universal  Service  subsidy  while  the  size  of  the 
Fund  stays  relatively  the  same,  the  current  system  is  a  no-losers 
support system in which all ETCs receive support for all lines they 
serve  in  high-cost  areas,  no  matter  how  duplicative  or  costly  this 
additional support may be. 

Under the current system, far more than affordable access to the 
telecommunications  network  is  being  provided.  The  high-cost  fund 
now  provides  support  to  multiple  networks  in  high-cost  areas,

22 

where,  previously,  none  had  been  able  to  exist  without  an  explicit 
subsidy.  The  current  system  of  providing  support  to  all  lines  of  all 
ETCs in high-cost areas must be ended if we are to have a rational 
and  sustainable  high-cost  support  system.  In  fact,  when  multiple 
providers  are  able  to  offer  service  within  the  same  area,  it  raises 
the  question  of  whether  that  area  should  continue  to  receive  high- 
cost  support  at  all.  Because  of  the  complex,  disparate,  and  often 
unrelated bases of the different high-cost support mechanisms, and 
the rapidly escalating size of the high-cost fund caused by increas-
ing  payments  to  competitive  ETCs,  the  Joint  Board  has  begun  to 
look  at  new  alternatives  to  bring  rationality  back  to  the  high-cost 
fund, as you have heard this morning. 

Unfortunately,  while  we  contemplate  these  proposals,  the  Fund 
will continue to grow to an ever more unsustainable size. The high- 
cost  fund  has  increased  by  a  billion  dollars,  as  you’ve  heard,  over 
the past 3 years, driven by new payments to competitive ETCs. In 
addition,  the  FCC  currently  has  before  it  pending  over  30  applica-
tions  for  ETC  status  from  wireless  carriers,  including  two  from 
Cingular  for  the  states  of  Virginia  and  Georgia.  Cingular  is  the 
largest  wireless  provider  in  the  United  States.  The  FCC  has  esti-
mated  that,  if  it  grants  all  of  the  ETC  applications  pending  before 
it  today,  the  high-cost  fund  will  rise  to  five  and  a  half  billion  dol-
lars  by  2009.  And  if  Cingular  continues  to  seek  ETC  status, 
Verizon  Wireless,  the  second  largest  wireless  provider,  will  be 
forced to follow suit. The result will be a high-cost fund surpassing 
$6  billion  and  approaching  $7  billion.  A  fund  of  this  size  will  not 
only  impose  unacceptable  burdens  on  American  consumers,  it  will 
also  severely  limit  our  ability  to  add  new  services,  such  as 
broadband,  to  the  list  of  services  supported  by  Universal  Service. 
In  order  to  be  stable  and  sustainable  in  the  long-term,  the  Uni-
versal  Service  Fund  must  be  configured  like  a  pyramid.  It  must 
have  a  broad  and  stable  base  of  contributions  at  the  bottom  and 
a narrow, but sufficient, distribution of support at the top. The cur-
rent  Universal  Service  Fund  requires  work  on  both  ends  of  the 
structure. Issues related to the contribution base must be resolved. 
Since  all  benefit  from  Universal  Service,  all  should  contribute.  In 
addition,  the  limited  resources  of  the  Fund  must  be  properly  dis-
tributed and targeted to carry out the purposes of the Act. In order 
to continue the public policy success of the Universal Service Fund, 
we must support access, not excess. 

Thank you very much.

fore  state  and  Federal  courts.1 I  am  a  former  member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of 
the  Universal  Service  Administrative  Company  (USAC)  and  the  Rural  Task  Force, 
and have served on the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service since March 
2002.  I  greatly  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  testify  at  this  legislative  hearing  on 
the  challenges  currently  facing  the  Federal  Universal  Service  Fund  (USF  or  the 
Fund). 
I. Background 

The  most  important  issue  facing  the  Federal  USF  today  is  adapting  the  Fund  to 
a  competitive  environment  and  ensuring  its  long-term  sustainability.  As  the  tele-
communications market changes rapidly, we must ensure that the USF is sufficient, 
predictable  and  affordable  for  all  parties  involved:  fund  recipients,  telecommuni-
cations  providers  and  consumers.  Before  I  address  the  current  problems  facing  the 
USF, I believe it is appropriate to review the Fund’s achievements since the passage 
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the Act). 

The  nation’s  commitment  to  Universal  Service  was  codified  in  Section  254  of  the 
Act.  The  purpose  of  Section  254  was  to  ensure  that  all  Americans  have  access  to 
affordable,  quality  telecommunications  services.2 Based  upon  the  requirements  of 
Section 254, the FCC, after consultation with the Federal-State Joint Board on Uni-
versal  Service,  created  a  new  Federal  USF  in  1997  containing  several  distinct  sup-
port mechanisms. Total USF funding has grown from $1.8 billion in 1997 to approxi-
mately  $7.2  billion  during  2007.  While  these  support  amounts  are  large,  they  must 
be kept in perspective. Total telecommunications revenues in the United States last 
year  were  in  excess  of  $230  billion.  By  annually  collecting  and  redistributing  ap-
proximately 3 percent of these total revenues, we are able to: provide affordable ac-
cess  to  phone  service  in  all  high-cost  areas  of  the  nation;  support  low-income  cus-
tomers; assist rural healthcare providers; and connect all classrooms to the Internet. 
Moreover,  all  states  and  territories  benefit  from  the  USF  as  shown  on  Attachments 
1  and  2.3 That’s  quite  an  accomplishment,  and  one  that  everyone  involved  in  the 
USF  should  be  proud  of  as  we  move  forward  to  ensure  the  long-term  sustainability 
of the Fund. 

However,  as  with  all  things,  somebody  must  pay  for  the  Fund’s  benefits.  That 
somebody  is  the  American  telecommunications  consumer  in  every  state  and  terri-
tory.  Although  all  states  benefit  from  the  USF,  some  states  pay  far  more  into  the 
Fund  than  they  receive  back  in  support,  as  shown  on  Attachments  3  and  4.4 The 
concept  of  sustainability  encompasses  both  the  size  of  the  Fund  and  the  relative 
burden it imposes. In order to ensure that the USF is sustainable for the long-term, 
we  must  ensure  that  the  USF  remains  affordable  for  the  individual  consumer  and 
for the payer states. As I will discuss in detail later, the biggest threat to the long- 
term  sustainability  of  the  USF  is  the  burden  imposed  by  the  unrestrained  growth 
of the High Cost Fund. 
II. The Long Term Sustainability of the Universal Service Fund 

As previously mentioned, the Federal USF has grown from $1.8 billion to $7.2 bil-

which is paid by all local, long distance and wireless customers in the United States 
based  on  interstate  revenues,  has  more  than  doubled,  from  less  than  5  percent  to 
over 11 percent.5 Almost everyone who addresses the issue of the long-term sustain-
ability  of  the  USF  has  the  same  prescription:  broaden  the  contribution  base  and 
properly control the distribution of funds from the USF. However, depending on the

universal  service,  as  well  as  consumers  who  must  pay  the  cost  of  Universal  Service.  In  most 
respects, my testimony reflects the positions taken by NASUCA, although there are some areas 
where NASUCA has not yet reached a consensus position.

followed by the FCC for decades.

eral  USF  support  mechanisms.  Attachment  1  ranks  the  states  based  on  total  support  received. 
Attachment  2  considers  the  number  of  access  lines  in  each  state,  and  ranks  the  states  based 
on monthly support received per line. 

4 Attachments 3 and 4 show the same disbursements as Attachments 1 and 2, but also include 
the USF payments made by consumers in each state during 2005. Attachment 3 ranks the states 
based on total net support received, while Attachment 4 ranks the states on net per line support 
received.  Negative  numbers  indicate  that  states  paid  more  in  USF  assessments  than  they  re-
ceived in USF benefits. 

5 The  assessment  factor  was  9.7  percent  during  the  first  quarter  of  2007  and  is  expected  to 

rise above 11 percent for the second quarter.

interest  group  making  the  recommendation,  the  actual  method  of  broadening  the 
base and controlling the distribution of funds can vary wildly. 

The FCC and Congress have wrestled with the issue of the funding base for over 
4  years.  Although  numerous  ideas  and  proposals  to  broaden  the  contribution  base 
have been brought forth, none have been implemented. Many parties oppose broad-
ening  the  contribution  base  on  the  grounds  that  it  will  only  lead  to  more  profligate 
spending  of  money  paid  into  the  USF.  I  am  firmly  convinced  that  unless  we  first 
bring  the  distribution  of  the  High  Cost  Fund  under  control,  no  progress  will  be 
made on the contribution side. 

In looking at the long-term sustainability of the Fund, we need to review the sta-
tus  of  funds  paid  out  by  the  individual  support  mechanisms  which  make  up  the 
overall  USF.  A  quick  review  of  the  four  funds  making  up  the  Federal  USF—the 
High  Cost  Fund,  the  Low  Income  Fund,  the  Schools  and  Libraries  Fund,  and  the 
Rural  Health  Care  Fund—shows  that  the  High  Cost  Fund  is  the  most  problematic. 
Set forth below are the collections for each of these funds in 2003 and projected for 
2007.6

As  can  be  seen,  the  High  Cost  Fund  has  grown  by  over  a  billion  dollars  since 
2003, while the other funds have shown modest or negative growth in the same pe-
riod.  The  Schools  and  Libraries  Fund  has  been  capped  at  $2.25  billion  a  year  since 
its inception. The Rural Health Care Fund has likewise been capped at $400 million 
a year, although annual expenditures have come nowhere near that level. The Low 
Income  Fund  has  been  the  focus  of  repeated  state  and  Federal  efforts  to  increase 
participation,  yet  funding  has  not  grown  substantially  over  the  past  4  years.  The 
High  Cost  Fund  is  clearly  the  main  driver  in  the  growth  in  the  overall  Fund  and 
the USF contribution factor. 

Within  the  High  Cost  Fund,  support  for  competitive  eligible  telecommunications 
carriers  (ETCs),  and  more  particularly  wireless  carriers,  has  been  the  sole  cause  of 
growth  since  2003.  As  shown  below,  payments  to  competitive  ETCs  have  soared 
from $126.7 million in 2003 to $1.2 billion projected for 2007.7

While  USF  support  payments  to  competitive  ETCs  have  increased  tenfold,  pay-

Payments to rural incumbents have been held in check by a cap on the High Cost 
Loop Fund. This cap does not apply to competitive ETCs. Payments to non-rural in-
cumbents  have  been  limited  by  loss  of  lines  and  a  ceiling  on  the  Interstate  Access 
Support Fund. 

It should not be surprising that funding for competitive ETCs has increased. After 
all,  before  the  advent  of  competition  incumbents  received  100  percent  of  high-cost 
funding. It was expected that as competitors gained ETC status and won customers 
in high-cost areas, their high-cost funding would rise. What is surprising is that in-
cumbent  support  has  not  dropped  by  an  amount  proportionate  to  the  increase  in 
competitive  ETC  funding.  In  other  words,  the  advent  of  competition  has  actually

caused  a  substantial  increase  in  the  size  of  the  High  Cost  Fund,  and  increased  the 
burden on all consumers. It did not have to be this way. 
III. Competition and the Universal Service Fund 

It  has  often  been  said  that  the  twin  pillars  of  the  1996  Telecommunications  Act 
were competition and universal service. Competition would allow consumers to enjoy 
lower  prices  and  better  services,  while  Universal  Service  would  ensure  that  all 
Americans, even those in rural and high-cost areas, would share in the benefits. Not 
only  was  the  introduction  of  competition  expected  to  lower  prices  of  telecommuni-
cations services, it was supposed to lower the cost of Universal Service as providers 
competed  for  the  Universal  Service  subsidy.  As  the  House  and  Senate  Reports  on 
the Act stated: 

. . .  as  the  current  system  of  internal  and  external  subsidies  is  replaced  by  a 
system consisting primarily of external subsidies, the total amount of subsidies 
collected  from  low-cost  customers  and  passed  on  to  high-cost  customers  would 
not change significantly. Over time, CBO [Congressional Budget Office] expects 
that  the  operating  costs  of  telephone  companies  would  tend  to  fall  as  a  result 
of competitive pressures and the total amount of subsidies necessary would de-
cline.9 
. . . competition and new technologies will greatly reduce the actual cost of pro-
viding  Universal  Service  over  time,  thus  reducing  or  eliminating  the  need  for 
Universal Service support mechanisms as actual costs drop to a level that is at 
or below the affordable rate for such service in an area. . . .10 

This view was echoed by Senator Stevens during debate on the Act: 

[The  Act]  opens  up  the  local  market  to  competition  while  still  preserving  the 
concept of universal service. It does so by taking advantage of new technologies 
which are intended to reduce the cost of all services, including universal service. 
In  fact,  I  find  it  interesting  that  the  Congressional  Budget  Office  has  said  that 
this  bill  will  reduce  the  cost  of  Universal  Service  from  the  existing  system  by 
at least $3 billion over the next 5 years.11 

The  High  Cost  Fund  began  in  a  monopoly  environment  prior  to  the  passage  of 
the Act. Since 1996 the FCC has struggled to adapt the USF to a competitive envi-
ronment  where  multiple  providers  could  offer  the  same  or  similar  services  to  con-
sumers.  In  implementing  the  Universal  Service  provisions  of  the  Act,  the  FCC  ini-
tially kept true to the Act’s intent. In the First Report and Order on Universal Serv-
ice, the Commission described its overall approach to universal service: 

. . .  Universal  Service  will  be  sustainable  in  a  competitive  environment;  this 
means  both  that  the  system  of  support  must  be  competitively  neutral  and  per-
manent, and that all support must be targeted as well as portable among eligi-
ble  telecommunications  carriers. . . .  By  following  the  principle  of  competitive 
neutrality, we will avoid limiting providers of Universal Service to modes of de-
livering that service that are obsolete or not cost effective.12 

The  Commission  also  dealt  directly  with  the  issue  of  which  ETC  would  receive 

high-cost support: 

We  adopt  the  Joint  Board’s  recommendation  to  make  rural  carriers’  support 
payments  portable. . . .  [A]  CLEC  [competitive  local  exchange  carrier]  that 
qualifies as an eligible telecommunications carrier shall receive Universal Serv-
ice  support  to  the  extent  that  it  captures  subscribers  formerly  served  by  carriers 
receiving  support  based  on  the  modified  existing  support  mechanisms  or  adds 
new  customers  in  the  ILEC’s  study  area.  We  conclude  that  paying  the  support 
to  a  competitive  eligible  telecommunications  carrier  that  wins  the  customer  or 
adds a new subscriber would aid entry of competition in rural areas. [Emphasis 
added.] 13 

In  short,  Universal  Service  high-cost  support,  as  modified  by  the  Commission  for 
the advent of competition, was a technologically and competitively neutral ‘‘zero sum

game:’’  the  Universal  Service  subsidy  was  portable  to  whichever  ETC  won  the  cus-
tomer. The ETC gaining the customer won the subsidy, the ETC losing the customer 
lost the subsidy. As part of this framework, the Commission revised its rules to add 
Section 54.307(a)(4) which stated: 

The  amount  of  Universal  Service  support  provided  to  such  incumbent  local  ex-
change carrier shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount provided to 
such competitive eligible telecommunications carrier.14 

The  Commission  stated  that  this  rule  change  was  necessary  to  ensure  that  when 
a  competitive  ETC  received  support  for  a  customer,  ‘‘. . .  the  incumbent  LEC  will 
lose  the  support  it  previously  received  that  was  attributable  to  that  customer.’’ 15 
The Commission’s approach was upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in the 
case of Alenco Communications, Inc. v. FCC: 

The  FCC  must  see  to  it  that  both  Universal  Service  and  local  competition  are 
realized;  one  cannot  be  sacrificed  in  favor  of  the  other.  The  Commission  there-
fore  is  responsible  for  making  the  changes  necessary  to  its  Universal  Service 
program to ensure that it survives in the new world of competition. 
. . .  [T]he  [FCC’s  universal  service]  order  provides  that  the  Universal  Service 
subsidy  be  portable  so  that  it  moves  with  the  customer,  rather  than  stay  with 
the  incumbent  LEC,  whenever  the  customer  makes  the  decision  to  switch  local 
service  providers.  . . .  The  purpose  of  Universal  Service  is  to  benefit  the  cus-
tomer,  not  the  carrier.  ‘‘Sufficient’’  funding  of  the  customer’s  right  to  adequate 
telephone service can be achieved regardless of which carrier ultimately receives 
the subsidy.16 [Emphasis in original.] 

. . . 

Unfortunately,  in  November  1999,  without  explanation  the  Commission  aban-
doned its rulemaking proceeding to define ‘‘captured and new lines’’ and deleted Sec-
tion  54.307(a)(4)  of  its  rules  which  had  reduced  support  to  an  incumbent  when  a 
competitive  ETC  won  a  customer.17 Finally,  in  April  2000,  the  Commission  effec-
tively abandoned the distinction between ‘‘new,’’ ‘‘captured,’’ and ‘‘other’’ lines served 
by  ETCs,  stating  ‘‘. . .  a  competitive  eligible  telecommunications  carrier  receives 
support  for  each  line  it  serves  based  on  the  support  the  incumbent  local  exchange 
carrier would receive for serving the line.’’ 18 

The unforeseen consequences of these actions have been dramatic. By deciding to 
support  all  lines  of  all  ETCs  in  high-cost  areas,  the  Commission  opened  the  door 
to  supporting  multiple  wireless  networks  which  supplied  supplementary,  rather 
than  substitute  services.  As  previously  discussed,  this  supplementary  support  to 
wireless  ETCs  has  added  a  billion  dollars  to  the  High  Cost  Fund  since  2003.19 Far 
from being a ‘‘zero sum game’’ in which ETCs compete for customers while the size 
of  the  Fund  stays  relatively  the  same,  the  current  system  is  a  ‘‘no  losers’’  support 
system in which all ETCs receive support for all lines they serve in high-cost areas, 
no matter how duplicative or costly this additional support may be.20 

Under  the  current  system,  far  more  than  affordable  access  to  the  telecommuni-
cations  network  is  being  provided.  The  High  Cost  Fund  now  provides  support  to 
multiple  networks  in  high-cost  areas,  where  previously  none  had  been  able  to  exist 
without a subsidy. If a customer in a high-cost area receives two landlines from the 
incumbent  wireline  ETC,  and  three  wireless  phones  from  a  competitive  ETC,  all  of 
these lines receive high-cost support. Even more bizarre, if the rural incumbent ETC 
actually  loses  lines,  support  for  both  the  incumbent  ETC  and  the  competitive  ETC 
will go up as a result of the equal support rule.21 The result has been a rapid esca-

lation of support as competitive ETCs have rushed in to take advantage of the rules 
created by the FCC. 

One  outrageous  example  of  the  current  system  is  found  in  the  AT&T  (BellSouth) 
service  territory  in  Mississippi.  AT&T  as  the  incumbent  non-rural  carrier  receives 
$101.2  million  in  High  Cost  Support  annually.  In  addition,  there  are  sixteen  (16) 
other  competitive  ETCs  receiving  $118.5  million  in  High  Cost  Support  annually  for 
providing service in the same study area.22 Most of this CETC support goes to wire-
less  ETCs,  including  $59.1  million  to  AT&T’s  wireless  subsidiary,  Cingular.  While 
there is no doubt that Mississippi is a high-cost area, the Act’s requirement to pro-
vide  affordable  access  does  not  require  providing  subsidies  to  multiple  networks 
serving  the  same  customers.  The  current  system  of  providing  support  to  all  lines 
of all ETCs in high-cost areas must be ended if we are to have rational and sustain-
able high-cost support system. 

Because of the complex, disparate and often unrelated bases of the different high- 
cost  support  mechanisms,  and  the  rapidly  escalating  size  of  the  High  Cost  Fund 
caused  by  increasing  payments  to  competitive  ETCs,  the  Joint  Board  has  begun  to 
look  at  new  alternatives  to  bring  rationality  back  to  the  High  Cost  Fund.  One  of 
these  proposals  is  reverse  auctions;  another  is  newer,  more  sophisticated  modeling 
and more precise targeting of support based on new mapping technology. These pro-
posals  will  need  much  work  before  it  is  determined  if  they  are  ready  to  be  imple-
mented on a national or even a pilot project scale. 

Unfortunately,  while  we  contemplate  these  proposals,  the  Fund  will  continue  to 
grow  to  an  ever  more  unsustainable  size.  The  High  Cost  Fund  has  increased  by  $1 
billion over the past 3 years driven by new payments to competitive ETCs. In addi-
tion,  the  FCC  currently  has  pending  before  it  over  thirty  (30)  applications  for  ETC 
status from wireless carriers, including two from Cingular for the states of Virginia 
and  Georgia.  The  FCC  has  estimated  that  if  it  grants  all  of  the  ETC  applications 
pending today, the High Cost Fund will rise to $5.5 billion by 2009. If Cingular, the 
largest wireless carrier, continues to seek ETC status, Verizon Wireless, the second 
largest, will be forced to follow suit. The result will be a High Cost Fund surpassing 
$6 billion and approaching $7 billion. A fund of this size will not only impose unac-
ceptable  burdens  on  American  consumers,  but  will  severely  limit  our  ability  to  add 
new services, such as broadband, to the list of services supported by universal serv-
ice. 

As  a  result,  the  Joint  Board  is  currently  considering  several  proposals  to  cap  the 
High  Cost  Fund  while  we  consider  long-term  solutions  on  how  to  adapt  the  Uni-
versal  Service  system  to  the  new  competitive  environment  by  properly  targeting 
support and ensuring that the Fund does not grow to an unsustainable size. In fact, 
one  of  the  difficulties  confronting  policymakers  in  this  area  is  the  lack  of  any  up-
ward  limit  on  the  Fund  expressed  by  Congress.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  in  the 
currently  pending  S.  101,  the  Universal  Service  for  Americans  Act,  Section  202  cre-
ates  a  $500  million  a  year  Broadband  for  Unserved  Areas  Program.  This  is  similar 
to funding under the existing cap on the Schools and Libraries Fund. Moreover, Sec-
tion 202 makes clear that distributions from the Broadband fund may only be made 
to  one  facilities-based  broadband  provider  in  each  unserved  area.  Based  on  the 
wording  of  Section  202,  policymakers  know  exactly  how  much  they  have  to  spend, 
and can then attend to the issues of how to equitably distribute the Fund in accord-
ance  with  the  principles  established  by  Congress.  While  a  limitless  Universal  Serv-
ice  Fund  may  have  made  sense  when  we  were  faced  with  making  previous  implicit 
subsidies explicit, eleven years after the passage of the Act it may be time for Con-
gress to also express its opinion on the ultimate size of the High Cost Fund. 
IV. The Contribution Base 

Ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Fund will require not only controlling 
the  size  and  distribution  of  the  fund,  but  also  broadening  the  contribution  base. 
Moreover,  until  the  distribution  and  sizing  issues  are  solved,  it  is  not  likely  that  a 
consensus will develop concerning how to address the contribution base. 

The funding base for the USF has not kept pace with the growth in the fund, re-
sulting in higher and higher USF assessments on carriers and their customers. The 
contribution  base  problem  stems  in  large  part  from  the  wording  of  the  Act  itself. 

gardless of the number of lines served, the loss of lines by the incumbent will increase per line 
support, all other things being equal.

Section  254(b)(4)  states  that:  ‘‘All  providers  of  telecommunications  services  should 
make  an  equitable  and  nondiscriminatory  contribution  to  the  preservation  and  ad-
vancement  of  universal  service.’’  However,  Section  254(d)  states:  ‘‘Every  tele-
communications  carrier  that  provides  interstate  telecommunications  services  shall 
contribute on an equitable and non-discriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, 
and  sufficient  mechanisms  established  by  the  Commission  to  preserve  and  advance 
universal  service.’’  In  other  words,  even  though  the  principle  set  forth  in  the  Act 
is  that  all  telecommunications  providers  should  contribute  to  the  fund,  and  even 
though  the  Fund  benefits  all  areas  of  the  country,  Section  254(d)  limits  the  obliga-
tion  to  support  the  Fund  to  a  subset  of  telecommunications  carriers—providers  of 
interstate telecommunications services.23 

In  1997  the  FCC  decided  to  base  the  funding  for  the  high-cost  and  low-income 
support  mechanisms  on  each  carrier’s  interstate  and  international  revenue,  while 
the  funding  for  schools  and  libraries  and  rural  health  support  mechanisms  were 
supported  by  assessments  on  all  revenues,  interstate  and  intrastate.  The  use  of 
intrastate revenues for USF assessment purposes was struck down by the Fifth Cir-
cuit  Court  of  Appeals  in  1999.24 Since  that  time  the  contribution  base  for  the  USF 
has  been  limited  to  only  interstate  and  international  revenues.  As  the  USF  has 
grown,  and  as  the  interstate  revenue  base  has  leveled  off,  the  assessment  rate  has 
increased rapidly. 

So  long  as  interstate  revenues  grew  at  a  reasonable  rate,  the  ultimate  impact  of 
fund  growth  on  the  USF  assessment  rate  and  customers’  bills  was  fairly  moderate. 
However,  beginning  in  2000  interstate  revenue  growth  began  to  flatten  out,  and 
during  2002  started  to  decline.  The  result  has  been  a  steep  escalation  in  the  USF 
assessment  rate,  from  5.7  percent  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2000  to  9.7  percent  in 
the  first  quarter  of  2007.25 Based  on  the  latest  projections  from  USAC,  the  assess-
ment factor for the second quarter of 2007 is likely to exceed 11 percent. 

There are several alternatives available in order to broaden the USF contribution 
base. One alternative would be to retain the current system, but remove restrictions 
in  current  rules  which  artificially  depress  the  existing  interstate  revenue  contribu-
tion  base.  One  such  restriction  is  the  so-called  ‘‘safe  harbors’’  which  limit  the  con-
tribution  responsibility  of  certain  classes  of  carriers,  such  as  wireless  carriers  and 
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) carriers. Another restriction limits the contribu-
tions  from  broadband  providers,  one  of  the  fastest  growing  areas  of  telecommuni-
cations.  Currently,  providers  of  broadband  are  exempt  from  paying  to  support  the 
USF.26 If the Commission includes broadband in the list of USF supported services, 
it is obvious that broadband providers should also contribute to the Fund. 

A  second  alternative  would  be  to  grant  the  FCC  the  authority  to  base  contribu-
tions to the Fund on total telecommunications revenues. Shown on Attachment 6 is 
a comparison of changes in the Universal Service Fund, the interstate revenue base, 
and  total  telecommunications  revenues  from  1997  to  2007.27 As  you  can  see,  total 
telecommunications  revenues  currently  amount  to  approximately  $230  billion  and 
would provide an adequate funding base for the USF. In fact, if total telecommuni-
cations  revenues  had  been  used  as  the  funding  base  from  the  start,  we  would  not 
be  discussing  this  issue  today.  The  growth  in  the  Fund  could  have  been  accommo-
dated while keeping the assessment rate around 3 percent. 

Use  of  total  revenues  would  also  eliminate  disputes  about  whether  revenues  are 
intrastate  or  interstate,  and  would  equitably  spread  the  obligation  to  support  Uni-
versal  Service  to  all  providers  and  to  all  customers  based  on  their  use  of  the  net-
work.  However,  basing  Federal  Universal  Service  on  total  revenues  would  require 
a  statutory  change  to  clarify  that  the  FCC  has  the  authority  to  base  contributions 
on  all  revenues,  intrastate  as  well  as  interstate.  In  addition,  a  total  revenues  base 
could  be  susceptible  to  erosion  in  the  future  as  more  and  more  traffic,  including 
voice traffic, migrates to the Internet and is classified as ‘‘information services,’’ cur-

state service. 

23 As  a  practical  matter,  virtually  all  telecommunications  carriers  provide  some  sort  of  inter-

24 Texas Office of Public Utility Counsel v. FCC, 183 F.3d 393 (5th Cir. 1999) at 448. 
25 These increases have been flowed through to most customers by means of line items. Begin-
ning  in  the  second  quarter  of  2003,  carriers  can  no  longer  mark  up  these  assessments,  but  can 
only flow through the assessment rate approved by the Commission. 

26 Digital  subscriber  line  service  (DSL)  providers  previously  paid  into  the  Fund,  but  were  ex-

empted by FCC action in 2006. 

27 On Attachment 6 USF Funding and the Interstate Revenue Base are taken from USAC re-
ports.  The  Total  Revenue  Base  is  taken  from  the  FCC’s  Trends  in  Telephone  Service  reports. 
The funding base for 1997 is estimated. Beginning in the second quarter of 2003, the USF fund-
ing base has been based on carriers’ projected revenue collections.

rently exempt from USF assessment.28 Finally, in order to prevent any uncertainty 
concerning  state  authority,  any  statutory  change  to  allow  assessment  of  total  tele-
communications  revenues  for  the  Federal  Fund  should  specify  that  states  have  the 
reciprocal  right  to  use  total  revenues  as  the  basis  for  assessments  for  state  Uni-
versal Service programs. 

A  third  alternative  would  be  to  base  assessments  on  connections  to  the  public 
switched  telephone  network,  or  on  assigned  telephone  numbers.  The  FCC  has  con-
sidered  several  such  proposals  over  the  past  few  years.  While  these  connection- 
based  or  numbers-based  proposals  do  enlarge  the  base  of  the  USF,  and  minimize 
problems with classification of services or revenues as information services, they do 
have several flaws: (1) each proposal radically shifts the funding of the USF among 
industry  groups;  (2)  each  proposal  appears  to  exempt  pure  providers  of  interstate 
long  distance  from  making  any  contribution  to  the  Fund  in  contravention  of  the 
plain wording of Section 254(d); (3) each proposal requires capacity-based connection 
equivalents  for  high-capacity  customers;  and  (4)  each  proposal  shifts  responsibility 
for payment of USF charges from high-use to low-use customers. 

A  final  alternative,  which  my  office  has  proposed  to  the  FCC,  would  be  a  hybrid 
of  the  proposals  described  above.  For  example,  the  Commission  could  continue  to 
base 50 percent of the Universal Service assessment on interstate revenues, and as-
sess  the  remaining  50  percent  on  end-user  connections  to  the  public  switched  net-
work.  Such  a  hybrid  would  not  require  a  statutory  change  and  would  ensure  that 
all  providers  of  interstate  services,  even  those  that  did  not  provide  end-use  connec-
tions, would continue to contribute to support universal service. In addition, this 50/ 
50  hybrid  approach  would  mitigate  impacts  on  low-usage  customers,  and  result  in 
contributions from various industry sectors that are very close to those produced by 
use of total telecommunications revenues. 

In this regard, I should note that Section 101(a) of the Universal Service for Amer-
icans Act is particularly helpful. Section 101(a) empowers the Commission to assess 
for  Universal  Service  based  upon  interstate  revenues,  intrastate  revenues,  connec-
tions,  numbers,  capacity  or  any  combination  of  these  methods.  In  short,  Section 
101(a) provides the Commission with a full set of tools to address different contribu-
tion circumstances that may arise as the telecommunications marketplace evolves.29 
Moreover, Section 101(a) also provides reciprocal flexibility for state commissions in 
assessing providers to support state Universal Service funds. 

In  finding  a  solution  to  the  contribution  base  problem,  I  agree  with  Senator  Ste-
vens of Alaska who has previously said: ‘‘All companies that use the network, in my 
judgment,  should  contribute  to  universal  service,  regardless  of  the  type  of  service 
they  provide.’’ 30 I  believe  we  must  expand  contribution  responsibility  to  encompass 
all revenues and all services that connect to the telecommunications network. Since 
all benefit, all should contribute. 
V. Conclusion 

In  order  to  be  stable  and  sustainable  in  the  long-term,  the  USF  must  be  config-
ured  like  a  pyramid:  it  must  have  a  broad  and  stable  base  of  contributions  at  the 
bottom,  and  a  narrow  but  sufficient  distribution  of  support  at  the  top.  The  current 
Universal Service Fund requires work on both ends of this structure. Issues related 
to  the  contribution  base  must  be  resolved.  Since  all  benefit,  all  should  contribute. 
In addition, the limited resources of the Fund must be properly distributed and tar-
geted  to  carry  out  the  purposes  of  the  Act.  In  order  to  continue  the  public  policy 
success of the Universal Service Fund, we must support access, not excess. 

28 It should be noted that the FCC already has the discretionary power under 254(d) to require 
contributions from any other provider of interstate telecommunications ‘‘if the public interest so 
requires.’’ 

29 For  this  same  reason,  I  oppose  Section  206  of  the  Universal  Service  for  Americans  Act, 
which  prohibits  the  use  of  primary  lines  in  distributing  support.  As  discussed  above,  the  major 
problem  confronting  the  Fund  currently  is  on  the  distribution  side.  Congress  should  broaden, 
not limit, the tools available to the Commission in addressing the problems of adapting the USF 
to competition.

STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

The  CHAIRMAN.  I  thank  you  very  much,  Director  Gregg.  And  I 

thank the panel very much. 

We will begin our questioning with Vice Chairman Stevens. 
Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman. 
You  haven’t  made  your  opening  statement.  Do  you  want  to  make 
the opening statement? 

The CHAIRMAN. It will be made part of the record. 
Senator STEVENS. I’ll make mine part of the record, too, then. 
[The  prepared  statements  of  Senators  Inouye  and  Stevens  fol-

low:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
Today’s hearing on Universal Service returns the Committee to familiar territory. 
Indeed,  it  was  just  over  a  decade  ago  that  we  created  Section  254  of  the  Commu-
nications Act, which provided the Federal Communications Commission with statu-
tory  authority  to  create  a  system  of  explicit  support  to  preserve  and  advance  the 
goals of universal service. 

While  it  may  be  familiar  territory,  today’s  Universal  Service  system  faces  new 
challenges, brought on by shifts in the way that Americans communicate and by the 
steady emergence of new communications platforms. 

Without  question,  when  it  comes  to  Universal  Service  reform,  we  face  a  difficult 
task  in  balancing  competing  equities  to  promote  the  goals  of  Universal  Service  in 
a  manner  that  will  achieve  a  fair  result.  These  issues  are  complicated,  and  radical 
solutions often promise more than they can deliver. 

If  we  are  to  move  forward  in  fashioning  a  system  that  is  both  flexible  enough  to 
adapt to changes in the marketplace and rock-solid in its commitment to promoting 
reasonably  comparable  communications  services  at  reasonably  comparable  rates, 
then  all  of  us—industry,  regulators,  and  Members  of  this  Committee—will  need  to 
roll  up  our  sleeves,  and  work  toward  proposals  that  will  result  in  meaningful 
progress and a firmer footing for the stability and sufficiency of the Universal Serv-
ice Fund. 

I  am  hopeful  that  today’s  hearing,  featuring  two  distinguished  panels,  will  begin 

this constructive discussion. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

I  would  like  to  thank  the  Chairman  for  scheduling  this  hearing.  Senator  Inouye 
has  been  a  great  leader  and  friend  with  respect  to  Universal  Service  ever  since  we 
began  working  together  to  achieve  the  same  phone  rates  in  Alaska  and  Hawaii  as 
in the rest of the country. 

As  communications  technologies  advance  and  evolve,  the  mission  of  Universal 
Service continues. The 1996 Telecommunications Act locked in certain aspects of the 
Universal  Service  program  that  made  sense  in  1996  but  that  now  need  to  be  revis-
ited. Chief among these is how the program is supported. 

Last  Congress,  this  committee  worked  in  a  bipartisan  fashion  to  reach  consensus 
on  how  to  update  Universal  Service  contributions  and  ensure  that  all  communica-
tions  carriers  are  covered.  S.  101,  the  USA  Act,  reflects  the  work  that  the  Com-
mittee  engaged  in  last  year.  This  would  result  in  a  more  rational  approach  with  a 
smaller fee on most consumer phone bills. For the elderly, who could have been dis-
proportionately  impacted,  we  created  an  exception.  The  bill  also  ensures  that  no 
technology  is  excluded  from  being  able  to  receive  Universal  Service  funds.  While 
there  seems  to  be  consensus  relative  to  Universal  Service  contributions,  there  are 
a number of issues before the FCC relative to distributions that do not yet have con-
sensus.  I  expect  that  we  will  hear  about  proposals  for  reverse  auctions  and  other 
ways  to  limit  Universal  Service  spending  today,  and  I  look  forward  to  that  discus-
sion. 

Fiscal controls are important, so long as they do not undercut Universal Service’s 
mission  to  deliver  communications  service  to  rural  America.  I  will  listen  today  to 
understand  how  any  proposal  ensures  that  the  network  costs  of  rural  carriers  will 
be  sufficiently  supported.  In  addition,  I  hope  witnesses  will  explain  what  mecha-
nisms  will  exist  to  allow  carriers  to  make  new  investment  to  bring  new  and  essen-

tial  services  to  rural  America.  Unless  these  and  other  concerns  are  addressed,  I  do 
not see how the FCC can move forward to implement some of these proposals. 

I  look  forward  to  working  with  my  colleagues  to  address  contribution  reform  in 
this  Congress,  and  to  better  understand  what  options  the  FCC  is  looking  at  to  ad-
dress the distribution methodology in a way that will not disadvantage rural Amer-
ica. 

Senator  STEVENS.  I  congratulate  the  panel.  You  really  have  pre-
sented the viewpoints of your own entities and yourselves on prob-
ably  the  most  difficult  problem  we  face.  And  it  does  seem  to  me 
that somehow or other we have to devise a way to have an adjust-
ment period to get back to the point where there is just one subsidy 
involved in these areas of very high cost. Has anyone got any idea 
how to do that? Now, you’ve heard my comments before. I think re-
verse auctions will just do no more than bring in national concerns 
that’ll absolutely wipe out all the local carriers who have pioneered 
these  lines  in  the  past,  which  I  think  is  very  unfair.  But,  on  the 
other  hand,  I  also  think  that  those  legacy  carriers  have  got  to  ad-
just,  and  they’ve  got  to  have  some  way  to  become  broadband  pro-
viders.  Some  of  you  have  suggested  that  that  be  on  the  basis  of 
grants.  So,  let  me  ask  all  of  you.  Would  you  envision  those  grants 
would come from the Fund? 

Mr.  BURKE.  I  think  I  was  probably  the  one  that  fired  that  idea, 
Senator.  And  the  way  I  had  envisioned,  to  this  point  in  time,  is 
that,  certainly,  the  Fund  could  be  used  as  the  vehicle.  I  felt  that 
a matching type of grant, using the states as the bellwether, would 
be  a  particularly  good  way  of  doing  it,  because,  number  one,  it 
would  give  the  states  an  incentive  to  be  targeting  extremely  well; 
and, number two, the states probably are the best vehicle to target. 
Whether or not it was through the Fund or through a separate en-
tity,  I  really  have  no  particular  opinion.  But  I  do  think,  if  you  did 
do it through the Fund, that a matching grant proposal at least has 
the  attraction  of  being  focused,  targeted,  and,  therefore,  limited  in 
scope  by  that  close  targeting,  in  conjunction  with  the  states,  and 
allow, therefore, the pressure on the Fund to be not undue. 

Mr. GREGG. Senator Stevens, I think that the approach that was 
set forth in the Universal Service for Americans Act, S. 101, section 
202,  which  set  up  the  broadband  fund  of  a  half  a  billion  dollars, 
was  the  appropriate  concept  that  we  could  use  for  the  high-cost 
fund,  as  well.  As  set  forth  in  section  202  of  the  Universal  Service 
for Americans Act, the support is limited to a single facilities-based 
provider  per  unserved  area.  That  is  a  rational  way  to  target  and 
maximize the benefit of that type of program. I would conceive that 
this broadband fund should be a part of the overall Universal Serv-
ice  Fund.  And  I  also  endorse  the  approach  given  by  Commissioner 
Burke; having the states have to pony up their own money, so that 
it’s a joint State-Federal effort to bring broadband to all Americans, 
I think, is a very good idea. 

Obviously,  policymakers  deciding  how  much  they  have  to  spend 
for  a  particular  policy,  and  establishing  principles  to  guide  its  dis-
tribution, is the way we’re used to working. One of the things that’s 
unusual  about  the  high-cost  fund  is,  there’s  no  limit.  That  might 
have  made  sense  in  1996,  when  we  knew  we  were  going  to  have 
to  make  implicit  subsidies  explicit,  but  11  years  down  the  road

now,  it  may  be  time  for  this  Congress  to  express  its  opinion  as  to 
what  upward  limit  there  should  be  on  the  high-cost  fund,  as  well. 

Senator STEVENS. What do you think about that, Mr. Copps? 
Mr. COPPS. I think if we’re going to go down that road of general 
grants,  which  is  not  a  bad  idea,  we  have  to  talk,  first  of  all,  about 
coordination with other programs that are out there, because we al-
ready  have  initiatives  like  Rural  Utility  Service  grants  and  things 
like  that,  so  there  has  to  be  a  strategy  for  all  of  this.  But  I  think 
if  we  just  look  at  the  Fund  and  how  to  make  it  credible,  if  we 
would  go  to  the  intrastate  funding  that  I  was  talking  about,  if  we 
would  have  broadband  paying  in,  as  well  as  receiving,  thereby 
greatly  expanding  the  revenue  base  of  the  Fund,  and  given  that 
we’ve  already  tried  to  true-up  wireless  and  VoIP  and  do  the  over-
sight—I think we would have a fairly viable approach to Universal 
Service. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Would  you  change  the  Commission’s  current 
position  that  the  broadband  carrier  would  receive  support  based 
upon the cost of the legacy carrier? 

Mr.  COPPS.  I  think  that’s  something  we  can  look  at.  I  just  want 
to  make  sure  rural  carriers  and  rural  consumers  have  access  to 
what they need. So, can we maybe look at that basis? Yes. But, you 
know,  it  really  concerns  me  to  see  so  many  of  the  large  companies 
selling  off  rural  exchanges.  That  puts  the  burden  on  any  company 
coming  in  and  really  put  broadband  out  to  rural  consumers.  The 
burden falls on these rural carriers. So, yes, I’m alive to having the 
oversight  and  making  sure  that  the  distribution  is  disciplined,  but 
there  has  to  be  that  ability  to  cover  the  legitimate  costs  of  getting 
advanced telecommunications to all consumers in all states. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Mr.  Landis,  thanks  for  your  comment  about 
my Hoosier background, but what do you think about this comment 
about the concept of having the states and the Federal agencies in 
a  partnership,  in  terms  of  bringing  on  this  broadband  conversion? 
Mr.  LANDIS.  Mr.  Vice  Chairman,  I  would  agree  with  my  col-
leagues.  And  I  would  add  that  I  think  there’s  strong  agreement 
among all of us on the Joint Board in that regard. I think in many 
states  the  Governors  are  looking  at  broadband  as  an  economic  de-
velopment tool. So, in addition to just looking at it as a communica-
tions  tool,  it  becomes  an  economic  development  tool.  I  believe  the 
states would readily opt into the opportunity to add to and to grow 
funds  to  develop  those  areas  that  are  underserved  and  most  dif-
ficult  and  most  costly  to  reach.  In  Wyoming,  for  example,  they’ve 
undertaken  a  very  extensive  study  at  a  very  granular  level  to  de-
termine not only the cost of serving all unserved areas in the state, 
but to determine the least-cost mode of doing so for each unserved 
area.  If  you  coupled  that,  for  example,  with  an  auction  which  al-
lows all intermodal competitors to bid, but set a ceiling on the cost, 
which is the lowest cost, then you have a level playing field oppor-
tunity for all intermodal competitors and, at the same time, secure 
build-out  for  the  least  amount  of  funds  expended  to  get  to  those 
highest-cost areas. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Thank  you  very  much.  My  time’s  up.  I  don’t 
know that other areas have the same problem we do. Our tele-med-
icine,  our  tele-education,  out  tele-conferencing  for  disasters  are  all 
tied  to  this  system  that  currently  is  supported  by  Universal  Serv-

ice.  Any  disruption  in  that  would  disrupt  the  healthcare  system, 
the  education  system,  and  the  overall  survival  system,  in  terms  of 
disasters.  So,  we’re  very  worried  about  this  transition  in  our  area, 
to make sure that it doesn’t dislocate the existing service as it tries 
to bring on a new service. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank you, sir. 
Senator Dorgan? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
First  of  all,  thanks  for  your  testimony.  Senator  Stevens  has  in-
troduced  a  broadband  bill.  Senator  Smith  and  I  have  reintroduced 
our broadband bill. Both, I think, are reflective of what might have 
been possible in the last Congress. I, kind of, view both as a start-
ing point. I’m much more interested in what is required than what 
is  possible.  I  think  we  ought  to  stretch  what  is  possible  to  what  is 
required.  And  I  want  to  just  ask  a  couple  of  questions  about  that. 
As  I  understand  it,  the  Commission  defines  broadband  as  200 

kilobits. Is that correct? 

Mr. COPPS. That’s correct. 
Senator DORGAN. That’s almost unbelievable to me, frankly. You 
know, you take a look at a number of foreign countries, they’re get-
ting 20 times our speed for half our cost, because they’ve developed 
much more aggressive public policy, deciding that they wanted the 
buildout of advanced services more universally. 

I was here in 1996, with my colleagues, when we wrote this bill, 
and we talked about, in this legislation, that we wanted to provide 
consumers in rural and high-cost areas with access to telecommuni-
cations and information services that are reasonably comparable to 
those services and rates provided in urban areas. And so, what we 
said was, ‘‘Individuals in rural, insular, and high-cost areas should 
have  access  to  basic  and  advanced  services  at  rates  that  are  rea-
sonably  comparable  to  rates  charged  for  similar  services  in  urban 
areas.’’  I  don’t  understand,  I  would  say  to  the  two  Commissioners, 
why the Commission has described that provision in law as not in-
cluding Universal Service support for broadband. 

Mr. Copps, could you respond to—— 
Mr.  COPPS.  I  agree.  I  think  we  have  the  charge,  under  the  Tele-
communications  Act,  to  be  addressing  that  and  bringing  advanced 
services  to  rural  areas.  As  I  said  in  my  statement,  I  don’t  know 
that we have a consensus on that particular challenge, but I’m cer-
tain  that  we  need  to  meet  it.  This  is  the  infrastructure  of  our  fu-
ture.  I’m  convinced  that  some  of  those  rural  citizens  in  North  Da-
kota are just not going to get high-speed broadband, really competi-
tive  high-speed  broadband,  unless  we  develop  a  national  strategy 
and  use  this  Fund  in  a  more  effective  fashion  to  bring  that  kind 
of advanced telecommunications to all of the citizens of your State, 
and the other states, too. 

Senator DORGAN. Commissioner Tate? 
Ms.  TATE.  You  know,  I  share  your  concerns.  I  think  we  all  do. 
We are very concerned about getting these services out to the rural 
parts of America. I think that, really, Commissioner Landis hit the

40 

nail on the head, in that this is really about economic development 
for  our  whole  country.  So,  we  look  forward  to  working  with  you  as 
we move forward. 

Senator  DORGAN.  But  my  question  wasn’t  about  my  concern.  I 
think  all  of  us  have  the  concern.  My  question  was  about  the  way 
we  wrote  the  law.  We  specifically  included,  in  the  law,  advanced 
services.  We  weren’t  sure  what  those  advanced  services  were,  but 
we  understood  what  we  wanted  Universal  Service  to  mean;  and 
that is, people in rural areas would be able to get reasonably com-
parable  services  at  affordable  prices.  And  so,  I  think  the  way  this 
is worded—you know, I went to a high school where I had a senior 
class  of  nine  students.  We  didn’t  have  a  foreign  language.  So,  I 
couldn’t read it if it were a foreign language. But this is not a for-
eign  language.  As  I  read  this,  it  says  advanced  telecommunication 
and  information  services  shall  be  accessible,  ‘‘in  all  regions  of  the 
Nation,’’  and  then  we  talk  about  access  to  advanced  services  at 
rates reasonably comparable. I don’t understand how that can have 
been misread for so long by so many, Mr.—— 

Mr. GREGG. Senator Dorgan, 254(c) of the Telecom Act sets forth 
how  Universal  Service,  or  those  services  that  will  be  supported  by 
the Universal Service Fund, are to be determined. ‘‘Universal Serv-
ice’’  is  defined  as  an  evolving  level  of  telecommunications  services. 
And there are set forth a number of criteria which the Joint Board 
has  to  evaluate  in  determining  whether  to  add  services  to  the  list 
of  supported  services.  Currently,  there  are,  I  believe,  13  separate 
services, which basically make up plain old telephone services, that 
are supported. One of the criteria that we have to look at in decid-
ing whether to add broadband is whether it is subscribed to by ac-
tion  of  market  forces  by  a  substantial  majority  of  residential  cus-
tomers.  The  last  time  we  examined  this,  in  2002,  only  12  percent 
of residential customers actually subscribed to broadband. The ver-
dict  of  the  Joint  Board  then  was,  ‘‘It’s  coming,  but  it’s  not  yet 
there.’’  Right  now,  we  are  almost  at  50  percent.  The  time  to  move 
is now, under the existing law. 

Senator  DORGAN.  You  know,  the  Joint  Board,  that’s  a  different 
subject,  perhaps  for  another  day.  I  know  it  relates  to  this,  but  the 
Joint  Board’s  been  talking  about  primary  line  restriction  for  rural 
areas,  and  so  on.  What  that  is,  is  a  carve-out  for  a  disadvantage 
for rural areas. So, I have minimum high regard for some of those 
recommendations, I might say. 

Let  me  ask,  my  understanding  is,  the  FCC  currently  says  that 
broadband  is  ‘‘deployed,’’  in  an  area  if  one  customer  in  a  Zip  Code 
is served. Is that correct, Commissioner Copps? 

Mr.  COPPS.  That  is  correct.  It’s  almost  like  saying  if  one  person 
in your town drives a Mercedes-Benz, everybody must drive a Mer-
cedes-Benz.  But  that’s  the  methodology  we’ve  used.  I  think  the 
Commission is on the verge of trying to tee up a little more sophis-
ticated  approach  to  this,  but  that  involves  notice  and  comment  on 
a proceeding, and we’re about 15 years too late to be heading down 
that road. 

In answer to the previous question, though, a further factor that 
you  need  to  take  care  of  is,  we’ve  been  doing  our  dead-level  best— 
not  me,  but  the  Commission,  generally—to  exclude  some  of  these 
systems,  some  of  these  technologies,  from  Universal  Service  by  re-

classifying them as information service. So, the plain old telephone 
service  of  the  last  century,  yes,  we’re  supporting  that,  the  POTS. 
But we don’t support the PANS, which is the Pretty Awesome New 
Stuff.  And  I  think  America  needs  the  POTS  and  the  PANS  in  the 
21st century. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Well,  first  of  all,  this  is  horribly  complicated; 
I  understand  that.  I  mean,  just  trying  to  think  through  all  of  this, 
and  understand  it—it’s  horribly  complicated.  But,  I’ve  got  to  tell 
you,  I  think  we’re  really  tiptoeing,  and  have  been  tiptoeing  for  a 
long  while;  and,  in  some  cases,  been  tiptoeing  on  not  very  solid 
ground.  I  think  some  serious  mistakes  have  been  made  in  imple-
mentation  of  the  law.  No  question,  we  have  to  broaden  the  base. 
All  of  us  understand  that.  And  there  have  been  previous  decisions 
that  should  have  broadened  the  base,  that  did  not.  We  have  to  do 
that. 

But, more than that, I think both the Congress and the Commis-
sion  have  to  decide  on  how  broad  these  goals  are  going  to  be,  and 
how  aggressive  we’re  going  to  be  in  meeting  them.  And  I  sense  a 
reluctance here in the panel and also with respect to the witnesses, 
a  reluctance  to  really  describe  what  is  required.  Because  I  come 
from  a  town  of  300  people.  I’m  just  telling  you,  lots  of  places  are 
getting left behind and are going to be permanently left behind. 

Mr.  Landis,  you  talked  about  this  being  economic  development. 
Well, I’ll tell you where economic development is not going to hap-
pen,  certainly  if  the  Joint  Board  would  have  had  something  to  say 
about  primary  line.  I  mean,  you  will  not  have  any  crack  at  eco-
nomic  development  in  areas  where  you  live  on  the  wrong  side  of 
the digital divide. 

So,  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing.  I  think 
this  is  a  starting  point,  and  I’m  much  more  interested  in  what  is 
required—— 

Senator STEVENS. Would you yield for just one—— 
Senator DORGAN. I certainly would. 
Senator STEVENS. Senator, if you pick up the phone and want to 
make a reservation in one our major hotels, you’re talking to some-
one  in  India.  That  system  could  be  in  North  Dakota  or  in  Alaska, 
in  many  parts  of  rural  America,  but  for  the  absence  of  this  kind 
of  service.  I  really  think  it  is  economic  development,  and  bringing 
home some of the stuff that’s gone overseas, because of the lack of 
the communication network we needed to keep up. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Well,  I  agree  with  that.  All  I’m  saying  is,  I 
don’t  think  any  of  us—the  Congress,  the  Commission—none  of  us 
can afford to be timid. I mean, we’ve got to move. It’s been 11 years 
now since we passed this bill. 

The CHAIRMAN. Yes. 
Senator  DORGAN.  And,  as  I  said,  I  read  it,  and  it’s  in  English, 
and  I  understand  what  is  possible.  I  want  the  FCC  to  broaden  its 
capability  to  read  this  in  a  way  that  does  what  is  possible  to  give 
all Americans the same opportunities. 

Mr. COPPS. Can I make just one comment? Because I don’t want 
anybody  ever  to  think  that  I’m  the  least  bit  reluctant  about  this. 
I  believe  that  this  is  absolutely  integral  to  the  future  of  our  coun-
try.  I  believe  this  is  the  central  infrastructure  challenge  that  the 
United  States  of  America  has.  As  you  look  throughout  our  history,

we’ve  had  infrastructure  challenges.  When  we  first  started  this 
country,  settled  the  new  lands,  the  question  was,  how  do  you  get 
products  to  markets?  So,  we  decided,  as  a  country,  to  build  roads 
and turnpikes and river improvements and canals and all the rest. 
Then we built regional railroads. After the Civil War, we’re a conti-
nental power, how do we bring the country together? We committed 
to  the  infrastructure,  we  built  the  transcontinental  railroad.  Even 
in  the  Eisenhower  years,  we  built  the  interstate  highway  system. 
This  generation’s  rendezvous  with  destiny  is  to  get  these  modern 
telecommunication  systems  out  to  all  of  our  citizens.  It’s  economic 
development,  it’s  individual  opportunity,  it’s  individual  fulfillment. 
And I think it’s the future of the country. 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, my time is up, but I—the inter-
state  highway  issue  is  exactly  the  point.  They  probably  wouldn’t 
justify building an interstate highway through North Dakota, East 
to  West,  except  as  it  connects  our  Nation  and  as  a  bridge.  The 
same is true with respect to the digital interstate highway that we 
have to build everywhere in this country. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Pryor? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Interesting discussion today. I want to thank the panel for being 
here.  When  you  look  at  the  future  of  telecommunications,  to  me  it 
seems  like  it’s  wireless  and  broadband.  I  don’t  think  there’s  any 
doubt  about  that.  I  mean,  that’s  the  way  everything  seems  to  be 
going.  And  I’m  glad  we’re  having  a  broadband  discussion  here 
today,  because  it’s  essential.  It’s  like  what  everybody  has  said  in 
the room. There are some challenges in figuring it out, but we have 
to do it the right way to make sure that all Americans—within rea-
son, but all Americans have access to broadband. 

Let  me  switch  gears  just  for  a  moment,  about  wireless,  because 
I  do  feel  like  America  is  going  wireless.  Clearly,  that’s  just  the 
trend that things are going, the direction things are going. For ex-
ample,  in  Arkansas,  we  have  47,000  farms.  Those  farms  support 
about 287,000 jobs in the ag sector. Farmers need wireless commu-
nications.  Someone  told  me,  yesterday,  they’d  rather  sit  on  their 
tractor and transact business—it’s not easy for them to get off and 
go  in  the  farmhouse  and  do  all  that—and  do  that.  And  that’s  the 
way  it  is  everywhere.  And  everybody  ought  to  have  access  to  that. 
And—for  example,  a  farmer—broadband  is  important  to  them; 
wireless  broadband.  They  can  check  commodity  prices.  They  can 
transact  their  business  when  they’re  out  there  in  the  fields  and 
taking  care  of  other  business.  And  they  ought  to  have  that  same 
access that other people have, as well. 

So,  Ms.  Tate,  let  me  start  with  you,  if  I  can,  and  really  ask  the 
whole  panel  about  the  new  rules  for  high-cost  support  that  will 
continue  to  support  wireless.  Is  that  what  we’re  committed  to 
doing, is to make sure the future is wireless and broadband? 

Ms.  TATE.  Well,  I  think  that  you’re  right,  that  there  are  short- 
term  issues  and  solutions  that  we’ve  tried  to  lay  out  here  today. 
And  then,  there  are  also  longer-term  solutions.  And,  as  Senator

Stevens  says,  we’ve  got  to  think  about  the  transition  in  between, 
so  that  companies  who  have  been  reliant  on  some  of  these  funds 
have  the  opportunity  to,  as  they  are  learning  new  business  plans 
and  reengineering  their  business  plans  for  all  the  new  technology, 
also have to realize whatever is going to happen with the Fund. So, 
I certainly recognize the need, and we want to be supportive of all 
the  new  innovative  technological  changes,  and  I  appreciate  exactly 
what you’re saying. 

Senator  PRYOR.  You  know,  one  of  the  challenges,  being  from  a 
rural  State—and  pretty  much  all  of  us  are  from  rural  states  here 
today,  or  states  that  have  a  large  percentage  of  rural  population— 
one  of  the  challenges  in  the  traditional  wireline—by  the  way,  I 
think  there’s  always  going  to  be  a  market  for  wireline,  the  tradi-
tional telephone. I don’t see that going away. I don’t think we’ll go 
100  percent  wireless.  But  one  of  the  challenges  has  always  been, 
in rural America, to string that copper wire out the miles and miles 
and  miles  you  have  to,  to  get  to  a  few  customers;  whereas,  you 
have  a  densely  populated  area,  where  you  have  to  string  it  maybe 
a  block,  and  you  get  ten  times  the  customers  that  you  would  get 
with several miles out in the country. But I would like to hear from 
the  rest  of  the  panel  about  your  commitment  to  making  sure  that 
wireless is a real option for rural America. 

Mr. Copps? 
Mr. COPPS. Well, I agree with that, too. I think what wireless has 
already  done  is  fantastic,  and  the  future  is  boundless.  That  being 
said,  I  think  we  are  under  a  charge  to  observe  some  semblance  of 
technology  neutrality  at  the  Commission.  The  reality  of  the  situa-
tion  right  now  is  that  98  percent  of  the  people  who  are  getting 
broadband today, are getting it through DSL and cable modem. So, 
our  hope  for  the  future  is  that  wireless  will  play  its  rightful  role. 
I  think  we  will  see  a  lot  of  innovations.  We  already  are.  And  I 
think the one obligation of the Commission is to encourage that, to 
provide  the  right  kind  of  incentives  that  don’t  disadvantage  an-
other  technology  in  the  process,  but  that  really  open  the  frontiers 
for these industries to develop. 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Commissioner Landis? 
Mr. LANDIS. I would agree with my Federal colleagues that wire-
less  has  to  play  an  important  role  in  the  process.  The  challenge  is 
to  address  it  in  such  a  way  that  we  don’t  inadvertently  make  the 
wrong decisions. In—— 

Senator PRYOR. Tell us what—— 
Mr. LANDIS.—many cases—— 
Senator PRYOR.—tell us what you mean by that. 
Mr. LANDIS. In many cases, in hundreds of areas across the coun-
try there are already multiple wireless companies present. In many 
of those cases, those entries occurred based on a competitive model; 
that is, they entered the market to serve a customer base that they 
saw  that  they  could  do  without  support.  In  other  cases,  companies 
have  built  their  entry  premised  on  Universal  Service  support.  And 
whatever  we  do,  in  terms  of  the  solutions  that  are  developed,  we 
want  to  make  certain  that  we  don’t  inadvertently  advantage  one 
company in an environment which may be largely competitive. The 
challenge, of course, is in separating those two out and determining 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

44 

where  a  truly  competitive  situation  has  been  the  motivating  factor 
behind entry, and those areas where entry really does require sup-
port. 

Senator PRYOR. Actually, just a comment on that. I love competi-
tion.  I  think  that’s  healthy.  But  we’ve  all  heard  the  terms  like 
‘‘cream-skimming’’ or ‘‘cherry-picking.’’ We’ve all heard those terms. 
But,  you  know,  we  all  know  that  the  investment,  by  and  large,  is 
going  to  follow  the  population.  I  mean,  that’s  just  the  way  it  is.  I 
mean, because that’s where the money is, that’s where the prelimi-
nary investment is. So, I just think we need to make sure that the 
proper amount of investment is going out to rural America to serve 
those needs, as well. 

Did you have a comment? 
Mr.  BURKE.  Senator,  I  come  from  a  State,  too,  where  the  ‘‘C’’  I 
worry about a lot isn’t necessarily competition, but, instead, is cov-
erage. And—— 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr. BURKE.—I understand—— 
Senator PRYOR. We have some that—— 
Mr. BURKE.—your concern. 
Senator PRYOR.—yes. 
Mr.  BURKE.  The  only  thing  I  will  say,  though,  is  that  I  believe 
that  the  Universal  Service  Fund  should  have  some  limit  as  to 
where  the  line  would  be  drawn  between  subsidizing  competition 
and  making  sure  that  rural  America  has  a  reasonably  comparable 
service.  That’s  a  challenge.  I’ll  freely  admit  that.  Because  both 
sides  of  that  coin  can  readily  be  seen.  I  think  that  maybe  that’s 
what  we  have  to  focus  on.  Maybe  the  focus  ought  to  be,  where  do 
we draw that line? And I think that that’s a challenge. 

Today,  my  son  has  no  idea  what  a  wireline  is.  He  thinks  just 

electric service runs through those wires and poles—— 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr. BURKE.—outside his door. 
Senator PRYOR. Right. 
And, Mr. Gregg? Thank you. 
Mr. GREGG. Senator, your question about wireless raises some of 
the  issues  with  the  problems  of  the  high-cost  fund  today.  We  have 
created  a  de  facto  $1  billion  wireless  infrastructure  fund  through 
the  operation  of  current  high-cost  fund  rules.  Nobody  planned  it 
that  way,  nobody  intended  it,  nobody  is  looking  at  it  that  way 
today. But that is, in fact, what it is. The problem is, it is not dis-
tributed  evenly.  The  wireless  carriers  are  flocking,  obviously,  to 
where  the  money  is,  like  Willy  Loman,  in  talking  about  robbing 
banks.  They’re  doing  what  is  economically  rational  under  the  cur-
rent rules. 

If  we  want  to  support  wireless  buildout  in  rural  areas,  if  this 
Congress  wants  to  support  wireless  buildout  in  rural  areas,  they 
should  say  so.  Like  the  broadband  fund  in  S.  101,  there  probably 
should  be  set  up  a  wireless  broadband  fund,  as  well,  with  some 
principles  to  guide  distribution.  Otherwise,  we’re  going  to  continue 
to  have  it  pocketed  away  in  certain  discrete  areas  instead  of  equi-
tably distributed throughout the United States. 

Senator PRYOR. Mr. Chairman, thank you.

Senator Smith? 

STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Senator  SMITH.  Back  to  the  same  bill.  I’m  proud  to  be  with  my 
colleagues  on  this  bill.  Enough  may  have  already  been  said  about 
it,  but  it  does  create  a  $500  million  account  within  the  Fund,  and 
it specifically targets broadband deployment. 

I think you’ve all answered this generally in agreement that the 
Universal  Fund  should  be  used  to  promote  broadband  deployment. 
But  I’m  wondering,  are  there  other  ways  we  can  encourage 
broadband  deployment  to  rural  Americans?  And  I’m  really  think-
ing,  should  the  Universal  Service  Fund  be  tied  to  minimum 
broadband  speeds?  Does  anybody  have  a  thought  on  that?  Should 
that be a standard? 

Mr.  COPPS.  Well,  I  know  it  shouldn’t  be  tied  to  200  kilobits  up 
and  down,  as  we  currently  define  broadband.  You’ve  got  to  find  a 
way  to  incentivize  it.  And  you’ll  hear  a  lot  of  talk  today  about  the 
wonderful job we’re doing with broadband deployment and penetra-
tion.  But  so  much  of  it  is  at  speeds  that  are  not  going  to  make  us 
competitive in the world, are not going to make rural America com-
petitive  with  urban  America.  So,  having  some  benchmarks  like 
that, I think, is an important part of an incentivizing system that’s 
really going to get this stuff out. 

Senator SMITH. Well, you know, to Senator—— 
Mr. COPPS. I mean, the devil’s in the details, but I think the con-

cept is certainly worth looking at. 

Senator SMITH.—to Senator Stevens’ point, if we’re going to bring 
the  jobs  back  from  India  to  Alaska  and  North  Dakota—I’d  throw 
in Oregon, too, and Arkansas—it’s got to be comparable, doesn’t it? 
Yes. 

Certainly,  one  of  the  goals  of  the  Fund  is  to  reform  the  control 
and growth of that fund. And, you know, Senator Stevens has men-
tioned  that  the  reverse  auctions  may  or  may  not  be  a  good  idea. 
I  don’t  know.  I  think  he’s  opposed  to  that.  I  have  no  firm  position 
on  that,  especially.  But  I’m  wondering,  are  there  other  ways  we 
might control the growth of the Fund, short of capping it or reverse 
auctions? 

Mr.  GREGG.  There  are  any  number  of  ways  you  can  limit  the 
Fund.  The  Fund  has  a  number  of  discrete  inputs  that  result  in 
what finally comes out of the Fund. Decisions that were made early 
on, as I said in my opening statement, have resulted in the system 
we  have  now.  We  could  have  gone  to  a  system  similar  to  that  de-

scribed by Commissioner Burke for the whole high-cost fund, where 
we simply allocated a certain amount of money to each State, said, 
‘‘If you match this, you get the Federal share. You then decide how 
to  allocate  it.  Your  states  are  closer  to  it.  You  know  where  the 
money  needs  to  go.  You  know  where  the  high-cost  areas  are.  You 
know where the unserved and underserved areas are. Go to it, sub-
ject  to  audit  after  the  fact.’’  You  could  have,  even  within  the  con-
text  of  the  current  Universal  Service  Fund,  limited  receipt  of  Uni-
versal  Service  subsidies  to  only  one  facilities-based  provider  for 
each study area in the United States. All of those would have con-
strained  the  size  of  the  Fund,  but  yet  provided  adequate  support 
to do everything we want to do. 

Senator  SMITH.  Is  there  a  consensus  that  the  best  way  to  direct 

is through the states, as opposed to a certain provider? 

Mr.  GREGG.  I  think  the  states  have  an  obvious  role.  In  fact,  the 
Tenth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals,  in  the  Quest  I  decision,  said  that 
section  254  describes  a  cooperative  State-Federal  effort  to  promote 
and  advance  Universal  Service.  So,  states  will  always  be  involved. 

Senator SMITH. Any other thoughts on that? 
Mr. COPPS. Well, I would hope we would always have a construc-
tive  Federal-State  relationship.  I  think  we’ve  kind  of  gotten  away 
from  it  in  some  of  the  FCC  preemptive  activities  that  have  taken 
place over the last few years. The genius of America is having that 
balanced partnership. 

You asked about specific steps to control the growth of that fund. 
You  know,  one  that  several  observers  have  talked  about,  and  I 
think  I  mentioned,  is  doing  something  about  the  identical  support 
system. Yes, we want to encourage all of these multiplicity of tech-
nologies,  but  we  want  to  do  it  in  a  realistic  fashion  and  allow  for 
the  recovery  of  legitimate  costs.  But  this  fund  is  under  too  much 
pressure to go beyond that and to be adding any monies that don’t 
need to be in it. So, that’s one way that we could do it. 

Senator SMITH. Thank you. 
Mr.  BURKE.  Senator,  I  would  only  mention,  and  only  add,  that 
I  think  that  there  are  other  ways  besides  just  an  auction  that  can 
be  viewed.  In  fact,  we’ve  heard,  from  several  presenters,  issues  on 
disaggregation  and  better  targeting  the  areas  that  need  help. 
There’s no particular answer that seems to be an absolute given at 
this point in time. And one of the reasons for the caps—I just want 
to make sure you don’t think that the idea of a cap was an ultimate 
solution—as a matter of fact, it clearly is a Band-Aid, trying to give 
us  the  ability  to  work  toward  that  point  where  we  can  come  up 
with a more permanent answer. 

Senator SMITH. Thank you very much. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Rockefeller? 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I just want to make a point, since I came in late, and then I have 

two questions within 7 minutes. 

The  just-departed  Senator,  Olympia  Snowe,  and  I  had  an  event 
the  other  night,  which  many  people  should  have  been  at,  which 
was  about  the  E-Rate.  And  you  can’t  possibly  expect  me  to  be  in 
the Commerce Committee on this subject without talking about the 
E-Rate. I think it’s probably received more oversight than any gov-
ernment program ever conceived. And that’s been a good thing. We

have  not  paid  the  same  level  of  attention  to  the  high-cost  fund. 
We’re facing serious challenges in trying to adapt Universal Service 
to,  as  Commissioner  Copps  has  said,  an  entirely  different  tele-
communications environment. 

I  share  Billy  Jack  Gregg’s  concern  that  the  growth  of  the  Fund 
is  becoming  increasingly  financially  burdensome  to  the  consumers. 
If  we  do  not  adopt  policies  that  limit  the  growth  of  the  Fund,  we 
will  know  that,  as  the  Honorable  Mr.  Burke  has  indicated,  that  a 
cap will be inevitable, but not at this point. 

I  would  prefer  that  the  FCC  adopt  policies  that  would  limit  the 
growth—and  this  will  lead  to  a  question  to  the  two  Commis-
sioners—to limit the Fund of the growth so that the cap is not nec-
essary.  But  I  know—that  was  a  very  thoughtful  statement  by  Mr. 
Gregg—supporting  the  cap,  at  least  in  the  short  term,  because  of 
Congress’s and the FCC’s inability to make hard decisions, what it 
amounts to. Senator Dorgan was talking about that. I think it’s un-
fortunate it got to this point. 

The  FCC  and  the  Joint  Board  are  facing  short-term  tough  deci-
sions  to  limit  the  growth  of  the  Fund.  We  all  must  begin  the  long 
process.  I  believe  there  are  three  main  points.  I  believe  that 
broadband  providers  must  begin  to  pay  into  the  Universal  Service 
system if we’re going to have a long-term sustainable base of reve-
nues, called a ‘‘pyramid base.’’ Two, we should demand that recipi-
ents  of  Universal  Service  Fund  resources  that  get  those  things, 
that  they  be  required  to  transition  their  networks  into  the  next- 
generation  broadband  network.  That  has  not  been  necessarily  ad-
vanced  toward  them,  but  I  think  it’s  critical.  It  does  not  make 
sense  to  continue  subsidizing  the  deployment  of  networks  that  are 
becoming  obsolete.  We  have  been  told,  third,  for  2  years,  that 
broadband  is  the  future  of  all  communications.  I  agree  with  Sen-
ator  Dorgan  again.  We  talk,  we  talk,  we  talk,  we  talk.  I  think  I’ve 
been  on  12  bills  in  the  Finance  Committee  to  do  with  broadband, 
none  of  which  get  it.  They  all  get  75  cosponsors,  and  nothing  ever 
happens.  So,  we’ve  been  told  for  2  years  that  broadband  is  the  fu-
ture  of  all  communications.  We’ve  got  to  make  sure  that  rural 
Americans fully participate in this future. 

Now, my questions, to all panelists; in a previous hearing, Chair-
man  Martin  said  that  the  FCC  has  the  authority  to  broaden  the 
Universal  Service  program  to  include  broadband,  but,  he  said,  it 
didn’t  have  the  money.  In  Mr.  Burke’s  statement,  he  states  that 
current  law  may  not  allow  the  FCC  to  include  broadband  in  the 
program.  I  would  like  to  ask  each  of  the  other  panelists,  or  all  of 
the  panelists,  starting  with  Commissioners  Tate  and  Copps,  their 
thoughts on whether they believe the FCC has the authority to add 
broadband to the list of supported services to the Universal Service 
Fund. 

Ms.  TATE.  Well,  Senator,  I  think  that  whether  we  have  the  au-
thority or not also has to be balanced with whether or not you uti-
lize  that  authority  or  not,  and  the  continued  pressure  that  that 
would put on the Fund. So—— 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. You know, I’m already off track with you. 
The  answer  is  not,  Can  you  afford  it?  Do  you  have  the  authority? 
That’s all I’m asking. 

Ms. TATE. Yes, sir, I think that we do——

Senator ROCKEFELLER. OK. 
Ms. TATE.—have the authority. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Commissioner Copps? 
Mr.  COPPS.  I  think  we  have  the  authority.  I  think  the  1996  Act 
makes  plain  that  we  are  supposed  to  consider  evolving  advanced 
technologies.  I  think  that  translates  into  broadband,  and  can  only 
translate into broadband. So, yes, I think the Commission has that 
authority. 

Mr. BURKE. Senator, I think that the concern that I had was sim-
ply,  as  you  read  the  Act—and  as  the  newest  member  of  the  Joint 
Board,  you  tend  to  just  go  back  and  read  the  Act  itself  before  you 
go  anywhere  else—and  the  concern  that  I  had  was  that,  in  fact, 
there  is,  implicit  in  the  subsequent  section  to  the  (b)  section,  that 
there be a take rate of a majority of the residential households. I’d 
like to think that actually, however, that’s almost a nonquestion for 
us  now,  based  on  the  definition  we  have  of  ‘‘broadband  services.’’ 
Even  if  you  do  look  at  that,  and  the  take  rate  does  have  to  be  50 
percent  to  sustain  a  challenge,  we’re  there,  or  will  be  there  so 
quickly  that,  by  the  time  we’re  able  to  do  anything  with  regard  to 
supported services, even if we were able to do it in a matter of just 
a  few  months,  we’re  already  going  to  have  a  50  percent  take.  So, 
hopefully that’s a question we don’t have to answer, anyway. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you. 
Mr. GREGG. The answer to your question is yes, even though the 
FCC  has  defined  many  of  the  broadband  services  as,  quote,  ‘‘infor-
mation  services,’’  they  have  also  said  that  each  of  those  services— 
cable  modem,  DSL—have  a  telecommunications  component.  As  a 
result,  254(c)  would  apply  in  determining  whether  they  should  be 
added  to  the  list  of  supported  services.  As  I  indicated  in  response 
to Senator Dorgan a while ago, the problem with adding broadband 
to the list of supported services and bringing it under the umbrella 
of the Universal Service Fund is a problem with the wording of the 
Act. We are going to start moving on adding broadband, but it will 
take 2 years to get it finished. If you want it done faster, Congress 
needs to change the wording of the Act. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Is that on the record? 
[Laughter.] 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you. 
Mr. Landis? 
Mr. LANDIS. Yes, Senator. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. The answer is yes? 
Mr. LANDIS. Yes. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. OK. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  I  thought  you  were  just  recognizing  that 

I was sitting here. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. I wasn’t sure. 
Mr. LANDIS. Both. 
Senator  STEVENS.  Ask  Mr.  Gregg  for  a  draft  of  the  amendment 

he would like to—— 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Yes, that’s a very good idea. 
You got an amendment?

Mr.  GREGG.  You  could  just  change  254(c)  to  say  it  does  include 

broadband, as defined by the FCC. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. The Clerk has recorded that. 
Mr. BURKE. Or with faster speeds than the FCC. 
Mr.  GREGG.  I’m  assuming  that  the  FCC  is  going  to  evolve  that 
definition.  200K  may  have  made  sense  back  in  1998,  when  they 
first  started  recording  the  advance  of  broadband.  It  now  probably 
is something closer to 768K or 1 meg. In a few years, it’ll probably 
be closer to 10 to 100 megs. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. I’ve got to do my final question. 
Commissioner  Tate,  last  year  the  FCC  relieved  DSL  providers 
from  paying  into  broadband.  At  the  same  time,  the  FCC  required 
VoIP  companies  to  contribute  to  the  Universal  Service  Fund.  This 
mandate is currently being challenged in court, where it could lose. 
Again, last year the FCC increased the percentage of wireless con-
sumer  bills  subject  to  USF  assessment.  Now,  how  have  these  deci-
sions  impacted  the  flow  of  revenues  into  the  Universal  Service 
Fund? Is the FCC collecting more, or are they collecting less, reve-
nues  because  of  some  of  these  decisions  that  they  have  made?  It’s 
my understanding that wireless carriers are paying less in USF ob-
ligations than the industry did before you increased their safe har-
bor.  What  will  the  FCC  do  if  the  courts  strike  down  the  require-
ment relating to VoIP, as set forth by the FCC? 

Ms.  TATE.  Well,  Senator,  I  don’t  think  that  I  have  the  numbers 
with me today to absolutely answer exactly what you’re asking and 
what the exact figures are. I think that we tried to make those de-
cisions, because they were the right decisions. I—the DSL decision 
was made before I got—— 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. OK. 
Commissioner Copps? 
Mr.  COPPS.  I  think  the  practical  effect  of  the  mistaken  decision 
that the Commission made to exclude broadband was really to cre-
ate  a  shortfall  which  is  probably  somewhere  in  the  area  of  $350 
million  to  $500  million.  Now,  that  doesn’t  mean  the  Fund  is  sud-
denly  deficient,  because  it’s  USAC  that  sets  the  size  of  the  Fund. 
It  means  it  skews  everything.  It  means  you  have  to  go  out  and 
raise  the  monies  from  somewhere  else.  Different  businesses,  dif-
ferent  consumers  feel  the  impact.  But  there’s  no  question  in  my 
mind  that  it  had  an  unhealthy  effect.  And  if  we’re  really  going  to 
go down this road of broadband that everybody’s talking about, cer-
tainly  we  have  to  reverse  course  and  make  sure  that  it’s  going  to 
be contributing. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  With  the  Chairman’s  permission,  I  think 

that—Senator Dorgan, did you have a comment? 

Senator DORGAN. No, I’ll defer. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. OK. 
Senator DORGAN. Thanks. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you.

I want to welcome all of you here today. And obviously these are, 
you  know,  complex  issues,  and  some  are  more  timely  than  others. 
And I just want to be clear on the question that was posed by Sen-
ator  Rockefeller,  on  the  question  of  changes  in  the  existing  tele-
communications  law  with  respect  to  broadband.  So,  which  would 
come first? Would you be proceeding with any action in broadband 
under  the  Universal  Service  Fund?  Would  you  be  pending  any  ac-
tion by Congress? Or would you be taking your own action eventu-
ally on this question? I’m not clear on that. 

Mr. COPPS. I would be in favor of going ahead and taking actions 
under  authority  that  I  think  we  have.  Whether  I  can  get  three 
votes to do that—— 

Senator SNOWE. Right. 
Mr. COPPS.—at the Federal Communications Commission, I don’t 
know. But I think that’s the road that I would like to go down, that 
kind of initiative. 

Senator SNOWE. Commissioner Tate? 
Ms.  TATE.  Yes,  I’m  trying  to  say  this  in  a  very  thoughtful  way, 
but I think that, at the same time that we think that we have the 
authority,  and  that  we  do  believe  that  this  is  the  direction  the 
country  needs  to  move  ahead,  we  have  some  pretty  stark  and  dra-
matic  rises  in  this  Fund  that  we  have  to  weigh  in  what  we  have 
to  do  first.  I  think  the  growth  of  the  Fund  has  got  to  be  stemmed. 
But,  yes,  I  think  that  we  should  look  at  broadening  the  definition 
to broadband. 

Senator SNOWE. So, would that be contingent on action taken by 
Congress,  on  that  question?  I  mean,  I  think  that  that’s  obviously 
an  important  issue,  in  terms  of  time  frame  here,  as  well,  because 
I agree with you, Commissioner Copps—and I think all of you prob-
ably  share  the  same  thought—I  mean,  there  is  a  timeliness  ques-
tion and an urgency when it comes to broadband deployment, ulti-
mately.  I  mean,  because  we  can’t  afford  to  wait,  given,  you  know, 
our standing in the world, for example. I mean, you know, we rank 
19th or 20th in the world in terms of broadband deployment. In my 
home state of Maine, 73 percent of households don’t have access to 
it. So, I think that’s a major issue, in terms of time frame and what 
the schedule is going to be, in the final analysis. And so, would you 
be  taking  a  vote  anytime  soon  on  this  question?  I  mean,  exactly 
what—— 

Ms. TATE. I think we—— 
Senator SNOWE.—what’s the plan? 
Ms. TATE.—encourage the Chairman to put that before us. 
Senator SNOWE. OK. 
Mr. GREGG. Senator Snowe, as—— 
Senator SNOWE. Yes? 
Mr.  GREGG.—as  I  said  earlier,  it  all  depends  on  the  FCC  taking 
action  under  current  law.  They  have  to  act  first,  refer  it  to  the 
Joint  Board.  But  that’s  a  2-year  process.  If  you  want  it  to  move 
faster—— 

Senator SNOWE. And that’s what you were—— 
Mr. GREGG.—it’s going to—— 
Senator SNOWE.—saying. 
Mr. GREGG.—be up to Congress.

Senator  SNOWE.  I  see.  So,  if  you  want  to  do  it  sooner,  then  we 
have to take Congressional action. I see. Because it’s the FCC first. 
In terms of broadband deployment overall, Senator Stevens obvi-
ously  has,  in  the  telecommunications  rewrite,  a  $500  million  Fund 
for  unserved  areas.  What  are  your  thoughts  on  that  question?  In 
terms  of  trying  to,  you  know,  target  and  limit,  you  know,  the  de-
ployment,  because  we  want  to  contain  the  costs,  is  that  a  way  to 
go  about  it?  If  we  use  specific  geographical  information,  as  some 
have recommended, as a way of trying to contain the growth—if we 
were to include broadband deployment? 

Ms.  TATE.  I  think  you’re  probably  going  to  hear  from  some  pre-
senters  later,  in  the  next  panel,  that  are  going  to  talk  more  about 
targeted  approaches,  and  I  think  that’s  something  that  we  heard 
at the en banc. We haven’t even had a chance to talk about the en 
banc  held  last  week,  and  we  are  still  discussing  that.  We  haven’t 
discussed  them  as  FCC  Commissioners  yet.  But  I  think  those  are 
interesting  proposals.  I  do  think  it’s  important  to  recognize  there 
are a lot of states that have incredible initiatives going on that are 
using their own State tax incentives, for instance, and other incen-
tives,  to  try  to  encourage  broadband  in  their  states.  Kentucky  is 
one.  Tennessee  has  a  task  force.  So,  I  think  that  the  states  are 
doing a lot. 

Senator SNOWE. Commissioner Copps? 
Mr.  COPPS.  I  think  a  targeted  approach  is  fine  in  the  world  in 
which  we  live,  but  I  think,  in  the  final  analysis,  it  comes  down  to, 
how  ambitious  do  we  want  to  be  in  having  a  national  broadband 
strategy? And in terms of Universal Service, does that really mean 
everybody?  It  seems  to  me  it  does.  Does  it  mean  reasonably  com-
parable  service  at  reasonably  comparable  prices?  I  think,  yes.  So, 
I  think  the  ultimate  goal  has  to  be  every  citizen  of  this  country 
having access to this kind of technology and service. 

Senator SNOWE. Thank you. 
Yes? 
Mr.  LANDIS.  Senator,  I  think  one  of  the  things,  which  we’ve  al-
ready addressed, and which you’ll also hear from the second panel, 
is  the  need  for  more  precise  information  with  regard  to  the  cost  of 
doing  so.  In  reality,  there  are  multiple  ways  in  which  we  can  en-
courage  it.  If  the  cost  of  buildout  to  unserved  areas  is  not  too 
great—and don’t ask me to put an exact number on it—it may well 
be  that  tax  incentives  at  the  State  level  would  prove  sufficient  to 
promote  broadband  buildout.  If  you  look  at  the  Wyoming  experi-
ence,  for  example,  where  they  have  projected  costs  based  on  a 
model for those areas that are currently unserved, the tenth docile 
costs  over  $10,000  per  household  for  buildout.  And  so,  tax  incen-
tives  are  not  going  to  prove  sufficient  in  that  situation.  Clearly, 
there  needs  to  be  a  subsidy  if  we  are  going  to  move  forward,  and 
if we have the will to actually make that a reality. 

Senator SNOWE. I see. 
Mr.  LANDIS.  But  the  first  step,  it  seems  to  me,  is  getting  a  han-
dle on the actual costs of doing so, at a much more granular level. 

Senator SNOWE. I see. 
Mr. BURKE. Senator, I think that states are really aware of their 
shortcomings  with  regard  to  broadband  and  advanced  services.  I 
think  you’re  aware  that  Governor  Douglas,  in  Vermont,  has  indi-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

52 

cated his plan to make Vermont an E-State in its entirety by 2010. 
Obviously,  incentives  are  on  the  minds  of  states.  And  that’s  one  of 
the  reasons  why,  it  seemed  to  me,  that  to  help  both  the  Congress 
and  states  target  the  matching-funds  type  of  grants  might  make 
sense.  I  think  that  it  allows  for  a  solid  distribution.  Because  I 
think,  although  this  Fund  is  very  laudable,  the  devil’s  going  to  be 
in the details, and the targeting is going to be extremely important. 
Mr.  GREGG.  The  market  itself  will  ultimately  make  broadband 
available  to  about  85  to  90  percent  of  all  the  households  in  the 
United  States.  It’s  going  to  be  that  remaining  10  to  15  percent  of 
households where it is not economically feasible to have broadband 
made  available,  absent  some  sort  of  explicit  subsidy.  Obviously, 
adding  it  to  the  Universal  Service  Fund  is  a  piece,  tax  breaks  and 
incentives  are  a  piece,  the  RUS  program  of  low-interest  loans  and 
grants  is  a  piece.  There’s  going  to  be  a  multiplicity  of  sources  that 
go  into  making  broadband  available  to  that  final  10  to  15  percent. 
And that is where our efforts should be focused. 

Senator SNOWE. Thank you. 
And finally, I would like to ask, since, we’re, celebrating the 10th 
anniversary  of  the  E-Rate,  and  one  of  the  issues  that  obviously 
emerged  was  the  Antideficiency  Act,  and  Senator  Rockefeller  and 
I  supported  a  permanent  exemption.  Commissioner  Tate,  what’s 
your response to that? Because, otherwise, I don’t know what guar-
antees  there  are  that  we  could  stabilize  the  E-Rate,  under  the  cir-
cumstances, if the ADA were to apply. 

Ms. TATE. Yes. 
Senator  SNOWE.  You  agree  with  that.  They  should  be  a  perma-

nent exemption. That’s the only way to address it. 

Ms. TATE. Well, I’m not sure that I would go so far as to say it’s 

the only way. But I appreciate your efforts to—— 

Senator SNOWE. Yes. 
Ms. TATE.—stabilize that fund. 
Senator SNOWE. Yes. 
Any others? Commissioner Copps? 
Mr. COPPS. I certainly support the—— 
Senator SNOWE. Yes. OK. 
Mr. COPPS.—permanent exemption. 
Senator SNOWE. Right. OK. 
And  finally,  when  it  comes  to,  you  know,  broadband  deployment 
within  the  school  systems  and  classrooms  in  America,  do  we  have 
any  information  with  respect  to  E-Rate.  Because  I  happen  to  be-
lieve  that  we  should  make  the  E-Rate  adaptable  to,  you  know,  the 
technologies of the future. And that includes, obviously, broadband 
deployment  and  the  bandwidths  and  platforms.  Do  we  have  any 
current information with respect to how many classrooms in Amer-
ica  that  might  have  access  to,  you  know,  broadband  deployment? 
Mr.  COPPS.  I  think  we’re  up  in  the  93  or  more  percent  of  class-
rooms  connected,  but  then  you’ve  got  to  ask  yourself,  what’s 
the—— 

Senator SNOWE. Right. 
Mr.  COPPS.—speed  of  the  connection?  And  are  kids  in  rural 
America  going  to  expect  a  dial-up  connection  to  the  rest  of  the 
world, or a true high-speed connection? So, I think the future of the 
E-Rate  is  every  bit  as  important  as  the  past.  It’s  got  a  long  way 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

53 

to  go.  These  are  evolving  and  changing  standards,  and  we  have  to 
make  sure  that  the  E-Rate  program  accommodates  those  changes 
and brings that level of communications to our kids. 

Senator SNOWE. OK. 
Thank you. Appreciate it. 
Senator  STEVENS.  Mr.  Chairman,  could  I  ask  just  one  question? 
The CHAIRMAN. Sure. 
Senator  STEVENS.  It’s  my  understanding  that  in  order  to  utilize 
satellite  delivery  to  consumers  in  isolated  rural  areas,  you’d  need 
a change in the law. Do you agree with that, Mr. Copps? 

Mr.  COPPS.  Not  that  I’m  aware  of.  I  have  seen  broadband  deliv-

ered by satellite. I’ve seen it in—— 

Senator  STEVENS.  I  mean,  Universal  Service  payments,  though. 
Mr.  COPPS.  Oh.  I  am  not  aware  of  there  being  a  problem.  I’ll  be 

happy to look into it and—— 

Senator STEVENS. Thank you. 
Mr. COPPS.—see if there is, but I do not believe there is. I believe 

it should accommodate all of those different technologies. 
The CHAIRMAN. I’d like to thank the panel very much. 
I think it’s obvious to many that I’m a member of the crystal-set 

radio generation. 

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  And,  as  a  result,  I’m  convinced  of  the  dynamic 
and  ever-changing  evolutionary  character  of  communication.  I  am 
one of those who worked upon the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
And,  I  think,  3  months  later  it  was  obsolete.  We  used  the  word 
‘‘Internet’’  twice  in  the  whole  bill.  Now  it’s  part  of  our  vocabulary. 
I will be submitting questions to all of you, because time is of the 

essence, and we have a whole panel waiting. 

But  this  panel  reminded  me  of  an  early  time  in  my  life  when  I 
had a nice chat with a gentleman called Henry J. Kaiser, who was 
making millions every day. And I asked him what is his secret, and 
he  said,  ‘‘It’s  very  simple.  I  never  use  phrases  like,  ‘This  is  an  im-
possible task,’ or I never uses phrases like, ‘This is too complicated.’ 
That’s  a  cop-out.’’  And  I’m  glad  that  none  of  you  have  copped-out, 
in the panel here, the Committee has not copped-out. 

The Vice Chairman has suggested, and I agree with him, that we 
should  have  a  special,  in-depth  briefing  on  broadband,  because,  in 
order  to  cope  with  this  problem,  we’d  better  have  a  real  good  un-
derstanding  of  the  potential,  the  limitations  of  broadband.  And 
we’re going to do that. 

And  so,  with  that,  I’d  like  to  thank  all  of  you  for  your  contribu-
tion.  It’s  been  a  great  session  for  me.  But  I’d  like  to  submit  my 
questions, if I may. 

Thank you very much.

Association, Mr. David Crothers. 

STATEMENT OF DAVID CROTHERS, EXECUTIVE VICE 

PRESIDENT, NORTH DAKOTA ASSOCIATION OF 

TELECOMMUNICATIONS COOPERATIVES 

Mr. CROTHERS. Mr. Chairman, we thank you for the ability to ap-

pear before you today, sir. 

The status of Universal Service is quite possibly the most impor-
tant  issue  facing  our  industry  today.  Restructuring  the  Universal 
Service program properly will be critical to determining whether all 
Americans will have the opportunity to participate in the 21st cen-
tury economy. 

Our  Nation,  however,  finds  itself  in  a  dilemma.  Even  though  it 
is  acknowledged  by  all  that  Americans  increasingly  rely  on  more 
sophisticated communications services and bandwidth for economic, 
healthcare, and educational opportunities, some are looking to limit 
the  growth  and  mission  of  the  program.  While  other  countries  are 
making  the  investment  to  ensure  ubiquitous  broadband  coverage 
for  their  citizens,  the  United  States  remains  a  second-tier  nation, 
in  terms  of  making  a  genuine  commitment  to  broadband  deploy-
ment. It is our position that rather than contemplating ways to cap 
the  Fund,  or  to  otherwise  limit  the  program,  policymakers  should, 
instead, be looking for ways to enhance it and help accelerate such 
deployment. 

Mr.  Chairman,  NTCA  developed  a  national  communications  pol-
icy  course  that  would  move  the  Nation  in  that  direction.  The  plan 
is  forward-looking  and  addresses  our  Nation’s  communications 
needs, especially those in high-cost rural areas of our country. The 
plan  envisions  the  Universal  Service  program  having  an  ongoing 
mission. 

To  see  what  the  Universal  Service  program  has  accomplished,  I 
ask that you look at North Dakota. We believe the state is a perfect 
example of everything that is right with the Universal Service pro-
gram.  Ours  is  a  very  low-density  state.  Independent  rural  tele-
phone  companies  serve  over  96  percent  of  its  geographic  territory. 
That  wasn’t  always  the  case,  however.  In  1996,  large  out-of-state 
telephone companies began selling their highest-cost exchanges. In 
total,  some  90  exchanges  were  sold  in  the  State  over  a  5-year  pe-
riod.  Locally  owned,  locally  operated  telephone  companies  stepped 
up  and  bought  every  one  of  those  exchanges.  The  result  has  been 
greater  levels  of  investment  and  greater  technology  for  rural  resi-
dents in North Dakota. Today, high-speed broadband is provided in 
290  communities  through  a  variety  of  technologies  by  independent 
telephone companies. 

Rural  communications  providers  have  worked  hard  to  ensure 
that rural America will not be relegated to being a communications 
backwater.  This  approach  is  a  stark  contrast  to  the  array  of  inter-
ests  that  wish  to  mold  the  program  into  something  that  it  was 
never intended to be: a mechanism to ensure competitive neutrality

or  to  create  government-subsidized  competition  where  there  would 
otherwise have none existing. 

This  blind  pursuit  of  competition  for  competition’s  sake  has  al-
lowed  the  Universal  Service  program  to  be  accessed  by  those  who 
have  no  real  commitment  to  the  policy  of  Universal  Service.  Even 
FCC Chairman Martin and Verizon, both proponents of alternative 
approaches to controlling the program’s growth, have acknowledged 
the cause of the growth is the CETC segment of the industry. Con-
sequently, the Fund’s growth has been rapid, and, some say, politi-
cally unsustainable. 

Today,  there  are  countless  plans  under  consideration  to  control 
the growth of the Universal Service program. Most of them, includ-
ing  the  auction  concept  proposed  by  Verizon,  ignore  the  real  root 
of  the  problem.  NTCA’s  approach  makes  far  more  sense,  in  our 
judgment:  expand  the  base  of  USF  contributors,  strengthen  the 
public-interest  requirements  for  ETC  designation,  and  eliminate 
the  identical  support  rule.  Each  of  these  proposals  could  easily  be 
implemented and would absolutely control the program’s growth. 

Just  last  week  at  an  FCC  forum,  the  subject  of  reverse  auctions 
was once again cited as the solution to many of the Universal Serv-
ice  Fund’s  programs.  The  concept  of  reverse  auctions  is  to  limit 
support to the lowest-cost provider. This argument is the antithesis 
of  Universal  Service.  Auctions  will  lead  us  down  the  road  of  sup-
porting  the  lowest  common  denominator.  It  is  truly  a  race  to  the 
bottom. 

Rural  communications  providers  have  a  quality-of-service  ap-
proach  to  network  construction,  and  it  has  allowed  the  people  of 
rural  America  to  enjoy  a  state-of-the-art  infrastructure  at  afford-
able  rates.  Alternatively,  the  other  technologies  and  services,  such 
as  wireless  voice  technologies  and  VoIP,  are  built  and  operated  at 
far  less  stringent  standards,  and  use  the  infrastructure  of  others. 
The  great  misconception  continues  to  exist  that  wireless  handsets 
are  communicating  directly  to  another  wireless  handset  or  to  a 
tower, or through a tower to another party. Mr. Chairman, wireless 
needs  wires.  Universal  Service  support  ensures  that  there  is  a 
state-of-the-art  underlying  network  upon  which  all  these  services 
can rely. Reverse auctions will not ensure this. 

We ask, are we willing to risk allowing the almost limitless band-
width  capacities  associated  with  wireline  to  be  undermined?  And 
what  will  happen,  we  ask,  with  reverse  auctions,  when  a  carrier 
other  than  the  incumbent  wins  the  auction?  Without  this  stream 
of  support,  the  rural  incumbents,  in  many  cases,  will  no  longer  be 
functional.  And  we  fear,  when  repeated  winners  of  those  auctions 
replace one another over and over, and the lack of investment that 
will  follow.  Sadly,  it  will  be  the  American  citizen  who  suffers  the 
consequences of these short-term fixes. 

Mr.  Chairman,  today  we  are  on  the  cusp  of  fully  moving  into  a 
world where data, video, and mobility are the primary objectives of 
consumers. The technologies of tomorrow, though, will still be reli-
ant on the underlying wireline voice network of today. 

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  allowing  us  to  appear  before  you 

today.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID CROTHERS, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, 

NORTH DAKOTA ASSOCIATION OF TELEPHONE COOPERATIVES 

Mr. Chairman, you have convened us here today to consider the status and future 
of our national Universal Service policy and its underlying support mechanism. The 
discussion  surrounding  this  venerable  policy  is  nothing  new  and  indeed  has  per-
sisted,  and  evolved,  much  as  the  program  itself  has,  and  should.  While  this  con-
versation  has  at  times  been  exhausting,  and  at  others  outright  exasperating,  the 
Nation’s  small  and  rural  community  based  communications  providers  welcome  and 
embrace  it  nonetheless.  We  do  so  because  such  dialogue  only  serves  to  strengthen 
and  improve  this  long-standing  national  policy—a  policy  that  plays  a  critical  role 
in  maintaining  and  expanding  the  communications  infrastructure  that  is  so  nec-
essary  to  our  national  and  economic  security.  So  thank  you  Mr.  Chairman  for  your 
ongoing efforts to ensure the goal of Universal Service remains the solid cornerstone 
of our national communications policy that it has always been. 

Do  we  still  need  this  program?  The  answer  to  that  question  is  an  emphatic  yes! 
More  and  more  Americans  rely  on  communications  every  day  to  meet  their  com-
merce,  security  and  entertainment  needs.  The  bar  for  the  21st  century  communica-
tions  has  been  raised.  More  bandwidth  must  be  deployed  in  our  networks  so  all 
American households, urban and rural alike, can benefit from education, healthcare, 
and economic opportunities that are dependent upon a robust communications plat-
form. 

Other  countries  of  the  world  understand  the  need  to  make  a  financial  commit-
ment  now  to  ensure  adequate  bandwidth  in  their  communications  networks.  This 
will provide their citizens with opportunities for economic growth and global partici-
pation.  Rather  than  working  on  ways  to  cap  Universal  Service  Funds,  particularly 
to  wireline  network  providers  that  have  deployed  critical  backbone  infrastructure, 
the  Congress  should  be  looking  for  ways  to  expand  the  fund,  thereby  encouraging 
an accelerated deployment of broadband facilities throughout America. 

Some  question  the  continued  need  for  universal  service.  To  these  doubters,  I  in-
vite  you  to  visit  my  state  of  North  Dakota  and  see  the  incredible  accomplishments 
of this program for yourself. I can, without question, assure this committee that the 
Universal Service Fund is more necessary today than ever before. 

It is important when discussing Universal Service to approach it from the proper 
perspective. Detractors and supporters alike cannot deny that the Universal Service 
system  is  a  shining  example  of  successful  national  policy.  This  program  is  largely 
responsible  for  the  extremely  high  communications  connectivity  our  Nation  enjoys 
today. It is due to Universal Service support that virtually any American that wish-
es  to  have  voice  connectivity  is  able  to.  Likewise  it  is  largely  due  to  this  program 
that  such  connectivity  is  uniform  in  price  and  scope  regardless  of  where  you  live. 
For more than a decade now our industry has been exposed to an operating envi-
ronment marked by competition and deregulation. These concepts are in many ways 
in  direct  conflict  with  the  policy  of  universal  service.  Universal  Service  of  course  is 
about  developing  the  appropriate  policy  environment  to  ensure  all  Americans  have 
access  to  communications  services  of  an  equitable  price  and  scope.  The  very  nature 
of the Universal Service concept does not allow for the ‘‘let the chips fall where they 
may’’ theory associated with competition and deregulation. 

The rural segment of the industry has always understood the reality that the poli-
cies  of  competition  and  deregulation  will  be  ineffective  if  simply  broad  brushed 
across all spectrums of the marketplace. Yet, when confronted with the policies, we 
have  simultaneously  embraced  and/or  tackled  them  with  vigor.  This  response  is  in 
stark contrast to the array of entities from the private and public sectors alike that 
continue trying to mold the Universal Service program into something it was never 
intended  to  be—a  mechanism  for  ensuring  competitive  neutrality.  Herein  lays  the 
debate about where this program stands today, and where it should go in the future. 
Unfortunately,  while  the  Congressional  intent  of  the  Telecommunications  Act  of 
1996 that led to the emergence of these conflicting policies was quite clear the man-
ner in which it has been interpreted is quite another story. Competitors, state regu-
lators,  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC),  and  yes  even  some  of  your 
Congressional colleagues have upset the delicate dichotomy that was to have existed 
between the distinct concepts. The result is a disastrous situation where, under the 
guise of establishing an environment of competitive neutrality, the program is being 
accessed  by  many  that  have  no  real  commitment  to  the  policy  of  universal  service. 
Consequently,  its  growth  has  been  rapid  and  is  currently  at  a  politically 
unsustainable rate which is the root of why we are here today. 

Mr. Chairman, so often throughout the course of this debate, people have directed 
the industry, and particularly small rural carriers, to ‘‘think outside the box’’ in our 
search  for  solutions  to  the  fix  we  find  ourselves  in  today.  The  comment  might  be

amusing  were  it  not  so  completely  oblivious  to  our  way  of  thinking  and  operating 
each  and  every  day  of  our  existence.  If  I  do  nothing  else  here  this  morning,  it  is 
my  overarching  desire  to  ensure  that  everyone  participating  and  listening  to  this 
discussion ultimately leaves with the recognition and understanding that rural car-
riers  do  and  always  will  ‘‘think  outside  the  box.’’  Truly,  they  have  no  other  choice. 
What segment of the industry was the first to have completely converted to digital 
switched  systems?  What  segment  of  the  industry  was  a  pioneer  in  providing  wire-
less options to their hardest to reach customers? From what segment of the industry 
did  the  first  company  to  deploy  an  all  fiber  system  come?  What  segment  of  the  in-
dustry  was  the  first  to  offer  distance  learning  and  tele-health  applications?  What 
segment  of  the  industry  was  an  early  leader  in  providing  cable-based  video,  then 
satellite  video,  and  now  IP  video  to  their  markets?  What  segment  of  the  industry 
quickly  moved  into  Internet  service  provision  in  the  early  stages  of  the  Internet’s 
public evolution? And what segment of the industry continues to lead in the deploy-
ment of high-speed broadband capable infrastructure? 

Mr. Chairman in every instance the answer to those questions is—the small rural 
segment of the industry. Many might be asking why these carriers care or have this 
unique  perspective  and  approach  to  their  mission.  The  answer  to  that  question  is 
relatively  simple.  Because  these  systems  are  owned  and  operated  by  the  members 
of  the  community  in  the  case  of  cooperatives,  or  by  members  from  the  community 
in the case of commercial systems. Clearly as a result they are entrepreneurs. Clear-
ly they are continually ‘‘thinking outside the box.’’ 

But, does thinking outside the box mean we should automatically discount the ob-
vious?  Frankly,  it  is  astounding  to  us  at  how  great  the  zeal  of  some  is  to  do  just 
that.  Today  there  are  countless  plans  under  development  and  already  on  the  table 
directed  at  how  to  control  the  growth  of  the  Universal  Service  program.  They  are 
Byzantine  in  their  detail  and  approach  to  eventually  get  to  the  end-point  desired. 
Even  worse,  such  plans  also  completely  ignore  the  most  obvious,  basic,  and  easy 
to  implement  responses.  Expanding  the  system’s  assessment  base—strengthening 
the  requirements  for  receiving  eligible  telecommunications  carrier  (ETC)  status— 
eliminating the identical support rule which provides competitors with inflated sup-
port—all  concepts  that  could  easily  be  implemented  and  that  we  know  for  certain 
would produce the desired result. 

Evidently  not  in  the  minds  of  many  as  was  evidenced  just  last  week  at  an  FCC 
forum  as  well  as  during  the  course  of  the  NARUC  meeting.  A  great  many  voices 
continue  to  sing  the  praises  of  the  reverse  auction  concept.  This  approach  seeks  to 
limit  support  to  the  lowest  cost  and/or  most  efficient  technology.  This  argument  is 
the  antithesis  of  the  goal  of  Universal  Service  which  I  mentioned  is  to  ensure  ALL 
Americans have access to communications services that are comparable in price and 
scope. 

Auctions  would  presumably  lead  us  down  the  road  of  supporting  the  lowest  com-
mon  denominator.  Again,  the  exact  opposite  of  what  Universal  Service  was  struc-
tured  to  accomplish.  Traditionally,  rural  communications  system  have  been  built 
and constructed to extremely exacting standards. While the law requires that rural 
Americans receive no less, the Universal Service system and other cost recovery pro-
grams,  as  well  as  private  financiers  demand  no  less.  This  Quality  of  Service  (QoS) 
approach to network construction and management is the formula that has allowed 
our industry to build and maintain the infrastructure that is an integral part of the 
premiere communications system our Nation enjoys today. 

However, today, many alternative technologies and services to traditional wireline 
voice  service  are  built  and  operated  according  to  far  less  stringent  standards.  For 
example,  it  is  a  well  accepted  fact  that  wireless  voice  technologies  generally  do  not 
approach  the  QoS  standards  of  wireline  calls.  Another  example  is  Voice  over  Inter-
net  Protocol  (VoIP)  oriented  service  which  is  even  further  away  from  meeting  the 
QoS standards of wireline voice service. 

There  is  one  more  critically  important  reason  for  the  inferior  nature  of  some  of 
these  alternative  technologies.  They  do  not  consist  entirely  of  their  own  infrastruc-
ture.  For  example,  with  regard  to  wireless  service,  a  great  misconception  continues 
to  exist  among  policymakers  and  the  public  alike,  that  wireless  hand  sets  are  com-
municating directly to one another or directly to a wireless tower and directly from 
that  tower  to  another  party.  This  is  simply  not  the  case.  Wireless  needs  wires  Mr. 
Chairman.  Whether  it’s  the  wires  to  complete  a  wireless  to  wireline  call  or  a  wire-
less  to  wireless  call,  there  are  wires  involved  at  some  point  in  the  call’s  path.  The 
great  majority  of  these  wires  are  owned  and  operated  by  the  incumbent  voice  pro-
viders. 

Likewise  with  the  VoIP  voice  services  we  hear  so  much  about  today,  these  sys-
tems  rely  almost  entirely  upon  the  infrastructure  of  others,  and  to  this  point  that 
infrastructure  has  generally  been  the  last  mile  connections  of  wireline  carriers  and 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

58 

the  Internet  system.  An  interesting  point  to  make  here  is  that  due  to  ineffective 
statutes and regulations, services such as this are allowed to utilize this infrastruc-
ture that belongs to others without paying for such use. They are using the facilities 
of rural providers, and are not paying to do so. Without such compensation, the abil-
ity  of  network  owners  to  continue  to  invest  in  their  networks  is  put  in  jeopardy. 
Without such investment we will eventually reach the point at which such facilities 
will not function. Without such facilities being able to effectively operate, many ap-
plications such as wireless and VoIP services would be unable to operate. 

Which  bring  us  back  to  reverse  auctions.  Universal  service  support  ensures  the 
continuum  of  the  underlying  network  upon  which  all  other  services  rely.  Auctions 
fail to ensure that such support will continue to be provided. Are we willing to risk 
allowing  the  almost  limitless  bandwidth  capacities  associated  with  a  wireline  net-
work to be undermined simply because policymakers choose to make an easy policy 
decision  with  wide-ranging  long-term  implications  rather  than  buckling  down  and 
confronting  the  real  underlying  issues  associated  with  universal  service?  There  are 
other  questions  with  the  reverse  auction  concept  as  well.  How  will  efficiency  be  de-
termined  and  measured?  Providing  support  to  the  system  with  the  lowest  upfront 
costs may appear efficient today but what about over the long-term? 

What happens when a carrier other than the incumbent wins the Universal Serv-
ice  support?  Without  this  stream  of  cost  recovery,  most  rural  incumbents  would  be 
hard  pressed  to  remain  operationally  functional.  What  becomes  of  their  underlying 
infrastructure  that  is  necessary  to  the  operations  of  alternative  technologies?  What 
happens in the future when other providers consistently and repeatedly emerge that 
are  lower  cost  than  the  prior?  Do  we  find  ourselves  stuck  in  a  process  of  unending 
churn  of  providers?  Wouldn’t  such  instability  destine  such  providers  to  never  being 
able  to  secure  the  long-term  financing  that  is  so  necessary  to  this  capital  intensive 
business? 

Finally, are policymakers themselves really up to the challenges that reverse auc-
tions  present.  It’s  easy  to  talk  about  a  lowest  cost  bidder  approach  saving  money. 
However,  we  think  parties  to  such  an  initiative  would  quickly  realize  the  fallacies 
behind this concept were it ever implemented. No American, whether rural or urban 
based,  would  be  well  served  by  reverse  auctions.  Indeed,  I  would  like  to  submit  for 
the record a far more extensive paper on this subject. It was prepared at the request 
of  the  National  Telecommunications  Cooperative  Association  by  Dale  Lehman  who 
is  the  Director  of  the  Executive  MBA  in  Information  and  Communication  Tech-
nology at the Alaska Pacific University. 

No,  Mr.  Chairman,  as  I  alluded  earlier,  there  are  far  better,  more  reasonable, 
more  realistic,  and  more  workable  options  that  will  best  ensure  the  proper  applica-
tion and future operation of the Universal Service system. Indeed, many such ideas 
and concepts were contained in the Universal Service section of the Communications 
Act  of  2006  that  this  committee  marked  up  late  last  year.  That  legislation  was  the 
product  of  input  from  many  policymakers  and  many  sectors  of  the  industry.  Please 
allow me to just highlight its stronger provisions: 

• Establishing a new definition of ‘‘communications service’’ that alleviates the ar-
bitrage  of  certain  carriers  wiggling  out  from  under  their  Universal  Service  re-
sponsibilities; 

• Expanding the base of contributors to the Universal Service Fund (USF) which 

will lower the overall USF assessment for all consumers; 

• Providing  flexibility  in  how  the  FCC  assesses  providers  for  their  contributions, 
which  allows  consideration  of  new  technologies  and  services  as  well  as  modern 
modes of communications; 

• Giving  states  new  flexibility  for  their  appropriate  management  of  their  state 

Universal Service funds; 

• Codifying  new  minimum  guidelines  for  receiving  the  eligible  communications 

carrier status necessary to receive Universal Service support; 

• Permanently  prohibiting  the  FCC  from  limiting  Universal  Service  support  to  a 
single  primary  line,  which  ensures  rural  America’s  small  businesses  remain 
competitive; 

• Permanently  exempting  the  program  from  the  Anti-Deficiency  Act  and  perma-
nently removing the private fund from the Federal budget process which would 
preclude the program from experiencing future short falls or spikes in Fund as-
sessments; 

• Clarifies  an  entity  is  not  exempt  from  contributing  to  the  system  solely  on  the 

basis that it does not receive support from the program;

averaging provisions that are in current law; 

• Establishing  that  equivalent  services  must  live  up  to  the  geographic  toll  rate 
• Ensuring  a  smooth  conversion  resulting  from  any  new  regulations  or  statutes 
affecting  the  program  by  requiring  the  FCC  to  adopt  transition  mechanisms  of 
not less than 5 years for any changes in the Universal Service distribution proc-
ess. 

Were there areas that could have been stronger? No question, after all, the entire 
bill, as in most legislative instances, was a conglomeration of compromise. Yet there 
was  one  key  area  that  was  initially  stronger  that  was  weakened  as  it  moved 
through  the  mark-up  process.  The  earliest  drafts  of  the  bill  directly  set  the  stage 
for  the  Universal  Service  system  to  begin  formally  supporting  the  deployment  of 
broadband and advanced services capable infrastructure. This is a key issue. 

Today we are on the cusp of fully moving into a world where data, video, and mo-
bility  are  the  primary  objectives  of  consumers  and  voice  will  be  secondary,  or  even 
an  afterthought.  Remember  my  earlier  discussion  that  pointed  out  how  most  alter-
native technologies are reliant upon the underlying wireline voice network. Well the 
same holds true here. Regardless of whether consumers are focused on voice or some 
other  form  of  communication,  they  will  still  require  the  underlying  infrastructure 
to  ensure  their  communication  gets  to  its  destination.  The  only  difference  is  that 
with  regard  to  broadband  and  advanced  services  capable  infrastructure,  the  costs 
and subsequent need for support are even greater than they are for voice only infra-
structure. 

There was one other omission with regard to the legislation that would have gone 
a  long  way  in  controlling  the  growth  of  the  program  and  that  was  the  elimination 
of  the  identical  support  rule.  For  those  of  you  that  are  unfamiliar  with  this  issue, 
the  FCC’s  rules  currently  allow  competitive  ETCs  to  receive  Universal  Service  sup-
port  based  on  the  costs  of  incumbent  carriers.  So  in  the  case  of  a  carrier  with  ex-
tremely high costs, a competitor can secure a Universal Service designation for that 
market  and  receive  the  exact  same  dollars  per  consumer  even  if  their  costs  are  a 
fraction  of  the  incumbents.  It  is  a  terrible  waste  of  funds  and  is  a  rule  that  should 
have been changed yesterday. 

Mr.  Chairman,  as  a  concluding  thought  I  would  just  like  to  reiterate  what  many 
of  us  already  know  Universal  Service  is  not.  Universal  service  support  is  neither  a 
subsidy  nor  a  tax.  Universal  service  support  is  an  industry  funded  cost  recovery 
mechanism that offsets the higher cost to build and maintain vital communications 
networks  in  rural,  sparsely  populated,  and  insular  portions  of  our  Nation.  No  Fed-
eral monies are appropriated for this purpose. 

America stands at a crossroads between a narrowband and broadband world. The 
choice is clear. I can assure you that I and the entire rural segment of the industry 
that  is  associated  with  NTCA  and  the  other  rural  communications  associations  are 
ready  to  work  with  you  to  move  forward  aggressively  with  a  national  plan  to  bring 
broadband to all Americans as is envisioned by so many. Thank you.

The  Use  of  Reverse  Auctions  for  Provision  of  Universal  Service—Dale  E. 

Lehman, Ph.D.1 

This  paper  reviews  the  theoretical  and  applied  literature  on  the  use  of  reverse 
auctions  (also  called  minimum  subsidy  auctions  or  competitive  auctions)  for  provi-
sion of universal service. It reveals that reverse auctions are feasible, and have met 
with  some  success,  for  provision  of  new  infrastructure/services  into  previously 
unserved  areas,  or  for  the  upgrading  of  existing  infrastructure  and/or  services.  In 
contrast,  the  U.S.  environment  is  one  in  which  there  are  multiple  existing  service 
providers,  using  a  diverse  set  of  technologies,  in  most  supported  areas.  Existing  in-
frastructure  requires  (i)  a  transition  mechanism  to  recover  past  prudent  invest-
ments  made  to  serve  high-cost  areas;  and  (ii)  increases  the  difficulty  of  creating  an 
auction  that  is  not  biased  in  favor  of  any  set  of  current  infrastructure  providers 
(particularly if they utilize different technologies). Unfortunately, there is scant em-
pirical  evidence  on  which  to  determine  the  feasibility  or  desirability  of  reverse  auc-

tions relative to alternative methods of providing Universal Service under these con-
ditions. 

The  use  of  auctions  to  award  provision  of  utility  services  can  be  traced  back  to 
Demsetz (1968). Demsetz introduced the notion that franchise bidding could replace 
traditional public utility regulation. Particular use for provision of universal service, 
or  carrier  of  last  resort  (COLR)  responsibilities,  was  first  explored  by  Milgrom  in 
his  1996  Nobel  lecture  in  honor  of  William  Vickrey,  and  was  first  suggested  for  ex-
amination  by  the  FCC  in  1995.  Considerable  academic  and  practitioner  work  has 
been conducted on auctions since that time, especially in conjunction with the wide-
spread use of auctions for awarding the right to use spectrum resources. In addition, 
there  is  a  lengthy  literature  surrounding  the  use  of  competitive  bidding  for  award-
ing  contracts  (e.g,  Defense  Department  procurements,  public  works  construction, 
etc.)  which  are  a  discrete  form  of  an  auction  (in  which  a  single  project  or  set  of 
projects is awarded on the basis of a competitive bidding process). 

The  use  of  competitive  processes  has  a  number  of  general  beneficial  properties: 
they promote incentives for cost-reducing innovation, they mitigate against informa-
tional asymmetries between funding entities and entities contracted to provide serv-
ices  on  their  behalf,  auctions  can  be  used  to  ration  scarce  resources  to  those  that 
value them the most, and they can permit market forces to play a role in the deter-
mination  of  the  quality  of  services  provided.  Competitive  contracts  are  not  a  pan-
acea,  however.  Victor  Goldberg  (1976)  points  out  that  competitive  procurement  and 
alternative regulatory mechanisms should be compared under realistic conditions re-
lated to the nature of the service that is being provided. 

Goldberg  provides  the  example  of  a  university  food  service  that  might  be  con-
tracted out on the basis of a competitive bid, or could be provided internally by the 
university  itself.  The  latter  is  meant  to  approximate  the  conditions  under  which  a 
regulated  utility  operates.  Regulators  must  monitor  the  quality  and  cost  of  service 
provision,  and  face  a  number  of  potential  inefficiencies  inherent  in  monopoly  provi-
sion by an agent with better information than the principal. Competitive bidding re-
duces only some of these problems, and creates some new issues. Quality of service 
must still be monitored, and there are administrative costs associated with both the 
awarding and oversight of contracts. 

Goldberg  points  out  that  administered  contracts,  traditional  regulation,  or  any 
other  regulatory  mechanism  must  balance  the  right  of  consumers  to  be  served  and 
the right of providers to serve. Universal Service is a statement of the public’s right 
to  be  served  (at  comparable  rates  for  comparable  services,  in  high  cost  and  insular 
areas,  and  for  consumers  of  low  income),  and  regulators  become  the  agent  of  these 
consumers’ rights. At the same time, providers have the right to an opportunity for 
a competitive return on their investments. 

Goldberg’s  key  insight  is  that  the  nature  of  the  service  itself,  and  not  the  par-
ticular  way  in  which  contracts  are  awarded  (competitive  bidding  or  regulated  mo-
nopoly,  for  example),  is  what  determines  the  key  issues  that  must  be  dealt  with. 
Significant investment costs raise issues associated with the need to establish long- 
term  contracts.  Volatile  operating  costs  (e.g.,  fuel  costs)  would  raise  issues  of  risk, 
regardless of the regulatory mechanism that is adopted. 

This principle is pertinent to the use of reverse auctions for provision of universal 
service.  Provision  of  Universal  Service  entails  significant  investment  costs  (sunk 
costs to a degree that depends on the technology deployed) under conditions of con-
tinual  technological  progress.  Services  are  provided  to  consumers  for  which  the  de-
mand  falls  short  of  the  provisioning  costs.2 In  the  U.S.  there  are  few  unserved 
areas:  instead,  there  are  multiple  networks,  using  different  technologies  and  with 
different quality attributes, and serving different parts of rural areas. There are also 
a  variety  of  regulatory  restrictions  placed  on  existing  rural  service  providers.  The 
potential use of auctions must be evaluated against a backdrop of these characteris-
tics. 

This paper will review the theoretical literature and applied evidence, and is orga-
nized according to a number of related issues that must be resolved in order to im-
plement reverse auctions for universal service. These include: 

• Definition of the service to be auctioned. 
• Size of areas to be defined. 
• Number of COLRs to be subsidized. 
• Time period for contract awards. 

2 This can either result from consumer unwillingness or inability to pay the full cost of provi-
sion, or from public policy that limits their price to be less than these costs. In either case, mar-
ket provision will be insufficiently forthcoming, absent some form of support.

• Transition/stranded investment issues. 
• Bidder eligibility. 
• Type  of  bidding  to  be  conducted  (sealed  or  open,  single  or  multiple  round, 
• Basis for determining winning bids. 
• Pricing and service flexibility accompanying awards.

Each topic has a number of feasible alternatives. In a comparison of reverse auc-
tions  and  cost  proxy  model-based  USF,  Sorana  (1998)  states  that  ‘‘it  can  be  easily 
seen  that  the  two  mechanisms  cannot  be  ranked  on  purely  theoretical  grounds.’’ 3 
Similarly, theory alone cannot determine the desirability of reverse auctions for uni-
versal service. 

I  examine  the  theoretical  guidance  and  empirical  evidence  that  is  available  from 
the  applications  of  reverse  auctions  in  telecommunications  (and  some  limited  rel-
evant  experiences  in  other  industries).  A  recurring  theme  will  be  that  the  com-
plexity of these decisions increases significantly in the presence of an existing infra-
structure (rather than a ‘‘green-field’’ application), and when competing service pro-
viders use different technologies (with different cost and quality characteristics). 
Service Definition 

The  definition  of  Universal  Service  will  need  to  be  specific  in  terms  of  service 
quality,  coverage,  and  capabilities.  In  particular,  it  will  need  to  specify  whether 
equal access is to be included, appropriate service quality standards (e.g., system re-
liability), and what data speed is to be supported. This is one area in which auctions 
may be less desirable than the current USF mechanism. 

Under  current  rules,  the  delivery  of  services  can  outpace  the  definition  of  uni-
versal  service:  for  example,  higher  broadband  speeds  may  be  available,  even  while 
broadband  is  not  included  within  the  definition  of  universal  service.  An  auction 
mechanism  may  not  permit  this  outcome—the  carrier’s  business  case  will  need  to 
support  the  service  delivered.  If  policymakers  want  to  see  faster  deployment,  then 
they will need a specific auction for their desired rate of deployment. 

Broadband is not part of today’s Universal Service definition, and the FCC’s defi-
nition of broadband service is relatively slow by today’s standards. Many rural car-
riers  provide  broadband  speeds  well  in  excess  of  256k,  and  often  in  the  absence  of 
sufficient market demand to justify the deployment costs of these higher speeds, on 
a  narrow  profitability  criterion.  The  justification  for  providing  these  services  rests 
on their economic importance to the rural community served, and the ability to pro-
vide these services is facilitated by USF. 

It  is  precisely  because  of  the  strong  cost-reducing  incentives  of  reverse  auctions 
that the service definition must be precise. This means that regulators must predict 
service  needs  at  least  as  far  into  the  future  as  the  time  period  that  the  franchise 
will cover. The need for such regulatory foresight undermines some of the principal 
theoretical  advantages  of  reverse  auctions—that  they  potentially  replace  regulatory 
fiat with market processes. 

Coverage is another key part of service definition. It is not feasible to define Uni-
versal Service as availability to 100 percent of the population. Reduced targets, such 
as  90  percent,  however,  do  not  sound  like  Universal  Service.  For  many  years,  tele-
phone companies have operated under state-specific requirements to provide service 
to  any  location  within  X  miles  (usually  a  fairly  small  number)  of  their  current  net-
work  facilities.  Special  construction  charges  apply  to  locations  that  exceed  X,  with 
the costs usually borne by the party requesting service. Given that this practice has 
been  built  into  construction  plans,  it  seems  that  continuing  this  practice  would  be 
least disruptive to consumers. 
Size of Areas 

A  fundamental  principle  for  an  auction  to  be  efficient  is  that  the  item  being  auc-
tioned must be the same for all bidders (their individual valuations may differ, but 
the  item  being  auctioned  must  be  the  same  if  the  bids  are  to  be  compared).  This 
means that the coverage area must be the same for all COLR bidders. 

Theoretical  work  also  suggests  that  there  may  be  subtle  strategic  effects  as  geo-
graphical  coverage  differs  across  competing  providers.  If  one  provider  is  obligated 
to  serve  all  customers  at  the  same  price,  and  the  other  carrier  can  serve  a  subset 
of  customers,  the  COLR  carrier  must  be  reimbursed  for  reduced  profits  on  the  con-
tested part of the market as well as the higher costs of serving the uncontested con-

sumers  [Hoernig  and  Valletti  (2003)].  The  strategic  considerations  go  further  and 
can  ‘‘raise  the  subsidy  substantially,  and  even  may  leave  both  firms  with  higher 
profits than if they were just serving the urban market.’’ 4 More generally, differen-
tial serving areas and COLR obligations create strategic incentives which will influ-
ence  the  level  of  competition  between  carriers.  Theoretical  work  has  thus  far  been 
constrained  to  the  case  of  an  incumbent  competing  with  a  new  entrant—the  case 
of competing existing COLRs has not been modeled. Strategic considerations and in-
formation asymmetries have yet to be analyzed in this environment. 

The  next  question  is  whether  these  areas  should  be  large  or  small.  When  there 
are potentially significant cost complementarities (costs depend on the specific com-
bination  of  areas  that  a  service  provider  will  serve),  then  there  are  two  options:  (i) 
auction  a  large  enough  areas  to  include  most  of  the  significant  complementarities; 
or (ii) auction many smaller areas, but permit for combinatorial bidding so that sig-
nificant complementarities can be realized. There appears to be some dispute about 
the  feasibility  of  (ii)  [Kelly  and  Steinberg  (1998)  claim  that  complex  combinatorial 
auctions  are  feasible,  but  Hultkrantz  (2004)  cites  Kelly  and  Steinberg’s  work,  but 
concludes  that  ‘‘the  consensus  in  the  economic  literature  seems  to  be  that 
combinatorial  auctions  have  several  desirable  properties  but  are  too  difficult  to  be 
used;’’  Sorana  (1998)  claims  ‘‘it  must  be  ultimately  recognized,  however,  that  the 
theoretical and experimental properties of multi-unit auctions, combinatorial or oth-
erwise,  are  not  well  understood,’’  and  Luander  and  Nilsson  (2004)  provide  experi-
mental evidence that combinatorial auctions may be more efficient and make collu-
sion more difficult than one shot sealed auctions]. 

Large area auctions would appear to favor larger carriers, or would require small-
er  carriers  to  bid  jointly  in  order  to  compete.5 Larger  areas  that  make  sense  from 
a network perspective may also require a mixture of areas currently served by rural 
and  nonrural  carriers.  This  would  exacerbate  the  complexity  of  designing  joint  bids 
to  serve  large  areas.  It  may  also  increase  the  size  of  the  Fund  by  including  high- 
cost areas (currently served by nonrural carriers) that do not presently receive sup-
port. 

In  general,  smaller  areas  should  involve  more  precise  and  larger  Universal  Serv-
ice  funds,  ceteris  paribus.  Larger  areas  involve  more  averaging  of  relatively  high 
and relatively low cost customers, tending to decrease the overall fund size, but fail-
ing  to  provide  full  support  for  high-cost  areas  [Lehman  (2000)].  Smaller  areas  nec-
essarily involve the complexities of combinatorial bidding. 

The averaging effect can be substantial. At the extreme, imagine a single national 
service area being auctioned off—a subsidy would probably not be required to serve 
the  high-cost  areas  along  with  the  low  cost  areas.  This  result,  however,  is  a  move 
away from decades of efforts aimed at increasing competition in the industry. If auc-
tions  are  designed  to  accommodate  large  areas  and  competition  within  these  areas, 
then  the  overall  Fund  cost  will  be  driven  upwards,  as  discussed  below  under  the 
number of COLRs. 

Determination  of  geographical  areas  to  be  auctioned  is  complicated  by  the  pres-
ence  of  multiple  existing  network  infrastructures.  For  example,  suppose  that  the 
COLR includes service to 100 percent of the customers within a current ILEC serv-
ing  area  and  that  a  wireless  carrier  wishes  to  bid,  but  their  network  only  covers 
80  percent  of  the  population  in  that  area.  The  wireless  carrier  would  be  required 
to arrange to resell the incumbent’s service or provide an alternative infrastructure 
for the 20 percent of customers that it does not currently reach. 

Conversely,  suppose  the  service  area  is  defined  as  the  wireless  carrier’s  service 
area,  and  that  this  extends  beyond  any  single  ILEC’s  service  area.  This  would  re-
quire several ILECs to combine their bids to match the service area of the wireless 
carrier.  In  either  case,  transactions  costs  and  uncertainty  will  increase  when  exist-
ing infrastructures do not match.6 

4 Hoernig and Valletti (2003) at page 91. 
5 Current  spectrum  auctions  highlight  this  issue.  Joint  bidding  is  permitted,  but  the  bidders 
cannot subsequently use the spectrum rights individually, under their separate business identi-
ties.  Auction  design  should  avoid  dictating  market  structure—it  should  reveal  when  joint  bid-
ding is most efficient, but it should not force carriers to consolidate operations. Forced consolida-
tion presupposes that regulators know the most efficient market structure to begin with, under-
mining the potential of auctions to substitute market processes for regulatory processes. 

6 The 1999 NPRM cited the use of competitive bids for COLR in Hawaii. The first such award 
went to TelHawaii. In order to transfer the assets from the previous COLR, GTE Hawaiian Tel, 
the Public Utilities Commission of Hawaii condemned some of the assets of GTE Hawaiian Tel. 
Several court battles later, a state court overturned the condemnation as unconstitutional. Rath-
er  than  continue  the  legal  battles,  TelHawaii  pulled  out  of  the  market  after  spending  millions 
of dollars attempting to enter [Honolulu Star-Bulletin, July 20, 1999]. Regardless of the ultimate

It is difficult to design an auction that will be technologically neutral under these 
circumstances. To avoid bias, areas would need to be smaller than anybody’s current 
service  area,  thereby  placing  a  similar  burden  on  all  potential  bidders.  However, 
such  small  areas  would  greatly  increase  the  complexity  of  the  combinatorial  auc-
tions that would be required. 
Number of COLRs 

Closely  related  to  defining  the  geographic  COLR  area  is  the  issue  of  whether 
there will be one winning bid or more than one within each area. At a fundamental 
level,  there  is  a  tradeoff  between  competition  for  the  market  (favored  by  a  single 
winning  bidder)  and  competition  within  the  market  (promoted  by  multiple  winning 
bidders).  A  priori,  it  is  not  clear  which  type  of  competition  would  lead  to  greater 
economic efficiency. 

It is clear that total subsidies will be larger with multiple winning bids than sin-
gle winners. This is evident from the GTE reverse auction proposal submitted to the 
FCC  [Weller  (1998)].  Weller  proposed  that  bidders  submit  two  bids—one  for  sole 
provision  of  COLR  within  an  area  and  the  other  assuming  shared  provision  of 
COLR  responsibilities.  Preliminary  evidence  was  that  reducing  a  carrier’s  market 
share by 50 percent would increase unit costs by 52 percent. This is due to the fact 
that  network  investment  is  not  proportional  to  the  number  of  customers,  particu-
larly  in  sparsely  populated  areas.  Serving  half  of  the  customers  may  entail  nearly 
the same infrastructure as serving all of the customers. 

It  should  be  noted  that  some  technologies  may  be  more  tolerant  than  others  of 
multiple  winning  bidders.  Wireless  technology  does  not  have  the  same  sunk  cost 
characteristics as wireline technology, so per unit subsidies may not increase as dra-
matically  for  wireless  carriers.  This  need  not  cause  a  problem  as  long  as  the 
wireline  bidder  can  receive  a  subsidy  adequate  to  serve  a  partial  market  share.  If 
high-cost support is capped at current per-subscriber levels, adequate support would 
be impossible, however. So, it is important that there be no caps on bids if multiple 
COLRs are to be awarded. 

Single COLRs does lead to reduced USF costs in one way—it eliminates the prob-
lem  of  multiple  supported  services  (wireline  and  wireless)  without  the  administra-
tive problems that accompany proposals to limit individual support to a single serv-
ice (to households, or locations, etc.). 

Sorana  (1998b)  examines  an  auction  mechanism  (based  on  the  3rd  lowest  bid) 
that  permits  multiple  COLRs.  He  points  out  that  ‘‘there  could  be  much  higher  cost 
involved if the auction rules are not carefully crafted.’’ This results from the vulner-
ability to collusion. While careful auction rules can avoid this (by making the num-
ber  of  COLRs  dependent  on  the  bid  amount)  ‘‘it  may  still  be  unable  to  generate 
enough incentives for high-quality service.’’ 

Laffont and Tirole (2000) provide an extended theoretical analysis of reverse auc-

tions, focused principally on the issue of multiple COLRs. They conclude: 

‘‘We are unaware of formal analyses of Universal Service auctions with endoge-
nous  market  structure.  We  have  tried  to  provide  a  framework  within  which 
analysis of such auctions can begin. The first insights thus gleaned do not build 
as strong a case for the introduction of competition as we had expected.’’ 7 

One  salient  point  is  that  endogenous  market  structure  increases  uncertainty  for 
bidders,  thereby  requiring  an  extra  risk  premium  in  their  bids.  Laffont  and  Tiorle 
also echo the complexities raised by existing infrastructure in high-cost areas, 

‘‘Much  of  the  discussion  on  Universal  Service  auctions  proceeds  as  if  all  com-
petitors  were  building  their  network  from  scratch.  This  may  be  a  fine  assump-
tion  for  newly  settled  areas  or  when  substantial  network  upgradings  are  con-
templated.  In  practice,  however,  many  high-cost  areas  are  already  partly  cov-
ered by a wire-based incumbent operator able to provide the supported services 
with its existing technology. While the incumbent operator’s network may have 
been  very  costly  to  build,  once  in  place  it  has  a  low  (short-term)  marginal  cost. 
And so facilities-based entrants (e.g., offering wireless services) may find it hard 
to  compete  with  the  incumbent.  In  our  view,  more  attention  should  be  devoted 
to this aspect of Universal Service provision.’’ 8 

In the U.S. environment, the issue is doubly complex since there is existing wire-
less infrastructure in many high-cost areas. The theoretical performance of auctions 

merits  of  the  legal  dispute,  problems  like  this  are  likely  to  accompany  bids  that  require  use  of 
other carrier’s facilities in order to satisfy the COLR obligations.

has  not  yet  been  studied  under  these  circumstances.  Nor  is  there  much  empirical 
evidence to provide guidance. 
Duration 

There  is  a  tradeoff  between  long  and  short  duration  of  COLR  franchises.  Short 
time  periods  enhance  the  ability  of  Universal  Service  costs  to  adjust  to  changes  in 
technology or changes in service definition. However, this comes at the cost of inhib-
iting investments that have longer time horizons. 

It  is  notable  that  cable  franchise  awards  (where  competitive  bidding  is  used)  are 
quite  long—typically  8–15  years.  It  is  difficult  to  reject  a  renewal  application  upon 
expiration. Federal law places the burden of proof for failing to renew a cable fran-
chise  on  the  community—they  must  show  that  the  carrier  is  either  unable  to  con-
tinue providing the service or will be unable to provide the service that the commu-
nity requires in the future [Kramer (2003)]. In fact, in the 1980s, only 7 out of 3,516 
cable refranchising decisions resulted in replacement of the existing franchise owner 
[Zupan (1989)]. 

There  is  a  relationship  between  contract  duration  and  the  number  of  winners. 
Even  with  single  auction  winners,  issues  arise  concerning  whether  the  incumbent 
winners should have any special treatment in subsequent auctions, or whether there 
are  benefits  to  opening  future  auctions  to  carriers  other  than  the  prior  winners. 
Laffont and Tirole (2000, page 261) reach the conclusion that, 

‘‘the incumbent may be shut out of the market. The transfer of the incumbent’s 
capital  to  winning  entrants  (either  through  rentals  or  through  an  acquisition) 
may  give  rise  to  the  usual  concerns  about  the  impact  of  ‘‘second  sourcing’’  on 
the incumbent’s incentives to invest in the quality of its network.’’ 

Previous  work  by  Laffont  and  Tirole  (1988)  explored  the  case  where  incumbent’s 
investments are observable (i.e., where they can be acquired by others—an example 
of  unobservable  investment  is  the  buildup  of  knowledge  within  the  human  capital 
of  the  firm’s  managers:  it  seems  that  most  rural  incumbent  investment  is  observ-
able, such as the physical capital of the infrastructure). They reach ‘‘a relatively pes-
simistic assessment of the virtues of second-sourcing (or takeover) when substantial 
investments  are  at  stake.’’  (page  532)  This  is  due  to  the  potential  that  some  of  the 
value of the incumbent’s investment may flow to future auction winners. This exter-
nality  causes  the  incumbent  to  under-invest,  and  calls  for  future  auctions  to  be 
stacked  in  the  incumbent’s  favor.  Indeed,  this  is  a  rationale  behind  the  burden  of 
proof  in  cable  refranchising  that  falls  on  those  that  do  not  want  a  franchise  re-
newed. 

Universal  Service  minimum  subsidy  auctions  in  South  America  have  typically 
used lump-sum payments with 5 year exclusive franchises [ITU (2002)]. The subsidy 
is  paid  in  stages,  according  to  established  milestones  (e.g.,  upon  installation  of  half 
of  the  required  payphones),  but  it  is  not  a  recurring  payment.  That  is,  the  subsidy 
is  geared  to  recover  the  full  cost  of  the  investment  (unless  the  bidder  is  willing  to 
bid  for  only  partial  recovery  during  the  5  year  period).  Carriers  can  decide  how 
much risk they wish to bear by bidding for less than full recovery during the 5 year 
period. Given that these South American auctions (and new ones proposed in Africa) 
take  place  in  green-field  environments,  there  is  often  a  business  case  for  ultimate 
expansion  into  these  unserved  areas,  so  bidders  may  be  willing  to  accept  less  than 
full cost recovery from the subsidy mechanism. It is unclear how relevant these cir-
cumstances  are  to  the  U.S.  rural  environment  (where  many  rural  areas  are  not 
growing). 

Sorana (1998) points out that ‘‘sufficiency’’ of USF is not assured by good auction 
design,  and  neither  is  voluntary  provision  of  universal  service.  He  constructs  a 
model  to  compare  reverse  auctions  with  cost-proxy  models,  finding  that  auctions 
may involve lower subsidies than accurate cost proxy models, but his model assumes 
that  the  funds  from  the  auction  are  sufficient  for  the  intended  purposes.  He  notes 
that this is not assured. 

Competitive  bidding  is  used  in  the  Essential  Air  Service  program,  but  with  only 
a  2  year  horizon.  Airplanes,  however,  are  quite  mobile,  unlike  telecommunications 
infrastructure.  These  examples  suggest  that  the  time  periods  would  have  to  be  rel-
atively long, if there is to be sufficient incentive to invest in telecommunications in-
frastructure. 
Transition 

Existing  infrastructure  complicates  the  picture.  Suppose  the  incumbent  loses  the 
auction but has investment that was prudently incurred, but has not yet been fully 
recovered.  It  is  possible  that  the  winning  bidder  may  want  to  purchase  this  infra-

structure.9 This  creates  legal  and  policy  issues,  but  it  also  impacts  economic  effi-
ciency.  If  regulators  establish  a  precedent  for  truncating  recovery  of  prudent  past 
investments,  then  future  investment  will  be  affected.  It  is  unlikely  many  invest-
ments will take place with payoff periods longer than the duration of the franchise. 
The  World  Bank  (2000,  pages  6–26)  cites  competitive  bidding  as  a  feature  of  a 
good  universality  fund,  but  ‘‘As  previously  discussed,  the  process  is  more  difficult 
where  an  incumbent  is  already  providing  the  designated  universal  services.’’  The 
embedded  network  may  provide  the  incumbent  with  an  advantage  bidding  against 
new entrants (as was the case in India and Australia, discussed below), or may force 
the  incumbent  to  fail  to  recover  its  past  investments,  despite  regulatory  oversight 
deeming those investments to be prudent. 

Despite  these  complications,  the  World  Bank  does  claim  that  auctions  are  still 
possible—they cite transfer of assets to the lowest bidder, subcontracting, joint ven-
tures,  etc.  as  mechanisms  that  can  deal  with  embedded  infrastructure.  While  such 
developments  can  enhance  efficiency,  there  are  costs  associated  with  each  of  these 
avenues (as demonstrated in the Hawaii case in footnote 6). 

The  only  way  to  avoid  bias  either  for  or  against  incumbent  networks  is  to  fully 
recover  the  incumbent’s  investment  prior  to  enacting  the  reverse  auction.  It  is  not 
surprising  that  the  most  successful  reverse  auctions  (Chile,  Peru,  Guatemala,  Co-
lumbia,  and  the  Dominican  Republic)  involved  previously  unserved  areas  or  signifi-
cant upgrades to the existing infrastructure within these areas [ITU (2004)]. 

The  need  to  address  stranded  investment  is  well-recognized  in  the  area  of  elec-
tricity  deregulation.  The  Congressional  Budget  Office  (1998)  reviewed  the  stranded 
cost issue, concluding, 

‘‘For  reasons  of  fairness  and  political  reality,  utilities  are  likely  to  be  com-
pensated  for  some  or  all  of  their  losses.  Determining  the  correct  figure  for 
stranded costs, deciding how much of them to compensate, and figuring out how 
that  compensation  should  be  paid  are  difficult  issues,  which  are  slowing 
progress toward restructuring in many states.’’ 

Volumes have been written and disputes continue over measurement and recovery 
of  stranded  electric  generating  costs,  but  it  is  an  issue  faced  by  all  attempts  at  de-
regulation. 

For example, in Texas, there is a provision for ‘‘true-up’’ charges: 

‘‘These  ‘true-up’  proceedings  are  designed  to  provide  commission  authorization 
for an electric utility to begin recovery of its costs for power plants built to meet 
customer  demand  for  electricity  prior  to  the  start  of  retail  competition,  which 
cannot  be  recovered  in  the  competitive  marketplace.  These  costs  are  said  to  be 
‘stranded.’ ’’10 

Reverse auctions potentially render the incumbent’s network less valuable (if they 
lose  the  bid  or  forego  full  cost  recovery  in  order  to  win  the  bid).  Given  that  these 
were  prudent  investments  undertaken  precisely  to  fulfill  the  COLR,  there  is  a 
strong case for recovery of these stranded costs. To the extent that new technologies 
(e.g.,  wireless)  cause  this  decrease  in  value,  the  case  for  recovery  is  strengthened 
(since  the  investments  were  prudent  at  the  time  they  were  made,  and  were  often 
recovered  through  overly  long  depreciation  schedules).  Resolution  of  this  issue  is  of 
political,  legal,  and  economic  importance  (the  latter  through  its  affect  on  future  in-
vestment incentives). 
Eligibility 

Bidders must be financially and operationally capable of fulfilling their COLR re-
sponsibilities. The FCC has considerable experience with ensuring bidder eligibility, 
although there have been problems, particularly with small bidders. The goal should 
be  to  have  enough  bidders  to  ensure  a  competitive  bidding  process,  while  limiting 
future problems with failure to deliver the required services. 

The 1999 Peru auctions illustrate this problem [ITU (2004)]. The winning bid was 
20  percent  of  the  available  subsidy,  but  the  winning  company  then  could  not  meet 
its targets. The ITU presents this an example of excessively low bidding and points 
out  that  most  Latin  American  auctions  have  attracted  bidders  without  much  oper-
ational experience, and have failed to attract large international operators or incum-
bents. 

9 Although  this  may  entail  problems  such  as  those  encountered  in  the  Hawaii  case  discussed 

above.

Summary on Geography, Size, Numbers, and Eligibility 

66 

The  discussion  thus  far  can  be  summarized  as  a  spectrum  of  choices  that  would 
govern  the  intensity  of  competition  for  the  COLR  subsidy.  International  experience 
can  be  placed  on  a  continuum  from  lack  of  competition  to  healthy  competition.  The 
Latin  American  examples  [World  Bank  (2000),  ITU  (2002),  ITU  (2004),  Intelecon 
(2005), Scherf (2006)] appear to have had truly competitive bidding in their reverse 
auctions.  Savings  of  50  percent  (compared  with  the  maximum  potential  subsidy 
level)  are  commonly  cited,  but  these  ‘‘savings’’  are  based  on  comparison  with  a  cost 
proxy model of unknown accuracy. There is no evidence concerning the relative costs 
of  reverse  auctions  and  other  Universal  Service  mechanisms  in  any  of  these  coun-
tries. Still, the auctions were administratively feasible and resulted in multiple bid-
ders for the COLR. 

The  extreme  example  of  a  lack  of  competition  for  the  market  is  India  [Malik  and 
Silva  (2005),  Noll  and  Wallsten  (2005)].  Reverse  auctions  were  held  for  infrastruc-
ture  upgrades  to  a  number  of  rural  areas.  The  incumbent,  BSNL,  won  almost  all 
of  the  bids  and  bid  the  maximum  subsidy  available  in  each  case.  Critics  of  the  In-
dian  auction  point  out  that  the  eligibility  rules  essentially  predetermined  this  out-
come.  Only  providers  with  current  infrastructure  in  these  regions  could  bid;  tech-
nologies  were  limited  to  wireline  and  fixed  wireless,  and  bidders  were  required  to 
install infrastructure to reach everyone within these regions but without any whole-
sale  regulation  of  the  incumbent  to  provide  for  interconnection,  unbundling,  or  re-
sale.  As  a  result,  in  19  of  the  20  areas,  there  was  only  a  single  bidder  (BSNL)  and 
they  bid  the  maximum  subsidy  available.  The  rules  were  designed  to  promote  nei-
ther entry nor efficiency. 

The  other  end  of  the  spectrum  can  be  envisioned  as  the  U.S.  While  competitive 
bidding has not been utilized, support on a predetermined per line basis (i.e., with-
out  uniform  coverage  requirements)  has  been  offered  to  multiple  ETCs.  The  fact 
that many rural areas have witnessed multiple carriers willing to accept the offered 
support level, suggests that there would be multiple bidders if the auction were con-
ducted  on  a  per-line  subsidy  level,  and  without  requirements  to  serve  everybody 
within  the  same  service  areas  with  the  same  quality  characteristics.  In  this  sense, 
the current rules for the high-cost fund are designed to promote entry, but not effi-
ciency.11 

Australia provides an interesting data point [Department of Communications, In-
formation Technology and the Arts, Australia (2004), ITU (2006)]. Two pilot regions 
were  selected  for  reverse  auctions.  These  included  the  most  remote  80  percent  of 
Australia,  and  $150  million  was  available  for  introducing  unlimited  local  calling 
with  these  areas.  The  goal  was  to  find  ‘‘a  simpler  way  of  determining  a  reasonable 
level  of  subsidy  de-linked  from  a  calculation  of  costs.’’ 12 The  auction  was  designed 
for  a  single  winner.  No  competitive  tenders  were  received.  In  fact,  since  1991,  car-
riers  other  than  the  incumbent  (Telstra)  have  been  free  to  apply  to  be  COLR,  but 
none have applied. The ITU report concluded ‘‘However, while the experiences with 
designating  Universal  Service  providers  on  the  basis  of  competitive  tendering  in 
some  countries  has  been  encouraging  (e.g.,  Chile  and  Peru),  there  has  been  some 
less positive experience in Australia.’’ 

Australian  regulators  did  follow-up  analysis  to  determine  the  causes  for  lack  of 
competitive  interest.  Major  factors  cited  were:  difficulty  competing  with  Telstra, 
meeting  the  obligation  to  serve  all  customers,  and  difficulty  identifying  other  rev-
enue opportunities to help support COLR responsibilities. It is also possible that the 
investment  climate  at  the  time  of  the  pilots  was  unfavorable.  The  regulator  con-
cluded  that  higher  subsidies  might  induce  entry,  but  they  were  not  worth  the  sig-
nificant increase in costs. They recommended preserving the reverse auction option, 
but not continuing it at this time. One benefit they cite from the pilots is the deter-
mination  that  Telstra  was  not  being  overcompensated  for  COLR  at  current  subsidy 
levels. 

Another  example  is  provided  by  electricity  deregulation  in  Maine  [Maine  Public 
Utilities  Commission  (2002)].  Maine  claims  to  have  the  most  robust  retail  competi-
tion for electricity customers in the Nation. Significant competition (more than half 
of the market) has developed for large customers. Virtually no retail competition has 
developed for small residential and business customers (with the single of exception 

11 Parties  differ  in  the  source  of  inefficiency  that  they  see,  but  virtually  all  agree  it  is  ineffi-
cient. Some parties point to the support of multiple carriers based on incumbent costs as leading 
to unnecessary duplication of infrastructure and unnecessary support for CETCs. Others believe 
the  waste  is  caused  by  the  cost  plus  nature  of  determining  support  levels.  In  any  case,  nobody 
claims the current environment is particularly efficient.

of  a  small  area  in  northern  Maine,  which  the  Commission  discounts  for  a  number 
of region-specific reasons). 

State  legislation  eliminated  the  obligation  to  serve,  with  ‘‘standard  offer  service’’ 
available for those who could not find a suitable competitive supplier. The Commis-
sion  was  instructed  to  strive  for  at  least  3  suppliers  of  standard  offer  service  in 
every areas, ‘‘but only if multiple suppliers would not cause rates to be significantly 
higher.’’ 

Early attempts to solicit competitive bids for standard offer service did not result 
in retail suppliers for all customer classes. Later attempts were somewhat more suc-
cessful. Still, the Commission notes that ‘‘there is virtually no retail competition for 
residential  and  small  commercial  customers,  either  in  Maine  or  elsewhere.’’  Their 
research concludes that prices should not be increased in the hope of attracting sup-
pliers (consumer input was strongly against paying higher prices in exchange for in-
creased competition). Standard offer service does extend some of the benefits of com-
petition to individual small customers through the aggregation inherent in a stand-
ard  offer  available  throughout  the  state.  In  the  telecommunications  context,  this  is 
akin to requiring geographical averaging of retail prices across broad geographic re-
gions.  This  is  closer  to  the  old  system  of  implicit  support  in  which  lower  cost  cus-
tomers  pay  higher  prices  in  order  to  support  lower  prices  for  the  high-cost  cus-
tomers. Such a system is not feasible in a truly competitive environment. 

What  these  examples  reveal  is  that  regulators  have  wide  discretion  in  deter-
mining the extent of competition for the market that results from a reverse auction. 
They can design auctions that preclude entry (such as in India) or they can promote 
entry,  regardless  of  attendant  inefficiencies  (the  U.S.).  It  appears  to  be  feasible  to 
get  reasonable  entry  and  efficiency  in  a  green-field  environment.  This  is  what  the 
Latin  American  examples  show.  It  is  more  elusive  in  environments  with  existing 
providers. 

The political economy of regulatory policy must be considered when evaluating re-
verse auctions. In the absence of strong policy direction, it will be difficult to design 
a  reverse  auction  that  does  not  either  deny  CETCs  their  current  support  or  deny 
rural ILECs recovery of their existing investments. The result could well be a man-
aged  competitive  reverse  auction,  with  few  of  the  benefits  that  reverse  auctions  po-
tentially offer. 

To  avoid  a  managed  outcome,  regulators  must  set  a  clear  goal  in  terms  of  how 
much entry they want, and what efficiency cost they are willing to bear. A concrete 
example  is  the  choice  of  serving  area.  Very  small  geographical  areas  can  promote 
entry  (per-subscriber  subsidy  bids  is  the  extreme  example),  but  jeopardize  the  abil-
ity  to  realize  cost  complementarities  and  at  the  risk  of  unnecessary  duplication  of 
support.  The  trouble  is  that  regulators  must  know  a  great  deal  about  what  is  most 
efficient  before  they  can  design  the  reverse  auction  (for  example,  they  must  know 
how  many  COLRs  are  efficient,  and  which  technologies  are  most  efficient,  and  how 
to  define  Universal  Service  over  the  length  of  the  franchise  contract).  It  is  the  ab-
sence  of  such  knowledge  that  is  one  of  the  major  benefits  of  using  reverse  auctions 
to begin with—the market is supposed to provide these answers. 

It  is  the  existence  of  current  infrastructures  that  complicates  this  design.  Rules 
cannot be chosen that will satisfy all interests, so the regulator is required to know 
what the efficient outcome looks like before the auction can be designed. In a green- 
field  environment,  by  definition  the  COLR  that  is  being  auctioned  is  one  that  the 
market  has  not  found  profitable—hence,  there  are  fewer  interests  at  stake  in  the 
creation  of  the  reverse  auction  mechanism.  The  evidence  supports  this  conclusion: 
green-field reverse auctions have been fairly successful, while there are no clear ex-
amples of competitive bidding in more developed settings. 
Auction Mechanics 

There  are  a  number  of  subsidiary  design  questions  that  deal  with  the  mechanics 

of how a reverse auction would actually operate. 
Type of Bidding 

Most  reverse  auctions  have  utilized  simple  one-shot  sealed  auctions.  Most  spec-
trum auction design has been multiple-round, open, combinatorial auctions. The un-
derlying issues concern the importance of cost/value complementarities, bidder risks, 
and  opportunities  for  collusion.  These  have  been  extensively  studied  in  the  general 
auction literature. A few particular considerations apply in a Universal Service set-
ting.  Cost  complementarities  are  potentially  important,  so  the  auction  must  either 
be  combinatorial  or  involve  fairly  large  geographical  areas.  Both  pose  problems.  In 
addition,  in  an  environment  in  which  there  are  existing  infrastructure  providers, 
sealed bidding would appear to impede much necessary negotiation about joint bids, 
outsourcing arrangements, etc. Some research suggests that sealed bidding may ac-

68 

tually facilitate collusion [Luander and Nilsson (2004)]. On balance, it would appear 
that combinatorial bidding is more appropriate in the U.S. environment, but the fea-
sibility and complexity of the required auction is in some dispute. 
Determination of Winner(s) 

It  is  clear  that  more  than  price  must  be  considered  in  determining  winning  bids. 
None of the international examples (or domestic examples from other industries) en-
tail  a  price-only  selection.  What  the  literature  does  say,  however,  is  that  the  rules 
for  determining  winners  must  be  specified  precisely  and  unambiguously  in  advance 
[ITU  (2002),  World  Bank  (2000)].  That  is,  the  process  must  avoid  subjectivity.  This 
is  the  same  problem  encountered  in  many  procurement  contracts—the  rules  must 
be clear and objective. 

Current costs, under the U.S. high-cost fund, are controlled via a number of over-
sight  mechanisms,  the  lack  of  full  cost  recovery  (high-cost  funding  only  supports  a 
percentage  of  the  costs  above  the  national  average),  and  competitive  pressure  from 
other  services  (e.g.,  VoIP,  wireless  usage  substituting  for  wireline  usage,  etc.).  The 
high-cost fund, itself, is not designed to necessarily minimize costs. It does not con-
tain  cost-reducing  incentives  as  strong  as  would  an  auction  mechanism.  While  this 
can  lead  to  inefficiency  in  terms  of  costs,  it  also  permits  more  flexibility  in  terms 
of  services  offered  (e.g.,  broadband  speeds).  This  flexibility  has  value—particularly, 
if  regulators  do  not  have  sufficient  information  to  project  Universal  Service  defini-
tions into the future. 
Post-Award Flexibility 

Reverse  auctions  in  developing  countries  have  relied  on  additional  service  reve-
nues  to  reduce  the  cost  of  public  subsidies.  Permitting  COLRs  to  market  value- 
added  services,  in  addition  to  the  contracted  COLR,  can  result  in  their  bids  being 
less  than  the  cost  of  providing  solely  the  COLR.  Some  countries  have  specifically 
permitted  retail  prices  in  rural  areas  to  exceed  those  in  urban  areas  by  predeter-
mined amounts. In some auctions (e.g., the Essential Air Service Program) there are 
no restrictions on post-award pricing at all. 

It is clear that bidders will bid lower in a reverse auction to the degree that they 
have  post-award  flexibility.  However,  flexibility  endangers  the  concept  of  universal 
service.  Once  again,  there  is  a  tradeoff.  The  more  flexibility  that  is  provided,  the 
lower the expected subsidy required, but the less assurance there is that Universal 
Service objectives will be met. 

It is also worth noting that the ‘‘successful’’ Latin American reverse auctions rely, 
in part, on asymmetric interconnection fees to support rural providers. For example, 
the  largest  Chilean  rural  operator  gets  60  percent  of  its  total  revenues  from  such 
charges; Columbia has recently introduced asymmetric fees, and Peru plans to [ITU 
(2004)].  They  also  permit  higher  rural  prices  and  lower  license  fees  in  rural  areas. 
Uganda  has  recently  introduced  a  reverse  auction  for  service  to  154  communities 
that  no  operators  were  willing  to  serve,  and  part  of  the  mechanism  was  permitting 
voice  service  rates  in  rural  areas  to  be  up  to  50  percent  above  rates  in  Kampala 
(as well as higher termination fees in rural areas) [Intelecon (2005)]. 
Monitoring and Enforcement 

Performance  under  the  franchise  award  must  be  monitored.  Most  countries  have 
specific  penalties  for  failure  of  winning  bidders  to  meet  their  performance  targets. 
Removal of a COLR, either through failure to perform adequately or through carrier 
bankruptcy,  poses  particular  problems  for  reverse  auctions  for  universal  service. 
How is service to be guaranteed for rural customers in the event that their winning 
bidder  does  not  (or  is  unable  to)  meet  its  obligations?  Scherf  (2006)  cites  this  as  a 
weakness  in  the  build-out  requirements  that  accompany  licenses  in  many  devel-
oping countries: it is cheaper to pay the penalties than fulfill the requirements. 

Bankruptcy  risks  are  somewhat  mitigated  under  the  current  USF  by  the  historic 
regulatory  compact  in  which  rural  ILECs  have  been  able  to  recover  their  past  in-
vestments. When cost recovery becomes more uncertain, and when awards are based 
on low subsidy bids, these risks increase. 

Scherf  (2006)  says  that  ‘‘the  regulatory  environment  has  to  be  credible  and  sus-
tainable to the eyes of investors,’’ (page 12) and discusses issues associated with en-
forcement  mechanisms,  particularly  in  developing  countries.  He  cites  problems  in 
Peru, where some very low bids had been submitted, with subsequent renegotiation 
under  the  threat  of  carrier  bankruptcy.  He  also  mentions  Uganda,  where  the  regu-
lator has not even asked for the performance data it would need to monitor perform-
ance. These concerns are more pronounced in countries with less developed political 
institutions,  but  they  also  arise  in  the  U.S.  In  addition,  we  have  the  issue  of  the 
appropriate jurisdictional responsibility for monitoring and enforcement.

Conclusions 

In a definitive work on the theory and practice of auctions, Klemperer (2004) con-

cludes, 

‘‘In  conclusion,  the  most  important  features  of  an  auction  are  its  robustness 
against  collusion  and  its  attractiveness  to  potential  bidders.  Failure  to  attend 
to  these  issues  can  lead  to  disaster.  And  anyone  setting  up  an  auction  would 
be  foolish  to  blindly  follow  past  successful  designs:  auction  design  is  not  ‘one 
size fits all.’ . . . In the practical design of auctions, local circumstances matter 
and the devil is in the details.’’ 13 

Auctions have a number of desirable properties. The ITU states that, 

‘‘The  use  of  well-designed  competitive  tenders  can  (in  certain  circumstances) 
help  to  generate  incentives  to  contain  costs,  innovate,  and  reveal  the  true  cost 
of  delivering  Universal  Service  (thus  helping  to  minimize  the  subsidy  re-
quired.’’ 14 

We have seen that auctions can be feasible and effective for provision of Universal 
Service  in  unserved  areas,  if  they  are  properly  designed.  Their  success  depends  on 
an  appropriate  definition  of  the  objective  for  universal  service.  Reverse  auctions 
have  been  most  successful  where  the  objective  can  be  clearly  defined  and  does  not 
require  long-range  forecasting:  e.g.,  provide  payphone  service  in  specified  rural  vil-
lages (Chile, Peru, Columbia, Guatemala). 

Reverse  auctions  in  the  U.S.  are  a  different  matter.  There  are  multiple  existing 
infrastructures,  utilizing  different  technologies,  providing  different  services,  and 
with different serving areas. Universal Service is an evolving set of service require-
ments  that  is  difficult  to  forecast.  The  performance  of  auctions  in  this  setting  is 
theoretically and empirically untested. The limited evidence suggests that these are 
difficult problems. 

Auction  design  will  need  to  address  competition  within  the  market  as  well  as  for 
the market, potentially large cost complementarities between high-cost areas as well 
as between high-cost and low-cost areas, and provide for investment incentives with 
significant sunk costs and technological uncertainty. 

Much  of  the  theoretical  appeal  of  reverse  auctions  is  dissipated  under  the  actual 
conditions  under  which  Universal  Service  will  be  provided.  Regulators  will  need 
more foresight than they would like. They will need to specify Universal Service re-
quirements  far  enough  into  the  future  to  allow  for  the  required  investment  incen-
tives. They will need to know more about the most efficient market structure (single 
COLR, multiple, which technology, etc.) than they would like. Auctions are supposed 
to permit the market to make these determinations, not regulators. But, this benefit 
can be illusive. Can the market pick the technology if the auction design cannot put 
different technological platforms on an equal footing? 

One  clear  beneficiary  of  a  reverse  auction  system  is  the  economics  profession. 
Their expertise lies in auction design and the devilish details contain plenty of inter-
esting  work.  How  consumers  of  Universal  Service  and  providers  will  fare,  is  less 
clear. 
The Joint Board Discussion Proposal 

The Discussion Proposal (The Proposal) provided with the Joint Board Public No-
tice  provides  a  good  illustration  of  the  difficulties  of  applying  reverse  auctions  in  a 
nongreenfield  environment.  The  Proposal  does  not  appear  to  be  derived  from  any 
theoretical  efficiency  properties,  nor  does  it  follow  the  reverse  auctions  that  have 
been  implemented  elsewhere.  Instead,  it  seems  to  be  driven  by  the  need  to  accom-
modate  the  fact  that  we  are  currently  supporting  multiple  networks  using  multiple 
technologies in rural areas. 

Separate  support  for  broadband  and  mobility  services  in  rural  areas  for  10  year 
periods,  takes  a  particularly  static  view  of  technology.  It  provides  support  to  two 
sets  of  services,  neither  of  which  are  included  in  the  current  definition  of  universal 
service—mobility  and  broadband.  The  Proposal  does  attempt  to  address  the  transi-
tion  issue  by  offering  an  initial  phase-in  whereby  rural  ILECs  can  elect  to  receive 
support  (at  current  levels  plus  inflation)  for  the  first  10  year  period  for  broadband 
service. This is recognition that past prudently incurred investments need to be re-
covered. 

But,  what  happens  after  10  years?  What  will  govern  future  network  investment? 
Here, the Proposal is silent on the details that will ultimately determine future Uni-
versal Service in rural America. The Proposal says that ETCs would be required to

relinquish essential facilities at ‘‘fair market value’’ at the end of the contract term. 
After 10 years of trying to determine ‘‘fair market value’’ for unbundled network ele-
ments under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the task of determining ‘‘fair mar-
ket value’’ for essential rural network facilities will be daunting. 

The  Proposal  defines  geographical  coverage  as  90  percent  or  more  of  the  house-
holds, without specifying how ETCs would acquire the services needed to reach the 
remainder  of  the  households  (echoing  some  of  the  problems  in  the  Australian  and 
Indian  reverse  auctions  discussed  above).  Basic  geographical  units  would  be  coun-
ties,  with  the  exception  of  rural  ILECs,  and  counties  could  be  bid  on  in  bundles  or 
separately.  This  does  not  address  the  complexity  of  the  combinatorial  auction  that 
would be required (the U.S. Census Bureau lists 3,141 counties or county-equivalent 
administrative units), nor does it address the issue of whether the mobility support 
would  extend  to  all  counties,  including  those  served  by  nonrural  ILECs.  There  is 
the  potential  for  a  significant  growth  in  the  fund,  if  it  includes  currently  unsup-
ported areas. 

Upon review of the past ‘‘successes’’ with reverse auctions, they appear to deliver 
tangible benefits when used to support delivery of services where current infrastruc-
ture is not in place. While many rural areas see significant competition among wire-
less carriers, there is still a need for more extensive build-out of rural networks. The 
mobility USF could be aimed at this goal, by tying support to specific infrastructure 
targets. 

The  Proposal  illustrates  the  complexity  of  applying  reverse  auctions  in  the  exist-
ing mixed technology infrastructure of the United States. The devil is in the details, 
but the details are not in the Proposal.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Crothers. 
May I now recognize Dr. Staihr? 

STATEMENT OF BRIAN K. STAIHR, PH.D., REGULATORY 

ECONOMIST, EMBARQTM CORPORATION 

Dr. STAIHR. Thank you very much. 
I’m  Brian  Staihr.  I’m  an  Economist  for  Embarq.  Very  happy  to 

be here today. 

Now,  Embarq  is  the  country’s  largest  independent  wireline  tele-
phone  company.  We  have  about  7  million  customers  across  18 
states. And if you look at the picture that Brian’s showing you over 
here we serve some very wonderful rural areas, like Possum King-
dom, Texas, and Pretty Prairie, Kansas. 

[Laughter.] 
Dr. STAIHR. And because we’re very rural, we appreciate the time 
and  the  effort  that  this  committee  has  put  into  the  subject  of  Uni-
versal  Service.  Already  this  year,  Senator  Stevens  has  introduced 
the USA Act, which addresses many important issues. And we look 
forward to working with all of you in the future. 

Now, quickly to reiterate two facts, we all know that the Federal 
Fund  has  grown  significantly  in  the  past  few  years  and  the  FCC 
is  looking  at  ways  to  control  this  growth,  including  auctions.  We 
also  know,  if  you  look  at  this  graph,  that  the  source  of  the  growth 
is receipts that have gone to competitive carriers rather than to in-
cumbents  that  serve  as  carriers  of  last  resort.  Now,  this  difference 
is  significant,  because  when  a  company  is  a  carrier  of  last  resort, 
it has an obligation to serve all the customers in an area, including 
the  high-cost  customers  that  nobody  else  wants  to  serve.  Competi-
tive  carriers  and  wireless  carriers  don’t  have  this  obligation  even 
when they get USF.

72 

Now, to see why this difference is significant, I want to show you 
a  picture  of  Meadowview,  Virginia.  The  different  colors  in  the  pic-
ture on the left represent different population densities. Yellow and 
red show high density, which is low cost. The green shows low den-
sity,  which  is  high  cost.  Embarq,  as  the  carrier  of  last  resort,  has 
to serve the whole thing, the yellow and the green parts. 

The  second  picture  shows  you  the  wireless  coverage 

in 
Meadowview.  As  you  can  see,  the  wireless  coverage  pretty  much 
stops  where  the  high-cost  parts  start.  The  wireless  carrier  doesn’t 
have  an  obligation  to  serve  the  high-cost  area;  and,  even  if  it  re-
ceives USF, it doesn’t have this obligation. 

Now,  this  picture  illustrates  a  key  problem  with  the  Fund  as  it 
exists  today.  Before  we  had  competition,  a  company  like  Embarq 
would serve Meadowview, and we could count on the low-cost areas 
offsetting  the  high-cost  areas.  If  we  lost  money  serving  the  green 
part, that was OK, because we served the yellow part, too, and, on 
average,  we  were  all  right.  But,  after  1996,  competition  developed, 
and,  in  a  place  like  Meadowview,  it  developed  just  in  the  yellow 
areas. As a result, we could no longer count on that low-cost offset-
ting the high cost, because we’d lost half the customers in the low- 
cost area. 

The  point  here  is,  the  Federal  Universal  Service  Fund  has  not 
kept  pace  with  this  competitive  reality,  because,  when  the  current 
system  looks  at  a  place  like  Meadowview,  it  assumes  that  Embarq 
can  continue  to  use  the  low-cost  areas  to  offset  the  high  cost,  and 
we can’t do that anymore. 

In addition, under the current system, this competition creates a 
very strange kind of chain reaction. Competitors come into the low- 
cost  areas,  they  get  the  same  support  per  line  as  the  incumbent. 
This  support  draws  more  competitors  into  those  same  areas.  That 
means  the  competitors  serve  low-cost  customers,  the  incumbent 
serves  high-cost  customers,  the  incumbent’s  costs  go  up,  the  sup-
port  goes  up,  we  end  up  oversupporting  the  town  center  and  basi-
cally shortchanging the outlying areas. 

The way to fix this is to target support more granularly, to reex-
amine  the  area  that  we  look  at  when  we  determine  the  need  for 
Universal Service support, particularly to consider the town center 
and the outlying areas differently. 

What  will  this  do?  Three  things.  First,  it’ll  stop  that  chain  reac-
tion.  Second,  it’ll  target  the  support  to  where  it’s  really  needed. 
And,  third,  it  will  eliminate  this  reliance  on  these  unsustainable 
cross-subsidies,  while  not  necessarily  increasing  the  size  of  the 
Fund. 

Now, I’ve got one more picture to show you. This is Fort Meade, 
Florida. Every green dot on that picture is a customer location. You 
can  see  there’s  a  very  clear  downtown  area.  That  area  is  pretty 
low-cost.  The  outlying  areas  are  much  higher-cost.  All  right?  The 
outlying areas don’t see competition, in general. When we see com-
petition  in  Fort  Meade,  it’s,  just  like  Meadowview,  in  that  down-
town  area.  As  a  result,  the  outlying  areas  can’t  be  subsidized  by 
the  downtown.  The  outlying  areas  need  support.  And,  under  the 
current system, they don’t get any. 

Targeting  USF  would  bring  rationality  to  the  USF  distribution 
system.  And  it’s  not  mutually  exclusive  with  other  policy  consider-

ations  that  we’re  looking  at  today.  We  can  talk  about  reverse  auc-
tions. We can talk about support for broadband. We can talk about 
eliminating  identical  support.  We  can  talk  about  more  granular 
support,  in  conjunction  with  any  of  those.  Or  we  can  talk  about 
more  targeted  support,  apart  from  any  of  those.  It  works  both 
ways. 

Now,  to  wrap  things  up,  11  years  ago  when  the  Act  was  passed, 
we  didn’t  have  much  competition  in  rural  America,  we  didn’t  have 
the  capabilities  or  the  tools  to  calculate  support  specifically  for 
these  outlying  areas.  Today,  we  have  the  capability,  we  have  the 
tools,  and  we  have  one  more  thing—we  have  the  incentive,  going 
forward, to do it right. 

So,  with  that,  I’ll  stop.  I  appreciate  the  time  today  and  look  for-

ward to any questions you may have. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Staihr follows:] 
PREPARED STATEMENT OF BRIAN K. STAIHR, PH.D., REGULATORY ECONOMIST, 

EMBARQTM CORPORATION 

Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Vice-Chairman Stevens, and members of the Com-
mittee. My name is Brian Staihr, I work as an economist for Embarq, and I appre-
ciate the opportunity to testify before you today. 

Embarq  is  the  largest  independent  wireline  telephone  company  in  the  country, 
serving  nearly  seven  million  customers  across  eighteen  states  [Fig.  1].  We  serve 
some of the most rural portions of the country, places like Possum Kingdom, Texas; 
Pretty Prairie, Kansas; and Crater Lake, Oregon. And because we serve rural Amer-
ica, we are well aware that this Committee has put tremendous time and effort into 
the  subject  of  universal  service.  Already  this  year,  Senator  Stevens  has  introduced 
the  USA  Act  which  addresses  a  number  of  important  issues  such  as  exempting  the 
Universal  Service  Fund  (USF)  from  the  Antideficiency  Act  and  stabilizing  the  con-
tribution  base  while  preserving  State  Universal  Service  programs.  We  look  forward 
to  working  with  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens  and  all  the  members  of 
this  Committee  going  forward  as  you  sort  through  the  complex  issues  involved  in 
laying a solid foundation for the next generation of universal service. Getting these 
issues right is a matter of vital importance not just to the stakeholders around this 
table,  but  to  the  economic  competitiveness  of  every  rural  community—and  those  in 
more populated areas who benefit by connecting to rural America.

I  want  to  start  out  today  by  highlighting  two  established  facts:  First,  we  know 
that  the  Federal  Universal  Service  Fund  has  grown  dramatically  in  recent  years. 
As a result of this growth, the FCC is investigating various ways to control the size 
of  the  Fund,  including  the  use  of  reverse  auctions,  which  I  will  talk  more  about  in 
a moment. 

Second, as the graphs before you illustrate [Fig. 2], we also know this growth has 
been  driven  by  the  increasing  participation  of  second  and  third  competitive  carriers 
in  the  Fund,  as  opposed  to  the  incumbent  carriers  that  shoulder  the  core  carrier- 
of-last-resort responsibilities. 

This  difference  is  significant.  When  a  company  such  as  Embarq  is  a  carrier-of- 
last-resort, that company has an obligation to serve all customers, including the cus-
tomers in very high-cost areas that no one else wants to serve. Competitive carriers 
and  wireless  carriers  do  not  have  these  same  carrier-of-last-resort  obligations,  even 
when they receive USF dollars. 

To  illustrate  why  this  difference  is  significant,  I’ve  included  a  picture  here  of  a 
rural  area  that  Embarq  serves  called  Meadowview,  Virginia  [Fig.  3].  The  different 
colors  on  the  left  picture  represent  different  population  densities,  with  red  and  yel-
low  showing  the  highest  densities  and  green  showing  low  density.  As  you  can  see, 
the  southern  portion  of  Meadowview  is  actually  fairly  populous;  the  northern  part 
is  less  populous,  very  rural,  and  very  high-cost  to  serve.  Embarq,  as  the  carrier-of- 
last-resort, serves the entirety of Meadowview, the yellow parts and the green parts.

In contrast, the picture on the right shows the coverage area of the major wireless 
provider  in  Meadowview.  As  you  can  see,  wireless  coverage  essentially  stops  where 
the high-cost areas start. Strange as it may sound, the wireless company has no ob-
ligation  to  serve  the  high-cost  portions  of  Meadowview,  even  if  it  receives  USF  dol-
lars. 

These  pictures  actually  illustrate  three  related  concepts  that  lie  at  the  heart  of 

the challenges that Universal Service faces today. 

First,  before  competition,  a  company  like  Embarq  could  serve  an  area  such  as 
Meadowview  and  count  on  the  fact  that  the  lower-cost  portions  would  offset  the 
higher-cost  portions.  It  didn’t  matter  if  a  company  lost  money  serving  the  green 
areas,  because  the  company  also  served  the  yellow  areas  and,  on  average,  the  com-
pany could cover its costs. 

Second,  this  changed  with  the  passage  of  the  1996  Telecom  Act.  We  have  seen 
competition  develop  everywhere,  but  in  places  like  Meadowview  the  competition  is 
limited  to  what  we  see  here:  the  more  densely  populated  areas.  Competitors—both 
wireline and wireless—most often target the low-cost areas, and avoid the high-cost 
areas.  As  a  result,  we  can  no  longer  count  on  those  lower-cost  areas  to  offset  the 
highest-cost regions because in many cases we’ve lost half the customers in the low- 
cost areas to competition. 

Third,  and  most  importantly,  the  Federal  Universal  Service  Fund  has  not  kept 
pace  with  this  competitive  reality.  When  the  current  USF  mechanism  evaluates  an 
area  like  Meadowview,  the  system  assumes  that  Embarq  can  continue  to  use  low- 
cost  areas  to  offset  the  higher-cost  ones.  In  fact,  the  current  system  assumes  that 
Embarq  can  use  low-cost  areas  anywhere  in  the  state  of  Virginia  to  offset  the  cost 
of serving the high-cost portions of Meadowview. 

In addition, by allowing competitive carriers to receive support while serving only 
the parts of a rural study area they choose, the current system creates dysfunctional 
incentives that lead to an unfortunate chain reaction: 

• New entrants gravitate to the town center area and receive support at the same 

per-line rate as the carrier of last resort, creating a windfall opportunity; 

same geographic area; 

• Drawn  by  the  windfall,  multiple  competitive  providers  apply  for  support  in  the 
• Bereft of its low-cost, offsetting customers, the incumbent carrier’s per-line costs 
go up—increasing the support to all USF recipients in that area, and increasing 
the windfall; 
• The Fund ends up overspending in the town centers and shortchanging the out-

lying areas where support is most needed.

As  we  look  to  the  future  of  Universal  Service,  we  need  to  correct  these  basic 
misassumptions to make the Fund truly compatible with today’s—and tomorrow’s— 
competitive  environment.  The  way  to  do  that  is  straightforward:  We  have  to  re-ex-
amine the geographic area that we use to determine whether support is needed, and 
recalculate  that  support  at  a  much  more  granular  level,  so  that  the  town  centers 
and  outlying  areas  are  considered  separately,  and  the  support  migrates  to  where  it 
is truly needed the most. Not only would such an approach eliminate many of those 
dysfunctional  windfalls,  it  would  be  more  competitively  rational  because  it  would 
channel support to the truly rural outlying areas that need it the most, eliminating 
those  unsustainable  cross-subsidies  without  necessarily  increasing  the  size  of  the 
Fund. 

The  picture  in  front  of  you  shows  the  community  of  Fort  Meade,  Florida  [Fig.  4]. 
Each green dot on this picture is a customer’s location. There is a very clearly iden-
tified  downtown  area  which  is  actually  low-cost  to  serve;  then  there  are  outlying 
areas  where  the  cost  of  serving  is  many  times  higher.  As  was  the  case  with 
Meadowview,  when  we  see  competition  in  a  place  like  Fort  Meade  we  see  it  in  this 
low-cost  downtown  area.  As  a  result,  the  outlying  areas  are  the  ones  that  need  ex-
plicit support from the Fund. 

While granular targeting adds a heavy dose of rationality to the USF distribution 
process,  it  is  not  mutually  exclusive  to  other  approaches  under  consideration,  such 
as  reverse  auctions,  support  for  broadband,  modifying  the  ‘‘identical  support’’  rule 
or  eliminating  support  for  multiple  providers  altogether.  Each  of  these,  and  many 
other  policy  decisions  associated  with  universal  service,  represent  important  cross-
roads  that  will  have  impact  for  decades  to  come.  Granular  targeting  is,  however,  a 
competitively realistic first step for all of those larger decisions that could eliminate 
some  of  the  worst  abuses  and  realign  the  market  incentives  associated  with  Uni-
versal  Service  to  more  closely  match  the  program’s  original  purpose—providing  af-
fordable, reliable service where the market would not otherwise deliver it. 

Eleven  years  ago  when  the  Act  was  passed,  true  competition  hadn’t  reached  any 
of  the  town  centers  in  rural  America,  and  we  had  neither  the  tools  nor  the  capa-
bility  to  easily  calculate  and  target  support  separately  for  these  outlying  areas. 
Today we have both the capability and the tools. And we have one more thing: The 
incentive  to  do  this  right,  going  forward.  With  that,  I  will  close.  Again,  thank  you 
very  much  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  you  today,  and  I  look  forward  to  any 
questions you may have. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Dr. Staihr.

STATEMENT OF RICHARD N. MASSEY, 

EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CORPORATE SECRETARY, 

AND GENERAL COUNSEL, ALLTEL WIRELESS 

Mr. MASSEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. Vice 
Chairman.  And  we  appreciate  very  much  the  interest  of  you  two 
particularly, and of the Committee, in Universal Service. 

I  say  that  on  behalf  of  Alltel  Corporation,  and  also  on  behalf  of 
myself. I’m a citizen of one of the more rural states in the country. 
And  we  totally  ascribe  to  the  values  that  both  Senator  Stevens’ 
bill—the  USA  Act  included,  and  also  the  Smith-Dorgan-Pryor  bill. 
We  think  those  move  the  ball  down  the  field  quite  considerably, 
and we appreciate those efforts. 

Alltel is the fifth largest wireless carrier in the country. We serve 
about  11  million  customers.  However,  we  cover  about  one  and  a 
half  million  square  miles.  The—so,  we’re  the  largest,  in  terms  of 
geography.  So,  a  vast  amount  of  the  coverage  and  our  customer 
base  is  rural.  We  actually  have  been  in  the  rural  business—the 
rural telecom business for 60 years, so we know it pretty well. 

What  we’ve  learned,  spending  a  great  deal  of  time  with  our  cus-
tomer  base,  is  that  wireless  is  what  they  need.  Wireless  is  a  very 
critical  tool  that  a  number  of  businessmen  require  to  be  competi-
tive  in  this  world.  If  you  analyze  the  industries  in  a  number  of 
these  rural  states—I  know  this  is  true  for  Alaska,  for  an  example, 
and  for  Arkansas—the  industries  in  the  rural  areas  are  agri-
culture,  mining,  timber.  These  are  not  desktop  businesses,  these 
are  businesses  where  the  employees,  the  capital,  is  out  in  the 
world. And what those people tell us is, they want a wireless solu-
tion. So, we believe wireless is the future of a lot of the communica-
tions—maybe not all of it, but a lot of it—particularly with respect 
to businesses. 

Universal  Service  has  been  critical  in  the  development  of  the 
wireless  infrastructure  in  the  world.  I  can  tell  you,  on  behalf  of 
Alltel, there are a number of markets that would not be served but 
for Universal Service. So, it’s very important to us. 

I’ll give you an example. The Pine Ridge; it’s Pine Ridge Reserva-
tion,  South  Dakota,  is  in  one  of  the  poorest  counties  in  the  United 
States. When we found this market, some years ago, it included an 
incumbent wireline provider that receives Universal Service funds. 
Only 30 percent of the population on this reservation actually used 
telephones.  We  received  competitive  ETC  money,  and  built  the 
wireless  network  there.  And  today,  80  percent  of  that  population 
are wireless consumers. 

Senators  that’s  a  success  story  for  the  Universal  Service  Fund. 
We  believe  that’s  what  it  was  intended  for.  It’s  to  get  coverage  to 
people who can’t get coverage otherwise, or they don’t choose to get 
coverage from another carrier otherwise. 

So,  broadband  deployment,  we  totally  ascribe  to  the  views  of  all 
the  Senators  and  the  prior  and  current  committee  members  who 
believe  that  broadband  is  the  challenge  of  the  future.  We  believe 
it is the interstate highway system of the future. We, however, be-
lieve  that  it’s  not  necessarily  going  to  be  wireline.  We  believe  the 
future—that  broadband’s  future  is  in  wireless.  Today,  we  have  a

wireless  network,  as  do  the  Verizon  Wireless  folks,  that  provides 
data  speeds  that  are  comparable  to  DSL  speeds.  We  believe  that, 
in  many,  many  markets—in  many,  many  underserved  markets, 
this sort of technology will be preferred by the consumer. 

So, in essence, we believe Universal Service is critical to the com-

munity development of wireless in these underserved markets. 

Two  points.  The  myriad  number  of  reforms  that  are  here,  bewil-
dering  thousands  of  reforms,  is  very  complex  stuff.  There  are  two 
things  that  we’d  like  to  emphasize  here.  The  first  that  we  would 
like for you to make sure is included in any so-called reform by the 
Joint  Board  and  the  FCC,  the  first  is  competitive  neutrality.  That 
was  in  the  Stevens  bill.  Competitive  neutrality  is  two  parts.  One 
of them is competition. We believe that funding a for-profit monop-
oly is a bad idea. We think that kind of business went out of style 
about 50 years ago. We believe you have to fund some competition 
so that subscribers—so that customers can get the services they de-
serve. ‘‘Neutrality’’ means you don’t pick which technology is going 
to win in a particular market, you let the customer pick. That’s the 
way  the  Universal  Service  Fund  has  worked  to  date.  Customers 
pick  their  carrier.  They  pick  the  technology.  And  we  think  that’s 
very important. 

Finally—and  I’m  about  out  of  time—accountability  is  something 
we  ask  for.  We  want  to  be  accountable  for  the  funds  that  you  give 
us  to  build  out  networks  in  underserved  markets.  All  we  ask  is 
that  you  impose  the  same  standards  on  all  the  carriers  uniformly 
and fairly. That’s the essence of our proposal on reform. 

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD N. MASSEY, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, 

CORPORATE SECRETARY, AND GENERAL COUNSEL, ALLTEL WIRELESS 

On  behalf  of  Alltel  Corporation,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  for  inviting 
me to speak to you today. Alltel is based in Little Rock, Arkansas, and serves more 
than 11 million wireless customers in 35 states. Alltel operates the Nation’s largest 
wireless  network  in  terms  of  geographic  area  served,  but  our  customer  base  is 
smaller  than  those  of  the  larger  carriers.  This  is  because  we  are  one  of  the  few 
major  wireless  operators  to  focus  on  serving  rural  and  more  sparsely  populated 
areas. We provide leading-edge, digital mobile voice services. We are also rapidly de-
ploying  higher-speed,  mobile  broadband  services.  Our  EV–DO  based  AxcessSM 
Broadband  service  is  now  available  in  over  100  communities  covering  44  million 
people—including  numerous  high-cost  areas  where  we  have  been  designated  as  an 
ETC.  This  broadband  service  offers  speeds  of  400–700  kbps—comparable  to  the 
throughput of many DSL services in the market today.

Alltel’s  roots  go  back  some  60  years  as  a  rural,  independent  telephone  company. 
Although we are now exclusively in the wireless business—we spun off our wireline 
local  telephone  operations  last  year  to  the  company  now  known  as  Windstream— 
we  remain  true  to  our  deep  commitment  to  providing  the  best  possible  service  to 
rural Americans. I know there are many other rural-focused wireless carriers across 
the country and I acknowledge their great efforts as well. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chairman,  and  members  of  the  Committee,  I  would  like 
to  commend  you  for  your  work  in  this  area.  Members  of  this  Committee,  past  and 
present,  are  largely  responsible  for  the  Universal  Service  provisions  enacted  in  the 
Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  eleven  years  ago—and  those  provisions  have  been 
a great success in getting affordable telecommunications services, including wireless 
services,  out  to  rural  communities.  The  1996  Act  told  the  FCC  and  the  industry: 
let’s  preserve  and  advance  universal  service,  and  make  sure  that  consumers  in 
rural, insular, and high-cost areas have access to service that is comparable to serv-
ices available in urban areas. The Act also said, let’s get these services out to people 
using  a  pro-competitive,  de-regulatory  policy  framework  and  open  all  telecom  mar-
kets to competition. These policies are working well. Today’s Universal Service sys-
tem  is  bringing  the  most  advanced  services  and  technologies,  including  wireless,  to 
consumers across America—not just in metropolitan areas. 

Alltel  looks  forward  to  working  with  the  entire  Committee  on  Universal  Service 
reform  and  I  would  also  like  to  praise  Senator  Stevens  and  the  other  Members  of 
this  Committee  for  the  introduction  of  S.  101,  the  Universal  Service  for  Americans 
Act  (USA  Act).  This  forward-looking  bill  sets  the  right  course  for  Universal  Service 
policy by reaffirming the fundamental principle of competitive neutrality. Rural con-
sumers  will  benefit  most  from  a  system  that  promotes  Universal  Service  without 
interfering  with  competition,  and  without  unfairly  favoring  any  class  of  providers 
or technologies over another. We also are enthusiastic about the bill’s strengthened 
eligibility  guidelines  and  auditing  provisions.  These  will  increase  the  program’s  ac-
countability  and  will  ensure  that  every  dollar  of  high-cost  support  is  used  to  main-
tain  and  improve  communications  facilities  serving  rural  consumers.  The  bill  also 
wisely broadens the base of Universal Service contributors. 

Consumers  everywhere  increasingly  demand  mobile,  broadband,  and  other  lead-
ing-edge telecom and information services. Over the past 5 years, the number of mo-
bile  wireless  subscribers  has  grown  by  86  percent,  from  118  million  in  June  2001 
to  219  million  in  June  2006.  There  are  now  many  more  wireless  phones  in  service 
than  wireline.  According  to  a  survey  conducted  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health 
and Human Services, over 10 percent of consumers are using wireless as their only 
phone service. And among consumers with more than one connection, a substantial 
proportion  now  use  wireless  as  a  primary  means  of  communications.  Without  ques-
tion,  wireless  communications  is  the  ‘‘lifeline’’  of  today’s  consumers.  Meanwhile, 
wireless  broadband  service  has  grown  a  whopping  2,750  percent—from  about 
400,000 lines in 2005 to over 11 million in 2006.

We  are  seeing  these  same  trends  in  rural  areas.  Rural  consumers  increasingly 
want and need mobile wireless service. Many of you represent rural consumers and 
you  therefore  know  that  people  in  rural  areas  often  spend  more  time  than  their 
urban  counterparts  on  the  road,  and  depend  even  more  heavily  on  mobile  commu-
nications,  especially  since  desk  jobs  are  increasingly  moving  out  of  rural  areas  and 
into  city  centers.  For  example,  an  entrepreneur  may  need  to  reach  contacts  when 
driving  from  one  end  of  a  large  county  to  another  for  business;  a  parent  may  need 
access  to  telecommunications  while  driving  children  to  and  from  relatively  distant 
schools; and a farmer may need access to data on agricultural prices while working 
on a remote part of his or her property. Wireless broadband is often the only means 
of high-speed access in many high-cost areas and is playing a major role in bridging 
the  ‘‘broadband  divide.’’  Alltel  appreciates  the  emphasis  this  Committee  places  on 
the importance of high-speed deployment across rural America. 

A  critical  part  of  this  story  is  the  competitively  neutral  Universal  Service  high- 
cost  fund  program,  which,  thanks  to  this  Committee’s  efforts,  has  enabled  wireless 
carriers  to  serve  the  most  remote  parts  of  the  country.  Until  just  recently,  only  a 
negligible amount of Universal Service funding was going to support the deployment 
of  wireless  service  to  high-cost  areas—even  though  wireless  technology  and  net-
works  are  what  consumers  in  those  areas  need  and  want.  Of  the  $25  billion  spent 
on high-cost Universal Service since 1996, only about $2 billion has gone to wireless 
carriers and other competitors. Even today, less than 25 percent of Universal Serv-
ice  high-cost  funds  go  to  support  the  deployment  of  wireless  service,  even  though 
there  are  now  more  wireless  subscribers.  Wireless  contributes  more  than  twice  the 
amount into the Universal Service Fund than it receives out of the fund.

America  is  getting  a  great  return  on  its  investment  in  wireless  universal  service. 
It’s  true  that  support  for  wireless  has  increased  over  the  past  few  years.  But  that 
has  come  with  a  tremendous  expansion  of  wireless  service  into  rural  areas.  With 
Universal  Service  support,  we  are  building  facilities  deep  into  rural  areas,  not  just 
along  major  highways,  and  delivering  service  to  consumers  where  they  live  and 
work.  For  example,  on  the  Pine  Ridge  Reservation  in  South  Dakota,  the  tribe  esti-
mated  that  less  than  30  percent  of  the  population  had  telephone  service  prior  to 
Alltel’s entry into the market as a wireless Universal Service provider. Today more 
than 80 percent of the population on the Pine Ridge reservation has access to wire-
less telephone service. As Senator Thune knows well, the vast majority of these con-
sumers are eligible for and are receiving a discounted Lifeline service of only $1 per 
month. This is the true meaning of universal service.

Similar  stories  can  be  told  across  the  country.  In  rural  parts  of  Arkansas,  Lou-
isiana,  Maine,  North  Dakota,  West  Virginia,  and  many  other  states,  rural  con-
sumers are getting more and better wireless service at increasing broadband speeds 
as  a  direct  result  of  high-cost  Universal  Service  support  to  wireless  companies. 
Wireless  penetration  rates  went  up  from  41  percent  in  2001  to  68  percent  in  2005 
in the most sparsely populated areas with fewer than 100 residents per square mile. 
This is a tremendous success story.

Make no mistake—wireless carriers are receiving funds only when we step up and 
are held accountable to our commitment to serve the entire geographic area, includ-
ing outlying areas as well as towns and cities. To obtain ETC (eligible telecommuni-
cations carrier) designation and retain that status, we are required to make detailed 
annual  demonstrations,  to  the  FCC  and  to  most  state  commissions,  that  we  are 
spending  the  money  to  build  and  upgrade  cell  sites  throughout  our  service  areas, 
and  to  maintain  and  promote  top-quality  service  to  consumers  in  those  areas.  We 
are  held  accountable  for  every  Universal  Service  dollar  we  spend.  Alltel  added  nu-
merous  cell  sites  to  its  network  last  year,  a  significant  percentage  of  which  were 
the  direct  result  of  Universal  Service  support.  Our  capital  budgeting  process  con-
siders total funds available, including USF funds, when planning for new cell sites. 
Consequently, in each state where Alltel is an ETC, there are several cell sites built 
based upon anticipated Universal Service funding. Alltel expends 100 percent of the 
USF support on capital and operating expenditures within its ETC areas. And rural 
consumers increasingly are depending on wireless ETCs as their ‘‘carriers of last re-
sort.’’ When we use our USF support to build out new cell sites, we charge the same 
amount to everyone who chooses to buy our service; a consumer doesn’t have to pay 
any more to get mobile service once the network is in place. 

Simply put, with wireless high-cost universal service, you get a big ‘‘bang for your 
buck.’’ USF support for wireless in rural areas gives you a great return on your in-
vestment. So why do you hear complaints about growing high-cost support for wire-
less consumers? And why are many parties inundating the FCC and the Joint Board 
with  proposals  that  would  scale  back  support  for  new  wireless  networks  and  serv-
ices  in  a  major  way?  Alltel  urges  this  Committee  to  monitor  this  situation  closely 
as the Joint Board prepares to make its next set of recommendations. It’s true that 
the total high-cost fund is growing. But the solutions need to address the real prob-
lem.  Support  for  rural  wireless  is  not  the  problem—and  anti-competitive  proposals 
to reduce funding toward wireless consumers are not the answer. 

As  Verizon  correctly  noted  a  few  weeks  ago  to  the  FCC,  the  real  problem  is  that 
the existing Universal Service program is tailored to support traditional voice-grade 
services,  while  technological  changes  and  increasing  competition  are  transforming 
rural  consumers’  telecommunications  needs.  As  a  result,  the  amount  of  high-cost 
funding  per  line—to  wireline  as  well  as  wireless—is  growing  rapidly  without  effi-
ciently advancing the goals of universal service. 

So what is the solution? How can we place reasonable limits on the growth of the 
fund,  while  ensuring  that  we  spend  the  money  wisely  and  effectively?  How  can  we 
do  this  without  harming  rural  consumers’  access  to  competitive  wireless  and 
wireline services comparable to those available in urban areas? 

I  would  like  to  discuss  three  policy  recommendations  that  are  now  under  serious 
consideration:  (1)  reverse  auctions;  (2)  placing  ‘‘caps’’  on  Fund  growth;  and  (3)  tar-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

geting  funds  more  effectively.  Alltel  has  submitted  a  proposal  (see  attached)  for  re-
forming how support is distributed from the Universal Service Fund, including a re-
verse  auction  aimed  at  bringing  broadband  service  to  unserved  and  underserved 
areas,  a  per-line  cap  on  Universal  Service  support  for  basic  voice  services,  and  an 
approach  to  identifying  high-cost  areas  that  targets  Universal  Service  support  to 
those areas and holds carriers accountable for all support received. 

1. Reverse Auctions. The amount of Universal Service support could be determined 
through  a  competitive  bidding  process,  rather  than  through  an  intrusive  regulatory 
cost-accounting  system.  The  lowest  bid  would  determine  the  amount  of  USF  sup-
port.  Alltel  congratulates  FCC  Chairman  Kevin  Martin  for  advancing  this  innova-
tive idea, which is worthy of further development. As Chairman Inouye and Senator 
Stevens  have  correctly  observed  in  the  past,  complicated  questions  arise  in  connec-
tion  with  auctions  for  services  that  are  already  being  provided  by  existing  ETCs, 
and  there  could  be  serious  unanticipated  consequences.  Alltel  believes  that  it  may 
be  possible  to  resolve  these  issues,  and  ultimately  competitively  neutral  auctions 
might be a viable way to set support levels. 

Pending the resolution of these broader implementation questions, Alltel has pro-
posed  an  initial  ‘‘pilot’’  reverse  auction  program,  which  would  focus  on  promoting 
broadband  deployment  in  the  most  underserved  rural  markets.  Service  providers 
using  all  technologies  would  bid  competitively  in  a  single  set  of  reverse  auctions, 
and each participating ETC would have to make a commitment to provide substan-
tial  broadband  service,  as  well  as  conventional  services,  throughout  a  community 
within  a  specified  period  of  time.  The  lowest  bid  would  determine  the  level  of  per- 
line  Universal  Service  support  needed  for  the  auction  winner  to  fulfill  this  commit-
ment.  But  other  carriers  who  make  the  same  service  commitments  would  have  a 
chance to receive some support as well. 

The  key  in  this  or  any  USF  auction  system  is  to  make  sure  that  the  competitive 
bidding  process  does  not  displace  competitive  service  for  customers  in  the  market-
place,  post-auction.  Reverse  auctions  should  be  used  to  set  the  amount  of  funding 
per  line,  not  to  pick  a  single  ‘‘winner’’  as  the  exclusive  provider  of  supported  uni-
versal  service.  This  would  give  all  participating  ETCs  strong  incentives  to  build  fa-
cilities and get competitive services out to consumers in rural areas. 

Alltel strongly opposes proposals to use reverse auctions to effectively scale down 
high-cost funding for one category of Universal Service providers—wireless carriers. 
For  example,  consumers  would  not  benefit  from  the  anti-competitive  proposal  to 
hold  two  separate  auctions,  the  first  for  wireless  only,  and  the  second,  presumably 
conducted  many  years  later,  only  for  wireline  service.  This  imbalanced  type  of  auc-
tion  process  certainly  would  reduce  support  for  wireless  service  in  high-cost  areas, 
by  pushing  down  the  level  of  support  per  line  for  a  single  auction  winner,  and  pre-
venting  anyone  other  than  the  auction  winner  from  providing  supported  wireless 
services even if it is willing and able to fulfill the obligations of an ETC. The result 
would  be  to  dramatically  slow  the  rate  of  wireless  investment  in  rural  areas  and 
make it harder for rural consumers to access affordable, high-quality mobile service. 
But  this  approach  would  do  nothing  to  target  support  to  areas  where  it  is  most 
needed,  or  to  promote  deployment  of  next-generation  networks  in  rural  areas.  This 
Committee should be wary of proposals like this. 

2.  Caps  On  Fund  Growth.  Another  proposal  under  discussion  is  to  place  some 
kind of caps on the growth of the fund. A cap could be an effective tool in controlling 
the growth of the USF, provided that it can be structured in a way that helps rural 
consumers. In fact, Alltel has offered a detailed proposal to do just that. 

Another version of a fund growth cap has been offered by West Virginia consumer 
advocate Billy Jack Gregg, who appeared on the first panel this morning. Under Mr. 
Gregg’s proposal, the total funding disbursed to all eligible telecommunications car-
riers  in  a  particular  geographic  area—wireless  and  wireline—would  be  allowed  to 
grow  only  to  the  extent  that  population  in  the  area  grows,  plus  inflation.  But  the 
dollars  would  be  targeted  based  on  the  number  of  consumers  who  choose  to  take 
service  from  each  ETC—that  is,  based  on  the  number  of  lines  each  ETC  serves.  If 
you serve more customers, then you get more support. If a new carrier comes in and 
makes  the  same  ubiquitous  service  commitment,  then  it  would  get  a  fair  share  of 
the funding as well. 

The  idea  behind  both  Alltel’s  proposal  and  Mr.  Gregg’s  is,  if  the  country  needs 
to limit funding growth, then consumers should be the ones to decide where the dol-
lars  should  flow  by  deciding  what  they  want  to  buy,  rather  than  having  regulators 
make those decisions for them. This way, the competitor that attracts the most con-
sumers—by  providing  the  highest  quality,  most  appealing,  or  lowest  cost  services— 
will get the support needed to serve those rural areas. 

By  contrast,  some  have  suggested  that  separate  caps  should  be  imposed  on  wire-
less  ETC  fund  growth  and  on  wireline  incumbent  fund  growth.  Like  the  anti-com-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00088 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

85 

petitive  proposal  for  two  separate  auctions  (wireless  and  wireline),  this  proposal 
would  substantially  reduce  the  amount  of  funds  to  support  wireless  investment  in 
rural  areas,  but  would  fail  to  satisfy  the  fundamental  principle  of  competitive  neu-
trality.  It  might  limit  the  overall  growth  of  the  fund,  but  how  would  it  help  rural 
consumers?  It  just  continues  sending  the  money  where  it  has  always  gone,  without 
doing  anything  to  promote  investment  and  new  competitive  services  in  high-cost 
areas.  Again,  we  respectfully  ask  this  Committee  to  be  on  guard  for  competitively 
biased proposals. 

3. Target Funding. A third reform proposal is to target funds more effectively, so 
that  they  would  go  to  carriers  that  serve  consumers  who  actually  live  in  high-cost 
areas,  rather  than  simply  giving  the  funds  out  based  on  the  same  formulas  that 
have  been  used  for  decades.  Alltel  has  offered  a  detailed  proposal  to  target  high- 
cost  funding  to  geographically  disaggregated  areas,  so  that  funding  would  flow  to 
the highest-cost areas in each state, regardless of whether those areas were histori-
cally  served  by  large  or  small  incumbents,  or  by  wireless  or  other  competitive  car-
riers. Embarq, to its credit, has offered another, similar proposal, with funding tar-
geted  to  outlying  portions  of  a  study  area  or  wire  center,  where  costs  are  highest, 
rather than to town centers. Re-targeting funding more efficiently would enable the 
Fund  to  support  Universal  Service  goals  while  also  potentially  reducing  the  overall 
size  of  the  Fund  and—most  importantly—without  limiting  rural  consumers’  access 
to competitive service choices. 

Unfortunately,  the  existing  system  focuses  funding  on  carriers  with  high-cost 
structures, rather than on consumers in high-cost areas. Some propose to make this 
already  problematic  system  even  worse,  by  calculating  support  for  wireless  carriers 
based  on  so-called  ‘‘actual  costs.’’  This  would  target  the  most  funds  to  companies 
that  spend  the  most  money  and  punish  carriers  for  providing  service  more  effi-
ciently.  It  also  does  nothing  to  encourage  carriers  to  get  services  out  to  consumers. 
And it would require a complicated and unnecessary regulatory cost accounting sys-
tem  for  competitive  wireless  carriers.  This  system  doesn’t  work  well  today  for 
wireline incumbents. Why would we want to extend it to wireless competitors? 

In conclusion, I would like to thank this Committee once again for its commitment 
to policies that simultaneously promote Universal Service and advance competition. 
I  also  appreciate  the  efforts  of  the  FCC,  the  Joint  Board,  and  state  commissions. 
Universal service support is making a real difference in increasing rural consumers’ 
access  to  wireless  services  that  are  vital  for  health,  safety,  and  economic  develop-
ment. Wireless carriers like Alltel are helping bridge the geographic ‘‘broadband di-
vide’’ and are enabling rural communities to fully participate in our global economy. 
Going  forward,  Universal  Service  funds  should  be  targeted  and  spent  more  effec-
tively—but  without  driving  down  investments  in  wireless  networks  in  high-cost

RE: HIGH COST UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT, WC DOCKET NO. 05–337 
FEDERAL-STATE JOINT BOARD ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE, CC DOCKET NO. 96–45 
Dear Commissioner Tate and Commissioner Baum: 
Consumers  in  many  rural  areas  rely  on  high-cost  Universal  Service  support  that 
carriers use to make available affordable telecommunications services, such as wire-
less  services.  Since  the  entry  of  competitive  eligible  telecommunications  carriers 
(‘‘CETCs’’)  into  the  Universal  Service  market,  rural  areas  have  greatly  benefited 
from  the  deployment  of  basic  and  advanced  wireless  universal  services.  The  pro- 
competitive  vision  of  the  1996  Act  has  become  a  reality  in  many  rural  areas,  but 
there  is  more  work  to  be  done.  As  Universal  Service  reform  measures  are  consid-
ered,  such  as  imposing  reasonable  limitations  on  the  growth  of  the  Universal  Serv-
ice Fund, they must be accomplished without compromising the pro-consumer prin-
ciple  of  competitive  neutrality.  At  the  same  time,  Universal  Service  must  continue

to  evolve  to  promote  the  development  of  new  broadband  networks  and  advanced 
services. 

Alltel  submits  a  set  of  concrete  proposals  to  advance  these  goals.  We  propose  the 
immediate  adoption  of  a  new  ‘‘pilot’’  program  of  ‘‘reverse  auctions’’  focused  on  pro-
moting  broadband  service  for  consumers  in  the  most  underserved,  high-cost  areas. 
Pending development of a broader transformation of the system in the longer term, 
we  also  recommend  certain  transitional  reforms  to  the  existing  high-cost  support 
system  that  can  be  implemented  immediately,  designed  to  (1)  target  funding  more 
effectively  to  high-cost  areas;  (2)  impose  reasonable  limits  on  fund  growth;  and  (3) 
ensure greater accountability for the use of funds. 

To  date  the  explicit  Universal  Service  funding  system  has  successfully  brought 
consumers  in  rural  America  the  benefits  of  access  to  robust  wireless  and  wireline 
network  infrastructure.  Our  Nation’s  competitively-neutral  Universal  Service  pro-
gram spurs both wireless and wireline companies to expand their networks and in-
troduce new services for consumers and businesses in rural areas. 

At  the  same  time,  in  rural  areas  as  well  as  in  the  rest  of  the  country,  techno-
logical  change  and  increasing  competition  are  transforming  consumers’  tele-
communications  needs.  Consumers  increasingly  demand  higher-bandwidth  services: 
across the country, purchases of broadband lines increased by 52 percent from 2005 
to  2006,  according  to  recent  FCC  reports,  including  an  increase  from  fewer  than 
400,000  wireless  broadband  lines  in  2005  to  over  11  million  in  2006.  Use  of  tradi-
tional  voice-grade  wireline  telephone  lines  declined  by  3.2  percent  over  the  same 
time  period.  Consumers  also  increasingly  require  mobility:  mobile  wireless  service 
has  grown  by  50  percent  during  the  3  years  ending  in  December  2005,  and  con-
sumers now use more wireless than wireline lines. Rural consumers have the same 
interests in obtaining access to high-speed technologies and mobile services, and are 
demonstrating changes in demand that parallel those of consumers across the coun-
try. But due to the relatively high costs of deploying wireline and wireless networks 
in  many  rural  areas,  these  services  are  being  deployed  less  rapidly  in  rural  areas 
than elsewhere. 

The  existing  Universal  Service  system  is  not  well  adapted  to  this  changing  envi-
ronment, and a consensus is emerging that the high-cost support rules need reform. 
The  existing  system  is  designed  to  support  traditional  voice-grade  wireline  serv-
ices—for  which  demand  is  shrinking—and  does  not  target  funds  effectively  to  pro-
mote development of advanced networks in the highest-cost areas. As a result, high- 
cost fund amounts per-line are growing in many areas, without efficiently advancing 
the goals of universal service. 

The  specific  and  concrete  measures  we  propose—building  on  proposals  offered  by 
Joint Board member Billy Jack Gregg and a range of industry parties—will not only 
maintain the availability of existing services in the highest-cost areas, but also will 
target  funding  to  promote  new  broadband  services.  They  will  establish  greater  ac-
countability on the use of support funds and will set reasonable limits to the growth 
of  the  fund.  Critically,  these  proposed  measures  also  remain  true  to  the  Commis-
sion’s core goal and statutory mandate of maintaining a level playing field for facili-
ties-based, intermodal competition to serve rural consumers. 

These  policy  changes  will  affect  CETCs  as  much  as  ILECs.  Alltel  is  not  offering 
these  proposals  in  an  intent  to  benefit  or  harm  any  category  of  providers,  but  be-
cause they will promote the interests of consumers and advance the public interest. 

We look forward to working with you on these important matters.

Summary of Alltel’s Universal Service Reform Proposals 

‘‘Pilot’’ reverse auction system focused on broadband: Use reverse auctions to allo-
cate funds (starting at about $25 million) to bidders that commit to deploy basic and 
advanced  services,  including  broadband  services  (e.g.,  400  Mbps)  in  selected 
unserved and underserved markets. 

• Bidders would offer the lowest amount of funding needed to deploy to specified 

proportions of the population in the Zip code within given benchmark dates.

ing if they make the same service commitment.

more than the inflation rate. 

Reforms to the existing funding system: 
• To  limit  fund  growth:  Allow  per-line  support  in  each  study  area  to  grow  by  no 
• To  target  funds  more  effectively:  Disburse  high-cost  funding  to  geographically 
disaggregated  areas,  whether  served  by  ‘‘non-rural’’  carriers  or  large  ‘‘rural’’ 
ILEC holding companies, as well as CETCs: 
• For  purposes  of  determining  funding  amounts,  consolidate  all  ‘‘study  areas’’ 
served  by  a  single  ILEC  holding  company  in  each  state  into  a  single  study 
area. 
• Apply  the  ‘‘non-rural’’  funding  rules  to  such  study  areas  if  they  have  more 
• Revise  the  ‘‘high-cost  model’’  forward-looking  support  mechanism  for  ‘‘non- 
rural’’  carriers  (including  the  consolidated  study  areas  of  ILEC  holding  com-
panies  formerly  deemed  ‘‘rural’’)  to  provide  support  in  the  highest-cost  wire 
centers nationwide, not just in 10 states. 
• Require  all  rural  ILEC  study  areas  to  be  disaggregated  for  purposes  of  tar-

than 50,000 lines. 

geting support to the highest-cost portions of such study areas. 

• To  ensure  accountability:  Broaden  the  FCC’s  2005  accountability  and  reporting 
requirements and apply them to all ETCs, including ILECs as well as FCC-des-
ignated CETCs. 
• Require all ETCs (ILECs as well as CETCs) to document that they are using 
their funds to maintain and expand service availability for consumers in high- 
cost areas. 
• Make  USAC,  rather  than  NECA  (an  RLEC-dominated  advocacy  group),  re-
sponsible  for  collecting  and  processing  cost  data  and  determining  support 
amounts. 

To  protect  competitive  and  technological  neutrality:  Retain  the  rule  that  all  ETCs 

receive the same amount of support per line served. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, sir. 
And now, may I call upon Mr. Tauke? 

STATEMENT OF THOMAS J. TAUKE, 

EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, PUBLIC AFFAIRS, 

POLICY AND COMMUNICATIONS, VERIZON 

Mr.  TAUKE.  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chairman,  distinguished 
members  of  the  Committee,  this  Committee  has  shown  such  great 
leadership  on  this  issue  in  the  past.  We  thank  you  and  commend 
you  for  that.  And  we  are  encouraged  by  your  interest  in  the  ongo-
ing challenges with Universal Service. 

We  often  say,  in  the  telecommunications  world,  that  the  world 
has changed. And, indeed, the world has changed, and it’s changing 
very  rapidly.  But  the  Universal  Service  system  and  the  Universal 
Service Fund is stuck in the past. You’ve heard a lot today already 
about the problems with the Universal Service Fund and the chal-
lenges  in  trying  to  modernize  it  for  the  new  age,  the  new  era  in 
which  we  live.  I’d  like  to  offer  just  a  few  comments  to  supplement 
the statement that I submitted for the record. 

First,  I  think  it  is  helpful,  as  we  think  about  these  issues,  to 
think  of  them  in  two  pieces.  One  piece  is  the  Universal  Service 
Fund  today  and  how  we  fix  that  Fund.  The  other  piece  is,  how  do 
we  fund  the  infrastructure  that  is  needed  for  the  broadband  that 
we want to deliver to all Americans? 

The  first  piece,  the  Universal  Service  Fund,  has  generally  been 
focused on maintaining affordable rates for consumers. It is, if you

88 

will,  a  supplement  to  the  expense  budgets  of  companies.  The  chal-
lenge  with  broadband  is  that  you  need  huge  capital  expenditures; 
help,  if  you  will,  with  the  capital  side  of  the  budget.  Therefore,  at-
tempting to provide the same solution to both, in our view, does not 
get  us  in  the  right  place.  So,  I  encourage  you  to  think  of  these  in 
two pieces. 

First,  on  the  Universal  Service  Fund  piece,  then.  You’ve  heard, 
today, that there are a lot of problems with the growth of the Fund. 
And,  indeed,  there  are.  I’d  like  to  share  with  you  just  a  couple  of 
thoughts as to why the Fund is growing the way it is. 

The  first  problem  that  we  have  with  the  way  the  Fund  is  grow-
ing  is  that  we  have  multiple  carriers  in  many  geographic  areas. 
There are a lot of geographic areas around the country today where 
we  are  subsidizing  three,  four,  five—and,  in  some  cases,  more— 
wireless  carriers,  in  addition  to  the  wireline  carrier.  Now,  I  ask 
you,  if  the  public  needs  to  subsidize  a  carrier  to  provide  service  in 
a given area, why do we want to just subsidize three, four, or five? 
So,  the  problem  is,  we’ve  had  a  proliferation  of  carriers  receiving 
subsidies for the same area. 

Second  problem  is,  as  wireless  carriers  come  in,  the  Fund  ex-
plodes  because  of  the  nature  of  the  service.  If  I  have  a  home,  for 
example,  with  a  wireline  carrier  in  an  area  that  is  receiving  Uni-
versal  Service  support,  and  I  have,  let’s  say,  two  lines  in  that 
home, I get support for two lines. If my family has four people who 
have  four  wireless  phones,  and  the  wireless  carrier  applies  for  a 
subsidy, there are four subsidies going into that household. So, the 
subsidy  doubles  from  two  lines  to  four  lines.  The  wireless  network 
is paid on the basis of the cost of the wireline network, even though 
the  technologies  are  totally  different.  And  so,  the  wireless  network 
is getting twice as much support for that home as the wireline net-
work.  This  just  doesn’t  make  sense.  The  system  needs  to  be  re-
formed.  And  this  is  what’s  driving  the  cost  that  we  have  in  this 
high-cost area. 

Now, when you look at this problem, and you say you have mul-
tiple carriers, particularly wireless, who are receiving this cost that 
is  defined  by  wireline,  how  do  you  address  that  issue?  We  looked 
at  various  ways  to  do  it.  Do  you  want  to  go  through  cost  pro-
ceedings  for  wireless?  How  do  you  choose  one  of  the  wireless  car-
riers among all of them? Our view is that the best approach is the 
reverse  auction  concept,  so  that  in  areas  where  you  have  multiple 
carriers, that you look at this reverse auction concept, starting with 
the  areas  where  there  are  multiple  wireless  carriers,  and  use  that 
system to pick which carrier receives the support and also what the 
level of support should be. 

We  think,  then  the  FCC  should  take  a  look  at  how  that  works 
and  whether  or  not  that  approach  should  be  extended  to  other 
parts of the Universal Service Fund. But there has to be a mecha-
nism  to  stop  the  subsidy  for  multiple  carriers  and  to  stop  this  de-
pendence on the wireline costs to serve wireless. 

Second, in the broadband area—and I’m almost out of time—but, 
in the broadband area, we urge you to take a look at programs like 
ConnectKentucky.  Kentucky  is  a  tough  State  to  serve—tough  ter-
rain, dispersed population. Through the ConnectKentucky program, 
today that state has 94 percent of its homes connected, and expects 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

89 

to  be  close  to  100  percent  by  the  end  of  the  year.  They’ve  done  it 
by  targeting  support  to  areas  where  there  is  no  broadband  service 
today, and focusing on getting the capital investment through pub-
lic-private  partnerships  and,  in  some  cases,  with  Federal  funds, 
into the areas that need the broadband deployment. We think that 
approach,  of  focusing  on  grants  for  infrastructure  investment,  is 
the  best  approach  to  get  quick  action  in  the  deployment  of 
broadband throughout the country. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Tauke follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THOMAS J. TAUKE, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, 

PUBLIC AFFAIRS, POLICY AND COMMUNICATIONS, VERIZON 

Chairman Inouye and Members of the Committee: 
Thank  you  for  inviting  Verizon  to  participate  in  this  hearing  on  the  Universal 
Service program for telephony services. Universal Service is a longstanding and ap-
propriate  goal  of  telecommunications  policy.  However,  the  means  of  achieving  the 
goal  of  providing  affordable  telephone  service  to  high-cost  areas—the  Universal 
Service Fund—needs to be reformed. 

The  world  of  communications—driven  by  new  technologies  and  competition—has 
changed dramatically and will continue to change. This dynamic process has created 
new opportunities for consumers, while challenging all providers in the marketplace 
to reinvent themselves. For Verizon, this means investing in new networks, offering 
exciting  new  services  to  consumers,  becoming  more  customer-focused,  and  increas-
ing our efficiency in order to compete. 

Today the challenges of change are reaching all markets, including those in rural 
America. Unlike the days of yesteryear, most consumers in rural America now have 
a  choice  of  carriers.  But  in  two-thirds  of  areas  served  by  rural  telcos  that  receive 
Universal Service support, competitive carriers also receive subsidies. In those same 
markets, many new providers operate without subsidies. 

Unfortunately, the Federal high-cost funding mechanisms intended to ensure that 
Universal  Service  goals  are  met  have  not  adapted  to  the  changing  marketplace.  In 
fact,  these  programs  are  often  an  impediment  to  the  kind  of  transformation  con-
sumers and the marketplace require. Frankly, the high-cost Universal Service fund-
ing system is not working for consumers; it’s not fair, and we need to work together 
to change it. 

As  competition  and  technology  bring  consumers  more  choices  and  lower  prices, 
one  would  expect  that  the  cost  of  providing  Universal  Service  would  go  down.  But 
it’s not. Instead, the burden on the consumer to pay the cost of the Universal Serv-
ice  program  is  going  up.  The  percentage  rate  of  the  surcharge  on  phone  bills  has 
tripled, with more increases on the horizon, and in the past 8 years, high-cost fund-
ing has grown from $1.7 billion to $4.1 billion—a 142 percent increase. 

This  increase  is  driven,  in  part,  by  the  proliferation  of  new  communications  op-
tions for consumers. For example, when a family with one wire line buys a wireless 
family plan with four handsets, the Universal Service funding provided for that fam-
ily increases by a factor of five. 

Moreover, in many areas we are seeing three, four, even five wireless carriers re-
ceiving  Universal  Service  funding.  From  a  public  policy  perspective,  this  doesn’t 
make  sense.  If  the  consumer  needs  to  subsidize  service  in  a  given  area,  how  many 
duplicative  infrastructures  and  carriers  should  they  subsidize?  Necessary  reforms 
must  include  ways  to  better  target  support  only  to  those  areas  that  truly  require 
subsidies to ensure affordable access. 

Another factor that is driving increases in the Fund is that the amount of subsidy 
received by wireless carriers is determined by the cost incurred by wireline carriers 
to  deliver  service.  To  add  insult  to  injury,  as  wireline  telcos  lose  traditional  lines 
to  wireless,  their  per-line  cost  increases,  thus  driving  up  the  subsidy  per  customer. 
This increased subsidy is then passed on to all providers. 

The problem is not just that the Fund is getting bigger. Within the fund, the sup-
port  for  each  recipient  is  also  becoming  unstable.  A  telco  with  cost  increases  that 
are  more  than  the  nationwide  average  can  increase  its  support,  while  one  that 
spends  less  can  lose  support.  This  doesn’t  provide  very  good  incentives  for  carriers. 
Further,  in  order  to  keep  the  telco  high-cost  funding  within  its  current  cap,  the 
FCC raises the threshold for receiving support. Areas with costs close to the thresh-
old  can  lose  funding  entirely  as  a  result.  Yet  carriers  with  higher  costs  are  given

no  incentive  to  change  their  behavior.  This  churn  threatens  the  predictability  of 
support. 

Verizon believes that modernization of the Fund should be guided by the following 

principles: 

denied service without universal support. 

iting consumer costs to no more than is required to accomplish that goal. 

• First,  funding  should  be  targeted  to  geographic  areas  where  consumers  will  be 
• Second, the Fund should ensure affordable service in high-cost areas, while lim-
• Third,  a  new  policy  should  recognize  the  need  to  maintain  a  rural  wireline  in-
frastructure even as the number of wireline voice customers declines. 
• Fourth, a new and fairer system is needed to fund high-cost support. 
Reform  should  start  with  the  way  money  is  collected  for  the  Universal  Service 
Fund. Verizon supports reform of the pay-in mechanism to the Fund by basing pay-
ments  on  phone  numbers.  Tying  payments  to  telephone  numbers  ensures  that  the 
Fund is supported by all voice customers, and it substantially reduces the adminis-
trative burden. 

We also must reform the way money is paid out of the high-cost fund. Earlier this 
month, Verizon filed with the Joint Board a proposal (attached to my written testi-
mony)  that  would  modernize  the  high-cost  funding  mechanisms.  This  proposal 
moves us toward achieving the four objectives outlined above. 

It  meets  the  needs  of  rural  consumers  for  high-quality  services  at  an  affordable 
price.  It  stabilizes  the  fund,  encourages  a  competitive  and  innovative  marketplace, 
and  promotes  efficiency  so  consumers  are  treated  fairly  when  they  pick  up  the  tab 
for Universal Service support. 

Verizon proposes a ‘‘reverse auction’’ for the distribution of Universal Service sup-
port funds. To ensure an orderly movement to this new system for determining the 
payment of Universal Service support, we suggest four steps: 

First, we should stabilize funding in each geographic area, by initially capping the 
Fund in each area at current levels. This will protect consumers who are paying into 
the  Fund  as  we  move  to  a  new  system.  This  will  also  put  an  end  to  the  instability 
and churn of the current fund, making support more predictable. 

Second, the FCC should adopt a framework for competitive bidding through a re-
verse  auction.  Competitive  bidding  is  the  way  government  generally  procures  prod-
ucts  and  services.  It  allows  an  agency  through  a  transparent  process  to  select  the 
most  efficient  provider  and  to  get  the  best  possible  terms.  Consumers—as  users  of 
rural services and as payers of these services—benefit. 

Third,  this  market-based  process  should  begin  in  areas  where  there  are  already 
at  least  two  wireless  ETCs.  The  wireless  carrier  that  submits  the  lowest  bid  would 
enter into a contract, with a specified term, that spells out its obligations. The ILEC 
in these areas would continue to receive its existing support, subject to a cap. Once 
these  auctions  have  been  completed,  we  suggest  that  auctions  among  wireline  car-
riers be held in those few areas where there is a competitive wireline carrier receiv-
ing support. 

Fourth, after these initial auctions, the FCC should open a new proceeding to re-
view the auction process, and to determine next steps. The FCC might also use the 
results of areas where auctions have been held to adjust high-cost support for other 
areas. 

We  believe  this  approach  puts  in  place  a  more  market-oriented  system  that  will 
sustain  Universal  Service  in  this  competitive  marketplace.  While  today’s  recipients 
argue  over  costing  methods  or  administrative  details  of  the  fund,  our  proposal  fo-
cuses every provider in rural areas on the kinds of transformation that produce ben-
efits  for  consumers:  greater  efficiency,  creative  ways  of  doing  business,  and  new 
services. 

Let me close with three points on broadband. We all know how important the de-
ployment  of  new,  more  capable  networks  and  services  is  to  our  future.  Verizon  is 
a leader in that process. 

First, we believe that our proposal is the best way to allow the current Universal 
Service  system  to  play  a  constructive  role  in  the  deployment  of  new  services.  Each 
provider  in  preparing  its  bid  will  consider  all  of  the  services  and  revenue  sources 
in  its  business  plan,  regardless  of  whether  they  are  part  of  the  supported  service. 
For  that  reason,  the  support  provided  will  help  the  carrier  implement  all  parts  of 
its  business  plan.  This  allows  Universal  Service  to  support  basic  services  and  en-
courage broadband deployment in a market-driven way. 

Second, recognizing the importance of connecting America to broadband networks, 
we  believe  that  we  need  to  approach  policies  for  broadband  deployment  with  great 
care,  and  with  an  understanding  that  while  broadband  is  still  developing,  we  are

91 

seeing remarkable growth thanks to private investment. Policies that removed regu-
latory roadblocks have encouraged Verizon and others to invest heavily in new tech-
nology. 

Third,  beyond  that,  we  encourage  Congress  to  review  the  success  of  programs  to 
connect  Americans  in  hard-to-serve  areas.  Specifically,  we  call  to  your  attention  to 
the very successful ConnectKentucky program. 

ConnectKentucky  pulled  the  public  and  private  sectors  into  a  partnership  which 
has  already  made  broadband  accessible  to  94  percent  of  Kentucky  households. 
ConnectKentucky  reports  that  it  will  increase  that  number  to  close  to  100  percent 
by the end of this year. 

The  ConnectKentucky  program  began  by  compiling  an  inventory  of  the  current 
and  planned  investment  in  broadband  networks  in  the  state.  It  then  determined  if 
sufficient demand existed in unserved areas to command private investment. Where 
private  investment  was  not  likely,  the  program  focused  on  public-private  partner-
ships and securing public funding from various sources to build broadband facilities. 
This program is working because it’s focused on infrastructure investment. That’s 
the  key  reason  why  we  should  not  look  to  the  current  Universal  Service  Fund  to 
solve the broadband issue. The current fund is designed to provide sustained, ongo-
ing support to maintain affordable rates. But maintaining affordable rates is not the 
challenge  in  delivering  broadband  services  to  all  Americans.  Instead,  the  challenge 
in  broadband  delivery  is  coming  up  with  the  one-time  capital  investment  in  infra-
structure. 

In  most  places,  the  private  sector  is  making  that  one-time  capital  investment. 
Where the market is working, we should let the market continue to meet the needs 
of consumers. Where we determine that broadband is not available and the private 
sector  is  not  making  the  needed  investment  in  network  facilities,  we  should  target 
programs  to  support  infrastructure  investment,  perhaps  through  a  combination  of 
loans, tax credits, or grants. 

Verizon  believes  that  the  process  we  have  proposed  will  help  create  a  Universal 
Service Fund that is sustainable in this new telecommunications marketplace, while 
meeting  the  needs  of  consumers  in  high-cost  areas,  and  providing  carriers  with  the 
proper incentives to invest and innovate in the communications marketplace. 

Verizon looks forward to discussing and working with the Committee on this and 
other  ideas  that  further  the  worthy  goals  of  universal  service,  particularly  in  this 
time of innovation and opportunity that is being enabled by the communications in-
dustry. Thank you.

RE: IN THE MATTER OF FEDERAL-STATE JOINT BOARD ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE, 
HIGH COST UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT, WC DOCKET NO. 05–337; IN THE 
MATTER OF FEDERAL-STATE JOINT BOARD ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE, CC DOCKET 
NO. 96–45 

Dear Commissioner Tate and Commissioner Baum: 
This  proceeding  is  a  unique  opportunity  to  put  in  place  meaningful  reforms  that 
will  stabilize  the  Universal  Service  Fund,  create  better  incentives  for  companies  to 
serve  rural  America  in  efficient  and  innovative  ways,  and  lower  the  cost  of  access 
to  communications  services  for  all  consumers.  The  FCC  and  the  Joint  Board  have 
shown constructive leadership on Universal Service reform in order to bring benefits 
to  consumers  and  stabilize  the  fund.  It  is  the  right  time  for  these  important 
changes.  More  than  ever  before,  consumers  of  communications  services  have  op-
tions—especially  from  new  offerings  by  cable,  Voice  over  IP,  and  wireless  pro-
viders—and  they  are  taking  advantage  of  them.  But  at  the  same  time,  consumers 
are faced with increasing costs as they continue to support a Universal Service sys-
tem that is growing larger every year. 

The need for reform is becoming more urgent as the high-cost fund now surpasses 
the  $4  billion  mark,  with  approximately  $1  billion  flowing  to  competitive  eligible

telecommunications  carriers  (‘‘CETCs’’)  annually.  A  solution  is  needed,  and  the  an-
swer  is  a  system  that  not  only  controls  the  growth  of  the  fund,  but  provides  more 
rational  incentives  to  providers  and  ensures  access  to  important  services.  Reforms 
must  also  create  and  sustain  an  environment  that  promotes  innovation  and  effi-
ciency  gains  and  makes  sure  that  consumers  receive  the  benefit  of  these  innova-
tions. 

For  all  these  reasons,  Verizon  and  Verizon  Wireless  (hereinafter  ‘‘Verizon’’)  pro-
pose  that  reform  should  involve  the  use  of  auctions  or  competitive  bidding  as  the 
means  to  better  target  Universal  Service  support.  This  letter  proposes  the  basic 
structure  for  and  path  to  such  auctions.  Attached  is  an  Appendix  that  outlines  in 
greater  detail  one  possible  way  to  design  and  structure  such  auctions,  although 
other approaches and designs may be appropriate and workable. 

The  reform  plan  proposed  here  is  a  careful  and  measured  approach.  It  suggests 
immediate  action  to  address  the  most  pressing  concerns.  It  proposes  implementing 
competitive  bidding  quickly  and  on  a  limited  basis,  and  where  it  can  provide  the 
greatest  benefit.  It  then  gives  the  Joint  Board  and  the  Commission  the  flexibility 
to  assess  the  results  of  these  auctions,  and  to  decide  whether  to  extend  their  use 
more widely. 

Verizon’s proposal is as follows: 
First,  stabilize  the  Fund  by  placing  a  reasonable  cap  on  current  support  levels 
that  is  designed  to  control  the  growth  the  Fund  has  experienced  in  recent  years, 
introduce better incentives for all ETCs, and prepare for further reform; 

Second,  establish  an  administrative  framework  for  competitive  bidding,  which 

would include the auction design; 

Third, implement auctions to allocate funding for wireless CETCs. These auctions 
would  be  held  in  areas  that  currently  support  more  than  one  wireless  CETC,  and 
would  select  a  single  wireless  CETC  to  receive  support.  Once  these  auctions  have 
been completed, a separate set of auctions should be held for wireline ETCs in areas 
where there is currently at least one wireline CETC, to select a single wireline pro-
vider of Universal Service for the area. 

Fourth,  after  some  reasonable  period,  the  FCC  would  review  the  experience 
gained with the CETC auctions, and consider developments in technology and rural 
markets to determine an appropriate method for extending market-based efficiencies 
to additional areas. These methods could include: 

which would select a single Universal Service provider for each area. 

• A  single  auction  in  which  both  wireline  and  wireless  ETCs  would  participate, 
• The  use  of  representative  bidding,  based  on  statistical  analysis  of  the  auction 
results, to adjust support for ETCs whose support had not yet been determined 
by an auction. 

Step  One:  Stabilize  the  Fund  by  Placing  a  Reasonable  Cap  on  High  Cost 

Support at Current Levels 

As  commenters  in  this  docket  and  many  others  have  observed  repeatedly,  the 
high-cost  fund  has  grown  at  an  alarming  pace  in  recent  years  and  this  rate  of 
growth  threatens  both  the  viability  and  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the  fund.1 
It  is  also  increasing  the  amounts  that  consumers  must  spend  on  communications 
services. 

A reasonable cap on the high-cost fund is critical for at least three reasons. 
First,  the  growth  in  the  Fund  threatens  core  Universal  Service  goals  if  not  con-
tained. The USF contribution factor has risen dramatically in recent years. In 1998, 
the  contribution  factor  averaged  3.16  percent  and  has  increased  more  than  three- 
fold  since,  now  standing  at  9.7  percent.2 As  the  Fifth  Circuit  predicted  more  than 
5 years ago, ‘‘excess subsidization in some cases may detract from Universal Service 
by  causing  rates  unnecessarily  to  rise,  thereby  pricing  some  consumers  out  of  the 
market.’’ Alenco Communications v. FCC, 201 F.3d 608, 620 (5th Cir. 2000). 

1 The Universal Service Administrative Company (‘‘USAC’’) now projects that in the first quar-
ter  of  2007  the  high-cost  fund  will  top  $4.3  billion.  See  USAC,  HC02—High  Cost  Support  Pro-
jected  by  State—1Q2007,  http://www.usac.org/about/governance/fcc-filings/2007/quarter1 
.aspx. This is more than double the size of the Fund just seven years ago. See USAC, Universal

Second,  the  current  high-cost  mechanisms  do  not  take  into  account  the  benefits 
and  availability  of  new  competition.  Consumers  increasingly  view  cable  telephony, 
VoIP,  and  wireless  as  viable  alternatives  to  wireline  phone  service.  Competition 
from  these  intermodal  providers  has  increased  substantially  over  the  last  several 
years  and  has  brought  consumers  exciting  new  services.3 The  spread  of  new  inter-
modal competition in various ways and degrees into all parts of the country has ad-
vanced  Universal  Service  goals  tremendously.  As  intermodal  competition  thrives— 
and  drives  down  prices—subsidies  should  be  getting  smaller  or  even  disappearing 
altogether in areas where competitive carriers operate without subsidy. But just the 
opposite  is  happening.  Subsidies  are  increasing  even  as  competition  explodes  and 
rates continue to fall over time.4 

Third, a reasonable cap on support at current levels will put in place better incen-
tives  for  all  carriers  and  allow  them  to  adapt  to  the  new  marketplace.  The  high- 
cost fund in its current form is a product of an earlier time, before competition and 
technology  transformed  the  industry.  Today,  these  forces  are  compelling  all  pro-
viders to become more efficient and more creative, and to develop new services and 
new sources of revenue. Yet the current structure of the Fund discourages supported 
companies  from  transforming  themselves  in  a  way  that  advances  both  their  own 
long-term  interests  and  those  of  the  customers  and  communities  they  serve.  Cap-
ping  support  would  begin  the  process  of  introducing  market  incentives  for  innova-
tion  and  efficiency—a  process  that  would  subsequently  be  carried  forward  through 
competitive bidding. 

For  example,  support  from  the  rural  high-cost  fund  is  based  on  a  comparison  of 
each  ILEC’s  revenue  requirement  per  line  with  a  nationwide  benchmark.  This  may 
have  made  sense  at  one  time  in  a  less  competitive  market,  but  in  today’s  dynamic 
market,  where  the  number  of  traditional  telephone  lines  is  shrinking,  it  is  creating 
anomalous results and bad incentives: 

• Under the current rules, as a rural ILEC loses lines, its cost per line increases. 
Because CETCs receive the same amount of support per-line as the ILEC, over 
time  this  system  also  increases  the  per-line  support  for  each  CETC—even 
though  the  CETC’s  per-line  cost  is,  if  anything,  falling  as  it  gains  customers. 
• Each  rural  ILEC  can  increase  its  support  if  its  cost  per  line  grows  faster  than 
the  national  average.  This  creates  an  artificial  incentive  that  may  bias  ILEC 
decisionmaking,  since  the  system  rewards  higher  expenditures  and  penalizes 
cost reduction. 
• The  ILEC  portion  of  the  high-cost  loop  fund  is  capped,  but  that  cap  produces 
unanticipated effects, creating winners and losers among the ILECs, and a mis-
alignment  of  incentives.  When  the  total  amount  of  support  would  otherwise 
push the Fund above the cap, USAC raises the nationwide benchmark in order 
to  ensure  that  disbursements  to  rural  ILECs  do  not  exceed  the  cap.  This  has 
the  effect  of  eliminating  support  for  some  study  areas  where  per-line  costs  had 
previously  been  just  above  the  benchmark.  The  application  of  the  cap  thus  has 
a  dramatic  impact  on  the  support  to  those  ILECs.  Yet  ILECs  with  higher 
costs—whose  spending  may  have  caused  the  Fund  to  exceed  the  cap—have  no 
incentive to change their behavior. 

For these reasons, as the first step in the reform process, the Commission should 
stabilize  the  Fund  and  create  better  incentives  for  all  ETCs.  This  can  be  done  by 
placing  a  reasonable  cap  on  the  fund,  based  on  current  support  levels.  Support 
would be capped for each study area, with two separate caps, one for wireline ETCs 
and one for wireless ETCs. 

The  cap  on  support  for  wireline  ETCs  in  each  study  area  would  be  the  total 
amount received by all wireline ETCs in that area in a base year, and would include 
support  from  all  Federal  mechanisms  that  provide  high-cost  funding  (the  high-cost 
loop fund (both rural and non-rural), local switching, interstate access support (IAS), 
and interstate common line support (ICLS)). If more than one wireline ETC receives 
support  in  a  study  area,  the  support  amount  would  be  apportioned  among  them 
based on their relative lines. 

The  cap  on  support  for  wireless  ETCs  in  each  study  area  would  be  the  total 
amount  received  by  all  wireless  ETCs  in  that  area  in  a  base  year  from  all  the  sup-

port  mechanisms  listed  above.  In  a  study  area  where  there  is  more  than  one  wire-
less ETC, the capped support would also be apportioned among them based on their 
relative lines. 

In order to reflect changes in the overall need for Universal Service in each study 
area,  each  year  the  total  wireline  cap  and  the  total  wireless  cap  in  the  study  area 
would  be  adjusted  by  the  percentage  change  in  the  number  of  households  in  the 
area. 

The  particular  structure  proposed  here,  two  separate  funding  limits,  applied  at 
the  study  area  level,  will  accomplish  two  important  goals:  (1)  It  will  end  the  churn 
in  support—among  study  areas,  and  between  wireline  and  wireless  ETCs—caused 
by the current rules. As explained above, the current operation of the high-cost loop 
fund  is  producing  winners  and  losers  as  lines  and  support  amounts  change  each 
year.  The  more  targeted  cap  described  here  would  minimize  those  shifts  and  sta-
bilize  wireline  support  for  each  study  area;  (2)  By  applying  separately  to  wireline 
and  wireless  ETCs,  the  proposal  would  curtail  what  has  been  the  largest  source  of 
growth in the USF in recent years—new funding to CETCs. 
Step Two: Adopt the Auction Design and Framework 

After  the  cap  is  in  place,  the  Commission  should  adopt  a  framework  for  the  auc-
tion process. This framework would include administrative arrangements as well as 
the design of the bidding process itself. For auctions to be successful, proper design 
is  critical.  Although  the  exact  details  of  an  auction  may  be  flexible,  the  following 
are the key aspects which are necessary in this context: 
Areas for Auction 

As part of the framework, the Commission should choose the geographic areas for 
which auctions would be held. These areas would then serve as the ‘‘building blocks’’ 
which bidders could, if they choose, package together in the flexible bidding process 
described below. Auction areas should be small enough to allow the auctions to tar-
get support where it is most needed, but not so small as to create unnecessary com-
plexity.  Although  other  areas  of  similar  size  may  be  appropriate,  the  most  logical 
choice among the current alternatives (at least initially) is wire centers. These areas 
tend  to  reflect  information  about  where  rural  populations  are  clustered,  and  thus 
distinguish between high and low density areas, since ILEC switches have generally 
been  located  in  population  clusters,  for  example  in  the  center  of  a  small  town.  Al-
though  CETCs  have  different  network  topologies,  they  have  also  tended  to  locate 
their  facilities  in  population  clusters  for  similar  reasons,  and  these  areas  therefore 
tend  to  be  correlated  with  ILEC  wire  centers.  For  this  reason,  wire  centers  are  a 
reasonable choice for the areas to be auctioned. 
Package Bids 

The  Commission  should  adopt  an  auction  design  that  allows  bidders  flexibility  to 
submit bids for individual wire centers, or bids for packages of wire centers. An auc-
tion with this package bidding feature is called a ‘‘combinatorial’’ auction. 

Each bidder will be in the best position, based on its own business plan and mar-
ket forecasts, to determine whether it is better to bid on individual areas separately, 
or  in  a  group  or  package.  By  designing  the  auction  this  way,  the  Commission  and 
the  Joint  Board  would  also  gain  the  flexibility  to  use  relatively  small,  targeted 
areas, such as wire centers, as the building blocks for this process. In effect, rather 
than  deciding  itself  how  these  areas  should  be  grouped  together,  the  combinatorial 
auction allows the Commission to obtain this information from the market, through 
the decisions of the bidders. 

By  allowing  for  smaller  building  blocks  such  as  wire  centers,  the  flexible  auction 
design  would  also  provide  more  precise  targeting  of  support,  and  address  concerns 
about ‘‘cherry-picking,’’ without ballooning the fund. At the same time, it would give 
CETCs more flexibility to plan their market entry in ways that fit their technologies 
and business plans. 
Flat Payments to Auction Winners 

Auctions for high-cost support should be structured around bids for a flat amount 
of support. This approach offers several advantages. First, it eliminates the need to 
apportion support among different providers, avoiding controversial issues regarding 
whether  support  should  be  provided  to  primary  or  second  lines,  wireless  handsets, 
or  on  some  other  basis.  It  also  eliminates  one  of  the  main  sources  of  growth  in  the 
Fund in recent years: the addition of multiple handsets by each household. 

Each  bid  can  be  a  flat  amount  of  subsidy  for  a  given  area,  or  package  of  areas. 
This format is simpler and puts the responsibility for estimating demand in a given 
area where it belongs—with the bidders themselves. ETCs are in a much better po-
sition  than  the  auction  administrator  to  know  their  own  revenue  expectations  and

95 

cost  structures.  In  preparing  their  bids,  ETCs  will  evaluate  the  competitive  land-
scape  and  project  their  own  growth  should  they  win  the  bid  to  provide  supported 
services in an auctioned area. 

Finally, by providing support in a flat amount, this approach avoids distorting the 
incentive each ETC would have to gain or lose a customer. The benefit to any ETC 
of gaining a customer would simply be the additional revenue the ETC would obtain 
from  that  customer.  Further,  the  auction  gives  the  Commission,  for  the  first  time, 
a  means  to  set  the  flat  support  at  the  amount  that  is  just  sufficient  to  make  an 
ETC willing to undertake the burden of the Universal Service responsibility. Taken 
together, these features ensure that the proposed framework would not distort com-
petition  at  the  margin  among  ETCs  in  an  area  and  would  not  prevent  competition 
from occurring in an area that would otherwise have supported it. 
Auction Reserves 

Any auction for Universal Service support should include a reserve amount, which 
is  the  maximum  bid  that  would  be  accepted.  Reserves  are  commonly  used  in  auc-
tions  to  limit  the  range  of  possible  outcomes.  In  the  Universal  Service  context,  the 
reserve  ensures  that  the  support  determined  by  the  auction  is  no  greater  than  the 
amount of support provided prior to the auction. 

The  reserve  reflects  the  limit  of  what  the  auction  administrator  would  be  willing 
to pay. By selecting the most efficient provider, and identifying the support amount 
that  provider  is  willing  to  accept,  the  auction  offers  the  best  opportunity  to  obtain 
Universal  Service  on  terms  most  advantageous  to  the  public.  However,  if  no  bid 
lower than the current support amount is submitted, the administrator is better off 
reverting  to  the  existing  support  arrangement,  which  would  continue  in  an  auc-
tioned area where the reserve is not met. 

The  auction  design  included  here  suggests  two  reserves  that  would  each  have  to 
be satisfied: one that applies at the study area level, and a second reserve that ap-
plies  at  the  wire  center  level.  The  aggregate  reserve  at  the  study  area  level  would 
be  the  capped  amount  established  at  the  beginning  of  the  process.  The  wire  center 
reserve should be based on a pro-rata distribution of the study area support to each 
wire center, but with some additional amount added to allow for the auction results 
to direct more support to higher cost wire centers, and less to lower cost ones. This 
means  that  the  sum  of  the  individual  wire  center  reserves  in  a  study  area  would 
be  greater  than  the  aggregate  reserve  for  the  study  area  as  a  whole.  However,  the 
separate imposition of the study area reserve would ensure that the auction cannot 
result in an increase in support for any study area. 
Step Three: Auctions for Wireless and Wireline CETCs 

It makes sense for the Commission and the Joint Board to start, as an initial step, 
with  auctions  for  wireless  CETCs  in  areas  in  which  multiple  wireless  CETCs  cur-
rently  operate  and  receive  support.  This  would  be  followed  by  a  parallel  set  of  auc-
tions  for  wireline  ETCs,  in  areas  where  at  least  one  wireline  CETC  has  been  des-
ignated. 

Wireless CETCs operate on fundamentally different cost structures than ILECs— 
a  fact  that  has  long  made  the  Commission’s  portability  rules,  which  tie  CETC  sup-
port to the ILEC’s per-line costs, a primary target for reform. Starting the competi-
tive  bidding  process  with  wireless  CETCs  would  immediately  help  to  connect  wire-
less  CETC  subsidies  with  the  actual  cost  of  providing  wireless  services,  as  wireless 
CETCs bid against each other for support in those areas eligible for auction. A wire-
less  CETC  auction  will  ensure  that  affordable  wireless  service  is  available  in  high- 
cost areas, and that such service is provided by the most efficient wireless provider. 
Using  an  auction  to  select  a  single  wireless  CETC  in  each  area  is  an  important 
step  toward  rationalizing  distributions  from  the  fund.  Support  to  CETCs  (primarily 
wireless carriers) has caused substantial growth in the Fund over the last few years. 
In 1999, wireless carriers received approximately $500,000 in high-cost support.5 By 
2002,  wireless  CETC  support  had  increased  to  approximately  $45  million.  Id.  In 
2005,  wireless  CETCs  received  more  than  $600  million  in  high-cost  subsidies  and 
through  May  of  last  year,  that  number  increased  to  more  than  $800  million.  Id.  At 
this rate, CETCs will soon account for approximately 25 percent (if not more) of all 
high-cost  subsidies.  While  in  many  areas  a  wireless  CETC  may  ultimately  prove  to 
be the most efficient provider of universal service, funneling more and more support 
to  fund  duplicative  networks  in  high-cost  areas  should  not  continue.  With  wireless

96 

carriers  and  their  customers  now  paying  a  significant  share  of  the  Federal  USF,6 
wireless consumers will be harmed by continual increases in USF assessments. The 
public  interest  will  be  served  by  stabilizing  the  Universal  Service  Fund  and  direct-
ing wireless subsidies to the most efficient providers through the use of competitive 
bidding. 

The Commission should also allow for a reasonable transition for wireless CETCs 
that  are  receiving  support  today,  but  do  not  receive  support  after  the  auction.  The 
ILEC,  and  any  wireline  CETC  in  that  area,  would  continue  to  receive  support  on 
the basis of the capping mechanism established in Step 1. 

Once  the  wireless  CETC  auctions  have  been  completed,  the  Commission  should 
also  nominate  for  auction  any  area  where  there  is  at  least  one  wireline  CETC.  In 
these  auctions  ILECs  and  wireline  CETCs  would  participate,  and  each  auction 
would select a single wireline provider of Universal Service for the area. The reserve 
for  this  auction  would  be  the  total  amount  of  support  received  by  wireline  ETCs  in 
the  area  prior  to  the  auction.  These  auctions  would  be  held  in  a  relatively  limited 
number of areas, since wireline ETCs are designated in about 90 study areas today. 
Step  Four:  the  Commission  and  the  Joint  Board  Review  Auction 

Experiences and Decide Next Steps 

After  some  reasonable  period,  the  FCC  should  initiate  a  review  of  its  experience 
with the wireless and wireline CETC auctions. The Commission would consider the 
development  of  markets  in  rural  areas  and  changes  in  technology  and  determine 
next steps. Options would include: 

1.  Conducting  general  auctions.  The  Commission  could  decide  to  move  forward 
with  general  auctions  in  which  both  wireline  and  wireless  ETCs  would  participate. 
Such  an  auction  would  be  held  in  each  high-cost  area  where  there  is  at  least  one 
CETC,  and  would  select  a  single  Universal  Service  provider  for  the  area  to  receive 
the support determined by its bid. 

2. Using representative bidding. The Commission could use the results of auctions, 
where  they  have  been  held,  to  adjust  the  support  of  ETCs  whose  support  has  not 
yet been established by an auction. This use of ‘‘representative auctions’’ is an estab-
lished  practice  in  other  applications.7 Once  it  has  assembled  a  representative  sam-
ple of results from the areas where bidding has been completed, the FCC could com-
mission an econometric study that would relate the auction results to the character-
istics  of  a  high-cost  area,  such  as  size  and  density.  This  econometric  model  would 
estimate the likely results of an auction in an area with given characteristics. 

Results  from  wireless  auctions  could  be  extended  to  wireless  CETCs  operating  in 
areas  where  auctions  had  not  yet  been  completed.  Results  from  wireline  auctions 
could  be  applied  to  wireline  ETCs  whose  support  had  not  yet  been  set  by  auction. 
The support amount for these ETCs would then be set at the lower of the capped 
support  amount  or  the  amount  estimated  from  the  auction  results.  If  an  ILEC  be-
lieves  that  the  estimated  support  should  not  be  implemented  in  a  given  area,  it 
would have the option of nominating the area for an auction.

In its present form, Universal Service funding provides companies with the wrong 
incentives,  discourages  innovation,  and  has  increased  the  amounts  consumers  pay 
for  communications  services.  The  approach  outlined  here  will  help  remedy  these 
problems and transform the Fund into an efficient, market-oriented system that ad-
vances the core Universal Service objectives.

APPENDIX 

Modernizing Universal Service—A Design for Competitive Bidding 

This appendix illustrates one way the Joint Board and the FCC could implement 

a competitive bidding process for Universal Service obligations. 
1. Summary 

The  auction  design  outlined  in  this  appendix  would  introduce  a  more  efficient 
framework for the distribution of support to Universal Service providers in high-cost 
areas. This could be done in a series of steps: 

First, immediate measures would be taken to stabilize the fund, and to introduce 

better incentives for all ETCs, by capping support based on current levels. 

Second,  the  FCC  would  adopt  a  framework  for  competitive  bidding,  including  ad-

ministrative arrangements and the design of the bidding process itself. 

Third,  to  initiate  the  use  of  competitive  bidding,  the  Commission  would  prompt 
auctions  in  high-cost  areas  where  there  are  multiple  wireless  CETCs.  These  auc-
tions would select a single wireless provider of Universal Service for each area. The 
incumbent  local  exchange  companies  in  those  areas  would  continue  to  receive  sup-
port  based  on  the  capping  mechanism.  Once  the  wireless  CETC  auctions  had  been 
completed,  the  FCC  would  also  nominate  any  area  where  there  is  at  least  one 
wireline  CETC.  These  auctions  would  select  a  single  wireline  provider  of  Universal 
Service for each of those areas. 

Fourth, after some reasonable period, the FCC would review the experience it had 
gained with the CETC auctions, and consider developments in technology and rural 
markets to determine an appropriate method for extending market-based efficiencies 
to additional areas. These methods could include: 

• A  single  auction  in  which  both  wireline  and  wireless  ETCs  would  participate, 

which would select a single Universal Service provider for each area. 

• The  use  of  representative  bidding,  based  on  statistical  analysis  of  the  auction 
results, to adjust support for ETCs whose support had not yet been determined 
by an auction. 

2. Stabilize the Fund 

The FCC should start by taking immediate steps to stabilize the fund, bring fund 
growth  under  control,  and  put  in  place  incentives  for  all  ETCs  to  adapt  to  changes 
in  the  market  and  become  more  efficient.  This  would  establish  a  starting  point  for 
the implementation of competitive bidding. 

Support  would  be  capped  for  each  study  area.  There  would  be  two  separate  caps 

in each study area, one for wireline ETCs and one for wireless ETCs. 

• Cap for wireline ETCs. The cap on support for wireline ETCs would be the total 
amount  received  by  all  wireline  ETCs  in  the  study  area  in  a  base  year  (which 
could be the most recent twelve-month period for which data are available when 
an  order  becomes  effective).  The  cap  would  include  receipts  from  all  programs 
for  high-cost  areas  (the  high-cost  loop  fund  (rural  and  non-rural),  local  switch-
ing,  interstate  access  support  (IAS),  and  interstate  common  line  support 
(ICLS)).1 

1 For  ILECs,  once  the  cap  described  here  has  been  applied,  it  would  replace  the  calculation 
that is done today to determine support amounts from each of the existing funds. The exception 
would be the calculation for rate-of-return ILECs of the support amounts for local switching and 
ICLS,  which  would  be  calculated  as  they  are  today.  High  cost  subsidies  in  each  rate-of-return 
study  area  would  then  be  adjusted  to  bring  the  total  amount  of  support  within  the  study  area 
cap. The current cap on the ILEC portion of the high-cost fund would no longer be applied. For 
price  cap  ILEC  study  areas,  the  total  amount  of  wireline  support  in  each  area  should  simply

• If there is more than one wireline ETC in the study area, the capped support 
amount would be apportioned among them on the basis of their relative lines. 
• The  current  cap  on  the  ILEC  portion  of  the  high-cost  fund  is  producing  win-
ners  and  losers  as  lines  and  support  amounts  change  each  year.  The  mecha-
nism  described  here  would  minimize  those  shifts  and  stabilize  wireline  sup-
port for each study area. 

• Cap for wireless ETCs. The cap on support for wireless ETCs would be the total 
amount  received  by  all  wireless  ETCs  in  the  study  area  in  a  base  year  (which 
could be the most recent twelve-month period for which data are available when 
an  order  becomes  effective).  The  cap  would  include  support  from  all  programs 
for  high-cost  areas  (the  high-cost  loop  fund  (rural  and  non-rural),  local  switch-
ing,  interstate  access  support  (IAS),  and  Interstate  Common  line  support 
(ICLS)).2 
• If there is more than one wireless ETC in the study area, the capped support 
amount would be apportioned among them on the basis of their relative lines. 
• Increased  support  for  wireless  ETCs  represents  a  large  proportion  of  the 
growth  in  the  Federal  mechanisms  in  recent  years.  The  cap  would  stabilize 
the Fund and provide a starting point for the wireless ETC auctions. 

• Adjustment of the caps. Each year, the total wireline cap and the total wireless 
cap in each study area would be adjusted by the percentage change in the num-
ber of households in the study area. This would allow the cap to reflect changes 
in  the  overall  need  for  Universal  Service  in  the  area.  However,  there  would  be 
no adjustment for the total number of lines or handsets in the area. The current 
rural  growth  factor  (which  has  been  negative  in  some  recent  years)  would  be 
eliminated. 

3. Adopt the Framework 

Before any auction takes place, the FCC should adopt a framework for the auction 

process. 

a. Areas for Bidding 

The  FCC  would  first  designate  the  geographic  areas  that  would  be  used  for  bid-
ding. Areas should be small enough to allow support to be targeted where it is most 
needed,  but  not  so  small  as  to  create  unnecessary  complexity.  They  should  incor-
porate information about where rural populations are clustered, so as to distinguish 
between high and low density areas. 

Geographic  units  such  as  census  block  groups  or  counties  are  possibilities,  but 
these areas often cut across geographic barriers, such as mountains and rivers, and 
ignore  clustering  of  customers  that  would  be  relevant  to  any  prospective  provider 
of universal service. The arrangement of ILEC wire centers, however, contains use-
ful  information  about  the  geography  of  each  area  and  the  location  of  customers, 
since  ILEC  switches  have  generally  been  located  in  population  clusters  (in  the  cen-
ters of small towns). CETCs, while they have different network topologies, have also 
tended to locate their facilities in population clusters for similar reasons; they have 
put their facilities where the customers are. 

The  use  of  ILEC  wire  center  areas  represents  a  reasonable  balance  among  these 
considerations. If some other geographic unit of similar size is readily available, and 
meets  the  requirements  discussed  here,  then  the  Commission  may  consider  that 
unit in place of wire centers. Once a geographic unit has been selected, steps should 
be  taken  to  ensure  that  all  potential  participants  in  an  auction  would  have  ready 
access to data delineating the boundaries of those areas. An auction design that al-
lows  for  package  bids  (as  discussed  below)  makes  it  possible  to  use  areas  that  are 
smaller than a study area. 

b. The ‘‘Reserve’’ or Maximum Bid 

The  Commission  would  also  establish  a  maximum  bid,  or  reserve,  for  each  wire 
center.  Reserve  amounts  are  widely  used  in  competitive  bidding  processes  to  limit 
the  range  of  possible  outcomes.  In  this  case,  the  reserve  amount  would  be  set  at 
the  level  of  the  support  provided  immediately  prior  to  the  auction.  In  this  design, 
two  reserves  would  be  enforced:  the  first  at  the  study  area  level,  and  the  second 
at the wire center level. 

be capped, and if there are wireline CETCs in the area the support would be apportioned among 
the wireline ETCs on the basis of their relative lines. 

2 For  wireless  ETCs,  none  of  the  existing  funds  is  capped  today.  The  total  amount  of  funding 
to wireless CETCs in each area should simply be capped, and the apportionment among wireless 
CETCs on the basis of their relative lines would replace the existing fund calculations.

99 

The  aggregate  reserve.  For  the  wireless  auction,  the  aggregate  reserve  for  each 
study  area  would  be  the  total  amount  of  support  provided  to  all  wireless  ETCs  in 
the  study  area  prior  to  the  auction.  For  the  wireline  auction,  the  aggregate  reserve 
for  each  study  area  would  be  the  total  amount  of  support  provided  to  all  wireline 
ETCs in the study area prior to the auction. 

The  wire  center  reserve.  In  order  to  allow  competitive  bidding  to  proceed  at  the 
wire  center  level,  it  would  be  necessary  to  develop  a  reserve  amount  for  each  wire 
center. This would be done by disaggregating the existing support at the study area 
level in the following way: 

• First,  the  aggregate  reserve  in  the  study  area  would  be  divided  by  the  total 
lines  of  all  wireless  (wireline)  ETCs  to  derive  an  average  per-line  support 
amount. 
• Second,  the  aggregate  study  area  reserve  would  be  disaggregated  to  each  wire 
center on a pro-rata basis by multiplying the number of wireless (wireline) ETC 
lines in each wire center by the average per-line support amount. 
• Finally,  each  wire  center  amount  would  be  multiplied  by  a  constant  greater 

than one to arrive at the wire center reserve amount. 

This  approach  allows  a  reserve  to  be  developed  for  each  wire  center,  but  avoids 
the need for the Commission to develop detailed cost estimates by wire center.3 Be-
cause each wire center reserve is greater than its pro-rata share of the current level 
of  support  in  a  study  area,  it  also  provides  room  for  the  bidding  process  to  provide 
more support to higher cost wire centers, and less support to lower cost ones. How-
ever,  this  also  means  that  the  sum  of  the  individual  wire  center  reserves  will  be 
greater  than  the  aggregate  reserve  at  the  study  area  level.  The  application  of  the 
aggregate  reserve  ensures  that  the  bidding  process  cannot  result  in  an  increase  in 
support for the study area as a whole. 

c. Qualification Process 

Qualified  bidders  that  would  be  eligible  to  participate  in  the  bidding  process 
would  be  providers  who  have  been  designated  as  ETCs  in  the  area.  This  is  con-
sistent  with  Section  214(e),  which  requires  a  carrier  to  be  an  ETC  in  order  to  be 
eligible for support. 

d. Obligation of the Auction Winner 

In any competitive bidding process, the ETCs would be bidding for the obligation 
to serve as the provider of Universal Service in a high-cost area, in return for which 
it would receive financial support equal to the amount of its bid.4 The Commission, 
in  cooperation  with  the  states,  would  develop  a  statement  that  would  define  the 
winning  bidder’s  obligations.  This  would,  in  effect,  serve  as  a  request  for  quote  (or 
RFQ). 

In return for the Universal Service support, the winning bidder would be required 
to  offer  service  in  the  entire  area,  and  to  meet  any  other  terms  of  the  RFQ.  If  a 
wireless  CETC  bids  for  an  area  and  loses,  then  that  CETC  would  no  longer  have 
an obligation to serve that area. 

e. Schedule and Organization of the Bidding 

In  this  design,  competitive  bidding  would  not  take  place  simultaneously  in  all 
areas.  Instead,  bidding  would  be  introduced  gradually  through  a  series  of  transi-
tional steps. 

The  Commission  would  establish  a  regular  schedule  of  events  leading  up  to  an 
auction. This would include nomination of areas for bidding, registration of bidders, 
posting  of  deposits,  and  the  bidding  process  itself  (this  series  of  events  is  referred 
to  here  as  a  ‘‘bidding  cycle’’).  This  flexible  framework  would  allow  the  Commission 
to  manage  the  transition  to  competitive  bidding  in  reasonable  steps,  and,  at  the 
same  time,  provide  ETCs  themselves  with  the  opportunity  to  decide  when  an  area 
is ready for competitive bidding. 

• A  bidding  cycle  would  be  held  twice  each  year.  The  first  bidding  cycle  would 

begin 6 months after the adoption of an order establishing the plan. 

3 The  Commission  does  not  need  to  engage  in  detailed  cost  analysis  in  order  to  establish  re-
serves. In fact, part of the reason to use competitive bidding is to reduce reliance on traditional 
measures  of  cost.  However,  auction  results  might  be  improved  if  some  simple  indicator  could 
be  developed,  perhaps  based  on  the  size  or  density  of  the  wire  center,  to  differentiate  between 
higher  and  lower  cost  wire  centers.  Support  from  the  non-rural  high-cost  fund  is  already 
disaggregated to the wire center level. There is also a process in place for ILECs to develop and 
submit  proposals  to  disaggregate  study  areas  for  USF  purposes,  and  where  such  plans  have 
been approved, they could be used to calculate a reserve at the wire center level. 

4 Some of the Universal Service mechanisms, such as Lifeline, Link-Up, schools and libraries, 
and  rural  health  care,  are  not  related  to  high-cost  subsidies,  and  would  not  be  determined 
through the competitive bidding process outlined here.

• In  any  cycle,  a  wireless  CETC  would  be  able  to  nominate  for  bidding  any  area 
for  which  it  is  qualified,  and  where  there  is  at  least  one  other  wireless  CETC, 
except  in  areas  where  an  auction  had  already  been  held  and  the  term  of  the 
contract resulting from that auction had not yet expired. A wireline ETC would 
be  able  to  nominate  an  area  where  there  is  at  least  one  wireline  CETC  for  a 
wireline  auction,  except  in  areas  where  an  auction  had  already  been  held  and 
the term of the contract resulting from that auction had not yet expired. 
• At  certain  points  in  the  transition  process,  the  Commission  would,  on  its  own 
motion, nominate areas that meet certain criteria. For example, as discussed in 
Section 4, it would nominate areas with more than one wireless CETC to begin 
the wireless CETC auctions. 
• Dates would be established for the events in each cycle. For example, if a wire-
less  CETC  wished  to  nominate  an  area  for  bidding  in  the  first  half  of  a  given 
year, it might be required to file its nomination by February 1 of that year. 
• Once  an  area  has  been  nominated,  a  second  window  would  be  established  for 
ETCs to register to bid in areas that had been nominated, and to nominate ad-
ditional  areas.  This  would  prevent  an  ETC  from  gaining  a  first-mover  advan-
tage  by  nominating  an  area,  would  ensure  that  all  ETCs  interested  in  a  given 
area  are  able  to  participate,  and  ensure  that  all  areas  related  to  those  initially 
nominated can be included in the bidding process. 
• The Commission would set a firm date for bidding to begin. As described in Sec-
tion  6  below,  bidding  would  be  dynamic,  which  is  to  say  it  would  involve  mul-
tiple rounds. 
• By grouping all of the bidding processes for each six-month period together, this 
framework would simplify administration. And, by announcing a clear schedule 
of events in advance, the framework would also make it easier for ETCs to plan 
their participation in the bidding process. 

4. Auctions for Wireless and Wireline CETCs 

To  initiate  the  use  of  auctions  for  universal  service,  the  Commission  could  first 

prompt competitive bidding among wireless CETCs. 

In  each  area  where  there  is  more  than  one  wireless  CETC,  an  auction  would  se-
lect one ‘‘winner’’ to be the wireless provider of Universal Service in that area. Any 
area that had not previously been nominated by a wireless CETC, and where more 
than one wireless CETC is already certified, could be nominated by the FCC on its 
own  motion.5 Wireless  CETCs  would  bid  for  a  flat  amount  of  support  in  each  area. 
The design of the bidding process is discussed in Section 6. 

Once  a  wireless  winner  is  selected,  that  provider  would  receive  the  support 
amount  contained  in  its  bid.  The  ILEC,  and  any  other  wireline  ETC  in  the  same 
area, would continue to receive support under the cap mechanism described in Sec-
tion 1. 

The  FCC  could  publish  results  of  all  auctions  on  a  website,  where  that  informa-
tion  would  be  available  for  use  by  any  bidder  in  formulating  its  bid  in  subsequent 
auctions. 

Once  the  wireless  CETC  auctions  have  been  completed,  the  Commission  should 
nominate  for  auction  any  area  where  at  least  one  wireline  CETC  has  been  des-
ignated. In these auctions, both the ILEC and any wireline CETC would participate, 
and  the  auction  would  select  a  single  wireline  provider  of  Universal  Service  for  the 
area. 
5. FCC Reviews Auction Experience, Decides Next Steps 

After a reasonable period, the FCC could then review its experience with the wire-

less and wireline Universal Service auctions. 

The  Commission  would  consider  this  experience,  the  development  of  markets  in 
rural  areas,  changes  in  technology,  and  the  acceptance  of  substitutes  by  customers 
of different services. 

Based on this experience, the FCC would then determine whether it should nomi-

nate additional areas for auction. 

• A general auction. The Commission could prompt a general auction in any area 
where there is a CETC. Both wireline and wireless ETCs would participate. The 
general  auction  would  select  a  single  ETC  to  be  the  Universal  Service  provider 
for the high-cost area and to receive the support determined by its bid. The auc-
tion  design  described  here  is  intended  to  be  suitable  for  a  general  auction;  the 

5 The Commission could decide either to prompt bidding on all such areas in one bidding cycle, 

or could decide that it would be more convenient to spread the auctions out over time.

FCC could determine whether any adjustments would be appropriate, based on 
the experience gained with previous auctions. The reserve for this auction could 
be  the  sum  of  the  wireline  and  wireless  support  amounts  provided  on  the  date 
of the general auction. 
• Representative  bidding.  As  part  of  its  review,  the  Commission  should  also  con-
sider  whether  to  use  the  results  of  auctions,  where  they  have  been  held,  to  ad-
just  the  support  of  ETCs  receiving  support  not  yet  established  by  an  auction. 
Once it has assembled a representative sample of results from the areas where 
bidding  has  been  completed,  the  FCC  should  either  perform  or  commission  an 
econometric  study  that  would  relate  these  results  to  the  characteristics  of  the 
areas,  such  as  size  and  density.  This  econometric  model  could  then  be  used  to 
estimate  the  likely  results  of  an  auction  in  an  area  with  given  characteristics. 
Estimates based on the wireless auctions, or on general auctions, could be used 
to  adjust  the  support  of  a  wireless  ETC  in  an  area  where  a  wireless  ETC  auc-
tion  had  not  yet  been  completed,  (either  because  the  area  had  not  been  nomi-
nated, or because an auction in the area had failed). 
Estimates based on the wireline auctions, or on general auctions, could be used 
to  adjust  the  support  of  wireline  ETCs  whose  support  had  not  yet  been  set  by 
an auction. 

The support would be the lower of the capped support amount or the amount indi-
cated  by  the  econometric  study.6 If  an  ETC  does  not  believe  that  the  estimate  pro-
duced  by  the  econometric  study  should  be  applied  to  a  given  area,  then  it  would 
have the option of nominating that area for bidding. 
6. Design of the Competitive Bidding Process 

The  design  outlined  here  is  called  a  ‘‘clock-proxy’’  auction.  The  bidding  process 
would  be  a  hybrid  of  two  designs  that  combines  the  advantages  of  each.  The  first 
phase  is  a  clock  auction.  The  second  phase  is  a  proxy  auction.  This  design  draws 
on the latest work of auction experts in this area (including the Commission’s own). 
A  similar  design  has  recently  been  adopted  by  Ofcom  for  a  major  spectrum  auction 
in the United Kingdom. 

a. The Clock-Proxy Hybrid 

The  last  few  years  have  seen  significant  advances  in  auction  design  theory.7 One 
of these advances has been the development of a hybrid of two types of auction de-
signs,  a  ‘‘clock’’  auction  and  a  ‘‘proxy’’  auction.  This  hybrid  is  called  a  ‘‘clock-proxy’’ 
auction. 

The first phase of this design would be a ‘‘clock auction.’’ A clock auction is a dy-
namic, multiple round process in which the auctioneer announces prices and bidders 
respond with quantities desired at the announced prices. It is called a clock auction 
because the rounds of bidding are conducted at regular intervals. This design allows 
the auction itself to generate information useful to the bidders. By observing the re-
sults of the early rounds, each bidder gains knowledge of the value of each area and 
how  the  areas  are  related  to  one  another.  In  this  respect,  the  clock  phase  of  this 
design  is  similar  to  the  spectrum  auctions.  Importantly,  a  clock  auction  also  limits 
the  opportunities  for  bidders  to  engage  in  strategic  behavior  compared  with  a  more 
conventional  multiple-round  auction  in  which  the  bidders  themselves  formulate  the 
bids.  In  each  round,  a  bidder  can  only  answer  a  yes-or-no  question  for  each  area 
or package of areas: will the bidder be willing to become the Universal Service pro-
vider  at  the  support  amount  called  out  by  the  auctioneer?  This  kind  of  design  thus 
makes  it  difficult,  for  example,  for  a  bidder  to  use  the  amount  of  its  bid  to  signal 
other bidders. 

The  second  phase  of  this  design  would  be  a  ‘‘proxy’’  auction,  which  is  based  on 
the  results  of  the  clock  phase.  The  proxy  phase  is  necessary  to  make  the  results 
from the clock phase more efficient. It provides the opportunity for bidders to create 
combinations  of  prices  that  would  not  have  occurred  in  the  clock  phase.  This  is

called  the  proxy  stage  because  the  bidding  activity  is  conducted  by  a  proxy  agent 
(a  computer  program)  following  strict  rules  in  order  to  limit  the  possibility  of  stra-
tegic behavior by the bidder itself. 

b. Advantages of the ‘‘Clock-Proxy’’ Hybrid Design 

Flexible bidding for individual areas, or packages of areas. This design allows the 
bidders to place bids on different areas in a very flexible way. A bidder could submit 
bids on a specific area or areas. The same bidder could also submit a ‘‘package bid’’ 
on a group of areas, if the bidder found them to be related to one another (for exam-
ple,  if  the  bidder  could  serve  the  ‘‘package’’  more  efficiently  than  the  individual 
areas  separately).  This  type  of  bidding  process  is  called  a  ‘‘combinatorial’’  auction. 
A design which permits the flexibility of package bidding makes the choice of the 
area to be auctioned less critical. It would allow the Commission to design the auc-
tion around smaller geographic units (such as the wire center areas discussed here) 
without  unduly  complicating  the  bidding  process.  Rather  than  having  the  Commis-
sion  make  decisions  about  how  areas  should  be  grouped  together,  this  approach  al-
lows  the  Commission  to  elicit  information  from  the  bidders  about  how  the  areas 
should be grouped. This design would achieve more accurate targeting of Universal 
Service  support,  and  address  cherry-picking  concerns.  These  advantages  would  be 
gained  without  inflating  the  fund,  and  without  giving  up  the  economies  of  serving 
larger areas in cases where those are important. 

Allowing for different relationships among areas. The auction design outlined here 
is designed to perform well—in terms of efficiency, and minimizing the need for sup-
port—regardless  of  whether  different  bidders  view  a  given  set  of  areas  as  inde-
pendent, substitutes, or complements. This is important because in bidding for Uni-
versal Service support, all three of these are possible: 

• Areas  are  independent  if  a  bidder’s  willingness  to  bid  for  hypothetical  ‘‘area  A’’ 
is  not  affected  by  the  outcome  of  the  bidding  for  any  other  area.  For  example, 
a  small  ILEC  that  serves  a  single  wire  center  may  care  only  about  that  area. 
• Two  areas  are  substitutes  if  a  bidder  wishes  to  win  either  area  A  or  area  B, 
but  not  both.  This  could  be  the  case  for  a  wireless  carrier  that  wants  to  enter 
one  new  market,  and  is  considering  A  and  B  as  possible  alternatives.  If  in  the 
early rounds of bidding this carrier encounters strong competition for A, it may 
shift  its  attention  to  B  in  later  rounds.  This  kind  of  behavior  has  occurred  in 
the spectrum auctions. 
• Two  areas  are  complements  if  a  bidder  sees  some  synergies  in  serving  the  two 
areas  together,  so  that  it  would  be  willing  to  accept  less  support  in  area  A  if 
it also wins area B. For example, a mid-size ILEC that serves several wire cen-
ters in a state may view them as complements. In this case, strong competition 
for A may make this carrier less willing to bid for B. 

Some  earlier  proposals  for  competitive  bidding  of  Universal  Service  have  essen-
tially  treated  high-cost  areas  as  independent.8 For  that  reason,  they  do  not  make 
any provision for either substitutes or complements. The multiple-round design used 
in the spectrum auctions performs well when areas are substitutes, but not as well 
when they are complements. As explained in more detail below, the clock-proxy auc-
tion  design  will  perform  well  regardless  of  whether  different  bidders  view  a  given 
set of areas as independent, substitutes, or complements. 

Minimizing strategic behavior. The design outlined here also minimizes the possi-
bility  of  strategic  behavior,  such  as  collusion  among  the  bidders,  or  an  attempt  by 
one  bidder  to  conceal  its  interest  in  particular  areas  by  holding  back  until  the  late 
rounds  of  an  auction.  This  is  particularly  important  in  the  context  of  bidding  for 
universal  service,  where  the  number  of  bidders  for  any  given  area  is  likely  to  be 
small. Because this design encourages each party to bid straightforwardly based on 
relevant business factors, such as its expected costs and revenues, it would improve 
the transparency of the process, and the efficiency of the outcome. 

Single  Winner-Flat  Amount  of  Subsidy.  This  design  allows  for  a  single  winner. 
Thus,  there  would  be  no  need  to  attempt  the  difficult  task  of  apportioning  support 

8 For example, neither Milgrom (Paul Milgrom, ‘‘Procuring Universal Service: Putting Auction 
Theory  to  Work,’’  Lecture  at  the  Royal  Swedish  Academy  of  Sciences,  December  9,  1996)  nor 
Weller (Dennis Weller, ‘‘Auctions for Universal Service Obligations,’’ Telecommunications Policy, 
Vol.  23,  1999,  pp.  645–674)  allowed  for  package  bidding;  instead  they  proposed  a  separate  auc-
tion for each area. Since these designs were also single-round, sealed-bid auctions, they did not 
allow bidders to shift their attention from one area to another based on results in earlier rounds. 
The  only  provision  for  complementarity  was  a  limited  opportunity  for  a  bidder  to  withdraw  if 
it  wins  area  A  but  loses  some  other  area  it  sees  as  related.  Because  the  design  proposed  here 
deals  directly  with  package  bidding,  and  also  allows  for  multiple  rounds,  there  is  no  need  for 
such a withdrawal provision.

amounts  among  different  providers.  This  would  avoid  many  contentious  issues  that 
have arisen in the past, such as whether to support primary lines, additional lines, 
multiple  handsets,  and  so  on.  It  would  also  make  for  a  simpler  bidding  process. 
Each  bidder  would  bid  a  flat  dollar  amount  of  subsidy—the  total  amount  the  ETC 
would  accept  in  order  to  take  on  the  Universal  Service  obligation  for  a  given  high- 
cost  area.  Each  bidder  would  base  its  bid  on  its  own  business  plan,  which  would 
include  the  bidder’s  own  assessment  of  many  factors—including  the  demand  quan-
tities (of lines, handsets, etc.) it would expect to serve within each area. 

c. Clock Phase 

As  discussed  above,  in  the  first  phase  of  the  auction  (the  ‘‘clock’’  phase),  the  bid-
ding would proceed in a series of discrete rounds. Instead of having the bidders sub-
mit  support  amounts,  the  auctioneer  ‘‘calls  out’’  a  support  amount  for  each  area  in 
each  round.  Each  bidder  then  indicates  which  areas  it  would  be  willing  to  serve  as 
the  Universal  Service  provider  at  the  specified  support  amount.  The  clock  phase 
would proceed as follows: 

• The support amount called out by the auctioneer in each round is a flat amount 
per  year.  It  is  constant  each  year  for  the  duration  of  the  contract.  In  the  first 
round of the clock phase, the auctioneer calls out the reserve price in each wire 
center. 
• In  each  round  of  the  clock  phase,  each  bidder  may  submit  a  bid  on  a  package 
that  includes  any  area  or  combination  of  areas  it  chooses.  Since  the  support 
amounts  are  being  announced  by  the  auctioneer,  the  package  bid  is  simply  a 
list of the areas the bidder would be willing to serve for the amounts called out 
in  that  round.  Each  bid  is  also  exclusive  in  the  sense  that  at  the  end  of  the 
clock  phase  the  auctioneer  can  accept  only  one  bid  for  each  area,  and  one  bid 
from each bidder. All bids remain in effect for the entire duration of the auction 
and cannot be withdrawn (even after bidding has closed). At the end of the bid-
ding  process,  the  auctioneer  may  go  back  and  accept  any  bid  from  a  previous 
round.  This  means  that  a  bidder  must  carefully  consider  what  it  bids  in  every 
round, because every bid is a binding offer that the bidder might be called upon 
to honor. 
• At the end of each round, the auctioneer determines how many bids have been 
submitted for each area. The objective of the auctioneer is to select a single bid-
der  for  each  area.  Therefore,  in  an  area  where  more  than  one  bid  has  been  re-
ceived, there is excess supply. In areas where no bids have been received there 
is excess demand. In areas where there is excess supply (more than one bidder) 
the  auctioneer  reduces  the  support  amount  called  out  in  the  next  round  by  a 
set amount.9 
• The  auction  is  held  over  the  Internet,  using  a  software  program  to  administer 
the  bidding.10 The  program  includes  admission  control  to  ensure  that  only 
qualified  entities  submit  bids.  The  program  also  checks  to  see  that  bids  meet 
the  rules,  and  prompts  the  bidder  to  resubmit  a  bid  if  it  does  not.  The  rounds 
occur at some set interval, perhaps every 2 hours. 
• The  program  will  accept  only  bids  that  meet  the  wire  center  reserve.  It  also 
checks  after  each  round  to  see  that  the  aggregate  reserve  is  met  at  the  study 
area level, and provides that information to the bidders prior to the next round. 
• This  aggregate  reserve  check  can  only  be  done  after  a  round  is  completed,  so 
within  a  round  each  bidder  does  not  know  if  the  bids  being  submitted,  taken 
together,  will  satisfy  the  rules.  In  some  cases,  not  all  wire  centers  in  a  study 
area  will  have  been  nominated  for  bidding.  In  this  event,  in  order  to  apply  the 
aggregate study area reserve, the auctioneer would include the areas that were 
not  part  of  the  auction  in  the  calculation  as  if  they  had  received  bids  at  their 
wire center reserve amounts. 
• Each  bidder  would  be  subject  to  an  ‘‘activity  rule,’’  which  would  require  it  to 
bid actively in every round in order to maintain eligibility to bid in subsequent 
rounds.  This  rule,  which  has  been  used  in  the  spectrum  auctions,  prevents  a 

9 The  decrement  by  which  the  bid  is  reduced  each  round  is  an  element  of  the  auction  design. 
A large, or coarse, bid decrement will make the auction go faster, but may jump over the correct 
support amount. To address this issue, a device called ‘‘intra-round bidding’’ may be used to ob-
tain finer information from the bidders. Rather than simply drop out of the bidding for an area 
when  the  support  amount  falls  below  the  level  it  would  accept,  a  bidder  could  indicate  willing-
ness to accept a level of support between the amounts called out in the last two rounds. 

10 Having bids submitted electronically over the Internet, and using specialized software to ad-
minister the bidding process, has been used successfully in the FCC’s spectrum auctions, as well 
as many other successful auctions around the world.

each area. 

bidder  from  ‘‘lying  low’’  in  early  rounds  to  conceal  its  intentions,  or  to  allow  ri-
vals to eliminate one another.11 In areas where there are few bidders, the auc-
tioneer  may  limit  the  information  provided  to  each  bidder.  For  example,  each 
bidder may know the number of other bidders, but not the identity of each. 
• The  clock  auction  rounds  continue  until  there  is  no  more  than  one  bidder  for 
• At  the  end  of  the  clock  phase,  there  may  be  some  areas  for  which  there  is  no 
bid. There may also be areas where bids have been submitted, but these do not 
satisfy  the  aggregate  reserve  constraint  because,  as  discussed  above,  the  sum 
of the wire center reserves will be greater than the aggregate reserve constraint 
for the study area. 
• At the end of the clock phase, the auctioneer runs an optimization program that 
selects  the  winning  bidder  in  each  area,  based  on  all  the  bids  submitted  (this 
may  include  bids  from  earlier  rounds,  since  all  bids  remain  in  effect  until  the 
auction  closes).  The  optimization  seeks  to  select  winners  for  as  many  areas  as 
possible, while minimizing the cost to the fund. 
d. Proxy Phase 

Once  the  clock  phase  of  the  auction  has  been  completed,  a  final  round  or  ‘‘proxy 

phase’’ is held to ‘‘fine-tune’’ the results. 

The proxy phase is used to make the results of the clock phase more efficient. The 
proxy  format  opens  up  additional  bidding  opportunities  by  allowing  each  bidder  to 
specify package prices that might not have been announced by the auctioneer in the 
clock phase. At the same time, the proxy phase limits each bidder’s ability to behave 
strategically  by  having  a  proxy  agent  bid  on  behalf  of  the  actual  bidder  according 
to strict rules. 

In  the  proxy  phase,  each  bidder  reports  a  valuation  for  each  package  of  areas  in 
which  it  is  interested.  This  valuation  is  the  ‘‘best  and  final’’  support  amount  that 
bidder  would  accept.  Unlike  the  clock  phase,  where  each  bidder  specifies  a  single 
package  in  each  round,  here  a  bidder  may  submit  valuations  for  any  number  of 
packages, and the packages may overlap in the sense that a given wire center may 
be included in more than one package. 

The actual bidding is then done on the bidder’s behalf by a proxy, which is simply 
a  computer  program  that  bids  according  to  preset  rules,  given  the  valuations  sub-
mitted. Starting with the support amounts produced by the clock phase, each proxy 
looks for opportunities to make its bidder better off by submitting a bid on the bid-
der’s  best  package;  that  is,  the  package  that  maximizes  the  difference  between  the 
current  bid  and  the  bidder’s  valuation.  Bidding  continues  until  no  proxy  can  find 
any such opportunity. 

• The  same  reserve  rules  discussed  in  Section  3.b  are  maintained  in  the  proxy 
round.  The  activity  rule  is  also  maintained  in  the  proxy  phase,  but  may  be  re-
laxed  by  a  measured  amount  to  allow  bidders  to  increase  the  number  of  areas 
on which they bid. 
• In  practice,  the  proxy  round  is  implemented  using  an  optimization  program.  A 
winner  is  chosen  for  each  area  by  a  criterion  that  minimizes  the  total  amount 
bid over all areas. The amount of support determined by the optimization is also 
competitive  in  the  sense  that  no  coalition  of  bidders  can  offer  the  auctioneer  a 
lower-cost plan. 
• In  the  final  optimization,  there  may  still  be  some  wire  centers  for  which  there 
is  no  bid.  There  may  also  be  study  areas  for  which  bids  were  submitted,  but 
where the auction fails because the bids did not meet the aggregate reserve con-
straint for the study area. In these areas, the situation would revert to the sta-
tus  quo  prior  to  the  auction,  and  the  ETC(s)  that  participated  in  the  auction 
would  continue  to  receive  support  capped  by  the  mechanism  described  in  Sec-
tion 1. 
• The  proxy  phase  builds  upon  the  advantages  of  the  clock  phase.  The  informa-
tion  generated  in  the  clock  phase  helps  bidders  formulate  the  valuations  they 
are asked to submit in the proxy phase. 
• If  the  areas  are  substitutes,  the  clock  auction  may  also  do  most  of  the  work  of 
identifying  the  best  bids,  leaving  relatively  little  need  for  ‘‘fine  tuning’’  in  the 
proxy phase. 

11 Specifically, the rule employed here is called a ‘‘revealed preference activity rule,’’ which en-
sures  that,  as  the  support  amount  declines  during  the  rounds  of  bidding,  a  bidder  cannot  shift 
its bid toward a package whose support amount has fallen more than the support amount from 
a previously preferred package. See Ausubel, Cramton, and Milgrom, op. cit., at page 120.

• However, where areas are complements, it is likely that bidders may hold back 
from  making  some  bids,  and  the  clock  phase  may  end  before  all  of  the  possible 
bids  have  been  revealed.  Suppose  a  bidder  is  interested  in  a  package  of  areas 
A,  B,  and  C  which  it  views  as  complements.  Given  the  particular  support 
amounts  called  out  by  the  auctioneer,  and  especially  if  another  party  bids  ag-
gressively  for  B,  this  bidder  may  choose  not  to  bid  for  any  of  the  three  areas, 
even  though  its  combined  bid  might  have  been  superior.  By  giving  the  bidder 
an opportunity to specify a different combination of support amounts, the proxy 
phase  may  elicit  a  bid  for  the  package  that  would  be  better,  from  the  auc-
tioneer’s  perspective,  than  any  combination  of  bids  offered  in  the  clock  phase. 

7. Transition: Implementation of Auction Results 

After  the  auction  results  have  been  announced,  a  transition  period  is  necessary 
if  a  ‘‘winner’’  will  be  taking  on  new  Universal  Service  obligations.  For  example,  if 
the winner is a wireless CETC not already serving the area, then a transition period 
may  be  needed.  At  some  pre-announced  point  in  the  transition,  the  administrator 
could require the winner to post bonds to ensure performance of the contract. Later 
in  the  transition,  the  winner  may  be  required  to  file  an  implementation  plan  to 
show  how  it  would  plan  to  fulfill  its  responsibility.  This  would  create  an  incentive 
for  the  winner  to  formulate  plans  in  a  timely  way,  and  would  provide  the  adminis-
trator  with  an  early  warning  of  any  potential  problems.  A  transition  period  would 
also  allow  ETCs  that  had  participated  in  an  auction,  and  had  not  won,  to  adjust 
their business plans. 

Transition in the Event of a General Auction. Under this proposal, no general auc-
tion would be held unless the Commission took action pursuant to its review in Step 
4. If a general auction is held, and the ILEC is the winner, then no transition would 
be  needed,  since  the  obligation  it  would  take  on  would  simply  be  an  extension  of 
what it is already doing. If an ILEC bids for an area and loses, the state commission 
would decide whether and how to reduce regulation of that carrier and what (if any) 
obligation to serve would be appropriate. The Commission and/or state commissions, 
on  the  other  hand,  could  decide  to  exercise  their  authority  to  remove  obligations 
that the losing ILEC bidder may have to provide unbundled elements or resale. 

Although the winner would have the responsibility to provide service, it could ful-
fill  that  responsibility  by  contracting  with  other  parties,  including  the  incumbent. 
The  losing  ILEC  could  choose  to  continue  to  operate,  selling  retail  services  to  end- 
users. The state commission may reduce retail regulation of such ILEC services. The 
ILEC  could  also  sell  wholesale  inputs  to  the  new  Universal  Service  provider.  If  the 
FCC  and/or  the  state  commission  removed  UNE  and  resale  obligations  from  the 
ILEC, then these wholesale transactions could be at commercial terms. 
8. Terms of the Contract 

The contract between the winner and the regulators (FCC and state) would incor-
porate  the  terms  of  the  RFQ  and  the  level  of  annual  support  to  the  winner.  Like 
any  procurement  contract,  it  would  include  provisions  to  ensure  that  the  terms  of 
the  contract  are  met.  These  could  include  fines,  forfeiture  of  bond  amounts,  and 
being barred from participation in any subsequent auctions. 

The  contract  would  be  awarded  for  a  set  term.  The  area  could  not  be  nominated 
during  that  contract  period.  At  the  end  of  the  term,  the  contract  would  continue 
until a party—either an ETC or the Commission—nominated it again, at which time 
another auction would be held. 
9. Areas Not Yet Auctioned 

In some areas, support may not have been set through competitive bidding (either 
because the area was not nominated for bid or because the auction failed to produce 
a  result).  These  areas  would  continue  under  the  capped  support  arrangement  de-
scribed  in  Section  1.  In  an  area  that  receives  no  support  today,  the  reserve  would 
be zero, and thus that area would not be eligible for auction.

mittee  hearing  this  morning—for  not  being  here  for  all  the  testi-
mony. I thank our witnesses. 

And  I  particularly  want  to  welcome  here  a  South  Dakotan.  Tom 
Simmons  is  the  Senior  Vice  President  of  Public  Policy  for 
Midcontinent  Communications,  which  is  located  in  Sioux  Falls, 
South  Dakota.  And  I  happen  to  be  a  subscriber.  They  provide 
phone, they provide Internet, they provide video. And so, I have all 
those at my home in Sioux Falls. And I appreciate the efforts that 
they’re  making  to  improve  those  services  all  across  South  Dakota. 
As  you  know,  I’m  a  cosponsor  of  Senator  Stevens’  bill  that  deals 
with  USF,  both  on  the  distribution  mechanism  and  the  contribu-
tion mechanism, and think that that—can improve the way that we 
go  about  reaching  some  of  these  areas  that  aren’t  reached  and  de-
livering  broadband  to  more  areas  across  the  country.  But  I  cer-
tainly welcome other thoughts about how to do that, whether or not 
those  are  the  best  solutions  or  whether—there  are  perhaps  other 
ideas that might be even better ones. 

So, thank you Tom, for being here today, for making the trip out 
from South Dakota, and to all our witnesses for their excellent tes-
timony. And we’ll look forward to moving forward with some legis-
lation that will address this very important issue. 

Thanks. 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Simmons? 
STATEMENT OF W. TOM SIMMONS, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, 

PUBLIC POLICY, MIDCONTINENT COMMUNICATIONS 

Mr.  SIMMONS.  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  mem-
bers  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  today. 
My name is Tom Simmons. I’m the Senior Vice President of Pub-
lic  Policy  for  Midcontinent  Communications,  a  leading  provider  of 
cable  telecommunications  services,  including  analog  and  digital 
cable  television,  broadband  Internet,  long-distance  and  local  tele-
phone services. We serve approximately 200 communities in North 
and  South  Dakota,  western  Minnesota,  and  northern  Nebraska, 
generally  classified  as  small  or  rural.  The  size  of  our  communities 
range from densities of 5 to 116 homes per mile of cable plant, and 
populations  range  from  less  than  30,  in  Barlow,  North  Dakota,  to 
our  largest  community,  in  Sioux  Falls,  home  of  Senator  John 
Thune, which has a population of more than 140,000. 

Midcontinent  launched  its  broadband  Internet  service  over  10 
years  ago,  on  April  15,  1996,  in  Aberdeen,  South  Dakota.  At  that 
time,  we  made  a  pledge  to  bring  advanced  broadband  services  to 
as  many  customers  as  possible,  regardless  of  the  size  of  the  com-
munity. 

At  the  end  of  last  year,  we  completed  a  project  to  rebuild  our 
cable  plant  to  750  megahertz  or  better  in  50  more  Midcontinent 
communities,  bringing  our  total  number  of  upgraded  systems  to 
over  156;  and  that  serves  95  percent  of  Midcontinent’s  customers. 
Customers  in  these  communities  now  enjoy  over  150  channels  of 
analog  and  digital  video  programming,  broadband,  high-speed 
Internet  service,  high-definition  television,  digital  video  recording, 
and video on demand. 

I’d like to start by simply pointing out that the entry of cable op-
erators into telephony is great news for consumers across America.

According to recent reports, cable phone customers are saving over 
$10  a  month  on  their  phone  bills,  and  the  anticipated  consumer 
benefit from competition over the next 5 years will total more than 
$100 billion. And cable operators like Midcontinent are increasingly 
bringing benefits of their competitive phone services to rural areas. 
As  I  testified  last  Congress  before  this  Committee,  Midcontinent 
strongly  supports  the  goals  and  purposes  of  Universal  Service.  We 
believe  that  quality  telecommunications  services  should  be  avail-
able to all regions of the country at just, affordable, and reasonable 
rates.  A  strong  Universal  Service  program  is  an  essential  compo-
nent  of  national  telecommunications  policy,  and  we  share  the  con-
cern  of  policymakers,  industry  stakeholders,  and  the  public,  that, 
in  its  current  form,  the  Universal  Service  program  is  not  sustain-
able. 

But, while there is general consensus that all aspects of the sys-
tem, including contributions, eligibility, and level of support, are in 
need of reform, there are a wide range of views as to how the pro-
gram should be restructured. 

With  respect  to  distribution-related  Universal  Service  issues,  we 
believe  it  would  be  a  mistake  to  make  broadband  services  eligible 
for  USF  distributions  in  areas  that  already  have  a  broadband  pro-
vider. It’s unnecessary and profoundly unfair for the government to 
subsidize  a  broadband  competitor  to  Midcontinent  or  any  other 
broadband  provider  that  has  already  stepped  up  to  the  plate  and 
answered the call to help close the digital divide. Subsidizing com-
petition is also a waste of scarce resources that should be targeted 
to areas where a market-based solution has not developed. 

Also,  the  continued  growth  in  the  size  of  the  Fund  is  a  matter 
of  significant  concern  to  the  cable  industry,  for  a  very  simple  rea-
son: these costs ultimately are borne by consumers. 

Our  industry  supports  efforts  to  reduce  the  burden  of  Federal 
support  programs  by  more  efficiently  distributing  support.  In  par-
ticular,  we  believe  that  reverse  auctions,  if  structured  properly, 
offer  an  opportunity  not  only  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  Fund,  but 
also  promote  competition  in  high-cost  areas  by  making  support 
available on a more equitable basis. 

Turning to the current USF contribution mechanism, cable recog-
nizes  that  reliance  on  the  assessment  of  interstate  telecommuni-
cations  revenues  virtually  guarantees  that  the  funding  base  will 
continue to shrink. To address this, the cable industry has long ad-
vocated  the  adoption  of  a  telephone-numbers-based  contribution 
mechanism,  a  simple,  yet  effective,  reform  that  will  sustain  the 
long-term  health  of  this  Fund  while  adapting  to  the  evolving  tech-
nology and economics of voice telephony. 

As  stated  above,  Midcontinent  and  the  cable  industry  strongly 
support  the  goals  and  purposes  of  the  Universal  Service  program. 
We recognize that changes are necessary to ensure its continued vi-
ability.  We  appreciate  that  the  legislation  introduced  by  Vice 
Chairman  Stevens  would  give  the  FCC  the  option  of  establishing 
a  numbers-based  assessment  scheme.  And  we’d  like  to  work  with 
this  Committee  to  give  priority  to  a  numbers-based  option  and  en-
sure  that  future  assessments  are  not  extended  to  broadband  and 
Internet services.

The  imposition  of  new  fees  on  broadband  service  at  the  same 
time  policymakers  seek  to  encourage  more  widespread  deployment 
and  service  penetration  would  be  counterproductive  and  would 
raise  the  price  of  high-speed  Internet  services  for  current  and  po-
tential broadband customers. It would also penalize those who have 
worked  diligently  to  deploy  broadband  to  nearly  every  part  of  the 
country. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for inviting me to testify today. I’d be 
happy  to  answer  your  questions,  or  those  of  the  members  of  the 
Committee. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Simmons follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF W. TOM SIMMONS, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, 

PUBLIC POLICY, MIDCONTINENT COMMUNICATIONS 

Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens  and  members  of  the  Committee  thank 
you for inviting me to testify today. My name is Tom Simmons and I am the Senior 
Vice President of Public Policy for Midcontinent Communications, a leading provider 
of  cable  telecommunications  services  including  analog  and  digital  cable  television, 
broadband  Internet  and  local  and  long  distance  telephone  services.  We  serve  over 
200,000  customers  in  approximately  200  communities  in  North  and  South  Dakota, 
western  Minnesota,  and  northern  Nebraska  generally  classified  as  small  or  rural. 
The size of our communities range from densities of 5 to 116 homes per mile of cable 
plant  and  populations  ranging  from  less  than  30  in  Barlow,  North  Dakota  to  our 
largest community, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, which has a population of more than 
140,000. 

Midcontinent launched its broadband Internet service over 10 years ago, on April 
15,  1996  in  Aberdeen,  South  Dakota,  and  made  a  pledge  then  to  bring  advanced 
broadband  services  to  as  many  customers  as  possible  regardless  of  the  size  of  com-
munity.  At  the  end  of  2005,  we  completed  a  project  to  rebuild  our  cable  plant  to 
750 MHz or better in 50 more Midcontinent communities bringing our total number 
of  upgraded  systems  to  156,  serving  over  95  percent  of  Midcontinent’s  customers. 
Customers in these communities now enjoy over 150 channels of analog and digital 
video  programming,  broadband  Internet  service,  high  definition  television,  and  dig-
ital  video  recording  capability.  Midcontinent  Communications  is  also  a  certificated 
local exchange telephone service provider in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Min-
nesota.  Midcontinent  first  launched  facility  based  circuit-switched  telephony  in 
2000,  and  in  the  last  year  launched  its  first  digital  VoIP  phone  service  in  Mitchell, 
South  Dakota.  Since  then,  we’ve  rolled  out  digital  phone  services  in  a  number  of 
additional  communities  throughout  our  service  area  and  plan  to  continue  the  con-
version  of  analog  to  digital  telephony  in  many  more.  Midcontinent  is  a  privately 
held company that has invested, and continues to invest, substantial amounts of pri-
vate risk capital to bring advanced services to our customers without the assistance 
of  public  funds.  We’re  proud  of  our  ability  to  deliver  the  services  our  customers  de-
mand,  which  are  no  less  than  those  demanded  and  expected  in  major  metropolitan 
areas. 

As  a  provider  of  telephone  service  in  rural  America,  Midcontinent  strongly  sup-
ports  the  goals  and  purposes  of  the  Universal  Service  Fund  (USF).  We  believe  that 
quality telecommunications services should be available to all regions of the country 
at  just,  affordable  and  reasonable  rates.  In  that  regard,  even  prior  to  the  Federal 
Communications  Commission’s  recent  order  requiring  that  all  VoIP  providers  pay 
into  the  USF,  Midcontinent  and  all  other  cable  operators  offering  voice  telephone 
service—either  by  way  of  traditional  circuit-switched  telephony  or  VoIP—have  al-
ways contributed to the Universal Service Fund. 

The entry of cable operators into the telephony marketplace is great news for con-
sumers  across  America.  According  to  a  recent  J.D.  Power  report,  cable  phone  cus-
tomers  are  saving  over  $10  a  month  on  their  phone  bills.  Based  on  the  projected 
growth  of  cable  phone  services,  Microeconomic  Consulting  and  Research  Associates 
recently projected that the total anticipated consumer benefit from competition over 
the  next  5  years  will  total  more  than  $100  billion.  And  cable  operators,  such  as 
Midcontinent,  are  increasingly  bringing  the  benefits  of  their  competitive  telephone 
services to rural areas. 

A  strong  Universal  Service  program  is  an  essential  component  of  national  tele-
communications  policy  and  we  share  the  concerns  of  policymakers,  industry  stake-
holders  and  the  public  that,  in  its  current  form,  the  Universal  Service  program  is

not sustainable. While there is general consensus that all aspects of the system, in-
cluding contributions, eligibility and level of support are in need of reform, there are 
a wide range of views as to how the program should be restructured. 

With  respect  to  distribution  related  Universal  Service  issues,  we  recognize  the 
value  in  preserving  and  promoting  this  program  which  provides  funding  to  compa-
nies  that  serve  areas  where  market  forces  historically  might  not  have  resulted  in 
all  customers  being  served.  These  market  forces,  however,  are  not  static.  Improve-
ments in technology, particularly the transition to IP-based equipment and services, 
have  made  it  possible  for  cable  operators  and  other  facilities-based  competitors  to 
serve  areas  that  previously  might  not  have  supported  competitive  entry.  Similarly, 
incumbent local exchange carriers increasingly are able to provide multiple services 
(including DSL and video) over infrastructure previously used solely to provide tele-
phone service. This transition to markets in which there is facilities-based competi-
tion  for  voice  and  non-voice  services  calls  into  question  the  need  for  continued  gov-
ernment  funding  at  historical  levels,  and  may  eventually  permit  the  total  elimi-
nation of high-cost support in at least some markets. 

The  continued  growth  in  the  size  of  the  fund,  however,  is  a  matter  of  significant 
concern  to  the  cable  industry  for  a  simple  reason—these  costs  ultimately  are  borne 
by consumers. Based on the anticipated growth of cable telephony services, and the 
corresponding growth in the share of the program that will be funded by cable con-
sumers,  our  industry  supports  efforts  to  reduce  the  burden  of  Federal  support  pro-
grams by more efficiently distributing support. In particular, we believe that reverse 
auctions,  if  structured  properly,  offer  an  opportunity  not  only  to  reduce  the  size  of 
the  fund,  but  also  to  promote  competition  in  high-cost  areas  by  making  support 
available  on  a  more  equitable  basis.  The  challenge  is  to  reduce  the  burden  on  con-
sumers and promote competition, without sacrificing the level of service provided in 
these  areas  today.  We  believe  that  an  auction  program  can  achieve  these  goals  if 
it incorporates the following requirements. 

First,  reverse  auctions  will  only  be  effective  and  technology  neutral  if  they  cover 
relatively  small  service  areas  (such  as  census  block  groups)  rather  than  service 
areas that conform to the boundaries of a particular type of service provider. 

Second,  minimum  levels  of  service  to  be  offered  and  obligations  to  be  met  by  all 
bidders  must  be  established.  This  should  include  some  sort  of  carrier-of-last-resort 
obligation,  which  will  ensure  that  the  fundamental  goal  of  providing  service  to  all 
consumers  is  met.  Any  facilities-based  provider  that  commits  to  meeting  these  re-
quirements should be eligible to participate in the auction. 

Third, bidders should be required to offer services using their own wired or wire-
less connection to the end-user. Such a requirement will provide an important incen-
tive for the construction of competitive networks. 

Fourth,  eligibility  to  participate  in  an  auction  and  receive  the  resulting  support 
should  be  contingent  on  accommodating  requests  for  interconnection.  Incumbent 
carriers  should  not  be  permitted  to  collect  government  funding  for  their  networks, 
while  at  the  same  time  blocking  competitive  entry  and  foreclosing  the  introduction 
of  more  efficient,  innovative  technologies  that  will  provide  the  ultimate  cure  for 
high-cost networks. 

Fifth,  there  should  be  no  guarantee  of  support  such  that  an  incumbent  local  ex-
change carrier or any other provider is ‘‘made whole’’ through a government subsidy 
if  they  receive  less  support  than  they  did  before  the  introduction  of  auctions.  Any 
type  of  guaranteed  support  or  other  guaranteed  revenue  stream  would  completely 
undercut  the  rationale  for  moving  to  an  auctions-based  system,  which  is  to  reduce 
the overall amount of support provided by the program. 

Lastly, for each area subject to auction there should be a fresh look on a periodic 
basis. As technology develops and companies continue to expand their networks, the 
amount  of  support  needed  to  serve  any  particular  geographic  area  should  continue 
to decline to reflect increased efficiencies. 

We also believe it would be a mistake to make broadband services eligible for USF 
distributions in areas that already have a broadband provider. Midcontinent shares 
this  Committee’s  desire  to  ensure  that  all  Americans,  including  those  who  live  in 
rural  communities,  have  access  to  high-speed  Internet  service.  As  I  stated  at  the 
outset,  Midcontinent  has  spent  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  to  upgrade  its  facili-
ties and deploy broadband services in rural communities. We did this without a gov-
ernment  mandate  and  without  a  government  subsidy.  We  did  it  because  we  want 
to  make  certain  that  our  customers  have  the  same  access  to  advanced  digital  tech-
nology  as  all  Americans.  We  took  the  risk  and  invested  private  capital  in  order  to 
provide broadband services in the communities we serve. It is unnecessary and pro-
foundly  unfair  for  the  government  to  subsidize  a  broadband  competitor  to 
Midcontinent  or  any  other  broadband  provider  that  has  already  stepped  up  to  the 
plate and answered the call to help close the digital divide.

We  recognize  that  some  form  of  subsidy  may  be  necessary  to  promote  broadband 
deployment  in  remote  rural  areas  where  no  provider  is  currently  offering  a 
broadband  service  and  it  is  otherwise  uneconomic  to  do  so.  The  cable  industry  has 
offered  support  for  legislation  that  would  offer  loans  or  tax  incentives  to  companies 
that  deploy  broadband  services  in  clearly  defined  and  carefully  targeted  unserved 
areas.  But  the  government  should  take  great  care  not  to  subsidize  broadband  in 
communities  where  companies  are  already  offering  consumers  broadband  service. 
Subsidizing competition is unfair and a waste of scarce resources that should be tar-
geted to areas where a market based solution has not developed. 

However,  despite  our  support  for  government  programs  that  target  funding  to 
unserved areas, we would like to point out that any program that subsidizes private 
entities  to  deploy  broadband  service  is  fraught  with  the  potential  for  abuse.  An  ex-
ample  of  such  a  program,  though  well  intentioned,  is  the  current  Rural  Utilities 
Service  broadband  loan  program.  Loan  money  from  this  program  is  being  used  to 
subsidize  cable  and  phone  competitors  in  markets  where  there  are  already  two  or 
more broadband providers. This type of subsidized competition penalizes private en-
tities  serving  those  markets  and  discourages  private  investment  in  rural  America. 
In its September 30, 2005 report, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture found that the RUS had not maintained its focus on rural com-
munities without preexisting service, questioned whether the government should be 
providing  loans  to  competing  rural  providers  when  many  small  communities  might 
be  hard  pressed  to  support  even  a  single  company,  and  observed  that  the  RUS,  by 
granting  such  loans,  may  be  ‘‘creating  an  uneven  playing  field  for  preexisting  pro-
viders operating without government subsidies.’’ 

While  government  subsidies  may  be  necessary  to  promote  broadband  deployment 
in unserved areas, the cable industry does not believe that Universal Service Funds 
are necessary to spur further broadband deployment. Broadband deployment in this 
country continues to grow at a robust rate, with the number of consumers that have 
signed  up  for  high-speed  Internet  service  in  the  U.S.  far  exceeding  any  other  coun-
try  in  the  world.  The  cable  industry,  for  example,  has  invested  over  $110  billion 
since  1996  in  order  to  provide  high-speed  Internet  access  and  other  advanced  serv-
ices throughout the country. 

As  of  June  30,  2006,  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  reported  that 
based  on  company  data,  cable  modem  service  was  available  to  93  percent  of  house-
holds  that  could  access  cable  TV  service  and  the  phone  companies’  Digital  Sub-
scriber  Line  (DSL)  service  was  available  to  79  percent  of  households  who  could  ac-
cess ILEC telephone service. Kagan Research reported even higher numbers, stating 
that cable broadband service is available to more than 94 percent of all U.S. homes. 
With  private  industry  investing  in  broadband  deployment  like  never  before,  and 
the successful roll out of broadband and other advanced services across the country, 
it does not make sense to undermine the Universal Service program’s principle pur-
pose  of  promoting  the  availability  of  affordable  telecommunications  services  to  all 
regions of the country. 

Turning  to  the  current  USF  contribution  mechanism,  cable  recognizes  that  reli-
ance on the assessment of interstate telecommunications revenues virtually guaran-
tees that the funding base will continue to shrink. An increasing number of compa-
nies  offer  consumers  voice  telephone  service  for  a  fixed  monthly  rate  that  does  not 
differentiate  between  local  or  long  distance  calls.  Companies  also  offer  bundled 
packages of digital services that include voice telephony. Most consumer VoIP serv-
ices  are  offered  without  regard  to  intrastate  or  interstate  distinctions.  The  fact  is 
that  interstate  telecommunications  revenues  have  been  declining  and  are  predicted 
to continue declining for the foreseeable future. As the line between what is a local 
and  long  distance  call  continues  to  blur,  the  existing  USF  contribution  mechanism 
will become increasingly obsolete which threatens the viability of the program itself. 
The cable industry has long advocated the adoption of a telephone numbers-based 
contribution  mechanism,  a  simple  yet  effective  reform  that  will  sustain  the  long- 
term  health  of  this  Fund  while  adapting  to  the  evolving  technology  and  economics 
of voice telephony. Using telephone numbers would be a relatively simple means of 
determining who should contribute as well as when contributions were owed and in 
what amount. There would be no need to apportion provider revenues into interstate 
versus  intrastate  or  to  determine  which  portion  of  a  bundled  offering  represents 
interstate  telecommunications.  It  would  also  make  no  difference  whether  a  service 
was  defined  as  a  telecommunications  service  or  as  an  information  service.  Under  a 
telephone number-based system, all that matters is whether or not the service uses 
a phone number. As such, a numbers-based system promotes competitive neutrality 
among providers and technologies and ensures that no provider of a voice telephone 
service  is  placed  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  due  to  disparate  treatment  with  re-
spect to Universal Service Fund contributions.

While a numbers-based approach would capture any service designed as a replace-
ment for plain old telephone service (POTS), it would avoid assessments on a service 
that  might  include  a  voice  component.  Few  would  argue,  for  example,  that  applica-
tions,  or  devices,  where  voice  functionality  is  ancillary  to  the  actual  purpose  of  the 
service  or  device—such  as  voice  enabled  gaming—should  be  assessed  for  USF  pur-
poses. 

Some have expressed concern that a numbers-based system would collapse as pro-
posals  to  map  telephone  numbers  to  Internet  addresses,  such  as  ENUM,  become  a 
reality.  However,  ENUM  requires  that  a  subscriber  have  an  active  telephone  line. 
If  someday  in  the  distant  future  a  non-number  based  system  were  developed  and 
widely  implemented,  the  telephone  number-based  contribution  mechanism  could 
easily  be  adapted,  as  some  form  of  unique  identifier  or  address  will  always  be  nec-
essary to route various types of voice communications. 

Mr. Chairman, the reality is that interstate telecommunications revenues are de-
clining  and  will  continue  to  decline.  Conversely,  an  FCC  staff  analysis  shows  that 
the  number  of  active  telephone  numbers  is  expected  to  grow  for  the  foreseeable  fu-
ture, from 554 million numbers in use in 2004 to nearly 600 million numbers in use 
in 2007. Moving to a numbers-based USF contribution mechanism embraces this re-
ality  and  will  ensure  the  Universal  Service  Fund  remains  solvent  well  into  the  fu-
ture.  Furthermore,  it  would  create  a  more  predictable  and  equitable  split  between 
assessments collected by providers of local and long distance telephone services, and 
between  residential  and  business  subscribers.  Residential  telephone  subscribers 
would generally pay less under a numbers-based plan. Assuming an appropriate as-
sessment  amount,  even  most  one-line  households  with  low  long  distance  usage 
would  pay  less  under  a  numbers-based  system  than  they  do  under  the  existing 
interstate revenue model. 

As  stated  above,  Midcontinent  and  the  cable  industry  strongly  support  the  goals 
and purposes of the Universal Service program and recognize that changes are nec-
essary  to  ensure  its  continued  viability.  We  appreciate  that  the  legislation  intro-
duced  by  Vice  Chairman  Stevens  (S.  101)  would  give  the  FCC  the  option  of  estab-
lishing  a  numbers-based  assessment  scheme  and  we  would  like  to  work  with  this 
Committee  to  give  priority  to  the  numbers-based  option  and  ensure  that  future  as-
sessments  are  not  extended  to  broadband  and  Internet  services.  The  imposition  of 
new  fees  on  broadband  service  at  the  same  time  policymakers  seek  to  encourage 
more  widespread  deployment  and  service  penetration  would  be  counter-productive 
and  would  raise  the  price  of  high-speed  Internet  services  for  current  and  potential 
broadband  customers.  It  would  also  penalize  those  who  have  worked  diligently  to 
deploy broadband to nearly the entire Nation. 

Contrary  to  assertions  that  broadband  is  negatively  impacting  universal  service, 
the impact has been minimal at best. Most VoIP services, for example, already pay 
into  the  Universal  Service  Fund  and  a  number-based  plan  would,  in  any  case,  cap-
ture these services into the future. The assessment of broadband service is unneces-
sary  to  the  goal  of  a  stable,  sufficient  and  predictable  Fund.  Instead,  a  number- 
based contribution mechanism addresses the current problems with declining inter-
state  revenues  and  bundling  of  services,  and  captures  new  technologies  and  proto-
cols such as VoIP. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Midcontinent  supports  the  goal  of  the  Federal  Government  to  as-
sure  that  all  Americans  have  access  to  telephony  and  broadband  services.  We  have 
invested hundreds of millions to help that goal become a reality. We recognize that 
government  subsidies  may  be  the  only  answer  in  some  high-cost  rural  areas.  How-
ever, any government program designed to promote broadband deployment must be 
technology  and  provider  neutral  and  carefully  defined  and  targeted  to  only  those 
areas that lack broadband service. Furthermore, any such program must be subject 
to the most stringent government oversight to ensure that government funds are al-
located  only  to  areas  that  are  defined  as  unserved  and  are  not  used  to  subsidize 
competition. 

Thank you for inviting me to testify today. I would be happy to answer any ques-

tions you or the members of the Committee may have.

Senator THUNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I guess I would like to direct a question to Mr. Massey at Alltel.

wires.  And  I  guess  I’m  interested  in  knowing  whether  you  agree

with  that  statement.  And  how  should  that  statement  impact  our 
thoughts  about  a  reverse-auction  proposal  that  combines  wireless 
and  wireline  into  the  same  auction?  Would  combining  them  into  a 
single  auction  impact  the  incumbent  wireline  infrastructure  that’s 
already being deployed? 

Mr.  MASSEY.  Senator,  that’s  a  great  question.  And  the  construc-
tion of a network of all of our communications network is very com-
plicated, and I will do my best not to use arcane terms. 

All networks use what is called ‘‘backhaul.’’ Backhaul is the con-
duit  through  which  traffic  that  originates  in  the  last  mile  is  chan-
neled  to  then  go  through  switches  and  so  forth  to  reach  the  other 
side,  the  other  last  mile.  It’s  the  garden  hose  in  the  middle  of  all 
networks.  Yes,  wireless  networks—all  wireless  networks,  to  some 
extent, use backhaul. 

However, I’ll say, we believe we pay, as we say in Arkansas, full 
retail  for  access  to  those  networks.  It  is  one  of  our  highest  ex-
penses,  which  is  access  to  those  wireline  networks  through  which 
traffic  is  routed.  And  I’m  not  aware  that  the  subsidy  affects  that 
pricing by one penny. 

Senator THUNE. Do wireless carriers need the same level of USF 

support as wireline carriers? 

Mr. MASSEY. Do we need the same level? 
Senator THUNE. Yes. I mean, what’s the—— 
Mr. MASSEY. We believe—— 
Senator THUNE. What is the—— 
Mr. MASSEY.—we do, yes. 
Senator  THUNE.  What  are  the  differences  in  how  a  wireless  car-

rier spends those dollars, compared to a wireline carrier? 

Mr.  MASSEY.  I  can  give  you  pretty  good  answers  on  the  wireless 
side.  Part  of  the  problem  on—and  I’m  glad  you  raised  the  actual- 
cost issue, because it’s one of those things that has been in a num-
ber  of  the  filings.  Just  a  couple  of  things  on  that.  And  the  answer 
is,  we  don’t  know.  The  fact  is,  is  that  we  don’t—we  have  a  pretty 
good  handle  on  our  costs.  We’re  a  public  company.  When  we  sub-
mit, for accountability for our USF funds, we give to the FCC, real-
ly  for  the  world  to  know  exactly  where  every  dime  we  spend  goes. 
The  problem  is  that  on  the  wireline  side,  there  is  an  intermediary 
and  a  black  box,  Senator,  and  it’s  very  difficult  for  us  to  tell  what 
their actual costs are. So, it’s very possible, in my opinion, notwith-
standing  some  of  the  thinking  that  may  be  out  there,  that  our  ac-
tual  costs  to  extend  service  to  a  customer  could  be  more  than  the 
actual  cost  of  a  LEC,  of  a  wireline  company,  to  extend  those  costs. 
We just don’t know. And we’ve not, frankly, seen any factual basis 
for any differentiation there. 

The  so-called  ‘‘identical  support’’  rule  is  one  that  compensates 
competitive  carriers  for  essentially  the  underlying  wireline  pro-
vider.  And  one  point  that  I’d  like  to  make  on  that  is—and  if  you 
see  our  written  testimony,  you’ll  see  it  there—that  we’ve  provided 
some  factual  basis  for  that.  Support’s  not  really  identical.  It’s  not 
necessarily  the  same  in  a  particular  market.  So,  we’re  not  nec-
essarily  receiving  the  same  dollars  to  build  the  network  in  a  mar-
ket that the wireline companies are receiving for that market. 

The third thing is, is that we just ask that you’d beware, as you 
consider  this  so-called  ‘‘actual  cost’’  concept,  the  unintended  con-

sequences  of  paying  one  competitor  a  lower  rate  than  paying  an-
other competitor. We think that it’s part and parcel of the so-called 
‘‘competitive  neutrality’’  concept  that  really  has  caused  the  flour-
ishing of both wireline and wireless networks in underserved areas. 
So, that’s what we ask for. 

Senator THUNE. Mr. Crothers, let’s say that a reverse-auction re-
gime  is  put  in  place,  for  USF  funding—and  that  Alltel  wireless 
wins  with  the  lowest  bid  in  your  service  areas.  What  do  you  think 
happens, then, to your service offerings? I mean, do your folks pull 
up stakes? Would they defer new infrastructure investments? What 
happens in that type of a scenario? 

Mr. CROTHERS. Senator, it’s almost impossible to tell. First of all, 
as we go toward this reverse-auction concept I think that it’s going 
to  become  rapidly  apparent  the  fatal  flaws  that  are  involved  with 
it.  We’re  talking  about  different  technologies,  we’re  talking  about 
different  service  territories,  we’re  talking  about  different  tech-
nologies  having  different  capacities.  It’s  almost  impossible  to  ever 
compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges. However, the one 
thing  that  we  can  state  today,  state  yesterday  and  tomorrow,  is 
that  every  one  of  a  local  exchange  company’s  costs  are  approved. 
They  are,  throughout  South  Dakota.  They  are,  throughout  the 
world  of  independent  telephone  industry.  If  one  receives  Universal 
Service funding, they’re done by form and approved by the Federal 
Communications  Commission.  In  the  last  18  months,  there  have 
been  a  tremendous  amount  of  audits,  and  expanded  auditing,  of 
local exchange companies. 

And  so,  I  think  what  you’ll  see  is,  those  are  absolutely  proven 
correct  for  the  wireline  industry.  So,  if,  in  fact,  they  are  correct, 
and  they  are  no  longer  available,  a  number  of  things  are  going  to 
happen.  The  number  one  is,  prices  would  dramatically  have  to  in-
crease. That, of course, would force people off of the network. Num-
ber  two  is  that  companies—in  many  cases,  the  independent  tele-
phone  companies—in  South  Dakota,  virtually  all  locally  owned— 
are no longer going to be able to invest in their networks. 

So,  to  me,  sir—and  I  mentioned  this  at  one  point,  and  I  believe 
it  was  in  the  written  testimony—a  reverse  auction  truly  is  a  race 
to the bottom. The less you invest in your network, the less you in-
vest  in  your  subscribers,  the  less  that  you  will  have,  the  more  im-
pacted  that  the  people  of  America  will  be.  And  it’s  going  to  be 
disproportionally harsh on rural Americans. 

Senator  THUNE.  Just  one  last  question,  if  I  might,  for  Mr.  Sim-

mons. 

Tom,  you  had  suggested  that  this  only  provides  support  for 
broadband deployment in areas that currently don’t have it. Do you 
think there will be viable business models that will take advantage 
of  a  program  that  you’ve  described?  And  would  Midcontinent  par-
ticipate in that sort of a program? 

Mr.  SIMMONS.  In  describing  these  programs  are  you  talking 

about price supports on the broadband side? 

Senator THUNE. Right. 
Mr.  SIMMONS.  Well,  we’ve  advocated  that  any  level  of  support, 
whether  it  be  from  the  Universal  Service  Fund  or  even  from  the 
Agriculture  Department’s  Rural  Utilities  Service  Funds,  that  they 
be allocated to serving unserved areas.

We  believe  that  might  have  been  the  original  intent  of  the  RUS 
program, but we have seen something quite different happen across 
our  service  areas,  where,  in  fact,  those  funds  were  used  to  sub-
sidize  competition  where  service  providers  have  been  providing 
service  for  some  time—not  only  one,  but,  in  some  cases,  two  pro-
viders—while still leaving a lot of areas unserved. 

But,  frankly,  the  areas  unserved  in  our  part  of  the  country  are 
becoming  either  very  remote  or  very  limited.  In  the  state  of  South 
Dakota, for example, there are only two communities with a popu-
lation of more than 200 people that do not have broadband service, 
which I think is quite remarkable. We have a lot of competition in 
the  markets  where  we  provide  broadband  service.  In  the  200  com-
munities where we provide service, we have broadband competitors 
in one-third of those, which is a pretty good number, since we serve 
very small communities. And, again, much to the credit of the rural 
telephone  companies,  they  are,  more  often  than  not,  our  competi-
tors in providing those broadband services. 

So,  again,  I  understand  the  need  for  Universal  Service  support 
for  those  particular  unserved  communities,  but  maybe  not  in  the 
communities  where  they’re  challenging  us  for  subscribers.  There 
may be an area outside of that part of the community that requires 
the  help.  That’s  why  I  was  intrigued  by  Mr.  Landis’  statement,  in 
the  earlier  panel,  about  granular  information,  to  understand  what 
this  is  really  about,  to  clearly  understand  what  is  really  going  on 
in those communities. And I have had the privilege of hearing Mr. 
Landis  testify  at  several  NARUC  meetings  and  certain  seminars, 
where  he  has  greatly  endorsed  the  marketing  approach  to  pro-
viding  services  in  communities.  And,  again,  citing  the  local  cable 
companies  and  local  telephone  companies  that  provide  those  levels 
of service. 

Senator  THUNE.  My  time’s  up,  I  thank  the  panel  for  their  testi-

mony. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Klobuchar? 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
And thank you, to the panel. I used to practice in this area, way 
back,  before  I  was  a  prosecutor.  So,  I  was  actually  thinking  about 
all  the  times  I  had  seen  the  USF  language  cited  in  briefs  and 
things like that. We look back, and looked at it, and it said, in the 
Communications  Act  of  1934,  that  the  fundamental  purpose  of  the 
Fund is to ensure that all the people of the United States have ac-
cess  to,  ‘‘a  rapid,  efficient,  nationwide  and  worldwide  wire  and 
radio communications service with adequate facilities at reasonable 
charges.’’ And so, that’s why I’m so concerned, representing a State 
that  has  a  large  metro  area,  but  also  rural,  about  this  digital  di-
vide.  And,  you  know,  Mr.  Simmons,  you  were  talking  about  the 
communities  in  South  Dakota  that  have  access,  but  the  issue  has 
been acknowledged, is that we don’t really have a tracking to know 
how  many  people  have  it.  The  FCC  tracks  it  by  Zip  Code,  so  one 
person  could  have  it  within  the  zip  code.  But  there  was  a  study—

the  GAO  reported,  in  May  of  2006,  that  broadband  take-up  rates 
were 70 percent higher in suburban and urban homes than in rural 
homes.  And  a  2006  Pew  study  found  a  similar  divide.  And  one 
more  troubling  statistic,  more  than  one  in  ten  rural  counties  don’t 
even  have  a  single  high-speed  Internet  connection  in  the  entire 
county. 

So,  with  that,  I  just  wanted  to  explore  a  little  more  about  how 
we  can  get  to  where  we  want  to  go.  Mr.  Massey,  you  have  stated 
in your testimony that wireless—I heard you say this—is often the 
only  means  of  high-speed  broadband  access  in  rural  areas.  Could 
you  talk  about  the  implications  for  our  national  policy  if  we  were 
to go that way? 

Mr.  MASSEY.  Well,  in  fact,  Senator,  we  bought  a  company,  Mid-
west  Wireless,  that’s  now  a  part  of  Alltel  that  was  headquartered 
in  Mankato,  Minnesota,  the  southern,  more  rural  part,  as  you 
know,  and  they  have  a  vibrant  wireless  broadband  practice.  It  de-
livers  speeds  that  are  close  to  DSL  speeds.  They  were—they  are, 
and  were,  selling  it  very  well.  But,  frankly,  there  are  a  number  of 
markets  in  the—really,  in  the  more  rural  parts  of  southern  Min-
nesota—as  you  know,  a  lot  of  farms,  a  lot  of  distance—and  not  a 
lot  of—and  maybe,  I  guess  you’d  almost  say—there’s  a  lot  of  low- 
income  population.  It’s  not  profitable  for  us.  We  don’t  get  a  return 
for  our  shareholders  to  build  a  fully  deployed  broadband  network 
in  some  of  those  rural  southern  Minnesota  markets.  We’d  love  to 
do  it.  We’d  love  to  serve  those  customers.  With  a  little  help,  we 
could do that. And we think that we could do that as efficiently as 
anybody at the table. 

So,  we  think  wireless  is  not  the—is  not  the  sole  answer  to  the 
broadband  problem.  I  think  it  was—Vice  Chairman  Stevens  was 
talking  about  the  call-center—opportunity  to  return  a  lot  of  call- 
center  jobs  to  rural  America,  let’s  say.  Frankly,  my  guess  is  that 
the technology to really move that sort of traffic will always—well, 
at  least  for  the  foreseeable  future,  be—will  be  some  sort  of  a 
ground-based  technology.  It’ll  be  fiber  of  some  kind.  It  would  be 
very  difficult  and  very  expensive  for  us  to  build  a—and  probably 
the  technology  doesn’t  exist  to  build  that  fat  a  pipe  for  that  sort 
of  service.  But  for  the  people  in  your  markets  and  the  people  in 
South  Dakota  and  Arkansas  and  Tennessee  that  are  agriculture- 
based,  mining-based,  farming-based,  that  want  access  to  rapid 
data—and  where  they  are  in  their  jobs,  not  to  have  to  get  in  the 
pickup and drive all the way back to the house to access the Inter-
net, to order a combine part, but to get it where they are—we think 
wireless  is  the  solution,  and  we  think  it  should  be  a  part  of  any 
broadband solution. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you. 
Mr.  Tauke,  I  understand  that  many  rural  wireless  carriers  that 
Mr.  Massey  was  referring  to  would  like  to  provide  broadband,  but 
they can’t do it effectively unless they get data-roaming agreements 
with larger carriers. I understand that you have a pretty standard 
voice roaming agreement with the smaller carriers. Does your com-
pany  make  it  common  practice  to  enter  into  data-roaming  agree-
ments? And what would you say about a policy of automatic roam-
ing agreements?

116 

Mr.  TAUKE.  Roaming  agreements,  for  both  voice  and  data,  have 
generally been commercial agreements. We try to enter into agree-
ments,  where  we  can,  that  make  sense  in  order  to  have  as  ex-
panded a coverage as feasible for our own customers, because, obvi-
ously, when we enter into a roaming agreement with someone else, 
that  gives  us  the  ability  to  provide  additional  service  to  other  cus-
tomers. 

There  are  not  many  wireless  carriers  in—many  of  the  smaller 
wireless carriers today—who deploy the kind of data capability that 
we do in our network. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  I  mean,  you  also  talked  about  how 
broadband should not be a part of Universal Service, in your view, 
because  the  issue  is  not  affordable  rates,  I  think  you  said,  but,  in-
stead, the one-time capital investment. And I just wondered if some 
of the other panelists could comment on that, and where you stand 
on that. 

Mr. Crothers? 
Mr.  CROTHERS.  Senator,  we  believe  that  broadband  should  be 
part  of  Universal  Service.  It’s  been  demonstrated  over  and  over— 
the  first  panel  emphasized  it—that  it  really  goes  to  the  security 
and the competitiveness and the education of the American people. 
It isn’t a luxury, it isn’t an add-on. And I know the time is getting 
late, but I’ll leave it at that. It’s critical to our very being. 

Dr.  STAIHR.  First,  if  we’re  going  to  support  broadband,  it’s  a 
given  that  the  Fund  would  actually  have  to  increase.  OK?  If  we 
make that decision, we make that decision, and that’s a good thing. 
It  comes  down  to,  do  the  benefits  of  supporting  it  outweigh  the 
costs?  And  we  know  there  are  areas  that,  just  as  they’re  uneco-
nomic  to  serve  for  voice,  they  are  going  to  be  uneconomic  to  serve 
for  broadband  without  some  help,  regardless  of  the  technology. 
Maybe wireline, maybe wireless. As an economist, I think the data 
is  pretty  clear  that  the  benefits  do  outweigh  the  costs.  So,  a  policy 
that  supports  broadband’s  inclusion  as  a  supported  service  makes 
sense. 

Mr. MASSEY. I think you got my answer earlier, but—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Yes. 
Mr.  MASSEY.—just  to  make  sure,  we  believe  it  ought  to  be  part 

of that Universal Service Fund. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. OK. 
Mr. Simmons? 
Mr. SIMMONS. Senator, my comment would be, again, that granu-
lar  component,  and  take  a  look  at  what  it  really  is.  Mr.  Crothers 
said  it’s  not  entertainment.  Yes,  it  is.  IP  video  is  a  major  portion 
of that. Lots of companies will make lots of money by providing al-
most  a  cable  service  over  the  broadband  side  of  all  that.  The  gam-
ing  components,  and  the  time  that  are  spent  with  those  type  of 
things  that  fall  clearly  under  the  entertainment  side,  might  be 
something  quite  different  than  pure  information  flow  or  pure  com-
munications or Voice over Internet telephony. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. So, you would support it for certain compo-

nents of it. 

Mr. SIMMONS. Well, I think it would be important to take a look 
at what is being subsidized and clearly understand what that serv-
ice  is  used  for,  and  if  it  really  does  merit  support.  Or  if  we  have 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00120 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

117 

a case of unintended consequences where, down the road we’re sub-
sidizing  a  service  that  we  shouldn’t,  which  puts  at  risk  someone 
else’s private investment. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And,  you  know,  my  concern  is  just  that 
we’re  shipping  jobs  to  other  countries  that  have  broadband  avail-
able, and then we have small towns in Minnesota, where they don’t 
have  it  available,  where  we  could  add  to  their  employment  if  we 
did. 

Mr. SIMMONS. I’m not—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. And I don’t think of that as videos and en-

tertainment. 

Mr.  SIMMONS.  I’m  not  questioning  the  need  in  those  areas  that 
are  unserved.  I  clearly  think  we  need  to  do  what  we  need  to  do  to 
make  sure  that  broadband  is  deployed  into  those  particular  areas. 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Mr.  Tauke?  That’s  my  last  question,  then. 

Go ahead. 

Mr. TAUKE. Senator, I just wanted to clarify our position. We be-
lieve that we need to ensure that broadband is available to all con-
sumers.  Second,  we  recognize  that  there  are  areas  where  there  is 
no  broadband  today,  and  where  there  is  need  for  assistance  in 
order to provide that broadband. But the question is, Do you want 
a  program  which  provides  ongoing  sustained  funding,  which  is 
what  you  have  with  Universal  Service,  or  do  you  need  a  program 
which  provides  significant  capital—one-time  capital  investment? 
We  think  the  latter  is  what’s  needed  now.  And  so,  you  can’t  look 
to the Universal Service Fund as a solution to that particular prob-
lem. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. All right. Thank you for clarifying that. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Klobuchar follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 
Thank you Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman. I am pleased to be here to ad-
dress  the  challenges  facing  the  Universal  Service  Fund  and  to  work  on  ways  to  re-
form it. 

The  USF  is  not  new  to  me—in  my  years  as  a  telecoms  lawyer  I  dealt  frequently 
with USF issues. And in the past two years, I’ve been all over my home state, Min-
nesota,  talking  about  the  need  to  serve  all  of  our  communities  with  affordable  and 
up-to-date telecommunications services. 

But  I  am  a  newcomer  to  the  more  recent  debates  about  the  best  methods  to  sus-

tain, reform, and fairly allocate the costs of the Fund. 

So I look forward to engaging with all of the stakeholders, with the FCC and the 
Joint  Board,  and  with  my  colleagues,  and  to  asking  a  number  of  important  ques-
tions. They include: 

Should  the  contribution  be  assessed  on  a  ‘‘per  connection’’  basis  or  a  ‘‘per  work-
ing telephone number’’ basis? 
How do ETCs fit into the purposes and operation of the Fund? 
How do we best allocate high cost support for non-rural carriers? 
How do we improve our method of distribution from the Fund? 

Throughout  this  debate,  I  think  it  is  vital  that  we  remember  the  fundamental 
purpose of Universal Service, as stated in the Communications Act of 1934: It is to 
ensure  that  ‘‘all  the  people  of  the  United  States,’’  have  access  to  ‘‘a  rapid,  efficient, 
Nation-wide,  and  worldwide  wire  and  radio  communication  service  with  adequate 
facilities at reasonable charges . . .’’ 

And that brings me to my top priority in this area: bridging the digital divide and 
bringing  high-speed  broadband  to  every  community  in  Minnesota  and  every  corner 
of this country. 

I have talked in previous hearings about the persistent urban-rural digital divide. 
In May 2006, the GAO reported that broadband takeup rates were 70 percent high-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00121 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

118 

er  in  suburban  and  urban  homes  than  in  rural  homes.  A  2006  Pew  study  found  a 
similar divide. 

Here  is  another  troubling  statistic:  more  than  1  in  10  of  the  most  rural  counties 

do not even have a single high-speed Internet connection—in the entire county. 

A community that is left without affordable broadband access is a community that 
will  be  left  behind.  A  2006  MIT  study  found  that  towns  which  had  mass-market 
broadband experienced markedly faster growth in employment and number of busi-
nesses. 

I  am  convinced  that  the  market  alone  will  not  solve  this  problem.  Broadband  de-
ployment will lag behind in rural areas because the private sector gets a much high-
er return in areas of high population density and high income. I am convinced that 
the  Federal  Government  must  assist  underserved  areas—especially  rural  areas—in 
partnership with states, towns, and the private sector. 

That  much  is  clear  to  me.  What  is  a  little  less  clear  is  the  precise  form  Federal 

Government that involvement should take. 

The  FCC  and  the  Joint  Board  have  resisted  adding  broadband  to  the  list  of  cov-
ered  services  under  the  USF.  They  have  consistently  decided  not  to.  I  want  to  ex-
plore  that  decision,  especially  in  light  of  the  fact  that  broadband  meets  one  of  the 
key criteria of the Fund: like plain-old telephone service decades ago, it has become 
‘‘essential to education, public health, and public safety.’’ 

I believe that an updated, reformed Universal Service Fund is very likely the best 
vehicle for bringing broadband to rural America. But I am willing to listen to those 
who  say  that  some  other  vehicle  will  get  us  faster  and  more  effectively  to  our  des-
tination. 

Some have talked about the possibilities of auctions, others about targeted grants 
and loans, others about tax credits. And, of course, any Federal approach must com-
plement  existing  and  emerging  digital  divide  initiatives  being  undertaken  at  the 
state and local level. 

I intend to look at every possible vehicle, with a strong inclination toward adding 
broadband to the USF, and I do not intend to rest until we have met this challenge. 

Thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Senator. 
I’d like to stay here a little longer to continue this discussion, but 
I’m already an hour late. I’m supposed to be on the floor right now. 
But  I’ve  just  instructed  the  staff  to  add,  to  the  in-depth  briefing,

I’m  certain  you  have  noted  that  the  membership  of  this  Com-
mittee  is  heavily  rural.  And,  as  a  result,  I  can  assure  you  that  we 
will  have  some  action  here,  if  not  the  consideration  of  some  meas-
ure  on  the  floor.  But  in  order  to  do  that,  we  will  have  to  take  into 
consideration the concerns and interests of all the parties involved. 
It  will  be  a  challenge,  but  I  can  assure  you  we  will  take  on  that 
challenge. 

And,  in  the  meantime,  we’ll  be  calling  upon  you  for  advice  and 
counsel,  because  this  is  not  the  way  to  do  policy  and  make  deci-
sions. A whole bunch of nonexperts here, we know very little about 
what  is  involved,  but  we  will  have  to  make  the  decisions.  And  so, 
we are counting on you. 

And, for the moment, I’ll be submitting questions for your consid-
eration.  I’d  like  to  get  a  better  understanding  of  reverse  auction, 
for example. I’d like to get your thoughts on that. 

So, with that, thank you very, very much.

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON, U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  holding  this  important  hearing  on  the  present  and 

future of the Universal Service Fund. 

Today, the Universal Service Fund fills a critical role by ensuring that all Ameri-
cans  have  access  to  telecommunications  services  at  affordable  prices.  The  E-Rate 
program,  for  example,  has  ensured  that  almost  all  American  students  have  access 
to  the  Internet.  Similarly,  the  Low-Income  program  provides  affordable  telephone 
service that is truly a ‘‘Lifeline’’ for many families. 

As  we  move  toward  the  future,  I  look  forward  to  exploring  possible  new  uses  of 
Universal  Service  funds,  such  as  targeted  support  to  bridge  the  urban-rural  divide 
in  broadband  service  penetration.  Consumers  in  rural  areas  of  Florida  should  have 
the  same  access  to  broadband  services  that  consumers  in  urban  areas,  such  as 
Miami or Tampa, have available. 

At the same time, however, we must also take steps to preserve the financial sta-
bility  of  the  Universal  Service  Fund.  This  reform  should  start  with  controlling  the 
growth  of  the  Universal  Service  Fund  and,  in  particular,  growth  of  the  High-Cost 
portion of the Fund. 

Unrestrained growth of the High-Cost portion of the Fund is causing an increased 
and substantial burden on consumers that pay into the Fund. Florida, for instance, 
is  currently  the  largest  net  payer  into  the  Fund—last  year  the  State  paid  in  more 
than $311 million more in contributions than it received in distributions. 

We need to move toward a system that shares both the costs and benefits of Uni-

versal Service more equally among all Americans. 

On  the  contribution  side  of  the  Universal  Service  equation,  I  look  forward  to  re-
form  that  is  sustainable,  while  still  protecting  low-volume  and  low-income  con-
sumers from any spike in the amount they currently pay into the Fund. 

And  on  the  distribution  side,  I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  details  of  various  re-
form options—such as reverse auctions—that may limit unsustainable growth of the 
Fund. 

Working together, we can create a Universal Service Fund that is technologically 

flexible, fair to consumers, and sustainable for the future. 

Thank you. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GARY WALLACE, VICE PRESIDENT, 

CORPORATE RELATIONS, ATX GROUP, INC. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Vice  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee,  on  behalf  of  the 
ATX  Group,  Inc.,  thank  you  for  giving  ATX  Group  the  opportunity  to  submit  com-
ments  for  the  record  to  addresses  the  devastating  effects  that  a  ‘‘one  size  fits  all’’ 
numbers-based Universal Service Fund (USF) contribution structure would have on 
consumers with automobiles equipped with integrated in-vehicle emergency commu-
nications systems. 

I applaud the Senate Commerce Committee for specifically recognizing in its 2006 
proposed telecommunications law reforms that the unique circumstances of in-vehi-
cle  emergency  communications  should  be  taken  into  account  in  designing  a  Uni-
versal Service Fund contribution mechanism. 

In-vehicle emergency communications systems which provide automated crash no-
tification, stolen vehicle recovery and mayday signals to trained emergency response 
professionals are often referred to as ‘‘telematics’’ services. These intelligent vehicle 
technologies  enhance  response  to  highway  emergencies.  Every  day  these  services 
save lives, speed emergency response and assist drivers. Systems deployed today on 
several million passenger vehicles provided by ATX, OnStar and others use the cel-
lular  network  with  communications  devices  which  have  individual  telephone  num-
bers. These systems, however, are extremely low volume network users.

ATX  currently  pays  Universal  Service  support  payments  through  its  carrier  sup-
pliers  and  for  telecommunications  services  provided  by  its  call  center.  As  a  matter 
of  principal,  ATX  has  no  objections  to  making  ‘‘equitable’’  contributions  to  the  Uni-
versal  Service  support  system.  The  proposal  to  assess  a  flat  Universal  Service  fee 
on  all  telephone  numbers,  regardless  of  level  of  use  would  have  a  profound,  inequi-
table and burdensome affect on lifesaving telematics services. 

Even at $1.00 per month per phone number, the USF contributions for telematics 
services would approach the cost of the telecommunications services charged by the 
carrier. The fee would violate the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requirement that 
Universal Service contributions be ‘‘equitable and nondiscriminatory.’’ It would also 
be  against  the  public  interest  to  slow  the  broader  rollout  of  telematics  based  safety 
and  security  services  to  the  mass  auto  market.  This  would  be  contrary  to  the  long 
held  transportation  and  public  safety  policies  of  encouraging  drivers  to  adopt  intel-
ligent transportation technologies. 

ATX  provides  core  automotive  telematics  services  to  several  auto  Original  Equip-
ment  Manufacturers  (OEMs).  Core  telematics  services  include  GPS  satellite  loca-
tion-enhanced,  automatic  collision  notification;  a  dedicated  in-vehicle  ‘‘May  Day’’ 
button  to  summon  emergency  assistance;  and  vehicle  theft  recovery.  Neither  ATX 
nor its automotive OEM customers currently offer a personal calling service as part 
of  their  telematics  packages.  The  core  service  allows  a  vehicle  occupant  to  commu-
nicate with a call center to request assistance. 

Additionally, upon deployment of a vehicle’s airbag and/or activation of emergency 
pretensioners in seat belts, a signal is transmitted to the call center, which will re-
spond  to  the  automatic  crash  notification  (ACN).  Whether  by  call  or  ACN  signal,  a 
vehicle’s  transmission  is  only  to  the  ATX  call  center  and  only  the  call  center  may 
place a call to the vehicle. The technology uses the cellular network, with GPS loca-
tion capability, and each activated vehicle is assigned one telephone number. 

An overwhelming number of vehicles have no communication with the call center 
during  a  year.  Of  those  who  do  communicate  with  the  call  center  the  average  call 
is  of  very  short  duration.  The  presence  of  a  phone  number  reflects  neither  network 
use  nor  the  ability  to  communicate  outside  the  call  center  and  vehicle.  A  consumer 
purchases  core  telematics  services  to  summon  assistance  in  an  emergency.  A  ‘‘one 
size  fits  all’’  numbers-based  USF  assessment  will  have  substantial  impact  on  con-
sumer behavior, will encourage arbitrage opportunities between mobile communica-
tions technologies and be damaging to the effort to bring emergency communications 
capabilities to all vehicles. 

In a hypothetical 350,000 telematics equipped vehicle fleet, a $1.00 per month fee 
against  each  telephone  number  results  in  a  USF  contribution  of  $350,000  per 
month. The current USF fee for the same fleet would be approximately $10,000. The 
proposed  USF  assessment  approaches  the  cost  paid  for  the  airtime  and  the  under-
lying services provided by the carrier. Notably, the carrier’s services encompass not 
only  airtime,  but  its  expertise  and  administrative  assistance  in  assigning  numbers, 
arranging  for  toll  free  platforms,  initializing  a  vehicle’s  capability  to  transmit  and 
receive,  maintaining  databases  and  overall  assisting  in  the  delivery  of  emergency 
telematics services. 

The  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  section  254(b)(4),  establishes  the 
standard by which the FCC then may assess a fee to support the Universal Service 
program.  That  standard  requires  that  the  contribution  be  ‘‘equitable  and  non-
discriminatory.’’  A  contribution  mechanism  that  approaches  the  cost  charged  and 
revenue collected by the carrier for its services clearly violates this standard. 

The  courts  have  addressed  the  importance  of  how  the  fee  must  be  fair.  In  Texas 
Office  of  Public  Utility  Counsel  v.  FCC,  183  F.3d  393,  431  (CA  5  1999),  the  Court 
of  Appeals  for  the  Fifth  Circuit  ruled  that  a  Universal  Service  fee  that  exceeded  a 
carrier’s  revenue  violates  the  law’s  equitable  and  nondiscriminatory  standard.  The 
Court  held  that  where  a  carrier  was  assessed  a  fee  in  excess  of  its  interstate  reve-
nues, the underlying premise required of any contribution mechanism was violated. 
There  must  be  fairness  in  the  allocation  of  contribution  duties.  It  characterized  the 
assessment as a ‘‘heavy inequity’’ and that the cost imposed was ‘‘prohibitive.’’ 

The Fifth Circuit addressed the circumstances where a carrier had minimal inter-
state  traffic  and  significant  international  traffic.  The  core  telematics  circumstance 
is even more egregious. Here, with the ability only to communicate between call cen-
ter  and  vehicle,  and  where  most  consumers  make  no  calls,  network  use  is  nominal 
and  confined.  The  fundamental  value  of  telematics  is  the  ability  to  transmit  a  call 
or  signal  to  the  call  center  in  those  infrequent  circumstances  when  emergency  as-
sistance  is  needed.  The  current  USF  contribution  model,  based  on  revenues,  recog-
nizes and accommodates the vast disparity between general consumer use of the cel-
lular network and the minimal use of core telematics equipped vehicles.

A ‘‘one size fits all’’ phone number assessment structure does not comprehend that 
while  automotive  telematics  services  are  assigned  a  large  number  of  phone  num-
bers, the extent and frequency of use of the network is extremely low and confined. 
The  FCC’s  own  decisions  recognize  that  a  contribution  model  must  recognize  and 
accommodate such disparity. See In the Matters of the Federal-State Joint Board on 
Universal  Service  and  Access  Charge  Reform,  15  FCC  Rcd  1679,  FCC  99–290  at 
paragraphs 23–25 (1999). 

A $1.00 monthly fee on each telematics vehicle is inequitable and discriminatory. 
Under this assessment, ATX’s customers would see their monthly USF contributions 
increase  nearly  3,000  percent,  approaching  the  cost  of  the  wireless  service.  Even 
under  the  50  percent  discount  proposed  by  the  cellular  carriers  for  their  ‘‘buckets 
of minutes’’ customers, where several numbers are assigned yet only one bill is ren-
dered,  the  proposed  USF  fee  to  core  telematics  vehicles  is  still  enormous.  Such  an 
assessment will disrupt a market that today is delivering an important public safety 
feature—the  ability  to  locate  expeditiously  and  dispatch  aid  to  individuals  involved 
in  an  in-vehicle  emergency  or  collision—ubiquitously  and  without  limitation  to  the 
technical capabilities of local Public Safety Answering Points. 

If the expansion of location-based automatic crash notification and emergency re-
sponse services are slowed, it will profoundly affect rural areas where these services 
have  the  greatest  impact  on  highway  deaths  and  injuries.  Because  distances  are  so 
great,  the  speed  of  emergency  response  in  a  rural  setting  is  the  difference  between 
life and death as well as recovery and permanent injury. 

In summary, ATX urges the Congress and the Federal Communications Commis-
sion to recognize what the Senate Commerce Committee recognized last year. A ‘‘one 
size fits all’’ numbers based systems is profoundly unfair and inequitable to drivers 
of vehicles equipped with integrated in-vehicle emergency communications systems. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF F.J. POLLAK, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

TRACFONE WIRELESS, INC. 

My  name  is  F.J.  Pollak.  I  am  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  TracFone 
Wireless, Inc. TracFone is headquartered in Miami, Florida. With more than 8 mil-
lion  customers,  TracFone  is  the  Nation’s  leading  provider  of  prepaid  wireless  tele-
communications services and TracFone is also the 6th largest wireless carrier in the 
United States. (The only larger wireless carriers are AT&T/Cingular, Verizon Wire-
less, Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile, and Alltel). Since its inception in 1996, TracFone has 
been able to grow its business to over 8 million customers by focusing on a segment 
of  the  wireless  marketplace  largely  ignored  by  other  wireless  companies.  Specifi-
cally,  TracFone’s  service  is  directed  mainly  to  low  volume,  often  low  income,  con-
sumers  who  normally  make  an  average  of  1  call  a  day.  TracFone  offers  a  ‘‘pay-as- 
you-go’’ service. There are no duration or volume commitments, no early termination 
penalties,  no  advance  deposits;  no  credit  checks.  TracFone’s  customers  pay  only  for 
the  wireless  service  they  need,  when  they  need  it.  For  many  TracFone  customers, 
wireless telephone service would otherwise be unavailable or, if available, would be 
unaffordable.  As  such,  TracFone  thinks  of  itself  as  a  true  Universal  Service  Pro-
vider—and  it  provides  affordable,  easy-to-use  prepaid  wireless  service  without  re-
ceipt of any subsidies from the Universal Service Fund. 

As  a  provider  of  interstate  telecommunications  services,  TracFone  is  required  to 
contribute to the Federal Universal Service Fund (USF). Although TracFone contrib-
utes  to  the  USF  based  on  its  actual  interstate  revenues,  it  has  no  way  to  recover 
its  USF  contribution  costs  from  consumers  in  the  form  of  billed  surcharges.  Unlike 
traditional  providers  of  post-paid  wireline  and  wireless  services,  prepaid  providers 
do not send monthly invoices to their customers and therefore, have no opportunity 
to  add  Federal  Universal  Service  Fund  surcharges  as  line  items  on  customer  bills. 
With no means to recover its USF contributions from its customers, today, TracFone 
contributes  over  $10  million  a  year  into  USF  out  of  its  shareholders’  pockets.  As 
such,  TracFone  is  a  substantial  contributor  to  the  Fund  and  is  a  very  meaningful 
voice in the USF debate. 

TracFone believes that the current USF contribution methodology based on inter-
state  revenues  is  fair  to  all  and  is  consistent  with  the  legal  requirements  of  the 
Communications Act. To the extent that there are concerns about the ability of the 
current, interstate revenues-based system to provide sufficient support for the USF, 
TracFone  believes  that  certain  adjustments  could  significantly  increase  the  level  of 
USF funding. Specifically, there no longer is any need for a wireless safe harbor as 
wireless providers are able to identify which of their usage is interstate. In that re-
gard, TracFone believes that the FCC took an important step in the right direction 
last  June  when  it  increased  the  wireless  safe  harbor  from  28.5  percent  to  37.1  per-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00125 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

cent.  In  addition,  TracFone  supports  the  decision  of  the  FCC  to  subject  Internet- 
based  telephone  calling  services  (often  called  Voice  over  the  Internet  Protocol  or 
‘‘VoIP’’)  to  USF  contribution  requirements.  Also,  the  law  empowers  the  FCC  to  im-
pose  USF  contribution  obligations  on  others  who  provide  services  which  use  inter-
state  telecommunications  including,  for  example,  broadband  Internet  access  serv-
ices.  TracFone  believes  that  the  contribution  base  could  be  expanded  to  include 
those services with no reduction in demand for those services. Inclusion of providers 
of  broadband  Internet  access  services  in  the  USF  funding  mechanism  seems  espe-
cially  appropriate  in  light  of  proposals  which  would  expand  the  USF  to  subsidize 
such services in high-cost areas. 

A  contribution  methodology  based  on  working  telephone  numbers  would  signifi-
cantly  and  unnecessarily  increase  the  costs  of  service  for  low  volume  low  income 
consumers.  Today,  based  on  its  actual  interstate  revenues,  TracFone  remits  to  the 
USF  about  $0.10  per  customer  per  month.  While  this  may  seem  like  a  small 
amount, TracFone’s average revenue per user is only $14.00 per month as compared 
with  the  wireless  industry  average  of  about  $56.00.  Moreover,  TracFone  customers, 
like  most  prepaid  wireless  customers,  make  few  interstate  calls.  Indeed,  many 
TracFone customers make no interstate calls. Therefore, almost all of its customers’ 
$14.00 average revenue is derived from intrastate and local service—services which, 
by law, may not be subject to assessment for the Federal USF. 

If the FCC were to implement a numbers-based contribution methodology and the 
initial  per  number  charge  were  to  be  set  at  $1.20  per  month  (an  amount  projected 
by  a  group  called  the  USF  By  The  Numbers  Coalition  in  a  January  report), 
TracFone’s  monthly  per  customer  USF  contribution  would  increase  from  $0.10  to 
$1.20—more  than  a  1,200  percent  increase,  effectively  creating  almost  a  $100  mil-
lion a year tax increase. Since TracFone’s customer base has grown rapidly—by ap-
proximately 1.8 million customers in 2006, future increases under a numbers-based 
plan would be much greater. As discussed above, TracFone has no means to recover 
USF  contributions  from  its  customers  through  billed  surcharges,  TracFone  would 
have to absorb the entirety of these increases from its operating revenues since rais-
ing its rates is not a viable, competitive option. 

The reason why TracFone and other prepaid providers cannot raise their rates to 
incorporate  their  USF  contribution  costs  is  the  nature  of  the  competitive  market  in 
which telecom services in general, and wireless services in particular, are provided. 
Traditional post-paid providers (those who render bills for services) widely advertise 
the  price  of  their  services  without  reference  to  USF  surcharges  or  other  additions 
to those advertised prices. Such carriers widely advertise services such as 400 min-
utes  for  $39.95,  or  $0.10  per  minute,  etc.  However,  their  bills  sent  in  arrears  are 
for much higher amounts—amounts which include USF and other taxes, surcharges 
and fees imposed by the carriers but not included in their advertised price. Compa-
nies  like  TracFone  compete  with  those  providers.  Unlike  post-paid  providers  who 
can  add  taxes,  fees  and  surcharges,  including  USF  charges,  to  their  advertised 
prices, TracFone and other prepaid providers must include in their advertised prices 
all  taxes,  fees,  and  surcharges,  since  they  have  no  billing  mechanism  to  add  those 
charges  later.  This  creates  a  significant  competitive  disadvantage  since  consumers 
compare  providers’  advertised  prices  with  each  other,  without  realizing  that  some 
providers’ advertised prices do not include taxes, fees and surcharges which will be 
added to their bills, while prepaid providers’ advertised prices are all-inclusive. 

Some  providers  of  prepaid  service—those  who  provide  service  using  their  own 
switches—are  able  to  take  from  their  customers’  prepaid  account  balances  usage 
amounts  equivalent  to  the  amount  of  the  USF  surcharge.  This  method  is  often 
called  the  ‘‘Sufficient  Positive  Balance’’  method  since  the  providers  will  debit  the 
customers’  accounts  only  if  there  are  in  the  accounts  a  sufficient  positive  balance 
to  cover  the  amount  of  the  debit.  Unlike  those  providers,  TracFone  does  not  have 
any  switches  of  its  own.  It  provides  service  by  purchasing  capacity  from  other  pro-
viders. As a result, TracFone customers’ account balances are stored directly in the 
customers’  wireless  phones,  not  in  a  central  switch.  TracFone  does  not  have  real 
time  access  to  its  customers’  phones  or  to  the  prepaid  account  balances  stored  in 
those  phones,  and  it  could  not  debit  those  accounts  to  recover  its  USF  costs  even 
if it wanted to. Accordingly, neither raising rates nor debiting customer accounts to 
recover  USF  costs  are  viable  options  for  providers  like  TracFone.  In  short,  a  num-
bers-based  contribution  plan  would  not  work  for  certain  types  of  telecom  providers, 
including  prepaid  wireless  providers.  Not  only  are  those  companies’  services  not 
billed, those companies do not provide service on a monthly basis. Some consumers 
make  multiple  purchases  of  prepaid  airtime  in  a  month;  other  consumers  may  go 
several months or more without making any airtime purchases. 

Consumer groups have recognized that a numbers-based plan would dramatically 
increase  the  costs  of  the  USF  borne  by  low  income  low  volume  consumers.  That  is 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00126 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

why  a  coalition  of  such  groups  called  the  Keep  USF  Fair  Coalition  as  well  as  the 
National  Association  of  State  Utility  Consumer  Advocates  has  opposed  the  imple-
mentation  of  a  numbers-based  contribution  proposal  at  the  FCC.  In  a  report  re-
leased  February  27,  2006  entitled  ‘‘Exposing  the  Hoax:  The  Phony  ‘Crisis’  of  the 
Universal  Service  Fund,’’  the  Keep  USF  Fair  Coalition  articulated  the  view  that  a 
flat  per-working  telephone  number  tax  would  significantly  increase  the  monthly 
telecommunications  costs  for  low  volume  consumers  and  would  force  many  low  in-
come  consumers  to  drop  their  telephone  service.  The  Coalition  report  also  dem-
onstrated  that  abandonment  of  a  revenues-based  system  in  favor  of  a  numbers  tax 
is  not  necessary,  pointing  out  that  the  contribution  base  has  been  stable  and  that 
available data demonstrate that there will not be a sharp decline in interstate tele-
communications revenues. 

Moreover,  the  potentially  devastating  impact  of  a  regressive  numbers  tax  to  fi-
nance Universal Service is not limited to residential consumers. Many so-called ‘‘en-
terprise’’ customers—users of large quantities of telephone numbers—would also be 
hit hard by a numbers tax. One prominent example of such users is the higher edu-
cation  community.  The  FCC  has  heard  from  numerous  colleges  and  universities, 
large  and  small,  about  how  their  telecom  costs  will  increase  dramatically  if  a  per 
number tax is implemented. For example, Harvard University estimates that its an-
nual  USF  contributions  would  increase  from  $70,000  to  $400,000;  Rice  University 
anticipates monthly increases from $400 to $10,000; Southern Illinois estimates that 
its  annual  USF  fees  would  increase  from  $12,000  to  more  than  $200,000  per  year; 
Calvin College, a small liberal arts college in Michigan, would have its monthly USF 
costs skyrocket from $700 to over $11,000. The list goes on. 

These  institutions  differ  from  each  other  in  many  respects.  However,  the  ability 
of each institution to provide telecommunications services to its students and faculty 
would  be  undermined  by  the  FCC  numbers  tax  proposal.  Several  (including  Har-
vard) even report that their ability to provide E–911 access for their students would 
be jeopardized. Given the high priority which the FCC properly has placed on man-
datory  E–911  access  availability,  it  would  be  a  sad  and  cruel  irony  if  the  FCC’s 
numbers tax had the perverse impact of limiting E–911 access for students residing 
on college campuses throughout the country. 

There  is  another  problem  with  a  numbers  tax.  Typically,  telephone  numbers  are 
provided  as  part  of  local  telecommunications  service.  Many  customers  of  wireline 
and wireless telephone service make few, if any, interstate calls. Yet the FCC’s pro-
posed  monthly  numbers  tax  to  finance  the  Federal  Universal  Service  Fund  would 
be  imposed  on  such  customers  without  regard  to  whether  consumers  derived  any 
interstate usage whatsoever in any given month. Imposition of USF funding obliga-
tions  on  such  consumers  was  not  what  Congress  had  in  mind  in  enacting  Section 
254 of the Communications Act; nor would it be sound public policy to require that 
consumers  who  use  little,  if  any,  interstate  service,  bear  a  large—and  increasing— 
share of underwriting the Federal USF. 

If  the  FCC  adopts  a  numbers  tax  to  fund  universal  service,  it  will  be  necessary 
for  it  to  provide  alternative  contribution  mechanisms  for  certain  types  of  carriers. 
Many  providers  of  interstate  telecommunications  service  do  not  provide  customers 
with working telephone numbers as part of their service offerings. Since the law re-
quires  that  ‘‘every’’  provider  of  interstate  telecommunications  service  must  con-
tribute to the USF, there must be a mechanism appropriate for all carriers. 

TracFone recommends that those interstate telecommunications service providers 
who  are  unable  to  recover  their  USF  contributions  through  billed  charges  to  their 
customers  be  allowed  to  continue  to  have  their  contributions  based  on  their  inter-
state  revenues.  Alternatively,  in  order  to  prevent  pricing  their  services  beyond  the 
reach of the low volume, low income users they serve, TracFone suggests that those 
carriers’  USF  contributions  under  any  methodology  be  capped  at  the  levels  of  their 
contributions under the current revenues-based methodology. 

Finally,  TracFone  reminds  the  Committee  that  another  component  of  the  efforts 
to  ensure  that  USF  contributions  not  unduly  burden  the  provision  of  telecommuni-
cations  services  is  to  demand  that  the  Fund’s  growth  be  limited  and  distribution  of 
USF resources carefully managed. TracFone urges the Committee to continue to en-
courage the FCC to protect against waste, fraud and abuse, and other sources unin-
tended and avoidable growth of the USF. In this regard, TracFone believes that the 
most critical Universal Service issue is the rising size of the Fund and the increas-
ing  burden  being  borne  by  the  Nation’s  telecommunications  consumers  to  support 
that  unrestrained  growth.  The  use  of  reverse  auctions  as  a  means  for  distributing 
USF  high-cost  support  has  the  potential  to  significantly  limit  growth  of  the  fund. 
The  reverse  auctions  proposal  is  currently  before  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on 
Universal  Service  and  a  recommendation  to  the  FCC  is  expected  some  time  this 
spring.  TracFone  encourages  the  Joint  Board  and  the  FCC  to  give  careful  consider-

ation  to  reverse  auctions  and  other  proposals  to  limit  fund  growth  and  to  ensure 
that  USF  resources  are  distributed  in  an  efficient  manner.  Congress  and  the  FCC 
must  enact  and  implement  requirements  and  procedures  which  limit  availability  of 
USF  support  to  those  who  truly  need  the  support  and  which  ensure  that  the  funds 
are  disbursed  in  an  efficient  and  targeted  manner,  with  safeguards  to  prevent 
waste,  fraud  and  abuse.  Implementation  of  such  requirements  and  procedures  will 
ensure that there will be a sufficient USF in the future without the need for disrup-
tive  and  inequitable  numbers  taxes  imposed  on  consumers  and  on  those  enterprise 
customers,  including  colleges  and  universities  and  healthcare  institutions,  which 
utilize large quantities of phone numbers. 

GOLDEN WEST TELECOMMUNICATIONS 

March 8, 2007 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Chairman, 
Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator Inouye: 

On behalf of Golden West Telecommunications, I commend your leadership in the 
Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. I have watched with ad-
miration as you and other members of the Committee work to ensure the long-term 
stability  of  the  Universal  Service  Fund.  While  policy  positions  of  small  and  large 
companies  may  differ  on  this  issue,  we  are  in  agreement  that  accurate,  complete 
and  factual  testimony  is  the  foundation  for  sound  public  policy.  Unfortunately,  we 
do not believe this goal has been met. 

During his testimony on March 1, 2007, Richard Massey, who currently serves as 
Executive  Vice  President,  Corporate  Secretary  and  General  Counsel  of  Alltel  Wire-
less,  testified  about  the  successes  that  Alltel  has  had  across  rural  America.  In  his 
pre-filed testimony Massey stated: 

‘‘For  example,  on  the  Pine  Ridge  Reservation  in  South  Dakota,  the  tribe  esti-
mated  that  less  than  30  percent  of  the  population  had  telephone  service  prior 
to Alltel’s entry into the market as a wireless Universal Service provider. Today 
more  than  80  percent  of  the  population  on  the  Pine  Ridge  Reservation  has  ac-
cess to wireless telephone service.’’ 

In addition, during his oral statement before the Committee, Massey stated: 

‘‘It’s  Pine  Ridge  Reservation,  it’s  included  in  one  of  the  poorest  counties  in  the 
United  States.  When  we  found  this  market  some  years  ago,  it  included  an  in-
cumbent  wireline  provider  that  receives  Universal  Service  funds,  and  yet  only 
20  percent  of  the  population  on  this  reservation  actually  used  telephones.  We 
received competitive ETC money and built the wireless network there and today 
80 percent of that population are wireless consumers.’’ 

The statistics Mr. Massey uses in his statements are simply not correct. Attached 
is information from two government reports, Telephone Subscribership on American 
Indian Reservations and Off-Reservation Trust Lands released by the Federal Com-
munications  Commission  in  May  2003  and  the  Telecommunications  Challenges  to 
Assessing and Improving Telecommunications for Native Americans on Tribal Lands 
released  by  the  U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office  in  January  2006.  The  re-
ports,  both  based  on  the  2000  Census,  provide  the  best  neutral  analysis  of  wireline 
penetration  rates  on  American  Indian  Reservations  and  Off-Reservation  Trust 
Lands.  As  stated,  wireline  penetration  rates  on  the  Pine  Ridge  Reservation  were 
greater  than  75  percent  for  American  Indian  housing  units  by  2000.  This  level  of 
penetration  is  remarkable  when  one  takes  into  account  that  the  two  poorest  coun-
ties in the United States are part of the Pine Ridge Reservation. 

Achieving  this  remarkable  number  was  South  Dakota-based  Golden  West  Tele-
communications,  which  serves  over  48,000  customers  in  South  Dakota  (including 
three  reservations)  with  telephone,  cable,  high-speed  Internet  and  other  advanced 
telecommunication services. 

With  regard  to  Mr.  Massey’s  prc-filed  testimony  and  oral  testimony,  Western 
Wireless,  now  Alltel,  did  not  deploy  wireless  service  until  November  2000  and  did 
not  receive  eligible  telecommunications  carrier  status  until  October  2001.  Given 
this,  it  is  evident  that  Mr.  Massey’s  claim  that  telephone  penetration  rates  on  the 
Pine Ridge Reservation improved from less than 30 percent to more than 80 percent 
penetration  is  clearly  inaccurate.  It  is  not  possible  for  them  to  claim  any  portion  of 
success  given  the  timing  of  their  service  provision  and  the  FCC’s  and  GAO’s  docu-

mentation of wireline penetration rates. Alltel has stated these inaccurate numbers 
in  countless  news  articles  and  more  than  once  in  testimony  before  Congressional 
panels. 

I  respectfully  request  that  this  letter  along  with  its  attachments  be  submitted  to 
the  Committee’s  hearing  record  for  March  1,  2007  to  ensure  that  inaccurate  infor-
mation  does  not  continue  to  be  presented  regarding  this  matter.  We  recognize  the 
need  for  accurate  information  to  reflect  the  reality  of  rural  telecommunications  so 
that  sound  policy  can  secure  the  long-term  success  of  the  rural  telecommunications 
industry and for the Universal Service Fund. Thank you for your time and consider-
ation on this matter. 

Sincerely, 

GEORGE STRANDELL, 

General Manager and CEO, 

Golden West Telecommunications.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

HON. DEBORAH TAYLOR TATE 

Question 1. In 1997, the FCC adopted the principle that its Universal Service poli-
cies  should  be  ‘‘competitively  neutral.’’  In  explaining  this  principle,  the  FCC  con-
cluded  that  ‘‘competitive  neutrality  means  that  Universal  Service  support  mecha-
nisms and rules neither unfairly advantage nor disadvantage one provider over an-
other,  and  neither  unfairly  favor  nor  disfavor  one  technology  over  another.’’  But  it 
seems  that  people  have  different  views  as  to  how  that  principle  should  be  applied, 
particularly  when  it  comes  to  providing  support  for  different  kinds  of  communica-
tions  platforms.  As  members  of  the  Joint  Board,  do  you  believe  that  this  remains 
a  valuable  principle,  and  how  should  it  be  applied  to  competition  both  among  and 
between communications platforms? 

Answer. Competitive neutrality absolutely remains a valid and valuable principle. 
Indeed,  I  believe  that  our  goal  should  be  a  sustainable  Universal  Service  system 
that is, to the greatest extent possible, agnostic to the technology and platform sup-
ported.  Our  current  rules,  however,  set  support  levels  based  on  the  costs  incurred 
by incumbent local exchange carriers (LEC) while allowing all other competitive eli-
gible  telecommunications  carriers  (CETCs)—regardless  of  their  costs—to  receive  an 
equal  amount  of  support  on  a  per  line  basis.  While  this  means  that  all  CETCs  in 
an area receive an equal amount of support per line, only the incumbent LECs’ sup-

port  is  actually  cost  based.  Given  the  incredibly  rapid  growth  of  the  CETC  portion 
of  the  high-cost  fund,  it  is  incumbent  upon  the  Joint  Board  and  the  Commission  to 
consider whether these rules still make sense. Thus, the Joint Board is actively re-
viewing  this  ‘‘equal  support  rule.’’  See  47  C.F.R.  § 54.307.  One  potential  alternative 
to  the  equal  support  rule  would  be  the  use  of  ‘‘reverse  auctions’’  to  establish  the 
number  of  competitors  and  the  level  of  support  in  an  area,  given  a  specific  set  of 
service  criteria.  Reverse  auctions  present  one  way  to  identify  the  appropriate  level 
of ETC support in a market-based and competitively neutral manner. 

Question  2.  Section  254(c)  of  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  defines  Uni-
versal  Service  as  ‘‘an  evolving  level  of  telecommunications  services’’  and  also  sets 
forth criteria that the FCC considers when it decides which services qualify as ‘‘sup-
ported  services’’  eligible  for  Universal  Service  support.  At  present,  it  is  my  under-
standing  that  the  Universal  Service  Fund  does  not  support  broadband  service.  But 
then,  the  question  always  arises—should  it?  And  if  so,  when?  Do  you  think  that 
Universal  Service  should  evolve  to  support  broadband  services,  and  if  so,  what 
would trigger such a determination? 

Answer.  It  is  important  to  note  that,  in  many  instances,  the  Universal  Service 
Fund  (USF)  presently  supports  broadband  services  in  an  indirect  manner.  For  ex-
ample,  carrier  infrastructure  investments  funded  through  the  USF  frequently  can 
be upgraded to provide broadband at considerably reduced levels of expense and ef-
fort. In rural areas, schools and libraries connected to the Internet under the E-Rate 
program  often  serve  as  ‘‘anchor  clients’’  for  advanced  service  providers  that  could 
not otherwise economically provide broadband service to a community. 

That being said, I believe that the USF should, and will, evolve to directly support 
broadband  services.  Section  254(c)  of  the  Act  requires  the  Joint  Board  to  consider 
the  evolving  level  of  telecommunications  services  that  should  be  supported,  ‘‘taking 
into account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and serv-
ices.’’  In  considering  the  evolution  of  supported  services,  the  Act  requires  that  we 
consider  ‘‘the  extent  to  which  such  telecommunications  services—(A)  are  essential 
to education, public health, or public safety; (B) have, through the operation of mar-
ket choices by customers, been subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential 
customers;  (C)  are  being  deployed  in  public  telecommunications  networks  by  tele-
communications  carriers;  and  (D)  are  consistent  with  the  public  interest,  conven-
ience, and necessity.’’ 47 U.S.C. § 254(c). I believe that broadband may now, or soon 
will, meet each of these standards. 

Question 2a. Given that the law defines Universal Service as an evolving level of 
‘‘telecommunications  services’’  and  given  that  the  FCC  has  classified  cable  modem 
and  DSL  services  as  ‘‘information  services,’’  would  the  Congress  need  to  change  the 
statute to make broadband eligible for support? 

Answer.  Section  254(b)  of  the  Act  establishes  access  to  ‘‘advanced  telecommuni-
cations  and  information  services’’  as  a  fundamental  principle  of  universal  service. 
Section  254(c)  of  the  Act  requires  the  Commission  to  take  into  account  ‘‘advances 
in  telecommunications  and  information  technologies  and  services’’  in  defining  the 
services that are supported by USF. The Commission may well, as a result, already 
have  the  authority  it  needs  to  support  advanced  services  that  are  not  classified  as 
‘‘telecommunications  services’’  under  the  Act.  Express  clarification  from  Congress 
would, however, eliminate any doubt. 

Question 3. Currently the wireless eligible telecommunications carriers (ETCs) re-
ceive  Universal  Service  support  on  a  ‘‘per  customer’’  basis  based  on  the  ‘‘per  line’’ 
costs  of  the  wireline  carrier  in  the  same  geographic  area.  This  is  sometimes  called 
the ‘‘identical support rule’’ and ensures that different communications platform pro-
viders  receive  the  same  amount  of  ‘‘per  line’’  support.  One  criticism  of  the  so-called 
‘‘identical  support  rule’’  for  Universal  Service  is  that  it  results  in  overly  generous 
support  to  wireless  carriers  because  levels  of  support  are  not  based  on  the  per  line 
cost of providing wireless services. As a result, I have two questions—— 

First,  do  you  believe  that  Universal  Service  should  support  both  wireline  and 

wireless services in rural America? 

Answer. The Commission’s current rules broadly support voice grade access to the 
public-switched  telephone  network.  Competitors,  including  both  wireline  and  wire-
less  carriers,  bring  a  dazzling  array  of  services  to  the  rural  areas  of  our  country. 
Indeed,  wireless  services  have  added  a  new  dimension  to  connectivity—mobility— 
that  is  very  important  to  many  consumers.  Of  course,  as  the  steward  of  these  con-
sumer-derived  funds,  we  must  ensure  that  our  policies  are  sustainable  and  will 
allow new generations of Americans to have access to the latest generation of serv-
ices  so  that  our  country  is  able  to  compete  in  the  increasingly  global  economy.  The 
key  is  for  consumers  throughout  the  country  have  access  to  such  services  at  just, 
reasonable and affordable rates.

Question 3a. Second, would it be possible to construct a model for wireless carriers 
that  would  calculate  support  based  on  costs  of  wireless  carriers,  and  what  effect 
might that have on the size of the fund? 

Answer. It is my understanding from experts such as David Bodenhamer and Jim 
Stegeman,  each  of  whom  testified  at  the  en  banc,  that  it  would  be  possible  to  de-
velop  a  wireless  cost  model.  Such  a  model  could  provide  some  temporary  reduction 
in outlays from the fund. It is important to note, however, that the per line amount 
of support provided to wireless CETCs is only one factor contributing to the incred-
ible  rate  of  growth  of  the  CETC  portion  of  the  high-cost  fund.  Indeed,  the  fact  that 
we  currently  fund  multiple  networks  in  high-cost  areas—areas  that  require  high- 
cost  support  for  even  a  single  provider  to  serve—also  is  a  major  ingredient  in  the 
rapid growth of the high-cost fund. 

Question  4.  Commissioner  Tate,  it  is  my  understanding  that  there  are  currently 
two  matters  for  decision  pending  before  the  Joint  Board.  One,  referred  by  the  FCC 
in June 2004, examines what the rules should be governing the rural high-cost sup-
port  mechanism.  The  other,  referred  by  the  FCC  in  November  2002,  considers  how 
high-cost,  Universal  Service  support  should  be  calculated  in  competitive  service 
areas.  Could  you  give  the  Committee  a  sense  of  when  the  Joint  Board  might  make 
a  recommendation  to  the  Commission  on  these  issues?  What  steps  must  be  taken 
before any recommendation can be made? 

Answer.  The  Joint  Board  is  poised  to  act  in  the  next  several  weeks  to  make  a 
short-term  recommendation  to  stabilize  the  high-cost  fund  to  the  full  Commission. 
The Joint Board’s recommendation on longer range solutions likely will take several 
months longer. Joint Board recommendations are the product of an ongoing process 
of  negotiation  and  dialogue—a  process  which  currently  is  leading  to  significant  for-
ward progress. 

Question  4a.  Am  I  correct  that  the  FCC  must  act  on  any  recommendation  made 

by the Joint Board within 1 year? 

Answer.  Yes.  Section  254(a)(2)  of  the  Act  states,  ‘‘the  Commission  shall  complete 
any proceeding to implement subsequent recommendations from any Joint Board on 
Universal  Service  within  1  year  after  receiving  such  recommendations.’’  I  hope  we 
will be able to act more quickly. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

HON. DEBORAH TAYLOR TATE 

Question  1.  There  has  been  a  lot  of  talk  about  reforming  the  USF  contribution 
assessment system. Much of this discussion has focused on moving toward a ‘‘num-
bers-based’’  system  that  would  assess  a  per-line  fee  on  all  working  telephone  lines. 
Do  you  believe  that  this  could  be  implemented  in  a  way  that  would  not  harm  low- 
volume and low-income telecommunications consumers? 

Answer. Yes. Proponents of this change advocate that it will, among other things, 
stabilize  revenues,  improve  consumer  understanding  of  the  fees,  and  help  to  opti-
mize use of our limited numbering resources. Others have voiced concerns that mov-
ing  toward  a  numbers-based  contribution  assessment  may  negatively  impact  some 
consumers,  particularly  low-volume  and  low-income  consumers.  While  no  proposal 
is directly before me at this time, I believe that when the Commission does consider 
reforming the USF contribution assessment system, we must carefully evaluate the 
impact of each proposal on consumers. I remain open to ideas that will improve our 
Universal  Service  contribution  policies,  but  will  insist  that  the  solution  we  ulti-
mately adopt be tailored to benefit, rather than burden, consumers. 

Question 2. The concept of reverse auctions has been widely discussed as one solu-
tion  to  the  problem  of  unchecked  High-Cost  Fund  growth.  How  fast  do  you  believe 
a  reverse  auction  program  could  be  implemented?  Why  is  it  better  than  other  ap-
proaches—such  as  study  area  caps  or  disaggregation?  And,  if  implemented,  what 
sort of savings do you think reverse auctions would provide? 

Answer. The amount of time it will take to implement a reverse auction program 
will  depend  on  the  nature  of  the  proposal.  One  proposal  already  in  the  record  sug-
gests  a  phased  in  approach  that  could  take  several  years.  Other  proposals  likely 
could be implemented on a shorter timeline. 

Reverse auctions present one way to identify the appropriate level of ETC support 
in high-cost areas in a market-based and competitively neutral manner. This poten-
tially  is  a  technology  neutral  solution  to  one  of  the  policy  dilemmas  we  currently 
face  with  our  ‘‘equal  support  rule,’’  a  policy  that  sets  support  levels  based  on  the 
costs  incurred  by  incumbent  local  exchange  carriers  while  allowing  all  other  com-
petitive  eligible  telecommunications  carriers—regardless  of  their  costs—to  receive

130 

an  equal  amount  of  support  on  a  per  line  basis.  Reverse  auction  rules  also  could 
result in a reduction in the number of CETCs drawing high-cost support. The Joint 
Board  also  is  considering  other  policy  proposals,  such  as  disaggregation.  The  Joint 
Board  has  not  yet  made  a  decision  regarding  which  proposals  it  will  recommend  to 
the Commission. 

Question  3.  Can  reverse  auctions  be  implemented  in  a  manner  that  is  truly  com-
petitively  and  technologically  neutral?  Wouldn’t  such  a  plan  inevitably  mandate 
technology-based ‘‘winners’’ and ‘‘losers?’’ 

Answer. I believe it is possible to create a reverse auctions system that is competi-
tively  and  technologically  neutral.  Many  commenters  believe  that  this  is  one  of  the 
significant benefits of utilizing reverse auctions. The Joint Board is cognizant of the 
difficult  changes  that  technological  convergence  is  causing  in  the  application  of  our 
Universal Service policies and is working to make policy recommendations that rec-
ognize these marketplace changes in a manner that will promote access to advanced 
telecommunications  and  information  services  at  just,  reasonable  and  affordable 
rates throughout the Nation. Any recommendation made by the Joint Board will be 
made  on  the  basis  of  input  from  industry,  state  regulators,  consumers,  and  other 
stakeholders. 

Question  4.  Do  you  believe  that  the  FCC  currently  has  all  the  authority  it  needs 
to  implement  a  reverse  auction  process?  What  about  authority  to  implement  other 
reforms (such as study area caps or disaggregation)? 

Answer.  Yes—the  Commission’s  authority  to  implement  Universal  Service  pro-
grams is broad. Any distribution mechanism would, however, necessarily have to ad-
here  to  the  principles  set  forth  in  the  Act.  See  47  U.S.C.  § 254(b).  While  this  is  one 
of  the  issues  on  which  the  Joint  Board  sought  public  comment  last  fall,  I  believe 
that the Commission does have the authority necessary to implement a reverse auc-
tions process. The Commission previously has instituted rules permissively allowing 
disaggregation of support areas for certain purposes. See 47 C.F.R. § 54.315. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

HON. DEBORAH TAYLOR TATE 

Question 1. Commissioner Tate, under the current rules in place for the Universal 
Service  high-cost  fund,  can  local  exchange  carriers  obtain  broadband  equipment?  If 
so,  under  what  circumstances  can  they  obtain  broadband  equipment?  Is  there  any 
data regarding the extent to which local exchange carriers are obtaining broadband 
equipment with Universal Service high-cost support funds? 

Answer.  Section  254(e)  of  the  Act  requires  that,  ‘‘[a]  carrier  that  receives  [uni-
versal  service]  support  shall  use  that  support  only  for  the  provision,  maintenance, 
and  upgrading  of  facilities  and  services  for  which  the  support  is  intended.’’  Under 
the  high-cost  fund,  the  Commission  has  permitted  carriers  to  obtain  support  to  be 
used  to  upgrade  loop  facilities  in  a  manner  that  permits  the  carrier  to  offer 
broadband  services  in  addition  to  voice  service.  See  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on 
Universal Service, CC Docket No. 96–45, Fourteenth Report and Order and Twenty- 
Second  Order  on  Reconsideration,  Multi-Association  Group  (MAG)  Plan  for  Regula-
tion of Interstate Services of Non-Price Cap Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and 
Interexchange  Carriers,  CC  Docket  No.  00–256,  Report  and  Order,  16  FCC  Rcd 
11244,  11320–23,  paras.  194–201  (2001)  (Rural  Task  Force  Order).  The  high-cost 
fund  does,  therefore,  indirectly  support  investment  in  broadband  capable  networks. 
Other  than  this  high-cost  loop  support,  I  am  not  aware  of  other  high-cost  support 
mechanisms that directly support the acquisition of broadband equipment. 

Question 2. Commissioner Tate, do you believe that legislative changes to the Uni-
versal Service Fund program should be completed prior to, concurrent with, or sub-
sequent  to  any  Commission  action  on  intercarrier  compensation?  Do  you  see  Uni-
versal Service reform and intercarrier compensation reform as linked or as separate 
issues? 

Answer. While guidance from Congress is always welcome, especially as we work 
through  the  difficult  legal  and  policy  issues  inherent  to  intercarrier  compensation 
reform, I believe that the Commission can take action in this area under the current 
Act. 

Intercarrier compensation reform is linked to Universal Service in some ways. For 
example, the ‘‘Missoula Plan’’ would add significant payment obligations to the Uni-
versal  Service  Fund.  Thus,  while  I  believe  that  the  two  issues  do  not  necessarily 
have  to  be  addressed  simultaneously,  reform  of  both  systems  must  be  complemen-
tary.

Question  3.  Commissioner  Tate,  in  some  rural  parts  of  Washington  State,  there 
are  Wireless  Internet  Service  Providers  (WISP)  that  provide  wireless  phone  service 
and Internet access over the same device. Under the current rules could WISP’s be 
eligible to be an ETC as long as it provides wireless service? 

Answer.  Section  214(e)  requires  common  carriers  seeking  ETC  status  to  be  des-
ignated an ETC by a state commission or the Federal Communications Commission. 
See 47 U.S.C. § 214(e). Wireline and wireless carriers designated as ETCs must offer 
the  telecommunications  services  or  functions  that  are  designated  for  USF  support 
by the Commission in Section 54.101 of its rules. See 47 U.S.C. § 214(e)(1); 47 U.S.C. 
§ 254(c);  47  C.F.R.  § 54.101.  ETCs  also  must  file  certifications  that  all  support  re-
ceived  will  be  used  only  for  the  provision,  maintenance,  and  upgrading  of  facilities 
and  services  for  which  the  support  is  intended.  See  47  U.S.C.  § 254(e);  47  C.F.R. 
§ 54.7. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

HON. MICHAEL J. COPPS 

Question 1. In 1997, the FCC adopted the principle that its Universal Service poli-
cies  should  be  ‘‘competitively  neutral.’’  In  explaining  this  principle,  the  FCC  con-
cluded  that  ‘‘competitive  neutrality  means  that  Universal  Service  support  mecha-
nisms and rules neither unfairly advantage nor disadvantage one provider over an-
other,  and  neither  unfairly  favor  nor  disfavor  one  technology  over  another.’’  But  it 
seems  that  people  have  different  views  as  to  how  that  principle  should  be  applied, 
particularly  when  it  comes  to  providing  support  for  different  kinds  of  communica-
tions  platforms.  As  members  of  the  Joint  Board,  do  you  believe  that  this  remains 
a  valuable  principle,  and  how  should  it  be  applied  to  competition  both  among  and 
between communications platforms? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  competitive  neutrality  remains  a  valuable  principle.  Dif-
ferent  types  of  technologies  can  benefit  consumers  and  universal  service.  However, 
I  believe  we  need  to  take  a  closer  look  at  how  the  system  works  today.  We  should 
take into account the realities of the marketplace, the difficulties in achieving strict 
competitive  neutrality,  and  the  differences  in  technology,  including  their  costs,  to 
ensure  that  we  don’t  unnecessarily  favor  one  technology  or  company  over  another. 
If we do that, I believe that consumers can benefit from multiple technologies while 
the Universal Service system still supports them in a rational manner. 

Question  2.  Section  254(c)  of  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  defines  Uni-
versal  Service  as  ‘‘an  evolving  level  of  telecommunications  services’’  and  also  sets 
forth criteria that the FCC considers when it decides which services qualify as ‘‘sup-
ported  services’’  eligible  for  Universal  Service  support.  At  present,  it  is  my  under-
standing  that  the  Universal  Service  Fund  does  not  support  broadband  service.  But 
then,  the  question  always  arises—should  it?  Do  you  think  that  Universal  Service 
should  evolve  to  support  broadband  services,  and  if  so,  what  would  trigger  such  a 
determination? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  the  time  has  come  to  very  explicitly  include  broadband  as 
part  of  our  Universal  Service  system.  I  believe  a  good  case  can  be  made  that  the 
Commission has statutory authority already to do this, but in light of FCC inaction 
over the years, further guidance from Congress appears needed. 

The Commission is charged with preserving and advancing universal service. That 
means ensuring everyone, from the inner city to the most rural reaches of the coun-
try, has access to the wonders of communications. The challenge we face in meeting 
this great objective is ensuring that our Universal Service mechanisms are sustain-
able.  As  more  of  our  networks  and  communications  migrate  to  broadband  tech-
nology, I believe the key to sustainability lies in modernizing the Universal Service 
system.  That  means  having  broadband  both  contribute  to  and  receive  support  from 
the Universal Service Fund. 

Question 2a. Given that the law defines Universal Service as an evolving level of 
‘‘telecommunications  services’’  and  given  that  the  FCC  has  classified  cable  modem 
and  DSL  services  as  ‘‘information  services,’’  would  the  Congress  need  to  change  the 
statute to make broadband eligible for support? 

Answer.  When  the  Commission  started  down  the  road  of  reclassifying  tele-
communications services I was concerned that the Commission did not take the time 
to think ahead to the possible intended and unintended consequences of our actions. 
One serious source of concern was the real possibility that we would create impedi-
ments to bringing broadband to all of America. Nevertheless, I believe that Congress 
provided  the  Commission  with  the  statutory  authority  to  make  broadband  eligible 
for  support  when  it  told  the  Commission  to  base  its  Universal  Service  policies  on 
‘‘access  to  advanced  telecommunications  and  information  services.’’  It  may  be  the

132 

case, however, that all of my colleagues do not support such a view. For this reason, 
the  Commission  would  benefit  from  additional  Congressional  guidance  in  this  area. 
Question 3. Currently the wireless eligible telecommunications carriers (ETCs) re-
ceive  Universal  Service  support  on  a  ‘‘per  customer’’  basis  based  on  the  ‘‘per  line’’ 
costs  of  the  wireline  carrier  in  the  same  geographic  area.  This  is  sometimes  called 
the ‘‘identical support rule’’ and ensures that different communications platform pro-
viders  receive  the  same  amount  of  ‘‘per  line’’  support.  One  criticism  of  the  so-called 
‘‘identical  support  rule’’  for  Universal  Service  is  that  it  results  in  overly  generous 
support  to  wireless  carriers  because  levels  of  support  are  not  based  on  the  per  line 
cost of providing wireless services. As a result, I have two questions—— 

First,  do  you  believe  that  Universal  Service  should  support  both  wireline  and 

wireless services in rural America? 

Answer.  Yes.  I  believe  that  there  is  a  place  for  wireless  and  wireline  services  in 

our Universal Service system and we should treat them fairly. 

Question 3a. Second, would it be possible to construct a model for wireless carriers 
that  would  calculate  support  based  on  costs  of  wireless  carriers,  and  what  effect 
might that have on the size of the fund? 

Answer. It is clear to me that the costs of investing and maintaining wireless and 
wireline  infrastructure  are  inherently  different.  The  Commission’s  current  rules  for 
determining  wireless  eligible  telecommunications  carriers’  costs  are  both  irrational 
and  costly  as  they  are  based  on  the  wireline  incumbent  carrier’s  costs.  As  I  said  at 
the  hearing,  I  believe  that  one  of  the  things  we  can  do  to  stabilize  the  Universal 
Service Fund is eliminate the Commission’s identical support rule. But to do so, we 
need  to  have  an  alternative  mechanism  for  calculating  support  based  on  wireless 
carriers’  costs.  Calculating  these  costs  based  on  a  model  is  certainly  possible  and 
worth  considering.  At  this  time,  it  is  difficult  to  know  what  the  impact  of  a  model 
approach  will  have  on  the  size  of  the  Fund  because  the  size  of  these  costs  will  be 
based on the model’s mechanics. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

HON. MICHAEL J. COPPS 

Question  1.  There  has  been  a  lot  of  talk  about  reforming  the  USF  contribution 
assessment system. Much of this discussion has focused on moving toward a ‘‘num-
bers-based’’  system  that  would  assess  a  per-line  fee  on  all  working  telephone  lines. 
Do  you  believe  that  this  could  be  implemented  in  a  way  that  would  not  harm  low- 
volume and low-income telecommunications consumers? 

Answer.  My  preference  has  leaned  toward  a  revenue-based  system,  because  it 
makes intuitive sense that those who use the network more, pay more. But the cur-
rent  interstate  revenue-based  system  may  not  be  sustainable.  The  boundaries  be-
tween  local  and  long  distance  are  eroding,  while  new  Internet-based  services  are 
growing. So the Commission may have to consider other approaches like a numbers 
based  approach  to  secure  the  future  of  universal  service.  But  the  way  I  see  it,  the 
devil is in the details. Before supporting any such plan, I would need to understand 
its  impact  on  low-volume  and  low-income  consumers.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  what-
ever methodology we choose, I must be convinced that it benefits consumers. 

Question 2. The concept of reverse auctions has been widely discussed as one solu-
tion  to  the  problem  of  unchecked  High-Cost  Fund  growth.  How  fast  do  you  believe 
a  reverse  auction  program  could  be  implemented?  Why  is  it  better  than  other  ap-
proaches—such  as  study  area  caps  or  disaggregation?  And,  if  implemented,  what 
sort of savings do you think reverse auctions would provide? 

Answer.  I  am  concerned  about  the  impact  of  an  auction-based  Universal  Service 
system  on  rural  areas  in  this  country.  So  are  many  commenters  on  record  at  the 
FCC. Congress charged the Commission with ensuring that consumers in all regions 
of  the  Nation  have  access  to  comparable  services  at  comparable  rates.  It  is  not  yet 
clear  to  me  that  an  auction-based  system  would  ensure  adequate  levels  of  support 
and  meet  this  Congressional  objective.  In  addition,  it  appears  that  it  would  take 
years  before  a  reverse  auction  program  could  be  implemented  on  a  national  basis 
though  it  would  be  shorter  to  implement  a  pilot  program  as  some  have  suggested. 
There  are  many  ideas  other  than  reverse  auctions  that  the  Joint  Board  has  before 
it,  including  study  area  caps  and  disaggregation  that  would  likely  take  a  shorter 
time  to  implement.  Finally,  without  more  detail  on  the  types  of  reverse  auctions  to 
be  implemented  it  is  difficult  to  determine  what,  if  any  savings,  will  be  accom-
plished.

Question  3.  Can  reverse  auctions  be  implemented  in  a  manner  that  is  truly  com-
petitively  and  technologically  neutral?  Wouldn’t  such  a  plan  inevitably  mandate 
technology-based ‘‘winners’’ and ‘‘losers?’’ 

Answer.  There  are  many  different  ways  to  implement  a  reverse  auction.  In  fact, 
both  wireless  carriers  and  wireline  carriers  have  submitted  proposals  on  how  a  re-
verse auction would work. Whether a reverse auction actually met the Commission’s 
policy of competitive neutrality would depend on the details of each proposal. How-
ever,  it  is  not  yet  clear  to  me  that  an  auction-based  system  that  rewards  the  least- 
cost  provider  will  guarantee  comparable  services  at  comparable  rates,  which  is  an-
other  core  principle  of  universal  service.  When  the  Commission  previously  consid-
ered  the  use  of  auctions  in  1997,  it  noted  ‘‘it  is  unlikely  that  there  will  be  competi-
tion in a significant number of rural, insular, or high-cost areas in the near future. 
Consequently,  it  is  unlikely  that  competitive  bidding  mechanisms  would  be  useful 
in  many  areas  in  the  near  future.’’  Before  moving  ahead  here,  it  is  imperative  that 
we understand what has changed since the Commission reached this conclusion. As 
part  of  this  analysis,  we  must  consider  whether  any  such  proposal  would  be  com-
petitively and technology neutral. 

Question  4.  Do  you  believe  that  the  FCC  currently  has  all  the  authority  it  needs 
to  implement  a  reverse  auction  process?  What  about  authority  to  implement  other 
reforms (such as study area caps or disaggregation)? 

Answer.  The  Commission  is  charged  with  the  preservation  and  advancement  of 
Universal  Service  based  on  the  principles  set  forth  in  section  254(b),  including  en-
suring  that  all  Americans  have  quality  services  at  reasonable  rates,  have  access  to 
advanced  telecommunications  and  information  services,  and  have  access  to  com-
parable service at comparable rates. To the extent that Universal Service proposals 
concerning  the  distribution  of  funds,  such  as  reverse  auctions,  study  area  caps  and 
disaggregation,  are  designed  to  comport  with  these  principles,  I  believe  that  the 
Commission has the authority to implement them. However, to the extent that Con-
gress  believes  that  a  particular  mechanism  is  inconsistent  with  these  core  prin-
ciples, we would surely benefit from additional guidance.

HON. MICHAEL J. COPPS 

Question  1.  Commissioner  Copps,  under  the  current  rules  in  place  for  the  Uni-
versal  Service  high-cost  fund,  can  local  exchange  carriers  obtain  broadband  equip-
ment?  If  so,  under  what  circumstances  can  they  obtain  broadband  equipment?  Is 
there  any  data  regarding  the  extent  to  which  local  exchange  carriers  are  obtaining 
broadband equipment with Universal Service high-cost support fund? 

Answer.  The  High  Cost  program  is  already  indirectly  subsidizing  broadband.  In-
vestments  in  telephone  networks  subsidized  by  the  program  end  up  subsidizing 
broadband because most telephone equipment is capable of providing voice and data 
services.  Also,  the  Department  of  Agriculture’s  Rural  Utilities  Service  makes  low- 
interest  loans  to  companies  that  invest  in  telephone  networks  capable  of  providing 
broadband  as  well  as  voice  telephone  service.  Many  of  those  loans  were  made  for 
equipment  that  subsequently  formed  part  of  the  cost  basis  for  USF  support.  I  am 
not  aware  of  data  regarding  how  much  high-cost  support  is  used  to  support 
broadband. 

Question  2.  Commissioner  Copps,  do  you  believe  that  legislative  changes  to  the 
Universal  Service  Fund  program  should  be  completed  prior  to,  concurrent  with,  or 
subsequent to any Commission action on intercarrier compensation? Do you see Uni-
versal Service reform and intercarrier compensation reform as linked or as separate 
issues? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  that  one  thing  that  could  be  done  to  stabilize  the  Fund  is 
to  adjust  the  contribution  rules  to  ensure  that  it  is  funded  by  intrastate  and  inter-
state  revenues.  With  the  boundaries  between  local  and  long  distance  eroding,  and 
the  growth  of  any-distance  calling  plans,  assessing  only  on  interstate  services  is 
growing  more  difficult  over  time.  However,  such  a  change  would  require  action  by 
Congress. There does not appear to be a magic formula as to the timing of changes 
to Universal Service and intercarrier compensation. However, any changes we make 
to one program could require offsetting changes in the other. Thus any action must 
be done in a comprehensive way. 

Question  3.  Commissioner  Copps,  in  some  rural  parts  of  Washington  State,  there 
are  Wireless  Internet  Service  Providers  (WISP)  that  provide  wireless  phone  service 
and Internet access over the same device. Under the current rules could WISP’s be 
eligible to be an ETC as long as it provides wireless service?

Answer.  The  states  have  primary  responsibility  for  designating  telecommuni-
cations  carriers  as  eligible  telecommunications  carriers  (ETCs).  It  is  my  under-
standing that the FCC has not considered any carrier applications from Washington 
State for designation as an ETC. In the case of Washington State, the Utilities and 
Transportation  Commission  has  the  authority  and  has  approved  such  applications. 
Therefore,  whether  a  wireless  Internet  service  provider  is  eligible  for  ETC  status 
under Washington State’s rules is a decision for the state commission to determine. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

LARRY S. LANDIS 

Question 1. In 1997, the FCC adopted the principle that its Universal Service poli-
cies  should  be  ‘‘competitively  neutral.’’  In  explaining  this  principle,  the  FCC  con-
cluded  that  ‘‘competitive  neutrality  means  that  Universal  Service  support  mecha-
nisms and rules neither unfairly advantage nor disadvantage one provider over an-
other,  and  neither  unfairly  favor  nor  disfavor  one  technology  over  another.’’  But  it 
seems  that  people  have  different  views  as  to  how  that  principle  should  be  applied, 
particularly  when  it  comes  to  providing  support  for  different  kinds  of  communica-
tions  platforms.  As  members  of  the  Joint  Board,  do  you  believe  that  this  remains 
a  valuable  principle,  and  how  should  it  be  applied  to  competition  both  among  and 
between communications platforms? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  ‘‘competitive  neutrality’’  is  a  key  concept,  but  so  is  seeing 
that  Universal  Service  funds  are  appropriately  deployed,  that  legitimate  needs  are 
met,  and  that  accountability,  efficiency,  and  performance  are  demanded.  The  focus 
should  be  on  the  service  provided  to  consumers  not  necessarily  the  companies  or 
technologies providing the service. 

Seeking  to  establish  a  ‘‘competitively  neutral’’  regime  is  an  important  principle, 
but  its  application  must  be  tempered  by  the  specific  legal  requirements  contained 
in  47  U.S.C.  § 254(b)(3)  and  (b)(5)  respectively.  When  it  emerged,  competitive  neu-
trality seemed like it should be a driving focus and the only logical choice for policy-
makers.  Logically  enough,  the  issue  has  become  achieving  a  competitively  neutral 
definition  of  ‘‘competitive  neutrality.’’  Shifts  in  the  market,  including  the  pace  of 
changes occurring in technology, corporate consolidation, and corporate realignment 
have  been  so  great  that  this  goal  has  become  troublesome  to  operationalize  with 
specific policy reforms. 

In designing a next-generation policy, we need to take some time not only to listen 
to  the  lawyers  but  also  to  the  marketers,  since  the  former  are  paid  to  be  ‘‘close’’  to 
policymakers whereas marketers are paid to be ‘‘close’’ to the market. 

The  wireless  industry  has  spoken  justifiably,  aggressively  and  articulately  about 
the  achievements  which  have  been  made  possible  in  an  environment  where  there 
is a light regulatory touch. And they have also pointed to those customers who have 
‘‘cut the cord’’ as evidence of wireless’ success story. 

The  reality  however,  is  that  the  market  still  has  significantly  different  expecta-
tions of the existing wireline and wireless technologies. The overwhelming majority 
of  customers  have  and  use  both  technologies,  but  use  them  differently.  Moreover, 
customer  expectations  of  wireless,  while  rising  steadily,  are  still  not  ‘‘competitively 
neutral’’,  if,  for  example,  by  competitive  neutrality  you  mean  ‘‘number  of  dropped 
calls,’’ or other measures of quality of service. 

A  leading  national  wireless  company  has  made  ‘‘fewest  dropped  calls’’  the  key-
stone of its marketing element, because that claim is meaningful to a large segment 
of the wireless market. No wireline company would make such a claim because such 
a claim would not be relevant to either the experience or the expectations of its cus-
tomers.  For  equally  obvious  reasons,  wireline  companies  choose  not  to  compete  in 
the ‘‘mobile convenience’’ segment of the market. 

Market-based  issues  aside,  the  requirements  of  reasonably  comparable  rates  and 
services  as  well  as  the  pursuit  of  affordable  rates  and  services  are  among  the  pri-
mary  foci  and  drivers  of  our  policies.  Many  predict  we  are  moving  toward  the  day 
when there will be one converged, efficient network capable of provisioning multiple 
layers  of  applications  and  services.  Many  companies  have  moved  their  business 
models to this notion and means of operation, and to its companion marketing pro-
posal  . . .  the  ‘‘triple’’  or  the  ‘‘quadruple  play,’’  with  emphasis  on  expanding  the 
share of total communications wallet and driving both consolidation and partnering. 
Question  2.  Section  254(c)  of  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  defines  Uni-
versal  Service  as  ‘‘an  evolving  level  of  telecommunications  services’’  and  also  sets 
forth criteria that the FCC considers when it decides which services qualify as ‘‘sup-
ported  services’’  eligible  for  Universal  Service  support.  At  present,  it  is  my  under-
standing  that  the  Universal  Service  Fund  does  not  support  broadband  service.  But

then,  the  question  always  arises—should  it?  And  if  so,  when?  Do  you  think  that 
Universal  Service  should  evolve  to  support  broadband  services,  and  if  so,  what 
would trigger such a determination? 

Question 2a. Given that the law defines Universal Service as an evolving level of 
‘‘telecommunications  services’’  and  given  that  the  FCC  has  classified  cable  modem 
and DSL services as ‘‘information services,’’ would the Congress need to change the 
statute to make broadband eligible for support? 

Answer. As indicated by my colleagues in the March 1 hearing, there are specific 
criteria  set  forth  under  47  U.S.C.  § 254(c)  which  direct  the  Joint  Board  to  rec-
ommend to the FCC, and for the FCC to establish, a definition of the telecommuni-
cations services which should be supported by Universal Service mechanisms. 

Section  254(c)  states  that  when  adopting  this  list  of  telecommunications  services, 
the  Joint  Board  and  Commission  ‘‘shall  consider’’  whether  the  service  is:  (1)  essen-
tial  to  education,  public  health,  or  public  safety;  (2)  subscribed  to  by  a  substantial 
majority of residential consumers; (3) being deployed by telecommunications carriers 
in  public  telecommunications  networks;  and  (4)  consistent  with  the  public  interest, 
convenience and necessity. 

The  Commission  has  concluded  that  each  of  these  criteria  must  be  considered, 
‘‘but each not necessarily met’’, before a service may be included within the general 
definition of universal service, should it be in the public interest. 

In July of 2003, the FCC released its Definitions Order under CC Docket No. 96– 
45,  upon  which  the  Joint  Board  had  made  its  recommendations.  A  part  of  that 
Order  was  the  consideration  of  advanced  or  high-speed  services.  The  Commission 
stated  that  it  declined  to  expand  the  definition  of  supported  services  to  include  ad-
vanced or high-speed services at that time. 

Although the Commission agreed with certain of those who filed comments in that 
proceeding  that  broadband  services  were  becoming  increasingly  important  for  con-
sumers  in  all  regions  of  the  Nation,  they  also  agreed  with  the  Joint  Board  and  the 
majority  of  commenters  that  high-speed  and  advanced  services  currently  [i.e.,  as  of 
2003]  did  not  meet  the  Act’s  criteria  for  inclusion  on  the  list  of  supported  services. 
Furthermore,  the  Commission  went  on  to  say  that  although  telecommunications 
carriers  increasingly  were  deploying  infrastructure  capable  of  providing  advanced 
and  high-speed  services,  the  Commission  agreed  with  the  Joint  Board  and  com-
menters  that  advanced  services  were  not  subscribed  to  by  a  substantial  majority  of 
residential consumers. In fact, the Commission’s own data showed that as of Decem-
ber  31,  2002,  there  were  approximately  17.4  million  high-speed  lines  serving  resi-
dential and small business subscribers, which represented just 16 percent of all U.S. 
households. 

It  is  evident  that  broadband  services  are  becoming  increasingly  pervasive  and 
moving in the direction of the ‘‘substantial majority’’ test, and it is also evident that 
independent  of  the  criteria  set  up  in  47  U.S.C.  § 254(c),  there  is  strong  anecdotal 
evidence to support the need for pervasive buildout. 

It would be prudent for the FCC to refer this matter to the Joint Board for further 

consideration, given that we may soon fulfill the ‘‘substantial majority’’ criterion. 

The  threshold  legal  question  of  whether  or  not  advanced  services,  as  they  relate 
to  cable  modems,  DSL  and  other  similarly  situated  services,  would  have  to  be  re-
classified  from  information  services  to  telecommunications  services  for  purposes  of 
USF  support  presents  a  potential  legal  quagmire  for  the  FCC  and  the  Joint  Board. 
Such  reclassification  could  potentially  reopen  the  door  to  litigation  over  jurisdic-
tional and related issues which had been largely resolved. 

It  would  seem  to  be  less  troublesome  for  Congress  to  pass  a  narrowly  focused 
amendment  to  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  allowing  broadband  services  to 
be supported, thereby investing the policy decision with statutory authority. 

If a decision is made to move toward support of broadband services either through 
the  FCC  or  through  Congress,  it  also  becomes  important  to  consider  whether 
broadband  support  should  take  the  same  general  form  as  has  High  Cost  support, 
or  whether  that  support  should  concentrate  primarily  or  exclusively  on  the  cost  of 
buildout. I believe the latter approach is preferable, and clearly more affordable. 

The  first  question  is  whether  and  to  what  extent  High  Cost  support  is  currently 
advantaging  the  use  of  a  second  line  for  Internet  access  via  dial-up,  as  opposed  to 
a  single-line  solution  which  rolls  up  POTS  (or  its  VoIP  surrogate)  together  with 
high-speed  access.  An  artificially  depressed  ‘‘take  rate’’  created  perversely  through 
a  legacy  technology  subsidy  could  significantly  impact  the  business  plans  of  those 
providers which are weighing broadband buildout and deciding where it is economi-
cal to implement it. 

For  other  areas,  implementation  of  a  second  tier  incentive  in  the  form  of  specific 
tax breaks could prove sufficient to assure build out where the business model sug-
gests that a positive return without incentives is unlikely or improbable.

Finally,  the  Wyoming  and  Kentucky  studies  suggest  there  are  remote  areas  (per-
haps as few as 2–5 percent of total customers) where the cost of building out a sin-
gle  loop  or  equivalent  may  run  as  high  as  $10,000  or  more,  depending  on  cir-
cumstances  and  the  technology  involved.  In  such  instances,  a  straight  subsidy  of 
some sort is clearly required to produce the desired ubiquitous buildout. 

However,  the  Wyoming  study  has  also  shown  that  significant  intermodal  distinc-
tions exist among technologies. In that case, any provider (regardless of technology) 
should be allowed to bid for the opportunity to build out to those ‘‘highest cost’’ cus-
tomers, with the subsidy being awarded to the lowest bidder, but in no case should 
a subsidy greater than the cost of the lowest price technology be granted. 

Hypothetically, if the cost of buildout to a specific customer is projected at $2,500 
for  cable,  $3,700  for  wireless  and  $10,000  for  a  wireline  provider,  any  provider 
should be able to bid to serve that customer . . . but in no case should the winning 
bidder receive more than the $2,500 representing the lowest cost provider. 

Question 3. Currently the wireless eligible telecommunications carriers (ETCs) re-
ceive  Universal  Service  support  on  a  ‘‘per  customer’’  basis  based  on  the  ‘‘per  line’’ 
costs  of  the  wireline  carrier  in  the  same  geographic  area.  This  is  sometimes  called 
the ‘‘identical support rule’’ and ensures that different communications platform pro-
viders  receive  the  same  amount  of  ‘‘per  line’’  support.  One  criticism  of  the  so-called 
‘‘identical  support  rule’’  for  Universal  Service  is  that  it  results  in  overly  generous 
support  to  wireless  carriers  because  levels  of  support  are  not  based  on  the  per  line 
cost of providing wireless services. As a result, I have two questions—— 

First,  do  you  believe  that  Universal  Service  should  support  both  wireline  and 

wireless services in rural America? 

Second, would it be possible to construct a model for wireless carriers that would 
calculate  support  based  on  costs  of  wireless  carriers,  and  what  effect  might  that 
have on the size of the fund? 

Answer.  Yes,  I  believe  that  in  truly  high-cost  rural  areas,  there  is  room  both  in 
terms of public policy and funding to support both wireline and wireless services in 
rural  America.  However,  I  have  great  difficulty  accepting  the  notion  that  it  is  nec-
essary  for  multiple  wireless  companies  to  receive  what  amount  to  multiple  govern-
ment  subsidies  in  the  process  of  bringing  both  wireless  and  wireline  services  to 
‘‘truly rural’’ areas. 

In  many  if  not  most  cases,  the  cities,  towns  and  villages  where  the  wireline  pro-
viders locate their central offices and wire centers, are contestable. It is not unusual 
in relatively small communities to find a wireline, wireless and cable provider com-
peting for customers in those core areas. 

I  believe  that  the  current  system  of  equal  support,  while  well-intentioned,  does 
little to achieve competitive neutrality. The identical support rule demonstrates the 
unintended  consequences  which  are  produced  when  a  strong  desire  to  achieve  com-
petitive neutrality doesn’t take into account differing cost structures. 

Many  in  the  industry  readily  admit  in  moments  of  candor  that  the  identical  sup-
port  rule  has  become,  in  many  instances,  a  means  to  game  the  system.  Given  the 
current  circumstances,  State  Commissions  need  to  be  more  vigilant  in  their  review 
and  approval  process  for  CETC  applicants,  e.g.,  undertaking  the  sort  of  assessment 
which the FCC contemplated in its 2005 ETC Order.1 

Under  the  current  structure,  as  CETCs,  wireless  carriers  receive  the  same  per- 
line  support  as  their  wireline  counterparts  while  in  most  cases  their  cost  structure 
is significantly less than that of the incumbent wireline carrier. 

Also,  as  noted  in  Q.  1,  carriers  operate  under  a  separate  set  of  both  policy  and 
service  expectations.  How  can  anyone  realistically  argue  that  wireline  and  wireless 
companies are being treated in a competitively neutral manner when many wireless 
companies and advocates admit privately that their costs are, in many cases, signifi-
cantly lower that those of the ILECs? 

At the same time, RLEC recipients of High Cost Line Support continue to receive 
funding  based  on  legacy  investment  and  business  decisions  which  may  have  been 
made decades ago. It is arguable that this produces business decisions which resem-
ble  those  of  the  Big  3  auto  makers,  with  their  legacy  cost  structure  and  legacy  in-
vestments. 

It is largely because of this identical support that we have seen first-hand the size 

of the Fund grow exponentially over the last several years. 

On  an  interim  basis,  as  a  preliminary  threshold  matter,  I  believe  that  CETCs 
should receive support based on their own costs, not those of the incumbent wireline 
carrier.

I  believe  that  a  model  could  be  constructed  to  capture  a  wireless  carrier’s  costs 
as  long  as  the  relevant  agency  accounts  for  the  type  of  territory  that  will  be 
served—determining,  e.g.,  is  it  rural  or  urban,  what  type  of  terrain  is  it  encom-
passing,  farm  land  or  mountainous?  These  types  of  considerations  can  be  built  into 
a  model  in  a  much  more  efficient  manner  today  than  they  were  in  previous 
iterations of the current high-cost model. 

As long as the companies seeking funding understand that they must justify that 
funding  with  a  cost  analysis  or  model,  I  believe  there  is  a  strong  incentive—cur-
rently at $1 billion and doubling each year in recent years—to provide such cost jus-
tification. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

LARRY S. LANDIS 

Question  1.  There  has  been  a  lot  of  talk  about  reforming  the  USF  contribution 
assessment system. Much of this discussion has focused on moving toward a ‘‘num-
bers-based’’  system  that  would  assess  a  per-line  fee  on  all  working  telephone  lines. 
Do  you  believe  that  this  could  be  implemented  in  a  way  that  would  not  harm  low- 
volume and low-income telecommunications consumers? 

Answer.  Yes.  I  believe  using  a  numbers-based  methodology  could  be  useful  and 
not  harmful  to  low-volume  or  low-income  consumers  as  long  as  the  contributions 
base  is  expanded  to  include  wireless  carriers,  VoIP  providers,  and  voice-grade 
equivalents  to  capture  special  access  and  private  lines,  particularly  for  businesses. 
The  key  to  avoiding  an  undue  burden  for  any  segment  of  the  population  is  to 
spread  the  responsibility  across  all  segments  so  that  no  one  segment  (i.e.,  low  in-
come users) is unduly burdened. 

Currently,  everyone  who  is  connected  to  the  system  is  receiving  full  value  from 
the  system  regardless  of  the  price  paid;  if  that  were  not  the  case,  they  would  dis-
connect  from  the  system.  So  we  should  not  necessarily  assume  that  just  because 
someone  does  not  make  a  high  volume  of  calls,  that  person  is  being  harmed  by  the 
price  per  call  paid.  That  person  may  place  a  higher  value  on  each  call,  or  simply 
on the ability to access the network at will, than does the higher volume user. 

In  the  event  Congress  should  determine  that  additional  steps  should  be  taken  to 
avoid burdening low-income consumers, there are multiple options available, includ-
ing increasing Lifeline support or indexing to income level, but such a move should 
be  based  on  appropriate  and  totally  objective  3rd  party  data  to  make  certain  the 
focus is squarely on the target population. 

Question 2. The concept of reverse auctions has been widely discussed as one solu-
tion  to  the  problem  of  unchecked  High-Cost  Fund  growth.  How  fast  do  you  believe 
a  reverse  auction  program  could  be  implemented?  Why  is  it  better  than  other  ap-
proaches—such  as  study  area  caps  or  disaggregation?  And,  if  implemented,  what 
sort of savings do you think reverse auctions would provide? 

Answer. I believe that if implemented nationwide, a reverse auction system could 
be functional within two to 3 years. I would personally prefer an approach in which 
reverse  auctions  were  first  tested,  perhaps  as  a  means  of  identifying  providers  in 
unserved  areas  or  of  selecting  a  ‘‘winner’’  or  ‘‘winners’’  (depending  on  the  model 
adopted)  in  a  representative  group  of  states,  before  being  implemented  nationally. 
Many key questions must be addressed, as I’m sure the members of the Committee 
are well aware. 

Every  aspect  of  the  design  of  a  reverse  auction  needs  to  be  carefully  considered, 
especially including who ‘‘wins,’’ which is directly related to the question of whether 
the  design  is  to  be  ‘‘winner’’  takes  all,  ‘‘winner’’  takes  more  [as  proposed  in  at  least 
one  wireless  CETC  auction  model  in  response  to  the  Request  for  Comment],  or 
whether there is one ‘‘winner’’ for each sector—i.e., wireline and wireless. 

If the design which is ultimately selected were to be ‘‘one winner takes all,’’ there 
are  numerous  issues  to  be  resolved  in  the  event  the  incumbent  local  exchange 
(wireline)  carrier  is  not  successful  in  the  auction  process,  including  what  happens 
to  that  incumbent’s  network  and  overall  presence  in  the  market  if  the  wireline  in-
cumbent is unsuccessful and does not ‘‘win’’ the auction. 

Since  most  wireless  providers  are  still  dependent  on  wireline  incumbents’  net-
works  for  transport,  the  question  of  what  constitutes  fair  compensation  for  contin-
ued  use  of  portions  of  the  network  of  a  ‘‘losing’’  incumbent  by  a  ‘‘winning’’  CETC 
is a critical issue. 

Further,  we  also  need  to  be  prepared  to  offer  a  transition  mechanism  for  incum-
bents  that  might  ‘‘lose’’  in  an  auction  setting,  since  their  business  plans  are  pre-
mised  on  the  current  USF  disbursement  system  rather  than  on  a  significantly  dif-
ferent mechanism.

In  our  current  proceeding  we  are  examining  how,  on  a  broad  basis,  we  deal  with 
the  possibility  of  partial  or  full  re-monopolization  of  the  marketplace  in  certain  re-
gions.  This  threshold  policy  question  is  important  because  some  rural  and  insular 
areas  of  the  United  States  may  not  be  able  to  support  more  than  one  carrier,  yet 
under  the  current  USF  structure,  multiple  carriers  are  funded.  This  is  a  political 
and economic reality, yet we are very mindful that this system cannot be unwound 
overnight,  assuming  a  consensus  emerges  that  implementation  of  a  reverse  auction 
approach is a worthy goal. 

That  is  why  the  answers  are  dependent  upon  the  implementation  rules—i.e.,  the 
design and structure of the auction[s] if such an approach were to be adopted—and 
without such details being addressed, it is almost impossible to quantify and assess 
what possible savings or costs would be produced. 

Interim  measures,  including  a  cap  on  funding,  are  essential  in  order  to  stem  the 
accelerating growth spiral of the Fund in the short term. As my colleague Billy Jack 
Gregg said in response to a question at the March 1 hearing, that interim cap must 
be applied where the problem exists . . . where the growth is occurring. Like Willie 
Sutton in Director Gregg’s response, we need to go ‘‘where the money is,’’ and apply 
the temporary cap there. 

Put another way, an EMT responding to a serious accident does not apply a tour-
niquet  to  a  victim’s  leg  if  that  accident  victim  is  hemorrhaging  from  the  arm.  And 
this analogy is appropriate in more ways than one, because a proposed interim cap, 
like  a  tourniquet,  is  only  intended  to  be  a  temporary  measure  to  address  an  acute 
need until the patient can be fully triaged and comprehensively treated. 

This  step  would  allow  the  Joint  Board  sufficient  time  to  address  longer-term 
issues  without  leaving  the  Fund  in  jeopardy  of  implosion  because  it  cannot  sustain 
itself.  It  also  has  the  advantage  of  being  an  admittedly  imperfect  remedy,  dramati-
cally  increasing  the  likelihood  that  neither  the  Joint  Board  nor  the  FCC  will  find 
it  a  necessary  and  sufficient  solution  and  thereby  make  it  possible  to  ‘‘declare  vic-
tory’’. 

Disaggregation  is  not  a  new  concept  for  the  FCC’s  consideration.  In  the  Rural 
Task  Force  Order  of  2001,  the  FCC  recommended  disaggregation  for  rural  carriers; 
however,  only  a  small  minority  of  all  rural  carriers  took  advantage  of  this  oppor-
tunity.  I  believe  that  disaggregation  is  essential  and  not  incompatible  with  a  prop-
erly-designed reverse auction solution or other alternative for USF reform, including 
a models-based solution, provided anti-‘‘gaming’’ protections are built in. 

Question  3.  Can  reverse  auctions  be  implemented  in  a  manner  that  is  truly  com-
petitively  and  technologically  neutral?  Wouldn’t  such  a  plan  inevitably  mandate 
technology-based ‘‘winners’’ and ‘‘losers?’’ 

Answer.  Yes,  a  reverse  auction  approach  can  be  adopted  which  is  both  competi-
tively and technologically neutral. As I have advocated previously, a reverse auction 
may  well  need  to  be  linked  to  other  reforms  such  as  disaggregation  to  assure  both 
neutrality and compliance with legislative intent. 

Taken as a whole, the current framework, well-intentioned as it was, is all about 
choosing winners and losers. In too many cases, providers are not being held to ac-
count or expected to appropriately steward the funds which they receive. A relative 
handful of states are according a virtual free pass to USF funding through their fail-
ure  to  implement  the  voluntary  guidelines  for  screening  CETC  applicants  promul-
gated by the FCC in its March 17, 2005 ETC Order.1 

As long as these circumstances exist, those of us who shape public policy—whether 
serving in Congress, on the FCC, or as a member of a State Commission—are choos-
ing winners, even if that is usually as an act of omission rather than of commission. 
When  we  do  so,  we  are  also  choosing  losers:  the  American  people,  in  the  form  of 
higher-than-necessary USF levies placed upon ratepayers. 

Virtually  any  form  of  reverse  auction  which  has  been  discussed  in  conjunction 
with  the  Joint  Board’s  current  proceeding  will  produce  ‘‘losers,’’  by  design.  The 
whole purpose of a reverse auction model is to derive the greatest value for the least 
possible  investment  of  ‘‘high-cost  dollars’’  for  the  customer.  In  some  circumstances 
one  technology  may  advantage  its  user  over  the  differing  technologies  of  other  pro-
viders  competing  to  serve  in  the  same  geographic  area.  But  in  a  reverse  auction, 
each  provider  is  free  to  determine  how  little  s/he  is  willing  to  accept  in  return  for 
the  ‘‘franchise’’  to  serve  an  area.  If  s/he  is  willing  to  pay  more  dearly  by  accepting 
a  lower  level  of  compensation  than  the  competition—regardless  of  cost  differentials 
which  may  exist  intermodally—then  s/he  will  be  the  ‘‘winner.’’  Thus  the  ‘‘winner’’ 
is  the  bidder  who  brings  the  greatest  value  for  the  least  cost  to  the  customer.  The 
question is whether it would be deemed politically acceptable.

The  winners/losers  issue  depends  on  vendors’  definitions  of  the  value  of  subsidy. 
A  higher  cost  vendor  may  elect  to  receive  a  lower  margin  than  his/her  competitors, 
in  order  to  retain  or  gain  the  incremental  revenue  produced  through  high-cost  sup-
port.  So  the  vendors  themselves  determine  what  is  ‘‘fair,’’  by  the  full  value  they 
place on ‘‘winning.’’ 

When  you  let  the  bidders  determine  the  value  of  the  subsidy  they  are  eligible  to 
receive  as  the  successful  bidder  or  bidders,  then  by  definition  the  winner  receives 
full value, and all ‘‘losers’’ are losers because they set a higher value than the mar-
ket  (through  the  reverse  auction  mechanism)  was  willing  to  attach  to  provision  of 
service. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

HON. JOHN DOWNES BURKE 

Question 1. In 1997, the FCC adopted the principle that its Universal Service poli-
cies  should  be  ‘‘competitively  neutral.’’  In  explaining  this  principle,  the  FCC  con-
cluded  that  ‘‘competitive  neutrality  means  that  Universal  Service  support  mecha-
nisms and rules neither unfairly advantage nor disadvantage one provider over an-
other,  and  neither  unfairly  favor  nor  disfavor  one  technology  over  another.’’  But  it 
seems  that  people  have  different  views  as  to  how  that  principle  should  be  applied, 
particularly  when  it  comes  to  providing  support  for  different  kinds  of  communica-
tions  platforms.  As  members  of  the  Joint  Board,  do  you  believe  that  this  remains 
a  valuable  principle,  and  how  should  it  be  applied  to  competition  both  among  and 
between communications platforms? 

Answer.  Competitive  neutrality  seemed  an  appropriate  and  important  principle 
when  the  FCC  and  the  Joint  Board  were  first  trying  to  implement  the  1996  Act. 
At that time the overwhelming objective of Federal policy was to open the local ex-
change network to competition, and many new policies were aimed at giving a boost 
to  the  infant  CLEC  industry.  But  Universal  Service  was  also  an  important  goal 
under the Act. Competitive neutrality should not be an obstacle to the primary goal 
of  preserving  and  advancing  universal  service.  Neutrality  does  not  provide  a  suffi-
cient  basis  for  a  subsidy  that  does  not  demonstrably  advance  Universal  Service 
goals,  particularly  when  it  inflates  the  contributions  required  from  telephone  sub-
scribers. 
The Identical Support 

Competitive  neutrality  is  often  today  considered  synonymous  with  the  ‘‘Identical 
Support  Rule’’  (‘‘ISR’’).  Under  ISR,  a  Competitive  Eligible  Telecommunications  Car-
rier  (‘‘CETC’’)  receives  per-line  support  equal  to  that  given  to  the  Incumbent  Local 
Exchange Carriers (‘‘ILEC’’) serving a customer. If ILEC ‘‘A’’ and an CETC ‘‘B’’ have 
customers  with  billing  addresses  in  the  same  ILEC  wire  center,  they  receive  equal 
per-line support. 

The  ISR,  although  motivated  by  competitive  neutrality,  is  not  neutral.  The  ISR 
allows that carriers A and B both get support based on carrier A’s costs. A competi-
tively neutral rule would, for example, award support to each based on its own cost; 
or it might award support to both based upon some third factor not dependent upon 
either’s network. 

Nor  does  the  ISR  produce  competitively  neutral  results.  While  the  support 
amounts  are  the  same  for  A  and  B,  they  may  have  vastly  different  cost  structures. 
Most  CETCs  are  wireless  carriers.  Wireless  technology  finds  classical  wire  center 
boundaries  largely  irrelevant.  Wireless  carrier  costs  and  deployment  are  signifi-
cantly  affected  by  factors,  such  as  topography,  that  are  less  important  for  wireline 
carriers. Moreover, for many rural customers, their address is largely irrelevant be-
cause they cannot receive wireless service at home, but subscribe because they trav-
el.  There  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  a  support  dollar  given  to  a  CETC  under  the 
ISR  will  produce  results  anything  like  the  results  of  giving  that  dollar  to  an  ILEC. 
A  second  major  problem  with  the  ISR  is  that  it,  when  combined  with  the  legacy 
procedures  for  calculating  ILEC  support,  has  generated  enormous  Fund  growth. 
CETCs  support  has  been  growing  at  an  annual  rate  of  101  percent  since  2002. 
CETCs received almost $1 billion in 2006. Because wireless carriers are now apply-
ing  for  CETC  status  in  droves,  CETCs  are  on  track  to  receive  over  $1.5  billion  in 
2007.1 

The  ISR  did  not  contemplate  that  a  household  would  retain  its  landline  and  add 
three or four supported wireless phones as well. Under the ISR, all of these phones 
can receive an equal subsidy.

There is another and more complex reason for the increase. ISR works in tandem 
with legacy support mechanism of ILECs.2 The following table illustrates how com-
petition  could  increase  total  support  in  a  high-cost  area  more  than  tenfold,  even 
without the total number of lines increasing.3

Commonly,  CETC  access  lines  increase  faster  than  ILEC  lines  decrease.  Modi-
fying  the  preceding  analysis  to  reflect  that  fact  would  only  increase  CETC  support 
more rapidly. 

The  combined  effect  of  these  ISR  and  legacy  ILEC  mechanisms  has  been  to  sub-
sidize the construction of second, third and fourth networks in high-cost areas where 
it  was  historically  difficult  to  finance  construction  of  the  original  network.  This 
might  be  a  good  result  in  the  narrow  case  of  a  wireless  network  extending  service 
to  a  previously  unserved  rural  area,  but  is  not  a  sound  general  policy.  There  is  no 
indication that the USF was designed, even in part, to subsidize robust competition 
in hard-to-serve areas. 

A third major problem with the ISR is that it generally provides too much or too 
little  support  to  CETCs.  Even  if  one  assumes  that  there  is  sufficient  support  for 
ILECs,4 the  ISR  generally  will  produce  more-than-sufficient  or  less-than-sufficient 
support for CETCs. 

As  the  table  above  shows,  support  to  CETCs  can  easily  be  more  than  sufficient. 
In a market with intense competition, a CETC with a high market share can receive 
many times the per-line support ($585) that the incumbent received before competi-
tors  arrived  ($53).  This  is  particularly  incongruous  if  the  CETC  has  superior  tech-
nology  that  provides  telecommunications  services  more  efficiently  than  the  legacy 
technology. 

Support  to  CETCs  can  also  be  less  than  sufficient  to  support  a  network  capable 
of  serving  all  customers  in  the  service  area.  Two  wireless  CETCs  might  share  a 
market,  for  example,  and  might  have  similar  facilities  and  receive  equal  per-line 
support payments. Yet if one CETC has an 50 percent market share and the second 
CETC has a 1 percent market share, the first will receive 50 times as much support 
as  the  second.  This  is  no  recipe  for  maintaining  continued  service  by  the  second 
CETC.  On  the  contrary,  this  is  a  potentially  unstable  condition  in  which  Federal 
support might be used by larger carriers to drive out smaller competitors. 

A fourth major problem with the ISR is that it awards support without any clear 
objective  or  meaningful  performance  expectation.  The  great  majority  of  CETC 
money  actually  goes  to  wireless  carriers,  but  this  has  little  demonstrable  relation 
to Universal Service goals. 

Wireless  carriers  generally  offer  nationwide  rates.  Therefore,  although  support  to 
a  wireless  carrier  may  promote  greater  service  availability,  it  does  not  have  an  ef-
fect  on  whether  a  customer  living  in  a  high-cost  area  receives  wireless  service  at 
affordable and comparable rates. 

Much  of  the  money  transferred  to  CETCs  under  the  ISR  is  based  on  the  ‘‘IAS’’ 
and ‘‘ICLS’’ programs. This funding for ILECs was historically derived from specific 
access  rate  reduction  decisions  by  the  FCC.  The  connection  to  CETCs  is  tenuous. 

2 Legacy  support  mechanisms  for  ILECs  are  intended  to  provide  sufficient  support  for  the 
ILECs  to  operate  a  wireline  network.  When  an  ILEC  has  fewer  lines  supporting  its  network 
that generally increases per-line cost, and that increases per-line support for the ILEC’s remain-
ing customers. The EPR then equally increases per-line support to CETCs. Total support there-
by increases rapidly as more customers are served by CETCs. 

3 The support mechanism illustrated here is to provide support equal to 76 percent of the dif-
ference between per-line cost per month and $30 per month. This is most similar to the support 
mechanism current used for nonrural carriers. The ‘‘intense competition’’ example here assumes 
that the ILEC loses 90 percent of its original lines. This is an extreme case chosen to illustrate 
the  point,  but  it  is  not  totally  implausible  given  the  inroads  now  being  made  by  wireless  and 
VoIP, and the impending widespread availability of VoIP over cable systems. 

4 The  Tenth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  found  in  2005  that  the  FCC  had  not  demonstrably  pro-
vided  sufficient  support  to  customers  of  so-called  ‘‘nonrural’’  carriers.  Qwest  v.  FCC,  398  F.3d

In  other  words,  CETCs  today  are  receiving  millions  of  dollars  in  support  because 
the  local  ILEC  once  had  high  interstate  access  rates.  For  the  ILECs,  this  money 
may  once  have  had  a  connection  to  Universal  Service  objectives.  Porting  it  over  to 
CETCs does not significantly advance any Universal Service objectives. 
Alternatives 

The  arrival  of  real  competition  in  high-cost  rural  areas  forces  us  to  face  several 
unpleasant  alternatives.  If  we  keep  the  ISR,  the  Fund  will  continue  to  grow  expo-
nentially, and we will pay more to CETCs than they need to provide service. 

On the other hand, abandoning the ISR will require us to grapple with some dif-
ficult  problems.  The  most  immediate  would  be  to  determine  how  many  networks 
merit support in a given area, and how they should be selected. This could conceiv-
ably  be  done  by  auctions,  but  auctions  have  myriad  administrative  difficulties,  and 
it is not clear these can all be solved. 

Second,  we  would  need  to  decide  whether  the  inherent  differences  among  net-
works  should  affect  support.  Different  networks  have  different  cost  structures  and 
present  different  subsidy  considerations.  Wireless  uses  different  types  of  facilities 
with different kinds of propagation characteristics, and this certainly leads to a cost 
structure that is much different than ILECs. Moreover, wireless carriers often build 
facilities  to  serve  customers  who  have  billing  addresses  tens  or  hundreds  of  miles 
away.  Wireless  carriers  also  have  different  kinds  of  revenues  and  costs  from  inter-
carrier  transactions.  All  of  this  could  be  relevant  to  a  support  mechanism  for  wire-
less carriers. 

Another  possibility  is  to  cap  the  total  support  offered  in  a  study  area  or  state. 
This  has  significant  risks  also.  Capped  support  may  not  be  sufficient  for  ILECs  to 
keep  their  retail  rates  affordable  and  reasonably  comparable.  With  a  cap,  there  is 
a  risk  that  all  networks  would  fail  or,  more  likely,  constrain  service  to  the  lowest 
cost  areas.  Failure  of  the  ILEC  would  be  particularly  problematic  where  a  CETC 
depends (as do most wireless carriers) on the ILEC for network transport functions. 
Finally, one could adopt separate wireline and wireless Universal Service systems. 
Such  a  system  would  be  able  to  acknowledge  the  differences  between  the  tech-
nologies,  derive  an  appropriate  business  model  for  each  that  leads  to  a  support 
amount,  and  thereby  provide  sufficient  support  to  meet  the  statutory  objectives  in 
Section 254. 
Conclusion 

My  primary  conclusion  is  that  the  principle  of  competitive  neutrality  should  be 

made secondary to other, more important, principles, such as: 

consumers, either in the form of reduced rates or increased availability. 

• Universal  Service  support  payments  should  produce  a  demonstrable  benefit  to 
• Funding  should  be  sufficient  to  ensure  that  customers  everywhere  have  access 
to  at  least  one  telecommunications  service  that  provides  acceptable  service  at 
comparable  rates.  That  should  include  broadband  service,  at  a  specific  date  in 
the future. 
• Public funds should not be provided automatically to every network that is con-
structed  with  private  capital.  Subsidies  should  go  to  only  a  limited  number  of 
networks in high-cost areas. For discussion purposes, I would suggest that fund-
ing be available in any area to only one wireline and one wireless network. This 
is  not  intended  to  limit  in  any  way  the  uses  of  private  capital  or  to  limit  com-
petition among privately financed networks. 
• Universal  Service  policy  can  legitimately  differentiate  among  competing  tele-
communications  technologies.  Funding  should  impose  an  obligation  to  meet 
minimum  standards,  even  if  this  would  effectively  disqualify  a  particular  tech-
nology. 
• Universal Service support should be based upon the reasonable financial needs 
of the supported carrier. This requires consideration of revenues available from 
all  sources,  including  intercarrier  revenues  and  all  subscriber  revenues  from 
regulated and nonregulated activities. 

My second conclusion is that the ISR should be abandoned. No carrier should re-
ceive  support  based  upon  another  carrier’s  costs  and  revenues.  Support  to  wireless 
carriers  could  conceivably  be  based  upon  a  wireless  cost  model,  but  these  carriers 
may also need to submit actual cost information and actual facility location informa-
tion as a prerequisite to support. 

Question  2.  Section  254(c)  of  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  defines  Uni-
versal  Service  as  ‘‘an  evolving  level  of  telecommunications  services’’  and  also  sets 
forth criteria that the FCC considers when it decides which services qualify as ‘‘sup-

ported  services’’  eligible  for  Universal  Service  support.  At  present,  it  is  my  under-
standing  that  the  Universal  Service  Fund  does  not  support  broadband  service.  But 
then,  the  question  always  arises—should  it?  And  if  so,  when?  Do  you  think  that 
Universal  Service  should  evolve  to  support  broadband  services,  and  if  so,  what 
would  trigger  such  a  determination?  Given  that  the  law  defines  Universal  Service 
as  an  evolving  level  of  ‘‘telecommunications  services’’  and  given  that  the  FCC  has 
classified  cable  modem  and  DSL  services  as  ‘‘information  services,’’  would  the  Con-
gress need to change the statute to make broadband eligible for support? 

Answer. Yes, Universal Service should evolve to support broadband services. That 
decision should be made now, and reasonable target dates should be set for compli-
ance.  For  example,  it  might  be  reasonable  to  set  a  target  that  95  percent  of  the 
American  public  would  have  access  to  a  broadband  service  by  2010.  In  this  context 
‘‘access’’ would mean that a person could purchase broadband at his or her residence 
or  place  of  business  from  one  or  more  sources  at  a  rate  that  is  reasonably  com-
parable to urban rates. Broadband should be defined in a way that encourages mat-
uration  of  the  network,  but  that  does  not  disqualify  services  that  are  now  widely 
subscribed to. 

Congress should amend section 254 of the Act. Regardless of whether it explicitly 
defines  broadband  as  an  ‘‘eligible  service,’’  it  should  amend  subsections  254(c)  and 
254(e). 
Subsection 254(c) 

Subsection  254(c)  envisions  a  binary  decision  on  telecommunications  services; 
services are either included or not included. If broadband were defined as an ‘‘eligi-
ble service,’’ then three consequences follow: (1) broadband would become part of the 
minimum  standard  for  eligibility  as  an  Eligible  Telecommunications  Carrier 
(‘‘ETC’’);  (2)  broadband  costs  may  be  considered  when  calculating  support;  and  (3) 
ETCs  may  spend  Universal  Service  support  to  maintain  broadband  facilities.  In 
other  words,  the  current  statute  requires  that  each  particular  service  be  both  man-
datory and permitted, or neither. 

Some  existing  ETCs  do  not  offer  broadband  to  all  their  customers.  Therefore  if 
broadband  is  added  to  the  list  under  section  254(c),  some  existing  ETCs  might  be 
disqualified unless they could offer broadband to all their customers. In my opinion, 
such mass disqualification would be undesirable, but it is not clear how to avoid this 
result  if  broadband  is  added  to  the  list  of  supported  services.  This  tension  between 
mandatory  and  permissive  services  makes  it  difficult  for  the  FCC  to  add  services 
to  the  list.  Although  the  express  intent  of  section  254  was  for  Universal  Service 
standards  to  evolve  over  time,  the  structure  of  section  254(c)  makes  such  evolution 
a very high stakes process with possibly punitive results. 

I do not want to imply that the statute has been an absolute barrier to progress. 
Universal  service  payments  have  actually  supported  the  development  of  broadband 
networks in some areas. Notably, the ‘‘High Cost Loop’’ (‘‘HCL’’) program, the FCC’s 
largest  single  high-cost  program,5 supports  the  ‘‘loop  cost’’  of  hundreds  of  smaller 
so-called  ‘‘rural’’  carriers.  HCL  support  is  calculated  based  on  the  carrier’s  invest-
ment  level  in  its  ‘‘loop’’  facilities,  the  wires  and  distributed  platforms  that  are  out-
side  central  offices.  Many  rural  carriers  have  built  broadband  networks  capable  of 
providing  DSL  services,  and  some  have  even  built  fiber  networks  capable  of  deliv-
ering video. In most cases these investments have generated HCL support. 

Not only does the HCL program support broadband buildout, it seems to have de-
veloped  a  preference  for  broadband.  The  HCL  program  is  capped.  Many  rural  car-
riers  increased  their  per-line  investment,  and  the  differential  effect  has  been  to 
draw  support  away  from  carriers  that  merely  provide  voice  service,  while  adding 
support  to  carriers  that  have  broadband-capable  and  even  video-capable  networks. 
Thus, although broadband has not yet become a supported service, one major FCC 
program  is  currently  providing  de  facto  support  for  broadband.  This  result  was  ex-
plained through the Joint Board’s policy of avoiding ‘‘barriers’’ to broadband.6 While 

5 The HCL program’s annualized cost is $1.4 billion. 
6 This  policy  was  suggested  in  2000  by  the  ‘‘Rural  Task  Force,’’  which  said  that  there  should 
be  ‘‘no  barriers  to  advanced  services.’’  See  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service,  CC 
Docket No. 96–45, Rural Task Force Recommendation To The Federal-State Joint Board On Uni-
versal Service, released Sept. 29, 2000, at 22 (policy should incorporate the following principles: 
a. Universal Service funding should support plant that can, either as built or with the addition 
of plant elements, when available, provide access to advanced services. State commissions could

but non-complying facilities. b. Telecommunications carriers should be encouraged by regulatory 
measures  to  remove  infrastructure  barriers  relating  to  access  to  advanced  services.  c.  The  Fed-
eral Universal Service support fund should be sized so that it presents no barriers to investment 
in plant needed to provide access to advanced services. Specifically, to remain ‘‘sufficient’’ under

143 

this was a creative way to advance broadband deployment, it has been controversial, 
and  it  has  not  been  applied  to  all  carriers  equally.  In  most  states,  nearly  all  of  the 
customers  of  ‘‘rural’’  carriers  have  access  to  advanced  broadband  networks;  but  it 
is also common to learn that their rural neighbors who happen to be served by larg-
er carriers cannot get DSL. 

Congress should consider amending section 254 in a way that authorizes support 
for broadband, but that does not unintentionally disqualify existing ETCs. The cho-
sen path should provide support in rural areas without regard to the size of the car-
rier  that  happens  to  serve  the  area.  One  step  in  the  right  direction  would  be  to 
amend  section  254(c)  to  allow  some  services  to  be  supportable  without  also  being 
mandatory. 
Subsection 254(e) 

Congress might also clarify the statutory injunction in section 254(e). This statute 
limits  the  uses  of  support  ‘‘only  for  the  provision,  maintenance,  and  upgrading  of 
facilities  and  services  for  which  the  support  is  intended.’’  Several  ambiguities  arise 
under this language. Incumbent LECs sometimes argue that this language requires 
no  more  than  that  they  continue  to  provide  minimally  adequate  service  over  their 
existing facilities. Since all Federal high-cost support becomes revenue to these car-
riers, and since they provide the minimally acceptable level of service, this standard 
in some cases does not have much effect on either services or rates. 

Under FCC guidance, ETCs must today make annual reports to the FCC.7 Those 
reports must include a report on progress under the carrier’s ‘‘five-year service qual-
ity improvement plan.’’ 8 However, nothing in the current rules requires network im-
provement  plans  to  include  broadband  by  any  date-certain.  The  reports  must  also 
include ‘‘the number of requests for service from potential customers . . . that were 
unfulfilled  during  the  past  year’’  and  how  the  carrier  ‘‘attempted  to  provide  service 
to those potential customers.’’ 9 

More  rigorous  approaches  are  possible.  For  example,  Verizon-Vermont’s  ‘‘Model- 
based’’ high-cost support increased significantly in 2000. That increase has been dis-
tributed as explicit credits on monthly customer bills.10 

If Congress wishes to achieve more significant or more demonstrable results from 
Universal  Service  support,  it  might  clarify  subsection  254(e).  One  option  would  be 
to  mandate  that  all  high-cost  funds  appear  as  explicit  credits  on  customer  bills.11 
Alternatively,  if  Congress  wishes  to  allow  carriers  to  continue  treating  Universal 
Service  support  as  carrier  revenue,  it  might  directly  mandate  that  carriers  adopt 
service  quality  improvement  plans  and  further  mandate  that  those  plans  call  for 
broadband by a specific date. 
Information Services 

As the last part of the question suggests, recent FCC decisions narrowing the defi-
nition of ‘‘telecommunications services’’ may have created a barrier to providing Uni-
versal Service support to broadband. 

Some broadband services still are telecommunications services,12 but the FCC has 
declared  a  wide  range  of  retail  broadband  services  to  be  ‘‘information  services,’’  in-
cluding cable modem service 13 and ‘‘facilities-based wireline broadband Internet ac-
cess service’’ (DSL).14 Moreover, the FCC has repeatedly stated that when a service 
is an ‘‘information service’’ it cannot also be a ‘‘telecommunications service.’’

Various  provisions  of  47  U.S.C.  § 254  suggest  that  Federal  support  may  be  pro-
vided  only  to  support  ‘‘telecommunications  services.’’  For  example,  subsection  (c)(1) 
says  that  ‘‘[u]niversal  service  is  an  evolving  level  of  telecommunications  services.’’ 
A more specific passage in that same paragraph states: 

The Joint Board in recommending, and the Commission in establishing, the def-
inition  of  the  services  that  are  supported  by  Federal  Universal  Service  support 
mechanisms  shall  consider  the  extent  to  which  such  telecommunications  serv-
ices. . . .15 

This implies that only telecommunications services may be included in the defini-
tion  of  ‘‘services  that  are  supported  by  Federal  Universal  Service  support  mecha-
nisms.’’  The  argument  is  only  strengthened  by  subdivision  (c)(3)  which  allows  the 
schools  and  libraries  and  healthcare  programs  to  support  ‘‘additional  services’’  not 
on the official list. 

On the contrary, it is also clear that section 254 establishes an overall goal of pro-
moting  access  to  advanced  services.  This  is  evident  in  subdivision  (b)(2)  which  sets 
the goal of providing ‘‘Access to advanced telecommunications and information serv-
ices in all regions of the Nation.’’ However, such a general goal may not be sufficient 
to override specific contrary terms in the operational parts of section 254. 

On  balance,  I  believe  that  under  the  existing  statute  there  are  serious  questions 

about: 

1.  whether  Federal  funds  may  be  used  to  support  services  that  are  not  on  the 
list of supported services under section 254(c)(1); and 
2. whether an information service can be a supported service. 

I recommend that Congress clarify subsection 254(c) on these points. 
Question 3. Currently the wireless eligible telecommunications carriers (ETCs) re-
ceive  Universal  Service  support  on  a  ‘‘per  customer’’  basis  based  on  the  ‘‘per  line’’ 
costs  of  the  wireline  carrier  in  the  same  geographic  area.  This  is  sometimes  called 
the ‘‘identical support rule’’ and ensures that different communications platform pro-
viders  receive  the  same  amount  of  ‘‘per  line’’  support.  One  criticism  of  the  so-called 
‘‘identical  support  rule’’  for  Universal  Service  is  that  it  results  in  overly  generous 
support  to  wireless  carriers  because  levels  of  support  are  not  based  on  the  per  line 
cost of providing wireless services. As a result, I have two questions—— 

wireless services in rural America? 

• First,  do  you  believe  that  Universal  Service  should  support  both  wireline  and 
• Second,  would  it  be  possible  to  construct  a  model  for  wireless  carriers  that 
would  calculate  support  based  on  costs  of  wireless  carriers,  and  what  effect 
might that have on the size of the fund? 

Answer. 

Wireline and Wireless 

Yes, I do believe that Universal Service should support both wireline and wireless 
services in rural America. However, as I explained above in some detail I have seri-
ous reservations about the Identical Support Rule. 

We should seriously consider supporting wireless under a separate program. This 
would allow the separate programs to be designed more sensibly. They could reflect 
differences in signal propagation characteristics, differences in the extent of existing 
deployment, different deployment and service goals, and possibly by different expec-
tations about how funds will be used and accounted for. 

I would encourage the Congress to authorize matching grants as a way to increase 
deployment of both wireless and wireline broadband technologies. While these tech-
nologies  can  create  significant  revenue  streams  once  facilities  have  been  built,  the 
initial  construction  costs  are  daunting,  particularly  in  areas  of  low  density  and  in 
areas where rugged terrain limits the propagation of wireless signals. 

In  my  state,  we  face  very  real  limits  in  current  broadband  deployment;  but  we 
are  working  hard  to  improve  the  situation.  I  don’t  think  Vermont  is  unique  in  this 
regard.  States  can  have  very  detailed  and  relevant  knowledge  about  where 
broadband  improvements  are  needed.  Particularly  if  Federal  funds  are  matched, 
Congress can be sure they will be spent wisely. 
Wireless Cost Model 

Yes,  it  is  possible  to  construct  a  model  of  wireless  costs,  and  that  work  is  largely 
complete. A commercially available model was used, for example, in the recent Wyo-

15 See 47 U.S.C. § 254(c).

ming  project  that  Commissioner  Landis  described  in  his  March  1  oral  testimony.16 
There  might  be  issues  adapting  it  for  FCC  purposes,  such  as  making  all  of  the  in-
puts public, but most of the technical challenges have been solved. 

However, that is only a partial answer because a cost model only calculates costs. 
One  also  needs  a  support  model  to  calculate  support.  Support  models  require  addi-
tional  data  inputs  and  policy  decisions.  Support  models  also  present  the  most  dif-
ficult  policy  challenges,  because  they  confront  most  directly  the  tension  between 
competition and universal service. 

One  difficult  issue  for  support  models  is  carrier  revenues.  The  common  goal  of 
support  programs  is  to  manage  the  payments  that  the  carrier  ultimately  demands 
from its subscriber. Support is adjusted to keep these payments within limits, using 
standards  such  as  ‘‘affordable’’  or  ‘‘reasonably  comparable.’’  In  reality,  those  cus-
tomer  payments  are  affected  by  the  carrier’s  entire  business  model,  and  that  cer-
tainly  includes  payments  made  to  and  revenues  received  from  other  carriers.  Car-
riers  now  produce  many  kinds  of  revenues,  only  some  of  which  are  ‘‘regulated’’  in 
the  classical  sense.  Although  this  is  a  complex  policy  area,  current  FCC  support 
mechanisms  could  be  improved  to  make  these  revenue  assumptions  more  explicit 
and  more  comprehensive.  Notably,  we  should  carefully  consider  whether  to  include 
revenue from unregulated services. 

Another difficult issue is the location of the service. Support models typically asso-
ciate  support  with  particular  areas,  and  they  locate  customers  by  their  billing  ad-
dresses.  For  wireline  service,  this  practice  makes  sense  because  wireline  customers 
typically  receive  and  use  the  service  at  their  billing  location.  That  is  not  true  for 
wireless, however. A wireless customer’s billing address can have little relationship 
to  service;  some  wireless  customers  cannot  even  get  a  signal  at  home.  Moreover, 
wireless  facilities  are  often  constructed  primarily  to  serve  passing  customers  who 
are  billed  in  other  places.  Consider  a  cell  tower  located  next  to  a  remote  stretch  of 
interstate  highway.  The  number  of  customers  who  have  a  nearby  billing  address 
bears  no  relation  to  the  reason  that  tower  was  built,  and  it  would  be  a  mistake  to 
assume  that  the  tower  is  serving  only  those  customers  who  have  local  billing  ad-
dresses. 

The most difficult issue for both cost models and support models is how to account 
for  multiple  networks.  Consider  wireline  carrier  ‘‘A’’  that  provides  retail  telephone 
service and also provides special access. Consider also wireless carrier ‘‘B’’ that uses 
A’s special access circuits to connect its cell sites. 

First,  consider  the  complications  for  the  cost  model.  A  realistic  estimate  of  B’s 
costs requires one to know how much B must pay A for those special access circuits. 
Furthermore, A and B may share some facilities.17 

For  the  support  model  the  issues  are  even  more  complex,  and  they  are  fraught 
with  policy  judgments  about  whether  support  should  be  used  to  maintain  multiple 
networks. Carrier A’s support might be reduced, for example, to the extent it draws 
(or ought to draw) special access revenue from B. Conversely, if we expect B to con-
tinue providing service, it might be necessary to increase A’s support as B captures 
more  of  A’s  retail  customers.  This  is  exactly  contrary  to  the  original  expectations 
of the Joint Board about how competition would affect support, which assumed that 
support would move away from A when B captured A’s customer. 

In short, even if one has already developed a good wireless cost model, calculating 
support  still  requires  resolution  of  several  significant  policy  issues.  Therefore,  the 
availability  of  a  wireless  cost  model  is  only  the  first  of  several  difficult  steps  in  de-
veloping a support mechanism. 

The current size of the high-cost fund, $4.3 billion, is probably sufficient to main-
tain  a  quality  wireline  and  a  quality  wireless  network.  However,  there  are  major 
tasks ahead. We should establish universal or near-universal wireless coverage and 
broadband coverage, and we should reduce existing inequities that treat some rural 
customers much better than others. Solving these problems will require us to make 
a  difficult  choice  between  either  allowing  the  Fund  to  grow  still  larger  or  reallo-
cating existing support by employing a new and more rational allocation system.

bers-based’’  system  that  would  assess  a  per-line  fee  on  all  working  telephone  lines. 
Do  you  believe  that  this  could  be  implemented  in  a  way  that  would  not  harm  low- 
volume and low-income telecommunications consumers? 

Answer. Yes, a numbers-based contribution method could be implemented without 
harm  to  low-income  and  low-volume  consumers,  but  some  versions  of  a  numbers- 
based plan could cause harm. 

Currently  USF  contributions  are  made  as  a  percentage  of  interstate  and  inter-
national  retail  phone  bills.  Some  carriers,  such  as  wireless  carriers  and  VoIP  pro-
viders, are allowed to use a ‘‘safe harbor’’ calculation that presumes that a fixed per-
centage of their traffic is interstate and subject to the USF charge. 

A  customer  who  avoids  all  usage  charges  for  interstate  and  international  calls 
(‘‘toll-free  customer’’)  typically  pays  the  USF  charge  only  on  the  Subscriber  Line 
Charge (SLC). Currently the national average residential SLC is $5.81 and the cur-
rent  USF  rate  is  11.7  percent.  Therefore,  an  average  toll-free  customer  currently 
contributes about $0.68 per month to USF. 
Low-Volume Customers 

Shifting the contribution basis from revenues to numbers would have two effects. 
• It  would  reduce  contributions  from  customers  who  have  large  interstate  or 
international service bills but few telephone numbers. Such customers likely in-
clude  many  business  customers  who  have  substantial  expenditures  for  inter-
state services such as toll services and interstate ‘‘special access’’ (point-to-point) 
lines.  Some  residential  customers  also  have  substantial  interstate  or  inter-
national toll calling bills. 

• It  would  increase  contributions  from  customers  who  have  modest  interstate 
service  bills  or  many  telephone  numbers.  Most  customers  who  make  few  tele-
phone calls would pay larger contributions. 

Some proposals for shifting to telephone numbers also would impose the unit USF 
charge  on  ‘‘connections’’  or  special  point-to-point  circuits.  This  question  should  not 
be overlooked. 

For example, a ‘‘T–1’’ or ‘‘DS–1’’telephone line can be thought of as a single ‘‘con-
nection’’  or  as  24  voice-grade  channels.  A  ‘‘T–3’’  or  ‘‘DS–3’’  line  can  be  thought  of 
as  one  ‘‘connection’’  or  as  672  voice-grade  channels.  A  contribution  mechanism  that 
imposes  some  form  of  charge  on  such  special  access  circuits  would  likely  reduce 
charges  on  low-volume  customers.  A  plan  that  requires  greater  contributions  from 
larger  capacity  special  access  circuits  would  further  reduce  any  potential  harm  to 
low-volume customers. 

As  noted  above,  the  current  USF  charge  for  a  toll-free  wireline  customer  is  prob-
ably  about  $0.70  per  month.  Estimates  of  a  numbers-based  contribution  method-
ology  were  recently  filed  with  the  FCC  in  its  intercarrier  compensation  docket.18 
That  filing  estimated  the  effect  of  collecting  Universal  Service  revenues  through  a 
surcharge  imposed  on  614  million  telephone  numbers  and  special  access  connec-
tions.19 Based on that estimate, current USF costs 20 could be covered by a uniform 
surcharge of almost exactly $1.00.  21 Therefore a telephone number-based contribu-
tion method would likely increase payments by toll-free wireline customers by about 
$0.30 per month. 

Prepaid  wireless  users  often  have  small  monthly  bills  as  well.  The  current  USF 
charge  for  a  minimally  used  prepaid  wireless  customer  is  about  $0.45  per  month.22 
A plan that would increase contributions to $1.00 per month would therefore rough-
ly  double  the  burden  of  USF  charges  on  such  customers.  This  could  also  produce 
significant  harm  to  the  carriers  that  offer  prepaid  wireless  service,  reducing  the  cost 
advantage they currently enjoy as against post-paid wireless plans. 

18 See  Letter  to  Marlene  Dortch,  Secretary  of  FCC,  January  30,  2007,  in  CC  Docket  No.  01– 
92, Missoula Plan Amendment to Incorporate a Federal Benchmark Mechanism, filed by Indiana 
Utility  Regulatory  Commission,  Maine  Public  Utilities  Commission,  Nebraska  Public  Service 
Commission,  Vermont  Department  of  Public  Service,  Vermont  Public  Service  Board,  Wyoming

19 Lifeline customers were excluded. 
20 The second quarter USAC report shows high-cost programs costing, on an annualized basis, 

$4.35 billion, and the entire USF program at $7.36 billion. 

21 The intercarrier compensation filing estimated a charge of $0.95 producing $6.97 billion. 
22 Prepaid  wireless  customers  ordinarily  have  monthly  bills  of  about  $10.  Under  the  FCC’s 
safe-harbor rule for wireless, 37.1% of such retail bills are considered interstate. At the current 
USF  rate  of  11.7%,  a  prepaid  wireless  customer  would  pay  $0.43  per  month  in  USF  charges.

Low-Income 

Many  low-income  wireline  customers  limit  their  toll  calls,  and  they  can  also  be 
expected to avoid the more expensive ‘‘bundles’’ that include unlimited toll services. 
Therefore,  a  wireline  customer  who  is  a  low-volume  customer  is  likely  to  be  a  low- 
income  customer  as  well.  The  same  is  true  of  wireless  services.  Prepaid  wireless 
services  are  substantially  less  expensive  than  post-paid  subscriptions  provided  by 
the  major  carriers.  Prepaid  wireless  carriers  assert  that  they  serve  predominantly 
low-income  customers.23 Therefore  a  change  that  increases  the  burden  on  low-vol-
ume customers is likely to increase the burden on low-income customers. 

If  a  per-number  contribution  mechanism  would  indeed  harm  low-income  cus-
tomers,  that  harm  might  be  mitigated  or  even  offset  by  exempting  Lifeline  cus-
tomers from paying the USF charge.24 

Question 2. The concept of reverse auctions has been widely discussed as one solu-
tion  to  the  problem  of  unchecked  High-Cost  Fund  growth.  How  fast  do  you  believe 
a  reverse  auction  program  could  be  implemented?  Why  is  it  better  than  other  ap-
proaches—such  as  study  area  caps  or  disaggregation?  And,  if  implemented,  what 
sort of savings do you think reverse auctions would provide? 

Answer.  As  I  discussed  above,  current  Universal  Service  policy  takes  a  pro-com-
petitive stance about the number of competitors who can receive support in a single 
area. The Identical Support Rule (‘‘ISR’’) treats all ETCs as equal, but it has shown 
itself incapable of restraining fund growth. I believe we should replace the ISR with 
a  plan  that  supports  fewer  carriers  in  high-cost  areas.  However,  this  will  require 
us to differentiate between the winners who will get support and the losers who will 
not.  This  is  a  difficult  and  distasteful  task  because  of  the  economic  effects  of  Uni-
versal Service support. If we give Universal Service support to a single carrier, that 
carrier  will  have  an  enormous  competitive  advantage.  It  may  be  sufficient  to  effec-
tively block robust wireline competition in that local exchange market. 

Auctions offer the conceptual possibility that we could select one or two networks 
for support, but without the usual dilemmas. With auctions, the FCC might be able 
to  use  a  facially  neutral  process  that  rewards  the  most  efficient  competitor,  but 
without having to overtly pick an exclusive franchisee. In short, auctions offer a the-
oretical  possibility  that  we  could  limit  fund  size  in  a  way  that  minimally  harms 
competition and which lets the process, rather than the regulators pick the winners. 
But  I  am  not  convinced  that  auctions  can  be  implemented  successfully  as  a  full 
replacement  for  the  existing  systems.  We  have  received  many  proposals,  but  they 
differ radically on fundamental points. These include: 

of support, or there might be no bids at all. 

• Should auctions be held in all areas or only in competitive areas? 
• Should there be a separate wireless auction? 
• Should there be one winner or many? 
• What Carrier of Last Resort obligations should be imposed on winners? 
In addition, I have several practical concerns about auctions: 
• An  auction  might  simply  fail.  Bids  might  be  higher  than  the  current  amount 
• Networks are interdependent, and awarding support through an auction process 
disturbs  that  system.  Bidders  may  be  forced  to  assume  that  their  competitor’s 
wholesale services will always be available. 
• Two years ago the FCC was told by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, for the 
second  time,  that  our  current  support  mechanism  for  large  carriers  does  not 
provide demonstrably sufficient support. This is an important problem for rural 
customers in many parts of the country who happen to be served by Bell compa-
nies. Auctions are not likely to address that issue fully. 

Study area caps might be imposed to halt growth in the Fund size, but this should 
be only a very short-term solution because it would perpetuate the inequities in the 

23 For example, TracFone Wireles, Inc. filed comments at the FCC in 2002 asserting: 
‘‘As  a  prepaid  wireless  carrier,  TracFone  appeals  to  many  low-income  customers  who  are  un-
able  to  pass  a  credit  check  or  to  afford  security  deposits  required  by  other  CMRS  carriers,  as 
well as many wireline carriers. Approximately 11 percent of TracFone’s customers have annual 
incomes  of  less  than  $15,000  and  approximately  16  percent  of  TracFone’s  customers  have  in-
comes under $25,000.’’

Universal Service, FCC Docket 96–45.

FCC’s intercarrier compensation docket by several state commissions.

current  system.  To  the  extent  that  the  current  system  provides  too  much  support 
to some small suburban carriers, and too little support to some large rural carriers, 
a  cap  would  likely  prevent  adjustments  to  those  support  levels.  Networks  are  dy-
namic,  and  telecommunications  policies  are  changing  rapidly.  Freezing  the  status 
quo for Universal Service support would ignore the dynamic nature of this network 
and make the system’s current imbalances even worse over time. 

fundamental  reform.  First,  most  exchanges 

Disaggregation is an interesting idea, and it may be desirable, but it is not a plan 
for 
in  the  U.S.  are  already 
disaggregated.  The  FCC  simply  mandated  that  support  be  disaggregated  for  areas 
served by large, so-called ‘‘nonrural’’ companies. In these areas, changing line counts 
every quarter increase or decrease the support received by ILECs and CETCs alike. 
Therefore,  disaggregation,  even  if  it  were  mandated,  would  likely  affect  a  small 
number of customers. 

Second,  disaggregation  does  not  always  save  money.  While  the  carriers  have 
shown  that  it  would  reduce  their  support  in  particular  cases,  this  has  not  been 
shown to be generally true. 

Third,  disaggregation  maintains  the  Identical  Service  Rule  (‘‘ISR’’)  but  applies  it 
in a more geographically precise way. I explained above my concerns about the ISR. 
In  brief,  it  relies  upon  the  wireline  carrier’s  exchange  boundaries  and  the  wireline 
carrier’s  exchange  costs  in  order  to  calculate  support  for  a  carrier  that  often  does 
not have exchange boundaries and that has different costs. Making such a rule more 
geographically sensitive might be an improvement, but it ignores more fundamental 
issues. 

Question  3.  Can  reverse  auctions  be  implemented  in  a  manner  that  is  truly  com-
petitively  and  technologically  neutral?  Wouldn’t  such  a  plan  inevitably  mandate 
technology-based ‘‘winners’’ and ‘‘losers?’’ 

Answer.  I  am  not  sure  that  it  is  possible  for  any  Universal  Service  mechanism 
that  distributes  a  finite  support  amount  to  be  ‘‘truly  competitively  and  techno-
logically  neutral.’’  Inevitably,  Universal  Service  support  presents  a  dilemma.  We 
cannot afford to pay support to all carriers, nor would that accomplish anything use-
ful.  Nevertheless,  we  consider  it  repugnant  to  provide  support  to  only  one  or  two 
carriers, thinking that is inconsistent with neutrality. 

The  current  Fund  growth  among  CETCs  illustrates,  in  my  view,  why  we  cannot 
afford  a  solution  that  is  truly  competitively  and  technologically  neutral.  At  most,  I 
would suggest that we should seek competitive neutrality within the constraints im-
posed by other more basic principles. 

It  is  difficult  to  design  an  auction  that  has  no  technological  bias.  Wireline  and 
wireless services have different characteristics and deployment levels, and any such 
difference  could  be  disqualifying.  For  example,  cell  site  backup  batteries  generally 
cannot sustain operations for 12 hours without a recharge. Suppose an auction proc-
ess  required  bidders  to  provide  fully  functional  service  for  24  hours  following  a 
power failure. That requirement would prevent most wireless carriers from offering 
bids and thus would not be considered as competitively neutral. 

Even when an auction is facially neutral, the award of support to a single bidder 
is  itself  likely  to  create  a  preferential  result.  Universal  service  support  can  provide 
a significant competitive advantage to the carriers that receive it. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

HON. BILLY JACK GREGG 

Question 1. In 1997, the FCC adopted the principle that its Universal Service poli-
cies  should  be  ‘‘competitively  neutral.’’  In  explaining  this  principle,  the  FCC  con-
cluded  that  ‘‘competitive  neutrality  means  that  Universal  Service  support  mecha-
nisms and rules neither unfairly advantage nor disadvantage one provider over an-
other,  and  neither  unfairly  favor  nor  disfavor  one  technology  over  another.’’  But  it 
seems  that  people  have  different  views  as  to  how  that  principle  should  be  applied, 
particularly  when  it  comes  to  providing  support  for  different  kinds  of  communica-
tions  platforms.  As  members  of  the  Joint  Board,  do  you  believe  that  this  remains 
a  valuable  principle,  and  how  should  it  be  applied  to  competition  both  among  and 
between communications platforms? 

Answer.  Competitive  neutrality  remains  a  valuable  principle  of  universal  service. 
All  eligible  telecommunications  carriers  (ETCs)  should  be  eligible  for  USF  support, 
regardless of the technology used to provide service. However, many people confuse 
the issue of competitive neutrality with the issue of equal per line support. The two 
issues are not necessarily the same. 

As  originally  conceived,  all  high-cost  support  for  all  carriers  was  to  be  based  on 
the forward-looking economic costs of serving each area, as determined by an econo-

149 

metric model.1 As a result, the costs of serving a particular area would not be based 
on  any  individual  carrier’s  costs,  and  the  per  line  support  available  for  serving  a 
customer in that area would be the same regardless of the technology used to serve 
the  customer.  ETCs,  using  whatever  technology  they  chose,  would  compete  for  this 
support  by  competing  for  customers.  Whichever  ETC  could  provide  high-quality 
service  in  the  most  cost-effective  manner  would  garner  more  support  than  other 
ETCs.  Under  this  approach  new  technologies  could  enter  a  market  and  compete  on 
equal footing with entrenched incumbents. In other words, legacy high-cost support 
would not confer an unfair advantage to the incumbent carrier. 

Unfortunately,  this  is  not  the  way  it  has  worked  out.  Support  based  on  forward- 
looking  economic  cost  has  never  been  extended  to  rural  carriers.  Instead,  support 
for  rural  carriers  is  still  based  on  each  rural  carrier’s  embedded  (legacy)  costs.  In 
addition,  access  replacement  support  for  both  rural  and  non-rural  carriers  is  still 
based  on  embedded  costs.2 Under  the  equal  support  rule  ETCs  with  very  different 
cost  structures  than  an  incumbent  wireline  carrier  nevertheless  receive  the  same 
amount  of  per  line  support  as  the  incumbent  carrier.  Ironically,  as  an  incumbent 
rural carrier loses lines, the amount of per line support goes up, increasing the per 
line support for the competitive ETC as well.3 

Even  worse,  ETCs  rarely  compete  for  support.  Since  the  FCC  adopted  a  policy  in 
1999 of supporting all lines of all ETCs in high-cost areas, wireless ETCs have been 
able  to  receive  support  for  providing  supplementary  lines  in  high-cost  areas.  In 
other words, wireless ETCs—sometimes several wireless ETCs in the same high-cost 
area—are able to draw new support while the incumbent does not lose any support.4 
This  has  caused  the  amount  of  high-cost  support  to  multiply  in  many  high-cost 
areas. For example, within the ATT/BellSouth service territory in Mississippi, ATT/ 
BellSouth draws $101.2 million in high-cost support, while sixteen competitive ETCs 
draw $118.5 million.5 

The Commission needs to address the equal support rule if support for all carriers 
is  not  going  to  be  based  on  forward-looking  costs.  As  an  interim  step,  the  FCC 
should  require  support  in  rural  study  areas  to  be  based  on  each  ETCs  own  costs, 
capped  at  the  costs  of  the  incumbent  carrier.  While  this  action  may  trim  some  ex-
cess,  it  will  do  little  to  address  the  runaway  growth  of  the  Fund  which  is  caused 
by  supporting  multiple  ETCs  in  high-cost  areas.  The  high-cost  fund  can  be  placed 
on  a  sustainable  basis  only  by  limiting  the  amount  of  support  available  for  each 
high-cost area, and (1) requiring the ETCs to compete for the limited amount of sup-
port,  or  (2)  limiting  the  support  to  only  one  ETC  within  each  area.  The  first  option 
would place the decision on which carrier wins the subsidy in the hands of the cus-
tomer. The second option would require a regulatory authority to determine winners 
and  losers  among  ETCs.  This  could  be  accomplished  through  a  reverse  auction 
mechanism. 

Question  2.  Section  254(c)  of  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  defines  Uni-
versal  Service  as  ‘‘an  evolving  level  of  telecommunications  services’’  and  also  sets 
forth criteria that the FCC considers when it decides which services qualify as ‘‘sup-
ported  services’’  eligible  for  Universal  Service  support.  At  present,  it  is  my  under-
standing  that  the  Universal  Service  Fund  does  not  support  broadband  service.  But 
then,  the  question  always  arises—should  it?  And  if  so,  when?  Do  you  think  that 
Universal  Service  should  evolve  to  support  broadband  services,  and  if  so,  what 
would trigger such a determination? 

Question 2a. Given that the law defines Universal Service as an evolving level of 
‘‘telecommunications  services’’  and  given  that  the  FCC  has  classified  cable  modem 
and  DSL  services  as  ‘‘information  services,’’  would  the  Congress  need  to  change  the 
statute to make broadband eligible for support? 

Answer.  Section  254(c)(1)  sets  forth  the  criteria  which  the  Joint  Board  must  con-
sider in determining whether to add services to the definition of ‘‘universal service.’’ 

1 See, In re: Federal State Joint Board on Universal Service, CC Docket No. 96–45, ‘‘First Re-
port  &  Order’’  (May  7,  1997),  ¶¶ 223;  273;  293–295.  Larger  non-rural  carriers  were  to  be  moved 
to model-determined support first, followed later by smaller rural carriers. 

2 Access  replacement  support  is  provided  by  the  Interstate  Access  Support  mechanism  for 
price cap carriers and Interstate Common Line Support mechanism for rate of return and aver-
age schedule carriers. These two mechanisms paid out $1.95 billion in support in 2006. The FCC 
has never explained how it will transition away from these embedded cost mechanisms. 

3 See, 47 C.F.R. §§ 36.601 et seq. 
4 In some instances wireless carriers were already providing wireless service without a subsidy 
for  many  years.  Upon  becoming  an  ETC,  the  wireless  carrier  is  showered  with  support  dollars 
simply for serving the customers that the carrier was already serving. In these cases, high-cost 
support to wireless ETCs is truly ‘‘found money.’’

One of the most important of these criteria is that the service has ‘‘through the op-
eration of market choices by customers, been subscribed to by a substantial majority 
of  residential  customers.’’ 6 The  last  time  the  Joint  Board  considered  adding 
broadband to the list of supported services in 2002, only 7 percent of residential cus-
tomers  actually  subscribed  to  broadband.7 According  to  the  FCC’s  latest  report  on 
advanced services, 43.6 percent of residential customers subscribed to broadband as 
of  June  30,  2006.8 I  believe  that  residential  subscribership  to  broadband  has  now 
passed 50 percent, and it is time for the Joint Board to once again consider adding 
broadband  to  the  list  of  supported  services.  However,  there  may  be  statutory  im-
pediments  to  taking  this  action,  as  discussed  in  the  answer  to  the  next  question. 
Answer.  Obviously,  Section  254  is  not  a  model  of  clear  draftsmanship.  Section 
254(c)(1)  states:  ‘‘Universal  service  is  an  evolving  level  of  telecommunications  serv-
ices that the Commission shall establish periodically under this section, taking into 
account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services.’’ 
I believe the clear intent of Congress was to allow the definition of Universal Serv-
ice  to  expand  to  include  broadband  when  broadband  services  become  a  widespread 
and  essential  part  of  the  national  telecommunications  landscape.  However,  because 
the FCC has defined cable, wireline and wireless broadband services as ‘‘information 
services’’  with  a  ‘‘telecommunications  component,’’ 9 broadband  may  not  qualify  for 
inclusion in the definition of Universal Service since it is not a ‘‘telecommunications 
service’’ as required by the current wording of Section 254(c)(1). 

In  Section  706  of  the  Act,  the  term  ‘‘advanced  telecommunications  capability’’  is 
defined as ‘‘high-speed, switched, broadband telecommunications capability that en-
ables  users  to  originate  and  receive  high-quality  voice,  data,  graphics,  and  video 
telecommunications using any technology.’’ In the Second Report on Advanced Serv-
ices the FCC defined ‘‘advanced telecommunications capability’’ and ‘‘advanced serv-
ices’’ as services providing transmission speeds of more than 200 kilobits per second 
in  both  directions  (upstream  and  downstream).10 The  FCC’s  usage  of  the  term  ‘‘ad-
vanced services’’ has generally been synonymous with the term ‘‘broadband.’’ 

The  linkage  of  Universal  Service  to  advanced  services  is  obvious  in  the  wording 
of the Act. Section 254(b)(2) states: ‘‘Access to advanced telecommunications and in-
formation services should be provided in all regions of the Nation.’’ Section 254(b)(3) 
states: ‘‘Customers in all regions of the Nation, including low-income consumers and 
those  in  rural,  insular,  and  high-cost  areas,  should  have  access  to  telecommuni-
cations  and  information  services,  including  interexchange  services  and  advanced 
telecommunications  and  information  services,  that  are  reasonably  comparable  to 
those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are rea-
sonably  comparable  to  rates  charged  for  similar  services  in  urban  areas.’’  Section 
254(b)(6) states: ‘‘Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, healthcare pro-
viders, and libraries should have access to advanced telecommunications services as 
described in subsection (h) of this subsection.’’ 11 

The  above-quoted  portions  of  Section  254  appear  to  give  the  FCC  sufficient  au-
thority  to  support  advanced  services.  In  fact,  advanced  services  are  currently  sup-
ported  under  both  the  Schools  &  Libraries  Fund  and  the  Rural  Health  Care  Fund 
of the USF, even though advanced services or broadband are not currently included

in  the  definition  of  ‘‘universal  service.’’  While  an  argument  could  be  made  that 
broadband  can  be  supported  under  the  current  language  of  Section  254,  to  remove 
all doubt it may be necessary to amend Section 254(c)(1) as follows: ‘‘Universal serv-
ice  is  an  evolving  level  of  telecommunications  and  information  services  that  the 
Commission  shall  establish  periodically  under  this  section,  taking  into  account  ad-
vances in telecommunications and information technologies and services.’’ (New lan-
guage in italics.) 

Question 3. Currently the wireless eligible telecommunications carriers (ETCs) re-
ceive  Universal  Service  support  on  a  ‘‘per  customer’’  basis  based  on  the  ‘‘per  line’’ 
costs  of  the  wireline  carrier  in  the  same  geographic  area.  This  is  sometimes  called 
the ‘‘identical support rule’’ and ensures that different communications platform pro-
viders  receive  the  same  amount  of  ‘‘per  line’’  support.  One  criticism  of  the  so-called 
‘‘identical  support  rule’’  for  Universal  Service  is  that  it  results  in  overly  generous 
support  to  wireless  carriers  because  levels  of  support  are  not  based  on  the  per  line 
cost of providing wireless services. As a result, I have two questions—— 

• First,  do  you  believe  that  Universal  Service  should  support  both  wireline  and 

wireless services in rural America? 

Answer.  Please  see  my  response  to  the  first  question  above.  Currently,  both 
wireline  and  wireless  services  are  supported.  During  2006  wireless  ETCs  received 
$1  billion  in  high-cost  support.  As  discussed  above,  the  problem  with  the  current 
system is that it supports all lines of all ETCs in high-cost area without any restric-
tion on the total amount of support and without requiring ETCs to compete for the 
support. The result has been runaway growth of the high-cost fund, from $1.7 billion 
in 1999 to $4.1 billion in 2006. Under either solution to this unsustainable growth— 
competition  among  ETCs  or  limitation  of  support  to  a  single  ETC—wireless  ETCs 
should be allowed to compete on the same basis as wireline incumbent carriers. 

Another  alternative  would  be  to  create  a  separate  wireless  infrastructure  fund, 
similar  to  the  Schools  &  Libraries  Fund,  to  promote  wireless  build-out  in  rural 
areas. Under this approach, a set amount of support would be made available each 
year specifically to subsidize construction of additional wireless tower sites in rural 
areas where such construction is currently uneconomic. Over time, a wireless infra-
structure fund would ensure that customers in rural areas would have access to the 
same level of ubiquitous wireless service as is enjoyed by urban customers. 

Question 3a. Second, would it be possible to construct a model for wireless carriers 
that  would  calculate  support  based  on  costs  of  wireless  carriers,  and  what  effect 
might that have on the size of the fund? 

Answer.  While  it  would  certainly  be  possible  to  construct  a  separate  model  for 
wireless  carriers,  it  would  have  little  impact  on  the  overall  size  of  the  high-cost 
fund.  As  stated  above,  the  main  issue  driving  the  size  of  the  Fund  is  not  equal  per 
line  support,  or  how  that  per  line  support  is  calculated;  it  is  the  fact  that  the  cur-
rent  system  supports  all  lines  of  all  ETCs  in  high-cost  areas.  It  makes  no  sense  to 
subsidize  two,  three  or  more  providers  in  areas  where  costs  are  so  high  that  not 
even a single carrier can provide service without a subsidy. As discussed in answer 
to  the  first  question  above,  support  should  normally  go  to  the  carrier  that  can  pro-
vide  service  in  the  most  cost-effective  manner  in  high-cost  areas,  irrespective  of 
whether  that  carrier  is  a  wireline  carrier  or  a  wireless  carrier.  As  discussed  below, 
one  way  to  get  direct  information  on  different  carriers’  costs  is  head-to-head  com-
petition through reverse auctions. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

HON. BILLY JACK GREGG 

Question  1.  There  has  been  a  lot  of  talk  about  reforming  the  USF  contribution 
assessment system. Much of this discussion has focused on moving toward a ‘‘num-
bers-based’’  system  that  would  assess  a  per-line  fee  on  all  working  telephone  lines. 
Do  you  believe  that  this  could  be  implemented  in  a  way  that  would  not  harm  low- 
volume and low-income telecommunications consumers? 

Answer. No. Any move from a USF contribution system based on usage to a con-
tribution  system  based  on  access  will  inevitably  shift  cost  responsibility  from  high- 
volume  users  of  telecommunications  services  to  low-volume  users.  An  access-based 
contribution  system,  whether  it  uses  numbers  or  connections,  assesses  every  point 
of  access  the  same,  regardless  of  the  amount  of  usage  through  that  point  of  access. 
As  a  result,  a  customer  with  $1,000  of  monthly  usage  through  a  point  of  access 
would pay the same USF contribution as a customer with $0 monthly usage. While 
it  may  be  possible  to  mitigate  the  impact  on  low-usage  customers  by  placing  more

152 

USF  revenue  responsibility  on  high-capacity  data  lines,  the  cost  shift  to  low-usage 
customers cannot be eliminated. 

I believe a better approach to increasing the contribution base would be to remove 
the  current  statutory  restriction  on  assessing  all  revenues.  Section  254(b)(4)  states: 
‘‘All  providers  of  telecommunications  services  should  make  an  equitable  and  non-
discriminatory  contribution  to  the  preservation  and  advancement  of  universal  serv-
ice.’’  However,  Section  254(d)  limits  this  obligation  to  ‘‘Every  telecommunications 
carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services. . . .’’ The Fifth Circuit 
Court of Appeals ruled in 1999 that the statutory language in Section 254(d) limits 
the  FCC  to  assessing  only  interstate  revenues  as  the  basis  for  contributions  to  the 
USF.12 In  2003  the  Joint  Board  forwarded  to  Congress  recommended  language  to 
broaden the FCC’s assessment authority.13 I continue to support that recommenda-
tion.  The  proposed  statutory  changes  to  Section  254(d)  are  as  follows:  ‘‘Notwith-
standing  the  provisions  of  Section  152(b)  of  this  Title,  Eevery  telecommunications 
carrier  that  provides  interstate telecommunications  services  shall  contribute,  on  an 
equitable  and  nondiscriminatory  basis,  to  the  specific,  predictable,  and  sufficient 
mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and advance universal serv-
ice.’’  (Additions  underlined;  deletions  of  existing  language  marked  by  strike- 
throughs.) 

Question 2. The concept of reverse auctions has been widely discussed as one solu-
tion  to  the  problem  of  unchecked  High-Cost  Fund  growth.  How  fast  do  you  believe 
a  reverse  auction  program  could  be  implemented?  Why  is  it  better  than  other  ap-
proaches—such  as  study  area  caps  or  disaggregation?  And,  if  implemented,  what 
sort of savings do you think reverse auctions would provide? 

Answer. A reverse auction program could be implemented rather quickly if it was 
done  in  the  manner  suggested  by  Verizon.14 Verizon  proposes  that  the  high-cost 
fund  first  be  capped  by  study  area,  with  a  separate  cap  for  wireline  and  wireless 
ETCs. Reverse auctions would first be conducted in study areas with multiple wire-
less  ETCs  to  determine  which  single  wireless  ETC  would  receive  support.  Reverse 
auctions  could  later  be  conducted  between  the  wireline  ETC  and  wireless  ETC  in 
each study area (or within subdivisions of the study area) to determine which single 
ETC would receive support. 

As discussed above, reverse auctions would be used in conjunction with study area 
caps to maintain stability in the Fund while the auctions were phased in. Over time, 
reverse  auctions  should  reduce  the  overall  size  of  the  Fund  as  support  for  multiple 
ETCs within the same study area is eliminated. One of the most attractive features 
of auctions is that they allow market forces to be injected into the USF support sys-
tem.  Periodic  reverse  auctions  will  also  capture  changes  in  technologies  and  under-
lying costs over time. 

Savings achieved by auctions in study areas with excessive support could be used 
along with disaggregation to address the issue of the current maldistribution of sup-
port  among  states  and  among  study  areas.  In  other  words,  while  there  are  high- 
cost  areas  which  currently  receive  too  much  support,  such  as  the  example  of  Mis-
sissippi  cited  above,  there  are  other  high-cost  areas  that  receive  no  support.  This 
is usually due to the fact that these high-cost areas are served by non-rural instead 
of rural incumbent carriers. Updated computer models could determine the forward- 
looking economic cost to serve every area in the United States, irrespective of which 
incumbent  carrier  serves  that  area.  These  disaggregated  costs  could  then  be  used 
as  the  basis  for  ‘‘reserve  prices’’  in  future  auctions.15 Reserve  prices  could  be  ad-
justed to fit whatever total amount of support is available. 

Question  3.  Can  reverse  auctions  be  implemented  in  a  manner  that  is  truly  com-
petitively  and  technologically  neutral?  Wouldn’t  such  a  plan  inevitably  mandate 
technology-based ‘‘winners’’ and ‘‘losers?’’ 

Answer.  By  its  very  nature,  a  reverse  auction  will  be  competitive  and  will  inevi-
tably determine winners and losers of the explicit USF subsidy for serving high-cost 
areas.  If  price  is  the  only  criteria  considered  in  a  reverse  auction,  then  the  auction 
process  will  favor  those  technologies  with  the  lowest  cost  structures.  This  would 
tend to favor wireless carriers in most parts of the Nation. However, in any reverse 
auction  the  determination  of  the  criteria  that  all  bidders  must  meet  is  critical. 
Under Section 214(e) of the Act, an ETC must be able to deliver all of the supported 
services  throughout  the  designated  area.  This  may  be  difficult  to  achieve  for  many

wireless  carriers,  especially  those  that  have  not  built  out  their  networks  in  rural 
areas.  This  is  why  I  suggested  above  that  a  separate  rural  wireless  infrastructure 
fund  may  be  the  most  appropriate  way  to  ensure  the  build  out  of  wireless  service 
to all parts of our Nation. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

DAVID CROTHERS 

Question.  There  is  a  proposal  before  the  FCC  to  restrain  the  growth  of  the  Uni-
versal Service Fund by using ‘‘reverse auctions.’’ Under this proposal, carriers would 
bid  for  the  right  to  provide  service  in  a  given  service  area,  for  a  given  time  with 
the  entity  making  the  lowest  bid  winning  the  right  to  receive  support.  While  I  ap-
preciate  the  benefits  of  reverse  auctions,  I  also  worry  about  potential  costs  like 
lower  service  quality  in  rural  areas,  and  the  potential  for  creating  ‘‘stranded  costs’’ 
for auction losers that might harm access to capital. 

to attract private investment from capital markets? 

• What effect would the possibility of losing support have on the ability of carriers

• What effect would reverse auctions have on those providers that fail to win sup-

port and their ability to roll out new services in rural America? 

Answer.  Senator,  the  North  Dakota  Association  of  Telecommunications  Coopera-
tives  (NDATC),  the  National  Telecommunications  Cooperative  Association  (NTCA) 
and the universe of rural communications providers that are members of these two 
organizations  certainly  share  your  concerns  with  regard  to  the  general  concept  of 
reverse  auctions  for  the  primary  reason  that  they  most  certainly  would  lead  to 
stranded investment, placing systems that were built with Universal Service dollars 
and  Federal  Rural  Utilities  Service  loans  at  great  risk  of  failure.  Indeed,  last  Octo-
ber,  NTCA  commissioned  a  review  of  the  subject  of  using  reverse  auctions  to  dis-
tribute  Universal  Service  support  which  concluded  that  moving  in  this  direction 
with  regard  to  areas  with  existing  infrastructure  and  ubiquitous  service  would  be 
a  serious  mistake.  The  paper  prepared  by  Alaska  Pacific  University  Professor  Dale 
E.  Lehman  demonstrates  the  difficulties  and  dangers  and  inherent  issues  in  apply-
ing reverse auctions in areas with existing infrastructure. Based on Lehman’s find-
ings,  correctly  designing  and  implementing  an  effective  reverse  auction  mechanism 
for rural markets will prove tremendously challenging, if not impossible. 

According  to  the  comments,  while  reverse  auctions  may  be  an  appealing  theo-
retical concept, their practical application is fraught with uncertainty and risk. Ad-
ditionally, a reverse auction would be time and labor intensive, prohibitively expen-
sive,  and  technically  burdensome.  The  cost  of  administering  the  reverse  auctions, 
preventing  fraud,  and  monitoring  the  results  would  ultimately  increase  the  size  of 
the  Universal  Service  Fund  and  could  outweigh  any  potential  benefits  gained  from 
the process according to the author. 

With  regard  to  your  specific  question  of  what  effect  the  possibility  of  losing  sup-
port via an auction process would have on a carriers ability to attract private invest-
ment,  we  believe  it  is  undeniable  that  the  impact  would  be  dramatic.  For  the  Na-
tion’s  smallest  carriers  the  impact  would  be  particularly  devastating.  Today,  policy 
modifications,  or  even  the  potential  of  such  modifications  is  turning  our  industry’s 
cost  recovery  ability  and  stability  on  its  head.  Rural  carriers  have  traditionally  not 
been  of  a  size  that  they  are  able  to  attract  the  interest  of  capital  markets  either 
nationally or locally. This is why Universal Service is so important to rural carriers. 
It is a cost recovery source, but it is also a necessary revenue stream that is essen-
tial to their ability to secure financing from the three primary sources of capital that 
are available to them, the Rural Utilities Service, CoBank, and the Rural Telephone 
Finance Cooperative (RTFC). 

Your question regarding what would happen if a provider wins the auction by bid-
ding too much and then responds later by raising prices or reducing service quality 
is entirely justified. This is a fear that we outlined in our comments to the Federal 
Communications Commission on the subject of reverse auctions. Indeed, it would be 
virtually impossible to prevent this sort of scenario from playing out under a reverse 
auction  system.  And  as  your  question  alludes,  the  real  loser  would  not  be  the  pro-
vider,  but  the  consumer.  Again,  we  think  questions  like  this  raise  such  dramatic 
possibilities  as  to  invalidate  the  concept  from  being  considered  any  further  whatso-
ever. 

Finally, on the matter of what would happen to providers that fail to win support 
under a reverse auction system, the response is very simple. They would quickly fail

and their most rural consumers would be those most hurt by the company’s demise 
because any new carrier would be highly unlikely to extend support beyond the easi-
est  to  reach  consumers  that  reside  within  the  town  or  community  itself.  There  are 
reasons  why  the  Universal  Service  policy  has  evolved  in  the  manner  it  has  to  best 
serve rural markets and that is because they simply cannot be squeezed into an eco-
nomic  theory  and  be  expected  to  work.  During  the  extensive  debate  leading  to  the 
development of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, NTCA and its Rural Telephone 
Coalition partners, OPASTCO and WTA prepared and widely circulated a report ti-
tled Rural Is Different. While its underlying message was so simple and so obvious, 
it  was  amazing  at  how  hard  we  had  to  work  to  convince  policymakers  of  its  truth. 
Sadly it appears that only 10 years later, many of your colleagues have already for-
gotten the reality of this message. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

DAVID CROTHERS 

Question  1.  Is  a  reverse  auction  process  the  best  way  to  reduce  overall  Fund 
growth? What do members of the panel think of other options, such as breaking up 
(or disaggregating) study areas to target funds to areas that are truly ‘‘High-Cost?’’ 
Answer. Absolutely not! And we have been stating this fact ad-nausea for the past 
decade.  Frankly  Senator,  NDATC,  NTCA,  and  their  hundreds  of  members  cannot 
comprehend  the  reluctance  of  policymakers,  either  here  on  Capitol  Hill,  or  at  the 
Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  to  look  to  and  apply  the  most  obvious 
and  simple  remedies  that  would  easily  control  the  growth  of  the  Universal  Service 
Fund. Repeatedly we have suggested four ideas to accomplish this objective: 

1. Apply a meaningful public interest test when considering future eligible tele-
communications carrier (ETC) designations; 
2.  Eliminate  the  identical  support  rule  that  today  provides  support  to  competi-
tors based on an incumbent’s costs; 
3. Provide alternative cost-based support to rural wireless ETCs; and, 
4.  Expand  the  base  of  USF  contributors  to  include  all  broadband  service  pro-
viders. 

Implementing  this  simple  four  pronged  plan  would  immediately  stem  the  flow  of 
Universal  Service  dollars  and  restore  the  confidence  of  all  Americans  in  this  time- 
tested cornerstone of our national communications policy. 

Question  2.  If  we  move  to  a  reverse  auction  process,  isn’t  there  a  possibility  that 
some providers may bid so low that they end up financially unable to provide serv-
ice?  Furthermore,  if  an  ‘‘auction  winner’’  went  bankrupt,  how  can  we  be  sure  that 
households in that area continue to receive service? 

Answer.  Sir,  these  are  exactly  the  sorts  of  questions  we  posed  in  our  filings  to 
the  FCC  and  in  the  Lehman  paper  referenced  in  our  response  to  Senator  Inouye’s 
questions  on  this  subject.  That  paper  was  formally  filed  with  the  hearing  record  of 
this  committee.  At  any  rate,  we  think  this  is  the  sort  of  gamesmanship  that  could 
easily take place under the reverse auction scenario. At the very time when so many 
of  your  colleagues  appear  to  be  concerned  about  waste,  fraud,  and  abuse  with  this 
or  any  other  Federal  oriented  program,  we  think  it  would  be  unjustified  to  move 
in the direction of a concept such as this that sounds interesting in theory but falls 
apart immediately when looked at as a serious option. And of course you are right— 
consumers would be the ultimate losers in this scenario. Certainly, if the incumbent 
carrier had lost the auction to a low bidder, our viewpoint would be that the incum-
bent  no  longer  has  a  responsibility  of  carrier  of  last  resort  obligations  because  they 
would not have the financial resources to make such a commitment. And, the entity 
that submitted the unrealistically low bid would be unable to fulfill the commitment 
as well, so there really would not be a good option for consumers in such a situation. 
That is why we believe reverse actions have no place in this discussion.

for  auction  losers  that  might  harm  access  to  capital.  What  effect  would  the  possi-
bility  of  losing  support  have  on  the  ability  of  carriers  to  attract  private  investment 
from capital markets? 

Answer.  Telecom  networks  are  highly  capital-intensive  to  operate,  particularly  in 
rural  areas,  and  investors  seek  a  commensurate  level  of  security  to  offset  the  risk 
associated with the costs of network investments over time. In markets that are oth-
erwise uneconomical to serve, Universal Service support is an important part of that 
cost recovery. Less certainty over the continued receipt of Universal Service support 
will  translate  into  a  higher  cost  of  capital  for  telecom  operators.  In  the  case  of  re-
verse  auctions,  that  uncertainty  would  have  to  be  addressed  by  rules  that  ensure 
support will be specific, predictable and sufficient. 

Question  1a.  What  would  happen  if  a  provider  wins  the  auction  by  bidding  too 

much, and then responds later by raising prices or reducing service quality? 

Answer.  Ensuring  appropriate  network  investment,  service  quality  and  com-
parability of pricing is a challenge facing any reform of Universal Service programs. 
In  the  case  of  reverse  auctions,  we  assume  participants  would  be  bidding  to  (at 
least) meet minimum requirements in each of these categories, as well as living up 
to  the  carrier-of-last-resort  (COLR)  requirements  currently  imposed  on  the  incum-
bent  carrier.  We  also  assume  there  would  have  to  be  a  failsafe  mechanism  to  pre-
vent a winning bidder from defaulting on those requirements. 

Question 1b. What effect would reverse auctions have on those providers that fail 

to win support and their ability to roll out new services in rural America? 

Answer.  For  the  rural  areas  that  are  truly  uneconomic  to  serve,  the  withdrawal 
of support would lead to a substantial elimination of new investment and likely dis-
continuance  of  services  by  those  providers,  because  the  ability  to  recover  costs  and 
earn  a  reasonable  economic  return  on  investment  would  no  longer  be  there.  While 
some rural town centers might continue to receive service from a carrier that failed 
to  win  support,  those  in  the  outlying  areas  would  have  to  rely  on  the  provider  that 
did  win  support  for  service,  and  it  would  only  be  fair  to  transfer  the  carrier  of  last 
resort (COLR) requirement to the new provider (which would ultimately require co-
operation with, or preemption of state authorities). For this reason, it is very impor-
tant to target support to the geographic areas that need it the most. 

Question  2.  Dr.  Staihr,  I  was  interested  in  your  testimony  arguing  that  support 
should  be  provided  on  a  more  granular  basis.  Is  this  type  of  granular  analysis  ad-
ministratively feasible and what steps would the FCC need to take to institute such 
a model? 

Answer.  Especially  in  recent  years,  with  advancement  in  computing  technologies, 
mapping software and the online availability of free mapping information, a granu-
lar analysis has become administratively feasible. Embarq has demonstrated this to 
its  satisfaction  by  performing  granular  analysis  on  some  of  our  serving  areas  for 
proof-of-concept  purposes,  and  it  was  affirmed  by  two  other  witnesses  at  the  Feb-
ruary 20, 2007 en banc hearing of the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Serv-
ice. In an April 12 filing to the Joint Board, Embarq outlined 5 steps that the FCC 
could take to gather the information necessary for such a model: 

1. Collect population density data from companies choosing to submit such data 
for study purposes; 
2.  Validate  the  population  density  data  using  Census  data  and  establish  the 
need for granular analysis; 
3.  Collect  customer  location  data  from  the  companies  that  qualify  for  granular 
analysis; 
4. Select a suitable model for estimating cost of service; and 
5. Identify the high-cost areas at a granular level using the selected model and 
submitted data. 

These  steps  are  explained  in  more  detail,  beginning  on  page  160  of  our  ex  parte 
presentation,  which  I’ve  attached,  and  we  would  be  happy  to  discuss  our  proposal 
in further detail at your convenience. 

Question 2a. Also, if distributions were made on a more granular level, what effect 
would it have on the overall size of the Fund and on the distribution of funds among 
carriers? 

Answer.  Making  distributions  on  a  more  granular  level  would  create  counter-
vailing  pressures  on  the  size  of  the  Universal  Service  Fund.  On  the  one  hand,  an 
appropriately  targeted  fund,  by  dispensing  with  statewide  averaging  for  some  car-
riers,  would  bring  support  to  some  very  rural  areas  that  currently  receive  no  sup-
port at all, replacing unsustainable cross subsidies with explicit support.

At  the  same  time,  considering  town  centers  separately  from  outlying  areas  could 
eliminate many of the most egregious arbitrage and windfall opportunities that are 
causing  the  Fund  to  grow  out  of  control  today.  Ultimately,  the  impact  on  the  Fund 
size  would  depend  on  the  particular  choices  made  in  implementing  more  granular 
targeting.  Eliminating  the  windfall  opportunities  and  supporting  rural  areas  inde-
pendent  of  statewide  averaging  would  create  a  much  more  equitable  distribution 
among carriers and allow universal services distributions to be more closely aligned 
with economic costs. 

Question 2b. What steps would states and/or the FCC need to take to do this kind 

Answer.  Embarq’s  proposed  steps  are  outlined  in  our  ex  parte,  attached  to  this 
document. We have proposed a cooperative system where carriers could share data, 
but USAC could also gather publicly available data on population density and other 
factors affecting network costs.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

BRIAN K. STAIHR, PH.D. 

Question  1.  Is  a  reverse  auction  process  the  best  way  to  reduce  overall  Fund 
growth? What do members of the panel think of other options, such as breaking up 
(or disaggregating) study areas to target funds to areas that are truly ‘‘High-Cost?’’ 
Answer.  I’ve  attached  Embarq’s  April  12  ex  parte  detailing  our  proposal  for  more 
granular  targeting  of  support,  which  has  the  benefit  of  eliminating  some  of  the 
windfall and arbitrage opportunities that are causing the Fund to grow, and ensur-
ing that support flows to the most high-cost areas. 

We  believe  such  granular  targeting  is  an  important  component  of  any  attempt  to 
reform  Universal  Service,  regardless  of  whether  the  FCC  pursues  reverse  auctions, 
provides explicit support for broadband, limits support to one carrier per geographic 
area or addresses many of the other difficult issues at hand. 

After  the  March  1  Commerce  Committee  hearing  and  the  tremendous  focus  on 
support  for  broadband,  we  believe  that  if  Congress  or  the  FCC  made  the  decision 
to  explicitly  support  broadband,  identifying  and  targeting  to  the  most  high-cost 
areas would be an indispensable step to lay the foundations for such a move. 

Question  2.  If  we  move  to  a  reverse  auction  process,  isn’t  there  a  possibility  that 
some providers may bid so low that they end up financially unable to provide serv-
ice?  Furthermore,  if  an  ‘‘auction  winner’’  went  bankrupt,  how  can  we  be  sure  that 
households in that area continue to receive service? 

Answer.  Both  good  points.  We  assume  any  reverse  auction  system  would  have  to 
include a qualification system to ensure that those who bid for support are capable 
of  meeting  the  carrier-of-last-resort  (COLR)  requirements  for  that  area,  and  are  fi-
nancially stable enough to minimize the risk of bankruptcy. In any event, any kind 
of USF reform would need a fail-safe mechanism to ensure that consumers and local 
businesses do not lose service.

RE:  HIGH-COST UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT,  WC  DOCKET 05–337;  FEDERAL-STATE 

JOINT BOARD ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE, CC DOCKET 96–45. 
Dear Commissioner Tate and Commissioner Baum: 
Embarq  strongly  supports  the  substantial  and  continuing  efforts  of  the  Federal- 
State Joint Board on Universal Service (the Joint Board) to reform the Federal Uni-
versal Service Fund (USF) so it may better advance the Universal Service goals set 
forth  in  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996.  Telecommunications  markets  have 
changed substantially in the decade since the current Federal USF was created and, 
accordingly,  substantial  reform  is  necessary  to  accomplish  those  goals.  To  this  end, 
the Joint Board can best ensure that USF reform fulfills the statutory goals for Uni-
versal Service by recommending that the Federal Communications Commission:

1. Focus on correcting the structural problems caused by the multiplicity of sup-
port recipients and the misallocation of support; 
2. Stabilize the current system of Universal Service support; 
3. Limit the duration of a freeze or cap so as to make it temporary; 
4. Initiate a study to identify the highest-cost areas at a granular level; and 
5. Follow a clear and achievable process to complete the study, and then provide 
support dollars to the areas identified by the study. 

If  the  Joint  Board  recommends  these  steps,  and  the  Commission  adopts  them, 
Federal  USF  will  become  the  ‘‘specific,  predictable  and  sufficient’’ 1 program  called 
for in the statute. Federal USF finally will provide ‘‘explicit’’ 2 support to those high- 
cost areas where it is truly uneconomic to provide service—that is to say where the 
marketplace  conditions  would  not  provide  sufficient  incentives  for  any  carrier  to 
offer  service.  This,  in  turn,  will  ensure  that  ‘‘quality  services  [are]  be  available  at 
just,  reasonable,  and  affordable  rates’’ 3 that  are  that  are  ‘‘reasonably  comparable’’ 
in rural and urban areas.4 
I.  The  Joint  Board  Should  Recommend  Correction  of  the  Structural 
Problems  Caused  by  the  Multiplicity  of  Support  Recipients  and  the 
Misallocation of Support 

There  is  widespread  recognition  that  the  current  USF  suffers  from  significant 
structural problems. In particular, the current USF does not satisfy important stat-
utory  criteria  set  forth  in  Section  254  of  the  Communications  Act.  It  does  not  pro-
vide specific, predictable, and sufficient support in all (or even most) high-cost areas. 
The  Federal  USF  does  not  adequately  preserve  and  advance  universal  service,  and 
it  continues  to  rely  on  implicit  rather  than  explicit  support  through  extensive  use 
of  cost  averaging  in  the  face  of  competition  that  renders  such  an  approach 
unspecific, unpredictable, and insufficient. Finally, the Federal USF does not ensure 
access to supported services at rates that are affordable, reasonable, and comparable 
to rates in urban areas.4 

At  the  outset,  Embarq  emphasizes  that  USF  reform  need  not  impact  many  car-
riers,  such  as  many  small  and  mid-sized,  rural  incumbent  local  exchange  carriers 
(ILECs),  that  are  unaffected  by  the  structural  problems  identified  below.  Indeed, 
these carriers would retain all of their current options under Embarq’s proposals in 
this document, which would not necessarily alter USF treatment for those carriers. 
In  particular,  the  study  to  more  accurately  identify  high-cost  areas  to  support  that 
which  Embarq  proposes  herein  would  be  voluntary  and  any  new  support  provided 
to  previously-overlooked  areas  would  come  directly  from  correcting  the  structural 
problem of duplicative support. The study and related granular targeting of support 
would  not,  therefore,  necessarily  disturb  USF  treatment  of  currently-supported 
ILECs. 

The  record  in  this  docket  contains  hundreds  of  filings,  a  great  many  of  them  de-
tailing the problems and the urgent need for reform, and the Joint Board itself iden-
tified  the  problems  and  the  need  for  reform  at  its  last  en  banc  hearing.5 This  evi-
dence  and  analysis  leads  inexorably  to  the  conclusion  that  the  Joint  Board  should 
recommend,  and  the  Commission  should  promptly  reform  two  critically  important 
structural flaws in Federal USF. 

1.  Duplicative  support  is  being  awarded  to  multiple  competitive  eligible  tele-
communications carriers (CETCs) operating in a single market area. This policy 
has  been  the  primary  source  of  excessive  growth  in  USF  support,  as  noted  by 
Chairman  Martin  and  others.6 The  multiplicity  of  support  and  excessive  USF 
growth  harms  consumers  everywhere  by  increasing  both  the  cost  to  provide 
service and the aggregate demand for USF contributions. 
2. At the same time, however, many of the highest-cost areas—many designated 
as  ‘‘rural’’  and  many  others  designated  as  ‘‘non-rural’’—do  not  receive  ‘‘suffi-
cient’’ high-cost support. This was confirmed by the United States Court of Ap-
peals  for  the  Tenth  Circuit 7 for  the  non-rural  fund,  and  it  is  equally  true  for

many  carriers  that  receive  support  under  the  rural  fund  due  to  the  current 
practice of using averages (on a statewide or study area basis) to determine the 
need for support.8 This failure to direct specific, predictable, and sufficient sup-
port to all areas that are truly uneconomic to serve harms consumers by inhib-
iting network investment in high-cost areas and perpetuating implicit subsidies 
in lower-cost areas. 

The Joint Board can best accomplish its objectives by issuing a Recommended De-
cision  that  focuses  on  steps  to  eliminate  these  structural  flaws.  In  particular, 
Embarq agrees with Windstream that the Joint Board should ‘‘recommend forward- 
looking and rational Universal Service reforms that target adequate explicit support 
to  high-cost  areas.  To  do  otherwise,  would  perpetuate  the 
inequities  and 
insufficiencies  in  the  current  mechanism  to  the  detriment  of  rural  consumers  and 
the  Nation.’’ 9 Moreover,  by  fixing  this  structural  flaw,  the  Commission  can  finally 
comply with statutory mandates and the remand in Qwest v. FCC. 
II.  The  Joint  Board  Should  Recommend  Stabilizing  the  Current  System  of 

Universal Service Support 

The  first  step  to  fixing  the  USF  structural  flaws  is  to  prevent  further  harm,  and 
to  do  so  sooner  rather  than  later.  The  current  growth  in  support,  particularly  in-
creases  that  fund  competition  in  areas  where  it  is  uneconomic  for  a  single  provider 
to  offer  service,  harm  consumers  and  investment.  AT&T  and  Verizon 10 have  each 
recently filed plans addressing this issue. Both of these plans propose that USF re-
form  occur  in  two  stages:  (1)  imposing  a  temporary  freeze  or  cap  on  USF  distribu-
tions to stabilize the system and permit the Commission to address current concerns 
regarding  fund  size,  fund  growth,  and  magnitude  of  contribution  factor;  and  (2)  re-
structuring the method by which USF support is distributed. 

As  the  first  phase  of  a  two-phase  plan,  a  temporary  freeze  or  cap  would  accom-
plish the important goal of immediately eliminating any additional upward pressure 
on the end-user USF assessment, which is currently up to 11.7 percent. For the past 
4  years,  the  overwhelming  majority  of  the  growth  in  high-cost  support  has  been 
driven by growth in wireless receipts while wireline receipts having stayed constant 
or declined.11 This has happened because wireline support has long been subject to 
a  cap.  Therefore,  the  most  direct  and  narrowly-tailored,  and  competitively-neutral 
approach  to  the  problem  is  to  address  wireless  support  during  this  interim  period. 
Given  that  the  purpose  and  justification  for  a  temporary  freeze  or  cap  is  to  sup-
port longterm reform, it is critical that the freeze or cap be accompanied by a study 
to  identify  the  truly  high-cost  areas  in  the  United  States.  The  Joint  Board  should 
recommend, therefore, that the Commission conduct such a study during the course 
of  a  temporary  freeze  or  cap.  The  public  interest  is  best  served  through  informed 
decisionmaking,  which  can  only  be  helped  through  a  study  of  the  cost  of  providing 
service.  In  fact,  this  information  is  vital  to  any  reform  the  Commission  may  con-
sider, as explained below. A temporary freeze or cap will help ensure that the study 
results  are  relevant  (the  freeze  or  cap  will  help  maintain  the  conditions  that  will 
be revealed through study) and accurate (the freeze or cap will help minimize gam-
ing). 

All  other  things  being  equal,  a  temporary  freeze  would  be  preferable  to  a  cap  in 
economic  terms  since  it  ensures  that  no  individual  recipient  would  be  made  any 
worse  off  or  any  better  off  as  a  direct  result  of  the  freeze  during  the  interim  time-
frame.  Conversely,  a  cap  on  funds  may  allow  for  the  possibility  of  individual  win-
ners  and  losers  underneath  the  cap  as  relative  support  amounts  continue  to  be  ad-
justed. This would be undesirable from a policy perspective as it would make study 
results less accurate and relevant to the Commission’s objectives. 
III.  The  Joint  Board  Should  Recommend  That  Any  Freeze  or  Cap  Be 

Temporary 

There  are,  of  course,  some  risks  involved  in  implementing  any  type  of  freeze  or 
cap;  one  being  the  natural  tendency  to  apply  a  temporary  remedy  and  then  act  as 
if  the  problem  has  been  solved.  The  Joint  Board  must  emphasize,  therefore,  that

any  temporary  freeze  or  cap  is  a  means  to  an  end,  rather  than  an  end  in  and  of 
itself.  Accordingly,  Embarq  agrees  with  AT&T  when  it  proposes  strict  time  limita-
tions—a  maximum  of  2  years—on  the  duration  of  any  freeze  or  cap.12 A  freeze  or 
cap of any longer duration would only perpetuate the implicit subsidies that plague 
the current USF.13 

The  Commission  has  the  authority  to  impose  a  temporary  freeze  or  cap,  particu-
larly  in  a  case  like  this  where  the  Commission  requires  market  stability  while  it 
studies where and how to best allocate USF support to the high-cost areas that most 
need it. The implementation of a temporary freeze or cap on USF support is logical 
because  it  is  imperative  that  the  Joint  Board  and  the  Commission  address  the  un-
derlying  structural  problems  that  are  inherent  in  the  current  USF  system.  A  tem-
porary  freeze  or  cap  will  provide  the  Joint  Board  and  Commission  with  the  nec-
essary  stability  and  time  needed  to  accomplish  this  structural  reform  in  a  manner 
that  ensures  the  ongoing  sufficiency,  specificity  and  predictability  of  the  Federal 
mechanism. 

The Commission enjoys considerable discretion to adopt interim rules while it un-
dertakes  long-term  changes  to  its  regulations.  This  is  particularly  so  where  the  in-
terim rules merely ‘‘maintain the status quo so that the objectives of a pending rule-
making proceeding will not be frustrated.’’ 14 In the case of USF reform, a temporary 
freeze or cap is particularly appropriate given the rapid increases in overall support 
and the substantial changes in support levels for individual carriers, including sub-
stantial  decreases  in  support  for  some  carriers.  As  the  United  States  Court  of  Ap-
peals for the District of Columbia Circuit has explained, ‘‘[a]voidance of [such] mar-
ket  disruption  pending  broader  reforms  is,  of  course,  a  standard  and  accepted  jus-
tification for a temporary rule.’’ 15 
IV.  The  Joint  Board  Should  Recommend  a  Study  To  Identify  the  Highest- 

Cost Areas at a Granular Level 

During the course of a temporary freeze or cap, the Commission will be in a posi-
tion  to  undertake  a  detailed  study  that  will  identify  the  best  means  for  addressing 
the  structural  problems  identified  above.  Windstream  is  correct  when  it  observes 
that  the  public  interest  will  not  be  served  by  perpetuating  the  current  system, 
which  is  rife  with  inequities  and  logical  failings.  Therefore,  the  Joint  Board  should 
recommend solutions for both structural problems discussed above—duplicative sup-
port in some areas and inadequate support in others. One approach to solving both 
problems would be to direct support freed up by fixing the duplicative support prob-
lem toward fixing the inadequate support problem. 

As described at length during the Joint Board’s recent en banc on universal serv-
ice,  the  ability  to  accurately  identify  high-cost  areas  at  a  very  granular  level  has 
reached a level of precision that was unimaginable only a few years ago.16 Through 
a  combination  of  advances  in  modeling,  better  data,  and  ever-increasing  computing 
power the Commission has at its disposal a set of tools capable of producing a study 
to ensure that all high-cost areas that truly require explicit support are adequately 
supported.  This  is  in  stark  contrast  to  the  data  and  modeling  capability  that  was 
available  nearly  10  years  ago,  when  the  Commission  and  Joint  Board  first  consid-
ered using a study to determine USF needs. 

A  study  would  support,  and  would  be  a  necessary  precondition  to  implementing 
a  proposal  like,  AT&T’s.  AT&T  states  as  much  in  its  ex  parte  presentation  where 
it wrote that, in order to ensure sufficiency of support to all high-cost areas—includ-
ing areas that do not currently receive high-cost support due to averaging—it is nec-
essary to determine the need for support at a more granular level (‘‘. . . in narrower 
geographic areas, such as wire centers or Census Block Groups’’).17 The Joint Board 
should  recommend  this  be  done  by  undertaking  a  comprehensive  study  that  more 
accurately identifies high-cost areas at a wire center or sub-wire center level. 

A  study  would  also  facilitate  and  accelerate  the  implementation  of  any  rec-
ommendation  along  the  lines  of  a  proposal  like  Verizon’s.  Should  the  Commission 
ultimately choose auctions as the best mechanism for addressing the problem of du-
plicative  support  awarded  to  multiple  CETCs  in  a  single  area,  it  is  important  that 
the  Commission  identify  the  areas  that  most  need  support.  Conducting  a  study

would  help  the  Commission  avoid  many  of  the  uncertainties  and  risks  inherent  in 
using  an  untested  approach  such  as  reverse  auctions  to  determine  which  areas 
would  be  in  need  of  support.  The  structural  problems  with  the  current  USF  make 
it  a  poor  guide  for  identifying  the  right  areas  to  support.  Moreover,  it  is  important 
to  understand  the  costs  of  serving  areas  on  a  granular  level  in  order  to  correctly 
size  the  individual  auction  areas.  Therefore,  a  granular  understanding  of  which 
areas  are  truly  high-cost  is  essential  to  ensure  that  the  areas  to  be  ‘‘bid’’  on  in  any 
auctions are those that best serve the public interest and fulfill the objectives of the 
Communications Act. 

In  sum,  a  granular  study  would  facilitate  any  long-term  USF  solution,  and  it 
would do no harm. Moreover, a granular study identifying the truly high-cost areas 
to  serve  will  also  produce  the  information  needed  by  the  Joint  Board  and  Commis-
sion to evaluate future directions for the Federal USF mechanism and for USF pol-
icy  in  general.  For  example,  the  granular  study  would  serve  as  an  effective  tool  for 
identifying  areas  where  it  is  uneconomic  for  the  market  to  deploy  broadband.  The 
Commission’s  long-stated  goal  of  advancing  broadband  deployment—whether  as  a 
supported service or not—requires a comprehensive understanding of the geographic 
hurdles  (density,  distance,  absence  of  critical  mass  of  consumers)  and  incremental 
investment  needs  that  currently  providers  face  as  they  bring  advanced  services  to 
the most rural, high-cost areas. 
V. The Commission Should Follow a Clear and Achievable Process To Study 
High-Cost  Areas,  and  Then  Provide  Support  Dollars  to  the  Areas 
Identified by the Study 

The  actual  process  for  conducting  a  study  to  identify  high-cost  areas  in  need  of 
USF  support  is  clear  and  achievable.  First,  Embarq  proposes  that  the  Commission 
should maintain the support rules for companies that choose not to submit data for 
a  study.  Then,  the  Commission  should  follow  a  five-step  process  to  study  high-cost 
areas  and  identify  new  areas  that  should  receive  support.  Finally,  the  Commission 
should use study results to direct adequate support to the newly-identified high-cost 
areas. 
A. The Commission Should Maintain the Support Rules for Companies That Choose 

Not To Submit Data for a Study 

Embarq proposes that ETCs have the option not to participate in the study. Such 
ETCs would continue to receive support as they do today. They would, however, re-
main  subject  to  any  applicable  reforms,  such  as  auctions  (which  may  only  apply  to 
a subset of ETCs under some of the proposals before the Joint Board). It is also im-
portant to note that a solution to this structural problem concerns identifying which 
areas  should  receive  support  and  directing  to  those  areas  the  support  that  is  cur-
rently misallocated due to the first structural flaw discussed above—supporting du-
plicative ETCs. The question of which carriers should receive support and how that 
support is to be calculated will be resolved in these new areas using the same meth-
odologies  that  are  chosen  for  currently-supported  areas.  In  particular,  ILEC  costs 
are used to identify high-cost areas today, and the study would follow this approach. 
B.  The  Commission  Should  Follow  a  Five-Step  Process  To  Study  High-Cost  Areas 

and Identify New Areas That Should Receive Support 

The  Joint  Board  should  recommend  that  the  Commission  determine  that  cost  of 
service is directly related to population density, and that study-area averaging masks 
wide variations in the true cost of service. In general, low density translates to high- 
cost. Because all network technologies (even wireless) exhibit economies of scale and 
economies  of  density,  there  is  a  strong  inverse  relationship  between  cost  and  cus-
tomer density. This relationship can be used to begin the process of accurately iden-
tifying high-cost areas. Many study areas exhibit a large degree of variation in den-
sity,  which  translates  to  a  large  degree  of  variation  in  costs.  The  current  system  of 
using study area averages masks this variation in costs within a single study area. 
In particular, the assumption that costs can be averaged is no longer valid because 
of  competition  in  low-cost  areas,  which  prevents  companies  from  realizing  greater 
margins  in  those  areas  and  using  those  returns  to  support  below-cost  service  in 
high-cost areas. 

The  actual  process  for  completing  such  a  study  is  relatively  straightforward,  and 
the study can be completed within the two-year time-frame of the freeze or cap. The 
Joint  Board  should,  therefore,  recommend  that  the  Commission  take  the  following 
actions: 

1. Collect population density data from companies choosing to submit such data 
for study purposes; 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00164 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

161 

2.  Validate  the  population  density  data  using  Census  data  and  establish  the 
need for granular analysis; 
3.  Collect  customer  location  data  from  the  companies  that  qualify  for  granular 
analysis; 
4. Select a suitable model for estimating cost of service; and 
5. Identify the high-cost areas at a granular level using the selected model and 
submitted data. 

1.  Collect  population  density  data  from  companies  choosing  to  submit  such  data 
for  study  purposes.  In  the  first  phase,  if  a  company  believes  that  the  use  of  study 
area  averaging  masks  its  high-cost  areas,  and  therefore  its  need  for  USF  support, 
such  companies  could  choose  to  submit  disaggregated  density  data  (for  example,  by 
wire  center  or  at  a  sub-wire  center  level)  to  the  Universal  Service  Administration 
Company  (USAC).  The  National  Exchange  Carrier  Association  (NECA)  could  also 
submit  data  on  behalf  of  pooling  companies  that  choose  to  participate  but  which 
may  not  feasibly  be  able  to  submit  their  own  data.  The  purpose  of  this  showing 
would be to demonstrate that significant variation in the density of areas served by 
the carrier causes the carrier to experience significant variation in costs.18 

2.  Validate  the  population  density  data  using  Census  data  and  establish  the  need 
for  granular  analysis.  USAC  would  independently  verify  this  data  using  publicly 
available  Census  data  to  determine  whether  the  data  showed  significant  variation 
in  density.  If  so,  the  strong  density/cost  correlation  would  allow  USAC  to  conclude 
that this area exhibited significant variation in costs (regardless of how costs might 
be calculated). The preliminary evaluation would serve as an initial bright-line test 
that  this  company’s  need  for  USF  support  must  be  determined  at  a  more  granular 
level. 

3.  Collect  customer  location  data  from  the  companies  that  qualify  for  granular 
analysis.  At  that  point,  a  company  that  had  initially  submitted  density  data  and 
passed  the  bright-line  test  would  then  have  the  option  of  providing  additional  data 
to  USAC  regarding  wire  center  boundaries  (just  as  it  now  provides  Form  477  data 
at  a  Zip  Code  level).  The  company  would  also  have  the  option  of  submitting  cus-
tomer location data to USAC. Location data could be actual geo-coded locations, bill-
ing addresses, or service addresses.19 This data would remain proprietary and would 
be  held  by  USAC.  It  would  be  combined  with  public  data  (such  as  CB  boundaries, 
road systems) to be used to calculate costs (and ultimately, support). 

4. Select a suitable model for estimating cost of service. Because companies’ actual 
cost  records  do  not  generally  exist  at  granular  levels,  it  will  be  necessary  to  use  a 
model  to  estimate  the  cost  of  providing  service  of  companies  that  choose  to  submit 
the  above-referenced  data.  The  Commission  would  direct  USAC  to  identify  a  model 
that  would  most  accurately  estimate  costs  and  partner  with  the  model’s  developer 
on  an  ongoing  basis  to  ensure  that  the  use  of  the  model  would  achieve  the  goals 
set  forth  by  Congress  for  Universal  Service  support  mechanisms.  Models  are  cur-
rently  available  that  are  capable  of  producing  cost  estimates  for  the  entire  country 
at  an  extremely  precise  level,  such  as  a  single  census  block  (CB)  as  identified  by 
the  U.S.  Census  Bureau.  To  attain  the  level  of  accuracy  necessary,  the  model  must 
incorporate—to  the  greatest  extent  possible—real-world  engineering  practices  and 
real-world network characteristics (such as road systems), as well as geo-coded cus-
tomer locations into its forward-looking costing methodology. 

5.  Identify  the  high-cost  areas  at  a  granular  level  using  the  selected  model  and 
submitted  data.  To  determine  which  areas  are  uneconomic  to  serve  and  therefore 
require support, the company-provided data (combined with publicly available data) 
would  be  input  into  the  selected  model.  Costs  would  be  calculated  and  then  pro-
duced at a level below the study area level to maintain a reasonable degree of gran-
ularity.  Results  would  initially  be  produced  at  the  individual  wire  center  level, 
which would yield an independently-identified list of high-cost wire centers that are 

18 Until  and  unless  a  rule  change  is  implemented  that  wireless  carriers  would  receive  USF 
support based on something other than ILEC costs there would be no need for wireless carriers 
to  submit  data.  If  such  a  change  is  made,  competitive  ETCs  could,  at  their  own  choosing,  also 
submit density data regarding their designated service areas (which in many cases mirror exist-
ing study areas.) 

19 Since wireless recipients are already required to provide ‘‘line’’ counts to USAC at the wire 
center  level  all  wireless  companies  that  are  USF  recipients  already  have  the  capability  of  pro-
viding  their  customers’  locations  ‘‘by  wire  center’’  even  though  they  themselves  do  not  operate 
a  network  based  on  the  concept  of  wire  centers,  if  such  a  rule  change  occurred  as  described  in 
the footnote above.

currently  masked  by  the  averaging  process.20 This  would  give  the  Commission  an 
accurate  compilation  of  high-cost  areas—in  some  cases  entire  study  areas,  in  some 
cases individual wire centers (or possibly zones)—all of which are truly uneconomic 
to serve and therefore in need of explicit support. 
C.  The  Commission  Should  Use  Study  Results  To  Direct  Adequate  Support  to  the 

Newly-Identified High-Cost Areas 

Upon completion of the study, the Commission would still need to determine how 
to  provide  adequate  support  to  high-cost  areas  that  are  not  currently  receiving  it. 
In  particular,  the  Commission  would  likely  want  to  consider  how  support  could  be 
provided to these areas without significantly increasing the size of USF. In the short 
term the Commission could implement a pilot program to begin providing some level 
of  support  to  the  highest-cost  wire  centers  that  had  been  identified  by  the  study; 
wire  centers  where  the  need  for  explicit  support  has  been  masked  by  the  use  of 
study area averages. Funding for this support could come, for example, from AT&T’s 
proposal  for  a  25  percent  reduction  in  wireless  receipts  from  the  IAS  and  ICLS 
funds.21 

In the longer term, the answer can be found through a solution to the first struc-
tural  problem  listed  above—that  of  duplicative  support  going  to  multiple  ETCs  in 
a single geographic area. To the extent the Commission undertakes action to reduce 
the number of recipients in an area—and thereby reduce the dollars flowing to those 
redundant ETCs—the existing support dollars that are ‘‘freed up’’ can be distributed 
to  the  newly  identified  high-cost  areas  using  the  cost  of  providing  service  and  an 
appropriate revenue benchmark. 
VI. Conclusion 

In conclusion, the Joint Board can best ensure that USF reform serves the public 
interest and benefits consumers by recommending that the Federal Communications 
Commission:  (a)  focus  on  correcting  the  structural  problems  caused  by  the  multi-
plicity  of  support  recipients  and  the  misallocation  of  support;  (b)  stabilize  the  cur-
rent  system  of  Universal  Service  support;  (c)  limit  the  duration  of  a  freeze  or  cap 
so  as  to  make  it  temporary;  (d)  initiate  a  study  to  identify  the  highest-cost  areas 
at  a  granular  level;  and  (e)  follow  a  clear  and  achievable  process  to  complete  the 
study,  and  then  provide  support  dollars  to  the  areas  identified  by  the  study. 
Through this process, the Commission will accomplish all of its goals; it will: 

• Eliminate redundant, duplicative support; 
• Control fund growth; and 
• Identify  accurately  and  direct  support  to  all  high-cost  areas,  including  those 
that  have  been  overlooked  because  of  the  Commission’s  study-area  averaging 
approach.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

RICHARD N. MASSEY 

General Comments On Recent Joint Board Recommendation 

The  Joint  Board  recently  adopted  a  Recommended  Decision  proposing  a  ‘‘cap’’  on 
funding  to  competitive  ETCs,  while  continuing  to  ensure  that  ILECs  receive  every 
dollar  that  is  currently  disbursed  to  them.  The  Joint  Board’s  proposal  would  cut 

20 A carrier could also request the calculation of an added level of granularity. In many cases 
there  is  significant  cost  variation  within  a  single  wire  center,  as  described  in  Embarq’s  many 
filings  in  this  docket.  This  variation  can  be  masked  by  the  wire  center’s  average  cost,  just  as 
wire-center-level  variation  often  is  masked  within  a  study  area  average.  A  carrier  requesting 
increased granularity could request that the model’s results (which would have been calculated 
by  that  time)  be  disaggregated  to  a  more  granular  level,  such  as  zones  within  a  wire  center. 
This would be a very simple procedure because the actual model processing operates even more 
granularly.  For  a  company  that  requested  additional  granularity,  the  CB  level  costs  could  be 
aggregated  up  to  (for  example)  an  inner-  and  outer-zone  per  wire  center,  based  on  contiguous 
CBs above-or-below a certain density. The result, in this case, would be an independently-identi-
fied  list  of  high-cost  zones  whose  cost  characteristics  are  currently  masked  by  the  averaging 
process.

funding  to  wireless  and  other  competitive  providers  of  Universal  Service  by  50  per-
cent  or  more,  while  having  no  impact  at  all  on  funding  to  ILECs.  This  unfair  and 
anti-competitive  recommendation  effectively  would  hinder  Universal  Service  by 
making  it  harder  for  rural  consumers  to  access  the  type  of  services  that  a  majority 
of consumers want—affordable, high-quality mobile universal service. 

The  statutory  principle  of  competitive  neutrality  prohibits  the  discriminatory  ap-
proach  recommended  by  the  Joint  Board,  which  both  Democratic  and  Republican 
members  of  this  Committee  have  directly  opposed.  The  Joint  Board’s  recommenda-
tion  flies  in  the  face  of  S.  101,  introduced  in  2007  by  Sen.  Stevens,  which  properly 
would codify the existing requirement that ‘‘[u]niversal service support mechanisms 
and  rules  should  be  competitively  neutral’’—i.e.,  that  such  rules  must  ‘‘neither  un-
fairly  advantage  nor  disadvantage  one  provider  over  another,  and  neither  unfairly 
favor  nor  disfavor  one  technology  over  another.’’  The  version  of  H.R.  5252  adopted 
by  this  Committee  in  2006  included  an  identical  provision.  The  Joint  Board’s  rec-
ommendation  also  defies  the  request  of  Senators  Rockefeller,  Pryor,  Dorgan,  Klo-
buchar,  and  Smith,  not  to  adopt  a  purportedly  ‘‘interim’’  cap,  ‘‘especially  one  im-
posed  only  on  certain  carriers,’’  because  it  would  ‘‘limit[]  rural  consumers’  options’’ 
and would impede the development of ‘‘competitively neutral’’ and ‘‘even-handed in-
terim  and  long-term  reform  measures.’’  Likewise,  the  Joint  Board  ignored  Senators 
Sununu,  McCain,  DeMint  and  Ensign,  who  urged  the  Board  not  to  adopt  a  ‘‘plan 
that would cap only one select group of providers but not another as we believe such 
a  fix  would  unfairly  skew  the  marketplace.’’  These  Senators  urged  the  Board  ‘‘not 
to  use  interim  measures,  such  as  a  temporary  cap,’’  and  not  to  ‘‘pick  winners  and 
losers or favor one technology over another.’’ 

Alltel  recognizes  the  widespread  interest  in  controlling  the  growth  of  the  Uni-
versal Service Fund. But such controls can and must be accomplished without com-
promising  the  principle  of  competitive  neutrality  or  interfering  with  consumers’  ac-
cess  to  wireless  and  broadband  services.  As  Commissioner  Copps  recognized  in  his 
testimony  before  this  Committee,  ‘‘Bringing  high-speed  broadband  to  every  corner 
of  the  country  is  the  central  infrastructure  challenge  we  face.’’  In  dissenting  from 
the Joint Board’s recommendation, Commissioner Copps also expressed ‘‘serious con-
cerns  that  such  a  cap  will  be  misinterpreted  as  a  solution,  even  though  it  does  not 
address—or pretend to address—the fundamental, comprehensive reforms needed to 
carry a viable and improved system of Universal Service forward in the twenty-first 
century.’’ 

The  Universal  Service  system  must  be  reformed  in  a  manner  that  advances  that 
core objective, not in a way that obstructs the deployment of competitive broadband 
facilities  and  services.  Significantly,  FCC  data  confirm  that  wireless  carriers  are 
rolling out broadband services to consumers much more rapidly than any other tele-
communications  industry  sector.  Consumers  in  rural  and  high-cost  areas  would  be 
the ultimate losers under proposals that would substantially reduce or eliminate the 
support  needed  to  stimulate  the  deployment  of  wireless  broadband  networks  and 
services. 

Question 1. There is a proposal before the FCC to restrain the growth of the Uni-
versal Service Fund by using ‘‘reverse auctions.’’ Under this proposal, carriers would 
bid  for  the  right  to  provide  service  in  a  given  service  area,  for  a  given  time  with 
the  entity  making  the  lowest  bid  winning  the  right  to  receive  support.  While  I  ap-
preciate  the  benefits  of  reverse  auctions,  I  also  worry  about  potential  costs  like 
lower  service  quality  in  rural  areas,  and  the  potential  for  creating  ‘‘stranded  costs’’ 
for auction losers that might harm access to capital. 
• What effect would the possibility of losing support have on the ability of carriers 
• What  would  happen  if  a  provider  wins  the  auction  by  bidding  too  much,  and 
• What effect would reverse auctions have on those providers that fail to win sup-

then responds later by raising prices or reducing service quality? 

to attract private investment from capital markets? 

port and their ability to roll out new services in rural America? 

Answer.  Alltel  shares  many  of  these  concerns.  A  ‘‘winner  takes  all’’  auction—in 
which  only  one  provider  could  receive  support  funds  at  the  end  of  the  auction— 
would eliminate support for many wireless and wireline carriers that currently pro-
vide  Universal  Service  throughout  their  designated  service  areas.  This  would  make 
it  difficult  or  impossible  for  these  wireless  and  wireline  carriers  to  continue  invest-
ing resources to provide high-quality, ubiquitous service in these high-cost areas. 

Alltel believes that the public interest would not be served either by reverse auc-
tions  or  by  other  changes  to  the  high-cost  funding  rules—whether  characterized  as 
‘‘interim’’  or  long-term—in  which  arbitrary  reductions  in  support  are  imposed  on 
certain carriers or categories of carriers. Universal Service reform—whether through

164 

auctions or some other reform measure—must be based on rational, well-supported, 
analysis and decisionmaking. 

Alltel  has  proposed  a  modest  $25  million  pilot  program  using  reverse  auctions  to 
promote  broadband  deployment  in  unserved  or  underserved  rural  markets  that 
would be designed to supplement, rather than replace, existing support mechanisms. 
Under Alltel’s pilot proposal, and under any other form of competitive bidding proc-
ess,  reverse  auctions  should  not  be  used  to  select  a  single  ETC  to  receive  support 
in any geographic area, but only to set the amount of high-cost support funding per 
line for all ETCs in each area. ‘‘Winner takes all’’ auctions would improperly distort 
competition  by  having  the  government  pick  winners  or  losers.  Instead,  auctions 
should  be  used,  if  at  all,  only  to  determine  an  efficient  level  of  support  that  is  the 
minimum  necessary  to  ensure  the  desired  level  of  service  in  each  geographic  area. 
Once  that  level  of  support  is  established,  all  carriers  that  satisfy  the  ETC  require-
ments  should  receive  the  same  (or  comparable)  amount  of  support  per  line,  regard-
less  of  which  one  submits  the  lowest  bid.  In  other  words,  rather  than  trying  to  use 
competitive bidding as a substitute for actual competition, an auction-based funding 
system  could  complement  the  competitive  market’s  incentives  for  carriers  to  effi-
ciently  invest  in  rural  markets  and  to  provide  high-quality  service  to  rural  con-
sumers. 

Such  an  auction  structure  would  avoid  distorting  the  marketplace  after  the  auc-
tion  is  concluded  and  ensure  that  consumers  receive  the  benefits  of  both  Universal 
Service and competition. It also would address concerns about a single auction win-
ner  later  undermining  Universal  Service  by  raising  prices  or  reducing  service  qual-
ity.  If  multiple  ETCs  are  receiving  funds  and  providing  the  supported  universal 
services after the auction, then market competition would protect consumers. If one 
ETC were to raise prices or reduce service quality, then consumers could opt to pur-
chase  service  from  an  alternative  carrier  that  also  receives  the  needed  support  to 
serve  the  area.  Also,  an  auction  in  which  multiple  carriers  continue  to  receive  sup-
port would reduce the likelihood that any one auction participant would offer an un-
reasonably  low  bid,  because  each  bidder,  as  an  ETC,  would  be  required  to  provide 
all the required elements of Universal Service to all consumers throughout the area, 
consistent with § 214(e)(1) of the Act. 

Alltel opposes proposals, such as the Verizon plan, to use auctions for competitive 
carriers,  while  retaining  existing  support  mechanisms  for  the  ILECs.  These  anti- 
competitive  plans  would  likely  eliminate  funding  for  the  majority  of  wireless  car-
riers,  lead  to  substantial  reductions  in  funding  to  remaining  wireless  Universal 
Service  providers,  while  maintaining  existing  funding  for  wireline  ILECs  in  most 
cases. This outcome would unreasonably discriminate against wireless companies, in 
violation of the Act and well established law, and to the detriment of consumers and 
intermodal, facilities-based competition. It also would thwart efficient investment in 
rural areas. Instead, if any reverse auction plan were adopted, it must be structured 
to have all ETCs in a given geographic area participate in a single auction, regard-
less of the technology they use and regardless whether they are incumbents or com-
petitive entrants. 

Question 2. Mr. Massey, would it be possible to construct a Universal Service sup-
port mechanism for wireless providers that would be based on the cost of providing 
wireless services? 

• In your view, what would be wrong with such an approach? 
• What  effect  would  tying  wireless  support  to  wireless  costs  have  on  the  size  of 

the fund? 

Answer. Cost models could be developed to estimate the costs of providing service 
in  rural  areas  using  both  wireless  or  wireline  technologies,  and  Universal  Service 
mechanisms  could  be  developed  to  set  support  levels  based  on  those  costs.  Ideally, 
however,  the  Universal  Service  support  mechanism  would  provide  funding  to  every 
ETC based on the cost of the most efficient (least cost) technology available to serve 
all  customers  in  the  geographic  area—wireless  or  wireline.  This  would  ‘‘right  size’’ 
the Universal Service Fund by preventing excessive disbursements to some carriers 
just  because  those  carriers  have  received  large  amounts  in  the  past,  while  also  en-
suring that sufficient funds are available to enable carriers to provide the supported 
services in high-cost areas. It also would create incentives for all carriers to operate 
as  efficiently  as  possible  and  would  avoid  giving  discriminatory  advantages  to  one 
group of carriers and disadvantages to others. 

Most importantly, a competitively neutral Universal Service system—based on the 
costs  of  the  most  efficient  technology,  rather  than  based  on  an  individual  carrier’s 
past  investment  decisions—would  avoid  distorting  competition  and  would  protect 
consumers’ rights to select their preferred services in a competitive marketplace. By 
contrast, it would make no sense to provide greater funding to more inefficient car-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:09 Mar 21, 2012 Jkt 073387 PO 00000 Frm 00168 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\73387.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

165 

riers  (those  that  incur  greater  costs  to  serve  consumers  in  a  given  area)  and  less 
funding  to  more  efficient  carriers.  Such  a  non-competitively  neutral  system  would 
create  perverse  incentives  for  carriers  to  operate  as  inefficiently  as  possible.  It  also 
would discriminate against efficient service providers by depriving them of revenues 
that are available to carriers that operate in a more costly manner.1 

The 1996 Act requires that all Universal Service funding be competitively neutral. 
In  order  to  ensure  competitive  neutrality,  all  funds  must  be  ‘‘portable’’—i.e.,  avail-
able  regardless  whether  a  consumer  decides  to  purchase  service  from  an  ILEC  or 
a competitive ETC—as West Virginia consumer advocate Billy Jack Gregg explained 
in  his  March  1,  2007  testimony  (see  page  21),  and  as  the  FCC  and  the  courts  have 
affirmed  many  times.  This  means  that  neither  a  wireline  company  nor  a  wireless 
company  should  receive  different  amounts  of  support  funding  for  providing  service 
to a given customer in a particular geographic area. 

It  would  be  inappropriate  to  depart  from  competitive  neutrality  by  retaining  cur-
rent funding levels (based primarily on embedded or historical costs) for ILECs and 
disbursing a reduced level of support to wireless or other competitive ETCs. The an-
swer  does  not  lie  in  trying  to  develop  a  new,  separate  set  of  rules  for  funding  com-
petitive  ETCs,  while  allowing  the  ILECs  to  continue  to  operate  under  a  monopoly- 
inspired  form  of  regulation,  e.g.,  guaranteed  rate  of  return  on  embedded  costs,  re-
gardless  of  efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  serving  rural  areas.  And  it  would  be  im-
possible as a practical matter to set wireless carriers’ funding based on their ‘‘own’’ 
embedded  costs,  using  cost  studies  that  parallels  the  approaches  used  by  the  rural 
ILECs—i.e.,  using  factors  such  as  nationwide  average  cost  per  loop,  subscriber  line 
charge  revenue  and  DEM  weighting.  The  application  of  these  monopoly-oriented, 
ILEC-based standards to wireless carriers would be a contrived and convoluted proc-
ess, and ultimately would make no sense. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

RICHARD N. MASSEY 

Question  1.  Is  a  reverse  auction  process  the  best  way  to  reduce  overall  Fund 
growth? What do members of the panel think of other options, such as breaking up 
(or disaggregating) study areas to target funds to areas that are truly ‘‘High-Cost?’’ 
Answer. In the very short-term, the best way to limit overall Fund growth would 
be to adopt a competitively neutral proposal such as that advanced by West Virginia 
consumer  advocate  Billy  Jack  Gregg.  As  an  interim  measure,  Mr.  Gregg  has  pro-
posed  a  single  inflation-adjusted  cap  on  the  growth  of  the  total  high-cost  support 
disbursed  to  all  categories  of  ETCs  (including  ILECs  and  competitors).  Funding 
would  be  distributed  among  all  eligible  wireline  and  wireless  carriers  in  each  area, 
with  proportional  adjustments  based  on  each  ETC’s  share  of  customer  lines.  Mr. 
Gregg’s  proposal  would  prevent  undue  growth  in  the  overall  level  of  funding  while 
also  spreading  the  impact  of  the  Fund  growth  limitation  proportionately  among  all 
ETCs.  Unlike  a  wireless-specific  fund  cap,  Mr.  Gregg’s  proposal  would  avoid  severe 
reductions  in  total  support  or  per-line  support  to  any  category  of  carriers,  would 
avoid distorting competition or favoring one technology over another in rural areas, 
and would avoid imposing barriers to entry. 

In the medium- to long-term, Alltel agrees with Senators Rockefeller, Pryor, Dor-
gan, Klobuchar, and Smith that ‘‘the Board should seriously consider competitively- 
neutral  proposals,  ensure  accountability  for  how  funds  are  used,  and  promote  ad-
vanced  services  in  rural  regions  through  effective  targeting  of  funds  to  high-cost 
areas.’’  In  particular,  regulators  could  control  Fund  size  while  also  advancing  Uni-
versal Service more effectively by targeting funds to the highest cost ‘‘disaggregated’’ 
geographic  areas,  regardless  of  whether  those  areas  were  served  by  a  small,  mid- 
sized,  or  large  ILEC  in  the  past.  The  current  system  disburses  much  more  funding 
to  smaller  ILEC  ‘‘study  areas’’  (even  where  the  supposedly  small  ILEC  operating 
companies are owned by large holding companies), and improperly requires mid-size 
and  larger  ILECs  to  support  the  high-cost  portions  of  their  study  areas  using  im-
plicit  subsidies  from  low  cost  to  high-cost  areas.  This  system  also  harms  wireless 
ETCs  such  as  Alltel  that  focus  on  serving  consumers  in  rural  areas.  Instead,  high- 
cost support funding should be targeted to consumers in outlying rural areas. 

1 For  similar  reasons,  the  public  interest  requires  the  elimination  of  the  so-called  ‘‘rate  of  re-
turn’’  system,  in  which  some  components  of  the  existing  Universal  Service  system  reimburse 
ILECs  for  each  dollar  they  spend.  This  system  creates  perverse  incentives  for  these  carriers  to 
operate  as  inefficiently  as  possible,  and  unfairly  guarantees  these  carriers’  revenue  streams 
while imposing marketplace risks on competitive carriers. The FCC has stated repeatedly, ever 
since  1997,  that  it  intended  to  eliminate  this  obsolete  system,  and  Alltel  filed  a  petition  asking 
it to do so in 2003. But thus far the FCC has failed to deliver on this commitment.

Alltel  also  believes  Fund  growth  can  be  controlled  by  imposing  more  rigorous 
oversight  to  ensure  that  Funds  are  actually  being  used  in  a  manner  that  furthers 
the  goals  of  the  Universal  Service  Fund.  Competitive  ETCs  are  currently  required 
to  submit  detailed  annual  reports  regarding  their  plans  for  network  construction 
and  service  quality  improvement,  as  well  as  information  on  the  amounts  of  Uni-
versal  Service  support  received  and  how  such  support  was  used  to  improve  their 
networks  and  benefit  consumers.  However,  in  most  states  ILECs  are  not  subject  to 
comparably rigorous reporting standards—but they should be, in order to ensure the 
integrity of the program. In addition, the oversight and processing of ILEC funding 
should  be  entrusted  to  a  neutral  administrator  subject  to  strict  FCC  oversight  (i.e., 
USAC),  rather  than  the  rural  ILEC-controlled  advocacy  organization  (NECA)  that 
controls this process today. 

Question  2.  If  we  move  to  a  reverse  auction  process,  isn’t  there  a  possibility  that 
some providers may bid so low that they end up financially unable to provide serv-
ice?  Furthermore,  if  an  ‘‘auction  winner’’  went  bankrupt,  how  can  we  be  sure  that 
households in that area continue to receive service? 

Answer. Alltel shares many of these concerns, and we have addressed them in the 
response to Chairman Inouye’s questions for the record. In short, we oppose a ‘‘win-
ner  takes  all’’  auction,  in  which  the  auction  would  select  a  single  ETC  to  receive 
support and other ETCs would receive no support funds. Such a system would have 
government pick winners and losers and would deprive consumers in these high-cost 
areas  of  access  to  service  from  a  range  of  competing  service  providers.  Instead,  re-
verse  auctions  should  be  used,  if  at  all,  only  to  set  the  efficient  level  of  high-cost 
support funding per line for all ETCs in each area. 

Such  an  auction  structure  would  avoid  distorting  the  marketplace  after  the  auc-
tion  is  concluded  and  ensure  that  consumers  receive  the  benefits  of  both  Universal 
Service and competition. It also would address concerns about a single auction win-
ner  later  undermining  Universal  Service  by  raising  prices  or  reducing  service  qual-
ity.  If  multiple  ETCs  are  receiving  funds  and  providing  the  supported  universal 
services after the auction, then market competition would protect consumers. If one 
ETC were to raise prices or reduce service quality, then consumers could opt to pur-
chase  service  from  an  alternative  carrier  that  also  receives  the  needed  support  to 
serve  the  area.  Also,  an  auction  in  which  multiple  carriers  continue  to  receive  sup-
port would reduce the likelihood that any one auction participant would offer an un-
reasonably  low  bid,  because  each  bidder,  as  an  ETC,  would  be  required  to  provide 
all the required elements of Universal Service to all consumers throughout the area, 
consistent with § 214(e)(1) of the Act. 

Question  3.  Alltel  and  Verizon  have  presented  separate  proposals  for  a  reverse 
auction  process.  Can  you  explain  what  specifically  makes  your  proposal  superior? 
Also, how do your plans differ from the reverse auction proposal presented by CTIA? 
Answer. Alltel opposes Verizon’s plan and other proposals to conduct multiple sep-
arate auctions for different technologies or classes of carriers. These anti-competitive 
plans  would  likely  eliminate  funding  for  the  majority  of  wireless  carriers,  lead  to 
substantial reductions in funding to remaining wireless Universal Service providers, 
while  maintaining  existing  funding  for  wireline  ILECs  in  most  cases.  This  outcome 
would unreasonably discriminate against wireless companies, in violation of the Act 
and well established law, and to the detriment of consumers and intermodal, facili-
ties-based  competition.  It  also  would  thwart  efficient  investment  in  rural  areas.  In-
stead,  if  any  reverse  auction  plan  were  adopted,  it  must  be  structured  to  have  all 
ETCs  in  a  given  geographic  area  participate  in  a  single  auction,  regardless  of  the 
technology they use and regardless whether they are incumbents or competitive en-
trants. 

By  contrast  to  Verizon,  Alltel  has  proposed  a  modest  $25  million  pilot  program 
using  reverse  auctions  to  promote  broadband  deployment  in  unserved  or  under-
served  rural  markets  that  would  be  designed  to  supplement,  rather  than  replace, 
existing support mechanisms. Verizon’s plan would continue to focus funding on tra-
ditional  ‘‘plain  old  telephone  service;’’  Alltel’s  reverse  auction  plan  is  more  forward- 
looking because it would target funding to encourage deployment of new broadband 
networks and services. 

Alltel’s  and  CTIA’s  auction  plans  are  similar  in  most  respects.  Both  Alltel  and 
CTIA support auctions in which multiple ETCs would be able to compete in the pro-
vision  of  supported  services  after  the  auction  concludes,  and  both  Alltel  and  CTIA 
oppose ‘‘winner takes all’’ auctions, for the reasons discussed above. CTIA has indi-
cated  that,  if  needed  to  encourage  low  bidding,  the  auction  winner  (i.e.,  the  lowest 
bidder)  could  receive  slightly  more  funding  per  line  than  other  ETCs  in  the  area 
(‘‘winner takes more’’). Alltel believes that it would be preferable for all ETCs to re-
ceive the same amount of funding, but would not object to CTIA’s approach as long

as  there  is  only  a  small  difference  between  the  amounts  disbursed  to  low  bidders 
and to other qualifying ETCs. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

THOMAS J. TAUKE 

Question 1. There is a proposal before the FCC to restrain the growth of the Uni-
versal Service Fund by using ‘‘reverse auctions.’’ Under this proposal, carriers would 
bid  for  the  right  to  provide  service  in  a  given  service  area,  for  a  given  time  with 
the  entity  making  the  lowest  bid  winning  the  right  to  receive  support.  While  I  ap-
preciate  the  benefits  of  reverse  auctions,  I  also  worry  about  potential  costs  like 
lower  service  quality  in  rural  areas,  and  the  potential  for  creating  ‘‘stranded  costs’’ 
for  auction  losers  that  might  harm  access  to  capital.  What  effect  would  the  possi-
bility  of  losing  support  have  on  the  ability  of  carriers  to  attract  private  investment 
from capital markets? 

Answer.  There  are  several  different  proposals  before  the  FCC  regarding  the  use 
of  competitive  bidding  or  reverse  auctions  to  distribute  Universal  Service  support. 
Under Verizon’s proposal, the only carriers that could ‘‘lose’’ USF support are those 
in areas where the system is supporting more than one network. Those carriers that 
demonstrate their efficiency by winning the auction will continue to receive support 
in  the  amount  of  their  bids.  Thus,  the  auction  process  itself  will  help  capital  mar-
kets identify efficient carriers, which could well promote private investment. 

Verizon’s proposal would not ‘‘flash cut’’ to auctions, but would phase them in over 
time, and would provide sufficient transitions for carriers that are currently receiv-
ing support. Verizon has proposed that the FCC phase in separate and parallel auc-
tions:  one  auction  in  areas  with  more  than  one  wireless  provider  receiving  USF 
funds and one auction in areas with more than one wireline provider receiving USF 
funds. 

Auctions  initially  would  be  held  only  among  wireless  ETCs  and  only  in  areas 
where there is more than one wireless ETC. In this first phase, auctions would not 
affect  funding  for  rural  telephone  companies.  After  the  wireless  auctions  have  been 
completed, the FCC would hold auctions among wireline ETCs in areas where there 
is at least one wireline ETC. Because there are relatively few wireline CETCs today, 
this  part  of  Verizon’s  proposal  would  affect  very  few  areas.  After  both  sets  of  auc-
tions  are  completed,  Verizon  suggests  that  the  FCC  could  assess  the  results  of  the 
auctions held so far, and determine next steps. 

Question  1a.  What  would  happen  if  a  provider  wins  the  auction  by  bidding  too 

much, and then responds later by raising prices or reducing service quality? 

Answer.  Consumer  choice  is  the  most  effective  check  on  prices,  and  that  would 
not  change  if  auctions  are  used  to  identify  the  most  efficient  carriers  in  high-cost 
areas. More than ever before, consumers of communications services have options— 
from  both  traditional  service  providers  and  new  offerings  by  cable,  Voice  over  IP, 
and wireless providers—and they are taking advantage of them. Many of these pro-
viders  operate  without  any  Universal  Service  support,  which  constrains  the  prices 
all  carriers  can  charge.  There  may  be  some  areas  where  wireline  providers  do  not 
face competition; in those areas, Verizon does not propose to hold USF auctions, and 
in any event the auction process would not impact existing price regulations. 

Every  purchasing  government  agency  that  uses  contractors  must  be  concerned 
with  quality  of  service.  In  this  context,  as  in  the  government  procurement  context, 
the  auction  process  itself  can  ensure  that  a  supported  provider  offers  a  minimum 
level  of  service.  In  an  USF  auction,  a  document  like  an  RFP  (request  for  proposal) 
or  an  RFQ  (request  for  a  quote),  which  are  used  in  other  types  of  government  pro-
curement, would be issued. That document would define the obligations of the win-
ning bidder in an auction. The bidder would know these obligations in advance and, 
by bidding, would agree to accept them. Once the auction was over, the winning bid-
der  would  also  sign  a  contract  that  would  outline  these  responsibilities  and  which 
would help ensure that service quality benchmarks are satisfied. 

Question 1b. What effect would reverse auctions have on those providers that fail 

to win support and their ability to roll out new services in rural America? 

Answer.  Auctions  do  not  prevent  carriers,  even  those  carriers  that  participate  in 
but  do  not  win  the  auction,  from  providing  service  in  an  area.  Again,  many  pro-
viders—especially new intermodal providers—operate without any Universal Service 
support,  and  would  presumably  continue  to  do  so  even  in  areas  where  an  auction 
has been held. Verizon supports targeting USF support to where it is truly needed; 
in  areas  where  a  provider  is  able  to  operate  without  support,  the  presumption 
should be that we do not need USF in that area to ensure that consumers have af-
fordable access. Moreover, auction results would not stand forever. Carriers that do

168 

not  win  the  auction  will  have  opportunities  to  bid  again  for  support  in  the  same 
areas and to nominate other areas for auction. 

We  also  must  remember  that  today’s  Universal  Service  system,  which  bases  sup-
port on a carrier’s costs, does not create ideal incentives for carriers to innovate and 
develop  new  services.  In  contrast,  an  auction  process  would  reward  carriers  for  in-
troducing  new  services  because  those  carriers  would  have  a  stronger  business  plan 
and  would  be  better  positioned  to  win  an  auction.  Competition  in  the  marketplace 
has  served  American  consumers  well,  and  Verizon’s  proposal  would  bring  those 
same incentives to bear for the benefit of consumers in rural areas. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

THOMAS J. TAUKE 

Question  1.  Is  a  reverse  auction  process  the  best  way  to  reduce  overall  Fund 
growth? What do members of the panel think of other options, such as breaking up 
(or disaggregating) study areas to target funds to areas that are truly ‘‘High-Cost?’’ 
Answer.  Disaggregation  of  support  from  study  areas  to  wire  centers  or  the  sub- 
wire  center  level  is  one  potential  solution,  but  it  is  a  potential  solution  for  a  dif-
ferent  problem—how  to  better  target  high-cost  funds  to  areas  where  they  are  truly 
needed. 

We  should  keep  in  mind  that  targeting  to  smaller  geographic  areas  is  not  a  way 
to  control  the  Fund’s  size.  On  the  contrary,  if  the  current  funding  mechanism  were 
to be modified to use smaller geographic areas to distribute support, the result could 
be a much larger fund. 

Verizon is supportive of efforts to target support to areas where the need is great-
est.  In  fact,  our  proposal  makes  it  possible  to  target  the  funding  to  smaller  geo-
graphic  areas  without  making  the  Fund  bigger,  because  we  also  suggest  a  cap  that 
provides  immediate  control  of  Fund  growth  and  an  auction  mechanism  that  deter-
mines  just  the  right  amount  of  support  for  each  targeted  area.  Gaining  control  of 
fund growth through a reasonable cap is a critical first step that will give us breath-
ing room to implement fundamental, long-term reforms. 

Question  2.  If  we  move  to  a  reverse  auction  process,  isn’t  there  a  possibility  that 
some providers may bid so low that they end up financially unable to provide serv-
ice?  Furthermore,  if  an  ‘‘auction  winner’’  went  bankrupt,  how  can  we  be  sure  that 
households in that area continue to receive service? 

Answer. In any government procurement process, the responsible entity must en-
sure  that  the  winning  bidder  will  perform  as  specified  in  the  contract.  Auctioning 
USF obligations is no different. 

In  the  USF  context,  this  can  be  accomplished  by  qualifying  prospective  bidders 
to ensure that they are technically and financially able to perform, posting of bonds, 
and  the  enforcement  of  penalties  for  nonperformance.  Another  enforcement  mecha-
nism could be disqualification from future bidding if a company fails to perform. 

Question  3.  Alltel  and  Verizon  have  presented  separate  proposals  for  a  reverse 
auction  process.  Can  you  explain  what  specifically  makes  your  proposal  superior? 
Also, how do your plans differ from the reverse auction proposal presented by CTIA? 
Answer.  Verizon  has  proposed  the  most  effective  and  workable  path  to  Universal 
Service reform. We propose immediate action in the form of reasonable caps at cur-
rent  funding  levels  to  address  the  most  immediate  crisis  the  Fund  faces:  its  rapid 
and  unsustainable  growth.  We  propose  implementing  competitive  bidding  quickly 
but  on  limited  basis  (first  in  areas  with  multiple  wireless  ETCs),  and  where  it  can 
provide  the  greatest  benefit.  We  then  propose  to  give  the  Joint  Board  and  the  FCC 
the  flexibility  to  assess  the  results  of  these  steps  and  to  decide  whether  to  extend 
the reforms more broadly. 

In  contrast,  Alltel  does  not  propose  a  solution  that  will  properly  stabilize  and  ra-
tionalize the fund. Alltel proposes only to cap the per-line amount of support in each 
area.  This  capping  proposal  would  be  ineffective.  It  ignores  the  main  source  of 
growth  in  the  fund:  support  provided  to  the  growing  number  of  wireless  handsets. 
Moreover,  Alltel  only  supports  the  use  of  auctions  for  a  small  fraction  of  the  Fund 
($25 million) and only for new broadband services. If it is necessary for government 
to  intervene  in  broadband  deployment,  there  are  better  ways  to  target  broadband 
support  than  by  including  broadband  in  the  definition  of  services  supported  by  the 
current Fund. 

CTIA  is  supportive  of  auctions,  but  suggests  that  auctions  should  be  designed  so 
that  multiple  providers  continue  to  receive  support  with  the  auction  winner  receiv-
ing  a  higher  amount  of  support  (which  CTIA  calls  ‘‘winner  takes  more.’’)  However, 
an auction that has more than one winner and no ‘‘losers’’ would neither rationalize 
nor stabilize the system, and would not contain the growth of the fund.

A ‘‘winner takes more’’ approach does not provide the proper incentives for partici-
pants  to  submit  bids  that  are  no  larger  than  necessary  to  provide  supported  serv-
ices,  and  could  lead  to  collusion  and  strategic  behavior  that  would  skew  the  auc-
tion’s  results.  For  example,  if  all  the  bidders  knew  that  no  bidder  could  truly  lose 
the auction, there would be strong incentives for all the bidders to collude and sub-
mit large bids so that all of the participants received higher levels of support. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

W. TOM SIMMONS 

Question.  There  is  a  proposal  before  the  FCC  to  restrain  the  growth  of  the  Uni-
versal Service Fund by using ‘‘reverse auctions.’’ Under this proposal, carriers would 
bid  for  the  right  to  provide  service  in  a  given  service  area,  for  a  given  time  with 
the  entity  making  the  lowest  bid  winning  the  right  to  receive  support.  While  I  ap-
preciate  the  benefits  of  reverse  auctions,  I  also  worry  about  potential  costs  like 
lower  service  quality  in  rural  areas,  and  the  potential  for  creating  ‘‘stranded  costs’’ 
for auction losers that might harm access to capital. 
• What effect would the possibility of losing support have on the ability of carriers 
• What  would  happen  if  a  provider  wins  the  auction  by  bidding  too  much,  and 
• What effect would reverse auctions have on those providers that fail to win sup-

then responds later by raising prices or reducing service quality? 

to attract private investment from capital markets? 

port and their ability to roll out new services in rural America? 

Answer.  As  stated  in  my  written  testimony,  the  continued  growth  in  the  size  of 
the  Universal  Service  Fund  is  a  matter  of  significant  concern  to  the  cable  industry 
for  a  simple  reason—these  costs  ultimately  are  borne  by  consumers.  Based  on  the 
anticipated growth of cable telephony services, and the corresponding growth in the 
share of the program that will be funded by cable consumers, our industry supports 
efforts to reduce the burden of Federal support programs by more efficiently distrib-
uting support. 

The  above  questions  suggest  concern  about  the  impact  reverse  auctions  would 
have  on  existing  networks.  As  network-based  companies,  we  appreciate  that  con-
cern.  In  reforming  the  program  for  distribution  of  Federal  Universal  Service  sup-
port, however, it is important to keep in mind that the program was created to ben-
efit  consumers,  not  carriers.  The  subsidization  of  networks  through  a  government 
fund is simply a means to that end in situations where market forces would not oth-
erwise meet consumers’ needs. Where market forces can meet those needs, as is in-
creasingly  likely  given  the  growth  of  cable  voice  services,  government  subsidization 
is unnecessary and potentially counterproductive. 

Reverse  auctions  are  a  mechanism  by  which  government  can  take  advantage  of 
market  forces  (i.e.,  the  presence  of  multiple  networks  in  areas  previously  served  by 
a  single  network)  to  distribute  support  more  efficiently.  If  structured  properly,  they 
offer an opportunity not only to reduce the size of the fund, but also to promote com-
petition  in  high-cost  areas  by  making  support  available  on  a  more  equitable  basis. 
The challenge is to reduce the burden on consumers and promote competition, with-
out  sacrificing  the  level  of  service  provided  in  these  areas  today.  We  believe  that 
an auction program can do this by specifying minimum levels of service to be offered 
and establishing obligations to be met by all bidders. This should include some sort 
of  carrier-of-last-resort  obligation,  which  will  ensure  that  the  fundamental  goal  of 
providing service to all consumers is met. Any facilities-based provider that commits 
to meeting these requirements should be eligible to participate in the auction. 

Implementing a reverse auction process for Universal Service should not result in 
stranded  costs.  If  the  auction  takes  place  in  an  area  with  multiple  networks,  all 
those  networks  have  an  incentive  to  compete  for  customers  (because  they  need  the 
revenue  to  cover  their  costs)  regardless  of  whether  they  win  or  lose  the  auction. 
Even if an ILEC loses customers, the investment generally is not stranded because 
it  can  be  used  if  the  carrier  wins  the  customer  back,  which  it  has  every  incentive 
to do.

growth? What do members of the panel think of other options, such as breaking up 
(or disaggregating) study areas to target funds to areas that are truly ‘‘High-Cost?’’ 
Answer.  As  stated  in  response  to  Chairman  Inouye’s  question  above,  we  believe 
that reverse auctions, if structured properly, offer an opportunity not only to reduce 
the  size  of  the  fund,  but  also  to  promote  competition  in  high-cost  areas  by  making 
support  available  on  a  more  equitable  basis.  NCTA’s  view  is  that  reverse  auctions 
can be effective only if they cover relatively small service areas. Not only is this crit-
ical  to  ensuring  that  the  bidding  process  is  competitively  and  technologically  neu-
tral,  it  also  has  the  effect  of  targeting  more  support  to  truly  high-cost  areas  while 
reducing  support  to  those  areas  where  market  forces  are  most  active.  NCTA  would 
not  oppose  consideration  of  other  methods  of  targeting  support  if  they  could  be  ac-
complished in a manner that reduces overall Fund size. 

Question  2.  If  we  move  to  a  reverse  auction  process,  isn’t  there  a  possibility  that 
some providers may bid so low that they end up financially unable to provide serv-
ice?  Furthermore,  if  an  ‘‘auction  winner’’  went  bankrupt,  how  can  we  be  sure  that 
households in that area continue to receive service? 

Answer.  As  noted  above,  NCTA  believes  that  a  minimum  set  of  binding  service 
obligations  should  be  part  of  any  auction  program.  In  addition,  in  establishing  the 
ground rules for such a program, the FCC could establish procedures to ensure con-
tinuation of service and to address the consequences of a bankruptcy filing.
