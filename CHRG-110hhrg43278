Harmful Algal Blooms:
The Challenges on the

Nation’s Coastlines

THURSDAY, JULY 10, 2008

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On Thursday, July 10, 2008 the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the
Committee on Science and Technology will hold a hearing to examine Harmful Algal
Blooms (HABs) recent trends and impacts on the coast, ocean, and Great Lakes.

The purpose of the hearing is to examine the challenges harmful algal blooms and
red  tide  events  impose  on  the  coastlines  and  in  marine  and  freshwaters.  The  hear-
ing  will  also  examine  the  current  research  on  the  microbial  bloom  ecology  as  well
as  the  options  for  prevention,  control,  and  mitigation.  In  addition,  the  hearing  will
examine  the  state  of  the  science  and  recent  trends  on  an  international  level  as  it
relates to national and global changes. The hearing will examine the National Plan
for  Algal  Toxins  and  Harmful  Algal  Blooms,  and  how  the  plan  will  affect  our  na-
tion’s ability to control the HABs problem.

Witnesses
Dr.  Robert  Magnien  is  the  Director  of  the  Center  for  Sponsored  Coastal
Ocean  Research  in  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration,
NOAA.  Dr.  Magnien  will  discuss  the  current  state  of  federally  funded  HABs  re-
search  at  NOAA,  as  well  as  options  for  prevention,  control,  and  mitigation.  He  will
also discuss the National Plan for Algal Toxins and Harmful Algal Blooms.
Dr.  Donald  Anderson  is  a  Senior  Scientist  and  Director  of  the  Coastal
Ocean  Institute  at  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution.  Dr.  Anderson  will
discuss the current research on the ecology of the blooms of microorganisms on both
the east and west coasts. He will also discuss the issue and the state of the science
on an international level, as well as comment on the National Plan for Algal Toxins
and Harmful Algal Blooms.
Mr.  Dan  Ayres  is  a  Coastal  Shellfish  Manager  and  Lead  Biologist  at  the
Washington  State  Department  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  Region  Six  Office.  Mr.
Ayres  will  discuss  the  challenges  harmful  algal  blooms  and  red  tide  events  impose
on the coastlines. He will also discuss the impacts of harmful algal blooms on beach
closures,  tourism,  human  health,  and  the  science  behind  these  toxins.  He  too  will
comment on the National Plan for Algal Toxins and Harmful Algal Blooms.
Dr.  H.  Kenneth  Hudnell  is  Vice  President  and  Director  of  Science  at
SolarBee  Inc.  SolarBee  is  a  solar-powered  technology  to  improve  water  quality
through high-flow, long-distance circulation. Dr. Hudnell will discuss the challenges
and impacts of harmful algal blooms, specifically in freshwater. He will also discuss
the applications of new technologies for prevention and control of biotoxins in water.

Background
What Are Harmful Algal Blooms?

Algae  are  photosynthetic,  plant-like  protists.  Algae  are  vitally  important  to  ma-
rine and freshwater ecosystems, and most species of algae are not harmful. Blooms
occur  in  both  marine  and  freshwater  environments  when  some  algal  species  out-
compete  others  and  reproduce  rapidly  to  produce  large  numbers  of  algae.  An  algal
bloom  can  discolor  the  water  due  to  the  large  number  of  algal  cells.  To  the  human
eye,  blooms  can  appear  greenish,  brown,  and  even  reddish-orange  depending  upon

the  algal  species,  the  aquatic  ecosystem,  and  the  concentration  of  the  organisms.
Blooms  can  kill  fish  and  other  aquatic  life  by  decreasing  sunlight  available  to  the
water and by using up all of the available oxygen in the water (hypoxia).

A  harmful  algal  bloom  (HAB)  is  a  bloom  that  produces  toxins  which  are  detri-
mental  to  plants  and  animals.  These  outbreaks  are  commonly  called  red  or  brown
tides. These produced toxins accumulate in shellfish, fish, or through the accumula-
tion  of  biomass  that  in  turn  affect  other  organisms  and  alter  food  webs.  In  recent
years,  many  of  the  Nation’s  coastlines,  near-shore  marine  waters,  and  freshwaters
have experienced an increase in the number, frequency, duration and type of HABs.
Blooms can be caused by several factors. An increase in nutrients can cause algae
growth  and  reproduction  to  increase  dramatically  just  as  fertilizing  a  lawn  makes
the  grass  grow  faster.  In  other  instances,  an  environmental  change  allows  certain
algae  to  out-compete  others  for  nutrients  which  can  result  in  a  bloom  of  the  algae
with  the  advantage.  This  environmental  change  can  be  water  quality,  temperature,
nutrients, sunlight, or other factors.

Impacts of Harmful Algal Blooms

Harmful algal blooms are one of the most scientifically complex and economically
significant coastal management issues facing the Nation. In the past, only a few re-
gions  of  the  U.S.  were  affected  by  HABs,  but  now  all  U.S.  coastal  regions  have  re-
ported  major  blooms.  These  phenomena  have  devastating  environmental,  economic,
and  human  health  impacts.  Impacts  include  human  illness  and  mortality  following
direct  consumption  or  indirect  exposure  to  toxic  shellfish  or  toxins  in  the  environ-
ment; economic hardship for coastal economies, many of which are highly dependent
on  tourism  or  harvest  of  local  seafood;  as  well  as  dramatic  fish,  bird,  and  mammal
mortalities.  There  are  also  devastating  impacts  to  ecosystems,  leading  to  environ-
mental damage that may reduce the ability of those systems to sustain species due
to habitat degradation, increased susceptibility to disease, and long-term alterations
to community structure.

The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act

Scientific  understanding  of  harmful  algal  blooms  and  hypoxic  events  (severe  oxy-
gen depletion) has progressed significantly since the early 1990’s, but major impedi-
ments  still  remain  for  prediction,  control  and  mitigation  of  these  complex  phe-
nomena. Practical and innovative approaches to address hypoxia and HABs in U.S.
waters are essential for management of aquatic ecosystems and to fulfill a stronger
investment  in  the  health  of  the  coasts  and  oceans  called  for  by  the  U.S.  Ocean  Ac-
tion  Plan1 and  recent  reports  on  ocean  policy.  Recognizing  this  need,  in  2004  Con-
gress  reauthorized  and  expanded  the  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  and  Hypoxia  Research
and Control Act of 1998 (Public Law 105–383) by passing the Harmful Algal Bloom
and Hypoxia Amendments Act of 2004 (Public Law 108–456).

The  1998  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  and  Hypoxia  Research  and  Control  Act
(HABHRCA)  established  an  Interagency  Task  Force  to  develop  a  national  HAB  as-
sessment and authorized funding for existing and new research programs on HABs.
This  includes  two  multi-year  research  programs  at  NOAA  that  focus  on  HABs,  the
Ecology  and  Oceanography  of  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  (ECOHAB)  program  and  the
Monitoring  and  Event  Response  for  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  (MERHAB)  program.
These  programs  involve  federal,  State,  and  academic  partners  and  support  inter-
disciplinary  extramural  research  studies  to  address  the  issues  of  HABs  in  an  eco-
system  context.  HABHRCA  was  reauthorized  in  2004,  requiring  assessments  of
HABs  in  different  coastal  regions  and  in  the  Great  Lakes  and  plans  to  expand  re-
search  and  address  the  impacts  of  HABs.  The  law  also  authorized  research,  edu-
cation, and monitoring activities related to the prevention, reduction, and control of
harmful algal blooms and hypoxia and reconstituted the Interagency Task Force on
HABs and Hypoxia.

The  law  also  directed  NOAA  to  produce  three  reports  and  a  research  and  tech-
nology  transfer  plan.  These  were  to  be  provided  to  Congress  and  made  publicly
available  within  one  to  two  years  after  the  date  of  enactment  (e.g.,  by  December
2006). The Prediction and Response Report,2 released in September 2007, addresses
both the state of research and methods for HAB prediction and response, especially
at  the  federal  level.  None  of  the  other  products  mandated  by  the  legislation  have
been completed. The National Scientific Research, Development, Demonstration, and

Technology  Transfer  Plan  for  Reducing  Impacts  from  Harmful  Algal  Blooms
(RDDTT Plan) is undergoing interagency approval. This plan will establish research
priorities to develop and demonstrate prevention, control and mitigation methods to
advance  current  prediction  and  response  capabilities.  The  Scientific  Assessment  of
Freshwater Harmful Algal Blooms is reported to be complete. However, it is not yet
available.  The  law  also  required  a  scientific  assessment  of  hypoxia  to  be  produced
within two years of enactment. This report is not yet completed.

The  law  also  provided  for  the  development  of  local  and  regional  scientific  assess-
ments of HABs and hypoxia. These were not required to be produced by any specific
date. These assessments were to be initiated at the request of State, tribal, or local
governments  or  for  affected  areas  identified  by  NOAA.  No  reports  have  been  pro-
duced through this provision.

Current Federal Research Programs and Plans

The  following  are  examples  of  ongoing  research  programs  that  support  inter-

disciplinary research studies to address the issues of HABs and hypoxia:

• Ecology  and  Oceanography  of  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  (ECOHAB)—a  multi-
agency  partnership  between  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency
(EPA),  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA),  National
Science  Foundation  (NSF),  NOAA’s  Center  for  Sponsored  Coastal  Ocean  Re-
search (CSCOR) and the Office of Naval Research (ONR)
• Monitoring  and  Event  Response  for  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  (MERHAB)—
• Coastal Hypoxia Research Program (CHRP)—NOAA
• Interagency Research Efforts on Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia

For  the  past  12  years,  the  science  community  has  been  guided  by  the  National
Plan  for  Marine  Biotoxins  and  Harmful  Algae  (Anderson,  et  al.,  1993).3 This  plan
has  served  as  the  foundation  for  the  development  of  national,  regional,  State  and
local programs and the advancement of scientific knowledge on HABs and their im-
pacts. HABs have increased in their type, frequency, location, duration, and severity
yet  the  decision-making  and  management  systems  have  not  changed.  Thus  the  na-
tional plan has been updated to reflect the current state of the HAB problem, needs,
priorities, and approaches. The new plan, Harmful Algal Research and Response: A
National  Environmental  Science  Strategy  2005–20154 (HARRNESS)  is  composed  of
views from the research and management community and outlines a framework for
actions over a ten-year period.

The  HABs  issue  has  been  approached  at  a  multi-agency  level  because  no  single
agency  has  the  resources  or  mandate  to  address  the  many  dimensions  of  the  HAB
problem.  There  is  presently  a  range  of  programs  and  agencies  that  address  specific
aspects  of  HABs  including:  the  ecology,  the  toxicology,  monitoring,  and  human
health  impacts.  The  new  U.S.  plan,  HARRNESS,  is  designed  to  facilitate  coordina-
tion  by  highlighting  the  needs  and  priorities  of  research  and  management  of  com-
munities.  As  outlined  in  the  plan,  the  major  priorities  and  critical  needs  for  addi-
tional capability and understanding fall into four thematic areas:

1. Bloom ecology and dynamics
2. Toxins and their effects
3. Food webs and fisheries
4. Public heath and socioeconomic impacts

In addition to the programs listed above, there are several other national research

programs that support research on HABs:

• NSF/NIEHS Oceans and Human Health Initiative
• National Sea Grant College Program

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Good  morning.  I  want  to  welcome  everyone
to  today’s  hearing  on  harmful  algal  blooms,  HABs,  and  how  these
HABs  are  impacting  our  coastlines,  marine  and  freshwaters.  Our
marine  and  freshwaters  are  overflowing  with  life.  However,  under
the  right  conditions,  some  of  the  naturally  occurring  microorga-
nisms found in these waters can create toxic conditions.

Harmful algal blooms can cause a tremendous amount of damage
through  the  production  of  toxins  and  by  reducing  oxygen  in  the
water.  Many  of  our  coastal  areas  and  the  Great  Lakes  are  experi-
encing the impact of these blooms. These impact include alteration
of  the  ocean’s  food  web,  human  illnesses  and  economic  losses  to
coastal  communities  and  commercial  fisheries.  Our  Texas  Parks
and  Wildlife  Department  monitors  these  blooms  to  communicate
pollution  threats  to  the  public.  They  have  continued  to  work  hard
to  respond  to  incidents  where  fish  and  other  animals  have  been
harmed.

The  research  and  response  needs  for  the  United  States  have
grown  since  the  last  reauthorization  of  the  Harmful  Algal  Bloom
and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 2004. There has been an
increase  in  the  number,  frequency  and  type  of  HABs  in  recent
years.

We  need  to  use  the  advances  in  our  understanding  of  these
blooms  to  better  predict  their  occurrence  and  to  prevent  them,  if
possible. Fishery and beach closures are very costly events that can
devastate  the  economies  of  coastal  communities.  We  have  a  distin-
guished panel of witnesses here today and I hope they will offer us
recommendations  on  how  we  can  improve  the  prevention,  control
and  management  of  harmful  algal  blooms.  I  want  to  thank  all  of
our witnesses for being here today

[The prepared statement of Chairman Lampson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

Good  morning.  I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  today’s  hearing  on  Harmful  Algal
Blooms  (HABs)  and  how  HABs  are  impacting  our  coastlines,  marine,  and
freshwaters.

Our  marine  and  freshwaters  are  overflowing  with  life.  However  under  the  right
conditions  some  of  the  naturally  occurring  microorganisms  found  in  these  waters
can create toxic conditions.

Harmful algal blooms can cause a tremendous amount of damage through the pro-

duction of toxins and by reducing oxygen in the water.

Many  of  our  coastal  areas  and  the  Great  Lakes  are  experiencing  the  impacts  of
these  blooms.  These  impacts  include  alteration  of  the  ocean’s  food  web,  human  ill-
nesses, and economic losses to coastal communities and commercial fisheries.

Our Texas Parks and Wildlife Department monitors these blooms to communicate
pollution threats to the public. They have continued to work hard to respond to inci-
dents where fish and other animals have been harmed.

The research and response needs for the U.S. have grown since the last reauthor-
ization of the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act in 2004.
There  has  been  an  increase  in  the  number,  frequency,  and  type  of  HABs  in  recent
years.

We need to use the advances in our understanding of these blooms to better pre-
dict  their  occurrence  and  prevent  them,  if  possible.  Fishery  and  beach  closures  are
very costly events that can devastate the economies of coastal communities.

We have a distinguished panel of witnesses here today, and I hope they will offer
us  recommendations  on  how  we  can  improve  the  prevention,  control  and  manage-
ment of Harmful Algal Blooms.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  At  this  time  I  would  like  to  recognize  actu-
ally  not  the  Ranking  Member  of  the  Committee  but  the  Ranking
Member of the Full Committee, Mr. Hall.

Mr.  HALL.  I  thank  my  friend,  fellow  Texan,  and  I  have  a  state-
ment  and  I  would  ask  unanimous  consent  to  place  it  in  the  record
and not take the time.

Chairman LAMPSON. So ordered.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

I  have  to  admit,  we  don’t  get  many  harmful  algal  blooms  in  my  district.  We  are
usually  more  concerned  with  drought  than  with  excess,  stagnant  water.  Neverthe-
less, harmful algal blooms have detrimental effects on our coastal communities and
these  effects  can  be  felt  even  up  in  the  4th  district  with  higher  prices  or  limited
selections of seafood.

The 105th and the 108th Congresses enacted legislation that directs NOAA to put
together a national policy on research of harmful algal blooms and outline potential
mitigation strategies. I am happy to know that such plans are now in place and will
help coordinate the Federal Government’s efforts on algae research. I hope that they
have remembered the Department of Energy’s research program on fuel from algae
several  decades  ago,  and  that  this  outside-the-box  thinking  is  characteristic  of  our
national  strategy  on  dealing  with  harmful  algal  blooms.  Sometimes  environmental
problems can have a silver lining, and I hope that our scientists look for that lining
in addition to looking for a cure.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  distinguished  panelists  about  what  research
is  currently  going  on,  and  what  is  planned  for  the  future.  Thank  you  again,  and  I
yield back the balance of my time.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  If  there  are  additional  opening  statements,

they will be placed in the record at this point.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Inglis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Thank you for holding this hearing, Mr. Chairman.
South  Carolina  is  home  to  the  Phytoplankton  Monitoring  Network,  an  outreach
tool  that  unites  the  community  in  monitoring  marine  phytoplankton  and  harmful
algal blooms. This network has grown to include educators and scientists in several
states such as North Carolina, Georgia, Florida in the Southeast, to as far away as
Hawaii,  the  Virgin  Islands,  Massachusetts,  and  Alaska.  This  network  has  reported
more  than  70  blooms  since  it  started  in  2001,  quite  a  feat  for  an  all  volunteer  net-
work!

However,  this  monitoring  program  would  be  useless  without  simultaneous  re-
search  on  harmful  algal  blooms,  how  to  mitigate  their  adverse  effects  and  adapt  to
their  presence.  In  the  last  ten  years,  Congress  has  enacted  legislation  for  research
on  harmful  algal  blooms  and  directed  NOAA  to  develop  strategies  on  how  to  miti-
gate  them.  I  am  pleased  that  so  much  progress  has  been  made  since  we  passed
these  laws.  I  know  there  is  still  much  to  be  done,  particularly  on  the  freshwater
side.  I  hope  our  witnesses  will  give  us  insight  on  how  we  can  address  the  short-
comings in existing law.

I look forward hearing from our distinguished witnesses, and I yield back the re-

mainder of my time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the Subcommittee giving attention to this matter and

holding a hearing on the recent trends of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs).

As  you  know,  Mr.  Chairman,  this  is  not  the  first  time  this  committee  has  looked
at  this  issue;  unfortunately  however,  HABs  continue  to  adversely  affect  our  coasts,
oceans and Great Lakes. Whereas before, HABs only affected select locations in the
United States, more recent trends have touched virtually every coastal state.

As a life-long resident of a Great Lakes state, I am well aware of the importance
of  these  vital  natural  resources  to  the  economic  health  and  well  being  of  our  state.
Whether as a source of drinking water for our largest cities, a major transportation

corridor  for  the  movement  of  goods  and  services,  or  as  a  center  for  recreation,  the
Great  Lakes  are  integral  to  the  regional  economies  and  livelihood  of  those  states
that line their shores.

I am pleased we continue to examine and explore these issues as there are signifi-
cant  policy  and  organizational  challenges  that  remain  in  this  nation’s  efforts  to  re-
store  and  protect  our  natural  resources.  We  must  build  upon  the  2004  expansion
of  the  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  and  Hypoxia  Amendments  Act  of  2004  to  help  coordi-
nate organizational efforts to combat HABs harmful effects.

I welcome the witnesses here today, and look forward to their testimony.

Panel I:

Chairman  LAMPSON.  At  this  time  I  am  pleased  to  introduce  our
first  panel  of  witnesses.  We  have  two  of  our  colleagues  from  Flor-
ida—well,  we  have  one  of  our  colleagues  from  Florida  with  us
today,  Representative  Connie  Mack.  We  may  be  joined  by  Rep-
resentative  Allen  Boyd.  Congressman  Mack,  you  are  recognized  to
make your statement.

STATEMENT OF HON. CONNIE MACK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN

CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

ceed.

Mr.  MACK.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  if  it  is  okay  with  the
Committee  and  the  Chairman,  I  have  my  written  statement  that
I  would  like  to  submit  to  the  Committee,  but  if  it  is  all  right  with
the  Committee,  I  would  like  to  just  talk  openly  about  red  tide  and
algal blooms and the effects that they have in my part of the coun-
try and what I think the overall impact is, if that is okay with the
Chairman.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  It  is  absolutely  perfect  with  us.  Please  pro-

Mr.  MACK.  Thank  you.  And  I  am  sure  that  most—I  know  that
most  people  behind  me  and  also  people  on  the  Committee  are
aware  of  the  problems,  and  I  will  refer  to  as  red  tide.  There  are
lots  of  different  names  for  these  algal  blooms  and  the  toxins  that
are  produced  from  them,  but  from  my  perspective  growing  up  in
Southwest  Florida,  we  would  have  a  red  tide  incident  that  would
last  maybe  a  week  a  year,  and  now  we  see  red  tide  off  our  shores
and  approaching  our  coastlines  13  months  in  a  row.  So  obviously
the problem is getting worse.

And as we try to learn more about red tide and the causes of red
tide,  we  always  bump  into  competing  research.  Someone  will  say
that well, research shows that it is not tied to maybe runoff, let us
say, from fertilizers running off into our bodies of water, and others
will  say,  well,  the  science  doesn’t  prove  that  at  all.  And  then  we
get Members of Congress such as myself who would like to go home
and take a couple million dollars and go to our local university and
hopefully  help  them  with  their  research  projects  but  then  we  find
that we end up duplicating research projects.

And  so  one  of  the  things  that  I  have  proposed  and  I  think  we
have four-some co-sponsors on the bill, is to have a peer review re-
search  so  that  when  we  move  forward  with  red  tide  research,  the
monies  are  being  distributed  by  scientists  who  understand  the  re-
search  so  we  don’t  duplicate  research  as  we  move  forward  and
there  is  more  efficiencies.  This  is  not  just  a  Florida  problem.  This
is  all  along  the  coastal  United  States,  also  the  lakes,  and  red  tide,

these  algal  blooms  are  different  in  every  part  of  the  country.  But
we can use, if we can combined our dollars, if we combined our re-
search and our efforts and we let the science and the scientists di-
rect where those dollars are going, we will get a much better prod-
uct.  The  research  will  be  much  more  reliable.  And  from  that  re-
search,  we  can  then  move  into  how  to  better  track  red  tide,  how
to  use  the  research  to  develop  technologies  that  will  limit  the  red
tide  outbreaks.  And  if  you  have  ever  had  the  opportunity  to  visit
southwest Florida, some of the most beautiful beaches, I know, you
know, other parts of the state might disagree, but some of the most
beautiful  beaches  in  the  country  or  in  the  world,  but  when  you
have  a  red  tide  event,  people  have  a  hard  time  breathing.  It  runs
people  out  of  our  hotels.  The  economy  suffers  and  there  is  a  last-
ing—a long-lasting impact to the citizens of southwest Florida who
have  a  hard  time  breathing  and  their  eyes  will  swell  and  tear  up
and it is very uncomfortable. I am encouraged that the Committee
is  again  looking  at  how  we  move  forward,  how  do  we  continue  to
have  research  that  is  done  in  a  way  that  is  reliable,  that  is  effi-
cient,  that  we  don’t  waste  taxpayers’  dollars  on  duplicating  of  re-
search,  and  I  think  that  the  Committee  and  the  wisdom  of  the
Committee  will  find  a  way  to  ensure  that  we  use  peer  review  re-
search  instead  of  powerful  Members  of  Congress  fighting  just  for
their  backyard  but  fighting  for  all  of  us  around  the  country  and
taking on red tide.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Mack follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE CONNIE MACK

Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking you and the Committee for hold-
ing  this  important  hearing.  I  appreciate  the  chance  to  testify  on  harmful  algal
blooms  (HABs)  and  how  they  are  affecting  our  nation’s  coastlines,  oceans,  and  in-
land waters. I would also like to thank my friend Mr. Boyd for showing his commit-
ment to this issue. As you all can see this is not a Republican or Democratic matter,
rather, it is one that affects the health of our entire nation.

I  represent  the  coastal  areas  of  Southwest  Florida.  If  you  haven’t  been  there,  it’s
a  beautiful  part  of  the  country,  with  miles  and  miles  of  white  sandy  beaches.  Our
economy hinges in great part on tourism. People love to come to our shores to fish,
to  relax  on  the  beach,  and  to  enjoy  our  unique  way  of  life.  For  Southwest  Florida,
like  many  communities,  a  healthy  environment  and  a  healthy  economy  go  hand-in-
hand.

When  I  was  growing  up  in  Cape  Coral,  Florida,  red  tide  blooms  were  short-lived
nuisances that lasted just a few days. Today, however, red tide blooms continue for
months at a time, and they have drastic and long-lasting implications that threaten
the environment, the economy, people’s health, and our overall quality of life.

It  is  imperative  that  we  do  more  to  understand  and  combat  red  tide  and  other
harmful  algal  blooms.  From  New  England  to  the  Great  Lakes,  from  California  to
South Carolina, these toxic blooms are a national problem that affects us all.

Harmful  algal  blooms  occur  when  algae  produces  toxic  or  harmful  effects  on  peo-
ple,  fish,  shellfish,  marine  mammals,  and  birds.  According  to  the  National  Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), HABs have been reported in almost every
coastal state and within the Great Lakes. These blooms cause dangerous respiratory
distress,  burning  eyes,  and  other  ailments  to  individuals  in  affected  areas,  as  well
as  the  nationwide  potential  of  severe  food  poisoning  from  the  consumption  of  con-
taminated shellfish.

Harmful  algal  blooms  not  only  affect  our  personal  health,  they  also  affect  the
health of our economy. Red tide and other toxic blooms cost approximately $80 mil-
lion  annually  to  communities  across  America.  Since  HABs  are  affected  by  many
variables,  including  weather  and  currents,  it  is  difficult  to  predict  their  location,
timing, or duration. For coastal communities like mine that rely on beaches for tour-
ism, the potential economic losses could be crippling.

Legislation  regarding  these  toxic  blooms  was  first  introduced  in  1998  under  the
Harmful  Algal  Bloom  and  Hypoxia  Research  and  Control  Act  of  1998  (HABHRCA).
This bill authorized appropriations for NOAA to research, monitor, and manage ac-
tivities for the prevention and control of HABs. This law established an inter-agency
task force to develop a comprehensive coordinated federal response to harmful algal
blooms  and  hypoxia.  In  addition,  the  legislation  required  the  task  force  to  submit
annual reports to track the progress and effectiveness of the departments and agen-
cies.

The  HABHRCA  legislation  has  been  reauthorized  several  times,  most  recently  in
the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008. Current law authorizes $30 million per
year  for  the  next  three  years.  Unfortunately,  the  existing  law  passed  through  the
appropriations process, and not through your committee. The Members of this com-
mittee  and  your  staff  understand  and  recognize  the  importance  of  this  issue.  By
bringing it up through regular order and holding the hearing today, your committee
can finally give this issue the attention it deserves.

Last  year  I  introduced  the  Save  Our  Shores  Act  to  increase  our  commitment  to
researching  HABS,  and  to  improve  the  process  by  which  those  research  dollars  are
accounted for and awarded.

Although  existing  law  incorporates  the  increased  funding  levels  within  my  bill,
the  Save  Our  Shores  Act  would  reinforce  the  importance  of  peer-reviewed  research
and strengthen the annual reporting requirements.

While  NOAA  has  recognized  the  importance  of  having  scientists  and  experts  in
the  field  involved  in  the  peer  review  process  to  determine  where  research  money  is
going,  Save  Our  Shores  ensures  that  all  HAB  funding,  not  just  HABHRCA,  would
be awarded on a competitive peer reviewed basis. Additionally, by improving report-
ing  requirements  Congress  and  NOAA  will  be  able  to  measure  the  effectiveness  of
these research efforts.

Finally,  we  need  to  reduce  the  gap  between  authorized  and  appropriated  funds,
to ensure research can be continued. Annual funding has fallen far short of author-
ized levels and we need to close this disparity.

Once  again,  I  commend  the  Committee  for  bringing  up  such  an  important  issue.
The sooner we can understand what factors may contribute to harmful algal blooms,
the  sooner  solutions  can  be  developed  to  save  our  nation’s  coastlines,  oceans,  and
inland waters.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Mack.  We  appreciate  you

being here.

Mr. Boyd, you are recognized.

STATEMENT OF HON. ALLEN BOYD, A REPRESENTATIVE IN

CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

Mr. BOYD. I needed my friend, Connie Mack, to show me how to
turn this thing on. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Representative
Hall  and  the  other  Members  of  the  Committee  for  allowing  us  to
appear  before  you  today,  and  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing,
and  I  apologize  for  being  a  moment  late.  You  know,  most  commit-
tees are a little bit starting on time, Chairman Lampson, but obvi-
ously you are not, and I am grateful for that.

I  am  also  grateful  for  my  friend,  Connie  Mack,  and  his  leader-
ship in this issue, and he is absolutely right that Southwest Florida
has  some  of  the  most  beautiful  beaches  in  the  world.  His  problem
is,  he  doesn’t  have  the  most  beautiful  beaches.  That  is  in  North
Florida  in  areas  like  Panama  City,  Destin,  the  Fort  Walton  area,
an area that we so endearingly call the ‘‘Redneck Riviera.’’

Chairman LAMPSON. They are not on commercials, are they?
Mr.  BOYD.  But  red  tide  has  gotten  to  be  a  very  serious  problem
and  it  has  become  more  severe.  I  know  when  I  was  growing  up,  it
was something we didn’t see very often and we dreaded it when we
did  see  it,  but  in  the  last  15  years  or  so,  we  have  had  maybe  five
or  so  severe  outbreaks,  and  I  think  the  important  thing  to  under-
stand  is  when  that  outbreak  comes,  it  really  renders  the  coastline

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:32 Dec 26, 2008 Jkt 043278 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\071008\43278 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

12

and the use of the coast worthless, not only for commercial activity
like  fishing  because  of  what  it  does  to  the  fish  but  also  it  renders
it  useless  for  human  use.  People  can’t  use  the  coast  when  there  is
red  tide.  So  we  see  that  those  of  us  who  live  in  coastal  areas,  and
in  Florida,  80  percent  of  our  people  do  live  within  12  miles  of  the
coast.  That  is  what  Florida  is  built  on,  is  our  beautiful  coastline.
So  it  does  extreme  damage  to  us  economically  in  addition  to  the
ecosystem environmental damage that is done also.

Specifically,  I  think  in  our  area,  we  have  a  very  aggressively
growing  community  up  in  the  Destin,  Fort  Walton,  Panama  City
area  that  has  turned  into  quite  a  tourist  spot,  but  we  also  have  a
long  and  historical  productive  fishing  industry,  particularly  in  the
Apalachicola Bay area. We are home of the world famous Apalachi-
cola  Bay  oyster,  and  when  the  red  tide  comes  in,  then  all  of  that
is  rendered  useless,  particularly  this  last  outbreak  we  had  after
Katrina.  We  had  an  outbreak  and  then  subsequently  the  drought,
which happened in Georgia, and the reduced amount of freshwater
coming  down  the  Apalachicola  River,  we  weren’t  able  to  flush  that
red tide out and it stayed with an extra long time.

So  those  are  the  kinds  of  problems  that  we  experience  with  the
algal bloom that causes the red tide, and Mr. Chairman, I want to
again thank Connie Mack for his leadership on this issue and also
for  you  and  your  committee  for  holding  this  hearing,  and  we  will
be  glad  to  answer  whatever  questions  that  we  can,  hopefully  with
the understanding that you know that we are not technical experts
on this but we just know how it affects our people and our commu-
nities. Thank you very much.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Boyd follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE ALLEN BOYD

Chairman Lampson and Ranking Member Inglis,

Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  this  important  hearing  to  tell  you  about  the  hard-
ship  that  my  constituents  suffer  every  time  we  have  a  red  tide,  or  Harmful  Algal
Bloom,  outbreak  in  the  Gulf.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  my  friend  Mr.  Mack  for
being a leader on this issue for the Florida Delegation.

When I was growing up, red tide was a very rare occurrence. However, in the last
15 to 20 years, the incidence of red tide has jumped to at least four or five outbreaks
in  that  time  period.  This  has  been  very  hard  on  the  oyster  and  scallop  industries
as well as on the tourism industry in my district and across Florida.

I  represent  North  Florida  along  the  coast  line  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  My  district
has  some  of  the  most  famous  and  beautiful  beaches  in  the  country  as  well  as  an
important  fishing  industry  and  pristine  natural,  protected  environments.  Our  local
economies, our environment, and our very way of life are threatened every time the
algal blooms near the coastline.

The  most  recent  incidence  of  harmful  algal  blooms  was  in  2005  after  Hurricane
Katrina.  As  you  all  probably  know,  red  tide  originates  out  in  the  Gulf.  Hurricanes
and  storms  push  it  in  to  the  estuaries  where  the  damage  to  wildlife  is  enormous.
One area in my district, Franklin County, produces oysters and was hit particularly
hard then. This affects the entire oyster industry because Apalachicola Bay provides
90 percent of the state’s oysters.

The  toxins  released  by  these  harmful  blooms  have  a  particular  affect  on  ‘‘filter-
feeders.’’  Filter  feeders  are  fish  like  oysters  or  scallops  that  absorb  the  waters  and
filter  out  the  microscopic  organisms.  If  eaten,  they  can  cause  a  person  to  become
very ill.

As  the  hurricane  pushed  the  red  tide  into  the  Apalachicola  Bay,  it  was  trapped
in  the  enclosure  of  the  Bay  and  slow  moving  water.  With  drought  above  Florida  in
Georgia, water was not flowing down to the Bay and the entire area had to be closed
because we could not flush out the algal blooms with freshwater.

13

Unfortunately  the  affects  of  red  tide  are  not  felt  only  by  the  fish.  Along  with  the
rich  natural  resources  that  Florida  is  known  for,  we  are  also  known  as  a  very  pop-
ular  tourist  destination.  The  toxins  released  by  the  blooms  can  lead  to  respiratory
and  eye  problems  in  people  who  are  exposed.  So  you  can  see  how  the  yearly  out-
breaks  of  red  tide  in  the  Gulf  can  affect  the  $53  billion  dollar  tourist  industry  in
my state.

For  example,  during  the  primary  months  for  oyster  harvest,  September–Decem-
ber,  through  three  previous  years,  red  tides  have  forced  closures  of  the  oyster  beds
in  Apalachicola  Bay  for  well  over  50  percent  of  the  season  (Table).  Total  damages
from  lost  production  of  seafood,  canceled  reservations,  regional  defamation  and  res-
piratory illnesses exceeds multi-millions per year.

In conclusion, the economic welfare of coastal communities, seafood commerce and
public  health  about  Apalachicola  Bay,  Florida  remains  vulnerable  to  increasing  oc-
currences  of  potentially  toxic  red  tides.  The  adverse  occurrence  is  currently  unpre-
dictable and difficult to resolve in terms of controls and monitoring methods for res-
olution. The consequences restrict harvest of valuable seafood, devalue coastal prop-
erties and deter tourism.

This  situation  is  anticipated  to  increase  with  the  diminishing  flow  of  freshwaters
from the northern reserves that are necessary to maintain Bay water salinities lev-
els  that  are  less  favorable  for  red  tides.  It  is  imperative  to  all  of  the  states  around
the  Gulf  of  Mexico  to  learn  more  about  this  harmful  bloom.  Many  vital  industries
and the fragile ecosystem rely on us coming to a better understanding of where this
bloom  originates  and  how  we  can  prevent  it  from  further  damaging  our  environ-
ment.

Thank  you  again  for  your  attention  to  this  issue  Mr.  Chairman.  I  stand  ready  to
work with you in whatever way I can, so that we can ultimately develop responsible
and effective methods to predict and detect red tide.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Boyd  and  Mr.

Mack.

Are there any questions of this panel? We have got some experts
that  are  sitting  behind  them  that  we  are  going  to  be  hearing  from
but  we  have  time  for  questions  if  anyone  wants  to  now.  Yes,  sir?
Mr.  HALL.  I  would  just  say  it  is  an  exceptional  panel  here  that
are  here  with  similar  problems  of  a  mutual  state,  and  I  like  the
way  they  rag  on  their  particular  districts  because  I  am  reminded
that  Pike’s  Peak  is  not  by  far  the  highest  peak  over  in  that  area.
There  are  four  or  five  other  higher  peaks  but  if  Pike’s  Peak  is  the
one  that  that  Congressman  brags  about,  then  that’s  where  every-
body goes. So maybe even of you have a Pike’s Peak in your district
but  all  the  parts  of  Florida  that  I  ever  visited  are  just  absolutely
breathtaking,  and  I  have  great  opportunity  to  be  with  you,  Mr.
Boyd,  almost  once  a  year  for  the  last  several  years  and  you  are  a
gracious host and you represent a beautiful part of the country. My
first  home  during  World  War  II  was  Daytona  Beach,  Florida,  and
my wife and I always intended to go back there, but, you know, you
can’t do that when you have families at home and fathers and par-
ents  and  all,  but  it  is  a  great  state.  You  do  a  good  job.  Thank  you
for coming before the Committee.

Mr.  BOYD.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  might  thank  my  friend,  Ralph
Hall,  for  those  comments,  and  Connie  Mack  and  I  certainly  would
agree  that  the  Atlantic  coast  is  the  second  most  beautiful  coast  in
the State of Florida with the Gulf of Mexico being first.

Mr. MACK. I would agree with that.
Chairman LAMPSON. They are together on something. You know,
I  would  question  as  to  whether  or  not  the  best  fishing  is  in  the
eastern Gulf or the western Gulf, but we won’t get into that either
today.

Mr.  MACK.  Well,  since  you  brought  it  up,  Mr.  Chairman,  it  de-

pends on what you are fishing for.

Chairman LAMPSON. That is very true.
Mr.  MACK.  On  a  serious  note,  I  know  that  the—I  had  an  oppor-
tunity  to  talk  to  Members  of  the  Committee  and  I  know  that  you
are  going  to  hear  from  the  experts  on  this,  and  I  am  fortunate
enough  to  have  had  the  ability  to  have  many  conversations  with
who  I  believe  are  the  experts,  and  I  think  my  colleagues  recognize
the need for us to once again move forward with the ability to have
research that is meaningful because research is what we rely upon
to  develop  the  technologies  to  protect  our  waterways  from  these
toxins, and so I am very honored to be here and to have the oppor-
tunity  to  speak,  but  I  really  look  forward  to  you  hearing  from  the
experts as well.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  We  thank  you  both  for  being  here,  and
clearly  it  is  a  huge  issue.  It  affects  the  food  chain,  it  affects  our
tourism activities, it affects the economy significantly, and we hope
we come up with some of the right conclusions. So thank you both
for joining us today.

We will take a very short break as the next panel takes its place

at the table and we will begin very shortly.

Panel II:

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  want  to  welcome  our  second  panel  of  wit-
nesses. Dr. Robert Magnien is the Director of the National Oceanic
and  Atmospheric  Administration  Center  for  Sponsored  Coastal
Ocean  Research.  Dr.  Donald  Anderson  is  Senior  Scientist  and  Di-
rector of the Coastal Ocean Institute at Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution.  I  am  going  to  skip  Dr.  Ayres  for  just  one  second  and
I  will  go  to  Dr.  Kenneth  Hudnell,  who  is  the  Vice  President  and
Director  of  Science  at  SolarBee  Incorporated.  And  I  would  call  on
our colleague, Mr. Baird, to make an introduction.

Mr. BAIRD. I am just pleased to have Dr. Dan Ayres here, Coast-
al Shellfish Manager and Lead Biologist for Washington State’s De-
partment  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  Region  Six.  My  dear  friends  from
Florida  spoke  earlier,  but  as  Dan  knows,  we  have  harmful  algal
blooms off our coast in the Puget Sound as well and Dan has been
a real leader in trying to deal with those, and I am glad he is here.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Baird.
You will each have five minutes for your spoken testimony. Your
written  testimony  will  be  included  in  the  record  for  the  hearing,
and  when  you  all  complete  your  testimony,  we  will  begin  with
questions.  Each  Member  will  have  five  minutes  to  question  the
panel.

Dr. Magnien, you may begin.

STATEMENT OF DR. ROBERT E. MAGNIEN, DIRECTOR, CENTER
FOR  SPONSORED  COASTAL  OCEAN  SCIENCE,  NATIONAL
CENTERS  FOR  COASTAL  OCEAN  SCIENCE,  NATIONAL  OCE-
ANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA)
Dr. MAGNIEN. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Members of the
Subcommittee.  My  name  is  Robert  Magnien  and  I  am  Director  of
NOAA’s  Center  for  Sponsored  Coastal  Ocean  Research.  My  center
is  responsible  for  administering  the  competitive  research  program
called  for  in  the  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  and  Hypoxia  Research  Con-
trol Act, also known as HABHRCA, which includes the only two na-
tional  programs  devoted  solely  to  harmful  algal  bloom  research,
and you will hear me refer to harmful algal blooms as HABs in the
rest  of  my  testimony.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  discuss
NOAA’s  role  in  the  national  response  to  HABs  in  our  coastal  wa-
ters  and  our  Great  Lakes.  I  will  briefly  discuss  what  HABs  are,
highlight  NOAA’s  approach  to  this  problem  and  touch  on  some  of
our accomplishments to date.

Harmful algae are often invisible microscopic organisms but they
can also appear as visible scums or be seaweed-like. Some harmful
algae  produce  potent  toxins  that  cause  illnesses  or  death  in  hu-
mans  and  marine  life  including  fish,  sea  birds  and  marine  mam-
mals. Humans and animals can be exposed to algal toxins from the
food  they  eat,  the  water  they  drink  or  swim  in  or  the  air  they
breathe.  Other  algae  harm  ecosystems  by  smothering  valuable
habitat such as corals or grow to such proportions that their subse-
quent  decomposition  depletes  all  life-giving  oxygen  in  the  water,
thus killing most of the resident organisms.

HAB events have been increasing in frequency and now affect all
major regions in the United States and the Great Lakes to varying
extents from year to year. The widespread occurrence and diversity
of  blooms  challenges  our  ability  to  keep  pace  with  the  needs  of
coastal managers to protect human health and local economies. Re-
ports  just  days  ago  of  people  being  hospitalized  in  New  England
from eating tainted shellfish show how real these threats are.

Our  approach  in  NOAA  to  these  problems  are  national  in  scope.
They  are  targeted  to  the  different  regional  needs  and  they  are  rel-
evant at the State level where managers are on the front lines and
need  new  tools  and  knowledge  to  efficiently  and  effectively  combat
existing  and  emerging  threats.  Partnerships  with  State  managers
like  Mr.  Ayres  and  research  scientists  like  Dr.  Anderson,  who  will
address  you  shortly,  bring  a  wealth  of  expertise  to  our  HAB  pro-
grams  and  keep  us  focused  on  the  management  needs.  Coordi-
nating  and  collaborating  between  programs  within  NOAA  and
other  federal  agencies  ensures  broad  engagement  and  efficient  use
of  our  resources  in  addressing  these  difficult  problems.  As  our  re-
search  programs  yield  valuable  products,  we  are  transferring  this
knowledge to operational programs in NOAA as well as supporting
the transferred adoption of successful technologies to sustained op-
erations at State agencies or other local or regional entities.

We  have  a  long  record  of  accomplishments  since  the  passage  of
HABHRCA  in  1998  in  virtually  every  coastal  state  including  im-
proved HAB monitoring and detection capabilities, identification of
methods  to  prevent  the  development  of  blooms,  and  forecasts  to
provide  more  efficient  and  comprehensive  ways  of  assisting  State
managers and warning the public of potential exposure. I will men-
tion only three examples to provide a sense of the progress we have
made together with our partners.

NOAA  has  developed  a  satellite-based  warning  system  for  the
devastating  red  tides  in  Florida,  which  you  just  heard  about.  This
is the HAB bulletin that comes out twice a week and forecasts the
progression  of  red  tide  and  gives  local  managers  a  heads  up.  We
are hoping to expand that system to Texas and then eventually go
national  with  this  system.  A  NOAA-funded  monitoring  system  off
Texas  recently  detected  a  rare  HAB  species,  which  alerted  State
public  health  managers  to  this  threat.  Shellfish  harvesting  was
suspended and shellfish recalled just days before the Fulton Oyster
Fest, a major event in the region attended by thousands of people.
Early detection and quick warning prevented human illness, which
could  have  been  a  devastating  blow  to  the  local  shellfish  industry.
The current severe red tide affecting New England states was pre-
dicted  months  in  advance  as  a  result  of  NOAA-funded  research.
The  prediction  and  subsequent  data  being  supplied  in  real  time  is
allowing  State  managers  and  the  shellfish  industry  to  deal  effec-
tively with this difficult situation.

So  in  conclusion,  over  the  last  10  years  we  made  unprecedented
progress in understanding the causes and consequences of harmful
algal  blooms  which  has  led  to  the  development  of  numerous  tools
that  are  already  in  service  and  improving  HAB  management.  We
are  working  hard  to  build  upon  these  successes  by  continuing  to
move  newly  developed  technologies  into  application  and  operation
at  the  national,  regional  and  State  levels,  and  we  also  plan  to

17

spend  additional  effort  with  managers  and  other  partners  to  iden-
tify  critical  future  needs  region  by  region  and  develop  strategic
plans to fill those gaps.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  on  behalf  of  NOAA  on
the  topic  of  HABs,  and  I  will  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions
that you may have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT E. MAGNIEN

Introduction

Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  My  name  is
Robert  E.  Magnien,  Director  of  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administra-
tion’s  (NOAA’s)  Center  for  Sponsored  Coastal  Ocean  Research  (CSCOR).  CSCOR
provides  extramural  funding  for  multi-disciplinary  research  focused  on  under-
standing  and  predicting  the  impacts  of  natural  and  anthropogenic  influences  on
coastal  ecosystems,  communities,  and  economies.  In  this  capacity,  I  administer  the
only  two  national  programs  solely  focused  on  harmful  algal  blooms  (HABs):  the
interagency  Ecology  and  Oceanography  of  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  (ECOHAB)  Pro-
gram  and  NOAA’s  Monitoring  and  Event  Response  for  Harmful  Algal  Blooms
(MERHAB)  Program,  which  are  authorized  by  the  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  and  Hy-
poxia  Research  and  Control  Act  of  1998  (HABHRCA).  I  also  serve  on  the  Inter-
agency  Working  Group  on  HABs,  Hypoxia,  and  Human  Health  (IWG–4H),  which,
among  other  responsibilities,  implements  the  reporting  requirements  of  HABHRCA
2004.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  discuss  NOAA’s  role  in  addressing  HABs  in
our  coastal  waters  and  the  Great  Lakes.  I  will  highlight  the  advances  NOAA’s  ef-
forts  have  made  in  improving  HAB  management  and  discuss  how  we  plan  to  build
on our early successes.

HAB Problem

Algae  are  simple  plants  that,  in  general,  are  beneficial  because  they  provide  the
main source of energy that sustains marine and aquatic life. However, a small per-
centage of algae cause harm to humans, animals, and the environment by producing
toxins  or  by  growing  in  excessively  large  numbers.  When  this  occurs  they  are  re-
ferred to as ‘‘harmful algal blooms’’ or HABs. When these algae are present in such
high  numbers  that  they  discolor  the  water,  HABs  are  sometimes  called  ‘‘red  tides,’’
‘‘brown  tides,’’  etc.,  but  not  all  HABs  cause  water  discoloration.  Table  1  lists  some
of the major HAB organisms in the United States.

Some  harmful  algae  produce  potent  toxins  that  cause  illness  or  death  in  humans
and  other  organisms—fish,  seabirds,  manatees,  sea  lions,  turtles,  and  dolphins  are
some  commonly  affected  animals.  Humans  and  other  animals  can  be  exposed  to
algal  toxins  through  the  food  they  eat,  the  water  they  drink  or  swim  in,  or  the  air
that  they  breathe.  Other  harmful  algae  are  nontoxic  to  humans  and  wildlife  but
form  such  large  blooms  that  they  degrade  habitat  quality  through  massive  over-
growth, shading, or oxygen depletion (hypoxia). These high biomass blooms can also
be a nuisance to humans when masses of algae accumulate along beaches and sub-
sequently decay.

HABs  can  have  major  negative  impacts  on  local  economies  when,  for  example,
shellfish  harvesting  is  restricted  to  protect  human  health  or  when  tourism  declines
due  to  degradation  of  recreational  resources.  HABs  can  also  result  in  significant
public health costs when humans become ill. A recent conservative assessment esti-
mates that HABs occurring in marine waters alone have an average annual impact
of  $82  million  dollars  in  the  United  States.1 We  know  that  local  impacts  of  single
events can be large, sometimes larger than the average annual impact. For example,
in  2005,  we  saw  $18  million  in  lost  shellfish  sales  in  Massachusetts  alone.2 Eco-
nomic  impacts  can  be  difficult  to  calculate  as  they  vary  from  region  to  region  and
event  to  event,  but  they  are  a  primary  concern  of  coastal  communities  that  experi-
ence HAB events.

The  public  health,  ecosystem,  and  economic  impacts  can  all  have  social  and  cul-
tural  consequences.  For  example,  along  the  Washington  and  Oregon  coasts,  tens  of
thousands  of  people  visit  annually  to  harvest  razor  clams  recreationally  whenever
the beaches are opened but, due to high levels of the HAB toxin domoic acid, there
have  been  a  number  of  closures  to  the  recreational  fishery  in  recent  years.  These
closures have not only resulted in economic losses, but also in an erosion of commu-
nity identity, community recreation, and a traditional way of living for native coast-
al cultures.

The geographic distribution of HAB events in the United States is broad. For ex-
ample, all coastal states have experienced HAB events over the last decade (see map
of  HAB  events).  Moreover,  the  problem  is  not  limited  to  the  marine  coasts  of  the
United  States,  as  freshwater  HABs  occur  in  the  Great  Lakes  and  in  many  inland
waters.  Evidence  indicates  that  the  frequency  and  distribution  of  these  events  and
their  impacts  have  increased  considerably  in  recent  years  in  the  United  States  and
globally.3

Although  all  coastal  states  experience  HABs,  the  specific  organisms  responsible
for  the  HABs  differ  among  regions  of  the  country  (see  HAB  map).  As  a  result  the
harmful  impacts  vary  in  their  scope  and  severity,  which  leads  to  the  need  for  spe-
cific management approaches for each region and problem. Some species need to be
present  in  very  high  abundance  before  harmful  effects  occur  making  them  easy  to
detect  and  track.  Others  cause  problems  at  very  low  concentrations  and  can  in  es-
sence be hidden among other benign algae, so they are difficult to detect and track.
The  factors  that  cause  and  control  blooms  from  initiation  to  decline  vary  not  only
by species, but also by region due to differences in coastlines, runoff, oceanography,
nutrient  regime,  other  organisms  present  in  the  water,  etc.  Consequently,  devel-
oping strategies for HAB management requires a regional approach.

The causes of HABs are complex. Not only do they vary between species and loca-
tions but they are not all well understood. In general, algal species grow best when
environmental  conditions  (such  as  temperature,  salinity,  and  availability  of  nutri-
ents  and  light)  are  optimal  for  cell  growth.  Other  biological  and  physical  processes
determine  if  enhanced  cell  growth  will  result  in  biomass  accumulation  (or  what  we

call a ‘‘bloom’’). The challenge for understanding the causes of HABs stems from the
complexity of these biological, chemical, and physical interactions and their variable
influence on growth and bloom development among different HAB species. The com-
plexity  of  interactions  between  HABs,  the  environment,  and  other  plankton  com-
plicate the predictions of when and where HAB events will occur. Knowledge of how
all these factors control the initiation, sustainment, and decline of a bloom is a crit-
ical precursor for advancing HAB management.

Human  activities  are  thought  to  contribute  to  the  increased  frequency  of  some
HABs.3 For example, increased nutrient pollution has been acknowledged as a likely
factor  contributing  to  increased  occurrence  of  several  high  biomass  HABs.  Other
human-induced  environmental  changes  that  may  foster  development  of  certain
HABs  include  changes  in  the  types  of  nutrients  entering  coastal  waters,  alteration
of food webs by overfishing, introductions of non-indigenous species that change food
web  structure,  introduction  of  HAB  cells  to  new  areas  via  ballast  water  or  other
mechanisms,  and  modifications  to  water  flow.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  climate
change will almost certainly influence HAB dynamics in some way since many crit-
ical processes governing HAB dynamics—such as temperature, water column strati-
fication,  upwelling  and  ocean  circulation  patterns,  and  freshwater  and  land-derived
nutrient  inputs—are  influenced  by  climate.  The  interactive  role  of  climate  change
with  the  other  factors  driving  the  frequency  and  severity  of  HABs  is  an  important
topic  in  the  early  stages  of  research,  but  climate  change  is  expected  to  exacerbate
the HAB problem in some regions.4

NOAA HAB Programs

The long-term goal of NOAA’s HAB programs is to prevent, control, and mitigate
HABs  and  their  impacts  in  U.S.  coastal  waters,  including  the  Great  Lakes.  Since
most  HAB  impacts  are  managed  at  the  State  and  local  level,  achieving  this  goal  is
mainly  accomplished  by  providing  State  and  local  coastal  and  public  health  man-
agers  and  local  communities  with  the  information  and  tools  they  need  to  protect
human  health,  ecosystem  health,  and  coastal  economies.  NOAA,  through  its  HAB
research  and  partnerships  with  academic  institutions  as  well  as  other  efforts  in  co-
ordination with multiple agencies, is developing tools and applications to assist local
decision-makers. A few examples include:

• more accurate methodologies for detecting and tracking HAB cells and toxins
that  allow  managers  to  assess  more  quickly,  and  cost-effectively,  the  mag-
nitude of a HAB event;
• models  for  forecasting  when  and  where  HABs  will  occur  and  testing  preven-
• methods  of  diagnosing  and  treating  toxin  exposure  in  animals  and  humans;
• risk  communication  and  prevention  strategies  based  on  economic  analyses
• public education and awareness resources and materials.

and risk assessments for human, animal, and ecosystem health; and

tion strategies;

These efforts are guided in part by two strategic plans: (1) HARRNESS: National
Plan  for  Algal  Toxins  and  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  and  (2)  Harmful  Algal  Research
and  Response:  A  Human  Dimensions  Strategy,  which  have  both  provided  direction
for  NOAA’s  HAB  research  and  management  strategies.  Developing  useful  products
for HAB management is a multi-step process that requires a variety of approaches,
all  of  which  require  a  strong  scientific  understanding  of  the  causes  and  impacts  of
HABs.

NOAA  leads  two  programs  solely  focused  on  HABs:  the  interagency  Ecology  and
Oceanography  of  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  (ECOHAB)  Program  and  the  NOAA  Moni-
toring  and  Event  Response  for  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  (MERHAB)  Program,  both  of
which  were  authorized  by  HABHRCA.  ECOHAB  is  a  competitive  research  program
focused on determining the causes and impacts of HABs. The information and tools
ECOHAB provides are necessary for developing technologies for, and approaches to,
predicting, preventing, monitoring and controlling HABs. MERHAB is a competitive
research  program  that  focuses  on  incorporating  tools,  approaches,  and  technologies
from  HAB  research  programs  into  existing  HAB  monitoring  programs.  MERHAB
also  establishes  partnerships  to  enhance  existing  and  initiate  new  HAB  monitoring

capabilities  to  provide  managers  with  timely  information  needed  to  mitigate  HAB
impacts on coastal communities.

Numerous  other  programs  within  NOAA  also  address  HAB  problems  as  part  of
their specific legislative mandate. These include the Oceans and Human Health Ini-
tiative,  Sea  Grant,  the  Office  of  Protected  Resources,  fisheries  management  pro-
grams, the Integrated Ocean Observing System Program, and numerous NOAA labs
and  centers  that  conduct  intramural  research.  There  is  close  collaboration  between
all  of  these  programs.  Many  of  NOAA’s  research  accomplishments  have  resulted
from the efforts of more than one NOAA program.

Other  agencies  also  contribute  substantially  to  improving  HAB  research  and  re-
sponse.  These  include  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration,  the  Environmental  Pro-
tection  Agency  (EPA),  the  National  Science  Foundation,  the  National  Institute  of
Environmental  Health  Sciences,  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administra-
tion,  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control,  and  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey.  Interagency
coordination  is  provided  by  the  IWG–4H,  which  has  taken  on  the  functions  of  the
HAB  Task  Force,  designated  in  HABHRCA.  Interagency  coordination  has  improved
considerably  since  the  IWG–4H  was  established  under  the  direction  of  the  U.S.
Ocean Action Plan governance structure, through the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean
Science and Technology.

Accomplishments Since 1998

The passage of HABHRCA in 1998 marked the formal beginning of NOAA’s HAB
programs,  although  some  efforts  were  already  underway.  In  the  following  10  years
there have been many accomplishments that have improved HAB management and
response  in  virtually  every  coastal  state.  Below  are  just  a  few  examples  that  high-
light the benefits of NOAA’s HAB research.

In  April  2008,  NOAA-funded  researchers  predicted  a  severe  outbreak  of
Alexandrium  fundyense  off  the  New  England  coast.  This  organism  produces  potent
neurotoxins  that  are  filtered  by  shellfish.  When  humans  consume  contaminated
shellfish  they  become  extremely  ill  and  can  die  without  immediate  medical  treat-
ment.  To  prevent  human  health  illness  and  death,  states  in  the  region  have  exten-
sive,  rigorous  shellfish  toxin  monitoring  programs.  When  toxins  in  shellfish  reach
regulatory  limits  in  a  particular  region,  both  commercial  and  recreational  harvests
are closed.

The  2008  prediction  was  derived  from  a  model,  based  on  10  years  of  ecosystem
research in the Gulf of Maine. The prediction was remarkably accurate, but the se-
verity  of  the  event  cannot  be  fully  assessed  until  the  end  of  the  HAB  season.  The
prediction allows State managers and the shellfish aquaculture industry to plan for
a  difficult  season.  By  showing  the  news  media  and  the  public  that  the  event  was
expected  and  State  managers  were  prepared,  the  prediction  may  have  also  reduced
the  ‘‘halo’’  effect  in  which  shellfish  harvesting  closures  in  one  area  reduce  shellfish
and fish sales from areas unaffected by toxicity. Subsequent weekly predictions and
survey  cruises  have  provided  managers  with  information  about  the  location  of  high
numbers  of  toxic  cells  and  where  they  are  likely  to  be  transported  by  currents  in
the next few days, helping them to monitor more efficiently and effectively. A simple
listserv  for  State  and  federal  managers  and  researchers  keeps  everyone  from  the
Bay  of  Fundy  to  the  southern  New  England  states  informed  about  the  progress  of
the event.

Florida’s  harmful  algal  blooms  are  typically  red  tides  caused  by  an  organism
called  Karenia  brevis,  which  produces  a  very  different  neurotoxin  than  that  found
in the species that causes the New England blooms. Blooms occur most often along
the west Florida coast, but also in the Panhandle and occasionally on the east coast
of  Florida.  Besides  contaminating  shellfish,  resulting  in  harvest  closures  to  protect
public  health,  Karenia  blooms  also  cause  massive  fish,  bird,  turtle,  and  marine
mammal  mortalities.  In  addition,  the  toxin  can  be  suspended  in  the  air  as  an  aer-
osol  along  beaches  and  in  near-shore  areas,  causing  irritation  of  the  throats  and
eyes of beach-goers. In extreme cases severe respiratory problems can result and re-
quire  hospitalization.  Recent  research  shows  that  instead  of  one  species,  Karenia
brevis,  there  are  multiple  Karenia  species  that  produce  HABs,  and  which  differ  in
types  of  toxins  and  conditions  favoring  growth.  Research  is  underway  to  develop
quick  methods  and  sensors  that  can  be  deployed  on  moorings  to  identify  these  spe-
cies.

A  Florida  HAB  Bulletin  is  issued  twice  a  week  by  NOAA,  providing  the  location
of  current  blooms,  as  determined  by  satellites,  and  forecasting  transport  and  im-
pacts over the next few days. A pilot project, funded by the State of Florida, is cur-
rently  linking  lifeguard  observations  to  the  HAB  Bulletin,  to  provide  beach-goers
with real time information about beach conditions.

Many  methods  for  detecting  Karenia  brevis  and  its  toxins  have  been  developed
with NOAA funding, for use in different applications. A quick test for the toxins has
been  developed  and  is  now  undergoing  approval  for  use  as  an  official  monitoring
method for public health. This test has also been instrumental in investigating dol-
phin and manatee mortality events, leading to the discovery of unusual toxin expo-
sure  pathways  in  both  organisms.  Additionally,  an  autonomous  underwater  glider
has been developed that can optically map the distribution of Karenia below the sur-
face and send the data back to shore-based labs.

Several  large  regional  studies  have  produced  a  model  that,  along  with  observa-
tions,  is  being  used  to  determine  the  environmental  factors  that  contribute  to
blooms. In particular there is a debate currently about the source of nutrients fuel-
ing  these  recurring  blooms.  If  land-based  nutrient  pollution  is  an  important  cause,
it may be possible to reduce or prevent blooms by reducing nutrient inputs.

NOAA  and  other  agencies  have  also  funded  studies  to  investigate  both  physical
and biological methods of controlling Karenia blooms. A pilot project in the field has
shown  that  spraying  a  clay  suspension  on  a  bloom  is  highly  effective  in  causing  a
bloom to sink to the bottom. The control of blooms by both naturally occurring bac-
teria  and  viruses  has  also  been  investigated.  No  suitable  viruses  were  found,  but
several  algicidal  bacteria  were  found  that  killed  Karenia  in  laboratory  cultures.
These  studies  hold  great  promise  for  future  HAB  control  strategies,  and  follow  up
research would be a priority topic in NOAA competitions.

Karenia brevis blooms also occur in Texas coastal waters, although much less fre-
quently than in Florida. A Texas HAB Bulletin has been provided by NOAA weekly
since  2006  in  a  demonstration/testing  mode,  as  we  reevaluate  our  models  to  incor-
porate  the  specific  oceanographic  conditions  off  Texas.  Because  Karenia  blooms  are
much more sporadic along the Texas coast, routine monitoring is not conducted un-
less an outbreak is occurring so early warning is especially important for protecting
public health.

Several  NOAA  projects  have  investigated  the  use  of  instruments  moored  offshore
that  are  capable  of  taking  pictures,  recognizing  images  of  Karenia  and  sending  the
pictures  back  to  shore-based  labs  to  provide  early  warning.  During  a  recent  experi-
mental  deployment  a  HAB  organism  was  observed  in  very  high  numbers  that  had
never caused problems in the U.S. before, Dinophysis. State public health managers
were  immediately  notified  and  oysters  were  found  to  be  toxic.  Shellfish  harvesting
was  closed  and  shellfish  recalled  just  days  before  the  Fulton  Oysterfest,  a  major
event  in  the  region,  attended  by  thousands  of  people.  Early  detection  and  quick
warning prevented human illness which would have been a devastating blow to the
local shellfish industry.

The  entire  west  coast  of  the  U.S.  has  problems  with  two  HAB  groups,
Alexandrium  and  Pseudo-nitzschia.  The  Alexandrium  on  the  west  coast  is  a  dif-
ferent  species,  but  similar  in  many  ways  to  the  Alexandrium  in  the  Gulf  of  Maine.
Much less is known about the factors that cause the west coast blooms or their im-
pacts.  Pseudo-nitzschia  are  a  group  of  species,  some  of  whom  produce  a  potent
neurotoxin  and  others  do  not.  The  toxin  accumulates  in  both  shellfish  and  fish  and
has caused bird and marine mammal mortality events. Particularly hard hit are sea
lions,  in  which  the  neurotoxin  causes  seizures.  The  effected  sea  lions  are  often  per-
manently  impaired  if  they  survive.  In  pregnant  females,  the  seizures  have  caused
them to go into labor prematurely.

State  and  tribal  public  health  monitoring  is  focused  on  shellfish  and  Dungeness
crabs. Through a variety of programs, NOAA has been very active in developing and
evaluating  quick  tests  for  detecting  the  toxins  from  Alexandrium  and  Pseudo-
nitzschia.  These  are  being  incorporated  into  both  State  and  tribal  monitoring  in
order  to  better  protect  human  health.  Monitoring  partnerships  between  State  and
tribal  agencies  and  researchers  have  been  fostered  by  NOAA  projects  in  Wash-
ington,  Oregon,  and  several  locations  in  California  to  incorporate  these  new  moni-
toring  technologies  and  to  develop  new,  more  effective  strategies.  One  of  these,  the
Olympic  Region  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  Partnership,  is  now  funded  by  the  State  of
Washington.

NOAA  has  jointly  funded  with  NSF  a  large  regional  study  along  the  Washington
coast to determine the off-shore source of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia, which are occasion-
ally transported into shore and make shellfish, particularly razor clams, toxic. This
study is developing a predictive model and is the basis of a HAB Forecast that will
be released this summer on an experimental basis.

Some  of  the  Great  Lakes  have  experienced  a  resurgence  of  algal  blooms  in  the
last  few  years,  especially  Lake  Erie  and  parts  of  Lake  Huron.  These  blooms,  com-
prised  of  a  mixture  of  cyanobacteria  (blue-green  algae),  but  usually  dominated  by
Microcystis,  can  produce  hepatotoxins  and  neurotoxins  that  can  cause  animal  and
human  illness  and  death.  The  organisms  also  produce  compounds  which  make  the

22

water taste and smell foul and can impart a bad taste to fish. In addition, the high
biomass  levels  can  lead  to  bottom  water  oxygen  depletion  (hypoxia),  which  kills
other  organisms.  Several  NOAA  projects  have  led  to  development  of  capacity  for
measuring  most  of  the  common  cyanobacterial  toxins  and  then  determining  when
and  where  these  toxins  occur.  These  projects  have  shown  that  all  major  groups  of
cyanobacterial  toxins  occur  in  the  Great  Lakes  at  some  times  and  that  concentra-
tions  can  at  times  be  very  high.  NOAA  is  developing  a  Great  Lakes  HAB  forecast,
based  on  satellite  remote  sensing,  in  order  to  provide  early  warning  of  blooms  and
bloom tracking.

Cyanobacterial  hepatotoxins  are  structurally  very  different  from  any  of  the  other
HAB  toxins  and  little  is  known  about  their  ability  to  accumulate  up  the  food  chain
and  impact  higher  trophic  levels,  including  humans.  Several  NOAA  studies  are  in-
vestigating  accumulation  and  impacts  of  these  toxins  in  organisms  that  consume
cyanobacteria  and  could  transfer  the  toxins  through  food  chains  that  might  lead  to
humans. The link between the zebra and quagga mussel invasion, alterations in nu-
trient  cycling,  and  cyanobacterial  blooms  is  being  investigated  by  both  NOAA  and
EPA,  as  a  jointly  funded  project  under  the  interagency  ECOHAB  program,  to  ex-
plain why these blooms have recurred and, perhaps, lead to an effective prevention
strategy.

In  general  NOAA-funded  research  has  made  the  greatest  improvements  in  devel-
oping new methods of detecting HABs and HAB toxins: improving monitoring capa-
bilities; understanding the causes and impacts of blooms; and predicting some of the
most  devastating  blooms.  Progress  towards  prevention  and  control  of  HABs  and
their impacts is also moving forward as a result of this advanced understanding and
capability. Development of prevention strategies and control technologies requires a
comprehensive  understanding  of  HAB  causes,  adequate  technology  development,
and programs that foster the transition from research to operations. The President’s
FY 2009 Budget Request will allow NOAA to continue its efforts to advance the Na-
tion’s capabilities in HAB prevention, control, and mitigation.

Future Directions and Challenges

The  2004  HABHRCA  reauthorization  mandated  four  HAB  reports  be  produced,
which summarize the accomplishments of federal research and response efforts and
provide guidance on future directions for HAB research and response. These reports,
developed by the IWG–4H, include the National Assessment of Efforts to Predict and
Respond  to  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  in  U.S.  Waters  and  the  National  Scientific  Re-
search, Development, Demonstration, and Technology Transfer Plan on Reducing Im-
pacts  from  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  (RDDTT  Plan).  These  two  reports  will  be  com-
bined  and  published  under  the  name  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  Management  and  Re-
sponse:  Assessment  and  Plan.  The  other  two  reports  are  the  Scientific  Assessment
of  Marine  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  (Marine  HAB  Report),  and  the  Scientific  Assess-
ment  of  Freshwater  Harmful  Algal  Blooms.  The  National  Assessment  of  Efforts  to
Predict  and  Respond  to  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  in  U.S.  Waters  was  transmitted  to
Congress  in  September  2007;  all  of  the  remaining  reports  are  undergoing  review
and will be transmitted to Congress as soon as possible.

The RDDTT Plan lays out a comprehensive approach for improving HAB preven-
tion, mitigation, control, event response, and HAB research and response infrastruc-
ture. As a result, NOAA is establishing an RDDTT Program, which will be an extra-
mural,  competitive  research  program  to  support  the  development,  demonstration
and transfer of tools, technologies, and strategies to help resource managers, public
health  managers,  and  researchers  detect,  monitor,  investigate,  control,  and  reduce
HABs and their impacts. Both the original HABHRCA and the 2004 reauthorization
authorize  a  prevention,  control,  and  mitigation  program,  which  the  RDDTT  Plan
now  defines.  The  purpose  of  the  RDDTT  Program  will  be  to  transition  new  tech-
nology  and  information  into  tools  that  can  easily  be  used  by  managers  and  local
communities.

Recent  events  and  the  increasing  intensity  and  frequency  of  HAB  events  have
highlighted  the  need  for  enhancing  event  response  capabilities.  The  RDDTT  Plan
also gives a high priority to enhancing event response capabilities. NOAA is consid-
ering approaches to addressing this emerging issue.

The  Marine  HAB  Report  shows  that  most  HAB  problems  occur  regionally.  Con-
sequently,  most  research  is  conducted  and  accomplishments  are  achieved  on  a  re-
gional basis. In response to the conclusions outlined in the Marine HAB Report and
priorities within NOAA, we plan to increase the regional emphasis of our programs.
Research  in  each  region  would  be  guided  by  a  series  of  plans  developed  through
workshops attended by researchers, State and local resource and public health man-
agers,  and  other  interested  stake  holders.  These  workshops  would  assess  the  state
of  the  problem,  the  tools  that  are  currently  available  to  address  the  problem,  and

propose  priorities  for  future  research  and  actions  to  improve  management  and  re-
sponse in that region. NOAA has already sponsored workshops on specific HABs in
the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  southern  California,  and  Gulf  of  Maine  and  has  workshops  in
the planning stages for the entire West Coast Region and Hawaii.

One  of  the  long-term  goals  of  NOAA’s  research  is  the  development  of  operational
HAB  forecasts,  similar  in  many  ways  to  weather  forecasts.  The  purpose  is  to  give
advance warning that a HAB is or will be present and predict where it will go. De-
pending on the region, the early warning could be an annual prediction or a forecast
for  the  next  few  days.  State  public  health  and  resource  managers  unanimously  say
that the longer the warning lead time the more useful it is to them. These managers
primarily  use  warnings  to  guide  State  monitoring  programs  both  in  the  short-  and
long-term.

In  summary,  operational  forecasts  are  provided  in  Florida.  While  initially  these
forecasts  were  focused  on  the  southwest  coast,  they  are  now  available  for  the  Pan-
handle  and  the  east  coast  of  Florida  as  well.  NOAA  is  testing  forecast  models  in
Texas  and  the  Gulf  of  Maine,  and  plans  to  test  forecast  models  for  the  Washington
coast and in Lake Erie later this summer. In the next few years, the plan is to tran-
sition the forecast models we are testing into an operational mode. This will require
close collaboration with the developing U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System be-
cause HAB forecasts are dependent on real-time data about ocean conditions. In ad-
dition,  the  development  and  deployment  of  HAB  sensors  are  critical  for  providing
models with data about HAB incidence and abundance.

Conclusion

Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  update  you  on  NOAA’s  HAB  programs.  Over
the  last  ten  years  we  have  made  enormous  progress  in  understanding  the  causes
and consequences of HABs, which has led to the development of many tools and in-
formation products that improve HAB management, particularly in the area of miti-
gation. We anticipate that in the next ten years this progress will continue and our
ability to prevent and control as well as mitigate will be greatly enhanced.

BIOGRAPHY FOR ROBERT E. MAGNIEN

Robert Magnien has been Director of NOAA’s Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean
Research (CSCOR) since 2003. CSCOR is responsible for administering the competi-
tive research programs called for in the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research
and Control Act (HABHRCA) which include the only two national programs devoted
solely  to  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  (HAB)  research.  CSCOR  also  administers  the  na-
tional competitive Hypoxia research programs called for in HABHRCA and other re-
gional-scale  applied  research  programs  to  provide  the  predictive  capabilities  nec-
essary for management of coastal systems in an ecosystem context.

From 1983 to 2003 Dr. Magnien held several positions in the State of Maryland’s
Chesapeake  Bay  Program  from  its  inception  and  served  in  numerous  leadership
roles  (technical  and  policy)  for  the  EPA-led  regional  Chesapeake  Bay  Program.  He
last  served  from  1995  to  2003  for  Maryland’s  Department  of  Natural  Resources  as
Director  of  the  Tidewater  Ecosystem  Assessment  (TEA)  Division  and,  additionally,
from  2002  to  2003  as  Director  of  the  Resource  Assessment  Service,  which  oversees
the Maryland Geological Survey and three other Divisions which include most of the
State’s  science  capabilities  related  to  the  management  of  the  Chesapeake  Bay  and
freshwaters.  In  these  capacities  Dr.  Magnien  led  Maryland’s  efforts  to  respond  to

threats posed by HABs and reported to the Governor and his cabinet as needed. He
also  provided  leadership  on  numerous  other  State  and  regional  issues  involving
science  and  policy  including  monitoring  programs,  hypoxia,  water  quality,  habitat
restoration,  dredging  operations,  toxic  contaminants,  ecological  forecasting,  and  in-
formation management.

Dr.  Magnien  has  authored  numerous  peer-reviewed  publications,  technical  re-
ports, agency documents and workshop reports and has also made numerous invited
and  submitted  presentations  at  international,  national,  and  regional  scientific  con-
ferences.  These  publications  and  presentations  include  his  work  on  harmful  algal
blooms,  hypoxia,  large-scale  monitoring  programs,  environmental  assessments  and
the interactions between science and policy.

Dr.  Magnien  received  a  Ph.D.  in  Aquatic  Ecology  from  Dartmouth  College  and  a

B.S. in Biology from the State University of New York at Albany.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Dr. Magnien.
Dr. Anderson, you are recognized for five minutes.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  DONALD  M.  ANDERSON,  SENIOR  SCI-
ENTIST,  DEPARTMENT  OF  BIOLOGY,  WOODS  HOLE  OCEANO-
GRAPHIC  INSTITUTION;  DIRECTOR,  U.S.  NATIONAL  OFFICE
FOR MARINE BIOTOXINS AND HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS
Dr.  ANDERSON.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee,  my  name  is  Don  Anderson  and  I  am  a  senior  scientist
at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, where I have studied
red tides and HABs for over 30 years. I have also been actively in-
volved in the formulation of the programs and legislation that sup-
port  our  national  HAB  program.  And  to  reinforce  what  Rob
Magnien just said, I would like to go through some images here for
you.

HABs are caused by algae, many of them microscopic, as you see
here.  These  species  make  their  presence  known  through  massive
blooms  of  cells  that  discolor  the  water,  sometimes  through  the  ill-
ness and death of humans who have consumed contaminated shell-
fish or fish, through the mass mortalities of fish, sea birds and ma-
rine  mammals,  and  sometimes  through  irritating  or  aerosolized
toxins that drive tourists from beaches.

Seaweeds  can  also  cause  harm,  as  seen  as  in  these  images  from
China, where the sailing events in the Olympics are threatened by
massive blooms. These are some rather spectacular images, I think.
Marine  HABs  affect  every  coastal  state  in  the  United  States.
Now,  Florida,  Texas  and  other  states  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  are  af-
fected  by  HABs  that  make  shellfish  poisonous,  that  kill  fish  and
that  release  aerosolized  toxins.  The  causitive  organisms  can  be
found  in  the  water  year-round  over  wide  areas.  These  cells  pro-
liferate  in  certain  areas  and  at  certain  times,  often  offshore,  and

are  then  transported  to  shore  by  wind  events.  Special  features  of
the ocean bottom facilitate this transport and focus cell delivery to
sites  of  recurrent  blooms,  as  you  see  here.  Studies  are  ongoing  to
address the highly controversial issue of the potential link between
red  tides  and  nutrient  inputs  from  land  including  those  associated
with agriculture and other human activities.

Now,  in  contrast,  in  the  northeastern  United  States,  a  different
algal  species  produces  toxins  that  accumulate  in  shellfish  but  that
does  not  cause  massive  fish  kills  or  become  aerosolized.  These
blooms  show  no  obvious  link  to  land-derived  pollution.  The  orga-
nism  is  not  present  in  the  water  year-round.  Instead,  the  blooms
are  heavily  reliant  on  a  cyst  or  a  seed  stage  that  lies  dormant  in
the  sediments  for  most  of  the  year  and  then  germinates  to  inocu-
late the surface water, so the blooms are highly seasonal.

Here again, the transport pathways have been identified that are
critical  in  carrying  the  toxic  shells  to  both  near-shore  and  offshore
shellfish,  as  shown  in  this  image.  Industry  efforts  to  open  a  $50-
million-a-year sustainable offshore shellfish resource near George’s
bank  are  being  severely  constrained  by  the  offshore  component  of
these blooms. So in these and many other cases, research progress
has  been  significant  and  it  is  providing  tools  to  managers.  For  ex-
ample,  a  computer  model  of  HAB  dynamics  in  the  Gulf  of  Maine
has  advanced  to  the  level  where  we  were  able  to  forecast  this
spring  a  major  bloom  for  the  region  that  did  occur  several  months
later, an outbreak that closed shellfish beds from Canada to Massa-
chusetts. This is the first time a forecast of this type has ever been
attempted  anywhere.  This  model  is  now  being  used  to  provide
weekly  forecasts  to  managers  and  will  be  used  by  NOAA  as  the
basis  of  an  operational  HAB  forecasting  system  for  the  Gulf  of
Maine.

So research progress on HABs has been significant in the United
States, in part because the scientific and management communities
worked  together  15  years  ago  to  formulate  a  national  plan  or  re-
search  agenda.  The  1993  National  Plan  is  outdated,  however.  We
therefore  formulated  a  new  plan  called  HARRNESS,  a  framework
that will guide U.S. HAB research and monitoring well into the fu-
ture, and I enthusiastically support this program.

33

Now,  under  HARRNESS,  several  existing  national  research  pro-
grams  will  continue  but  new  programs  are  needed,  and  prominent
among  these  is  a  program  on  prevention,  control  and  mitigation  of
harmful  algal  blooms.  This  is  something  that  Rob  Magnien  de-
scribed  as  the  RDDTT  program.  I  also  endorse  this  program  and
recommend that funds be provided for it that are separate from ex-
isting fundamental research programs such as ECOHAB. There are
a  number  of  promising  HAB  mitigation  and  control  strategies
under  development  that  are  highlighted  in  my  written  testimony.
Perhaps we can explore these during questions.

So  in  conclusion,  the  diverse  nature  of  HAB  phenomena  and  the
hydrodynamic  and  geographic  variability  associated  with  different
outbreaks  throughout  the  United  States  pose  significant  chal-
lenges, no doubt. As a result of research funding through ECOHAB
and  other  programs,  however,  the  scientific  and  management  com-
munity  has  the  skills  and  the  knowledge  to  deal  with  these  issues

(HABs) for 30 years. I am here to provide the perspective of an experienced scientist
who has investigated many of the harmful algal bloom (HAB) phenomena that affect
coastal  waters  of  the  United  States  and  the  world.  I  am  also  Director  of  the  U.S.
National  Office  for  Marine  Biotoxins  and  Harmful  Algal  Blooms,  Co-Chair  of  the
National  HAB  Committee,  and  have  been  actively  involved  in  formulating  the  sci-
entific framework and agency partnerships that support and guide our national pro-
gram  on  HABs.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  acquaint  you  with  the  challenges
posed  to  the  U.S.  and  other  countries  by  HABs,  the  present  status  of  our  research
progress,  options  for  prevention,  control,  and  mitigation,  and  the  future  pro-
grammatic actions that are needed to maintain and expand this important national
program.  Other  than  a  few  general  comments,  I  will  restrict  my  comments  to  ma-
rine HABs, as testimony on freshwater HABs is being provided by my colleague Dr.
Kenneth Hudnell.

BACKGROUND

Among  the  thousands  of  species  of  microscopic  algae  at  the  base  of  the  marine
food  chain  are  a  few  dozen  which  produce  potent  toxins.  These  species  make  their
presence known in many ways, sometimes as a massive ‘‘bloom’’ of cells that discolor
the  water,  sometimes  as  dilute,  inconspicuous  concentrations  of  cells  noticed  only
because  they  produce  highly  potent  toxins  which  either  kill  marine  organisms  di-
rectly, or transfer through the food chain, causing harm at multiple levels. The im-
pacts  of  these  phenomena  include  mass  mortalities  of  wild  and  farmed  fish  and
shellfish, human intoxications or even death from contaminated shellfish or fish, al-
terations  of  marine  trophic  structure  through  adverse  effects  on  larvae  and  other
life  history  stages  of  commercial  fisheries  species,  and  death  of  marine  mammals,
seabirds, and other animals.

Blooms of toxic algae are commonly called ‘‘red tides,’’ since the tiny plants some-
times  increase  in  abundance  until  they  dominate  the  planktonic  community  and
sometimes  make  the  water  appear  discolored.  The  term  is  misleading,  however,
since  toxic  blooms  may  be  greenish  or  brownish,  non-toxic  species  can  bloom  and
harmlessly discolor the water, and, conversely, adverse effects can occur when some
algal  cell  concentrations  are  low  and  the  water  is  clear.  Given  the  confusion,  the
scientific community now uses the term ‘‘harmful algal bloom’’ or HAB.

HAB  phenomena  take  a  variety  of  forms  and  have  a  variety  of  impacts.  With  re-
gard  to  human  health,  the  major  category  of 
impact  occurs  when  toxic
phytoplankton  are  filtered  from  the  water  as  food  by  shellfish  which  then  accumu-
late  the  algal  toxins  to  levels  that  can  be  lethal  to  humans  or  other  consumers.
These poisoning syndromes have been given the names paralytic, diarrhetic, neuro-
toxic, azaspiracid, and amnesic shellfish poisoning (PSP, DSP, NSP, AZP, and ASP).
All  have  serious  effects,  and  some  can  be  fatal.  Except  for  ASP,  all  are  caused  by
biotoxins  synthesized  by  a  class  of  marine  algae  called  dinoflagellates.  ASP  is  pro-
duced  by  diatoms  that  until  recently  were  all  thought  to  be  free  of  toxins  and  gen-
erally harmless. A sixth human illness, Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is caused by
biotoxins  produced  by  dinoflagellates  that  grow  on  seaweeds  and  other  surfaces  in
coral  reef  communities.  Ciguatera  toxins  are  transferred  through  the  food  chain
from herbivorous reef fishes to larger carnivorous, commercially valuable finfish. Yet
another human health impact from HABs occurs when a class of algal toxins called
the  brevetoxins  becomes  airborne  in  sea  spray,  causing  respiratory  irritation  and
asthma-like symptoms in beach-goers and coastal residents, typically along the Flor-
ida and Texas shores of the Gulf of Mexico. Macroalgal or seaweed blooms also fall
under  the  HAB  umbrella.  Excessive  seaweed  growth,  often  linked  to  pollution  in-
puts, can displace natural underwater vegetation, cover coral reefs, and wash up on
beaches,  where  the  odor  of  masses  of  decaying  material  is  a  serious  deterrent  to
tourism.  Finally,  another  poorly  understood  human  illness  linked  to  toxic  algae  is
caused  by  the  dinoflagellate  Pfiesteria  piscicida  and  related  organisms  (e.g.,
Karlodinium)  that  have  been  linked  to  symptoms  such  as  deficiencies  in  learning
and  memory,  skin  lesions,  and  acute  respiratory  and  eye  irritation—all  after  expo-
sure  to  estuarine  waters  where  Pfiesteria-like  organisms  have  been  present
(Burkholder and Glasgow, 1997).

Distribution of HAB Phenomena in the United States

With  the  exception  of  AZP,  all  of  the  poisoning  syndromes  described  above  are
known  problems  within  the  U.S.  and  its  territories,  affecting  large  expanses  of
coastline  (Fig.  1).  PSP  occurs  in  all  coastal  New  England  states  as  well  as  New
York, extending to offshore areas in the northeast, and along much of the west coast
from  Alaska  to  northern  California.  Overall,  PSP  affects  more  U.S.  coastline  than
any  other  algal  bloom  problem.  NSP  occurs  annually  along  Gulf  of  Mexico  coasts,

with the most frequent outbreaks along western Florida and Texas. Louisiana, Mis-
sissippi,  North  Carolina  and  Alabama  have  also  been  affected  intermittently,  caus-
ing  extensive  losses  to  the  oyster  industry  and  killing  birds  and  marine  mammals.
ASP  has  been  a  problem  for  all  of  the  U.S.  Pacific  coast  states.  The  ASP  toxin  has
been  detected  in  shellfish  on  the  east  coast  as  well,  and  in  plankton  from  Gulf  of
Mexico  waters.  DSP  is  largely  unknown  in  the  U.S.,  but  a  major  outbreak  was  re-
cently  reported  along  the  Texas  coast,  resulting  in  an  extensive  closure  of  shellfish
beds  in  that  area.  Human  health  problems  from  Pfiesteria  and  related  species  are
thus far poorly documented, but some are thought to have affected laboratory work-
ers, fishermen, and others working in or exposed to estuarine waters in several por-
tions of the southeastern U.S. CFP is the most frequently reported non-bacterial ill-
ness  associated  with  eating  fish  in  the  U.S.  and  its  territories,  but  the  number  of
cases  is  probably  far  higher,  because  reporting  to  the  U.S.  Center  for  Disease  Con-
trol is voluntary and there is no confirmatory laboratory test. In the Virgin Islands,
it is estimated that nearly 50 percent of the adults have been poisoned at least once,
and some estimate that 20,000–40,000 individuals are poisoned by Ciguatera annu-
ally  in  Puerto  Rico  and  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands  alone.  CFP  occurs  in  virtually  all
sub-tropical  to  tropical  U.S.  waters  (i.e.,  Florida,  Texas,  Hawaii,  Guam,  Virgin  Is-
lands,  Puerto  Rico,  and  many  Pacific  Territories).  As  tropical  fish  are  increasingly
exported to distant markets, Ciguatera has become a worldwide problem.

Economic and Societal Impacts

HABs  have  a  wide  array  of  economic  impacts,  including  the  costs  of  conducting
routine  monitoring  programs  for  shellfish  and  other  affected  resources,  short-term
and permanent closure of harvestable shellfish and fish stocks, reductions in seafood
sales  (including  the  avoidance  of  ‘‘safe’’  seafoods  as  a  result  of  over-reaction  to
health advisories), mortalities of wild and farmed fish, shellfish, submerged aquatic
vegetation  and  coral  reefs,  impacts  on  tourism  and  tourism-related  businesses,  and
medical  treatment  of  exposed  populations.  A  conservative  estimate  of  the  average
annual economic impact resulting from HABs in the U.S. is approximately $82 mil-
lion  (Hoagland  and  Scatasta,  2006).  Cumulatively,  the  costs  of  HABs  exceed  a  bil-
lion dollars over the last several decades. These estimates do not include the appli-
cation of ‘‘multipliers’’ that are often used to account for the manner in which money
transfers  through  a  local  economy.  With  multipliers,  the  estimate  of  HAB  impacts
in  the  United  States  would  increase  several  fold.  Furthermore,  individual  bloom
events  can  approach  the  annual  average,  as  occurred  for  example  in  2005  when  a

massive bloom of Alexandrium species along the New England coast closed shellfish
beds from Maine to southern Massachusetts. The impact to the Massachusetts shell-
fish  industry  alone  was  estimated  by  the  State  Division  of  Marine  Fisheries  to  be
$50M, with similar large impacts occurring in Maine. Additional unquantified losses
were  experienced  by  the  tourist  industry  and  by  restaurants  and  seafood  retailers,
as  consumers  often  avoided  all  seafood  from  the  region,  despite  assurances  that  no
toxins had been detected in many of these seafood products.

Recent Trends

The  nature  of  the  HAB  problem  has  changed  considerably  over  the  last  several
decades  in  the  U.S.  Virtually  every  coastal  state  is  now  threatened  by  harmful  or
toxic algal species, whereas 30–40 years ago, the problem was much more scattered
and  sporadic  (Fig.  2.).  The  number  of  toxic  blooms,  the  economic  losses  from  them,
the  types  of  resources  affected,  and  the  number  of  toxins  and  toxic  species  have  all
increased dramatically in recent years in the U.S. and around the world (Anderson,
1989; Hallegraeff, 1993).

The first thought of many is that pollution or other human activities are the main
reason  for  this  expansion,  yet  in  the  U.S.  at  least,  many  of  the  ‘‘new’’  or  expanded
HAB  problems  have  occurred  in  waters  where  pollution  is  not  an  obvious  factor.
Some new bloom events likely reflect indigenous populations that have been discov-
ered  because  of  better  detection  methods  and  more  observers  rather  than  new  spe-
cies introductions or dispersal events (Anderson, 1989).

Other  ‘‘spreading  events’’  are  most  easily  attributed  to  dispersal  via  natural  cur-
rents,  while  it  is  also  clear  that  man  may  have  contributed  to  the  global  HAB  ex-
pansion  by  transporting  toxic  species  in  ship  ballast  water  (Hallegraeff  and  Bolch,
1992).  The  U.S.  Coast  Guard,  EPA,  and  the  International  Maritime  Organization
are all working toward ballast water control and treatment regulations that will at-
tempt to reduce the threat of species introductions worldwide.

Another  factor  underlying  the  global  expansion  of  HABs  is  the  dramatic  increase
in  aquaculture  activities.  This  leads  to  increased  monitoring  of  product  quality  and
safety,  revealing  indigenous  toxic  algae  that  were  probably  always  present  (Ander-
son, 1989). The construction of aquaculture facilities also places fish or shellfish re-
sources in areas where toxic algal species occur but were previously unknown, lead-
ing  to  mortality  events  or  toxicity  outbreaks  that  would  not  have  been  noticed  had
the aquaculture facility not been placed there.

Of  considerable  concern,  particularly  for  coastal  resource  managers,  is  the  poten-
tial  relationship  between  the  apparent  increase  in  HABs  and  the  accelerated  eu-

trophication  of  coastal  waters  due  to  human  activities  (Anderson  et  al.,  2002).  As
mentioned  above,  some  HAB  outbreaks  occur  in  pristine  waters  with  no  influence
from  pollution  or  other  anthropogenic  effects,  but  linkages  between  HABs  and  eu-
trophication  have  been  frequently  noted  within  the  past  several  decades  (e.g.,
Smayda,  1990).  Coastal  waters  are  receiving  massive  and  increasing  quantities  of
industrial,  agricultural  and  sewage  effluents  through  a  variety  of  pathways.  In
many  urbanized  coastal  regions,  these  anthropogenic  inputs  have  altered  the  size
and  composition  of  the  nutrient  pool  which  may,  in  turn,  create  a  more  favorable
nutrient  environment  for  certain  HAB  species.  Just  as  the  application  of  fertilizer
to  lawns  can  enhance  grass  growth,  marine  algae  can  grow  in  response  to  various
types  of  nutrient  inputs.  Shallow  and  restricted  coastal  waters  that  are  poorly
flushed  appear  to  be  most  susceptible  to  nutrient-related  algal  problems.  Nutrient
enrichment of such systems often leads to eutrophication and increased frequencies
and  magnitudes  of  phytoplankton  blooms,  including  HABs.  There  is  no  doubt  that
this is true in certain areas of the world where pollution has increased dramatically.
A  prominent  example  is  the  area  of  the  East  China  Sea  near  Qingdao—where  sail-
ing activities in the forthcoming Olympics are threatened by mass quantities of sea-
weed  that  are  a  direct  result  of  unchecked  coastal  pollution.  This  problem  is  real,
but  less  evident  in  areas  where  coastal  pollution  is  more  gradual  and  unobtrusive.
It  is  now  clear  that  the  worldwide  expansion  of  HAB  phenomena  is  in  part  a  re-
flection  of  our  ability  to  better  define  the  boundaries  of  an  existing  problem.  Those
boundaries are also expanding, however, due to natural species dispersal via storms
or currents, as well as to human-assisted species dispersal, and enhanced HAB pop-
ulation  growth  as  a  result  of  pollution  or  other  anthropogenic  influences.  The  fact
that part of the expansion is a result of increased awareness should not temper our
concern.  The  HAB  problem  in  the  U.S.  is  serious,  large,  and  growing.  It  is  a  much
larger problem than we thought it was several decades ago.

PROGRESS AND STATUS OF OUR NATIONAL PROGRAM ON HABS

More than a decade ago, the U.S. approach to research on marine HABS was un-
coordinated  and  modest  in  scale.  Research  groups  were  few  and  their  work  was
piecemeal  and  constrained  by  small  budgets  that  fluctuated  with  the  sporadic
blooms  that  would  occur.  There  were  virtually  no  U.S.  Government  laboratories  in-
volved  in  HAB  research.  Funding  for  academic  scientists  was  largely  available
through  competitions  within  the  entire  oceanographic  community  since  there  were
no  targeted  funding  programs  for  HABs.  This  situation  changed  dramatically  with
the  formulation  of  a  national  plan  (Marine  Biotoxins  and  Harmful  Algal  Blooms;  A
National Plan; Anderson et al., 1993). This plan, the result of a workshop involving
academic and federal scientists, as well as agency officials, and industry representa-
tives,  identified  major  impediments  to  the  goal  of  science-based  management  of  re-
sources  affected  by  HABs,  and  made  recommendations  on  the  steps  needed  to  re-
move  those  impediments.  These  impediments  have  been  addressed  to  varying  de-
grees  with  funding  programs  targeting  specific  topic  areas  within  the  broad  field  of
HABs  and  their  impacts.  It  is  my  belief  that  the  National  Plan  has  been  a  major
success,  leading  to  the  creation  of  several  multi-agency  partnerships  for  HAB  stud-
ies,  and  to  many  individual  agency  initiatives  on  this  topic.  Two  national,  extra-
mural  HAB  funding  programs,  Ecology  of  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  (ECOHAB)  and
Monitoring  and  Event  Response  for  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  (MERHAB),  have  to-
gether  funded  approximately  $100  million  in  marine  HAB  research  since  the  pro-
grams  began  in  1996  and  2000,  respectively.  Another  partnership  between  the  Na-
tional  Institute  of  Environmental  Health  Sciences  (NIEHS)  and  the  National
Science  Foundation  (NSF)  has  supported  four  Centers  for  Oceans  and  Human
Health  that  include  significant  HAB  research  and  outreach  activities.  NOAA  has
also  created  an  Oceans  and  Human  Health  Initiative  (OHHI)  that  supports  extra-
mural research and focused activities at three federal OHHI centers. These are just
a  few  of  many  programs  and  activities  that  were  motivated  by  the  1993  National
Plan.

Research and Management Progress

With  the  advent  of  ECOHAB,  MERHAB,  the  OHH  programs,  and  other  national
HAB programs, resources have been directed towards the goal of scientifically based
management of coastal waters and fisheries that are potentially impacted by HABs.
These  activities  have  already  made  a  significant  contribution  to  HAB  management
capabilities in the U.S. Here I will highlight several advances in our understanding
of  HAB  phenomena,  as  well  as  some  of  the  program-derived  technological  develop-
ments  that  are  providing  new  tools  to  coastal  resource  managers  in  regions  im-
pacted by HABs.

Enhanced understanding of HAB dynamics

39

In  areas  studied  by  the  multi-investigator  ECOHAB-funded  regional  research
projects,  HAB  phenomena  are  now  far  better  understood  than  was  the  case  just  10
years ago when the program began. Knowledge is also increasing for HABs in other
areas  through  smaller,  targeted  research  projects.  In  the  Gulf  of  Maine,  the  focus
of  the  ECOHAB–GOM  and  GOMTOX  regional  programs,  survey  cruises,  experi-
mental  and  process  studies,  and  numerical  models  have  led  to  the  development  of
a  conceptual  model  of  bloom  dynamics  that  is  consistent  with  observations  of
Alexandrium cell distributions, and with patterns of toxicity in shellfish along much
of  the  New  England  coast  (Anderson  et  al.,  2005).  A  key  feature  of  this  model  is
the  strong  influence  of  dormant  resting  cysts  in  bottom  sediments  on  bloom  mag-
nitude.  Cysts  in  several  large  accumulation  zones  or  ‘‘seedbeds’’  germinate  in  the
spring  and  re-populate  the  water  column  with  swimming  Alexandrium  cells,  which
then  multiply  and  cause  the  annual  PSP  outbreaks.  Major  bloom  transport  path-
ways  in  the  Maine  Coastal  Current  system  have  also  been  identified,  with  delivery
of  the  toxic  algal  cells  to  shore  influenced  by  the  patterns  and  strength  of  onshore-
and offshore-oriented wind events.

In the Gulf of Mexico, the ECOHAB–Florida program identified transport and de-
livery mechanisms for the toxic Karenia cells that kill fish, cause shellfish to become
toxic, and release an irritating aerosol that drives residents and tourists from beach-
es.  In  particular,  the  Karenia  cells  are  now  thought  to  be  transported  onshore  in
deeper waters through wind events that cause ‘‘upwelling.’’ Special bathymetric fea-
tures  of  the  ocean  bottom  can  facilitate  this  transport  and  focus  cell  delivery  to
areas  known  to  be  the  sites  of  recurrent  blooms.  Studies  of  nutrient  uptake  by
Karenia and surveys of nutrient concentrations in the region are addressing the sen-
sitive  and  highly  controversial  issue  of  the  potential  link  between  red  tide  blooms
and nutrient inputs from land, including those associated with agriculture and other
human activities. This ongoing research has obvious implications to policy decisions
concerning pollution and water quality in the region.

Consistent  with  the  identification  of  ‘‘source  regions’’  for  Gulf  of  Maine  and  Gulf
of  Mexico  HABs,  researchers  in  the  Pacific  Northwest  have  identified  an  area  west
of  Puget  Sound  that  appears  to  accumulate  toxic  diatoms  responsible  for  outbreaks
of  amnesic  shellfish  poisoning  (ASP),  a  debilitating  illness  that  includes  permanent
loss  of  short-term  memory  in  some  victims.  Other  programs  have  been  equally  pro-
ductive  in  identifying  underlying  driving  mechanisms  for  HAB  blooms,  such  as  the
brown tide blooms in New York and New Jersey. These dense accumulations of tiny
Aureococcus  anophagefferens  cells  turn  the  water  a  deep  brown,  blocking  sunlight
to  submerged  vegetation,  and  altering  the  feeding  behavior  of  shellfish.  These
blooms have been linked to certain types of nutrients that seem to favor the causa-
tive  organism—in  particular  ‘‘organic’’  forms  of  nitrogen  that  are  preferred  by  the
brown tide cells, and give it a competitive advantage in certain locations.

Improved monitoring and detection of HAB cells and toxins

These  are  but  a  few  of  the  advances  in  understanding  that  have  accrued  from
ECOHAB regional funding. Equally important are the discoveries that provide man-
agement tools to reduce the impacts of HABs on coastal resources. Management op-
tions for dealing with the impacts of HABs include reducing their incidence and ex-
tent  (prevention),  stopping  or  containing  blooms  (control),  and  minimizing  impacts
(mitigation).  Where  possible,  it  is  preferable  to  prevent  HABs  rather  than  to  treat
their  symptoms.  Since  increased  pollution  and  nutrient  loading  may  enhance  the
growth  of  some  HAB  species,  these  events  may  be  prevented  by  reducing  pollution
inputs to coastal waters, particularly industrial, agricultural, and domestic effluents
high in plant nutrients. This is especially important in shallow, poorly flushed coast-
al waters that are most susceptible to nutrient-related algal problems. As mentioned
above,  research  on  the  links  between  certain  HABs  and  nutrients  has  highlighted
the  importance  of  non-point  sources  of  nutrients  (e.g.,  from  agricultural  activities,
fossil-fuel combustion, and animal feeding operations).

The  most  effective  HAB  management  tools  are  monitoring  programs  that  involve
sampling  and  testing  of  wild  or  cultured  seafood  products  directly  from  the  natural
environment, as this allows unequivocal tracking of toxins to their site of origin and
targeted  regulatory  action.  Numerous  monitoring  programs  of  this  type  have  been
established  in  U.S.  coastal  waters,  typically  by  State  agencies.  This  monitoring  has
become  quite  expensive,  however,  due  to  the  proliferation  of  toxins  and  potentially
affected  resources.  States  are  faced  with  flat  or  declining  budgets  and  yet  need  to
monitor for a growing list of HAB toxins and potentially affected fisheries resources.
Technologies  are  thus  urgently  needed  to  facilitate  the  detection  and  characteriza-
tion of HAB cells and blooms.

One very useful technology that has been developed through recent HAB research
relies  on  species-  or  strain-specific  ‘‘probes’’  that  can  be  used  to  label  only  the  HAB
cells  of  interest  so  they  can  then  be  detected  visually,  electronically,  or  chemically.
Progress  has  been  rapid  and  probes  of  several  different  types  are  now  available  for
many of the harmful algae, along with techniques for their application in the rapid
and accurate identification, enumeration, and isolation of individual species. One ex-
ample  of  the  direct  application  of  this  technology  in  operational  HAB  monitoring  is
for 
tide  organism,  Aureococcus
anophagefferens. The causative organism is so small and non-descript that it is vir-
tually  impossible  to  identify  and  count  cells  using  traditional  microscopic  tech-
niques.  Antibody  probes  were  developed  that  bind  only  to  A.  anophagefferens  cells,
and  these  are  now  used  routinely  in  monitoring  programs  run  by  State  and  local
authorities, greatly improving counting time and accuracy.

the  New  York  and  New  Jersey  brown 

These  probes  are  being  incorporated  into  a  variety  of  different  assay  systems,  in-
cluding  some  that  can  be  mounted  on  buoys  and  left  unattended  while  they
robotically  sample  the  water  and  test  for  HAB  cells.  Clustered  with  other  instru-
ments  that  measure  the  physical,  chemical,  and  optical  characteristics  of  the  water
column,  information  can  be  collected  and  used  to  make  ‘‘algal  forecasts’’  of  impend-
ing  toxicity.  These  instruments  are  taking  advantage  of  advances  in  ocean  optics,
as well as the new molecular and analytical methodologies that allow the toxic cells
or  chemicals  (such  as  HAB  toxins)  to  be  detected  with  great  sensitivity  and  speci-
ficity.  A  clear  need  has  been  identified  for  improved  instrumentation  for  HAB  cell
and  toxin  detection,  and  additional  resources  are  needed  in  this  regard.  This  can
be  accomplished  during  development  of  the  Integrated  Ocean  Observing  System
(IOOS)  for  U.S.  coastal  waters,  and  through  a  targeted  research  program  on  HAB
prevention,  control,  and  mitigation  (see  below).  These  are  needed  if  we  are  to
achieve  our  vision  of  future  HAB  monitoring  and  management  programs—an  inte-
grated  system  that  includes  arrays  of  moored  instruments  as  sentinels  along  the
U.S.  coastline,  detecting  HABs  as  they  develop  and  radioing  the  information  to  re-
source  managers.  Just  as  in  weather  forecasting,  this  information  can  be  assimi-
lated into numerical models to improve forecast accuracy

Prediction and forecasting of HABs

A long-term goal of HAB monitoring programs is to develop the ability to forecast
or predict bloom development and movement. Prediction of HAB outbreaks requires
physical/biological  numerical  models  which  account  for  both  the  growth  and  behav-
ior  of  the  toxic  algal  species,  as  well  as  the  movement  and  dynamics  of  the  sur-
rounding  water.  Numerical  models  of  coastal  circulation  are  advancing  rapidly  in
the U.S., and a number of these are beginning to incorporate HAB dynamics as well.
A  model  developed  to  simulate  the  dynamics  of  the  organism  responsible  for  para-
lytic  shellfish  poisoning  (PSP)  outbreaks  in  the  Gulf  of  Maine  is  relatively  far  ad-
vanced in this regard (McGillicuddy et al., 2005), and is now being transitioned from
academic  use  towards  an  operational  mode.  Earlier  this  year,  my  colleagues  and  I
were able to successfully predict a major regional PSP outbreak in the Gulf of Maine
on  the  basis  of  our  cyst  mapping  and  modeling  activities  (www.whoi.edu/
page.do?pid=24039&tid=282&cid=41211).  This  is  the  first  time  a  major  HAB  event
has been predicted several months in advance, and is strong testimony to the bene-
fits of the ECOHAB program’s regional research emphasis. Our numerical model for
Alexandrium  bloom  dynamics  is  now  being  used  to  provide  weekly  nowcasts/fore-
casts  to  managers  and  other  stakeholders  affected  by  PSP  outbreaks  in  the  region,
and  is  slated  to  be  used  by  NOAA’s  National  Ocean  Service  (NOS)  as  the  basis  of
an operational HAB forecasting system for the Gulf of Maine.

In  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  satellite  images  of  ocean  color  are  now  used  to  detect  and
track  toxic  red  tides  of  Karenia  brevis.  Based  on  research  results  from  the
ECOHAB–Florida  program,  bloom  forecast  bulletins  are  now  being  provided  to  af-
fected states in the Gulf of Mexico by the NOAA NOS Center for Coastal Monitoring
and  Assessment.  The  bulletins  (see  http://www.csc.noaa.gov/crs/habf/)  are  based
on  the  integration  of  several  data  sources:  satellite  ocean  color  imagery;  wind  data
from  coastal  meteorological  stations;  field  observations  of  bloom  location  and  inten-
sity  provided  by  the  States  of  Florida  and  Texas;  and  weather  forecasts  from  the
National Weather Service. The combination of warning and rapid detection is a sig-
nificant aid to the Gulf states in responding to these blooms.

Mitigation and control strategies

Other  practical  strategies  to  mitigate  the  impacts  of  HAB  events  include:  regu-
lating  the  siting  of  aquaculture  facilities  to  avoid  areas  where  HAB  species  are
present,  modifying  water  circulation  for  those  locations  where  restricted  water  ex-

change  is  a  factor  in  bloom  development,  and  restricting  species  introductions  (e.g.,
through regulations on ballast water discharges or shellfish and finfish transfers for
aquaculture).  Each  of  these  strategies  requires  fundamental  research  such  as  that
being conducted in our national HAB program. Potential approaches to directly con-
trol  or  suppress  HABs  are  under  development  as  well—similar  to  methods  used  to
control pests on land—e.g., biological, physical, or chemical treatments that directly
target the bloom cells. One example is work conducted in my own laboratory, again
through ECOHAB support, using ordinary clay to control HABs. When certain clays
are dispersed on the water surface, the tiny clay particles aggregate with each other
and  with  other  particles,  including  HAB  cells.  The  aggregates  then  settle  to  the
ocean bottom, carrying the unwanted HAB cells from the surface waters where they
would  otherwise  grow  and  cause  harm.  As  with  many  other  new  technologies  for
HABs,  initial  results  are  quite  promising  and  small-scale  field  trials  are  underway,
but continued support is needed to fully evaluate benefits, costs, and environmental
impacts.

Another  intriguing  bloom  control  strategy  is  being  evaluated  for  the  brown  tide
problem. It has been suggested that one reason the brown tides appeared about 15–
20  years  ago  was  that  hard  clams  and  other  shellfish  stocks  have  been  depleted  by
overfishing  in  certain  areas.  Removal  of  these  resources  altered  the  manner  in
which those waters were ‘‘grazed’’—i.e., shellfish filter large quantities of water dur-
ing  feeding,  and  that  removes  many  microscopic  organisms  from  the  water,  includ-
ing  natural  predators  of  the  brown  tide  cells.  If  this  hypothesis  is  valid,  a  logical
bloom control strategy would be to re-seed shellfish in the affected areas, and to re-
strict  harvesting.  Pilot  projects  are  now  underway  to  explore  this  control  strategy
in Long Island.

In general, bloom control is an area where very little research effort has been di-
rected  in  the  U.S.  (Anderson,  1997),  and  considerable  research  is  needed  before
these  means  are  used  to  control  HABs  in  natural  waters  given  the  high  sensitivity
for  possible  damage  to  coastal  ecosystem  and  water  quality  by  the  treatments.  As
discussed  below,  this  could  be  accomplished  as  part  of  a  separate  national  program
on HAB prevention, control, and mitigation.

PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS

The 1993 National Plan is outdated. Some of its recommendations have been ful-
filled,  while  others  remain  partially  or  completely  unaddressed.  Concurrently,  the
nature and extent of the U.S. HAB problem changed with the emergence of several
new poisoning syndromes, the expansion of known problems into new areas, and the
identification of a variety of new HAB impacts and affected resources. Furthermore,
while  new  scientific  understanding  taught  us  that  HABs  and  the  toxins  they
produce are complex in their mode of action and that the ecosystems in which they
proliferate  are  equally  complex,  decision-making  and  management  systems  did  not
change to reflect that complexity. Likewise, many new tools to detect HAB cells and
their toxins have been developed, but are not fully tested or incorporated into exist-
ing  research,  management,  and  ocean  observation  programs.  These  and  other  con-
siderations led to the decision to revise and update the National Plan. Several hun-
dred scientists and managers, from a wide array of fields, contributed to the knowl-
edge  base  on  which  this  new  national  science  and  management  strategy  is  based.
Over  a  two-year  period,  an  intensive  collaborative  effort  was  undertaken,  including
an open forum discussion among 200 participants at the U.S. National HAB Sympo-
sium,  a  detailed  web-based  questionnaire  yielding  more  that  1,000  targeted  re-
sponses, a workshop of 50 U.S. HAB experts, an Advisory Committee to guide, and
a  Steering  Committee  to  assemble  and  review  the  most  current  information  avail-
able for use in developing the new plan.

Our  new  national  plan  is  called  HARRNESS  (Harmful  Algal  Research  and  Re-
sponse:  A  National  Environmental  Science  Strategy  2005–2015;  Ramsdell  et  al.,
2005). This is the framework that will guide U.S. HAB research and monitoring well
into the future, and is one that I enthusiastically support.

At  the  conceptual  level,  HARRNESS  is  a  framework  of  initiatives  and  programs
that  identify  and  address  current  and  evolving  needs  associated  with  HABs  and
their impacts. Four major areas of research focus have been defined in HARRNESS:
Bloom  Ecology  and  Dynamics,  Toxins  and  Their  Effects,  Food  Webs  and  Fisheries,
and Public Health and Socioeconomic Impacts. Each shares a need for a set of man-
agement  and  research  activities  directed  at  various  scales  of  the  HAB  problem.
These  include  highly  focused  or  targeted  research  studies,  regional  and  inter-re-
gional  scale  investigations,  and  policy-making  and  resource  management  activities
towards mitigation and control. Progress will be facilitated through the development
of activities and services (Infrastructure) required by multiple program foci.

At the programmatic level, several of the existing national programs will continue
to  function,  and  new  programs  will  need  to  be  added.  In  the  former  category,
ECOHAB  will  continue  to  address  the  fundamental  processes  underlying  the  im-
pacts  and  population  dynamics  of  HABs.  This  involves  a  recognition  of  the  many
factors at the organismal level that determine how HAB species respond to, and po-
tentially  alter  their  environment,  the  manner  in  which  HAB  species  affect  or  are
affected  by  food-web  interactions,  and  how  the  distribution,  abundance,  and  impact
of  HAB  species  are  regulated  by  the  environment.  ECOHAB  was  established  as  a
competitive,  peer-reviewed  research  program  supported  by  an  interagency  partner-
ship  involving  NOAA,  NSF,  EPA,  ONR,  and  NASA.  Research  results  have  been
brought  into  practical  applications  through  MERHAB,  a  program  formulated  to
transfer technologies and foster innovative monitoring programs and rapid response
by  public  agencies  and  health  departments.  MERHAB  will  also  continue  under  the
new HARRNESS framework.

Two relatively new programs (the Centers for Oceans and Human Health (COHH)
initiative  of  NIEHS  and  NSF  and  NOAA’s  OHHI)  are  being  enthusiastically  re-
ceived  by  the  scientific,  management  and  public  health  communities,  and  thus  are
expected  to  continue  under  HARRNESS.  They  fill  an  important  niche  by  creating
linkages  between  members  of  the  ocean  sciences  and  biomedical  communities  to
help  both  groups  address  the  public  health  aspects  of  HABs.  The  COHH  focus  on
HABs,  infectious  diseases,  and  marine  natural  products,  whereas  the  NOAA  OHHI
Centers  and  extramural  funding  include  these  subjects  in  addition  to  chemical  pol-
lutants,  coastal  water  quality  and  beach  safety,  seafood  quality,  sentinel  species  as
indicators  of  both  potential  human  health  risks  and  human  impact  on  marine  sys-
tems.  The  partnership  between  NIEHS,  NSF,  and  NOAA  clearly  needs  to  be  sus-
tained  and  expanded  in  order  to  provide  support  to  a  network  of  sufficient  size  to
address  the  significant  problems  under  the  OHH  umbrella.  This  is  best  accom-
plished  through  additional  funds  to  these  agencies,  as  well  as  through  the  involve-
ment  of  other  agencies  with  interests  in  oceans  and  human  health,  including,  for
example, EPA, NASA, FDA, and CDC.

A  number  of  the  recommendations  of  HARRNESS  are  not  adequately  addressed
by existing programs, however. As a result, the HAB community needs to work with
Congressional  staff  and  agency  program  managers  to  create  new  programs,  as  well
as  to  modify  existing  ones,  where  appropriate.  For  example,  a  separate  program  on
HABs  and  food  web  impacts  could  focus  resources  on  this  important  topic  area  in
a  way  that  is  not  presently  possible  through  ECOHAB.  Chemistry  and  toxicology
of  HABs,  the  underlying  basis  to  the  adverse  consequences  of  HABs,  receives  only
piecemeal funding through support of other HAB efforts and requires focused atten-
tion and a targeted funding initiative. Likewise the practical aspects of HAB preven-
tion,  control  and  mitigation  are  also  presently,  but  inadequately  included  in
ECOHAB. This program is discussed in more detail below.

With  the  exception  of  the  Great  Lakes,  which  fall  under  NOAA’s  jurisdiction,
freshwater  systems  that  are  impacted  by  HABs  have  not  been  comprehensively  ad-
dressed  in  ECOHAB,  MERHAB,  or  the  OHH  HAB  programs.  This  is  because
NOAA’s mandate includes the great Lakes and estuaries up to the freshwater inter-
face, but does not include the many rivers, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs that are sub-
ject  to  freshwater  HAB  problems.  Freshwater  HABs  are  an  important  focus  within
HARRNESS,  and  therefore  targeted  (and  separate)  legislation  and  funding  initia-
tives on freshwater HABs are needed.

The  support  provided  to  HAB  research  through  ECOHAB,  MERHAB,  Sea  Grant,
and  other  national  programs  has  had  a  tremendous  impact  on  our  understanding
of  HAB  phenomena,  and  on  the  development  of  management  tools  and  strategies.
Funding  for  ECOHAB  is  modest,  but  it  is  administered  in  a  scientifically  rigorous
manner  that  maximizes  research  progress.  Several  five-year  ECOHAB  regional  re-
search projects have ended, and new ones are beginning. HAB phenomena are com-
plex oceanographic phenomena, and a decade or more of targeted research are need-
ed  for  each  of  the  major  poisoning  syndromes  or  regions.  ECOHAB  support  for  re-
gional studies must be sustained and expanded, and this will require a commitment
of  resources  well  in  excess  of  those  currently  available.  Underlying  this  rec-
ommendation  is  the  recognition  that  we  need  to  form  multiple  skilled  research
teams  with  the  equipment  and  facilities  required  to  attack  the  complex  scientific
issues involved in HAB phenomena. Since HAB problems facing the U.S. are diverse
with respect to the causative species, the affected resources, the toxins involved, and
the  oceanographic  systems  and  habitats  in  which  the  blooms  occur,  we  need  mul-
tiple teams of skilled researchers and managers distributed throughout the country.
This argues against funding that ebbs and floods with the sporadic pattern of HAB
outbreaks or that focuses resources in one region while others go begging. I cannot
emphasize  too  strongly  the  need  for  an  equitable  distribution  of  resources

43

that  is  consistent  with  the  scale  and  extent  of  the  national  problem,  and
that is sustained through time. This  is  the  only  way  to  keep  research  teams  in-
tact,  forming  the  core  of  expertise  and  knowledge  that  leads  to  scientific  progress.
To  achieve  this  balance,  we  need  a  scientifically  based  allocation  of  resources,  not
one based on political jurisdictions. This is possible if we work within the guidelines
of HARRNESS and with the inter-agency effort that has been guiding its implemen-
tation.

A National Program on Prevention, Control, and Mitigation of HABs

Congress  mandated  a  program  for  HAB  Prevention,  Control  and  Management  in
the  legislation  reauthorizing  the  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  and  Hypoxia  Research  and
Control Act of 1998 (HABHRCA). The strong Congressional support behind this pro-
gram element is further seen in a section of HABHRCA that directs NOAA to ‘‘iden-
tify  innovative  response  measures  for  the  prevention,  control,  and  mitigation  of
harmful  algal  blooms  and  identify  steps  needed  for  their  development  and  imple-
mentation.’’  Further  rationale  for  this  program  is  that  much  of  the  focus  of  past
HAB  research  has  been  on  fundamental  aspects  of  organism  physiology,  ecology,
and  toxicology,  so  less  effort  has  been  directed  towards  practical  issues  such  as  re-
source  management  strategies,  or  even  direct  bloom  suppression  or  control  (Ander-
son, 1997). To meet this Congressional directive, a workshop was held, and a science
agenda  prepared  for  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  Research,  Development,  Demonstration,
and  Technology  Transfer  (RDDTT).  The  Executive  Summary  of  this  report  is  ap-
pended here as Annex 1. Another common name for this program is MACHAB (Miti-
gation and Control of Harmful Algal Blooms).

The  proposed  RDDTT  program  has  three  essential  components.  These  are  1)  an
extramural  funding  program  focused  on  development,  demonstration,  and  tech-
nology  transfer  of  methods  for  prevention,  control,  and  mitigation  (PCM)  of
HABs; 2) a comprehensive national HAB Event Response program: and 3) a Core
Infrastructure program. These components are interdependent and critical for im-
proving future HAB response

The  PCM  component  of  the  RDDTT  Program  focuses  on  moving  promising  tech-
nologies  and  strategies  arising  from  HAB  research  from  development  through  dem-
onstration  to  technology  transfer  and  field  application  by  end-users.  The  Event  Re-
sponse  component  improves  access  to  existing  resources  through  better  information
sharing, communication, and coordination and provides essential new resources. Re-
searching and implementing new PCM strategies and improving event response will
not be possible without enhancing infrastructure, including 1) increasing availability
of  adequate  analytical  facilities,  reference  and  research  materials,  toxin  standards,
culture collections, tissue banks, technical training, and access to data; 2) improving
integration  of  HAB  activities  with  existing  monitoring  and  emerging  observational
programs; and 3) enhancing communication and regional and national coordination.
The need and community readiness for the three RDDTT program elements varies
with the status of existing research and the planning required for each activity. The
RDDTT  program  can,  therefore,  be  implemented  in  stages,  with  projected  funding
needs increasing as the components mature. Implementation requires both changes
in authorizing legislation and increases in appropriations. Although RDDTT will be
the  program  that  the  public  will  most  readily  perceive  as  ’progress’  in  the  manage-
ment of HABs, the program is part of an integrated approach to HAB risk manage-
ment  that  includes  other  research  and  response  programs.  Thus,  it  is  essential
that  the  RDDTT  program  be  established  as  a  separate  element  within  the
national  HAB  program  (HARRNESS),  with  the  expectation  that  related
HAB  research  and  response  programs  will  provide  the  new  technologies
and  approaches  as  well  as  the  ecological  and  oceanographic  context  to
guide  its  practical  and  applied  activities.  Since  many  agencies  are  involved  in
HAB research and response, it will be necessary to specify that the RDDTT Program
is  an  interagency  program  and  to  provide  funding  to  agencies  with  major  roles.  In
addition  to  NOAA  and  NSF,  other  agencies,  such  as  FDA,  CDC,  NSF,  NIEHS,  and
USGS also contribute substantially and should be named as partners in the national
HAB program.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The  diverse  nature  of  HAB  phenomena  and  the  hydrodynamic  and  geographic
variability  associated  with  different  outbreaks  throughout  the  U.S.  pose  a  signifi-
cant  constraint  to  the  development  of  a  coordinated  national  HAB  program.  Never-
theless,  the  combination  of  planning,  coordination,  and  a  highly  compelling  topic
with great societal importance has initiated close cooperation between officials, gov-
ernment  scientists  and  academics  in  a  sustained  attack  on  the  HAB  problem.  The

44

rate  and  extent  of  progress  from  here  will  depend  upon  how  well  the  different  fed-
eral agencies continue to work together, and on how effectively the skills and exper-
tise  of  government  and  academic  scientists  can  be  targeted  on  priority  topics  that
have  not  been  well  represented  in  the  national  HAB  program.  The  opportunity  for
cooperation is clear, since as stated in the ECOHAB science plan (Anderson, 1995),
‘‘Nowhere  else  do  the  missions  and  goals  of  so  many  government  agencies  intersect
and interact as in the coastal zone where HAB phenomena are prominent.’’ The HAB
community in the U.S. has matured scientifically and politically, and is fully capable
of  undertaking  the  new  challenges  inherent  in  an  expanded  national  program,  ex-
emplified  in  HARRNESS.  This  will  be  successful  only  if  a  coordinated  interagency
effort  can  be  implemented  to  focus  research  personnel,  facilities,  and  financial  re-
sources to the common goals of a comprehensive national strategy.

In summary:

• Marine  HABs  are  a  serious  and  growing  problem  in  the  U.S.,  affecting  every
coastal  state;  freshwater  HABS  are  an  equally  significant  problem  in  inland
states. HABs impact public health, fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, and coast-
al  aesthetics.  HAB  problems  will  not  go  away  and  will  likely  increase  in  se-
verity.

• HABs are just one of many problems in the coastal zone that are affected by
nutrient inputs and over-enrichment from land. They represent a highly visi-
ble  indicator  of  the  health  of  our  coastal  ocean.  More  subtle  impacts  to  fish-
eries  and  ecosystems  are  likely  occurring  that  are  far  more  difficult  to  dis-
cern.

• A coordinated national HAB Program was created over 15 years ago and par-
tially  implemented.  That  National  Plan  is  now  outdated,  and  as  a  result,  a
new  plan  called  HARRNESS  has  been  formulated  to  guide  the  next  decade
or more of activities in HAB research and management.

• At the programmatic level, several of the existing national partnerships (e.g.,
ECOHAB, MERHAB, COHH, OHHI) should be sustained and expanded with-
in  HARRNESS,  and  new  programs  will  need  to  be  added.  In  the  latter  con-
text, a separate program on HABs and food web impacts could focus resources
on  this  important  topic  area  in  a  way  that  is  not  presently  possible  through
ECOHAB.  The  chemistry  and  toxicology  of  HABs  requires  focused  attention
and  a  targeted  funding  initiative.  Likewise  the  practical  aspects  of  HAB  pre-
vention,  control  and  mitigation  need  to  be  implemented  through  a  targeted
program.

• State  agencies  are  doing  an  excellent  job  protecting  public  health  and  fish-
eries, but those monitoring programs are facing growing challenges. Needs for
the  future  include  new  technologies  for  HAB  monitoring  and  forecasting  and
incorporation of these tools into regional Ocean Observing Systems.

Recommendations:

• Sustain and enhance support for the national HAB program HARRNESS.
• Sustain  and  enhance  support  for  the  ECOHAB,  MERHAB  and  OHH  pro-
grams,  and  implement  new  programs,  such  as  Prevention,  Control  and  Miti-
gation  of  HABs  (RDDTT  or  MACHAB)  that  include  Event  Response  and  In-
frastructure elements.

• Encourage  interagency  partnerships,  as  the  HAB  problem  transcends  the  re-

sources or mandate of any single agency.

• Identify  and  authorize  freshwater  programs  that  would  fall  under  the  pur-
view of relevant agencies, such as EPA, in addition to the marine and coastal
programs  authorized  in  NOAA.  Separate  funding  lines  are  needed  since
NOAA has a geographic mandate that includes marine coastal waters and the
upper reaches of estuaries, and the Great Lakes. Many freshwater HAB prob-
lems  fall  outside  these  boundaries,  however,  and  therefore  will  need  to  be
supported through separate appropriations.

• Support  methods  and  instrument  development  for  land-  and  mooring-based
cell  and  toxin  detection,  and  for  bloom  forecasting  through  instrument  devel-
opment support for the Integrated Ocean Observing System.

• Support  appropriations  that  are  commensurate  with  the  scale  of  the  HAB
problem.  The  national  HAB  program  is  well  established  and  productive,  but
it  needs  additional  resources  if  new  topics,  responsibilities  and  tasks  are
added  through  new  legislation.  Research  should  be  peer-reviewed  and  com-

petitive,  and  should  take  full  advantage  of  the  extensive  capabilities  of  the
extramural research community.

Mr.  Chairman,  that  concludes  my  testimony.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to
offer information that is based on my own research and policy activities, as well as
on  the  collective  wisdom  and  creativity  of  numerous  colleagues  in  the  HAB  field.  I
would  be  pleased  to  answer  any  questions  that  you  or  other  Members  may  have.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Background

The  marine  and  freshwaters  of  many  countries  are  increasingly  impacted  by  the
growing environmental and socioeconomic problem of harmful algal blooms (HABs).
HABs  are  proliferations  of  marine  and  freshwater  algae  that  can  produce  toxins  or
accumulate  in  sufficient  numbers  to  alter  ecosystems  in  detrimental  ways.  These
blooms are often referred to as ‘‘red tides,’’ but it is now recognized that such blooms
may  also  be  green,  yellow,  brown,  or  even  without  visible  color,  depending  on  the
type of organisms present. HABs is a more appropriate descriptor.

In  U.S.  waters  HABs  are  found  in  expanding  numbers  of  locations  and  are  also
increasing  in  duration  and  severity.  Further,  new  HAB  species  or  impacts  have
emerged to pose additional threats to human and ecosystem health in particular re-
gions.  The  expansion  in  HABs  has  led  to  increased  awareness  of  impacts  such  as
poisonous  seafood,  toxin-contaminated  drinking  water,  and  mortality  of  fish  and
other  animals  (including  protected  and  endangered  species),  public  health  and  eco-
nomic  impacts  in  coastal  and  lakeside  communities,  losses  to  aquaculture  enter-
prises, and long-term aquatic ecosystem changes.

The  1998  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  and  Hypoxia  Research  and  Control  Act
(HABHRCA 1998) established research programs to address the U.S. HAB problem.
When  HABHRCA  was  reauthorized  and  expanded  to  include  freshwater  in  2004
(HABHRCA  2004),  it  required  four  interagency  reports  and  plans  to  assess  U.S.
HAB  problems  and  update  priorities  for  federal  research  and  response  programs.
The  first,  the  National  Assessment  of  Efforts  to  Predict  and  Respond  to  Harmful
Algal Blooms in U.S. Water (Prediction and Response Report 2007), assesses the ex-
tent of the HAB problem in the U.S., details federal, State, and tribal prediction and
response  programs,  emphasizing  federal  efforts,  and  highlights  opportunities  to  im-
prove HAB prediction and response efforts and associated infrastructure. A strategy
to  address  these  needs  for  both  marine  and  freshwaters  will  be  included  in  the  fol-
low up HABHRCA 2004 report, the National Scientific Research, Development, Dem-
onstration, and Technology Transfer Plan (RDDTT Plan) on Reducing Impacts from
Harmful  Algal  Blooms,  which  will  be  derived  in  part  from  this  Workshop  Report.
Besides  addressing  the  needs  identified  in  the  Prediction  and  Response  Report,  the
RDDTT  Plan  will  also  address  issues  raised  in  three  recent  reports  developed  by
the  HAB  management  and  research  community,  Harmful  Algal  Research  and  Re-
sponse,  A  National  Environmental  Science  Strategy  (HARRNESS,  2005),  Harmful
Algal Research and Response: A Human Dimensions Strategy (HARR–HD 2006), and
the  Proceedings  of  the  Interagency,  International  Symposium  on  Cyanobacterial
Harmful  Algal  Blooms:  State  of  the  Science  and  Research  Needs  (ISOCHAB  2007).

Process for Developing the RDDTT Program

Input  for  the  RDDTT  Plan  was  solicited  from  both  the  marine  and  freshwater
HAB research and management communities during a workshop in Woods Hole, MA
June 22–25, 2007. This RDDTT Workshop Report summarizes the current status of
the  field,  recommends  a  program  to  improve  HAB  prediction  and  response  (Box  1),
and  suggests  an  implementation  process.  The  RDDTT  Plan,  which  will  be  written
by  the  Joint  Committee  on  Ocean  Science  and  Technology  Interagency  Working
Group  on  Harmful  Algal  Blooms,  Hypoxia,  and  Human  Health  and  submitted  to
Congress, will draw from these recommendations.

The  workshop  attendees  proposed  approaches  for  an  RDDTT  Program  with  three
essential  components,  based  on  the  opportunities  for  advancement  identified  in  the
reports  cited  above.  These  are  1)  an  extramural  funding  program  focused  on  devel-
opment,  demonstration,  and  technology  transfer  of  methods  for  prevention,  control,
and mitigation (PCM) of HABs; 2) a comprehensive national HAB Event Response
program: and 3) a Core Infrastructure program to support HAB research and re-
sponse.  All  three  components  require  social  science  research  related  to  ‘‘human  di-
mensions’’  and  call  for  the  meaningful  engagement  of  at  risk  and  affected  commu-
nities. These components are interdependent and critical for improving future HAB
response (Box 1).

Prevention,  Control,  and  Mitigation  (PCM)  Development,  Demonstration,

and Technology Transfer

The  PCM  component  or  sub-program  of  the  RDDTT  Program  focuses  on  moving
promising technologies and strategies, arising from HAB research from development
through  demonstration  to  technology  transfer  and  field  application  by  end-users.
Programs  that  would  feed  technologies  to  the  PCM  component  would  include  pro-
grams  such  as  the  Ecology  of  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  (ECOHAB),  Monitoring  and
Event Response (MERHAB), Sea Grant, and Oceans and Human Health (OHH), As
shown in Box 2, the program work would flow in three distinct stages: 1) The Devel-
opment phase (Phase 1) advances and evaluates unproven but promising PCM tech-
nologies  and  strategies.  2)  The  Demonstration  phase  (Phase  2)  tests,  validates  and
evaluates technologies in the field across a broad temporal and spatial scale. 3) The
Technology Transfer phase (Phase 3) facilitates the transition of proven technologies
and  strategies  to  end-users.  End-users,  including  local,  State,  and  federal  resource
and  public  health  managers,  non-profit  organizations,  and  a  variety  of  businesses
must  be  involved  in  all  three  phases.  Projects  can  enter  the  extramural  PCM  pro-
gram at any phase and would be selected through peer review competition. Socially
responsible  development  and  effective  implementation  are  ensured  by  the  inclusion
of social science research in all phases.

Many promising options are already available to feed into the PCM sub-program.
Example  focal  areas  within  the  prevention  category  include  modifications  of  hydro-
dynamic conditions in areas subject to HABs, or methods to avoid introducing HABs
cells and cysts as invasive species. Although nutrient reduction is also a very prom-
ising  strategy  for  HAB  prevention,  many  nutrient  management  programs  already
exist  and  are  motivated  by  issues  other  than  HABs.  Methods  of  control  or  bloom
suppression  through  the  removal  of  HAB  cells  or  toxins  by  biological,  chemical,  or
mechanical  means  are  ready  for  further  investigation.  For  example,  mechanical  re-
moval of cells and toxins by clay flocculation is one approach that has already been
tested in pilot field studies, so it is ready for further Phase 2 evaluation. A number
of biological control methods are ready for Phase 1 development studies in the field,
with  concomitant  research  needed  in  risk  communication  to  foster  public  under-

standing and participation in decision-making about potentially controversial strate-
gies.  Many  opportunities  exist  to  improve  mitigation  activities  that  reduce  the  im-
pacts  of  HABs.  A  few  examples  include  new  methods  of  monitoring  and  forecasting
HAB cells and toxins, maintaining safe seafood, water, and beaches, preventing and
treating human and animal disease syndromes, assessing the socioeconomic impacts
of HABs and the effectiveness of PCM strategies, and advancing education and out-
reach.

All  PCM  projects  will  be  extramural,  competitive,  peer-reviewed  and  funded
through an annual request for proposals that will ensure priorities for research and
implementation are based both on societal needs and scientific promise of effective-
ness.  End-user  input  to  proposals  in  all  phases  and  external  advisory  committee
guidance  for  Phase  2  and  3  projects  will  facilitate  technical  success  and  maximize
socioeconomic  benefits  and  opportunities.  Involvement  of  researchers  and  user
groups throughout the PCM development, demonstration, and implementation proc-
esses  will  ensure  that  projects  with  the  most  societal  relevance  are  supported  and
brought into operational use.

Event Response

In  order  to  mitigate  the  impacts  of  HABs,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  further  de-
velop  the  capacity  for  anticipating  events  and  responding  rapidly.  The  range  of
stakeholders  involved  in  event  response  depends  upon  the  nature  of  the  HAB,  the
geographic  area  affected  and  the  implications  for  human,  fish,  and  wildlife  health.
States, counties, tribes, and academic researchers are generally the first responders.
The aquaculture industry in some instances has also acted as front-line responders.
When  HAB  events  occur  on  small,  localized  scales,  the  capacity  and  financial  re-
sources of individual states usually are sufficient to respond quickly and effectively.
A good example is the Maine shellfish monitoring and closure program. Under nor-
mal conditions, the state is able to mitigate adverse public health outcomes through
the  imposition  of  carefully  timed  and  positioned  shellfish  closures.  Many  other
states also have successful programs in place to manage shellfish closures.

50

As  HABs  are  occurring  at  larger  scales,  greater  frequency  and  scope  of  impact
than  in  the  past,  or  involve  species  that  are  new  to  State  or  regional  waters,  the
capacity for responding rapidly is sometimes inadequate or nonexistent. In addition,
freshwater  HAB  events  are  occurring  in  states  that  have  never  before  needed  a  ca-
pacity for response. Toxic freshwater blooms can threaten public water supplies and
lead to widespread recreational impacts.

The insufficient capacity for adequate responses to new or large-scale HAB events
is in part a product of inexperience, lack of resources, and the unpredictable nature
of  such  events.  It  is  costly  and  time-consuming  to  develop  a  response  capacity  for
events  that  are  sporadic  or  rare,  or  for  those  that  have  increased  in  frequency  and
scale, and for which damages are uncertain. These characteristics argue strongly for
a  national  and  regional  approaches  to  event  response.  In  effect,  such  a  program
helps a region or the Nation insure itself against the public health effects, ecological
impacts,  and  economic  damages  that  could  arise  from  unusual,  unpredictable,  and
devastating HAB events.

It  is  clear  that  HAB  event  response  capacities  need  to  be  expanded  at  a  national
level. Existing program will not be able to address anticipated increases in HAB fre-
quency and intensity.

The proposed Event Response component of the RDDTT Program improves access
to  existing  resources  through  better  information  sharing,  communication,  and  co-
ordination  and  provides  essential  new  resources.  A  regionally  based,  federal  HAB
Event Response Program is proposed with National Marine and Freshwater Coordi-
nators,  possibly  residing  in  NOAA  and  EPA,  potentially  linked  to  a  network  of  Re-
gional  Coordinators.  Coordinators  would  maintain  web  sites  cataloging  regionally
available  resources,  assist  in  developing  regional  response  plans,  organize  training
and  information-sharing  workshops,  and  provide  coordination  during  events,  if  re-
quested  by  regional,  State,  or  local  authorities.  The  Regional  Coordinators  would
also request resources from other regions and, if needed, request funding from a na-
tional  Event  Response  Contingency  Fund,  modeled  after  the  current,  but  inad-
equately  funded  NOAA  Event  Response  Program  (http://www.cop.noaa.gov/
stressors/extremeevents/hab/current/fact-ev¥resp.html).  A  national  Technical  As-
sistance Fund would provide extramural funds for activities designed to improve re-
sponse to future events; activities would be selected by competitive peer review.

CORE Infrastructure

The  past  decade  has  resulted  in  tremendous  advances  in  the  community’s  under-
standing of HAB dynamics, from physiology and toxin expression to bloom transport
and economic impact. The general increase in knowledge has been matched by rapid
expansion  in  the  capability  for  toxin  and  species  detection  using  laboratory,  hand-
held,  and  in-  and  above-water  technologies.  Advancements  in  both  basic  knowledge
and  in  methods  and  tools  have  led  to  significant  new  opportunities  for  furthering
understanding and for protecting human health. However, as the field has matured,
the  infrastructure  needs  of  the  community  have  also  increased.  These  core  needs
form  the  foundations  upon  which  the  science  and  its  management  applications  de-
pend.  Many  of  the  associated  costs  are  far  greater  than  can  be  borne  by  individual
investigators  or  end-users.  These  needs  cross-cut  science  and  management  and
bridge individual agency interests. While in some cases they may intersect with the
goals  of  other  U.S.  programs  already  in  place,  existing  programs  are  inadequate  to
meet these requirements. The needs for critical infrastructure were identified in the
first National HAB plan in 1993 and strongly reiterated in the revised national plan
for 2005–2015 (HARRNESS 2005). Critical infrastructural needs can now be identi-
fied  and  efforts  made  to  obtain  the  financial  and  administrative  support  needed  to

52

make them a reality, with an ultimate goal of growing a greater community through
collaboration.

Researching and implementing new PCM strategies and improving event response
will not be possible without enhancing CORE infrastructure, including 1) increasing
availability of adequate analytical facilities, reference and research materials, toxin
standards,  culture  collections,  tissue  banks,  technical  training,  and  access  to  data;
2)  improving  integration  of  HAB  activities  with  existing  monitoring  and  emerging
observational programs; and 3) enhancing communication and regional and national
coordination.  Two  complementary  approaches  are  proposed  to  accomplish  these
goals:  1)  Establish  an  interagency,  competitive,  peer  reviewed  extramural  funding
program  that  will  support  CORE  infrastructure  needs  and  2)  Develop  a  regional
network  with  national  and  regional  coordinators  to  leverage  existing  resources,  en-
courage coordination and foster active communications with users and stake holders
within and between regions.

RDDTT Program Implementation

The  proposed  RDDTT  Program  (Box  1)  is  comprised  of  three  components:  1)  a
component  for  HAB  prevention,  control,  and  mitigation  (PCM),  2)  an  Event  Re-
sponse  component,  and  3)  a  Core  Infrastructure  component.  The  need  and  commu-
nity readiness for each varies with the status of currently existing research and the
planning  required  for  each  activity.  The  RDDTT  program  can,  therefore,  be  imple-
mented  in  stages  corresponding  to  the  reauthorizations  of  HABHRCA  every  five
years,  with  projected  funding  needs  increasing  as  the  components  mature  (Box  4).
The  PCM  component  forms  the  core  of  the  RDDTT  Program  because  it  is  only
through PCM that the grave risks posed by HAB expansion can be successfully con-
fronted in the long-term. Thus, in the first stage (FY09–FY13), the greatest empha-
sis  is  on  developing  the  PCM  component  because  many  promising  technologies,  de-
veloped through other HAB research programs, are ready to be transitioned to oper-
ational  use.  Since  CORE  infrastructure  and  Event  Response  are  integral  to  devel-
oping  HAB  response,  these  programs  should  be  initiated  in  the  first  five  years,  but
not fully implemented until the next five year reauthorization (FY14–FY18).

Implementation  requires  both  changes  in  authorizing  legislation  and  increases  in
appropriations.  Although  the  RDDTT  will  be  the  program  that  the  public  will  most
readily  perceive  as  ‘progress’  in  the  management  of  HABs,  the  program  is  part  of
an  integrated  approach  to  HAB  risk  management  that  includes  other  research  and
response programs. Thus, it is essential that the RDDTT program be established as
a separate element within the national HAB program (HARRNESS 2005), with the
expectation that related HAB research and response programs will provide the inno-
vative new technologies and approaches as well as the ecological and oceanographic
context  to  guide  its  practical  and  applied  activities.  When  HABHRCA  is  reauthor-
ized,  the  RDDTT  program  should  therefore  be  highlighted  along  with  the  existing
ECOHAB  and  MERHAB  programs,  with  the  three  components  of  the  RDDTT  Pro-
gram specifically listed.

Since  many  agencies  are  involved  in  HAB  research  and  response,  it  will  be  nec-
essary  to  specify  that  the  RDDTT  Program  is  an  interagency  program  and  to  pro-
vide funding to agencies with major roles. In particular the HABHRCA reauthoriza-
tion  should  identify  and  authorize  freshwater  programs  that  would  fall  under  the
purview  of  relevant  agencies,  such  as  EPA,  in  addition  to  the  marine  and  coastal
programs  authorized  in  NOAA.  Separate  funding  lines  are  needed  since  NOAA  has
a  geographic  mandate  that  includes  marine  coastal  waters  and  the  upper  reaches
of  estuaries,  and  the  Great  Lakes.  Many  freshwater  HAB  problems  fall  outside
these  boundaries,  however,  and  therefore  will  need  to  be  supported  through  sepa-
rate  appropriations  to  the  EPA.  Other  agencies,  such  as  FDA,  CDC,  NSF,  NIEHS,
and  USGS,  also  contribute  substantially  and  should  be  named  as  partners  in  the
national HAB program.

Funding to implement the freshwater and marine components of the RDDTT pro-
gram over the next five years (FY09–FY13) is roughly projected to be equivalent to
that  of  the  ECOHAB  and  MERHAB  programs.  Full  implementation  will  thus  re-
quire additional funding of $6.5M (FY08) to $10.5M (FY13).

Benefits of RDDTT Implementation

Full implementation of all the components of an RDDTT Program will yield many
benefits  for  the  public  health  and  management  communities  and  for  residents,  re-
source users, businesses and other stakeholders in at-risk and affected communities.
It will also address many of the frustrations people living in HAB impacted commu-
nities  experience  and  provide  them  with  new  strategies  to  address  the  problems.
These benefits include:

• Healthier fisheries industries selling seafood that is safer with respect to bio-

• Reductions  in  the  frequency  and  impacts  of  highly  toxic  or  large,  unsightly

and noxious accumulations of algae;

• Ecosystems that are less threatened by invasions of non-indigenous HAB spe-

• Mitigation of bloom impacts using a suite of practical, previous tested strate-

toxins;

gies;

tion;

to events;

• Sophisticated  yet  less  expensive,  easy  to  operate  instruments  for  HAB  detec-

• Teams  of  scientists,  managers,  and  community  leaders  prepared  to  respond

• Improved  prediction  and  early  warning  of  blooms  and  HAB  impacts  due  to
better  predictive  models,  networks  of  moored  automated  observing  systems,
and satellite surveillance capability for detection and tracking over large dis-
tances;

• Improved human health and ecosystem risk assessment;
• Effective means of educating and warning the public.

The  fully-implemented  RDDTT  Program  will  link  science  and  management  to
achieve vastly improved mitigation, control, and prevention, and education. Full im-
plementation  will  not  be  simple  and  will  require  substantial  investment.  The  socio-
economic costs of not addressing these needs, however, greatly exceed the projected
investment.

STATEMENT OF MR. DAN L. AYRES, FISH AND WILDLIFE BIOL-
OGIST, COASTAL SHELLFISH LEAD, WASHINGTON STATE DE-
PARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE REGION SIX OFFICE
Mr.  AYRES.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,

thank you for the opportunity to speak today.

I  represent  coastal  fisheries  and  human  health  managers  not
only  from  Washington  State  but  also  from  around  the  Nation  who
face  the  task  of  providing  citizens  with  access  to  some  of  the  most
productive  fish  and  shellfish  resources  while  protecting  those  citi-
zens  from  the  threats  produced  by  harmful  algal  blooms.  I  have
spent  a  significant  portion  of  my  career  working  for  the  Wash-
ington  State  Department  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  managing  a  key
shellfish  fishery,  the  harvest  of  the  Pacific  razor  clam.  This  abun-
dant and very delicious shellfish species has long been a part of the
lifeblood  of  the  small  communities  that  line  Washington’s  Pacific
coast. Over 250,000 avid razor claim harvesters are drawn to these
small  Washington  towns  during  the  periods  when  this  fishery  is
open, bringing with them millions of dollars spent on lodging, food,
gas  and  entertainment.  One  local  restaurant  owner  left  me  a  mes-
sage  on  my  office  phone  saying  that  a  recent  morning  razor  clam
opener  meant  an  additional  $8,000  in  sales,  important  income  for
him and his employees. Then just last week, as I sat in a small res-
taurant in the Pacific county town of Long Beach, I overhead a con-
versation  between  a  waiter  and  some  out-of-town  customers.  He
told them the only way the restaurant can survive the winter is the
few days each month the state opens the razor clam fishery.

In  addition  to  the  economic  impact,  one  cannot  overlook  the  sig-
nificant  role  the  ability  to  dig  for  razor  clams  plays  in  the  lives  of
so  many  Washington  residents.  The  joy  of  joining  with  family  and
friends  to  brave  the  elements  to  harvest  these  shellfish  and  then
return  home  to  prepare  a  big  meal  of  fresh  razor  clams  cannot  be
overlooked.  These  kinds  of  activities  have  gone  on  for  one  for  gen-
erations  for  coastal  families  and  they  are  a  big  part  of  the  social
fabric of these communities.

However, the opening of this fishery does not come cheaply to the
State of Washington. Each monthly opener must be preceded by fa-
vorable  results  from  work  conducted  both  by  my  agency  and  the
Washington Department of Health sampling for harmful algal spe-
cies and the testing for levels of toxin in clam tissue.

Razor clams are also important to tribal communities not only for
subsistence  but  also  for  income  generated  by  the  sales  of  clams  to
commercial  harvests  conducted  by  the  tribes.  My  agency  works

closely  with  the  Quinault  Indian  Nation  to  jointly  manage  razor
clams  along  a  portion  of  the  Washington  coast  and  we  share  the
monitoring for harmful algae.

But amidst all the good news about successful harvests and posi-
tive economic impacts on small communities is the very real threat
of closures as a result of significant increases in harmful algal spe-
cies  and  the  uptake  of  toxins  by  these  tasty  shellfish.  These  clo-
sures  can  be  devastating  events  that  have  lasted  up  to  a  year  or
more.  Closures  heavily  impact  the  citizens  who  count  on  these
shellfish for a portion of their livelihood.

Many  other  coastal  managers  from  around  this  nation  could  tell
you  similar  stories  of  how  important  our  coastal  resources  are  to
the  citizens  of  our  nation  and  the  devastating  impacts  HABs  have
had on the fabric of other U.S. coastal communities.

Over  the  last  several  years,  I  have  had  the  pleasure  of  getting
to know many of these other coastal managers as we were brought
together by NOAA to assist in the preparation of the National Plan
for Harmful Algal Toxins and Harmful Algal Blooms, as Dr. Ander-
son  referred  to,  the  HARRNESS  plan.  This  document  was  made
much stronger by bringing together federal and academic scientists
and  the  State-level  managers.  The  process  was  a  unique  oppor-
tunity for each of these groups to teach the other about their work,
their  struggles  and  the  goals  they  share.  This  process  and  the  re-
sulting  plan  have  spawned  other  important  endeavors  including
the  Harmful  Algal  Research  and  Response,  a  Human  Dimension
Strategy, which brought key social scientists with HAB researchers
and  coastal  managers  to  define  and  dress  the  impacts  HABs  have
on what I described earlier, the social fabric of the affected commu-
nities.  A  more  recent  NOAA-sponsored  workshop  brought  together
a  larger  group  of  HAB  researchers  and  coastal  managers  from
around the Nation to provide input into the National Scientific Re-
search, Development, Demonstration and Technology Transfer Plan
on Reducing Impacts from Harmful Algal Blooms, the RDDTT plan
that Dr. Magnien referred to.

In Washington State, we have also followed this model by bring-
ing  together  Northwest-based  federal  HAB  researchers,  University
of  Washington  oceanographers  and  algal  experts,  State  and  tribal
fishery  managers  and  human  health  experts  to  form  a  successful
partnership,  the  Olympic  Region  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  Project.
Begun in 2000 with funds from NOAA’s Monitoring and Event Re-
sponse  for  HABs  program,  it  is  now  solely  funded  by  State  dollars
generated  through  a  surcharge  on  shellfish  licenses.  Working  to-
gether, we are doing what we can to monitor our shellfish and our
waters to ensure the safe continuation of the state’s important fish-
eries.

Using  the  example  of  Washington’s  razor  clam  fishery,  I  hope  I
have provided you with a better understanding of what our nation’s
ocean  resources  mean  to  the  citizens  of  our  small  coastal  commu-
nities.  I  hope  you  also  see  the  impact  HAB  events  have  had  on
these  communities  and  how  important  the  continued  involvement
of the Federal Government in bringing the experts and the needed
resources  to  the  better  understanding  and  perhaps  in  the  future
control of these events is to our State and local governments.

And  finally,  I  hope  you  see  the  value  in  using  federal  resources
to continue to bring all the players, State, tribal, academic and fed-
eral,  to  the  table  to  jointly  address  the  issues  presented  by  the
presence of harmful algae.

Thank you again for the opportunity to be here today.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Ayres follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAN L. AYRES

I am pleased to submit this prepared testimony to Members of the Subcommittee
on  Energy  and  Environment  of  the  United  States  House  of  Representatives.  This
testimony will provide Members of the Subcommittee detail on the impacts that the
continued presence of harmful algal blooms have had on Washington State’s ability
to manage important fisheries.

As  a  Washington  State  coastal  shellfishery  manager,  I  am  part  of  a  large  group
of  fishery  and  human  health  managers  from  around  the  Nation  who  daily  face  the
task  of  providing  the  citizens  we  serve  with  access  to  some  of  the  most  productive
fish  and  shellfish  resources  and  most  beautiful,  inviting  beaches  this  nation  has  to
offer,  while  still  protecting  those  citizens  from  the  threats  posed  by  re-occurring
harmful algal blooms.

Along  the  coast  of  Washington  State  our  primary  problems  are  associated  with
the  naturally  occurring  algal  species—the  diatom  Pseudonitzschia,  which  can
produce  dangerous  levels  of  the  neurotoxin  domoic  acid.1 In  the  inland  marine  wa-
ters of Puget Sound, wide area closures are associated with another naturally occur-
ring  algal  species—the  dinoflagellate  Alexandrium,  which  produces  the  neurotoxin
saxitoxin.2 The  presence  of  these  same  species—along  with  a  long  list  of  others—
has resulted in major problems for resource users in most of our coastal states.

Having  grown  up  on  the  Washington  coast,  I  am  blessed  to  have  spent  a  signifi-
cant portion of my career working for the Washington State Department of Fish and
Wildlife,  (WDFW),  managing  a  key  shellfish  fishery  that  occurs  along  the  Wash-
ington  coast—the  harvest  of  the  Pacific  razor  clam.3 This  abundant  and  very  deli-
cious  shellfish  species  has  long  been  part  of  the  lifeblood  of  the  small  communities
that  line  Washington’s  coast.  Each  year  more  than  250,000  avid  razor  clam  har-
vesters  are  drawn  to  the  small  Washington  towns  like  Long  Beach,  Ocean  Park,
Grayland, Westport, Ocean Shores, Moclips and Forks during the periods when this
fishery  is  open  between  October  and  May,  bringing  with  them  millions  of  dollars
spent on lodging, food, gas and entertainment.

One local restaurant owner left a message on my office phone—a message I have
saved  to  remind  me  of  the  importance  our  work  has.  In  the  message  he  tells  me
that  a  recent  morning  razor  clam  opener  meant  an  additional  $8,000  in  sales—im-
portant income for him and his employees. Then just last week—as I sat in a small
restaurant in the Pacific County town of Long Beach I overheard a conversation be-
tween  the  waiter  and  some  out-of-town  customers.  He  told  them  the  only  way  the
restaurant  can  survive  the  winter  is  the  few  days  each  month  the  state  opens  the
razor clam fishery.

We  are  excited  to  see  the  results  of  a  soon-to-be-completed  NOAA-funded  eco-
nomic  study  by  researchers  at  the  University  of  Washington.  This  study  was  de-
signed to update decades-old economic information regarding how much money was
spent  by  each  razor  clam  digger  during  a  trip.  It  will  give  WDFW  new  and  clearer
insight to the true impact this shellfish fishery has on local economies.

In  addition  to  the  economic  impact,  one  cannot  overlook  the  significant  role  the
ability  to  participate  in  this  fishery  plays  in  the  lives  of  so  many  Washington  resi-
dents.  The  joy  of  joining  with  family  and  friends  to  brave  the  elements  to  harvest

1 Eating of fish and shellfish containing domoic acid causes the human illness known as amne-
sic  shellfish  poisoning  (ASP).  Symptoms  include  vomiting,  nausea,  diarrhea  and  abdominal
cramps within 24 hours of ingestion. In more severe cases, neurological symptoms develop with-
in  48  hours  and  include  headache,  dizziness,  confusion,  disorientation,  loss  of  short-term  mem-
ory, motor weakness, seizures, profuse respiratory secretions, cardiac arrhythmia, coma. People
poisoned  with  very  high  doses  of  the  toxin  can  die.  There  is  no  antidote  for  domoic  acid.  Re-
search  has  shown  that  razor  clams  accumulate  domoic  acid  in  edible  tissue  (foot,  siphon  and
mantle) and are slow to depurate (purify) the toxin.

2 Eating  of  fish  and  shellfish  containing  saxitoxin  causes  human  illness  known  a  paralytic
shellfish  poisoning  (PSP).  Symptoms  include  tingling  of  the  lips  followed  by  paralyzing  of  the
diaphragm and possible death.

these shellfish and then return home to prepare a big meal of fresh razor clams can-
not  be  overlooked.  These  kinds  of  activities  have  gone  on  for  generations  of  coastal
families and are a big part of the social fabric of these communities.

However, the opening of this fishery does not come cheaply to the State of Wash-
ington.  Each  monthly  opener4 must  be  preceded  by  favorable  results  from  regular
sampling  WDFW  conducts  to  monitor  for  the  presence  of  harmful  algal  species.
Then,  the  Washington  State  Department  of  Health  checks  the  levels  of  toxin  in
razor  clam  tissue.  The  tissue  testing,  which  can  take  some  time,  must  have  good
results before the go-ahead for a razor clam opener can be given.

Razor clams are also depended on heavily by tribal communities not only for sub-
sistence but also for the income generated by the sales of razor clams through com-
mercial  razor  clam  harvests  conducted  by  the  tribes.  My  agency  works  closely  with
the  Quinault  Indian  Nation  to  jointly  manage  razor  clams  along  a  portion  of  the
Washington  coast  and  we  share  the  work  we  need  to  do  to  monitor  for  harmful
algae. Researchers funded by the National Institute of Health are conducting an on-
going  study  of  subsistence  users  of  shellfish  that  have  low  levels  of  some  of  these
marine  toxins.  The  results  of  this  study  could  potentially  require  major  changes  in
the way some fisheries are managed.

Amidst all the good news about successful harvests and positive economic impacts
on  small  communities  is  the  very  real  threat  of  closures  as  the  result  of  significant
increases in harmful algal species and the uptake of toxins by these tasty shellfish.
These  closures  do  not  last  just  a  few  days  they  are  devastating  events  that  have
lasted  a  year  or  more.5 These  closures  heavily  impact  the  citizens  who  count  on
these shellfish for a portion of their livelihood.

Many  other  coastal  managers  from  around  this  nation  could  tell  you  similar  sto-
ries of how important our coastal resources are to the citizens of our nation and the
devastating impacts HABs have had on the fabric of other coastal communities.

Over  the  last  several  years  I  have  had  the  pleasure  of  getting  to  know  many  of
these other coastal managers as we were brought together by NOAA to assist in the
preparation  of  the  National  Plan  for  Algal  Toxins  and  Harmful  Algal  Blooms—also
know  as  HARRNESS—Harmful  Algae  Research  and  Response  National  Environ-
mental and Science Strategy.6 This document was made much stronger by bringing
together  federal  and  academic  scientists  and  the  State  level  managers.  The  process
was  a  unique  opportunity  for  each  of  these  groups  to  ‘‘teach’’  the  other  about  their
work, their struggles and the goals that they all share. This process and the result-
ing  plan  have  spawned  other  important  and  similar  endeavors.  One  of  these,  the
Harmful  Algal  Research  and  Response;  A  Humans  Dimensions  Strategy7 brought
key social scientists together with HAB researchers and coastal managers to define
and  address  the  impacts  HABs  have  on  what  I  described  earlier—the  social  fabric
of affected coastal communities. A more recent NOAA-sponsored workshop I partici-
pated in brought together a larger group of HAB researchers and coastal managers
to provide input into the National Scientific Research, Development, Demonstration,
and  Technology  Transfer  Plan  on  Reducing  Impacts  from  Harmful  Algal  Blooms,
(RDDTT Plan).

In  Washington  State  we  have  also  followed  this  model  by  bringing  Seattle-based
NOAA  HAB  researchers,  University  of  Washington  oceanographers  and  algae  ex-
perts,  State  and  tribal  fishery  managers  and  human  health  experts  to  form  a  suc-
cessful  partnership  we  call  the  ORHAB—the  Olympic  Region  Harmful  Algal  Bloom
project.  This  endeavor  that  started  in  2000  with  funds  from  NOAA  Monitoring  and
Event Response for Harmful Algal Bloom program is now solely funded by State dol-
lars  generated  by  a  surcharge  on  shellfish  licenses.  Working  together  we  are  doing
what we can to monitor our shellfish and our waters to ensure the safe continuation
of  the  important  fisheries  I  have  described  earlier.  In  Washington  State  another
large,  nearly  completed  NOAA-funded  study  has  also  provided  a  better  under-
standing of the oceanic processes that result in large algal blooms forming off of our
coast and bringing them on-shore to affect the resources we manage. This multi-dis-
ciplinary  group  of  scientists  from  around  the  Nation  was  brought  together  as  part
of  the  Pacific  Northwest  ECOHAB  Project.  While  State  fishery  and  human  health

4 WDFW opens razor clam fisheries for a few days each month between October and May de-
pending  on  the  number  of  clams  available  for  harvest  and  safe  levels  of  marine  toxins  in  razor
clam tissue.

5 HAB events first disrupted the harvest of Washington’s razor clams in 1992 and have caused
three major coast-wide year-long closures since then, with additional numerous smaller area clo-
sures.

managers  were  not  directly  involved  in  the  project,  we  were  invited  into  planning
sessions to provide insight on what information would be most useful to our work.8
It  is  our  hope  you  have  a  better  understanding  of  what  our  nation’s  ocean  re-
sources mean to the citizens of our small coastal communities. We hope you see the
impact  HAB  events  have  on  these  communities  and  how  important  the  continued
involvement  of  the  Federal  Government  is  in  bringing  the  experts  and  the  needed
resources to better understanding and hopefully control of these events. And finally,

STATEMENT OF DR. HILTON KENNETH HUDNELL, VICE

PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR OF SCIENCE, SOLARBEE, INC.
Dr.  HUDNELL.  Good  morning,  and  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to

testify about freshwater HABs.

I  am  Dr.  Hilton  Kenneth  Hudnell  and  I  served  as  a
neurotoxicologist  at  the  U.S.  EPA  for  23  years,  where  I  led  an
interagency  effort  to  address  the  freshwater  HAB  problem.  I  am
now  an  adjunct  professor  at  the  University  of  North  Carolina  and
Vice President and Director of science for SolarBee Incorporated.

Today  I  will  tell  you  about  HAB  cells  and  their  toxins,  the  risks
they  pose  for  human  health  and  ecosystem  sustainability,  the  in-
crease in occurrence and causes of freshwater HABs, approaches to
preventing freshwater HABs and the need for improved legislation
to address HABs in all of our nation’s waters.

Freshwater HABs are primarily caused by cyanobacteria. Blooms
are  the  rapid  expansion  of  cells  to  huge  biomasses  often  seen  as
surface  scums  or  mats.  Cyanobacteria  have  been  around  for  three
billion  years.  They  developed  the  photosynthetic  process  and
pumped  oxygen  into  our  atmosphere.  About  50  types  make  highly
potent  toxins,  much  more  potent  than  industrial  chemicals  and
about  equally  potent  to  cobra  venom.  Many  make  multiple  toxins
and  many  make  the  same  toxins.  The  toxins  affect  the  liver,  nerv-
ous  system  and  other  organs.  The  toxins  threaten  human  health
and the sustainability of our aquatic ecosystems. Unfortunately, we
are making the earth a better place for them to live. The frequency
of freshwater HABs is increasing rapidly.

There are no U.S. regulations or guidelines for freshwater HABs.
The  EPA  has  not  assessed  the  risk  or  developed  a  national  re-
search  plan  for  freshwater  HABs.  The  World  Health  Organization
and  some  countries  have  developed  regulations  and  guidelines.
States and local governments are left without federal guidance.

Humans are exposed to HAB toxins in drinking and recreational
waters. There is no affordable method for removing all HAB toxins
from  drinking  water.  HAB  toxins  are  causing  acute,  chronic  and
delayed  health  effects.  Acute  effects  range  from  rapid  death  to  se-
vere  gastrointestinal  and  flu-like  illness.  Some  people  remain
chronically ill. Science indicates that repeated exposures cause can-
cers  and  probably  neurodegenerative  diseases  like  Alzheimer’s.  All
levels  of  aquatic  life  suffer  lethal  and  sublethal  effects  from  HAB
toxins. When HABs die off, they sink to the bottom and use up all
the oxygen. Millions of fish die annually due to lack of oxygen.

Scientists and water managers know the incidence of freshwater
HABs  is  increasing  rapidly  in  the  United  States  and  worldwide.
Each year HABs occur where they have not occurred before and for
longer  duration.  HABs  require  nutrients,  sunlight,  warmth  and
calm  water.  HABs  are  increasing  because  too  many  nutrients  are

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:32 Dec 26, 2008 Jkt 043278 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\071008\43278 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

67

going into our freshwaters, increasing temperatures and decreasing
flow  rates.  The  nutrients  come  from  point  sources  like  wastewater
treatment  plants  and  non-point  sources  like  fertilizer  runoff  from
our yards and farms. Water flow rates are dropping as demand in-
crease  and  droughts  are  more  frequent.  Climate  change  is  exacer-
bating the problem. Costs in the United States are estimated to be
many millions of dollars per year.

We  can  only  target  the  HAB  causes  of  nutrient  input  and  calm
water.  Nutrient  usage  should  be  reduced  and  nutrients  should  be
recaptured and reused. Water flow rates cannot easily be increased.
However,  water  can  be  circulated.  I  joined  SolarBee  because  I  be-
lieve  they  make  the  best  technology  for  moving  water  cheaply.
Floating platforms powered by solar cells circulate water over long
distances  continuously.  HABs  are  prevented  over  a  35-acre  area
per  unit  with  a  success  rate  of  95  percent.  Algaecide  usage  to  ter-
minate  HABs  is  dangerous  for  humans  and  cause  long-term  dam-
age to aquatic ecosystems.

HABHRCA  led  to  a  national  research  plan  for  HABs  in  oceans,
estuaries  and  the  Great  Lakes.  Funds  authorized  through  Com-
merce  to  NOAA  support  competitive  HAB  research  grants.  EPA
funding  was  not  authorized  but  EPA  was  statutorily  required  to
help  produce  a  scientific  assessment  of  freshwater  HABs  and  a
plan for a national research program to mitigate and control fresh-
water HABs. I helped prepare those documents. However, the EPA
then  unilaterally  determined  that  its  statutory  requirements  were
completed. There is no agency effort to develop or implement a na-
tional  research  program  for  freshwater  HABs.  The  agency  ceased
virtually  all  participation  in  freshwater  HAB  research  and  mitiga-
tion.  The  EPA  quit  funding  the  interagency  extramural  HAB  re-
search grant programs and ceased all HAB research in its National
Health and Environment Effects Research Laboratory.

Congress  should  pass  freshwater  HABHRCA  legislation  that  au-
thorizes  funding  for  and  requires  the  EPA  to  develop  and  imple-
ment a national research program for freshwater HABs. The agen-
cy should be directed to form partnerships through a strong extra-
mural  peer-viewed  competitive  research  grant  program  open  to  all
private  and  public  for-profit  and  non-profit  organizations.  Funding
should be directed to the existing interagency grants programs and
the  newly  proposed  RDDTT/MACHAB  program  for  HAB  control
technologies. Legislation will provide clarity to the EPA that fresh-
water  HAB  research  is  authorized  and  required.  Congress  should
then appropriate funds for freshwater HAB research. I would urge
the  House  Science  and  Technology  Committee,  which  has  primary
jurisdiction  over  EPA  research,  to  develop  and  advance  a  national
freshwater  HAB  research  bill.  I  am  pleased  to  offer  my  expertise
to help develop such authority for the EPA.

I  thank  the  Subcommittee  for  allowing  me  to  express  my  views

today.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HILTON KENNETH HUDNELL

Good morning to all in attendance today. Chairman Lampson and Ranking Mem-

I am Dr. Hilton Kenneth Hudnell. I served as a neurotoxicologist in the U.S. En-
vironmental  Protection  Agency’s  (EPA)  National  Health  and  Environmental  Effects
Research  Laboratory  for  23  years.  I  focused  on  the  human  health  effects  of  bio-
toxins,  toxins  produced  by  single  cell  organisms,  for  the  last  dozen  years.  I  led  an
interagency  effort  to  provide  the  scientific  basis  for  developing  a  National  Research
Plan 
freshwater  HABs—http://www.epa.gov/
cyano¥habs¥symposium/,  as  mandated  by  the  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  and  Hypoxia
Research  and  Control  Act  (HABHRCA,  as  reauthorized  in  2004).  That  effort  cul-
minated  this  year  in  the  publication  of  a  book  entitled  Cyanobacterial  Harmful
(1)  http://
Algal  Blooms:  State  of 
www.springer.com/biomed/neuroscience/book/978-0-387-75864-0,  and  the  Congres-
sionally  mandated  report,  Scientific  Assessment  of  Freshwater  Harmful  Algal
Blooms  (2).  I  am  currently  Vice  President  and  Director  of  Science  for  SolarBee,
Inc.—http://www.SolarBee.com/,  a  company  that  makes  solar  powered  water
circulators to solve water quality problems such as HABs, and an adjunct professor
in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Institute for the Environment—

the National HAB Committee, headquartered at Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

the  Science  and  Research  Needs 

Whereas Drs. Anderson, Ayres and Magnien’s testimony primarily concerns HABs
in  our  oceans,  estuaries  and  the  Great  Lakes,  I  will  talk  with  you  about  HABs  in
our  nation’s  inland  lakes,  ponds,  reservoirs,  streams  and  rivers.  Just  as  salt  levels
differ  between  freshwater,  estuaries  and  oceans,  so  do  their  ecosystems  and  the  or-
ganisms  that  cause  HABs  in  those  water  bodies.  Some  of  the  causes  of  HABs  in
those  environments  are  the  same,  such  as  over  enrichment  with  nutrients.  But  it
is  important  to  understand  the  differences  if  we  are  to  successfully  develop  strate-
gies  for  controlling  the  increasing  risks  of  freshwater  HABs  to  human  health,  the
sustainability of aquatic ecosystems and our nation’s economy. Today I will discuss:

• Freshwater HAB cells and their toxins
• Freshwater HAB risks for human health and ecosystem sustainability
• Occurrence, causes and costs of freshwater HABs
• Approaches to freshwater HAB control
• The  need  for  improved  legislation  to  comprehensively  address  HABs  from
freshwater  (EPA  jurisdiction)  to  oceans  (National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric
Administration (NOAH) jurisdiction)

Freshwater HAB cells and their toxins

Freshwater  HABs  are  primarily  caused  by  cyanobacteria,  although  similar  orga-
nisms such as golden algae also cause some of the freshwater blooms. Cyanobacteria
(a.k.a.  blue-green  algae)  are  single-cell  organisms  that  appear  in  the  fossil  record
from  about  three  billion  years  ago.  This  was  a  time  when  there  was  no  oxygen  in
our  atmosphere.  They  were  the  first  organisms  to  use  the  photosynthetic  process.
They  filled  our  atmosphere  with  oxygen,  enabling  the  existence  of  life  forms  such
as  our  own.  Cyanobacteria  have  proven  to  be  highly  resilient  organisms,  surviving
and  even  thriving  over  the  eons  as  dramatic  shifts  occurred  in  the  physical  and
chemical  characteristics  of  our  air,  water  and  land.  For  example,  some  are  able  to
‘‘fix’’  nitrogen;  they  can  take  unusable  forms  of  nitrogen  from  the  air  or  water  and
change  it  to  forms  they  can  use  for  nourishment.  Some  are  able  to  regulate  their
position in the water column through buoyancy control so they can make maximum
use  of  sunlight  or  nutrients  at  optimal  times.  Now  they  are  found  in  virtually  all
ecosystems,  but  are  primarily  a  problem  in  our  fresh-to-brackish  waters.  The  first
problem  is  that  cyanobacteria  ‘‘bloom’’  when  conditions  are  right.  They  rapidly  ex-
pand  their  population  from  a  few  cells  per  milliliter  of  water  to  dense  mats  of  or-
ganic  material  floating  on  the  water’s  surface  or  suspended  in  the  water  column.
These  huge  masses  of  organic  material  create  serious  problems  for  humans  and
aquatic  ecosystems,  as  explained  below.  The  second  and  more  serious  problem  is
that  cyanobacteria  often  produce  cyanotoxins,  some  of  the  most  potent  toxins
known.  It’s  as  if  a  single  cobra  could  become  a  hoard  of  cobras  overnight,  injecting
their toxic venom into the environment of all living things.

Cyanobacteria  genera  are  known  by  tongue-twisting  names  such  as  Microcystis,
Aphanizomenon,  Planktothrix,  Anabaena,  Cylindorspermopsis  and  Lyngbya.  Not  all
types  of  cyanobacteria  are  thought  to  make  toxins,  although  the  ones  I  named  can
make  multiple  toxins.  We  don’t  know  what  triggers  their  production  of  toxin,  or
what causes toxin production to stop. We don’t even know why they produce toxins;
the  toxins  are  not  essential  for  the  cells  to  live.  However,  it  is  generally  thought
that  the  toxins  provide  some  survival  advantage.  For  example,  the  toxins  kill  some
organisms  with  which  cyanobacteria  compete  for  space  to  grow  and  multiply.  The

toxins also inhibit grazing by some organisms that otherwise would be their preda-
tors.  Zooplankton  that  graze  the  good,  ‘‘edible’’  green  algae,  the  base  of  the  aquatic
food  chain,  often  avoid  grazing  the  ‘‘inedible’’  blue-greens.  Some  filter  feeders  such
as  the  zebra  mussel  seem  to  selectively  ‘‘spit  out’’  toxic  cyanobacteria  cells.  The  ar-
rival  of  zebra  mussels  in  the  Great  Lakes  coincided  with  the  resurgence  of  HABs
in the Great Lakes in recent years, and some scientists postulate this to be a cause
and  effect  relationship.  We  do  know  that  many  genera  of  cyanobacteria  make  not
only one type of toxin, but multiple types of toxins. We also know that many genera
make  the  same  toxins.  Other  types  of  plankton  also  make  some  of  the  toxins  made
by  cyanobacteria.  An  example  is  highly  potent  saxitoxin,  the  cause  of  Paralytic
Shellfish  Poisoning,  made  by  both  marine  dinoflagellates  and  cyanobacteria.  The
genes  responsible  for  toxin  production  are  distributed  widely  within  the  planktonic
world.

The  cyanotoxins  are  often  named  after  the  organism  first  discovered  to  produce
the  toxin,  such  as  microcystins,  cylindrospermopsins  and  anatoxins.  These  are
thought  to  be  the  priority  toxins  in  the  U.S.  because  of  their  high  potency  and  fre-
quent  occurrence.  Not  enough  is  known  about  saxitoxin  occurrence  in  U.S.
freshwaters to determine if it should be a priority cyanotoxin.

Cyanotoxins  are  among  the  most  potent  toxins  known,  far  more  potent  than  in-
dustrial  chemicals.  They  cause  death  at  dosage  levels  in  the  low  parts  per  billion
range.  For  example,  the  toxins  named  above  are  more  potent  than  strychnine,  cu-
rare (the poison dart toxin) and sarin (a nerve gas). One of the anatoxins is equiva-
lent in potency to cobra venom. Only a few toxins are more potent than cyanotoxins,
such as botulinum toxin (botulism) and ricin (derived from the castor bean). As little
as  a  mouthful  of  lake  water  containing  cyanotoxins  can  have  immediate  lethal  and
sub-lethal health effects.

The toxins are usually placed into one of three categories: 1) liver or hepatotoxins,
such as the microcystins; 2) neurotoxins, such as the anatoxins and saxitoxins, and;
3)  non-specific  toxins,  such  as  the  cylindrospermopsins.  The  classification  is  based
on the organ system in which failure is the cause of death at higher doses. However,
it is a mistake to think that any of these toxins affect only one organ system. Lower
dose  exposures  to  many  cyanotoxins  result  in  multiple-system  symptoms,  gastro-in-
testinal distress and flu-like illness.

Freshwater  HAB  risks  assessment:  human  health  and  ecosystem  sustain-

ability

HAB risk assessment. Whereas NOAA led the development of a National Research
Plan  for  addressing  HABs  in  oceans,  estuaries  and  the  Great  Lakes,  described  in
HARRNESS,  2005,  Harmful  Algal  Research  and  Response:  A  National  Environ-
mental Science Strategy (3), there is no National Research Plan for addressing HABs
in  our  rivers,  streams,  ponds,  reservoirs  and  other  lakes.  Although  many  risks  of
freshwater HABs and their toxins for human health and aquatic ecosystem sustain-
ability  are  well  known,  there  are  no  federal  guidelines  or  regulations  concerning
HAB  cells  or  toxins  in  U.S.  drinking  or  recreational  waters.  The  National  EPA
placed  cyanobacteria,  other  algae  and  their  toxins  on  their  first  Contaminant  Can-
didate List (CCL) for drinking water toxins in 1998. Regulatory determinations con-
cerning  contaminants  on  the  CCL,  and  revised  lists,  are  to  be  made  within  each
five-year period. However, no determinations have been made for cyanobacteria and
cyanotoxins.  They  are  currently  on  the  draft  CCL3  list.  The  National  offices  of  the
EPA  have  made  no  regulatory  determinations  concerning  HABs  in  recreational  wa-
ters.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and a number of countries have developed
guidelines or regulations for a few genera of cyanobacteria and their toxins. For ex-
ample,  the  WHO  developed  guidelines  for  Microcystis  and  microcystins.  Numerous
mortalities  in  Brazil  led  to  the  first  regulations  on  microcystins  in  drinking  water.
In  the  U.S.,  states  and  localities  confronted  by  HAB  risks  are  increasingly  relying
on  the  WHO  guidelines  to  develop  strategies  for  protecting  human  health.  States
developing  guidelines  for  cyanobacteria  include  California,  Florida,  Iowa,  Nebraska
and  Oregon.  This  year  the  Regional  EPA  office  in  Sacramento  ordered  that  Cali-
fornia  develop  the 
for  a
cyanobacterium and cyanotoxins in the U.S. The TMDL order requires California to
develop  a  plan  to  prevent  dangerous  levels  of  Microcystis  and  microcystins  in  por-
tions of the Klamath River. The Klamath regularly experiences some of the highest
levels of these cells and toxins seen anywhere in the world. Contentions have devel-
oped  between  some  State  and  local  agencies  as  localities  hurry  to  develop  regula-
tions concerning fertilizer usage before State legislation preempts such actions. Fed-

eral  leadership  is  badly  needed  to  assist  states  and  localities  in  meeting  the  chal-
lenges HABs pose for human health, ecosystem sustainability and economic vitality.
Human health effects. Exposures to cyanotoxins occur in recreational and finished
drinking  waters.  High-level  exposures  generally  occur  through  ingestion  of  rec-
reational  waters.  Lower-level  exposures  occur  through  inhalation  and  dermal  con-
tact.  Data  from  Florida  indicate  that  toxin  levels  in  finished  drinking  water  often
are  higher  than  in  source  waters.  HAB  cells  are  lysed  or  split  open  when  filtered
during water processing. The lysed cells release their toxin load into the water. Nor-
mal drinking water processing often does not remove the toxins. There is no known
and  affordable  method  to  remove  all  cyanotoxins  from  drinking  water.  Few,  if  any,
water utilities systematically monitor for HAB toxins. However, high-level exposures
through drinking water are probably rare. Cyanobacteria often make non-toxic com-
pounds  that  cause  noxious  tastes  and  odors.  Water  utilities  become  aware  of  the
taste  and  odor  problems.  They  either  implement  supplemental  treatment  processes
at  high  cost,  or  discontinue  drawing  water  from  the  contaminated  source  until  the
tastes and odors dissipate. The additional processing to remove taste and odor com-
pounds may reduce toxin levels sufficiently to prevent the most serious, acute health
effects.  However,  humans  are  repeatedly  exposed  to  lower  levels  of  cyanotoxins  in
tap water. There is potential for higher-level exposures because many HABs go un-
detected;  many  do  not  produce  taste  and  odor  compounds  or  form  surface  scums.
The  potential  for  cyanotoxin  exposure  through  drinking  water  is  high  because  two-
thirds  of  the  U.S.  population’s  tap  water  now  comes  from  surface-water  sources.
Cyanotoxins in potable and recreational waters have caused acute human-health ef-
fects in the U.S. and many other countries.

HAB toxins pose serious risks for human health, as well as the health of domestic
and wild animals. The health effects are generally placed in one of three categories.
Acute health effects. Swallowing  a  mouth  full  of  contaminated  water  could  cause
serious injury or death due to respiratory arrest or organ failure. Lower level expo-
sures  cause  a  multi-system,  flu-like  illness.  Every  year  there  are  multiple  reports
of  animal  deaths  in  the  U.S.  due  to  cyanotoxin  exposure.  Some  states  have  HAB
surveillance  systems  based  on  telephone  hotlines  for  reporting  animal  deaths  after
water  body  contact.  Occasionally  there  are  reports  of  human  deaths.  For  example,
boys  from  a  high  school  soccer  team  swam  in  a  golf  course  pond  after  practice  in
Wisconsin  during  the  summer  of  2002.  Two  of  the  boys  were  horsing  around,
dunking each other under the water. They soon developed gastro-intestinal distress
and then seizures. One boy died from respiratory arrest. Luckily, the other boy sur-
vived. Anabaena were found in stool samples taken from both boys. The coroner at-
tributed the cause of death to anatoxins. The boys swallowed the ‘‘cobra venom.’’

Our book (1), mentioned earlier, has a chapter describing the Nebraska experience
with  HABs.  State  officials  first  noticed  HABs  in  their  surface  waters  during  the
summer of 2004. They determined that the HABs were predominated by Microcystis
species.  The  state  implemented  a  monitoring  program  for  microcystins  in  surface
waters,  and  developed  action  levels  based  on  WHO  guidelines  for  increased  moni-
toring  and  closure.  Over  700  samples  were  taken  from  111  different  surface  water
bodies  during  2004.  Sixty-nine  health  advisories  (increased  monitoring)  and  26
health alerts (lake closures) were issued in 2004. Some closures lasted for more than
three months. The great benefit to public health provided by the Nebraska HAB ac-
tion plan became evident when a mistake was made in 2004. Toxin levels exceeding
the  health  alert  level  for  lake  closure  were  observed  in  the  popular  recreational
lake,  Pawnee  Lake,  on  a  Friday.  Officials  were  instructed  to  post  signs  at  lake
beaches  notifying  the  public  that  the  lake  was  closed  due  to  cyanotoxins.  However,
only  one  beach  was  posted.  The  public  used  other  beaches  and  the  rest  of  the  lake
that  weekend.  The  state  received  over  50  reports  the  following  week  of  severe
gastro-intestinal  and  flu-like  illness  in  people  that  recreated  on  Pawnee  Lake  the
previous  weekend.  The  actual  number  of  poisonings  may  have  been  much  higher.
It  is  believed  that  most  physicians  do  not  recognize  illnesses  as  being  caused  by
cyanotoxins.
Chronic  health  effects.  Most  non-lethal  cases  of  acute  cyanotoxin  poisoning  re-
cover within days or weeks. However, an unknown percentage of susceptible individ-
uals continue to suffer neurological and other symptoms for many months or years.
Although  few  studies  have  investigated  chronic  illness  caused  by  algal  toxins,  the
phenomenon  is  best  described  in  the  literature  on  chronic  Ciguatera-seafood  poi-
soning.  It  is  estimated  that  a  1,000,000  people  worldwide  may  contract  Ciguatera-
seafood  poisoning  yearly  due  to  the  consumption  of  reef  fish  contaminated  with
ciguatoxins.  The  U.S.  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  estimates
that  only  two  to  ten  percent  of  Ciguatera-seafood  poisoning  cases  in  the  U.S.  are

recognized or reported. Approximately 20 percent of acute illness cases are thought
to  develop  a  chronic  condition  characterized  by  extreme  fatigue,  weakness,  muscle
pain, sensory abnormalities, and cognitive deficits. The scientific literature contains
reports of chronic illness following acute exposure or repeated, low-level exposure to
cyanotoxins, although scientific studies of the condition are lacking.

Last  month  I  reported  a  study  of  chronic  illness  in  cyanotoxin-exposed  patients
at  a  medical  conference  in  Costa  Rica.  My  research  colleague,  Ritchie  Shoemaker,
MD,  who  specializes  in  biotoxin-associated  illness,  collected  the  data.  The  17  pa-
tients  had  residential  and/or  recreational  exposure  to  freshwater  bodies  that  regu-
larly  experienced  HABs  predominated  by  Microcystis.  The  average  duration  of  ill-
ness  was  about  two  years.  Most  patients  previously  consulted  numerous  physicians
and  received  numerous  diagnoses,  none  of  which  involved  toxins.  The  patients  dis-
played  statistically  significant  and  severe  deficits  in  vision,  multiple-system  symp-
toms, and biochemical abnormalities, relative to control study participants. The bio-
chemical  abnormalities  indicated  exposure  triggered  an  inflammatory  process.  Ill-

Cholestyramine  is  a  non-absorbable  polymer  that  binds  many  toxins,  cholesterol,
and salts from bile in the intestines, causing them to be eliminated rather than re-
absorbed  during  enterohepatic  recirculation.  These  and  other  data  indicate  that
there may be many unrecognized cases of chronic illness in the U.S. and world wide
that are caused by algal and other biotoxins.
Delayed health effects. Little is known about the effects of repeated, low-level ex-
posures, but cancer and neurodegeneration are outcomes implicated in the scientific
literature.  For  example,  laboratory  studies  indicate  that  microcystins  are  a  cause
and promoter of liver, colon and other cancers. Microcystin levels in drinking water
were  associated  with  liver  cancer  incidence  in  Chinese  epidemiological  studies.
Other  studies  indicate  that  cylindrospermopsin  and  other  cyanotoxins  also  may  be
carcinogenic.

symptoms  dissipated  during 

The  results  from  decades  of  studying  a  neurodegenerative  complex  common
among  natives  of  Guam  recently  spurred  research  on  Alzheimer’s  disease  and  the
cyanotoxin,  (β-Methyl  Amino  Alanine  (BMAA).  Scientists  reported  a  high  incidence
of  a  neurologic  condition  with  aspects  of  Parkinsonism,  Alzheimer’s  disease  and
Amyotrophic  Lateral  Sclerosis  among  the  Chamorro  population  of  Guam  in  the
1940s.  The  leading  causative  agent  is  now  thought  to  be  BMAA.  The  cyanobacteria
genus Nostoc grows on the roots of the cycad plant and produces BMAA. BMAA ac-
cumulates  in  the  seeds  of  the  cycad.  A  species  of  flying  fox  feeds  on  the  seeds  and
accumulates high levels of BMAA in its tissues. The flying fox was a traditional food
of  the  Chamorro.  Autopsy  studies  showed  BMAA  in  case,  but  not  control,  brains.
As the flying fox population decreased to near-extinction levels, the incidence of the
Guam dementia complex decreased dramatically. Recent research produced two im-
portant results. First, BMAA is produced by most or all genera of cyanobacteria, and
is  often  present  in  surface  waters.  Second,  BMAA  was  observed  in  Canadian  Alz-
heimer  brains,  but  not  in  control  brains.  Evidence  to  date  for  a  causative  relation-
ship between BMAA and Alzheimer’s is far from conclusive, but the potential rami-
fications  are  enormous.  Current  studies  continue  to  investigate  the  Alzheimer’s-
BMAA relationship, while others investigate cancer and cyanotoxin linkages.
Ecosystem effects. HABs adversely impact many trophic levels of aquatic environ-
ments  through  a  variety  of  mechanisms  during  bloom  formation  and  collapse.  As
blooms form, the increased biomass of the cells reduces water transparency. Result-
ing light limitations inhibit the growth of plants, epiphyton, benthic algae and other
phytoplankton.  Water  alkalinity  increases  as  the  expanding  biomass  consumes  car-
bon dioxide, altering phytoplanktonic interactions and causing lethal and sub-lethal
impacts on fish populations. Cyanotoxins augment and expand these effects as fish,
zooplankton,  macro-invertebrates,  wading  birds  and  aquatic  vertebrates  suffer  fur-
ther  lethal  and  sub-lethal  effects.  For  example,  data  from  Florida  show  strong  cor-
relations  between  Cylindrospermopsis  and  cylindrospermopsin  concentrations  and
alligator death rates. Another example is a new syndrome among wading birds such
as coots. The new syndrome, termed avian vacuole myelopathy, was first discovered
in the U.S. southeast during the mid-1990s. After feeding on plants such as hydrilla
in lakes, birds were observed to swim and fly erratically before dying. Autopsies re-
vealed vacuoles or holes in brain and spinal cord nervous tissues. The cause of death
is  believed  to  be  an  as  yet  unidentified  toxin  produced  by  a  newly  discovered
cyanobacterium  in  the  order  of  stigonematales  that  colonized  aquatic  plants.  The
lethality extended to predatory birds such as bald eagles as they easily captured and
consumed the impaired wading birds.

Bloom  collapses  often  are  associated  with  massive  fish  mortality.  HABs  can  com-
pletely infest smaller lakes, reservoirs, ponds and long stretches of slow moving riv-

ers. Cell densities can soar, creating think mats of organic material that completely
block  out  light.  Eventually,  cold  weather  or  other  natural  causes  lead  to  a  gradual
collapse of the blooms. The cells are lysed, release all of their toxins into the water
column,  and  sink  to  the  bottom.  Bacterial  and  other  aerobic  processes  deplete  oxy-
gen  in  the  water  column  as  the  cells  are  decomposed.  At  first  bottom  waters,  and
then  upper  levels  of  the  water  column,  become  hypoxic  (no  oxygen)  or  anoxic  (low
oxygen).  Fish  that  are  unable  to  escape  to  oxygenated  waters  die,  often  in  massive
quantities.  The  decomposition  of  cells  and  fish  trigger  a  vicious  cycle.  The  lack  of
oxygen  at  the  sediment-water  interface  causes  chemical  bonds  to  be  broken,  releas-
ing  nutrients  (e.g.,  phosphorus)  and  toxic,  noxious  gasses  (e.g.,  hydrogen  sulfide)
from  the  sediment  to  the  water  column.  Because  phosphorus  is  often  a  limiting
agent for bloom formation, the release of this and other nutrients sets the stage for
new  bloom  formations.  Repeated  bloom  cycles  may  irrevocably  alter  aquatic  eco-
systems,  extinguishing  biota  that  contribute  to  healthy  ecosystems,  while  creating
conditions for continued bloom dominance.

Occurrence, causes and costs of freshwater HABs
HAB  occurrence.  There  is  widespread  agreement  among  scientists,  water  man-
agers,  local  officials,  and  much  of  the  general  public  that  the  occurrence  of  fresh-
water HABs is rapidly increasing in the U.S. and worldwide. Every year freshwater
HABs occur where they previously have not been observed. HABs are lasting longer
than  before.  Freshwater  HABs  occur  in  all  parts  of  North  America,  and  durations
range  from  the  summer  months  in  more  northern  areas  to  year  round  in  more
southern  areas.  HABs  may  be  readily  visible  due  to  the  presence  of  surface  scums,
or  difficult  to  detect  because  some  types  bloom  only  at  mid-level  depths.  Although
there  are  no  national  databases  on  freshwater  HAB  occurrence,  and  only  a  few
State or local databases, the evidence for increasing spatial and temporal occurrence
of freshwater HABs is undeniable.
HAB  causes.  Freshwater  HAB  incidence  and  duration  is  increasing  because  of  in-
creasing  nutrient  input  into  our  water  bodies,  and  rising  temperatures.  Climate
change is driving much of the increase. Average temperatures on land and in water
are  increasing,  an  advantage  for  HAB  organisms  over  many  types  of  beneficial
algae.  The  frequency  of  storms,  heavy  rainfalls  and  flooding  is  increasing,  causing
more  nutrients  to  be  washed  into  our  water  bodies.  Somewhat  ironically,  the  fre-
quency of droughts is increasing at the same time. Slow-moving or stagnant waters
favor  HABs  over  beneficial  algae.  Warm,  quiescent,  and  nutrient  enriched  waters
provide the ideal setting for freshwater HABs.

There  are  four  primary  requirements  for  HAB  occurrence—nutrients,  warmth,
sunlight and calm water. HAB cells thrive and multiply only when sufficient nutri-
ents  are  available.  Cyanobacteria  and  other  algae  require  carbon,  nitrogen,  phos-
phorus  and  some  trace  elements  to  grow.  Carbon  is  not  a  limiting  factor;  there  is
plenty  of  carbon  in  the  air  and  water  for  algal  growth.  In  fact,  some  strategies  for
promoting  the  expansion  of  beneficial  algae  have  been  discussed  as  a  means  of  re-
moving carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, from the air. Nitrogen is a limiting factor
for  only  some  types  of  HAB  cells.  When  usable  forms  of  nitrogen  are  low,  types  of
cyanobacteria that can ‘‘fix’’ nitrogen into usable forms dominate HABs. Phosphorus
is  a  limiting  factor  for  all  types  of  HAB  cells.  Phosphorus  enrichment  of  our  water
bodies  is  driving  much  of  the  increase  in  HAB  occurrence.  The  ratio  of  nitrogen  to
phosphorus concentrations often determines the types of cells that dominate HABs.
Types  of  cyanobacteria  previously  seen  only  in  tropical  areas  have  become  com-
mon  in  much  of  the  U.S.  in  recent  years.  This  pattern  is  expected  to  continue  as
average temperatures increase. Sunlight is required by cyanobacteria to produce en-
ergy  through  photosynthetic  processes.  Some  of  the  recently  invasive  types  of
cyanobacteria  such  as  Cylindrospermopsis,  and  others  like  Planktothrix,  efficiently
produce energy under low light conditions. These types of cyanobacteria often bloom
deep in the water column, making them difficult to detect from the surface.

Freshwater  HABs  occur  almost  exclusively  in  quiescent,  stagnant  waters.  Water
flow rates decrease as an expanding population, agriculture, and industry withdraw
larger  quantities  for  use.  Aquifer  depletion  forces  increased  withdrawal  of  surface
waters  and  damming  to  create  new  reservoirs.  These  factors  and  droughts  are  de-
creasing flow rates and increasing the incidence of freshwater HABs.
HAB  costs.  Although  a  formal  analysis  of  the  total  costs  of  HABs  to  our  economy
has  not  been  conducted,  it  is  known  that  freshwater  HABs  account  for  many  mil-
lions  of  dollars  in  lost  recreational  revenue,  water  treatment  expenditures,  moni-
toring and response activities, health care and aquaculture losses. The development
of  control  and  mitigation  technologies  and  processes  offers  an  opportunity  for  the

U.S. to avoid these losses, and create a world-leading industry. World leadership in
HAB  control  and  mitigation  is  needed  to  sustain  the  Earth’s  aquatic  ecosystems,
protect human health and vitalize the U.S. economy.

Approaches to freshwater HAB control

Of  the  four  causative  factors  for  freshwater  HABs  discussed  above,  only  two  can

reasonably be targeted for HAB control—nutrients and calm water.
Nutrient  input  control.  Nutrient  inputs  enter  freshwater  from  both  point  and
non-point  sources.  Point  sources  include  outlets  from  wastewater  treatment  plants,
urban stormwater collection systems, industries, aquacultures and concentrated ani-
mal-feeding operations. Strategies are needed to reduce the amount of nutrients en-
tering  these  systems  and  exiting  these  systems.  Representatives  Stupak  and  Miller
recently  introduced  a  House  bill  that  would  require  the  EPA  to  order  a  reduction
of phosphorus in detergents to help control HABs in the Great Lakes. Senator Levin
introduced a similar bill.

An ultimate goal should be to recapture and reuse the nutrients in these systems.
For example, phosphorus is not only essential for HABs, but is essential for all liv-
ing organisms and required for agricultural production. There are no synthetic alter-
natives  for  phosphorus  in  fertilizer.  Scientists  around  the  world  warn  that  there  is
a  looming  shortage  of  phosphorus  on  the  horizon.  Phosphorus  production  is  pre-
dicted  to  peak  within  30  years,  and  reserve  depletion  is  predicted  within  50–100
years. Countries such as India already face phosphorus shortages. Ultimately, there
will be no alternative to recapturing and reusing phosphorus.

Non-point source inputs of nutrients to freshwater are much more difficult to con-
trol  than  point  source  inputs.  Nutrients  enter  ditches,  streams,  rivers,  reservoirs,
ponds and lakes when rainwater washes them off of lawns, roads, highways, fields,
pastures  and  forests.  Development  and  expansion  of  watershed  management  plans
and  best  management  practices  for  agriculture,  industry  and  residential  property
are needed to reduce nutrient usage and enable the recapture of nutrients.

There is no question that reduction of nutrient inputs to freshwater benefits water
quality  in  many  ways.  Additionally,  systems  developed  to  reduce  nutrient  inputs
will likely reduce inputs of other pollutants such as pesticides, metals and pharma-
ceutical  products.  However,  HAB  control  through  nutrient-input  reduction  alone  is
a very long-term process. Many years of excessive nutrient input to freshwater bod-
ies has resulted in high concentrations of nutrients in sediments. Nutrients in sedi-
ment  are  released  to  the  water  column  under  hypoxic  and  anoxic  conditions,  and
whenever  storms  or  other  events  stir  up  sediments.  Nutrient  resuspension  often
triggers new HABs. To my knowledge, there is no instance of sustained HAB elimi-
nation  in  a  freshwater  body  of  more  that  100  acres  in  size  through  nutrient-input
reduction alone.

Other approaches to nutrient reduction have proven to be cost prohibitive, ineffec-
tive  over  the  long-term,  detrimental  to  the  environment  or  a  combination  of  these
factors. For example, alum (aluminum sulfate) and other substances have been used
to precipitate phosphorus from the water column to the sediment. However, this ap-
proach has the disadvantages of being effective at HAB prevention only in the short-
term,  detrimental  to  much  of  the  biota  in  aquatic  ecosystems,  cost  prohibitive  over
the long-term, and applicable only to smaller water bodies. Other approaches to nu-
trient reduction, such as hypolimnetic oxygenation, hypolimnetic withdrawal, dredg-
ing  and  biological  manipulations,  also  have  some  combination  of  these  drawbacks.
Calm  water  control.  The  calm  water  requirement  for  HABs  can  be  targeted
through  hydrologic  manipulations.  Although  excess  water  capacity  is  not  usually
available,  increasing  flow  rates  and  decreasing  water  residence  time  eliminates
HABs  even  in  nutrient-rich  freshwaters.  However,  the  overall  outcome  of  increased
flow  sometimes  creates  problems  downstream.  Nutrients  in  freshwater  are  trans-
ported to coastal environments where they stimulate HABs in estuarine and marine
environments.  Another  approach  is  to  destratify  or  artificially  mix  the  entire  water
column. Diffused air system installed in ponds and smaller water bodies frequently
provide good HAB control. Disadvantages include a small area of influence for each
air diffuser, the continual need for electric-grid power, applicability limited to small-
er water bodies due to cost and the vertical transport of nutrients sometimes stimu-
lates  HABs.  The  installation  of  artificial  waterfalls  or  fountains  in  smaller  water
bodies often provides good HAB control with the only drawback being the continual
need for grid power.

I  joined  SolarBee,  Inc.,  because  I  believe  that  they  developed  the  best  techno-
logical  solution  to  freshwater  HABs  in  water  bodies  of  all  sizes.  Two  engineers  in
North Dakota, Joel Bleth and Willard Tormaschy, developed solar powered long-dis-
tance  circulation  (LDC)  technology  as  a  cost-effective  alternative  to  aeration  in

74

wastewater  lagoons.  They  fortuitously  found  that  LDC  not  only  provided  the  bene-
fits  of  aeration  at  a  lower  cost,  but  also  prevented  the  occurrence  of  HABs  in  these
nutrient rich waters. LDC application for HAB control in 250 U.S. freshwater bodies
to date has a success rate of about 95 percent.

LDC  is  created  by  floating  platforms  equipped  with  high-efficiency  pumps  pow-
ered  by  solar  panels  and  a  battery.  The  circulators  operate  24  hours  a  day,  seven
days  a  week,  and  are  designed  for  a  25-year  lifetime  with  little  maintenance.  The
largest  circulator  transports  10,000  gal/min  of  water  from  the  bottom  of  the  photic
zone  to  the  surface,  creating  LDC  sufficient  for  HAB  control  over  an  area  of  about
35 acres. LDC deployment for HAB control is unlike other ‘‘artificial circulation’’ ap-
proaches  to  HAB  control  in  that  it  does  not  destratify  the  water  column  or  aerate
the  hypolimnion.  The  circulator’s  intake  hose  is  set  at  the  base  of  the  photic  zone
for  HAB  control,  usually  just  above  the  thermocline.  A  plate  suspended  below  the
bottom  of  the  intake  hose  causes  near  laminar-flow  intake  of  water  radially  from
long  distances.  The  water  smoothly  departs  from  the  unit  radially,  both  above  and
below  a  disk  positioned  just  under  the  surface.  Only  the  epilimnetic  water  is  cir-
culated,  the  upper  portion  of  the  water  column  in  which  HABs  occur.  The
thermocline  or  density-change  barrier  between  the  epilimnion  and  lower,  nutrient
rich  hypolimnion  remains  intact,  thereby  preventing  those  nutrients  from  entering
the photic zone and further promoting HABs.

Unfortunately,  a  chemical  approach  to  HAB  control  is  commonly  used  today.
Algaecides such as copper sulfate are used to terminate blooms after they form. This
reactive, as opposed to preventive, approach is dangerous for humans and has seri-
ous  detrimental  impacts  in  aquatic  ecosystems.  Copper  sulfate  lyses  HAB  cells,
causing  the  release  of  all  cyanotoxins  to  water  instantaneously.  These  extreme  lev-
els  of  cyanotoxins  in  water  threaten  humans  even  if  they  are  not  directly  in  or  on
the  water.  Recent  CDC  and  other  evidence  indicate  that  HAB  toxins  become  air-
borne  due  to  wind  and  wave  action.  Humans  miles  away  from  the  affected  water
bodies inhale the toxins. The inhaled toxins cause respiratory distress in asthmatic
and  other  susceptible  populations,  and  may  contribute  to  the  chronic  and  delayed
health effects discussed earlier. Copper sulfate itself is toxic to many plants and ani-
mals  living  in  water.  Furthermore,  the  copper  binds  with  many  pollutants  such  as
pesticides, making them more bioavailable and damaging to aquatic organisms. Cop-
per accumulates to high levels in sediment with continued use. As with bacteria re-
sistant  to  antibiotics,  there  is  growing  evidence  that  some  strains  of  cyanobacteria
are  becoming  resistant  to  copper  sulfate  toxicity.  Aquatic  ecosystems  will  not  sur-
vive repeated applications of algaecides over the long-term.
HAB control summary. I believe that the combination of nutrient-input reduction
and  long-distance  circulation  provides  the  best  approach  to  near-  and  long-term
HAB control. This dual approach is sustainable, has no adverse impacts on aquatic
ecosystems,  provides  many  environmental  benefits  in  addition  to  HAB  control,  and
is cost effective over the long-term.

However,  research  is  needed  to  develop  more  efficient  and  effective  strategies  for
controlling  HABs  in  all  water  bodies.  Specific  research  needs  are  detailed  in  the
book  (1),  the  mandated  Freshwater  report  (2),  HARRNESS  (3),  and  the  draft  Man-
agement  and  Response  report  (4).  A  research  plan  that  comprehensively  addresses
HABs  in  all  of  our  nation’s  water  bodies,  coordinates  agency  efforts  and  prevents
duplication of effort can only be established through appropriate federal legislation.
The  need  for  improved  legislation  to  comprehensively  address  HABs  from
freshwater (EPA jurisdiction) to oceans (National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) jurisdiction)

Congress originally passed HABHRCA in 1998 to authorize funds for research on
HABs  and  hypoxia.  This  authority  through  the  Department  of  Commerce  directed
NOAA  to  conduct  research  and  seek  control  of  HABs  and  hypoxia  in  U.S.  oceans,
estuaries and the Great Lakes.

The  2004  reauthorization  of  HABHRCA  expanded  the  Act  to  include  all  fresh-
water bodies. The reauthorization incorporated a reporting requirement by an inter-
agency  task  force  on  freshwater  blooms.  The  book  (1)  I  mentioned  earlier  provided
the  scientific  basis  for  that  report.  The  report,  Scientific  Assessment  of  Freshwater
Harmful  Algal  Blooms,  Interagency  Working  Group  on  Harmful  Algal  Blooms,  Hy-
poxia,  and  Human  Health  (2),  describes  the  environmental,  health  and  economic
consequences of freshwater HABs. HABHRCA also mandated that the task force de-
velop and submit to Congress a plan providing for a comprehensive and coordinated
National  Research  Program  to  develop  and  demonstrate  prevention,  control,  and
mitigation  methods  to  reduce  the  impacts  of  harmful  algae.  That  report,  Harmful
Algal  Bloom  Management  and  Response:  Assessment  and  Plan,  is  in  draft  form  (4).

It  recommends  the  creation  of  a  new  interagency  competitive-grant  program,  the
Mitigation,  Control  and  Prevention  of  Harmful  Algal  Blooms  program  (MACHAB).
Implementation of MACHAB is critical for our nation to develop cost-effective strat-
egies for preventing HABs and mitigating their consequences. My belief in the need
for  a  HAB  control  strategy  is  evidenced  by  my  decision  to  leave  the  EPA  and  shift
my  research  from  human-health  effects  to  HAB  control  technology.  I  believe  it  is
much better to prevent HABs and biotoxin-associated illness than to have people in
need of diagnosis and therapy due to HAB toxin exposures.

I fully support the existing HABHRCA reauthorization bills, including the ‘‘clean’’
reauthorization bill offered by Congressman Connie Mack, and the legislation being
developed  by  Senator  Bill  Nelson  that  addresses  some  of  the  shortcomings  of  the
2004 legislation. I also support the bills to lower phosphorus levels in detergents for
the Great Lakes area. However, these bills do not address the fundamental obstacle
preventing  the  development  of  a  coordinated  National  Research  Plan  for  HABs  in
all of our nation’s waters. Current and proposed legislation does not authorize fund-
ing  for  the  EPA  or  direct  the  Agency  to  ‘‘take  ownership’’  of  the  freshwater  HAB
problem. The current legislation authorizes funding only for NOAA through the De-
partment of Commerce. That Department does not fund the EPA. It is the EPA that
has purview over water quality in inland water bodies through the Clean Water Act
and the Safe Drinking Water Act. As the lead agency with oversight over freshwater
quality,  the  EPA  must  ensure  the  protection  of  ‘‘aquatic  ecosystems  to  protect
human  health,  support  economic  and  recreational  activities,  and  provide  healthy
habitat  for  fish,  plants,  and  wildlife.’’  I  believe  that  the  development  of  a  National
Research  Plan  for  all  freshwater  HABs  is  dependent  on  Congress  passing  a  fresh-
water  act  that  parallels  HABHRCA  but  is  specific  for  the  EPA  and  all  freshwater
bodies.

Convincing  the  EPA  to  accept  oversight  responsibility  for  the  freshwater  HAB
problem may not be an easy task. Since completion of the Freshwater (2) and Man-
agement  and  Response  (4)  reports,  the  EPA  unilaterally  determined  that  its  statu-
tory  requirements  regarding  freshwater  HABs  were  completed.  There  is  no  Agency
effort to develop and implement a National Research Plan for freshwater HABs. The
Agency virtually ceased all participation in freshwater HAB research and mitigation
activities.  Prior  to  that  decision,  the  EPA  annually  contributed  funds  to  one  of  the
two  interagency,  competitive  research  grant  programs  for  HAB  research,  the  Ecol-
ogy and Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms (ECOHAB). The EPA ceased fund-
ing  that  program  this  year.  Scientists  at  the  EPA’s  National  Health  and  Environ-
mental  Effects  Research  Laboratory  were  ordered  to  cease  all  research  on  HABs.
Staff  were  ordered  to  decline  requests  from  the  EPA  regional  offices  and  many
State,  local  and  tribal  organizations  seeking  information  on  the  risks  and  manage-
ment  of  freshwater  HABs.  In  taking  this  position,  the  EPA  has  failed  to  recognize
the  urgency  of  the  freshwater-HAB  problem,  and  that  freshwater  HAB  cells  differ
from  those  that  cause  marine  HABs,  just  as  fresh  and  salt  water  and  their  eco-
systems  differ.  Further,  some  of  the  causes  of  HABs  and  potential  control  tech-
nologies  likely  differ  between  freshwater  and  saltwater  bodies.  The  EPA’s  short-
sightedness  can  substantially  harm  human  health,  the  environment  and  the  econ-
omy. The EPA’s decision to halt HAB research was likely influenced by unclear Con-
gressional  directives,  a  lack  of  budgetary  authority  and  lower  overall  Agency  fund-
ing. It is up to Congress to work with the EPA to correct this situation for the good
of our nation.

All  Agency  officials  did  not  fail  to  adequately  recognize  the  importance  of  fresh-
water  HABs.  The  Agency’s  National  Center  for  Environmental  Research  issued  a
competitive-grant  request  for  proposals  in  2007  on  research  to  develop  sensors  for
HAB cells and toxins. The EPA’s National Center for Environmental Assessment is
attempting to draft toxicological reviews for a few cyanotoxins.

My  recommendation,  and  I  believe  I  am  joined  by  the  vast  majority  of  scientists
in this view, is that statutory requirements are needed to direct the EPA to develop
and  implement  a  National  Research  Plan  for  freshwater  HABs.  Freshwater-
HABHRCA  legislation  that  parallels  the  current  and  proposed  reauthorizations  for
HABHRCA  can  accomplish  this  goal.  Congress  should  pass  Freshwater-HABHRCA
legislation  that  authorizes  funding  for,  and  directs  the  EPA  to  develop  and  imple-
ment,  a  comprehensive  freshwater-HAB  research  program.  This  Act  will  create  a
unified  approach  toward  protection  our  nation  from  the  risks  of  inland  HABs,  just
as  HABHRCA  and  NOAA  have  done  for  HABs  in  oceans,  estuaries  and  the  Great
Lakes.  The  research  should  be  conducted  through  a  strong  extramural,  peer-re-
viewed, competitive-grant program and supplemented through intramural research.
The  Agency  should  be  directed  to  fund  the  existing  interagency  grant  programs,
ECOHAB  and  the  Monitoring  and  Event  Response  for  Harmful  Algal  Blooms
(MERHAB).  The  EPA  should  further  be  directed  to  help  institute  and  fund  the

newly  proposed  MACHAB  interagency  grant  program.  The  extramural  grant  pro-
grams  will  form  partnerships  critical  to  developing  a  successful  National  Program
for  Preventing  HABs.  These  partnerships  should  include  public,  private,  for-profit
and  nonprofit  institutions  and  organizations,  including  states,  local  governments,
tribes,  appropriate  industries  (including  aquatic  technology,  fisheries,  agriculture,
and  fertilizer),  academic  institutions,  and  nongovernmental  organizations  with  ex-
pertise  in  water-quality  science  and  management.  Further,  Congress  must  specifi-
cally authorize and appropriate funds for these freshwater-HAB research programs.
Legislation  will  provide  clarity  to  the  EPA  that  freshwater  HAB  research  is  au-
thorized,  and  that  the  Agency  must  contribute  to  HAB  research  programs  in  order
to  develop  solutions  to  the  freshwater  HAB  problem  through  partnerships.  The
House  Science  and  Technology  Committee  is  an  appropriate  legislative  body  to  de-
velop a new bill for establishing a National Research Program for Freshwater HABs
because  of  its  responsibility  for  the  environment  and  jurisdiction  over  the  EPA.  I
urge  the  Members  of  the  Energy  and  Environment  Subcommittee  to  address  this
issue.

I  am  pleased  to  offer  my  expertise  to  help  develop  authority  for  the  EPA  con-
sistent with NOAA’s existing research and response programs. We must act now as
a unified country to develop policy and interagency coordination to mitigate and con-
trol HABs in all of our nation’s waters. HAB toxins are far more potent than indus-
trial  chemicals,  and  the  environmental  load  of  HAB  toxins  is  increasing  at  an
alarming  rate.  The  potential  consequences  of  increasing  HABs  for  human  health,
aquatic  ecosystem  sustainability  and  our  economy  are  too  great  to  ignore.  Inaction
is not an option that we cannot afford.

I thank the Subcommittee for allowing me to express my views today.

DISCUSSION

HABHRCA REAUTHORIZATION

Chairman LAMPSON. Well, thank you very much and thank all of
you  for  your  testimony.  At  this  point  we  will  begin  our  first  round
of  questioning,  and  the  Chair  will  recognize  himself  for  the  first
five minutes.

Dr. Magnien, before we get into a discussion on how to move for-
ward  on  the  issue,  I  want  to  ask  a  question  about  the  last
HABHRCA  reauthorization  in  2004.  There  were  a  number  of  re-
ports and plans that were supposed to be done within a year or two
of  enactment  and  I  have  only  seen  one  transmitted  to  Congress.
Can you tell me about the status of each of these reports and why
it  is  taking  so  long  to  produce  them?  I  am  referring  specifically  to
the  Research,  Development,  Demonstration  and  Technology  Trans-
fer Plan, the three assessments of harmful algal blooms, the fresh-
water harmful algal blooms and hypoxia.

Dr.  MAGNIEN.  As  you  mentioned,  there  are  four  reports  of  the
2004  authorization.  One  has  been  produced  and  the  three  others
are  essentially  completed.  They  are  just  going  through  the  final
stages  of  review  and  will  be  transmitted  to  Congress  shortly.  Part
of the challenge in putting those together was to fully engage both
the research community, the management community and the fed-
eral agencies in coming to consensus on these reports so I think the
product,  even  though  it  is  a  little  bit  beyond  the  deadline,  is  well
worth  the  extra  effort  and  we  made  all  attempts  to  keep  Congress
informed  throughout  the  process  of  some  of  the  delays  that  were
occurring.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  NOAA  leads  two  important  competitive  re-
search  programs,  the  ECOHAB  and  MERHAB  programs.  These
programs got off to a very good start in funding many projects that
have  contributed  to  the  advancement  of  knowledge  and  manage-
ment  capabilities  that  we  have  now.  Are  there  any  new  solicita-
tions for these programs to continue these efforts?

Dr.  MAGNIEN.  We  had  a  competition  in  this  fiscal  year  for  the
ECOHAB  program.  We  alternate  between  years  between  the
ECOHAB  and  the  MERHAB  program.  Unfortunately,  our  funding
availability  this  year  would  not  allow  us  to  start  any  new  awards
for the 2008 competition, although we did provide funding for some
of the multi-year awards for past competitions.

HARRNESS

Chairman LAMPSON. Thanks.
Dr.  Anderson,  you  mentioned  that  the  current  national  plan  is
outdated. Now we have the new plan, HARRNESS, to help address
this  issue  for  the  next  decade  or  more.  What  specific  components
of  this  plan  should  be  incorporated  into  the  new  HABHRCA  reau-
thorization?

Dr.  ANDERSON.  Mr.  Chairman,  you  have  heard  us  mention  sev-
eral  possible  programs.  One  that  keeps  coming  up  is  this  RDDTT,
or  a  better  way  to  think  of  it  perhaps  is  prevention,  control  and
mitigation  of  HABs.  The  way  that  report  has  been  written,  and  I
have  appended  the  Executive  Summary  of  that  report  to  my  writ-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:32 Dec 26, 2008 Jkt 043278 PO 00000 Frm 00112 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\071008\43278 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

ten  testimony,  it  has  three  components  to  it.  One  is  an  actual  re-
search  and  demonstration  program  on  Prevention,  Control,  and
Mitigation strategies, but then there is also an Event Response ele-
ment and then an Infrastructure element. Without going into great
details, each of those is needed because we need programs that will
help us test and demonstrate mitigation and control strategies and
practical science, bringing science through to practical applications.
But  we  also  need  to  help  the  states  and  the  regions  respond  with
these  massive  outbreaks  and  unexpected  outbreaks,  so  an  Event
Response  element  is  needed.  And  then  we  also  need  what  we  are
calling  infrastructure,  which  means  toxin  standards  for  all  the
measurements  that  are  needed  and  culture  collections  and  many,
many  other  things  that  we  need  to  conduct  our  research—infra-
structure that everybody shares. That is an infrastructure element.
So  we  put  all  of  this  under  this  RDDTT  umbrella.  So  that  is  one
program  that  I  think  really  is  needed  and,  as  I  said,  it  needs  to
be  separate  from—and  shouldn’t  steal  funds  or  shouldn’t  take
funds  away  from  the  basic  research  that  is  already  there  with
ECOHAB and MERHAB.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  What  are  the  major  research  gaps  and  ob-
stacles? And I guess you spoke about some of that, that make pre-
dicting  the  occurrences  of  the  harmful  algal  blooms  difficult,  and
are  there  other  technologies  that  we  could  be  using  to  help  make
better predictions?

OBSTACLES IN PREDICTING HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS

Dr. ANDERSON. One of the—I will use my own region as a perfect
example.  We  have  developed  what  is  probably  one  of  the  best  nu-
merical  models  in  the  world  for  harmful  algal  blooms  and  it  is  the
one  that  allowed  us  to  make  predictions  and  give  forecasts  for  our
managers, but at the same time it is restricted by our ability to col-
lect  data  during  these  outbreaks.  You  get  very  good  weather  fore-
casts  because  there  is  a  continual  flow  of  data  from  sensors  and
weather  stations  everywhere  that  is  being  used  to  constantly  up-
date  your  weather  models.  We  don’t  have  that  in  our  system,  so
what  we  need  is  one  answer  to  your  question.  The  ocean  observ-
atory  system  is  starting  to  instrument  the  coastal  ocean.  What  we
need are instruments as part of that system that will detect HABs
and  their  toxins  and  relay  that  information  to  us  so  that  we  can
assimilate  it  into  our  models  and  improve  those  forecasts  and  the
predictions. To me, that is a very, very important step forward.

Chairman LAMPSON. Can we do it with satellites?
Dr.  ANDERSON.  Satellites  will  only  work  in  some  parts  of  the
country  with  certain  HABs,  like  in  Florida.  There,  satellites  work
very  well  in  the  predictive  system  that  Dr.  Rob  Magnien  men-
tioned.  In  the  Northeast,  for  example,  or  in  the  Northwest,  our
blooms  are  never  dense  enough  or  are  rarely  dense  enough  to  be
visible  from  space,  so  satellites  are  only  useful  in  some  locations.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Mr.  Ayres,  Dr.  Hudnell,  would  you  all  like

to comment on that?

Dr. HUDNELL. I definitely support what Dr. Anderson said. There
is  a  great  need  to  give  a  window  of  opportunity  to  risk  managers
to  take  action  before  harm  is  done,  and  the  better  we  can  develop
models  like  Dr.  Anderson  has  to  predict  when  these  events  will

110

occur,  the  better  we  can  protect  the  public  health  from  these  very
potent toxins.

Mr.  AYRES.  The  other  thing  I  might  add  is,  I  did  spend  some
time  working  on  the  event  response  portion  of  the  RDT  workshop
report, RDDTT, however that goes, and event response really is im-
portant  to  State  managers  and  the  ability  to  share  resources  be-
tween  states  and  be  able  to  have  federal  experts  come  quickly  to
the  aid  of  states  in  the  event  of  these  blooms  that  occur  quite
quickly is terribly important to State managers like myself around
the Nation.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Mr.  Inglis,  you  are  recognized  for  five  min-

utes.

SATELLITE CAPACITY

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr. Magnien, I understand that there is some question about the
capacities  of  the  NPOESS  satellite  to  see  as  well  or  get  images  as
good  as  we  are  getting  now.  Is  that  your  understanding  as  well?
Dr.  MAGNIEN.  Well,  I  am  afraid  I  am  not  a  satellite  expert  so  I
really wouldn’t be able to comment on the specifics of that satellite
technology  but  I  would  be  happy  to  provide  that  information  fol-
lowing the hearing.

Mr.  INGLIS.  That  would  be  helpful,  because  it  is  of  concern  if
NPOESS isn’t going to get us as good of pictures as we are getting
now, and does anybody else have anything to say about that or any
information about that?

Dr.  ANDERSON.  I  can’t  comment  specifically  other  than  I  have
been  to  several  meetings  where  the  members  of  our  community
who  do  work  with  remote  sensing  information  have  spoken  very
strongly  about  the  need  for  some  strong  guidance  to  the  govern-
ment  to  improve  the  next  missions  that  go  out,  the  instruments
that  are  going  into  space  because  we  are  reliant,  as  I  understand
it, on an Indian satellite that will be coming up that we don’t even
know will have the correct wavelength, the correct information that
we have been getting or satellites that are already beyond their de-
sign  life,  and  so  the  next  five  or  ten  years  is  sort  of  a  black  hole
for  some  of  these  sensors  up  in  space  and  I  have  heard  that  there
is  a  genuine  concern  and  that  is  perhaps  what  you  are  also  refer-
ring to.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  speaking  of  images,  Dr.  Anderson,  I  think  it  is
you  that  had  the  particularly,  as  you  said,  dramatic  images  from
China. Is that—is what is going on there typical as to what we see
elsewhere or is this particularly unusual amount of growth?

Dr. ANDERSON. They truly are dramatic images. The answer real-
ly is that in some parts of the world, that is, I won’t call it typical,
but  in  many  developing  parts  of  the  world  where  there  is  a  strong
input  of  pollutants  into  coastal  waters,  this  is  the  type  of  event
that you can see. China has unfortunately over many years focused
a  lot  of  energy  on  feeding  its  population,  on  agriculture  and  aqua-
culture  in  the  coastal  zone,  and  you  are  now  seeing  the  effects  of
that.  There  is  no  question  that  those  seaweed  blooms  are  being
driven by pollution, much heavier pollution than we typically have
in  this  country,  so  we  don’t  see  some  of  those  types  of  events  in
that extreme, but down in Florida, for example, there are seaweeds

washing  up  on  beaches  and  rotting  and  decaying  and  that  occurs
up  in  the  New  England  area  as  well.  It  just  is  not  quite  as  exten-
sive as in China.

ALGAE BLOOMS FOR BIODIESEL

Mr. INGLIS. This may be a question better directed to the Chair-
man  because  I  think  he  has  had  some  business  experience  with
this,  but  we  could  learn  something  from  these  rapid  algae  blooms
in  using  CO2 to  grow  this  algae  into  biodiesel,  right?  It  is  sort  of
a  two-for.  I  should  recognize  the  Chairman  to  speak  on  that.  It  is
sort of a two-for to figure how to prevent it from happening in the
ocean  but  maybe  have  it  happen,  rapid  growth,  where  we  want  it
so we can harvest that material, right?

Dr.  ANDERSON.  I  will  offer  a  comment  there.  We  all  get  com-
ments  and  questions  these  days  from  industry  and  so  forth  about
exactly that. Couldn’t we harvest these blooms and turn them into
biofuel?  The  answer  is  that  the  economics  aren’t  really  there  for
most  of  them,  especially  given  that  not  all  of  these  blooms  are  as
spectacular  as  some  of  the  pictures  you  are  seeing,  and  you  need
to have a sustainable, continuous resource. But there is no question
that if you move this whole process on land and develop the ability
to grow these mass quantities of algae, they are a much better ap-
proach  to  biofuel  than  growing  corn  and  going  the  ethanol  route.
You can grow algae in desert locations. There are many, many ad-
vantages to using algae for biofuel but I don’t think one can do that
with  natural  blooms.  I  think  they  are  too  sporadic  and  in  many
cases  actually  the  harm  we  get  is  from  very  dilute  suspensions  of
cells that would not be suitable for biofuel.

Mr. INGLIS. My time is up, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  was  wondering  if  we  couldn’t  create  some
giant  vacuum  cleaner  and  suck  all  this  stuff  up  and  filter  out  the
algae,  squeeze  the  oil  out  of  it  and  make  fuel.  Apparently  that  is
not the best idea in the world.

Mr. Baird, you are recognized for five minutes.

REDUCING AND CONTROLLING ALGAL BLOOMS

Mr.  BAIRD.  I  thank  the  chairman  and  thank  our  witnesses.  This
is  indeed  an  important  topic,  as  mentioned  earlier  by  my  col-
leagues. It affects not only our Puget Sound and our offshore envi-
ronment  and  also  Vancouver  Lake  right  near  my  own  home.  One
of the interesting things, Mr. Chairman, about the amnesic form of
this  is  how  it  functions,  and  it  would  scare  the  willies  out  of  you
if  you  understand  it.  It  attacks  the  hippocampus.  I  am  a
neuropsychologist  by  training  and  the  hippocampus  is  a  structure
of  the  brain  that  is  responsible  for  basically  transforming  current
experience  in  the  long-term  memories,  and  when  the  hippocampus
is  bilaterally  lesioned,  you  get  a  phenomenon  wherein  you  have
your  old-term  memory,  long-term  memory,  but  nothing  gets  in,  so
if  we  left  the  room  and  came  back  a  couple  minutes  later,  you
would  not  remember  that  we  had  seen  one  another.  Sometimes
Congress  seems  to  have  suffered  from  this.  But  it  is  really  quite
astonishing  and  highlights  the  seriousness  of  this.  You  know,  it  is
not  just  about  closing  our  shellfish  industry.  It  is  about  a  perma-

112

nent,  severe  neurological  impairment  that  results  and  that  is  why
this topic is so important.

I  would  caution,  by  the  way,  the  notion  of  commercial  algal  use
for  petroleum  production.  There  was  just  an  article  in  Science,  I
think last week, about a reef structure in India that has been dev-
astated by the release of algae apparently used for commercial pro-
duction purposes and is just flooding over this reef, and you should
see the pictures. It has been wiped out.

But  I  want  to  get  to  the  question  of  what  do  we  do  about  these
things.  I  think  you  have  talked  about  the  monitoring.  It  sounded
like,  Dr.  Hudnell,  that  there  are  some  approaches  to  actually  re-
duce—I  mean,  once  you  have  got  a  bloom,  these  things  are  pretty
intractable.  Are  there—what  do  we  know  about  how  to  get  rid  of
them  once  they  are  there,  especially  in  relatively  small  closed
water environments? I know a big bloom off a coast might be hard
but what are the spectrum of opportunities for this?

Dr.  HUDNELL.  Yes.  Well,  speaking  for  cyanobacteria  in  fresh-
water blooms and somewhat it pertains to the red tides also, there
are four requirements for blooms. They need nutrients, particularly
phosphorus and nitrogen as well as trace elements. They need sun-
light for photosynthesis. They need warmth. Many of these develop
in  warmer  areas  south  and  then  move  north  as  temperatures  in-
crease. And they need quiescent, stagnant water. So when you are
talking about solutions for control, you look at the causes. You can
do  something  about  nutrients.  You  can  reduce  nutrient  input  into
our  water.  We  need  to  do  that  for  many  reasons,  not  only  because
of  HABs  and  water  quality.  We  need  to  reduce  nutrient  input  be-
cause phosphorus, we are predicted to peak production in 30 years,
and be out of natural sources of phosphorus in 50 to 100 years. We
need  to  be  recapturing  and  reusing  these  nutrients  instead  of  let
them  run  into  the  water  and  cause  problems.  We  can’t  do  much
about  warmth  and  sunlight  but  we  can  do  something  about  quies-
cent, stagnant water. Unfortunately, we can’t usually just open the
floodgates and let a lot of water rush out because of increasing de-
mand  and  droughts,  but  we  can  circulate  the  water.  That  is  why
I  went  to  work  for  SolarBee  because  they  made  floating  platforms
that  are  solar-powered  with  a  battery  and  high-efficiency  pumps.
You  put  a  big  hose  down.  You  drawn  in  water  horizontally  from
long  distances.  Water  is  in  different  density  layers  so  you  draw  in
from  one  layer  long  distances,  bring  it  up  at  10,000  gallons  per
minute  and  push  it  out  smoothly  on  the  surface  to  circulate  the
water  over  a  35-acre  area,  and  it  is  strong  enough  circulation  to
prevent  these  HABs  over  a  35-acre  area  per  unit.  So  the  effect  is
additive. The more units you put in, the more area you can protect.
For example, now we have about 20-some circulators protecting the
water intake in Houston in their reservoir, which has had bad HAB
problems.

And  so  I  think  that  we  should  combine  our  efforts  to  do  two
things:  control  nutrient  input  to  water  through  best  management
practices,  reduce  the  amount  of  nutrients  we  use.  For  example,
there are bills now to take phosphate out of detergents. We should
do  some  of  that.  Find  other  ways  to  use  only  what  we  really  need,
not just throw all the fertilizer out and you think the more, the bet-
ter.  And  we  need  to  recapture  the  nutrients  at  the  point  sources

where they come out of the pipes into the water. There can be sys-
tems  there  that  precipitate  out  the  phosphorus  before  it  goes  into
the  freshwaters,  so  we  can  take  it  and  reuse  it.  And  we  need  to
combine the approach of nutrient input reduction with the circula-
tion  of  water  where  there  is  no  other  means  for  it  to  be  anything
other than quiescent and stagnant. We need to keep it moving, and
we are doing research now to figure out why that works. We know
it  works  but  we  haven’t  done  the  research  yet  to  figure  out  how  it
works. So that is my approach to HAB prevention and control.

Dr.  ANDERSON.  To  bring  us  to  the  marine  side  of  that  story,  we
do  have  a  number  of  technologies  that  we  are  looking  into.  Some
of them are very simple. In Korea and other countries in Asia, they
spray  clay  over  the  ocean,  and  it  flocculates.  It  makes  large  par-
ticles  that  carry  these  red  tide  cells  to  the  bottom  and  they  have
effectively  protected  their  fish-farming  industry  with  a  modest  in-
vestment  compared  to  the  value  of  that  industry.  Interestingly,
though, and my lab has actually been doing work on that, we have
encountered  quite  a  bit  of  environmental  opposition  to  this  as  you
might  understand.  But  at  the  same  time,  it  is  rather  frustrating
from  my  standpoint  because  we  do  everything  I  think  we  need  to
do  to  demonstrate  that  this  is  much  less  damaging  that  the  red
tide itself and that clay flows into the ocean constantly from rivers
and  rainfall  and  yet  there  are  groups  that  oppose  it.  And  so  what
is happening is, we are developing certain technologies, and I could
mention  viruses  and  parasites  and  bacteria  that  will  all  destroy
these  red  tide  cells,  but  there  is  a  social  issue  that  we  need  to  ad-
dress  and  to  get  society  to  accept  this  in  the  ocean  is  going  to  be
a big step. We already accept spraying for mosquitoes, spraying for
pests on broccoli or corn or whatever, but people are not yet ready
to let us do the same in the ocean, and I think this is an important
issue  to  be  addressed.  It  is  an  important  area  for  invasive  species
as well and it is one that I think we can approach, and that is one
of the reasons that I think we need this separate RDDTT program
because  when  I  write  a  proposal  that  tries  to  get  funding  for  clay
work and it is competing against basic science proposals from other
investigators,  guess  which  ones  tend  to  get  supported?  Because
mine  is  much  more  controversial,  some  reviewers  say  it  is  never
going  to  work,  it  is  going  to  cause  all  these  problems,  and  so  you
need to have a separate pool of money where engineers and every-
one  else  comes  in  and  starts  to  attack  these  problems  while  the
basic research keeps moving on a separate track.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  know  my  time  is  up  but  I  would  be
very interested in following up with you on that, Dr. Anderson. We
have seen this with invasives in my own district where an invasive
species threatened to wipe out a marine estuary, just was going to
destroy it, turn it into a prairie from an estuary, and the fight was
to get herbicide labeled so that we could kill, it was Spartena grass,
and we almost lost the estuary. We are beating it now in a remark-
able success story but we need at some point to gauge the cost-ben-
efits in a better way and just saying under no circumstances inter-
vene  when  the  condition  that  you  are  trying  to  beat  may  be  far
more  destructive  than  the  intervention  and  finding  a  way  to  deal
with  that  would  be  very  helpful.  Maybe  we  could  pursue  this  in
this committee. Thanks, Dr. Anderson.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Baird.
Mr. McNerney, you are recognized for five minutes.

CLIMATE CHANGE’S IMPACT ON ALGAL BLOOMS

Mr. MCNERNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  think  I  am  going  to  say  the  same  thing  that  Mr.  Baird  said.
This is a fascinating subject, and I don’t know that much about it,
so thank you for coming and testifying.

Dr.  Anderson,  could  you  outline  briefly  or  in  detail,  if  you  wish,
what you think the impact of climate change and specifically ocean
acidification would be on HABs?

Dr.  ANDERSON.  I  will  take  the  marine  side  of  that  and  I  think
Dr.  Hudnell  will  probably  have  some  comments  to  add  about  the
freshwater  side.  We  get  asked  that  question  a  lot  and  it  is  a  very
difficult one to answer because HABs are very complex phenomena.
In  my  own  region,  again  I  will  use  that  as  an  example,  we  now
have computer models for future climate scenarios that would say,
for  example,  we  will  have  more  rainfall  and  warmer  temperatures
and things like this. We can start to put those predictions into our
models  to  ask  what  that  might  do  to  our  blooms.  But  these  orga-
nisms are very adaptive. As I said, they have a cyst stage that re-
mains  in  the  sediment.  It  is  a  lot  like  a  seed  of  a  higher  plant.  So
if the winter is shorter, it just means the cyst will germinate a lit-
tle  bit  earlier  and  if  it  is  a  hotter  summer,  it  may  end  its  bloom
sooner.  So  it  is  very  hard  to  say  how  much  difference  that  would
make.  But  I  think  in  general,  we  could  say  that  we  are  going  to
see  a  movement  of  these  HAB  problems  from  some  areas  where
they occur now into other areas where they don’t just because tem-
peratures become more tolerant. But on the other hand, you might
actually see the disappearance of some species from some areas as
the temperatures become too warm, for example. Acidification is an
issue that I don’t have any specific answer for, given all of our dif-
ferent HAB organisms. There are so many different kinds that each
one  would  have  to  be  studied  separately,  and  that  research  is  just
beginning.  I  think  on  the  freshwater  side  of  the  picture  though,  it
is  a  little  more  clear  that  with  the  warming  temperatures  and  the
changes  of  stratification  and  pH,  that  one  would  see  more
cyanobacterial blooms.

Dr.  HUDNELL.  I  believe  that  climate  change  is  having  an  impact
on this and will continue to do so. First of all, the issue of increas-
ing temperatures. We are seeing organisms that used to only occur
south of the United States occurring in the United States now, and
spreading  rapidly,  for  example,  Cylindorspermopsis  makes  highly
potent  cylindorspermopsin  toxins  that  affect  multiple  organ  sys-
tems,  stop  protein  production.  This  is  occurring  in  many  places  in
this  country  now  and  expanding  because  it  is  getting  the  warmth
that  it  needs.  But  on  top  of  temperature,  the  precipitation  and
storms  is  another  issue.  It  is  sort  of  ironic  that  with  climate
change, it seems that you get on the one hand more frequent heavy
storms,  and  what  this  does  is  wash  off  more  nutrients  into  our
freshwater. But on the other hand, you also get more frequent and
extended  drought  periods,  and  so  when  you  get  droughts,  you  get
slower water flow, more quiescent stagnant water, so both of these

factors tend to increase the occurrence of these freshwater harmful
algal blooms.

PREDICTING ALGAL BLOOMS

Mr. MCNERNEY. Thank you.
Dr.  Magnien,  you  went  over  the  predictions  of  the  New  England
event. How effective would that modeling be in terms of other types
of these events around other coastlines, other sections of our coast-
line?

Dr.  MAGNIEN.  Well,  that  is  a  good  question  because  it  speaks  to
the  national  scope  of  our  programs  as  well  as  tailoring  things  re-
gionally,  so  there  definitely  are  components  of  all  of  these  types  of
research whether it is a forecast or detection or a control issue with
a  virus  or  a  bacteria  clay  that  is  transferable  from  one  region  to
another,  so  the  knowledge  that  we  have  developed  through  our
partners  in  New  England  can  definitely  be  transferred  elsewhere,
not  necessarily  lock,  stock  and  barrel  but  with  adjustments  to  the
particular HAB species or the circulation patterns in a given region
with  much  less  effort  and  shorter  time  frames.  So  we  are  looking
at  all  of  those  opportunities  to  get  efficiencies  and  transfer  knowl-
edge from one region to another and we have already got a number
of very good examples where that has been done.

Mr. MCNERNEY. So do you find coordination between agencies or
scientists  to  be  at  a  beneficial  state  now  or  a  non-beneficial  state?
Dr. MAGNIEN. I think it is at a beneficial state and we are work-
ing  very  hard  in  NOAA  to  help  support  that,  and  you  have  heard
a  number  of  our  efforts  to  support  that  through  workshops,
through the HARRNESS report which we provided funding for. We
have  had  workshops  in  Florida  recently.  We  are  going  to  have  an-
other  workshop  on  the  regional  problems  in  the  West  Coast.  We
have  gotten  great  participation  from  the  managers,  the  social  sci-
entists,  the  federal  agencies  and  we  are  also  working  very  hard
with  all  of  these  groups  in  putting  together  the  reports  for  the
HABHRCA  legislation  that  the  chairman  asked  me  about  earlier,
and  that  is,  you  know,  a  big  job  but  it  is  one  worth  taking  on  and
doing to the benefit of everybody.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you.  My  time  is  expired,  but  would  you

let Dr. Anderson have a word?

Dr.  ANDERSON.  Just  to  add  to  the  issue  of  the  transferability  of
the model results. It was our model that was doing this prediction.
These  models  generally  have  two  components,  a  physical  model
which is of the circulation of the water, and those are being devel-
oped all over the country, and into these we have to build the biol-
ogy of these HAB organisms. Many of the HAB organisms that we
work  on  do  occur  in  other  parts  of  the  country  so  the  one  that
causes  problems  in  New  England  also  occurs  along  the  coast  of
California and Washington and even Alaska, so I actually have re-
ceived  inquiries  and  have  invited  someone  from  Washington  to  my
lab to do some of the experiments that are needed to take their or-
ganism and to just change the parameters slightly so that they can
use our model. So in many cases I think these modeling efforts are
transferable with some tweaking of the organisms so that it reflects
this region as opposed to that region.

Mr. MCNERNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  You  are  welcome,  Mr.  McNerney.  Thank

you.

Mr. Akin, you are recognized for five minutes.

ALGAL BLOOM CAUSES: FERTILIZER RUNOFF AND CLIMATE

CHANGE

Mr.  AKIN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  we  have  three  hear-
ings  at  the  same  time.  It  is  hard  to  be  in  three  places  at  once,  so
I missed your testimonies.

The  first  question  I  have  is,  the  problem  of  fertilizer  runoff  and
things  like  that  off  of  land,  particularly  farmland,  has  long  been  a
problem. I think of it more in connection with Lake Erie and fresh-
water  bodies  more  than  saltwater  perhaps,  and  then  there  is  also
talk  though  about  conditions  in  the  ocean  where  there  is  some  pH
change.  It  is  not  driven  by  fertilizer  I  think  as  much  as  it  is  pH
change,  which  then  tends  to  destroy  coral  formations  and  things
like  that.  Are  these  in  any  way  connected  or  are  they  two  totally
separate situations, and which is more serious?

Dr.  MAGNIEN.  I  assume  you  are  talking  about  actually  three
things  here,  the  nutrient  connection  to  harmful  algal  blooms  but
also the ocean acidification connection to harmful algal blooms.

Mr. AKIN. Correct.
Dr.  MAGNIEN.  I  think  before  you  walked  in,  Dr.  Anderson  ad-
dressed  some  of  the  issues  related  to  the  ocean  acidification  and
that  it  is  so  early  in  the  research  phase  there  that  we  really  don’t
know how that particular situation is going to affect the multitude
of  different  species  that  compose  the  group  of  harmful  algae.  The
nutrient——

Mr. AKIN. Do we know for sure that it is a pH thing that is driv-

ing those conditions?

Dr. MAGNIEN. PH is involved but nutrients are much more over-

whelming in importance for harmful algal blooms.

Mr. AKIN. If you say the drivers, you are saying we know for sure

the nutrients is a huge part of it?

Dr. MAGNIEN. Right.
Mr. AKIN. The pH is not as clear-cut?
Dr.  MAGNIEN.  Exactly,  and  the  changes  we  are  seeing  at  least
now  in  pH  are  fairly  subtle,  so  it  may  become  an  issue  down  the
road  and  we  certainly  should  look  at  that,  but  for  now,  the  imme-
diate issue is nutrients and——

Mr. AKIN. Is it nitrogen or phosphorus?
Dr.  MAGNIEN.  It  can  be  both.  In  marine  systems,  it  tends  to  be
more nitrogen but phosphorus could be involved. In the freshwater
situations, it tends to be more phosphorus that kick up these large
blue-green  algae  blooms  in  freshwaters.  And  it  also  connects  with
another important issue in HABHRCA, which is the dissolved oxy-
gen  or  hypoxia  problem.  So  all  these  things  are  interrelated,  and
that is why we——

Mr.  AKIN.  But  these  reduce  the  oxygen  in  the  water,  don’t  they,

the algaes?

Dr.  MAGNIEN.  Right.  Well,  you  have  a  sequence  of  events  where
the excess nutrients pouring into these water bodies create an over-
abundance  of  algae,  the  algae  eventually  die,  decompose,  settle  to
the bottom and the decomposition process, they use up the oxygen,

leading to fish kills and loss of habitat, and that is one of the rea-
sons  why  you  have  heard  so  much  about  predictions  here.  We  try
to  put  all  this  complex  science  together  in  models  and  in  a  way
that  managers  can  make  decisions.  You  know,  we  can’t  just  wave
our  arms  and  say  nutrient  pollution  is  a  problem.  We  need  to  be
specific  and  say,  you  know,  if  you  reduce  it  X  percentage,  this  is
how it is going to affect the algal blooms.

Mr.  AKIN.  But  certainly  the  farmers  have  an  incentive,  increas-
ingly  an  incentive,  to  be  sparing  with  their  fertilizers,  so  with  the
new GPS systems where you are literally putting just the fertilizer
in  you  need,  has  that  become  pretty  effective  in  knocking  it  down
from where it was 10 or 20 years ago?

Dr.  MAGNIEN.  Well,  it  is  certainly  helping  but  we  still  have  got
a  huge  issue  there  and  actually  NOAA  has  been  talking  recently
with  USDA  to  try  to  work  with  them  and  address  this  nutrient
problem  as  well  with  EPA  and  other  State  and  federal  agencies
that can influence the situation.

Mr. AKIN. Can you comment on the change? I mean, if you take,
for  instance,  clean  air—I  am  from  the  St.  Louis  area.  If  you  take
a  look  at  the  air  that  I  was  breathing  as  a  high  school  student,
which  I  thought  was  pretty  good  air,  I  didn’t  have  much  other  al-
ternative but to breathe it, but if you take a look at that air by to-
day’s  standards,  I  mean,  it  is  orders  of  magnitude  cleaner  than  it
was  when  I  was  in  high  school.  Do  we  have  the  same  kinds  of  im-
provements? Because this is a problem that has been around for a
long time.

Dr. MAGNIEN. I would say we have comparable improvements on
what we call the point sources of nutrient pollution such as waste-
water  treatment  plants  and  industries.  We  have  done  yeoman’s
work  there  just  here  in  the  Potomac  River.  Some  of  those  images
that  we  saw  earlier,  the  green  paint-type  covering  of  the  water
used  to  be  right  here  in  the  Potomac  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  due
to  the  wastewater  treatment  at  Blue  Plains  and  other  big  treat-
ment  plants.  That  has  made  a  remarkable  recovery  comparable  to
the  air  issues.  Where  we  are  still  struggling  is  what  we  call  the
non-point  sources  which  are  primarily  agriculture,  runoff  from
urban  areas.  It  is  much  more  difficult.  It  is  much  more  pervasive.
It is not an engineering fix at a particular pipe, so we need to con-
tinue  to  be  vigilant  there  and  work  with  new  technologies  and
methodologies to help reduce that problem.

Mr.  AKIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  know  that  my  time  is  expired  but  I
thank you for your patience and thank you for appearing all of you
as our witnesses.

ECOHAB

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  for  your  good  questions.  The

chairman will recognize himself for five minutes.

Mr.  Ayres,  as  a  coastal  fisheries  manager,  what  NOAA  projects
and  efforts  are  most  helpful  to  you  in  dealing  with  the  impacts  of
harmful algal blooms? What could this program provide that would
be more helpful in the management decision-making process?

Mr.  AYRES.  Well,  a  recently  completed  or  nearly  completed
ECOHAB-funded  study  of  the  movement  of  Pseudonitzschia,  the
plankton  species  that  causes  the  problems  the  most  significant  on

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:32 Dec 26, 2008 Jkt 043278 PO 00000 Frm 00121 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\071008\43278 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

118

the  Washington  coast,  has  provided  us  a  lot  of  detail  about  how
that happens and has given us much better insight into how those
plankton  species  move  and  when  we  might  expect  problems  with
the  shellfish  that  we  are  managing  along  the  Washington  coast.  I
mean,  as  Dr.  Anderson  pointed  out  earlier,  continued  data  col-
lecting is so important to that, and the federal funding—specific re-
search. We have an understanding of how that works but still con-
tinued  visits  to  the  area  offshore,  the  offshore  sampling  that  the
state does not have the capability of funding needs to occur in some
way, and Dr. Anderson talked about ocean observing systems being
a possible way of doing that, whether it is opportunistic ride-alongs
on  NOAA  vessels.  We  have  some  staff  out  this  week  on  a  NOAA
vessel offshore just in an opportunistic way collecting some samples
in this specific area, the Strait of Wanafuka eddy. It is a region at
the mouth of the Strait of Wanafuka where these plankton species
tend to congregate and bloom and then eventually perhaps move on
to the Washington coast. We are also affected by blooms that come
from  the  south  part  of  our  coast  and  that  also  affect  the  Oregon
coast, widespread areas, and there was an ECOHAB proposal that
was identified for funding, and as Dr. Magnien pointed out earlier,
there  wasn’t  enough  funding  to  actually  allow  that  to  go  forward,
at least during this fiscal year, and hopefully it will happen in the
future.  So  additional  work  like  that,  ECOHAB,  large  studies  over
these large ocean areas that can identify not only the oceanography
but the specifics of what is happening, how do these plankton spe-
cies  move  onshore  would  be  very  helpful  to  managers  like  myself
in  Washington  and  Oregon  and  down  into  California.  We  are  talk-
ing  wide  areas.  And,  you  know,  we  have  a  trans-boundary  area  as
well  where  a  lot  of  these  blooms  are  coming  out  of  the  Canadian
waters  and  affecting  Canadian  waters  the  same  as  they  do  in  the
United  States.  So  continued  cooperation  with  researchers  in  Can-
ada is certainly important as well. We do a lot of work with Cana-
dians  on  a  lot  of  issues  because  of  that  trans-boundary  issue  in
Washington State. So the continued collection of just primary data
and  then  the  larger-scale  projects  like  ECOHAB  can  fund  is  very
important to managers like myself, especially in the Pacific North-
west.

MORE ON HARRNESS

Chairman LAMPSON. From a manager’s perspective, does the new
plan  that  the  research  community  has  published,  the  HARRNESS
plan, address the needed priorities and help in the prediction part?
Mr.  AYRES.  Yes.  HARRNESS  did  a  very  good  job  of  doing  that
and  I  think  a  very  good  job  not  only  for  a  manager  like  myself  in
the Pacific Northwest but for managers all around the country, and
that is because—and I give NOAA a lot of credit for bringing man-
agers  into  that  process,  and  not  only  fishery  mangers  but  human
health managers early on and so we had an opportunity to provide
a  lot  of  input,  and  if  you  look  at  HARRNESS,  you  will  see  com-
ments  by  managers  like  myself  throughout  the  document  pointing
out  what  is  important  to  us  and  HARRNESS  did  a  very  good  job
of  that.  And  the  RDDTT  plan  did  the  same  thing  and  it  was  a
great  opportunity  for  managers  to  be  a  part  of  that  process  in  a

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:32 Dec 26, 2008 Jkt 043278 PO 00000 Frm 00122 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\071008\43278 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

workshop format where we were able to provide a lot of input into
that workshop plan that will eventually then influence the plan.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Can  we  improve  it?  And  Dr.  Anderson,

would you also comment after Mr. Ayres?

Mr. AYRES. Pardon me?
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Are  there  any  ways  to  make  it—can  the

son?

plan be improved?

Mr. AYRES. Funding. Funding, funding, funding.
Chairman LAMPSON. That is the story of our life.
Mr. AYRES. Yeah, I think that is the primary answer.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Would  you  make  any  comment,  Dr.  Ander-

Dr.  ANDERSON.  Funding  is  always  the  answer,  but  one  of  the
ways to make that happen is partnerships among federal agencies,
and  we  could  use  the  help  of  committees  like  this  to  forge  some  of
those  partnerships.  There  are  many  agencies  that  have  mandates
where harmful algal blooms are involved at some level, and in fact,
a  number  of  them  are  not  participating  in  this  national  program.
I  could  name  a  few,  Department  of  Agriculture,  for  example,  or
EPA in some ways on the marine side in particular. So if we could
form  partnerships  and  get  some  of  these  agencies  to  put  their  re-
sources,  even  limited,  together,  we  would  start  to  have  successes.
ECOHAB  is  a  success  in  large  part  because  it  is  a  partnership,  as
NOAA,  NSF,  and  EPA  were  in  it  for  a  while,  as  well  as  the  Office
of Naval Research, and even NASA. So it is a partnership of agen-
cies  that  would  all  jointly  fund  projects.  So  to  me,  that  would  be
one of the areas where we could get some help.
FRESHWATER ALGAL BLOOMS

Chairman LAMPSON. I will ask a question for Dr. Hudnell. What
are  some  of  the  possible  options  for  addressing  the  freshwater
HABs?  Is  research  needed  to  understand  freshwater  HABs  much
like was needed for the marine and coastal HABs issue?

Dr. HUDNELL. In my opinion, I believe it is very likely that nutri-
ents  are  an  issue  both  for  freshwater  and  marine  HABs.  As  we
have heavy rainfalls, nutrients run off the non-point sources which
are harder to control, and they enter the freshwater and they flow
to the coast, and the water is all connected so you have first of all
the nutrients starting HABs in the freshwater. They move down to
estuaries. At estuaries, you may have the same species, same types
of cyanobacteria or other organisms, but then you also can pick up
new organisms that thrive better in the higher salinity range. And
then I think it is likely that this issue about marine HABs and nu-
trients, I just believe that all organisms require nutrients and that
if  more  nutrients  are  coming  in,  it  is  going  to  further  stimulate  it,
and  it  may  not  cause  the  marine  HABs  to  start  but  it  may,  I  be-
lieve,  feed  them  and  make  them  worse.  The  nutrient  input  reduc-
tion is critical, I believe, for controlling HABs, for addressing other
water  quality  problems,  and  we  should  make  a  better  attempt  to
control the input into the freshwater where it all starts.

Second  of  all,  in  freshwater  particularly,  we  can  circulate  water
where we know that it is too stagnant, where there are dams built,
for example, new reservoirs put in. We are building lots of new res-
ervoirs.  Two-thirds  of  our  population  now  get  their  drinking  water

from  surface  water  as  our  aquifers  are  becoming  depleted.  We  are
building  more  and  more  of  these,  and  unfortunately,  we  tend  to
have more and more situations where the water is too stagnant, too
quiescent, and that is causing blooms to happen in freshwater. And
if you look at a place like the Klamath River that starts in Oregon
and  moves  through  California  down  to  the  ocean,  in  recent  years
the  problem  has 
just  become  phenomenal  with  species  of
cyanobacteria  called  Microcystis,  and  it  often  starts  with  some
problems  in  the  upper  portions  of  the  river  but  then  when  you  get
to  the  reservoirs  where  there  have  been  dams  built,  you  start  to
see  these  massive  blooms  of  cyanobacteria  occurring  there,  and  it
is  because  the  water  is  so  stagnant,  and  there  we  have  seen  the
highest cell counts I have ever seen anywhere in the world and the
highest  toxin  levels,  many  thousands  of  times  above  the  WHO
guideline level for what is a safe level. It is a very dangerous situa-
tion.  And  what  happens  is,  these  dams  will  open  up  and  let  water
out,  and  last  year  for  the  first  time  there  were  so  many  cells  that
enough  survived  that  they  kept  moving  down  the  river  and  they
would be in one reservoir, move down, be in the next reservoir, and
one  of  the  slides  I  had  flashing  by  showed  them  hitting  the  ocean
and it was just all over the delta. So it is a problem of both nutri-
ents and cells moving down the water, and in my opinion, the best
thing  we  can  do,  particularly  in  sensitive  areas  like  shellfish  beds,
is  circulate  water  in  estuaries  and  places  where  it  is  too  stagnant
and  prevent  the  nutrients  from  getting  there  to  feed  those  HABs.
Chairman LAMPSON. Do any of your—the program that you men-
tioned earlier that you have down in Houston, have they tried that
in  larger—or  have  you  tried  it  in  larger  open  bodies  of  water  like
a lake?

Dr.  HUDNELL.  We  have  just  begun  to  do  some  of  that.  Some  of
these  lakes  are,  you  know,  more  than  100  square  miles.  We  are
now  starting  to  work  in  Lake  Taihu  in  China,  which  is  their  sec-
ond-largest  lake,  I  forget,  hundreds  of  square  miles  big,  and  they
have  terrible  Microcystis  blooms  every  year.  In  fact,  last  summer
the  town  of  Wuzi  of  several  million  people,  they  had  to  shut  down
all  the  drinking  water  plants  because  there  was  so  much  toxin  in
the water so people survived off of bottled water for weeks until the
situation came under control.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
Mr. Inglis.

REMOVING PHOSPHORUS FROM DISCHARGE

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr.  Hudnell,  you  had  mentioned  earlier  the  possibility  of  remov-
ing  phosphorus  from  discharge.  Where  are  the  economics  of  that?
I  take  it  not  very  good  and  that  is  why  it  is  not  being  done  right
now, or can they be somewhat positive?

Dr.  HUDNELL.  You  know,  there  has  not  been  research  on  that
near  enough  and  there  are  no  places  to  apply  for  funds  for  that
kind  of  research  that  I  know  of,  but  at  SolarBee,  we  have  recently
begun  to  look  at  this  issue  and  trying  different  approaches.  What
we are trying now is, where you have this floating platform pump-
ing  up  all  this  water  to  put  a  metal  ring  around  the  water  where
it  is  coming  into  the  unit  and  run  solar-powered  electric  charges

that  pulse  positive  and  negative  off  this  thing,  and  what  you  can
do is magnetize the phosphorus and attract it to these bars. If you
can  develop  a  system  that  will  attract  the  phosphorus  in  and  then
you  can  go  and  periodically  exchange  the  rings,  you  can  take  all
the  phosphorus  off  those  metal  rings  and  then  refuse  it.  And,  you
know,  this  is  just  a  very  small-scale  first  attempt  to  do  this  but  I
think  that  potentially  technology  will  allow  us  to  do  very  large-
scale  things  like  this  at  water  treatment  plants,  for  example,  and
recapture that phosphorus. We really have no alternative in the fu-
ture because the phosphorus is going to be depleted and we cannot
farm  without  phosphorus.  There  is  no  synthetic  alternative.  Every
living  organism  requires  phosphorus  but  we  are  using  up  all  the
natural reservoirs of phosphorus that we now mine, and like I said
before, production is predicted to peak in 30 years and the sources
be depleted in 50 to 100 years. So there are many reasons that this
technology  needs  to—research  needs  to  invest  in  this  type  of  tech-
nology to look at how to best recapture in an economical way these
nutrients  that  we  are  going  to  need  for  use  in  the  future  and  we
need now.

Mr. INGLIS. Dr. Anderson.
Dr.  ANDERSON.  If  I  could  just  add  to  that,  I  want  to  make  sure
that  we  have  it  clear  that  only  some  of  the  HABs  that  we  deal
with, both marine and freshwater, are related to nutrient pollution.
Certainly more so on the freshwater side, but many of the problems
around  this  country,  if  there  is  a  nutrient  impact,  it  is  sometimes
subtle, and so when we try to move forward with policies and pro-
grams, we have to look beyond just saying the problem is nutrients.
So  I  just  need  to  make  that  clear.  And  so  there  are  other  tech-
nologies  that  we  need  to  help  manage  those  problems,  whether  it
be  predictions  and  detection  systems  and  maybe  even  some  efforts
for bloom suppression that are not using nutrients as a preventive
tool  but  in  fact  going  after  the  cells  themselves  with  chemicals  or
parasites or something else like that. But I just want to make sure
that  the  Committee  doesn’t  get  the  impression  that  the  answer  is
nutrient reduction for all HABs.

Mr.  INGLIS.  What  could  be  the  other—just  to  recap  that.  The
other  possibilities  are  a  natural  phenomenon  that  is  occurring.  Is
that right?

Dr. ANDERSON. Yes.
Mr. INGLIS. And perhaps some other variables. What would those

be?

Dr.  ANDERSON.  Well,  again,  let  us  go  to  my  region.  We  have
looked  very  hard.  We  have  not  found  a  nutrient  relationship  with
the  Northeast  shellfish  poisoning  problems.  So  if  you  are  trying  to
manage  that  problem  or  do  something  about  it,  you  are  not  going
to  change  the  river  outflows  or  the  way  the  wind  blows  and  the
types  of  storms  we  get,  so  the  best  you  can  do  then  is  to  be  able
to  understand  the  system,  to  predict  it,  to  forecast  it  so  the
shellfishmen  and  the  industries  are  aware  of  what  is  coming.  You
develop  better  technologies  to  detect  these  cells  so  that  you  know
exactly  which  areas  should  be  closed  and  which  should  be  open.
You  can  in  a  sense  start  having  surgical  closures  of  harvesting  in-
stead  of  closing  an  entire  coastline.  You  can  close  here  and  there
but not over there. And so you have to live with the fact that these

122

are  natural  phenomena  and  learn  how  to  manage  around  them,
and in that case, that is plain management.

There are also other areas that we have talked about where tech-
nologies  can  be  used  to  suppress  a  bloom  or  control  a  bloom.  That
is  what  everyone  keeps  asking  me.  If  you  can  control  mosquitoes,
why  can’t  you  control  a  red  tide?  It  is  a  complex  answer  to  that,
but  there  are  technologies  out  there.  I  have  mentioned  the  clay,  I
have mentioned viruses, parasites and so forth. They all need more
research.  They  all  need  pilot  studies  and  then  some  actual  dem-
onstration projects to show whether they will or will not work and
then  we  can  perhaps  get  society  to  start  to  accept  them.  I  mean,
I  will  just  say  that  same  thing.  Imagine  your  estuary,  the  Puget
Sound is about to be invaded by some major organism that is going
to  destroy  who  knows  what,  salmon  or  something  like  that.  Right
now,  I  don’t  think  we  have  the  knowledge  or  the  mandate,  a  gov-
ernment  agency  mandate,  to  be  able  to  go  out  and  stop  that  in-
vader.  We  have  those  same  problems  for  HABs,  and  I  think  that
something needs to change to help us fight that battle.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Dr.  Baird,  you  are  recognized  for  five  min-

utes.

DRINKING WATER QUALITY

Mr.  BAIRD.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  say  that  one  of  the  reasons
I particularly enjoy this committee is, we get to address issues that
are not on the political radar screen but may actually be very pro-
found both economically and from a health perspective.

I want to ask for clarification or edification for myself, the toxins
that  are  produced  from  some  of  these  HABs,  my  understanding  is,
they  are  not—when  we  look  at  our  normal  water  filtration  and
treatment  systems,  my  understanding  is,  some  of  these  toxins  are
not  filtered  out.  In  other  words,  if  I  were  a  hiker  going  to  a  lake
that  had  a  HAB  in  it,  I  might  get  my  usual  filter  out  and  think
oh,  you  know,  I  am  thinking  I  am  going  to  get  out,  you  know,
Giardia  or  something  like  that,  but  the  toxins  themselves  can  still
be toxic even with normal filtration. Is that accurate?

Dr.  HUDNELL.  Well,  I  can  speak  directly  to  the  freshwater
cyanobacteria toxins, and that in fact is one of the things that wor-
ries  me  the  very  most.  There  is  a  lot  of  data  from  Florida,  for  ex-
ample,  that  shows  if  you  repeatedly  measure  toxin  levels  in  the
raw  source  water  and  in  the  finished  drinking  water,  many  times
you  will  find  the  toxin  levels  to  be  higher  in  the  finished  drinking
water than the raw source water. The reason that occurs is because
when  you  bring  in  water  to  the  plant,  one  of  the  first  things  you
do is filter it, and when you filter it, that lyses or breaks open the
cells,  and  then  the  cells  release  all  their  toxin  into  the  water.  And
normal  drinking  water  processing  as  shown  by  the  Florida  just
does  not  get  these  toxins  out.  And  I  have  looked  a  lot  into  this
issue  with  one  of  my  colleagues  who  specializes  in  this,  Judy
Westrick, and other people, and what you find when you do labora-
tory  tests  is  that  even  if  you  take  only  one  toxin,  one  cyanotoxin
which  is  Microcystin,  well,  actually  there  are  over  80  known
analogs  of  that  toxin,  and  if  you  look  at  different  methods  to  try

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:32 Dec 26, 2008 Jkt 043278 PO 00000 Frm 00126 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\071008\43278 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

123

to  deactivate,  breakdown,  or  get  rid  of  that  toxin,  you  find  that
some  things  work  for  a  few  analogs,  some  work  for  a  few  other
analogs.  There  is  just  no  way  that  we  can  get  all  of  these  toxins
out  with  any  kind  of  affordable  processing.  The  only  answer  I  can
see is that we simply have to prevent these toxins from coming into
the  plant  in  the  first  place,  and  surely  if  you  go  out  camping  with
your  water  filter  and  you  see  some  green  water,  I  would  hope  you
will not try to filter it and drink it because it is not going to work.
Mr.  BAIRD.  I  used  that  as  an  example  because  I  think  we  have
become  accustomed  to  think  oh,  we  have  water  treatment  centers
that  will  protect  us  from  this,  and  the  point  is,  this  is  a  different
kind of entity that is our problem.

I  want  to  go  back  to  this  issue  of  nutrients.  You  know,  a  couple
years  ago,  Dr.  Ehlers  and  I  were  working  on  a  bill  relating  to
harmful  algal  blooms  and  I  put  in  a  provision  to  deal  with  the
causes  of  it,  and  it  was  interesting,  this  provision  got  completely
hung  up  for  reasons  unknown  to  us.  We  could  not  understand  it.
We  had  to  put  a  lot  of  work  in.  Why  is  someone  blocking  it?  It
turned  out  a  staff  member,  who  was  also  on  the  ag  committee,
didn’t  want  research  looking  at  the  causes  of  this  lest  we  dem-
onstrate  scientifically  that  runoff  from  farms  or  agricultural  oper-
ations,  feedlots,  whatsoever,  were  causing  HABs  so  this  portion  of
the  bill  got  just  completely  hung  up,  and  I  am  interested  in—and
Mr.  Ayres,  you  deal  with  the  economic  costs  downstream  of  this.
What are your thoughts or your experience or yours or anyone else
on the panel of trying to reduce the upstream inputs that may con-
tribute collectively to damage downstream?

Mr. AYRES. Well, certainly the downstream economic impacts are
big,  and  not  even  well  quantified,  although  in  my  written  testi-
mony,  you  will  see  there  is  a  study  that  is  about  to  be  completed
that  will  give  us  some  insight  in  our  specific  case  in  Washington
State  on  the  economic  impacts  of  some  of  these  fisheries,  and  I
agree  with  Dr.  Anderson,  at  least  in  the  Pacific  Northwest  exam-
ple,  we  are  not  sure  if  there  is  any  specific  causes  of  the  blooms
that  we  are  seeing.  They  are  naturally  occurring.  Are  there  some
specific  nutrients  that  are  coming  out  of  the  Strait  of  Wanafuka?
I  mean,  the  Strait  of  Wanafuka  empties  water  out  of  the  Puget
Sound  region,  the  Strait  of  Georgia,  some  big  population  centers,
so  it  is  not  impossible  to  believe  that  that  might  be  the  case.  But
I don’t think the science has proven it to this point to be the case.
But  certainly  if  there  were  some  proof  like  that  and  there  was
some  ability  to  reduce  the  impacts  these  HABs  have  on  our  coast-
line  as  a  result  of  reducing  some  of  the  upstream  effects,  that
would be a good thing, and I agree with that, but I don’t think the
science  yet  in  our  case  in  Washington  State  says  that  is  the  case.
In other places in the Nation where that is the case, certainly, the
cost-benefit  issues  that  you  talked  about  earlier  should  be  looked
at and balanced accordingly.

Dr.  HUDNELL.  If  I  could,  I  would  like  to  say  that  while  there  is
some controversy about how much nutrients are involved in the red
tides,  marine  HABs,  there  is  really  no  controversy  for  the  fresh-
water  HABs.  It  is  very  clear  that  nutrients  are  the  driving  force.
Nitrogen  and  phosphorus  are  the  two  most  important—cells  need
three things. They need carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and then

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:32 Dec 26, 2008 Jkt 043278 PO 00000 Frm 00127 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\071008\43278 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

124

some  trace  metals.  But  there  is  some  plenty  of  carbon.  You  can’t
do  anything  about  that.  There  is  some  nitrogen  and  there  are  spe-
cies that can fix nitrogen. They can take unusable forms out of the
air or water and fix it in the forms that they can use for nutrients.
And  then  phosphorus  is  the  only  thing  that  is  limiting  for  every-
thing, so it is important for freshwater to keep the phosphorus out,
and  the  ratio  between  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  determines  which
type of cyanobacteria bloom. So it is important to get them all out.
But  it  is  clear  that  with  the  freshwater  issue,  reducing  nutrients
will  reduce  the  occurrence,  but  it  is  a  very  long  time  frame  where
you can reduce nutrients in an area that always has—annually has
HABs.  It  will  be  a  long  time  before  you  can  get  the  nutrient  level
down  to  where  you  won’t  have  them,  and  there  are  a  couple  rea-
sons  for  that.  We  have  already  dealt  some  with  the  point  sources
by  reducing  nutrients  coming  out  of  the  pipe.  As  has  been  said,  it
is  much  more  difficult  to  deal  with  the  non-point  sources,  and  we
need  better  research  and  effort  into  best  management  practices  to
reduce  the  amount  of  nutrient  we  are  putting  on  plants  to  begin
with and then to find better ways to contain the runoff and maybe
recapture  the  nutrients  there  before  it  finally  gets  into  the  fresh-
water.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Dr. Baird, and thank all of you.
Dr.  Baird,  you  are  right:  This  has  to  be  the  most  fascinating  com-
mittee  in  Congress.  We  get  to  hear  some  significant  things  and
hopefully learn enough to be able to react to what it is that we are
learning because of its impact on us and——

Dr. HUDNELL. If I could make one more comment about that?
Chairman LAMPSON. Please do.
Dr.  HUDNELL.  I  was  in  a  kind  of  in  the  middle  of  an  uncomfort-
able situation in Florida related to this nutrient issue, and you are
talking  about  competing  interests.  The  last  couple  of  years  I  was
invited  to  talk  at  a  number  of  localities  in  Florida  because  they
were trying to really rush legislation that would say in our locality,
you  cannot  use  certain  types  of  fertilizer,  you  have  to  limit  the
amount  you  put  down.  They  wanted  to  pass  restrictions  on  fer-
tilizer  usage  because,  you  know,  they  have  grass  up  to  the  edge  of
canals and all that fertilizer going in the water and big blooms, but
on  the  other  end,  you  have  the  huge  agricultural  interests  in  the
middle of the state who are doing lots of farming and doing—using
lots  of  fertilizer  and  they  are  coming  down  the  rivers  and  so  there
was a situation where the state was trying to pass a fertilizer regu-
lation that would say this is what we are going to do and localities
cannot do beyond this. So the localities were trying before the state
passed  theirs  to  get  their  placeholders  in  place  so  that  they
wouldn’t  be  blocked  from  passing  legislation  on  fertilizer.  So  we
really  need  some  kind  of  national  leadership  to  help  the  localities
and the states see the best road to take to do the right thing.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much, and thank all of you

for all your comments. We appreciate you being here.
