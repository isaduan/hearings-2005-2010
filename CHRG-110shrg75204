EFFECTS  OF  CLIMATE  CHANGE 

ON  MARINE  AND  COASTAL  ECOSYSTEMS 

IN  WASHINGTON  STATE 

TUESDAY,  MAY  27,  2008 

SUBCOMMITTEE ON OCEANS, ATMOSPHERE, FISHERIES, 
AND COAST GUARD, 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m. at the Se-
attle  Aquarium,  1483  Alaskan  Way,  Seattle,  Washington,  Hon. 
Maria Cantwell, Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding. 

Seattle, WA. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator  CANTWELL.  The  Senate  Committee  on  Commerce, 
Science,  and  Transportation,  Subcommittee  on  Oceans,  Atmos-
phere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard will come to order. 

We  are  here  today  in  Seattle  to  do  a  field  hearing  on  the  effect 
of  climate  change  on  marine  coastal  ecosystems  in  Washington 
State.  So  thank  you  all  very  much  for  being  here,  and  my  thanks 
to the Seattle Aquarium for their hospitality. 

Today’s hearing, as you can see, is the perfect venue for what we 
are  going  to  be  talking  about,  and  each  year,  this  aquarium  gives 
hundreds  of  thousands  of  visitors  a  window  into  Washington’s  un-
derwater wildlife. And so, today, we get to be here beneath that to 
see  and  understand  what  we  need  to  be  doing,  more  importantly, 
on the issue of climate change. 

Over the last 200 years, the oceans have absorbed nearly half of 
the CO2 that basically has been emitted through combustion of fos-
sil  fuels.  With  the  ocean’s  absorption  of  CO2,  it  reacts  with  sea-
water  to  form  carbonic  acid  that  ends  up  making  our  oceans  more 
acidic. 

What  are  those  impacts?  Well,  we  are  going  to  hear  in  more  de-
tail  from  the  panelists  today.  But  the  impacts  are  to  our  salmon 
and other fisheries, the threat to the entire marine food chain, the 
increased  water  temperatures  bring  about  new  invasive  species. 
The spread of dead zones because of the lack of oxygen in the water 
are  a  threat  to  all  of  our  marine  life,  and  obviously,  the  warming 
of  our  oceans  portend  to  make  a  rise  in  sea  levels  that  could  have 
devastating impacts on lowlands and wetlands here in Washington 
State and around the Nation.

So  it  is  very  important  that  we  clearly  understand  the  carbon 
emission  impacts,  what  will  happen  in  the  marine  environment, 
and  the  fact  that  they  could  be  all  too  devastating  here  in  Puget 
Sound. While this may not be easy to always understand the phys-
ical  impacts,  the  warning  signals  are  there,  and  we  need  to  exam-
ine them, more importantly. 

Fortunately,  we  know  that  we  can  have  an  impact  on  climate 
change, and when we return to the U.S. Senate next week, we will 
be  having  a  Senate  discussion  on  the  climate  change  bill  on  the 
floor  of  the  U.S.  Senate.  We  hope  to  pass  that  legislation  over  to 
the House of Representatives for their action. 

And just recently, last year, the Energy Independence and Secu-
rity  Act  was  passed,  which  set  a  new  standard  for  the  fuel  effi-
ciency  of  automobiles,  more  efficiency  in  lighting  and  appliances, 
and  to  make  a  mandate  on  alternative  fuels  based  on  a  nonfood 
source. 

All  these  things  together  by  2030  would  help  us  displace  the 
equivalent of one-third of our foreign oil needs, save American con-
sumers  a  half  trillion  dollars  in  energy  costs,  and  reduce  our  Na-
tion’s carbon dioxide emissions by that same amount. 

So we know we have lots of work to do. And we know that land-
mark  legislation  is  needed.  The  reality  is,  though,  our  government 
at  this  point  in  time  is  ill-equipped  to  deal  with  the  consequences 
of  climate  change.  That  is  why  I  was  proud  to  author  the  Climate 
Change  Adaptation  Act  bill  that  would  direct  the  Federal  Govern-
ment to start planning for climate change and its impact on marine 
resources.  This  bill  has  been  passed  out  of  the  Commerce  Com-
mittee and is now waiting for action on the Senate floor. 

We  also  have  been  working  on  the  Federal  Ocean  Acidification 
Research and Monitoring Act legislation that was sponsored by my 
colleague  Senator  Frank  Lautenberg  from  New  Jersey  and  would 
establish  a  much-needed  research  program  on  ocean  acidification. 
The  time  now  is  for  the  Federal  Government  to  take  the  right 
steps in the right direction. I believe that these two bills are impor-
tant  vehicles  for  us  to  move  forward  on  the  right  path  in  helping 
the health of our oceans. 

Planning for the future isn’t just common sense. It is responsible 
government,  and  this  hearing  is  an  important  step  in  the  input 
that  we  need  to  continue  to  take  those  important  steps  of  pro-
tecting our oceans and certainly in protecting Puget Sound. 

So  I  want  to  thank  my  colleague,  Congressman  Inslee,  who  has 
joined me from the House of Representatives today for this Senate 
field hearing. He is a member of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee  and  the  House  Natural  Resources  Committee  and  has 
spent  many  hours  talking  and  hearing  about  these  issues  and  cer-
tainly  joins  me  in  an  effort  to  try  to  better  understand  the  impact 
of  CO2 on  our  oceans  and  what  we  need  to  do  to  protect  marine 
life in the Puget Sound area. 

So, Congressman, we thank you for being here. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JAY INSLEE, 

U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM WASHINGTON 
Representative INSLEE. Thank you. Thank you, Senator.

I  hope  people  know  that  we  have  an  absolute  champion  in  the 
U.S. Senate on the energy issues that are necessary to stop this de-
pletion  of  the  oceans,  and  that  is  Senator  Cantwell.  She  most  re-
cently  has  been  a  champion  to  adopt  a  package  for  renewable  tax 
credits for clean energy sources that could help solve this problem, 
and she has been doing great work in the U.S. Senate. 

My  comments,  I  wanted  to  share  with  you  two  memories—one 
piece  of  extremely  disturbing  news  and  one  piece  of  good  news. 
First, the memories. 

My  dad  was  the  biology  teacher  at  Garfield  High  School,  and 
maybe  even  taught  Jimi  Hendrix  biology,  I  am  not  sure.  But  my 
earliest  memories  are  being  at  Carkeek  Park  and  my  dad  showing 
me the sea lion from the shorelines of Carkeek Park. It was an ab-
solute  thrill  for  me  at  age,  I  don’t  know,  4  or  5  to  go  down  there 
and see that lion. 

That  life  has  diminished  now  at  Carkeek  Park.  What  I  saw  at 
Carkeek  Park  in  1956  and  1957  isn’t  there  as  much  as  it  used  to 
be,  and  we  are  in  a  continuing  decline  for  some  of  the  reasons  we 
will talk about today. 

The  second  memory  is  a  picture,  a  movie.  My  favorite  movie  of 
my wife is when she was 10 years old catching a salmon right here 
on  Old  Kinder  Road  out  at  Ray’s  Boathouse,  if  anybody  is  old 
enough to remember that. The best picture I have ever seen of her. 
Those  are  memories  that  we  want  our  grandkids  to  have.  And 
those  memories  today  are  at  risk  because  of  the  constellation  of 
issues that we are going to hear about. 

Now, here is the problem. We know about sea temperature rising 
due  to  climate  change.  We  know  about  sea  level  rising  due  to  cli-
mate  change.  We  know  about  wind  and  wave  patterns  changing 
due to climate change. Fairly well known. 

But  there  has  been  an  absolute  bomb  explode  in  the  scientific 
community  in  the  last  2  years,  and  that  is  the  silent  assassin  of 
ocean acidification, and that is what I want to focus on today. 

In  May  1996,  we  had  a  doctor  named  Ken  Caldeira  from  Stan-
ford  and  some  of  his  colleagues  that  I  invited  to  the  House.  And 
he  came  and  dropped  a  little  bomb  in  our  laps,  and  that  was  that 
even if we could figure out a way to stop the climate from changing 
and could decrease the CO2, that all this was going into the oceans 
and acidifying the oceans 30 percent—30 percent more ocean acidi-
fication, 30 percent more of those ions in the ocean than in pre-in-
dustrial times. 

And  he  went  on  to  explain  about  the  calcification  that  occurs 
where these little tiny zooplankton and pteropods have to take cal-
cium  to  form  a  substrate  for  their  life.  Probably  40  to  50  percent 
of  the  bottom  of  the  food  chain  is  dependent  on  this,  and  this  is 
greatly threatened by ocean acidification. 

Nothing  is  more  potentially  dangerous  to  humanity  than  ocean 
acidification,  I  believe,  as  the  first  big  problem  that  we  are  going 
to face, and that is because we receive a significant part of our pro-
tein from the ocean. And that is greatly, greatly threatened. 

So  the  good  news  is,  we  have  some  of  the  world’s  best  scientists 
today  on  this  panel,  that  I  am  very  appreciative.  But  there  is  no 
solution  to  this  problem,  except  reduction  of  carbon  dioxide.  That 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Jul 24, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\GPO\DOCS\75204.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

4 

is the only solution to prevent us from essentially depopulating the 
bottom of the food chain in the oceans. 

I  also  want  to  say  that  this  is  not  a  problem  for  tomorrow,  and 
all  of  this  kind  of  thing,  global  warming,  is  a  problem  for  the  next 
several  decades.  It  is  a  problem  today.  Almost  80  percent  of  the 
coral  reefs  in  our  national  parks  in  the  Virgin  Islands  are  dead 
today  because  of  a  combination  of  bleaching  associated  with  water 
temperature  and  perhaps  ocean  acidification.  This  is  a  problem 
today. 

But it is a problem that ought to unite us. You know, I hear still 
some  of  my  colleagues  in  Congress  that  are  still  adopting  the  pos-
ture  of  the  ostrich  with  their  head  in  the  sand  when  it  comes  to 
climate  change.  They  want  to  say  there  is  some  debate  about  this. 
Well,  fine.  But  there  is  no  debate  about  ocean  acidification.  That 
carbon  dioxide  is  going  into  the  ocean.  No  one  debates  that.  This 
ought to be a unifying theory on this. 

Now,  we  are  starting  to  see  some  progress.  I  just  want  to  leave 
it on a good note. Due to Senator Cantwell’s great work in the Sen-
ate,  we  are  starting  to  see  some  progress.  I  passed  an  amendment 
to  the  Magnuson  reauthorization  bill  to  require  study  of  the  ocean 
acidification. A year or so ago, I sponsored a bill somewhat similar 
to Cantwell’s in the House. 

But the real work we need to do is to decarbonize the energy sys-
tem of America. And when we do that, we will stop the acidification 
of  the  ocean,  and  we  will  build  the  largest  economic  expansion 
America has seen when we go to solar thermal power, solar photo-
voltaic  power,  wind  energy,  enhanced  geothermal  power,  electric 
vehicles,  energy  efficient  buildings.  And  when  we  do  this,  this  is 
how  we  are  going  to  solve  this  problem.  We  are  going  to  grow  our 
economy at the same time. 

So  I  am  optimistic  about  doing  it,  and  I  want  to  thank  Senator 

Cantwell for her leadership in being here today. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Congressman Inslee, for working 
with me on that legislation, including getting the energy tax credits 
passed  so  that  we  can  make  sure  that  we  have  a  predictable  tax 
law for renewable energy. 

Well,  let  us  welcome  our  panel  here  today.  Thank  you.  You  are 
a very distinguished set of guests testifying before this Senate sub-
committee. We appreciate you being here today. 

Joining us is Dr. Chris Sabine, Oceanographer with the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at the Pacific Marine En-
vironmental Laboratory. Dr. Sabine is an expert on ocean acidifica-
tion  and  the  author  of  a  recent  article,  ‘‘Evidence  for  Upwelling  of 
Corrosive  ‘Acidified’  Water  onto  the  Continental  Shelf.’’  Welcome. 
Thank you for being here. 

Dr. Terrie Klinger, University of Washington, Associate Professor 
at  the  School  of  Marine  Affairs.  Dr.  Klinger  is  a  marine  biologist 
who  looks  at  the  effects  on  the  environment  of  stressors,  including 
climate change on marine ecosystems. 

Dr. Edward Miles, also of the University of Washington, from the 
School of Marine Affairs. Thank you very much for being here. Dr. 
Miles  is  the  Co-Chair  of  the  Climate  Impacts  Group.  He  performs 
fundamental research related to the implications of climate change 
for  national  fisheries,  natural  resources,  and  economic  prospects.

He has served as Chair of the Ocean Policy Committee for the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences from 1974 to 1979 and has worked with 
the United Nations UNESCO on development of various policies. 

Our  next  witness  will  be  Dr.  Jeff  Koenings,  the  Director  of  the 
Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. Thank you for being 
here.  I  guess  it  all  gets  down  to  you  as  it  relates  to  the  local  level 
here,  or  I  should  say  at  least  to  the  State  and  local  level.  And  he 
manages marine resources, land resources, including fisheries. And 
so, we appreciate you being here and your background in scientific 
study of water quality and nutrients. 

And  following  him  will  Brett  Bishop,  Owner  of  the  Little 
Skookum  Shellfish  Growers.  Thank  you  for  representing  the  shell-
fish growers here today. I know you are going to give support testi-
mony  on  the  impact  of  a  very  vibrant  industry  for  us  in  Wash-
ington State and how the changes in climate might impact that in-
dustry. 

And last, but certainly not least, Kevin Ranker, who is San Juan 
County  Commissioner.  And  prior  to  taking  office,  Mr.  Ranker 
worked for 15 years focusing on coastal and ocean policies being de-
veloped  with  local,  national,  and  international  organizations.  Mr. 
Ranker  currently  serves  as  a  member  of  Puget  Sound  Ecosystem 
Coordination Board. 

So  thank  you  all  very  much  for  being  here.  And  while  this  is  an 
official  hearing  and  I  am  not  going  to  time  you,  but  if  you  could 
keep your remarks to 5 or 6 minutes, that would help us in getting 
questions to you at the end of that time period. 

Mr.  Sabine,  we  are  going  to  start  with  you.  And  thank  you  very 

much for being here today. 

STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER L. SABINE, PH.D., 

PACIFIC MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY, NOAA, 

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
Dr. SABINE. Good morning, Madam Chairwoman. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  And  you  are  probably  going  to  have  to  pull 

that microphone a little closer to make sure we can hear. 

Dr.  SABINE.  Good  morning,  Madam  Chairwoman.  Can  you  hear 

me? 

Senator  CANTWELL.  A  little  closer.  The  acoustics  here  might  be 

a little challenging. So—— 

Dr.  SABINE.  Good  morning,  Madam  Chairwoman  and  Congress-
man Inslee. I am Dr. Christopher Sabine. I am a chemical oceanog-
rapher  at  NOAA’s  Pacific  Marine  Environmental  Laboratory  lo-
cated  here  in  Seattle.  I  also  serve  as  an  affiliate  faculty  member 
of  oceanography  at  the  University  of  Washington  and  as  a  senior 
fellow  for  the  Joint  Institute  for  the  Study  of  Oceans  and  Atmos-
phere  at  the  University  of  Washington.  Thank  you  for  inviting  me 
to be a witness at this hearing. 

My colleague Dr. Richard Feely and I have conducted several re-
search  projects  to  improve  our  understanding  of  climate  change 
and ocean acidification in open ocean and coastal waters, including 
the  West  Coast  of  the  United  States  and  the  Puget  Sound  region. 
Today,  I  will  focus  on  just  one  aspect  of  that  research,  the 
upwelling  of  Pacific  waters  onto  the  continental  shelf.  The  results 
of this research were published last Thursday in Sciencexpress.

Over  the  last  two  decades,  NOAA  and  the  National  Science 
Foundation  have  co-sponsored  high  traffic  and  chemical  surveys  of 
the world’s oceans to study the response to rising atmospheric car-
bon dioxide. These studies have confirmed that the oceans are cur-
rently  absorbing  approximately  one-third  of  the  carbon  dioxide 
emissions from human activity. 

These  studies  have  also  documented  chemical  changes  in  sea-
water  resulting  from  the  absorption  of  this  carbon  dioxide,  which 
are increasing the acidity of the seawater and lowering its pH, the 
scale we use to measure acidity. 

The  decomposition  of  dead  and  sinking  organisms  naturally 
makes  deep  ocean  waters  corrosive  to  the  shells  and  skeletons  of 
calcium-carbonate  creating  organisms  such  as  corals,  clams,  oys-
ters, mussels, sea urchins, and pteropods. The depth at which these 
shells begins to dissolve is called the carbonate saturation horizon. 
The ocean uptake of manmade carbon dioxide has caused the satu-
ration horizon to rise toward the surface by as much as 100 to 200 
meters since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. 

In the North Pacific, the saturation horizon is naturally between 
100 and 400 meters, but is getting shallower at a rate of 1 to 2 me-
ters each and every year. Ocean model projections based on future 
carbon  dioxide  emission  scenarios  have  suggested  that  the  satura-
tion horizon could break the surface of the North Pacific within the 
next  50  to  100  years,  exposing  living  organisms  at  the  ocean  sur-
face to corrosive waters. 

During  the  2004  survey,  which  went  from  Japan  to  San  Diego, 
we  noticed  that  the  corrosive  waters  came  very  close  to  the  conti-
nental  shelf  of  North  America.  To  learn  more  about  this  phe-
nomenon,  we  brought  together  regional  experts  such  as  Debby 
Ianson  from  the  Institute  of  Ocean  Sciences  in  Canada,  Burke 
Hales  from  Oregon  State  University,  and  Martin  Hernandez-Ayon 
from the University of Autonoma in Mexico to help us design a sur-
vey to run from Queen Charlotte Sound in Canada to the tip of the 
Baja  Peninsula  in  Mexico,  with  the  goal  of  evaluating  the  state  of 
ocean acidification along the continental shelf. 

These  experts  helped  us  to  determine  the  optimum  sampling 
strategy  that  we  needed  to  participate  on  the  cruise  that  was  con-
ducted in May and June of 2007, last summer. I do not believe that 
any of us anticipated the results that we actually found. 

Our  measurements  showed  that  upwelling  along  the  West  Coast 
of  North  America  is  now  drawing  water  from  below  the  saturation 
horizon  and  up  onto  the  continental  shelf.  This  upwelling  happens 
during  the  spring  and  summer  months  when  winds  push  surface 
waters  away  from  the  coast  and  draw  carbon  dioxide-rich  waters 
from  about  150  to  200  meters  depth  in  the  open  ocean  to  much 
shallower depths up on the continental shelf. 

In  fact,  we  observed  that  some  of  the  low  pH  corrosive  waters 
had  actually  upwelled  all  the  way  to  the  surface  off  of  Northern 
California. 

Our estimates of manmade carbon dioxide contributions to these 
waters suggest that prior to the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, 
the  saturation  horizon  was  too  deep  to  be  reached  by  coastal 
upwelling.  In  other  words,  this  is  a  relatively  recent  phenomenon.

Before we started this work, no one considered that the corrosive 
offshore  waters  could  be  affecting  shallower  coastal  ecosystems 
today. However, our findings represent the first evidence that large 
sections of the North American continental shelf are already being 
seasonally impacted by ocean acidification and that shelf organisms 
are being exposed to corrosive waters even at the surface. 

Our  research  focused  on  understanding  the  chemistry  and  did 
not  directly  evaluate  biological  impacts  to  these  corrosive  waters. 
However,  the  fact  that  extensive  upwelling  occurs  all  along  the 
West Coast of North America and given the importance of fisheries, 
particularly  shellfish,  on  the  U.S.  continental  shelf,  the  potential 
biological  consequences  of  these  new  findings  need  to  be  assessed 
immediately. 

Where we thought we had another 50 years to figure out the con-
sequences  of  these  corrosive  waters  reaching  the  ocean’s  surface, 
we  are  finding  that  it  is  happening  today  right  outside  our  back 
door. 

Thank  you  again  for  inviting  me  to  testify,  and  I  will  be  happy 

to answer any questions you may have.

Good morning, Chairman Cantwell and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you 
for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  you  today  on  the  effects  of  climate 
change  on  marine  and  coastal  ecosystems  in  Washington  State.  My  name  is  Chris-
topher Sabine, I am an Oceanographer at the Pacific Marine Environmental Labora-
tory  of  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  in  Seattle, 
Washington. 

My  research  focuses  on  understanding  the  global  carbon  cycle.  In  particular,  my 
work centers around interpreting inorganic carbon measurements in the oceans. On 
Thursday,  May  22,  2008,  my  colleagues  and  I  published  a  paper  in  Science  Maga-
zine entitled: ‘‘Evidence for Upwelling of Corrosive ‘Acidified’ Water onto the Conti-
nental Shelf.’’ 

The absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide into the ocean lowers the pH of the 
waters. This so-called ocean acidification could have important consequences for ma-
rine ecosystems. In order to better understand the extent of this ocean acidification 
in coastal waters, we conducted hydrographic surveys from central Canada to north-
ern Mexico. We observed seawater that is undersaturated with respect to aragonite 
upwelling  onto  large  portions  of  the  continental  shelf,  reaching  depths  of  approxi-
mately 40 to 120 m along most transect lines and all the way to the surface on one 
transect  off  northern  California.  While  seasonal  upwelling  of  the  undersaturated 
waters  onto  the  shelf  is  a  natural  phenomenon  in  this  region,  the  ocean  uptake  of 
anthropogenic CO2 has increased the areal extent of the affected area. 

The Science paper is appended here as the scientific basis of my testimony.

EVIDENCE FOR UPWELLING OF CORROSIVE ‘‘ACIDIFIED’’ WATER ONTO THE 

CONTINENTAL SHELF 

Richard A. Feely,1 Christopher L. Sabine,1 J. Martin Hernandez-Ayon,2 Debby Ianson,3 Burke Hales 4 

The absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide into the ocean lowers the pH of the 
waters. This so-called ocean acidification could have important consequences for ma-
rine ecosystems. In order to better understand the extent of this ocean acidification 
in coastal waters, we conducted hydrographic surveys from central Canada to north-
ern Mexico. We observed seawater that is undersaturated with respect to aragonite 
upwelling  onto  large  portions  of  the  continental  shelf,  reaching  depths  of  approxi-
mately  40–120  m  along  most  transect  lines  and  all  the  way  to  the  surface  on  one 
transect  off  northern  California.  While  seasonal  upwelling  of  the  undersaturated 
waters  onto  the  shelf  is  a  natural  phenomenon  in  this  region,  the  ocean  uptake  of 
anthropogenic CO2 has increased the areal extent of the affected area. 

Over  the  past  250  years  the  release  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  from  industrial  and 
agricultural activities has resulted in atmospheric CO2 concentrations that have in-
creased by about 100 parts per million (ppm). The atmospheric concentration of CO2 
is  now  higher  than  it  has  been  for  at  least  the  last  650,000  years,  and  is  expected 
to  continue  to  rise  at  an  increasing  rate,  leading  to  significant  changes  in  our  cli-
mate  by  the  end  of  this  century.1.  Since  the  beginning  of  the  industrial  era,  the 
oceans have absorbed approximately 127 ± 18 billion metric tons of carbon as carbon 
dioxide  from  the  atmosphere,  or  about  one-third  of  the  anthropogenic  carbon  emis-
sions  released.2 This  process  of  absorption  of  anthropogenic  CO2 has  benefited  hu-
mankind by significantly reducing the greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere and 
minimizing  some  of  the  impacts  of  global  warming.  However,  the  ocean’s  daily  up-
take  of  30  million  metric  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  is  significantly  impacting  its  chem-
istry and biology. Recent hydrographic surveys and modeling studies have confirmed 
that  the  uptake  of  anthropogenic  CO2 by  the  oceans  has  resulted  in  a  lowering  of 
seawater  pH  by  about  0.1  since  the  beginning  of  the  industrial  revolution.3-7 This 
phenomenon,  which  is  commonly  called  ‘‘ocean  acidification,’’  could  affect  some  of 
the most fundamental biological and geochemical processes of the sea in the coming 
decades  and  could  seriously  alter  the  fundamental  structure  of  pelagic  and  benthic 
ecosystems.8 

Estimates of future atmospheric and oceanic carbon dioxide concentrations, based 
on  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  CO2 emission  scenarios 
and  general  circulation  models,  indicate  that  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  levels 
could exceed 500 parts per million (ppm) by the middle of this century, and 800 ppm 
near  the  end  of  the  century.  This  increase  would  result  in  a  surface  water  pH  de-
crease  of  approximately  0.4  pH  units,  and  a  corresponding  50  percent  decrease  in 
carbonate  ion  concentration  by  the  end  of  the  century.5,9 Such  rapid  changes  are 
likely  to  negatively  impact  marine  ecosystems,  seriously  jeopardizing  the  multi-
faceted economies that currently depend on them.10 

The reaction of CO2 with seawater reduces the availability of carbonate ions that 
are  necessary  for  calcium  carbonate  (CaCO3)  skeleton  and  shell  formation  for  a 
number of marine organisms such as corals, marine plankton, and shellfish. The ex-
tent to which the organisms are affected is largely dependent upon the calcium car-
bonate  (CaCO3)  saturation  state  (Ω),  which  is  the  product  of  the  concentrations  of 
Ca2∂ and CO3
2– divided by the apparent stoichiometric solubility product for either 
aragonite or calcite: 

Ωarag = 
Ωcal = 

[Ca∂2] [CO3
[Ca∂2] [CO3

–2]/K’sparag 
–2]/K’spcal 

(1)

where the calcium concentration is estimated from the salinity, and the carbonate 
ion  concentration  is  calculated  from  the  dissolved  inorganic  carbon  (DIC)  and  total 
alkalinity (TA) measurements.11 In regions where Ωarag or Ωcal is > 1.0 the forma-
tion  of  shells  and  skeletons  is  favored.  Below  a  value  of  1.0  the  water  is  corrosive

and  dissolution  of  pure  aragonite  and  unprotected  aragonite  shells  will  begin  to 
occur.12 Recent  studies  have  demonstrated  that  in  many  regions  of  the  ocean  the 
aragonite saturation horizon shoaled as much as 40–200 m as a direct consequence 
of  the  uptake  of  anthropogenic  CO2.3,5,6 It  is  shallowest  in  the  northeastern  Pacific 
Ocean, only 100–300 m from the ocean surface, allowing for the transport of under-
saturated waters onto the continental shelf during periods of upwelling. 

In  May  and  June  of  2007,  we  conducted  a  North  American  Carbon  Program 
(NACP)  West  Coast  Cruise  on  the  Research  Ship  Wecoma  along  the  continental 
shelf of western North America, completing a series of 13 cross-shelf transects from 
Queen  Charlotte  Sound,  Canada  to  San  Gregorio  Baja  California  Sur,  Mexico  (Fig. 
1).  Full  water  column  conductivity-temperature-depth-rosette  (CTDR)  stations  were 
occupied at specified locations along each transect (Fig. 1). Water samples were col-
lected  in  modified  Niskin-type  bottles  and  analyzed  for  DIC,  TA,  oxygen,  nutrients 
and  dissolved  and  particulate  organic  carbon.  Aragonite  and  calcite  saturation, 
pHSW, and pCO2 were calculated from the DIC and TA data.11

to  San  Gregorio  Baja  California  Sur,  Mexico.  On  transect  lines  5  the  corrosive  water  reaches 
all the way to the surface in the inshore waters near the coast. The black dots represent station 
locations. 

The central and southern coastal region off western North America is strongly in-
fluenced  by  seasonal  upwelling  which  typically  begins  in  early  spring  when  the 
Aleutian  low  pressure  system  moves  to  the  northwest  and  the  Pacific  High  moves 
northward, resulting in a strengthening of the northwesterly winds.13,14 These winds

drive  net  surface  water  Ekman  transport  offshore,  which  induces  the  upwelling  of 
CO2-rich intermediate depth (100–200 m) offshore waters onto the continental shelf. 
The upwelling lasts until late summer or fall when winter storms return. 

During  the  cruise,  various  stages  and  strengths  of  upwelling  were  observed  from 
line  2  off  central  Vancouver  Island  to  line  11  off  Baja  California,  Mexico.  We  ob-
served recent upwelling on lines 5 and 6 near the Oregon-California border. Coinci-
dent  with  the  upwelled  waters,  we  found  evidence  for  undersaturated,  low  pH  sea-
water in the bottom waters as depicted by Ωarag values < 1.0 and pH values < 7.75. 
The  corrosive  waters  reached  mid-shelf  depths  of  approximately  40–120  m  along 
lines  2–4,  and  7–13  (Fig.  1).  In  the  region  of  the  strongest  upwelling  (line  5),  the 
isolines of Ωarag = 1.0, DIC = 2190 and pH = 7.75 closely followed the 26.2 potential 
density surface (Fig. 2). This density surface shoaled from a depth of ∼150 m in the 
offshore waters and breached the surface over the shelf near the 100 m bottom con-
tour, approximately 40 km from the coast. This shoaling of the density surfaces and 
CO2-rich waters as one approaches land is typical of strong coastal upwelling condi-
tions.15-18 The  surface  water  pCO2 on  the  26.2  potential  density  surface  was  about 
850 µatm near the shelfbreak and higher inshore (Fig. 2), possibly enhanced by res-
piration  processes  on  the  shelf.17 These  results  indicate  that  the  upwelling  process 
caused  the  entire  water  column  shoreward  of  the  50  m  bottom  contour  to  become 
undersaturated  with  respect  to  aragonite,  a  condition  that  was  not  predicted  to 
occur  in  open-ocean  surface  waters  until  2050.5 On  line  6,  the  next  transect  south, 
the undersaturated water was close to the surface at approximately 22 km from the 
coast.  The  lowest  Ωarag  values  (<  0.60)  observed  in  the  near-bottom  waters  of  the 
continental shelf corresponded with pH values close to 7.5. Since the calcite satura-
tion horizon is located between 225–400 m in this part of the northeastern Pacific,19 
it is still too deep to shoal onto the continental shelf. Nevertheless, the calcite satu-
rations values drop in the core of the upwelled water (Ωcal < 1.3).

150–200  m  onto  the  shelf  and  outcropping  at  the  surface  near  the  coast.  The  black  dots  rep-
resent sample locations. 

As  noted,  the  North  Pacific  aragonite  saturation  horizons  are  among  the 
shallowest in the global ocean.3 The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has caused these 
horizons  to  shoal  by  50–100  m  since  pre-industrial  times  so  that  they  are  within 
the  density  layers  that  are  currently  being  upwelled  along  the  west  coast  of  North 
America.  Although  much  of  the  corrosive  character  of  these  waters  is  the  natural 
result  of  respiration  processes  at  intermediate  depths  below  the  euphotic  zone,  this 
region  continues  to  accumulate  more  anthropogenic  CO2 and,  therefore,  the 
upwelling  processes  will  expose  coastal  organisms  living  in  the  water  column  or  at 
the  seafloor  to  less  saturated  waters  exacerbating  the  biological  impacts  of  ocean 
acidification. 

Based on our observed O2 values and estimated O2 consumption rates on the same 
density  surfaces,20 the  upwelled  water  off  northern  California  (line  5)  was  last  at 
the surface about 50 years ago when atmospheric CO2 was about 65 ppm lower than 
today. The open ocean anthropogenic CO2 distributions in the Pacific have been esti-
mated  previously.19,4,21 By  determining  the  density-dependence  of  anthropogenic 
CO2 distributions  in  the  eastern-most  North  Pacific  stations  of  the  Sabine  et  al 21 
data set, we estimate that these upwelled waters contain approximately 31 ± 4 umol 
kg–1  anthropogenic  CO2 (fig.  S2).  Removing  this  signal  from  the  DIC  increases  the 
aragonite  saturation  state  of  the  waters  by  about  0.2  units.  Thus,  without  the  an-
thropogenic  signal,  the  equilibrium  aragonite  saturation  level  (Ωarag  =  1)  would  be 
deeper  by  about  50  m  across  the  shelf,  and  no  undersaturated  waters  would  reach 
the surface. Water already in transit to upwelling centers is carrying increasing an-
thropogenic  CO2 and  more  corrosive  conditions  to  the  coastal  oceans  of  the  future. 
Thus  the  undersaturated  waters,  which  were  mostly  a  problem  for  benthic  commu-
nities  in  the  deeper  waters  near  the  shelf  break  in  the  pre-industrial  era,  have 
shoaled  closer  to  the  surface  and  near  the  coast  because  of  the  additional  inputs  of 
anthropogenic CO2. 

These  observations  clearly  show  that  seasonal  upwelling  processes  enhance  the 
advancement  of  the  corrosive  deep  water  into  broad  regions  of  the  North  American 
western continental shelf. Since the region experiences seasonal periods of enhanced 
aragonite  undersaturation,  it  is  important  to  understand  how  the  indigenous  orga-
nisms deal with this exposure and whether or not future increases in the range and 
intensity of the corrosiveness will affect their survivorship. Presently, little is known 
about  how  this  intermittent  exposure  to  corrosive  water  might  impact  the  develop-
ment of larval, juvenile and adult stages of aragonitic calcifying organisms or finfish 
that populate the neritic and benthic environments in this region and fuel a thriving 
economy. Laboratory and mesocosm experiments show that these changes in satura-
tion state may cause significant changes in overall calcification rates for many spe-
cies  of  marine  calcifiers  including  corals,  coccolithophores,  foraminifera  and 
pteropods, which are a significant food source for local juvenile salmon.8,22-30 Similar 
decreases in calcification rates would be expected for edible mussels, clams and oys-
ters.22,31 Other  research  indicates  that  many  species  of  juvenile  fish  and  shellfish 
of significant economic importance to coastal regions are highly sensitive to higher- 
than-normal CO2 levels such that high rates of mortality are directly correlated with 
the higher CO2 levels.31,32 While comprehensive field studies of organisms and their 
response  to  sporadic  increases  in  CO2 along  the  western  North  American  coast  are 
lacking, current studies suggest that further research under field conditions is war-
ranted.  Our  results  show  for  the  first  time  that  a  large  section  of  the  North  Amer-
ican continental shelf is impacted by ocean acidification. Other continental shelf re-
gions  may  also  be  impacted  where  anthropogenic  CO2-enriched  water  is  being 
upwelled onto the shelf.

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. Sabine. 
Dr.  Klinger,  thank  you  very  much  for  being  here,  and  we  look 
forward  to  hearing  your  testimony.  I  know  we  have  some  excited 
school  children  here,  but  that  is  what  we  want.  We  want  them  to 
be excited about the oceans. We want them to be healthy in the fu-
ture so that they can continue to be excited. 

So you might have to—I think if you pull the microphone directly 

in front of you, if you can, and read your testimony.

FISHERIES SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON 

Dr.  KLINGER.  Good  morning,  and  thank  you,  Senator  Cantwell 
and Congressman Inslee, for holding this hearing on this important 
and emerging issue. Thank you also for offering me the opportunity 
to testify today. 

My  name  is  Terrie  Klinger,  and  I  am  an  Associate  Professor  in 
the School of Marine Affairs and Adjunct Associate Professor in the 
School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences at the University of Wash-
ington.  My  area  of  expertise  is  marine  ecology  and  the  application 
of natural science to policy and decisionmaking.

I serve as the Chair and Research Representative of the Olympic 
Coast  National  Marine  Sanctuary  Advisory  Council,  as  Governor 
Gregoire’s  representative  on  the  Straits  Commission,  and  as  a 
member of the San Juan County’s Climate Task Force. 

The  issue  of  climate  change  as  it  impacts  marine  ecosystems  is 
large  and  difficult,  and  it  is  made  more  challenging  by  the  recent 
recognition  that  much  of  the  carbon  dioxide  released  to  the  atmos-
phere ends up in the ocean where it causes changes in ocean chem-
istry,  and  it  profoundly  influences  the  structure  and  function  of 
marine ecosystems. 

The  projected  chemical  changes  are  likely  to  interact  with  other 
stressors—for  example,  increasing  temperature  and  low  dissolved 
oxygen—to  produce  ecological  effects  that  are  larger  and  less  pre-
dictable than the effects of any single stressor alone. 

In my testimony today, I want to do three things. I will describe 
a  few  of  the  ecosystem  changes  that  are  likely  to  occur,  using  ex-
amples  from  Puget  Sound  to  illustrate  these  changes.  I  will  then 
articulate  some  of  the  pressing  research  needs  and  will  suggest 
some  of  the  management  and  policy  responses  that  could  be  made 
at a national level. 

I  have  submitted  written  testimony  that  develops  each  of  these 
points  more  fully.  I  want  to  give  you  the  sense  of  the  scope  of  the 
problem and the urgency with which action must be taken in order 
to minimize risk to social, economic, and ecological systems. 

Changes in seawater chemistry caused by ocean acidification will 
make  it  more  difficult  for  organisms  to  form  skeletons  and  shells. 
Organisms are likely to grow more slowly, produce fewer offspring, 
suffer  greater  mortality  in  an  acidified  ocean.  Calcareous  orga-
nisms are particularly at risk, but other organisms are also vulner-
able. 

In Puget Sound, it is likely the following species, such as oysters, 
clams,  mussels,  crabs,  salmon,  and  kelp  all  will  be  negatively  im-
pacted, and it is conceivable that we will lose some of these species 
entirely  over  the  next  century.  Species  of  concern  are  also  at  risk 
such  as  the  non-calcifying  organisms.  Changes  in  the  food  web 
structure  are  likely,  and  essential  habitats  provided  by  inverte-
brates and mollusks. 

We  urgently  need  strategic  policy-relevant  research  to  help  us 
understand  the  changes  that  are  likely  to  occur.  Only  through  di-
rect  experimentation  will  we  be  able  to  parameterize  models  to 
forecast  ecosystem  change  and  to  guide  strategies  to  mitigate  im-
pacts on human health and the environment. 

Research  priorities  include  improved  capacity  for  monitoring 
chemical  and  biological  changes,  experiments  to  determine  the 
range  of  physiological  responses,  and  the  potential  for  biologic  ad-
aptation and experimentation to determine the food web and other 
ecosystem impacts. 

To perform such research, we quickly need to build capacity and 
ocean monitoring in experimental facilities. For example, the estab-
lishment  of  the  Friday  Harbor  Laboratories  as  a  sentinel  site  for 
time series measurements, combined with the creation of a new ex-
perimental facility there, could serve the Nation as a center for re-
search on ocean acidification and temperate ecosystems.

Substantial funds are required to support ocean and coastal mon-
itoring,  the  development  of  experimental  facilities,  and  the  per-
formance of the research itself. The Federal Ocean Acidification Re-
search  and  Monitoring  Act  is  a  critical  first  step  in  providing  the 
requisite funding, but additional funds must be allocated to the re-
search  community  to  perform  the  work  necessary  to  address  this 
problem in an effective and timely manner. 

The research performed must guide management and policy. For 
this  to  occur,  processes  that  integrate  science  into  decisionmaking 
must  be  developed  and  implemented.  Key  management  responses 
are  likely  to  be  more  conservative  harvest  limits,  greater  consider-
ation  of  food  web  effects,  reductions  in  other  human-induced 
stressors,  and  preservation  of  biological  diversity  and  the  capacity 
for biological adaptation. 

In  summary,  the  challenges  posed  by  climate  change  and  ocean 
acidification  are  unprecedented.  Serious  sustained  effort  must  be 
made  to  provide  policy-relevant  science  and  to  implement  policies 
that are reflective of this science and are sensitive to the rates and 
magnitudes  of  environmental  change.  Substantial  new  funding  di-
rected  to  universities  and  Federal  agencies  is  required  to  support 
essential scientific investigation. 

Creation  of  a  strategic  national  research  and  implementation 
plan  constitutes  a  critical  first  step  that  must  be  followed  by  Fed-
eral  investment  that  is  sufficient  to  support  the  informational 
needs  of  this  serious  threat  to  social,  economic,  and  ecological  sys-
tems. 

Thank you for the opportunity to speak today.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF TERRIE KLINGER,  ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR,  SCHOOL OF 
MARINE AFFAIRS;  ADJUNCT ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR,  SCHOOL OF AQUATIC AND 
FISHERIES SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON 

1. Statement of Problem 

Industrial  and  agricultural  releases  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  to  the  atmosphere 
have  accelerated  over  the  past  250  years,  with  the  result  that  levels  of  CO2 in  the 
atmosphere  now  are  higher  than  at  any  time  in  the  past  650,000  years  (Feely  et 
al.,  2008,  and  references  therein).  The  oceans  absorb  about  30  million  metric  tons 
of  this  atmospheric  CO2 daily.  Dissolution  of  atmospheric  CO2 in  seawater  causes 
the pH of seawater to decline (become more acidic) and reduces carbonate saturation 
levels.  Temperate  upwelling  systems,  high-latitude  systems,  and  urbanized  coastal 
areas  all  are  likely  to  be  substantially  impacted  by  changes  in  pH  and  carbonate 
saturation  within  the  next  few  decades.  Concerted,  sustained  efforts  must  be  made 
now to improve the state of the science and to incorporate science into decisions that 
will minimize risk to social, economic, and ecological systems. 
2. State of the Science 

The  biological  and  ecological  impacts  of  declining  pH  and  carbonate  saturation 
(jointly  referred  to  as  ‘‘ocean  acidification’’)  in  temperate  and  high-latitude  eco-
systems  are  poorly  known  but  are  predicted  to  affect  biological  processes  and  eco-
logical  interactions  across  multiple  scales  of  time  and  space  (e.g.,  Hutchins  et  al., 
2007;  Riebesell  et  al.,  2007;  Engel  et  al.,  2005;  Delille  et  al.,  2005).  Ecologically  im-
portant  species  (e.g.,  keystone  species,  foundation  species,  ecosystem  engineers)  are 
likely to be negatively impacted, causing unforeseen and undesirable changes in ma-
rine ecosystems and in the provision of goods and services to humans. Commercially 
important  species  are  among  the  species  likely  to  be  negatively  impacted,  influ-
encing  rates  of  harvest  among  wild  and  cultured  species,  ultimately  reducing  the 
availability of human food provided from the ocean. 

Biological responses to ocean acidification will vary by species. Although calcifying 
organisms (algae and animals with calcareous shells or skeletons) are considered to 
be  particularly  vulnerable  to  ocean  acidification,  non-calcifying  organisms  also  will 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Jul 24, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75204.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

15 

be  affected.  Negative  impacts  are  likely  to  include  reductions  in  growth,  reproduc-
tion, survivorship, aerobic capacity, thermal tolerance, and disease resistance. Direct 
lethal impacts will cause mortality in some marine organisms. Other organisms will 
experience  sub-lethal  impacts  that  could  have  substantial  negative  ecosystem  ef-
fects.  For  example,  sub-lethal  responses  that  have  been  observed  in  recent  experi-
ments include but are not limited to: 

• Changes  in  size:  sea  urchins  reared  under  high-CO2 conditions  were  smaller 
than urchins reared in normal sea water (G. Hofmann, UC Santa Barbara, un-
published data) 

• Changes  in  morphology:  calcified  larvae  of  sand  dollars  showed  subtle  changes 
in  morphology  when  reared  under  high-CO2 conditions.  The  observed  morpho-
logical  changes  impaired  larval  swimming  behavior,  suggesting  that  survivor-
ship and recruitment of larvae could be reduced (T. Clay and J. Kershner, Uni-
versity of Washington, unpublished data) 

• Reduced  thermal  tolerance:  calcified  larvae  of  sea  urchins  were  able  to  build 
skeletons but were less tolerant of thermal stress when reared under high-CO2 
conditions (G. Hofmann, UC Santa Barbara, unpublished data) 

• Reduced  growth  rates:  microscopic  stages  of  two  kelp  species  exhibited  slower 
growth  when  grown  under  high-CO2 conditions.  Although  preliminary,  this  re-
sult  suggests  that  kelps  and  other  non-calcified  algae  could  be  negatively  im-
pacted by ocean acidification (T. Klinger, unpublished data) 

3. Ecosystem Impacts 

Ecosystem  impacts  of  ocean  acidification  are  difficult  to  predict  given  the  current 

state of the science. Likely impacts include: 

• Changes  in  food  web  structure  and  function  (e.g.,  changes  in  the  distribution 
and  abundance  of  prey  species  and  their  predators;  increased  vulnerability  of 
prey species due to slower growth and reduced calcification) 

• Changes in species assemblages. Species that respond negatively to ocean acidi-
fication  are  likely  to  be  replaced  by  others  that  are  less  sensitive  to  changing 
ocean  chemistry.  New  assemblages  are  unlikely  to  provide  the  same  goods  and 
services that we rely on now. 

• Changes  in  the  distribution  and  abundance  of  biologically-formed  (biogenic) 
habitat.  Early  evidence  suggests  that  reef-forming  organisms,  especially  those 
with calcified skeletons, and canopy-forming kelps could be negatively impacted 
by  ocean  acidification,  with  consequences  for  other  organisms  such  as  fish  that 
utilize or depend on such habitats. 

4. Fisheries Impacts 

Impacts of ocean acidification on commercial and recreational fisheries are poorly 
known.  Impacts  are  likely  to  be  mediated  through  effects  on  growth  and  survivor-
ship of larvae and juveniles and through prey availability for all life history stages. 
Likely impacts include: 

• Changes in the distribution and abundance of target species 
• Changes in the size and condition of harvested fish and shellfish 

5. Synergistic Effects 

The  biological  and  ecological  effects  of  ocean  acidification  are  likely  to  be  exacer-
bated by increasing ocean temperature, declining concentrations of dissolved oxygen, 
and  other  physical  stressors  such  as  ultraviolet  radiation.  Synergistic  effects  can 
lead  to  unpredictable  ecological  responses  such  as  non-linear  dynamics,  thresholds, 
and tipping-points. 
6. Biological Adaptation and Evolutionary Potential 

The potential for biological adaptation to ocean acidification is poorly known. Pop-
ulations with diversity in genes that regulate response to pH and carbonate satura-
tion are more likely to persist over time than are those with little genetic diversity. 
Because we do not yet know which species or populations exhibit such genetic diver-
sity, it is essential to maintain evolutionary potential by conserving both species di-
versity  and  genetic  diversity.  The  potential  for  biological  adaptation  will  be  con-
strained by loss of biological diversity and by the rapid rate at which environmental 
change is occurring.

7. Gaps in Knowledge 

16 

Although there now exists compelling evidence that the pH of the ocean is chang-
ing due to absorption of anthropogenic CO2, our understanding of local and regional 
conditions and impacts is limited. Among the existing gaps are the following: 

• Status  and  trends  in  seawater  chemistry  (pH,  carbonate  saturation,  tempera-
ture,  dissolved  oxygen,  and  other  water  properties)  at  spatial  and  temporal 
scales relevant to regional research, management, and decision-making 
• Status and trends in local populations vulnerable to ocean acidification and the 
• Range of responses among key ecosystem elements and commercially important 
• Potential for biological adaptation; evolutionary potential 
• Non-linear  dynamics,  thresholds,  and  tipping-points  in  ecological  responses  to 

combined effects of multiple stressors

ocean acidification and multiple stressors 

8. Research Needs 

The  state  of  the  science  necessitates  that  new  research  be  conducted.  Only 
through  direct  experimentation  will  we  be  able  to  adequately  parameterize  models 
to  forecast  ecosystem  change  in  the  ocean  and  guide  strategies  to  mitigate  impacts 
on  social,  economic,  and  ecological  systems.  Effective  research  will  require  that  in-
vestigations  be  conducted  across  multiple  scales  of  organization,  from  genes  to  eco-
systems, and at appropriate time scales. Satisfying these research needs will require 
that substantial new funds are made available to the research community. Research 
priorities include but are not limited to: 

to link ecological change to chemical change 

physical properties to detect physical change as it occurs 

• More  intensive  and  extensive  monitoring  of  seawater  chemistry  and  associated 
• Improved  baseline  biological  data  to  detect  ecological  change  as  it  occurs,  and 
• Establishment of chemical and biological time-series at sentinel sites 
• Experimentation  to  characterize  physiological  responses  and  differential  gene 
expression under changing conditions and to determine the potential for biologi-
cal adaptation 
• Experimentation to determine the range of biological responses among key eco-
• Experimentation  to  determine  interactions  between  species,  including  food  web 
interactions,  under  conditions  of  ocean  acidification  and  multiple  interactive 
stressors 
• Investigations  to  identify  species  that  are:  (1)  particularly  vulnerable,  (2)  less 
vulnerable,  or  (3)  capable  of  rapid  adaptation  to  the  combined  effects  of  acidifi-
cation  and  associated  stressors.  Such  investigations  could  help  guide  strategies 
to  shift  human  uses  of  living  marine  resources  to  species  that  are  less  vulner-
able or more resistant to projected changes in seawater chemistry. 

system elements and species of commercial importance 

Seven  national  research  priorities  were  identified  by  participants  in  a  workshop 
sponsored  by  NSF,  NOAA,  and  USGS  in  April  2005  (Kleypas  et  al.,  2006).  These 
priorities, paraphrased here from the original report, are as follows:

and dissolution in organisms 

chemistry across taxonomic groups 

• Determine  the  calcification  response  to  elevated  CO2 in  benthic  and  planktonic 
• Discriminate  mechanisms  of  calcification  and  responses  to  changing  seawater 
• Determine  the  interactive  effects  of  multiple  variables  that  affect  calcification 
• Establish  clear  links  between  laboratory  experiments  and  the  natural  environ-
• Characterize diurnal and seasonal cycles in the carbonate system 
• Monitor  in  situ  calcification  and  dissolution  of  calcifiers,  with  better  character-
• Incorporate  ecological  questions  into  observations  and  experiments,  e.g.,  indi-
vidual  survivorship,  population  growth  rate,  community  structure,  and  eco-
system function.

in  October  2007  by  the  Ocean  Carbon  and  Biogeochemistry  Program  with  sponsor-

ship from NSF, NOAA, NASA, and USGS. The purpose of the workshop was to fur-
ther  refine  scoping  for  research  investigations  of  ocean  acidification.  Important  re-
search themes were phrased as questions of importance (paraphrased here): 

• What are the temporal and spatial scales of change in the carbon system of the 
global  oceans  and  what  are  the  impacts  on  biological  communities  and  eco-
systems? 
• Will  marine  organisms  adapt  or  evolve  to  tolerate  elevated  CO2 and  tempera-
• How  does  elevated  CO2 influence  calcification,  respiration,  reproduction,  settle-
• What are the effects of high CO2 on processes affecting ecosystem response and 

ment and recruitment, and remineralization in marine organisms? 

ture? If so, how? 

global feedbacks? 

9. Implications for Marine Resource Managers 

Projected  changes  in  seawater  pH  and  carbonate  saturation,  combined  with  in-
creasing  temperature  and  declining  levels  of  dissolved  oxygen,  will  require  the  at-
tention of marine resource managers. Effective management requires that processes 
integrating  science  into  decision-making  be  developed  and  implemented.  Key  man-
agement responses are likely to include: 

• More conservative limits on commercial and recreational harvest to compensate 

for losses due to acidification and associated stressors 

• Greater  consideration  of  food  web  effects  (e.g.,  consideration  of  the  abundance 
and  distribution  of  prey  species)  in  setting  harvest  limits  and  establishing  re-
building and recovery plans 

• Preservation  of  species  diversity  and  genetic  diversity  to  provide  functional  re-
dundancy  and  to  enhance  the  capacity  for  biological  adaptation  to  changes  in 
ocean chemistry 

• Protection  and  restoration  of  essential  habitat  features  and  processes  to  com-

pensate for habitat losses due to acidification and associated stressors 

• Alleviation  of  other  human-induced  stressors  (pollution,  eutrophication,  shore-
line  development,  habitat  modification)  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  to  re-
duce the effects of multiple interactive stressors and the likelihood of non-linear 
dynamical responses 

10. Conclusion 

Carbon  emissions  are  causing  changes  in  seawater  chemistry  that  are  unprece-
dented  in  the  modern  era.  Ultimately,  carbon  emissions  must  be  curbed.  At  the 
same  time,  serious  and  sustained  efforts  must  be  made  now  to  reduce  risks  associ-
ated  with  changing  ocean  chemistry.  Effective  strategies  will:  (1)  provide  policy-rel-
evant science regarding the effects of ocean acidification and associated stressors on 
marine organisms and the ecosystems they comprise; (2) implement policies that are 
reflective  of  this  science  and  are  sensitive  to  the  rates  and  magnitudes  of  environ-
mental  change;  and  (3)  adjust  policies  as  new  information  becomes  available.  Sub-
stantial  new  funding  directed  to  universities  and  Federal  agencies  is  required  to 
support  essential  scientific  investigations.  Creation  of  a  strategic  national  research 
and  implementation  plan  constitutes  a  first  important  step  that  must  be  followed 
by  Federal  investment  that  is  sufficient  to  support  the  informational  needs  of  this 
serious threat to social, economic, and ecological systems.

STATEMENT OF EDWARD L. MILES, PH.D., VIRGINIA AND 
PRENTICE BLOEDEL PROFESSOR OF MARINE STUDIES 
AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS, SCHOOL OF MARINE AFFAIRS, 

UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON 

Dr.  MILES.  Thank  you,  Senator.  Thank  you  for  your  leadership, 

and Congressman Inslee—— 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Move  it  directly—right  in  front  of  you.  It  is 

a little hard—— 

Dr. MILES. All right. Is that better? 
Senator CANTWELL. Yes, thank you. 
Dr.  MILES.  My  name  is  Edward  L.  Miles,  and  I  am  the  Virginia 
and  Prentice  Bloedel  Professor  of  Marine  Studies  and  Public  Af-
fairs  in  the  School  of  Marine  Affairs  at  the  University  of  Wash-
ington.  I  also  serve  as  Co-Director  of  the  Center  for  Science  in  the 
Earth System of the Joint Institute for the Study of Oceans and At-
mosphere,  or  JISAO,  where  I  am  the  team  leader  of  the  Climate 
Impacts  Group,  the  first  of  NOAA’s  Regional  Integrated  Sciences 
and  Assessment,  or  RISA,  teams.  Our  Climate  Impacts  Group  was 
created on July 1, 1995. 

In my—in what I have to say in the short time available, I agree 
that the major lever of solution to the problems we face lies in fun-
damental  changes  to  our  energy  systems  and  energy  policy.  But 
even  if  you  were  to  bring  that  feat  about  tomorrow  morning  in 
Washington, D.C., we will have to try to manage the consequences 
of what we have created for several centuries. And that is the focus 
I want to take. 

I  think  we  cannot  afford  to  focus  just  on  ocean  acidification,  as 
massive and as shocking as it is. I believe these problems are best 
dealt  with  by  looking  at  them  as  a  suite  of  multiple  stressors  so 
let me at least list them. 

The fact is that unprotected fossil fuel emissions since they were 
introduced  have  increased  the  concentration  of  CO2 in  the  atmos-

years.  As  a  result,  as  has  already  been  mentioned,  ocean  pH  has 
been reduced by about 10 percent. But much more is implied in the 
future  as  a  result  of  the  total  commitment  of  greenhouse  gases  to 
the  atmosphere  and  the  time  scale  of  the  exchanges  between  the 
ocean and the atmosphere. 

We  also  know,  as  has  been  pointed  out,  that  ocean  acidification 
impacts the health of calcareous life forms, and this will affect the 
web  of  life  in  the  ocean,  causing  changes  to  be  felt  all  the  way  up 
the food chain and also in the other relations. 

But  we  move  on  to  other  massive  changes.  Significant  thermal 
increases in the surface and subsurface deep in the world’s oceans, 
which  will  produce  large-scale  biogeographical  shifts  in  the  dis-
tribution of the most important species which are targeted by glob-
al  commercial  fisheries  on  which  humans  depend  as  a  source  of 
animal protein. 

There  is  also  the  significantly  increased  melt  rates  of  polar  ice 
shields  in  the  summer  as  a  result  of  the  unexpected  feedback  be-
tween  the  subsurface  heat  increases  and  the  subsurface  ice,  which 
produce the increased probability of intensified stratification in the 
water  column.  Stratification  means  a  less  biologically  productive 
ocean. 

So  this  suite  of  five  new  problems,  combined  scientifically  with 
two  old  problems  which  we  haven’t  solved—that  is,  that  those  are 
the  increased  intensities  of  land-based  pollution  of  the  coastal  re-
gion  and  the  weakened  condition  of  commercial  fish  populations, 
very significant levels of overfishing have occurred. 

So  nobody  alive  is  able  to  deal  with  this  suite  of  seven  stressors 
simultaneously.  But  a  group  of  us  in  the  community  have  decided 
to  try  to  merge  our  capabilities  to  focus  on  at  least  two  of  the  big 
ones, ocean acidification and changing ocean thermal structure. 

And  together,  with  a  colleague  in  the  School  of  Oceanography, 
Professor Chris Sabine, and Dr. Richard Feely from NOAA PMEL, 
we  have  decided  to  put  together  a  larger  group,  a  panel  launched 
on  April  23  and  24,  2007,  where  we  came  to  complete  agreement 
on  the  research  which  encompasses  both  the  natural  science  and 
the policy and management issues. 

The assets we are combining consist of NOAA PMEL, the North-
west  Fishery  Science  Center,  the  Alaska  Fishery  Science  Center, 
the  School  of  Oceanography,  School  of  Aquatic  and  Fishery 
Sciences, School of Marine Affairs at the University of Washington, 
the  Center  for  the  Study  of  Earth  Science  at  the  University  of 
Washington,  and  Friday  Harbor  Labs,  and  the  National  Conserva-
tion Biology Institute. 

Our  first  step  is  to  design  a  mesocosm,  an  experimental  facility 
at Friday Harbor Lab, and to offer it as a national facility. And Dr. 
Klinger will design a workshop, which will be held this summer in 
late  August,  and  that  is  supported  by  the  Educational  Foundation 
of  America  and  the  Dean  of  the  College  of  Aquatic  and  Fishery 
Sciences and Government. 

We  have  begun  a  fund-raising  effort  for  the  construction  of  the 
mesocosm  by  doing  the  substantive  research  and  for  conducting  a 
public  education  program.  We  cannot  solve  this  set  of  problems  by 
focusing only on the Northeast Pacific, and so we hope to relate our

efforts  to  those  in  the  North  Atlantic,  the  Northwest  Pacific,  and 
elsewhere. 

As  for  global  and  national  focus,  we  are  also  involved  with  the 
Heinz  Center  in  Washington,  D.C.,  and  the  Joint  Global  Change 
Research Institute at the University of Maryland. 

Thank you very much, Senator Cantwell. 
[The prepared statement of Dr. Miles follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF EDWARD L.  MILES,  PH.D.,  VIRGINIA AND PRENTICE 
BLOEDEL PROFESSOR OF MARINE STUDIES AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS,  SCHOOL OF 
MARINE AFFAIRS, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON 
My  name  is  Edward  L.  Miles  and  I  am  the  Virginia  and  Prentice  Bloedel  Pro-
fessor  of  Marine  Studies  and  Public  Affairs  in  the  School  of  Marine  Affairs  at  the 
University  of  Washington.  In  addition,  I  hold  a  joint  appointment  in  the  Evans 
School  of  Public  Affairs  and  an  Adjunct  Appointment  in  the  School  of  Aquatic  and 
Fisheries Sciences. I also serve as Co-Director of the Center for Science in the Earth 
System  (CSES)  of  the  Joint  Institute  for  the  Study  of  Oceans  and  Atmosphere 
(JISAO), where I am the team leader of the Climate Impacts Group (CIG), the first 
of  NOAA’s  Regional  Integrated  Sciences  Assessment  (RISA)  teams.  The  CIG  was 
created on July 1, 1995. 

The Committee has asked me to address the following issues: 

1.  Summarize  the  work  of  the  Climate  Impacts  Group  and  explain  how  this 
work  enables  an  understanding  of  climate  change  and  its  effects  on  Washing-
ton’s marine and coastal ecosystems. 
2.  Discuss  the  integrated  approach  that  interest  groups  in  Washington  have 
taken to understand and adapt to climate change. 
3.  Describe  specifically  how  the  University  of  Washington,  the  Pacific  Marine 
Environmental  Lab,  the  state  of  Washington,  and  local  communities  are  work-
ing together to address climate change issues. 
4.  Discuss  the  implications  of  climate  change  for  coastal  and  ocean  resource 
managers and the needs of managers to effectively respond to the resulting im-
pacts. 

Since  it  will  not  be  possible  to  respond  to  all  these  questions  orally  in  the  time 
allotted to me, I shall respond in my written statement provided in the record and, 
for my oral presentation, I shall present the challenges which climate change poses 
to  the  region’s  oceans  and  coasts  and  focus  on  the  new  and  very  serious  problem 
we now face in the world ocean as a whole. This is the problem of ocean acidification 
combined with a changing ocean thermal structure. 
The Work of the CIG 

The CSES consists of the Climate Dynamics Group (CDG) and the CIG as a com-
pletely integrated ‘‘one-stop-shop’’. The CDG studies the physical climate system rel-
evant to the Pacific Northwest and the CIG examines the impacts of climate varia-
bility and change on the Pacific Northwest, and produces climate information prod-
ucts and derived predictions (e.g., streamflow forecasts) for a large set of local stake-
holders. 

Formed  as  a  spin-off  of  Miles’  experience  in  the  Second  Assessment  of  the  Inter-
governmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  in  1994–1995,  the  CIG  focuses  on 
developing  climate  impacts  science  as  the  study  of  how  climate,  natural  resources, 
and  human  socio-economic  systems  affect  each  other.  This  requires  the  integration 
of  physical  and  social  science  research,  as  well  as  the  integration  of  stakeholders’ 
perspectives (Federal, state, tribal, local, private sector, and NGO’s). 

With  core  support  from  NOAA,  we  focus  on  four  sectors:  the  regional  hydrology/ 
water  resources  management,  forest  ecosystems,  aquatic  ecosystems  (primarily 
salmonids  and  the  ecosystem  structures  and  fisheries  of  Puget  Sound  and  the 
Northern California Current System, including the coastal zones of Washington and 
Oregon). We study the dynamics of climate variability as a basis for making projec-
tions of likely scenarios of climate change.

Integration  of 

in 

Understanding and Adapting to Climate Change 

How  we  got  to  where  we  are  now  can  be  described  as  a  series  of  steps.  It  is  an 

evolutionary unfolding rather than the result of a deliberate strategic plan.

21 

1.  We  began  with  an  initial  focus  on  understanding  climate  variability  in  the 
PNW  and  impacts  across  the  four  sectors.  We  shared  the  results  of  our  inves-
tigations  with  stakeholders  from  1995–1997  in  general  annual  meetings  of  de-
clining utility. 
2.  1997–1998  was  a  year  of  transition  defined  by  two  major  experiences.  These 
were the First National Assessment of climate change impacts on the U.S., con-
ceived  and  implemented  in  the  Clinton  Administration  by  then  Vice  President 
Al  Gore,  and  the  most  intense  El  Nin˜ o  of  the  20th  century.  The  latter  event 
generated intense interest in climate which was sustained by widespread media 
coverage. With combined additional investment from NOAA and UW to expand 
the  outreach  capacity  of  the  CIG,  we  hired  Dr.  Philip  Mote  to  be  our  2nd  cli-
mate dynamicist, focused on the general circulation models (GCMs) of IPCC and 
CIG  specialist  in  charge  of  outreach.  In  addition,  we  shifted  to  custom-made 
workshops  for  interest  groups  across  the  four  sectors.  CIG  emphasis  was  then 
equal  between  climate  variability  and  climate  change;  currently  we  place  a 
heavier  emphasis  on  issues  related  to  climate  change.  Between  2000  and  2005 
we  expanded  our  contacts  with  stakeholders  and  deepened  our  connections  to 
those who had joined us early. 
3.  A  new  threshold  was  crossed  as  a  result  of  increasingly  observed  effects  of 
climate  change  combined  with  exercise  of  leadership  by  NE  states,  California, 
the  Chief  Executive  of  King  Co.,  the  Mayor  of  Seattle,  and  the  Tri-State  Gov-
ernor’s  Initiative  involving  California,  Oregon,  and  Washington  by  2004.  In 
2005 we participated in a highly successful collaboration between King Co. and 
the CIG in the form of a workshop for >700 people in Quest Field covering eight 
sectors  of  the  PNW.  Collaboration  with  King  Co.  continued  in  the  design  and 
preparation of an adaptation Guidebook for Local Governments and on joint re-
search  projects.  Research  results  began  to  support  policy  development  at  this 
stage. 
4. In 2007–2008 collaboration occurred between the CIG, the Washington Legis-
lature,  and  the  Governor’s  Initiative  on  Climate  Change.  Agreement  converged 
on  an  eight-sector  assessment  of  likely  climate  change  impacts  (H.B.  1303  and 
2860).  This  initiative  is  overseen  jointly  by  the  Division  of  Community,  Trade, 
and  Economic  Development  (CTED)  of  the  Office  of  the  Governor  and  Wash-
ington  Dept.  of  Ecology.  An  increasingly  close  and  very  effective  collaboration 
between CIG and Ecology has emerged across all areas. 

Collaboration  between  UW,  NOAA/PMEL,  NMFS  Northwest  Fisheries 
Science  Center,  NMFS  Alaska  Fisheries  Science  Center,  and  Local 
Communities to Address Climate Change Issues 

The University of Washington has very great strengths in the earth sciences and 
particularly so on matters related to climate dynamics, climate impacts, and climate 
change. This expertise is distributed across the following units: 

1.  The  Program  on  Climate  Change  (PCC)  combines  as  core  units  the  School 
of Oceanography, Dept. of Atmospheric Sciences, and Dept. of Earth and Space 
Sciences. The principal foci are research, education, and outreach. PCC also in-
volves the Quaternary Research Center, the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), 
JISAO,  the  CIG,  and  NOAA’s  Pacific  Marine  Environmental  Laboratory 
(PMEL). http://www.uwpcc.washington.edu/ 
2.  JISAO  is  a  ‘‘center  of  excellence’’  fostering  collaboration  between  NOAA  and 
UW on research themes which are allied with NOAA’s strategic plan. These in-
clude  climate,  environmental  chemistry,  marine  ecosystems,  and  coastal  ocean-
ography.  http://jisao.washington.edu  The  CSES/CIG  is  also  based  in  JISAO. 
http://cses.washington.edu 

Examples of the ways in which these organizations combine and recombine to deal 
with  problems  of  climate  impacts  would  include  collaboration  between  CSES  and 
the NMFS Northwest Fisheries Science Center on the investigation of harmful algal 
blooms  in  Puget  Sound;  on  improving  rebuilding  plans  for  overfished  West  Coast 
rockfish stocks through inclusion of climate information; on modeling studies to sup-
port  conservation  planning  for  Pacific  Salmon;  on  developing  quantitative  tools  for 
evaluating the effects of climate change on the population dynamics of Pacific salm-
on; and on predicting the responses of wild Pacific salmon to climate change. 

Another  area  of  activity  which  was  launched  in  April  2007,  concerns  the  com-
prehensive investigation of the impacts of changing ocean thermal structure and in-
creasing  acidification  in  the  Northeast  Pacific  Ocean.  This  effort  integrates  the  ef-
forts of CSES, UW School of Oceanography, School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences 
(SAFS),  School  of  Marine  Affairs  (SMA),  and  Friday  Harbor  Laboratories  (FHL)

with  NOAA/PMEL,  the  Northwest  Fisheries  Science  Center,  the  Alaska  Fisheries 
Science  Center,  and  the  Marine  Conservation  Biology  Institute.  The  workshop  es-
tablished  a  priority  for  building  a  mesocosm  at  FHL  as  a  national  facility  for  the 
purpose of conducting experiments on the impacts of ocean acidification and agreed 
on a Steering Committee to move the programming forward. Since then the Steering 
Committee  has  secured  a  grant  from  the  Educational  Foundation  of  America  com-
bined  with  a  contribution  from  Dean  Arthur  Nowell  to  hold  a  workshop  to  produce 
a  detailed  design  for  the  mesocosm.  The  Steering  Committee  is  currently  engaged 
in developing a fundraising effort for constructing a mesocosm as well as for begin-
ning  a  substantive  research  program,  the  first  steps  of  which  have  been  outlined. 
These  investigations  will  be  conducted  in  an  ‘‘end-to-end’’  mode  involving  funda-
mental and applied science connected to identification and evaluation of alternative 
approaches to mitigation of and adaptation to the combined problem drivers of acidi-
fication and changing ocean thermal structure. 

Linked  to,  but  going  substantially  beyond  the  acidification  problem  is  an  activity 
that  combines  the  strengths  of  NOAA/PMEL  with  APL  at  UW  and  King  County  to 
determine  a  regional  carbon  budget  for  the  Seattle  area.  A  comprehensive  plan  is 
now  being  developed  in  the  form  of  a  White  Paper.  However,  even  before  the  plan 
is  finished,  NOAA/PMEL  has  collected  carbon  samples  from  a  winter  cruise  con-
ducted by the PRISM Program at UW. More samples will be collected this summer 
to get a first look at the carbon budget of Puget Sound. As a first step in the imple-
mentation  of  a  continuous  monitoring  system,  PMEL  has  emplaced  a  CO2 mooring 
off Aberdeen, WA, for the purpose of measuring surface water and atmospheric CO2. 
This mooring has been operating for the last 2 years. These tentative steps are very 
important for a number of reasons. As local governments seek to reduce their emis-
sions  of  CO2 they  will  need  to  develop  the  capability  to  verify  that  policies  enacted 
are  reducing  emissions  as  intended.  This  capability  requires  an  in-depth  under-
standing  of  sources  and  sinks  of  the  gases  which  are  targeted  for  reduction.  That 
understand would be substantially enlarged by a monitoring system such as the one 
being  designed  in  the  collaboration  between  NOAA/PMEL,  UW/APL,  and  King  Co. 
Of  the  eight  sectors  identified  in  the  H.B.  1303  investigation,  two  involve  ocean 
problems. These are Coasts, Estuaries, Harbors, Salmon and Marine Ecosystems. In 
the  former  category,  the  legislation  requires  CIG  and  its  partners  to  estimate  to 
what  extent  rising  sea  levels  and  ocean  temperatures  will  impact  the  coasts,  estu-
aries,  and  harbors  of  the  State  of  Washington  through  inundation,  increased  flood-
ing, and/or erosion. In the latter case, the legislation requires assessment of the ex-
tent to which climate change will alter the state’s streams for salmonids, and where 
and  under  what  conditions  is  salmonid  habitat  most  vulnerable  to  direct  (rising 
water temperatures) and indirect (habitat) effects of climate change. 
The  Implications  of  Climate  Change  for  Ocean  and  Coastal  Resource 
Managers  and  the  Needs  of  Managers  to  Respond  Effectively  to  the 
Resulting Impacts 

Challenges Posed by Climate Change in the Pacific Northwest: 

1.  Changing  ocean  thermal  structure  (increasing  surface  and  sub-surface  heat) 
inducing  large-scale  biogeographic  shifts  of  ecosystems,  including  commercial 
fisheries. 
2.  Increasing  ocean  acidification  in  both  the  North  Pacific  Ocean  and  particu-
larly  in  the  coastal  ocean  off  the  West  Coast  of  North  America  with  negative 
results  for  all  species  requiring  calcium  carbonate  for  building  their  skeletons 
and unknown effects for fisheries. 
3.  Increasing  stratification  of  the  water  column  as  a  result  of  changing  ocean 
thermal  structure,  accentuated  by  increased  input  of  freshwater  from  melting 
glaciers. 
4. Expanding areal extent of oligotrophic gyres (i.e., waters rich in dissolved ox-
ygen, but lacking nutrients and plant life). 
5.  Salmon,  and  salmon  restoration  programs  affected  by  multiple  stresses  con-
necting both terrestrial and marine dimensions of the life cycle from watersheds 
to the open ocean. 
6. Harmful algal blooms. 
7. Coastal hypoxia. 
8.  Changes  in  the  frequency  and  predictability  of  fisheries  recruitment  events 
as a result of cascading changes in the marine environment. 
9.  Very  complex,  but  largely  unknown,  changes  in  nearshore  structural  algae 
(eelgrass, kelp) as habitat for a wide range of coastal fish species.

10. Changes in the magnitude and type of coastal hazards generated by varying 
levels of sea level rise and the ways these changes will impact coastal develop-
ment and public infrastructure. 

Managerial Needs: 

1. Increased information derived from expansions in monitoring capacity in the 
open and coastal ocean and Puget Sound. 
2. Research and assessment tied to policy development. 
3.  Systematic  evaluation  of  potential  alternative  suites  of  policy  options  to  re-
spond effectively to severe problems of multiple stresses in a changing environ-
ment. 

In  summary,  over  the  past  13  years  the  CSES  has  engaged  in  a  wide  range  of 
issue-driven  scientific  research  and  outreach  related  to  the  coasts  and  marine 
waters of the Pacific Northwest region. The region’s needs for improved information 
and  decision-support  tools  for  managing  marine  resources  is  great,  and  threats 
posed  by  future  climate  change  and  ocean  acidification  will  likely  amplify  existing 
decision-support needs in the very near future. 

Senator CANTWELL. Well, thank you, Dr. Miles. 
Dr.  Koenings,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  being  here,  and  we  look 
forward  to  hearing  your  views.  Thank  you  for  representing  the 
State of Washington. 

STATEMENT OF JEFFREY P. KOENINGS, PH.D., DIRECTOR, 

DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE, 

STATE OF WASHINGTON 

Dr.  KOENINGS.  Thank  you  very  much.  Good  morning,  Senator 

Cantwell and Representative Inslee. 

I  am  Dr.  Jeff  Koenings,  Director  of  the  Washington  Department 
of  Fish  and  Wildlife.  I  also  wear  a  variety  of  other  hats  as  Chair 
of the National Pacific Salmon Commission and a Council Member 
of both the Pacific Fishery Management Council and the North Pa-
cific Fishery Management Council. 

I appreciate this opportunity to speak to you on the impact of cli-
mate  change  on  Washington  State’s  marine  ecosystems.  For  re-
source  managers,  I  can  sum  up  this  topic  with  one  word,  and  that 
word is ‘‘uncertainty.’’ 

When  we  embark  on  a  discussion  of  global  climate  change  im-
pacts, let us first acknowledge that we are heading into uncharted 
territory.  Unlike  other  areas  of  natural  resource  science  and  man-
agement, we have no body of research to guide us, no historic mod-
els  to  foreshadow  the  shape  of  things  to  come,  no  proven  formulas 
to follow. 

As a natural resource manager, I depend on science to guide my 
decisions, and in this arena, the science is just beginning to be de-
veloped.  All  this  translates  to  the  need  for  precautionary  resource 
management. The climate change is, indeed, upon us all. 

What  we  do  know  is  that  climate  change  has  the  potential  for 
enormous  direct  impact  on  delicate  coastal  ecosystems,  as  well  as 
leaving  them  more  vulnerable  to  secondary  stressors.  Changing 
ocean water temperatures, currents, stratification patterns, acidifi-
cation  can  lead  to  other  changes  we  are  only  beginning  to  con-
template. 

With  so  much  unknown,  we  must  gather  intelligence  from  a 
growing number of the abnormal and even bizarre events that sig-
nal  the  natural  and  economic  catastrophe  climate  change  could 
bring.  A  growing  oxygen-depleted  dead  zone  has  appeared  in  the

ocean  off  our  coast.  Non-native  species,  such  as  the  giant  Pacific 
squid,  make  sudden  appearances  in  our  waters,  and  this  year,  en-
tire salmon runs have collapsed in Oregon and California. 

We need no crystal ball to see the economic toll the salmon fish-
ery  collapse  has  taken  on  the  West  Coast.  An  unprecedented  $60 
million in Federal funds has been distributed since last summer to 
some  1,200  commercial  fishermen  in  Oregon  and  California.  The 
shadow  cast  on  coastal  communities,  on  operators  of  hotels,  res-
taurants,  charter  boats,  convenience  stores,  and  supply  shops  is 
even wider. 

Here  in  Washington  State,  our  severely  constrained  fishery  is 
projected  to  eat  away  nearly  $14  million  from  the  sport  fisheries, 
$15  million  from  the  other  salmon-related  businesses,  and  another 
$7.2 million in direct losses to commercial fishers. 

This  year,  the  Chinook  salmon  disaster  offers  a  window  on  how 
the destruction of a single species, much less entire ecosystems, re-
verberates  through  our  communities.  It  sounds  like  an  extreme 
wake-up call for us all. 

I  would  like  to  briefly  outline  three  ways  marine  areas  could  be 
particularly  affected  by  climate  change—first,  through  ocean  dead 
zones; second, through non-native invasive species; and third, from 
the cumulative impacts to salmon and steelhead. 

Scientists  have  yet  to  determine  how  closely  ocean  dead  zones 
are  linked  to  climate  change,  but  we  do  know  the  oceanic  and  at-
mospheric  conditions  that  create  these  areas  are  consistent  with 
climate  change  predictions.  In  recent  years,  these  zones  of  oxygen- 
starved  water  off  the  coast  of  Washington  and  Oregon  are  per-
sisting  longer  and  becoming  more  severely  with  depleted  oxygen. 
By  last  year,  the  coastal  dead  zone  had  spread  from  Washington 
coast to the California border. 

Even  absent  the  great  uncertainties  of  climate  change,  non-na-
tive,  potentially  invasive  species  dispersed  by  ship  ballast  water 
are  among  the  top  threats  to  the  world’s  marine  ecosystems.  With 
the  emergence  of  modern  shipping,  the  natural  barriers  have  been 
broken  down,  allowing  the  introduction  of  alien  species  that  upset 
the  equilibrium  of  native  ecosystems.  Climate  change  could  usher 
even more invasive animals and plants into our marine waters. 

I  am  pleased  to  report  that  Washington  State  enforces  ballast 
water management requirements. Improper ballast water discharge 
in  State  waters  is  subject  to  civil  penalties.  And,  yes,  we  have  in-
voked  those  penalties  a  half  dozen  times  over  the  past  few  years. 
The  passage  of  Federal  ballast  water  legislation  with  necessary 
standards will greatly help these efforts. 

Besides the general threat from ballast water, we are also aware 
of  specific  invaders  that  threaten  wide-scale  havoc  in  our  marine 
ecosystem  and  our  economy.  Just  two  invasive  species,  the  green 
crab and the Chinese mitten crab, could overrun our native Dunge-
ness  crab,  thus  disrupting  the  State’s  most  lucrative  coastal  fish-
ery. 

In no area of State fishery management are the potential effects 
of  climate  change  more  sobering  than  for  salmon  and  steelhead.

system  to  complete  their  life  cycle,  making  them  particularly  vul-

nerable  to  flood  events,  competing  water  demands,  and  tempera-
ture  changes,  all  expected  to  increase  with  the  changing  climate. 
Given  the  uncertainty  of  what  lies  ahead,  the  common  denomi-
nator  in  all  these  concerns  is  the  need  for  precautionary  resource 
management. Faced with great unknowns, our best hope is to take 
the best possible care of the resources we still have. 

It is difficult to consider climate change impact without becoming 
overwhelmed. However, we can find some cause for optimism in an 
evolving  spirit  of  cooperation  as  we  face  our  shared  burden,  and 
you see some of that in front of you today. 

There are also very collaborative people behind me that are here 
attending  this  hearing.  [Inaudible]  All  are  involved  in  a  collabo-
rative  effort  to  address  ecosystem  problems  we  have  here  in  the 
State of Washington. 

But  first,  I  would  like  to  share  one  recent  example  of  collabo-
rative effort. Just days ago, the United States and Canada reached 
agreement on a new salmon harvest plan under the Pacific Salmon 
Treaty.  Over  the  next  10  years,  this  ground-breaking  agreement 
will return a million more salmon to Northwest waters. This treaty 
offers a unique opportunity to pursue precautionary resource man-
agement on a far-reaching and long-lasting scale. 

The  kind  of  large-scale  commitment  and  cooperation  exemplified 
in  the  Pacific  Salmon  Treaty  among  nations,  among  agencies,  and 
among  citizens  must  be  the  cornerstone  for  any  concrete  effort  to 
tackle  climate  change.  In  this  arena,  the  past  is  not  served  but  is 
a  prelude  to  the  future.  Instead,  we  are  faced  with  unknown  chal-
lenges  of  monumental  proportions.  We  must  move  forward  with 
only  the  tools  that  offer  hope—our  shared  concern,  our  willingness 
to collaborate, and our combined commitment to conservation. 

Thank you, and I will be happy to answer any questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEFFREY P. KOENINGS, PH.D., DIRECTOR, 

DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE, STATE OF WASHINGTON 

Good morning, Senator Cantwell and honorable Committee members. I’m Dr. Jeff 
Koenings,  Director  of  the  Washington  State  Department  of  Fish  and  Wildlife.  I  ap-
preciate this opportunity to speak to you on the impacts of climate change on Wash-
ington  State’s  marine  ecosystem.  I  can  sum  up  this  topic  with  one  word—uncer-
tainty! 

When  we  embark  on  a  discussion  of  global  climate  change  impacts,  let’s  first  ac-
knowledge that we are heading into uncharted territory. Unlike other areas of nat-
ural-resource  science  and  management,  we  have  no  body  of  research  to  guide  us, 
no  historic  models  to  foreshadow  the  shape  of  things  to  come,  no  proven  formulas 
to follow. 

Given  this  uncertainty,  Washington  state  has  embarked  on  several  collaborative 
efforts to assess and begin planning for the potential impacts of climate change. The 
University of Washington Climate Impacts Group, part of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric  Administration’s  Regional  Integrated  Sciences  and  Assessment  (RISA) 
network, the Western Governor’s Association Climate Initiatives work group and the 
Washington  State  Climate  Challenge  all  offer  the  kind  of  broad-based  forums  that 
will be required to respond to climate change. 

We do know that climate change has the potential for enormous direct impact on 
delicate  coastal  ecosystems,  as  well  as  leaving  them  more  vulnerable  to  secondary 
stressors. Changing ocean water temperatures, currents, and stratification can lead 
to other changes we are only beginning to contemplate. As you know, impacts asso-
ciated  with  climate  change  and  climate  variability  are  difficult  to  distinguish  from 
other forces that stress the marine ecosystem. 

With  so  much  unknown,  we  must  gather  intelligence  from  a  growing  number  of 
abnormal, even bizarre, events that signal the natural and economic catastrophe cli-

mate  change  could  bring  to  our  waters.  Since  2002,  a  growing,  oxygen-depleted 
ocean ‘‘dead zone’’ ocean has appeared and grown off our coast. Periodically non-na-
tive species such as the giant Pacific squid make sudden appearances in our waters. 
And this year, entire salmon runs have collapsed in Oregon and California. 

We  need  no  crystal  ball  to  see  the  economic  toll  the  salmon  fishery  collapse  has 
taken  on  the  West  Coast.  An  unprecedented  $60  million  in  Federal  funds  has  been 
distributed  since  last  summer  to  some  1,200  commercial  fishermen  in  Oregon  and 
California.  The  shadow  cast  on  coastal  communities—business  lost  to  hotels,  res-
taurants,  charter  operators,  convenience  stores  and  supply  shops—is  even  wider. 
And even though we in Washington state are fortunate to have some fishing oppor-
tunity this year, our severely constrained fishery is projected to eat away nearly $14 
million  in  revenues  from  sport  fisheries,  $15  million  in  lost  revenue  to  businesses 
that  provide  goods  and  services  that  support  fisheries,  and  another  $7.2  million  in 
direct losses to commercial fishers. 

This  year’s  chinook  salmon  disaster  offers  a  window  on  how  the  disruption  of  a 
single  species  reverberates  throughout  our  communities.  It  also  sounds  a  wake-up 
call. Because as difficult as this year’s events are for our West Coast neighbors, this 
state, with its miles of complex marine coastline—bays, estuaries, great coastal riv-
ers  and,  of  course,  Puget  Sound—is  potentially  even  more  vulnerable  to  climate 
change. 

I’d like to briefly outline three ways our marine areas are particularly vulnerable 
to climate change—first, through growing, oxygen-deprived ocean ‘‘dead zones;’’ sec-
ond, from the appearance of non-native, invasive species; and third, from cumulative 
impacts  to  salmon  and  steelhead  as  they  move  throughout  freshwater  and  marine 
ecosystems to complete their life cycle. 

Scientists  have  yet  to  determine  how  closely  oxygen-deprived  ocean  dead  zones 
are  linked  to  climate  change.  But  we  do  know  the  oceanic  and  atmospheric  condi-
tions  that  create  these  areas  are  consistent  with  climate  change  predictions.  These 
zones of oxygen-starved water—historically found only on the sea floor and the outer 
areas  of  the  continental  shelf—in  2002  began  appearing  much  closer  to  the  coasts 
of  Oregon  and  Washington,  persisting  longer,  and  becoming  more  severely  oxygen 
depleted. We also know that the longer they persist, the greater the impact on fish, 
crab  and  other  marine  life.  By  last  year,  the  coastal  dead  zone  that  appeared  only 
in 2002, had spread to extend from Washington to the California border. 

Even  absent  the  great  uncertainties  of  climate  change,  non-native,  potentially 
invasive  species  dispersed  by  ship  ballast  water  discharges  are  among  the  top 
threats  to  the  world’s  marine  ecosystems.  For  thousands  of  years,  marine  species 
could  spread  only  by  drifting  on  current  or  debris.  With  the  emergence  of  the  mod-
ern shipping and growing trade between nations, natural barriers have been broken 
down, allowing the introduction of alien species that upset the equilibrium of native 
ecosystems. A recent report by the Environmental Protection Agency calls on states 
to  consider  the  effect  of  climate  change  on  the  already-challenging  issue  of  aquatic 
invasive  species,  to  identify  ecosystem  vulnerabilities,  and  to  evaluate  and  improve 
controls. 

Although  there  is  much  to  be  done  to  meet  this  growing  challenge,  I’m  pleased 
to  report  that  Washington  state  has  enforced  ballast  water  management  require-
ments on all vessels of three hundred gross tons or more, domestic or foreign. Vessel 
operators  are  required  to  ensure  that  ballast  water  is  exchanged  at  sea  or  treated 
before it is discharged into state waters, and to report discharges. Improper ballast 
water  discharges  into  state  waters  are  subject  to  civil  penalties.  And  yes,  we  have 
invoked those penalties a half-dozen times in the past several years. 

Besides the general threat from ballast water, we are also aware of specific invad-
ers that threaten wide-scale havoc in our marine ecosystem and our state’s economy. 
Just two invasive species—the green crab and the Chinese mitten crab—could over-
run our native Dungeness crab, disrupting this state’s most lucrative coastal fishery. 
In no area of state fishery management are the potential effects of climate change 
more sobering than for salmon and steelhead. That’s because these iconic Northwest 
species  move  throughout  our  entire  ecosystem—beginning  life  in  inland  spawning 
streams, migrating down major river systems, sheltering along estuaries and coast-
lines,  finally  heading  out  to  sea  and  then  repeating  their  journey  homeward—to 
complete  their  life  cycle.  With  such  a  wide  range,  they  are  particularly  vulnerable 
to  flood  events,  competing  water  demands  and  temperature  changes—all  expected 
to  increase  with  a  changing  climate.  Because  salmon  and  steelhead  rely  on  clean, 
cool  water  for  survival,  and  require  undisturbed  streambeds  to  produce  offspring, 
entire  runs  can  be  threatened  by  water  flow  disruptions.  Those  disruptions  include 
flooding such as we’ve seen this past winter and the one before it, as well as warm 
season  low  flows  that  can  strand  young  fish  en  route  to  the  ocean,  or  block  the  re-
turn of adult salmon headed back to their native streams to spawn. This year’s col-

lapse  of  California’s  Sacramento  River  and  Oregon’s  Klamath  River  salmon  runs 
may offer the most detailed picture to date of the consequences of water-supply dis-
ruption. 

Given  the  uncertainty  of  what  lies  ahead,  the  common  denominator  in  all  these 
concerns  is  the  need  for  precautionary  resource  management.  Faced  with  great  un-
knowns, our best hope is to take the best possible care of the resources we still have. 
It’s  difficult  to  consider  climate  change  impacts  without  becoming  overwhelmed. 
However,  we  can  find  some  cause  for  optimism  in  an  evolving  spirit  of  cooperation 
as  we  face  our  shared  burden.  I’d  like  to  share  one  recent  example.  Just  days  ago, 
the  United  States  and  Canada  reached  agreement  on  a  new  salmon-harvest  plan, 
under  the  Pacific  Salmon  Treaty.  Over  the  next  10  years,  this  groundbreaking 
agreement will return a million more salmon to Northwest waters. For example, the 
annual  catch  of  chinook  in  southeast  Alaska  will  be  reduced  by  15  percent.  Off  the 
west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia will lower its annual chinook har-
vest  by  30  percent.  Many  of  the  salmon  spared  will  return  to  Washington  waters, 
furthering  the  recovery  of  fish  populations  listed  for  protection  under  the  Federal 
Endangered Species Act. 

I  can  assure  you  that  with  this  conservation-based  agreement  we  are  making  a 
substantial  down  payment  toward  recovery  of  Washington’s  weak,  wild,  chinook 
salmon  populations.  This  is  a  unique  opportunity  to  pursue  precautionary  resource 
management on a far-reaching and long-lasting scale. 

We can find other models of the kind of all-hands work needed to take on climate 
change  issues.  Right  here  in  the  Puget  Sound  region,  a  partnership  established  by 
Governor  Gregoire  is  bringing  governments  on  all  levels  together  to  restore  the 
health  of  the  Sound  within  a  decade.  On  another  front,  my  agency  is  working  with 
scientists,  tribes  and  legislators  to  completely  retool  our  state’s  aging  hatchery  sys-
tem—one of the world’s largest—to support wild salmon recovery. 

The  kind  of  large-scale  commitment  and  cooperation  exemplified  in  the  Pacific 
Salmon  Treaty—among  nations,  among  agencies,  among  citizens—must  be  the  cor-
nerstone  of  any  concrete  effort  to  tackle  the  sweeping  challenge  of  climate  change. 
Unlike  so  many  other  concerns  of  government  where  the  past  is  prelude  to  the  fu-
ture,  in  this  arena  we  are  faced  with  unknown  challenges  of  monumental  propor-
tions.  We  go  forward  with  the  only  tools  that  offer  hope—our  shared  concern,  our 
willingness to collaborate, and our combined commitment to conservation. 

Thank  you.  If  there  are  any  questions,  I’ll  be  happy  to  try  to  provide  you  with 

a concise answer. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Dr. Koenings. 
Now I think Mr. Bishop maybe will elaborate a little bit more on 
how  those  invasive  species  are  impacting  a  very  vital  industry  in 
Washington  State,  obviously  in  the  shellfish  industry.  Thank  you 
for being here. 

STATEMENT OF BRETT BISHOP, CO-OWNER, LITTLE SKOOKUM 
SHELLFISH  GROWERS;  ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PACIFIC  COAST 
SHELLFISH GROWERS ASSOCIATION 
Mr.  BISHOP.  You  are  welcome.  Good  morning.  I  am  honored  and 
surprised  to  be  here.  I  am  a  clam  digger  and  oyster  picker.  My 
name  is  Brett  Bishop,  and  today  I  am  representing  commercial 
shellfish growers from Alaska to California to Hawaii. 

Washington  State  produces  85  percent  of  the  shellfish  grown  on 
the  West  Coast,  and  we  in  Washington  State  are  now  the  largest 
producer of farmed shellfish in the United States. 

My family’s farm is on Little Skookum Bay. We are a traditional 
family  farm,  with  tides.  Mom  and  dad  live  next  door.  Mom  is  91. 
Dad  is  93.  They  still  take  care  of  themselves,  but  I  do  the  driving 
now.  My  two  teenage  boys  are  the  sixth  generation  in  our  family 
to  live  on  the  homestead  and  grow  clams  and  oysters  in  Skookum 
Bay. We would like to keep that going. 

We  are  typical  of  other  shellfish  farmers,  and  we  are  all  facing 
problems  that  appear  to  be  related  to  a  warming  climate  and

greenhouse gases. We have a current crisis in several of the larger 
shellfish  hatcheries.  It  is  a  new  bacterium  called  Vibrio  tubiashii, 
and  it  interferes  with  the  reproduction  of  oysters  and  clams  when 
they are in the larval stage, less than 1 millimeter. 

In the hatcheries, it is devastating. The largest hatchery we have 
is  in  Whiskey  Creek,  Oregon,  in  Netarts  Bay,  and  this  year,  they 
shut their doors and laid off employees. What they have been doing 
is retooling their facility. They have added ultraviolet filtration and 
protein skimmers, and they have shown some early success. But in 
the  marine  environment,  particularly  in  the  coastal  bays  such  as 
Willapa  and  Grays  Harbor—well,  in  Willapa  Bay,  they  are  in  year 
three of little or no natural oyster setting. So they now have to rely 
on  hatcheries,  and  the  hatcheries  have  this  problem.  They  are  in 
dire straits. 

Even if we fix the problem in the hatcheries, it still leaves unre-
solved  the  ability  of  oysters  to  reproduce  in  the  wild.  We  need  to 
be clear about this. The current situation puts not just the shellfish 
grower, but the entire marine ecosystem in extreme jeopardy. I am 
scared. 

A  problem  of  even  greater  magnitude  is  this  acidification  of  sea-
water  that  we  have  heard  about.  I  heard  about  it  last  week,  and 
I  haven’t  forgotten  about  it  for  a  moment  since.  This  acidity  dis-
solves  calcium  carbonate,  which  is  the  thing  the  shells  are  made 
out of. And if diatoms, corals, or clams and oysters succumb to this, 
it not only wipes out the shellfish industry, but potentially the en-
tire marine food chain. 

I know that is a dark and gloomy picture we have been painting 
for  you  today.  So,  as  a  counterpoint  to  that,  let  me  tell  you  some-
thing  else.  Shellfish  growers  are  perhaps  the  only  category  of  hu-
mans that might actually benefit from climate change. Here is how 
it might work. 

Instead of having to mow my front lawn once a week, as sea lev-
els  rise  because  of  melting  ice  caps,  I  might  be  able  to  grow  clams 
and  oysters  in  the  front  lawn.  Of  course,  we  have  to  survive  as  a 
business to reap the benefit from that future date. I am not so sure 
we are going to. 

Shellfish  perform  vital  ecosystem  functions  as  they  filter-feed. 
Just  about  every  human  activity  that  takes  place  on  the  uplands 
contributes  nutrients  to  the  marine  environment,  and  when  the 
shellfish  is  harvested,  it  represents  one  of  the  very  few  human  ac-
tivities  that  actually  withdraw  nutrients  from  the  marine  environ-
ment.  So  all  the  oceans  need  filter-feeding  shellfish,  whether  it  is 
my family growing them or not. 

From  the  perspective  of  the  Bishop  family,  it  looks  like  this.  We 
have invested everything that we have and everything that we are 
on  our  farm.  We  have  a  mortgage  with  Farm  Credit  Services.  We 
employ  27  people  year  round,  gross  sales  of  about  $2.8  million  a 
year.  If  we  can’t  grow  our  shellfish,  the  bank  will  foreclose  on  the 
mortgage, we will lose our farm, our homes, and six generations of 
hopes  and  dreams  and  investment,  which  is  just  about  everything 
that we hold dear. 

We  do  not  intend  to  be  passive  witnesses  to  our  own  demise. 
Growers have thoughts. With electricity, we have boats and people 
out on the beach at every low tide. We are ready to supply physical

locations,  telemetry,  and  field  work  at  no  cost  to  researchers,  who 
are helping us figure out our common problems. If science can sup-
ply  the  intelligence,  we  will  help  with  the  means.  Please  use  us. 

Thank you for your attention. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Bishop follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF BRETT BISHOP, CO-OWNER, LITTLE SKOOKUM SHELLFISH 
GROWERS; ON BEHALF OF THE PACIFIC COAST SHELLFISH GROWERS ASSOCIATION 
My name is Brett Bishop and today I am representing commercial shellfish grow-
ers on the Pacific Coast from Alaska to California. For the record, 85 percent of all 
shellfish produced on the West Coast are grown in Washington, where we’ve farmed 
shellfish for 150 years. We’re actually the largest producer of farmed shellfish in the 
entire United States. 

My family’s farm is on Little Skookum Bay in Mason County. We are a traditional 
family  farm,  with  tides.  My  parents  live  next  door,  Mom  is  91  and  Dad  is  93.  My 
two  teenage  boys  are  the  sixth  generation  to  live  on  the  old  homestead  and  grow 
clams and oysters in Little Skookum Bay. 

We  are  typical  of  most  other  shellfish  growers,  and  we  are  all  facing  unprece-
dented problems that appear to be linked to warming oceans and low oxygen condi-
tions.  The  ‘dead  zone,’  identified  in  2002  off  the  coast  of  Oregon,  has  now  been  ob-
served by researchers all the way up into Canada. We’ve been able to correlate the 
dead  zone  and  upwelling  events  with  the  presence  of  a  marine  bacteria,  Vibrio 
tubiashii,  in  many  of  our  growing  areas  and  hatcheries.  Vibrio  tubiashii  thrives  in 
low oxygen (hypoxic) and no oxygen (anoxic) conditions. 

In  the  wild,  it  kills  oyster  larva  and  seed  up  to  at  least  1  mm.  which  has  inter-
rupted the natural cycle of propagation, resulting in little or no ‘‘natural set’’ in the 
bays and estuaries where we make our living. While many growers in Puget Sound, 
Oregon  and  California  depend  primarily  on  hatchery-produced  seed,  many  growers 
in  Willapa  Bay,  which  produces  almost  60  percent  of  Washington  State’s  oysters, 
continue  to  depend  on  natural  set  seed.  Growers  there  are  reporting  that  they  are 
now experiencing their third year with virtually no seed set. This forces them to rely 
on  hatchery  production  of  juvenile  shellfish  to  assure  adequate  crops,  but  Vibrio 
tubiashii  has  infected  most  of  our  West  Coast  hatcheries.  Our  largest  producer  of 
larvae,  Whiskey  Creek  Hatchery,  has  in  fact  had  to  close  their  doors  temporarily, 
and  lay  off  staff,  while  they  retrofit  their  operation  with  a  series  of  filtration  sys-
tems  in  an  attempt  to  keep  the  Vibrio  tubiashii  out  of  the  water  they  are  pumping 
into  their  facility  from  Netarts  Bay  in  Oregon.  Growers  have  been  donating  funds 
to  Whiskey  Creek,  to  aid  them  in  their  research  into  solutions  for  hatcheries.  If  a 
way  is  found  to  rid  the  hatcheries  of  Vibrio  tubiashii,  and  a  system  can  be  engi-
neered  that  allows  us  to  grow  seed  up  to  at  least  1  mm  in  size,  we  may  be  able 
to save our shellfish farmers. 

Left unresolved is the ability of oysters to reproduce in the wild. 
I  need  to  be  clear  about  this;  the  current  situation  puts  both  the  marine  eco-sys-
tem  and  shellfish  growers  in  extreme  jeopardy.  Diminished  natural  reproduction 
coupled  with  failing  hatcheries  puts  us  in  a  position  where  we  stand  to  lose  it  all. 
A  problem  of  even  greater  magnitude  is  the  acidification  of  seawater.  A  NOAA 
researcher,  Richard  Feely,  reports  finding  levels  of  acidity  along  the  Pacific  Coast 
of North America that were not predicted until 50 to 100 years from now. This acid-
ity dissolves calcium carbonate, the stuff that shells are made of. If diatoms, corals 
and  shellfish  succumb  to  this,  it  might  collapse  not  only  the  shellfish  industry,  but 
the entire marine food chain. Life as we have known it might soon change. 

It  is  a  dark  and  gloomy  picture  that  I  just  painted.  In  counterpoint  to  that,  let 
me  tell  you  something  else;  shellfish  growers  might  be  the  only  category  of  people 
who  stand  to  benefit  from  the  effects  of  climate  change.  As  polar  ice  melts  and  sea 
levels rise, our front yards and lawns may become suitable places for growing clams 
and oysters. 

Of  course,  our  businesses  would  have  to  survive  financially  to  reap  any  benefits 
from  that  future  day.  This  is  why  we  need  to  solve  the  problem  in  the  hatcheries 
now, and address the acidification of the oceans. 

Our  shellfish  crops  perform  vital  eco-system  functions  as  they  filter-feed.  Just 
about every human activity that occurs on the uplands contributes nutrients to the 
marine environment. When a clam or oyster is harvested, it becomes one of the very 
few human activities that result in a withdrawal of nutrients from the water. Clean 
and healthy oceans need filter feeding shellfish, whether it’s my family that’s grow-
ing them or not.

From the perspective of the Bishop family it looks like this: we have invested ev-
erything  we  have  and  everything  that  we  are  in  our  farm.  We  have  been  growing 
as  we  could  afford  to  for  the  last  one  hundred  and  twenty  four  years.  We  have  a 
mortgage  with  Farm  Credit  Services.  We  employ  27  people  year-round  with  gross 
sales of $2.8 million. 

If  we  can’t  grow  our  shellfish,  the  bank  will  foreclose  on  the  mortgage,  we  will 
lose  the  farm,  our  homes,  and  six  generations  of  our  hopes  and  dreams  and  invest-
ments. That is most of everything that we hold dear. 

This is what I am reporting to you folks today. 
I thank you for your attention.

State.  I  also  co-chair  the  Salmon  Recovery  Council  for  the  Puget 
Sound,  and  I  am  a  program  officer  for  the  Ocean  Foundation.  And 
last,  I  serve  on  the  Ecosystem  Coordination  Board  for  the  Puget 
Sound Partnership. 

I  want  to  touch  on  some  of  the  ecosystem  impacts,  simply  to 
bring it down to a local level in my testimony today, so I will sum-
marize my written comments that you have already received. 

The  effects  of  climate  change  are  dramatic  for  a  Pacific  Rim 
state, such as Washington State, and particularly dramatic for the 
coastal communities along our 2,300 miles of coastline. 

I  want  to  quote  from  the  University  of  Washington  Climate  Im-
pacts Group paper, ‘‘Uncertain Future: Climate Change and the Ef-
fects  on  Puget  Sound.’’  They  wrote,  ‘‘Changes  caused  by  global 
warming  are  likely  to  reverberate  across  the  Puget  Sound  eco-
system  in  complex  and  unpredictable  ways,  disrupting  crucial 
interactions  between  plant,  animal,  and  human  communities.’’  We 
are talking about an ecosystem problem here. 

Some  of  the  specific  impacts  that  we  will  see  in  the  future  and 
that  we  are  already  seeing,  we  have  heard  about  some  regarding 
acidification  and  other  issues.  We  are  also  seeing  significant  im-
pacts  to  the  snow-fed  water  supplies  for  Washington  State,  which 
will  have  a  dramatic  impact  on  our  rivers,  streams,  lakes,  and 
drinking water for millions of Washington citizens. 

We  have  heard  about  sea  level  rise.  We  will  continue  to  see  sea 
level  rise  impacts.  And  as  a  coastal-elected  official,  those  impacts 
are  very  significant.  When  the  sea  level  rises,  we  talk  about  mil-
lions of dollars in infrastructure upgrades, millions of dollars in im-
pacts  to  coastal  development,  to  say  nothing  of  the  changing  plan-
ning and allotting for our communities. 

We  will  see  increased  and  are  seeing  increases  in  air  tempera-
ture  and  water  temperature.  We  have  heard  about  the  impacts  on

salmon.  This  will  also  dramatically  impact  our  other  commercial 
and recreational fisheries. 

We  are  also  already  seeing  stronger  and  more  frequent  winter 
storms  in  the  Northwest.  I  was  elected  to  the  San  Juan  County 
Board  of  County  Commissioners  in  2004.  When  I  was  elected,  we 
had  not  declared  a  state  of  emergency  in  San  Juan  County  in  sev-
eral  decades.  In  2006  and  2007,  we  had  three  major  storms  and 
had  to  declare  emergency  situations  in  San  Juan  County  in  a  2- 
year  period.  We  had  no  power.  We  had  snow  and  no  water  for  our 
elderly out in the rural areas for several days. 

These  sorts  of  trends,  and  what  we  are  reading  in  the  research 

and data that have been compiled, will continue. 

We  have  also  seen  increased  and  will  continue  to  see  increased 
flooding in Washington State in our watersheds. Recent flooding in 
southwest  Washington,  and  particularly  the  Skagit,  has  cost 
human  lives.  It  cost  thousands  in  dead  cattle  and  other  livestock, 
millions of dollars in damage, and significant long-term community 
impacts. 

There  are  also,  as  we  have  heard,  significant  economic  impacts 
associated  with  these  changes,  with  the  shellfish  industry,  with 
commercial and recreational fishing, with coastal development and 
infrastructure.  And  also  something  that  we  don’t  always  think 
about  with  regard  to  climate  change  is  the  direct  relationship  be-
tween a healthy and beautiful natural environment in Washington 
State and our tourism economy. 

Tourism  in  2006  raised  $13.9  billion—that  is  billion  with  a  B— 
dollars for our state economy and employed 146,000 people. In San 
Juan County, in my district, $121 million and employed 1,700 peo-
ple.  This  is  a  very  important  piece  of  our  economy  that  will  also 
be dramatically impacted. 

And I raise that just to point out kind of the—I don’t necessarily 
want to go crazy here—but the trickle-down effect of this situation 
throughout our economy and throughout our environment. 

Here  in  Washington  State,  under  the  leadership  of  Governor 
Gregoire,  we  have  made  some  local  and  state-based  changes  that 
are  very  significant  and  need  to  be  pointed  out  today.  One  is  with 
regard  to  emissions  reduction.  By  2020,  having  cars  down  to  1990 
standards, green car initiative standards by 2009, energy efficiency 
standards  for  appliances,  and  green  building  standards  are  all 
things that have been advocated by our Governor. 

The  larger  issue,  however,  as  Dr.  Miles  stated,  is  that  we  have 
an  ecosystem  problem.  For  an  ecosystem  problem,  we  must  have 
ecosystem solutions. 

I want to spent the last few minutes of my comments today talk-
ing  about  ecosystem-based  management  and  why  it  is  so  very  im-
portant  to  start  looking  in  that  direction  when  we  face  climate 
change issues. 

There  are  several  examples  of  this  here  in  Washington  State. 
One  is  the  recently  established—and  Congressman  Inslee  is  very 
involved  in  this—the  Puget  Sound  Partnership.  The  Puget  Sound 
Partnership  is  taking  a  look  at  ecosystems  from  the  snowcaps  to 
the  whitecaps.  And  when  we  have  an  ecosystem  problem,  such  as 
climate  change,  we  must  begin  to  manage  our  resources  and  our 
human activities in an ecosystem perspective.

The  Puget  Sound  Partnership  has  six  ecosystem  goals—human 
health, human quality of life, species biodiversity and the food web, 
habitat and land use, water quality, and water quantity. These are 
critical  issues.  We  cannot  continue  to  manage  our  resources  on  a 
habitat  by  habitat,  species  by  species,  or  in  my  case,  as  a  locally 
elected  official,  individual  lot  by  individual  lot  perspective.  We 
must take an ecosystem focus. 

In  San  Juan  County,  we  launched  the  San  Juan  Initiative.  We 
brought  together  the  heads  of  all  of  our  state  resource  agencies— 
thank  you,  Dr.  Koenings,  for  participating—the  heads  of  all  of  our 
Federal  agencies  for  the  region,  and  tribal  and  local  leaders  to 
begin addressing how we can actually do this on a local level. 

The  recommendations  of  the  San  Juan  Initiative  will  be  com-
pleted  this  year.  Those  recommendations  will  go  to  our  state  and 
Federal  and  tribal  partners  with  regard  to  specifically  how  we  can 
begin  to  look  at  climate  change  and  other  ecosystem  problems  fac-
ing us. 

On a Federal level, something else that is very important to pay 
attention  to  when  it  comes  to  these  issues  is  the  Federal  Joint 
Ocean  Commission  Initiative.  That  body  is  providing  coordination 
for state efforts, such as the Puget Sound Partnership, local efforts 
such  as  the  San  Juan  Initiative.  On  a  national  perspective,  we 
must  have  a  coordinated  approach  to  these  issues  so  that  we  can 
generate these wonderful successes on a local level that can be rep-
licated on a national or statewide perspective. 

Specific  recommendations,  in  my  conclusion  here,  we  are  aware 
that  the  Federal  Government  has  some  recommendations  on  what 
needs  to  be  happening.  First  of  all,  continued  support  for  NOAA, 
academic  institutions  such  as  the  University  of  Washington,  non-
governmental  organizations,  which  provide  research  and  modeling, 
is critical to addressing these issues—critical for myself as a locally 
elected  official,  critical  for  State  managers  and  Federal  managers. 
Without that data, we cannot plan appropriately. 

We  also  must  formally  recognize  and  support  local  efforts,  such 
as  the  San  Juan  Initiative,  State-based  efforts  such  as  the  Puget 
Sound  Partnership,  and  regional  and  national  efforts  of  coordina-
tion such as the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative. 

And  last,  we  need  your  colleagues  to  step  up  the  way  you  have 
and be true champions with regard to these issues. What we sorely 
need is a renewal of the kind of leadership commitment, and inno-
vation  at  the  Federal  level  that  in  the  past  defined  the  United 
States  as  a  leading  force  in  the  protection  of  our  environment  and 
our planet. I hope that as we move forward, we can work together 
to regain that position. 

And  the  last  comment  I  will  make  is,  Congressman  Inslee,  you 
mentioned  the  next  generation.  I  have  a  5-week-old  daughter.  I 
have  thoroughly  enjoyed  my  times  on  the  Puget  Sound  and  my 
memories  playing  with  my  father  and  my  grandfather  on  the 
beaches  and  on  Orcas  Island.  And  it  is  not  a  choice,  but  an  abso-
lute  mandate,  that  we  must  take  these  actions  now  for  my  daugh-
ter and my daughter’s generation. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. KEVIN RANKER, MEMBER, 

SAN JUAN COUNTY COUNCIL, STATE OF WASHINGTON 

Introduction 

Thank  you,  Chairman  Inouye  and  Senators,  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today. 
Welcome to Washington State. I am so glad to see that Chairman Inouye continues 
his legacy of supporting Washington State as he did in the Magnusson/Jackson era 
now  during  the  Murray/Cantwell  era.  Senator,  we  have  something  in  common  we 
both live on islands and therefore our constituents could be the most affected by sea 
level rise and climate change. 

For  the  record,  I’m  Kevin  Ranker.  I’m  a  San  Juan  County  Council  Member  (and 
Chair of the Puget Sound Salmon Recovery Council, the Washington Coastal Coun-
ties Caucus, Pacific Region Program Officer of the Ocean Foundation and a member 
of the Ecosystem Coordination Board of the Puget Sound Partnership, which is tak-
ing  an  ecosystem-based  approach  to  restoring  and  protecting  our  jewel,  Puget 
Sound, by the year 2020). 

The  2007  report  from  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC) 

says it best: 

‘‘Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observa-
tions in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow 
and ice, and rising global average sea level.’’ 

Based on 20 years of research and thousands of published, peer-reviewed reports, 
the  IPCC  concluded  that  it  is  more  than  90  percent  likely  that  the  accelerated 
warming of the past 50 to 60 years is due to human contributions. 

Scientists also tell us that Washington State is particularly vulnerable to the im-

pacts of climate change. 

As  a  Pacific  Rim  state,  sea  level  rise  associated  with  temperature  rise  is  a  con-

cern—especially for all of the communities along our 2,300 miles of shoreline. 

• A study released in January concludes that sea levels in Puget Sound are likely 
to  rise  a  half  a  foot  by  mid-century.  The  study  (Sea  Level  Rise  in  the  Coastal 
Waters of Washington State, 2008), conducted by the University of Washington’s 
Climate Impacts Group and the state Department of Ecology, factored in global 
warming as well as local weather patterns and geology. 
• Under  its  worst-case  scenario,  regarded  as  unlikely,  but  still  a  possibility,  sea 

levels in Puget Sound could rise more than 4 feet by 2100. 

Also  making  Washington  especially  vulnerable  to  climate  change  are  our  snow- 
fed  water  supplies.  Snowmelt  feeds  rivers  and  streams,  providing  essential  support 
to  all  kinds  of  ecosystems,  salmon  and  other  wildlife  as  well  as  critical  aquifer  re-
charge for drinking water for millions of Washington citizens. 

The impact of these changes will also be widespread and devastating to numerous 
sectors of our economy. While obvious economic impacts due to climate change have 
been raised, such as the loss of coastal development, rebuilding of infrastructure or 
impacts  to  commercial  fisheries,  impacts  associated  with  the  relationship  between 
a  healthy  environment  and  a  healthy  economy  are  less  frequently  discussed.  Tour-
ism  for  example,  depends  a  great  deal  on  a  healthy  Puget  Sound  and  surrounding 
natural  environment.  In  2006  Washington  State  tourism  revenue  was  $13.9  billion 
and  created  146,500  jobs.  In  San  Juan  County  during  the  same  year  tourism  rev-
enue  topped  $121.1  million  and  created  1,780  jobs.  The  economic  impact  of  losing 
key  ecosystem  services  will  be  severe  and  widespread  throughout  our  statewide 
economy. 
Impacts of Climate Change on Puget Sound 

Another study (Uncertain Future: Climate Change and Its Effects on Puget Sound, 
2005) by the University of Washington’s Climate Impacts Group concludes that ‘‘pro-
found changes have occurred in the Puget Sound over the past century and the next 
several decades will see even more change.’’ 

‘‘Changes caused by a warming climate are likely to reverberate across the Puget 
Sound ecosystem in complex and unpredictable ways, disrupting crucial interactions 
between Puget Sound plants and animals—and their environment.’’ 

Projected changes include: 
• Continued  increases  in  air  and  water  temperature.  Air  and  water  temperatures 

have risen more here than in other parts of the world. 
» Increased  air  temperatures  have  reduced  spring  snowpack,  produced  earlier 
spring  snowmelt,  increased  winter  flow  and  decreased  summer  flow—which 
can lead to altered habitat for fish and other species.

• And  even  the  lowest  estimated  warming  could  change  the  Northwest’s 

climate significantly more than the warming of the 20th century. 

» Warmer  water  temperature  has  the  potential  to  put  many  species  at  risk,  in-

cluding plankton, the foundation of Puget Sound’s food web. 

• Continued  alteration  of  river  and  stream  flows.  With  decreased  snowpack  and 
earlier snowmelt, Western Washington’s low summer stream flows are likely to 
be further reduced, while winter stream flows rise, altering the timing of fresh-
water inputs to marine waters. 

• Increased  flooding  in  Puget  Sound  watersheds.  Recent  flooding  has  cost  human 
lives, hundreds of cattle and other farm animals, and millions of dollars in prop-
erty  damage,  to  say  nothing  of  the  years  of  recovery  for  the  local  communities 
that were impacted. Projections show that this trend will continue. 

• Accelerated rates of sea level rise are likely to increase both the pace and extent 
of  erosion  and  nearshore  habitat  loss  already  affecting  Puget  Sound  shorelines. 
The slightest changes in average sea level can dramatically impact the existing 
fragile  nearshore  ecosystems  of  the  Puget  Sound.  Further,  as  the  Puget  Sound 
rises,  the  impact  on  coastal  development  increases.  This  trend  leads  to  in-
creased  coastal  armoring  which  devastates  nearshore  habitats.  The  nearshore 
ecosystems  of  the  Puget  Sound  provide  critical  habitat  for  numerous  species 
currently listed under the Endangered Species Act. 

• Salt  marshes  at  risk.  Projected  changes  in  water  temperature,  water  salinity 
and  soil  salinity  could  change  the  mix  of  plant  species  in  salt  marshes  and  the 
viability  of  invertebrates  that  play  a  key  role  in  the  health  of  salt  marsh  sys-
tems. 

• Increased  likelihood  of  algal  blooms  and  low  oxygen  concentrations  in  bottom 
waters. Increased algal productivity would lead to a further depletion of oxygen 
at depth. 
» Puget  Sound  is  one  of  the  largest  shellfish-producing  regions  in  the  United 
States;  and  Puget  Sound  shellfish  are  vulnerable  to  contamination  by  the 
toxics produced by harmful algal blooms. 

Effects of Climate Change on Salmon 

Salmon are fundamental to Pacific Northwest ecology, culture and economy. 
Unfortunately,  in  most  river  basins,  wild  populations  are  severely  depleted.  Sev-
eral  stocks  have  been  listed  or  are  being  considered  for  listing  under  the  Endan-
gered Species Act. 

Salmon depend on both freshwater and marine habitats. They need: 
• Clean, cold water; well-connected rivers; and reliable stream flows for spawning, 

rearing and migration; 

• healthy estuaries where juveniles can adjust to ocean conditions, and adults can 

rest before spawning upstream; and 

• productive  ocean  conditions,  with  abundant  food  sources  and  optimal  tempera-

ture regimes. 

And climate change is taking its toll on salmon, too. 
• More rain and less snow have led to a major change in hydrograph: higher high 
flows, lower low flows. This both increases the vulnerability of their eggs to flood 
wipe out and decreases the rearing capacity of rivers to support juvenile salmon. 
• Because  less  snowpack  feeds  the  rivers,  water  temperatures  are  warmer  in  the 

summer, which lowers the survival of rearing juvenile salmon. 

• Warmer  summer  temperatures  increase  the  mortality  of  holding  adult  salmon 
(particularly spring and summer Chinook and summer steelhead—as they enter 
rivers many months before spawning). 

• Warmer summer temperatures increase the prevalence of certain parasites, which 
increases in-river mortality of return adults. (This has been a problem with Fra-
ser  River  sockeye  in  recent  years  and  has  been  noted  in  Puget  Sound  rivers, 
like the Stillaguamish.) 

• Modeling  suggests  that  global  climate  change  will  modify  circulation  patterns 
resulting  in  microclimate  changes.  For  example,  more  rainfall  is  likely  to  occur 
in  lower  valleys  making  less  precipitation  available  for  upper  watersheds.  This 
will  exacerbate  the  effects  on  lower  summer  flows  and  higher  temperatures,  fur-
ther reducing the capacity of rivers for species such as steelhead and spring Chi-
nook, which depend on upper watershed rearing.

• Sea  level  rise  will  completely  modify  lower  main  stem,  estuarine  and  nearshore 
rearing  habitats,  which  have  been  identified  as  key  habitats  for  some  species/ 
stocks  (e.g.,  Skagit  and  Snohomish  Chinook  salmon).  This  means  that  habitat 
restoration and protection actions will likely be less effective than modeled. 

• Climate  change  is  associated  with  broad  changes  in  ocean  circulation  patterns. 
The  tendency  is  likely  more  toward  the  El  Nin˜ o-like  years,  meaning  less 
upwelling, less productivity and poorer salmon survival in the ocean. 

• As  noted  earlier,  higher  average  ocean  temperatures  will  alter  the  marine  food 

web and reduce survivability of salmon. 

What Washington Is Doing to Adapt to Climate Change 

Thanks in large part to the leadership of Gov. Chris Gregoire and the state legis-

lature, Washington is taking bold steps to address climate change. 

In  Washington,  nearly  50  percent  of  our  greenhouse  gas  emissions  come  from 

cars, trucks, planes and ships. With this in mind: 

• Emission  reduction.  In  2007,  emission-reduction  goals  were  established.  In 

2008, the goals were replaced by statewide emission limits: 
» To return to 1990 emission levels by 2020. 
» To reduce emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. 

• Emissions  disclosure.  To  assist  consumers  in  making  informed  decisions  about 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  when  buying  a  vehicle,  starting  in  2010,  disclosure 
labels will be placed on new passenger vehicles. 

• Clean cars. Beginning with model year 2009, new cars sold in Washington must 
meet  the  clean  car  standards  adopted  by  California  and  16  other  states,  which 
will help significantly reduce air quality pollutants. 

Energy  efficiency  avoids  the  need  to  increase  power  generation,  which  can  avoid 

increases in greenhouse gas emissions. Along those lines: 

• Energy  efficiency  standards.  Washington  has  adopted  strong  energy  efficiency 

standards for new appliance products. 

• Green  building  standards.  Washington  became  the  first  state  in  the  Nation  to 

require that state buildings be built to LEED silver certification. 

Ecosystem-Based Management in Washington 

Puget  Sound  Partnership:  Another  testament  to  the  Governor’s  leadership  and 
concern  for  the  environment  came  last  year,  when  she  and  the  legislature  created 
the Puget Sound Partnership to restore and protect Puget Sound. 

Puget Sound’s beauty belies its problems: 
• Puget  Sound  orcas  are  the  most  contaminated  marine  mammals  in  the  world. 
• Shellfish beds are closed because their harvests are unsafe to eat. 
• Beaches are closed because they are unsafe for swimming. 
• The list of Puget Sound species that are threatened or endangered is long and, 

without action, likely to grow. 

And a projected population growth of some 1.5 million people by 2020, which will 

put more stress on the Sound, only increases the urgency to act now. 

The  Puget  Sound  Partnership,  which  I  have  the  pleasure  to  be  involved  with,  is 

different from previous cleanup efforts in many respects. 

• Its work is based on science. 
• It will hold entities charged with the tasks accountable for results. 
• And,  it  is  charged  with  looking  at  the  entire  ecosystem—from  the  snowcaps  to 

the whitecaps. 

In  developing  its  Action  Agenda  for  a  restored  Sound  by  2020,  the  Partnership 

is considering 6 ecosystem goals: 

• human health; 
• human quality of life; 
• species, biodiversity and food web; 
• habitat and land use; 
• water quality; and 
• water quantity.

This ecosystem-based approach will be essential to turning around the fate of the 

Sound—a task only made more difficult by climate change. 

San  Juan  Initiative:  In  San  Juan  County,  we  have  a  local  effort  that  will  rec-
ommend  changes  to  how  local  government  and  state  and  Federal  agencies  protect 
the  remaining  high  quality  habitat  of  the  Islands  and  by  extension,  all  of  Puget 
Sound.  The  San  Juan  Initiative’s  assessment  of  protection  effectiveness  will  mostly 
demonstrate that parcel-by-parcel protection has not worked to protect what we care 
about.  The  Assessment  points  out  that  the  way  forward  is  through  ecosystem  or 
reach level management that engages the community in finding ways to manage col-
lective resources together, insuring that the values of the community are expressed 
in protection efforts. 

The San Juan Initiative will be completed this year and will point out where our 
combined  local,  state  and  Federal  efforts  are  working  to  protect  the  environment, 
address  climate  change  impacts  and  where  they  need  to  be  strengthened  to  fill  the 
gaps.  The  process  will  engage  citizens  and  governments  so  that  the  recommenda-
tions are ground-truthed and commitments are secured for actions necessary for im-
mediate implementation. 

The San Juan Initiative’s model for improving protection is the best way to begin 
preparing  for  climate  change  at  the  local  level.  The  effects  of  climate  change  will 
require  new  ideas  and  local  solutions  that  change  our  management  approach  to 
focus less on the parcel and more on the scale of ecosystems. 
Federal  Support  Needed  for  Better  Understanding,  Response  to  Climate 

Change’s Effects on Washington’s Marine, Coastal Ecosystems 

In  the  interest  of  time,  I  will  limit  my  remarks  about  necessary  Federal  support 
to salmon, as they are an excellent indicator of ecosystem health and our Northwest 
culture. 

Perhaps Jim Martin, former Chief of Oregon Fisheries and Salmon Adviser to Or-
egon Gov. John Kitzhaber, says it best in the ‘‘Light in the River’’ report on the ef-
fects of climate change on Columbia and Snake River salmon: 

‘‘Whether  salmon  can  recover  in  the  Columbia  and  Snake  Basin  depends  pri-
marily  on  Federal  policy.  Will  it  keep  backing  into  the  future  with  eyes  on  the 
past?  Or  will  it  turn  forward,  scout  the  changes  coming  fast  and  act  strategi-
cally?’’ 

The report recommends a restoration strategy with 4 primary features: 
• Immediate  actions  to  reduce  the  impacts  or  buffer  salmon  against  them,  with 

a priority focus on: 
» reconnecting salmon to headwater habitats; 
» protecting headwater flows and temperatures; and 
» reducing  mainstem  Columbia  and  Snake  River  mortalities  to  adult  and  espe-

cially juvenile salmon. 

histories and warming effects on each species. 

• Population-specific analyses and actions as precise as possible to the status, life 
• Assured  feedback  so  that  research  and  evaluation  of  effects  on  species  of  both 
chose  actions  and  warming  impacts  loop  back  quickly  and  certainly  to  modify 
and add actions, on an annual or biennial basis. 
• Assured  commitment  to  the  precautionary  principle  under  the  Endangered  Spe-
cies  Act—which,  requires  human  actions,  not  salmon,  to  bear  more  of  the  risks 
from global warming uncertainties and unknowns. 

Conclusion 

It  is  critical  that  the  Federal  Government  be  a  leader  in  the  efforts  to  address 
the  effects  of  climate  change  on  the  marine  and  coastal  ecosystems  of  Washington 
State  and  elsewhere  in  the  Nation.  Congress  must  provide  increased  support  to 
NOAA,  academic  institutions  and  non-governmental  organizations  who  are  con-
ducting  important  research  and  modeling  that  will  be  critical  to  coastal  states  and 
local  communities  as  we  develop  strategies  to  address  these  issues.  Congress  must 
also provide more support for the state, regional and local programs already under-
way  in  Washington  and  elsewhere  in  our  Nation.  These  ‘‘bottom-up’’  ecosystem- 
based efforts are developing local solutions and management strategies while engag-
ing  citizens  at  a  level  they  understand.  They  will  be  incredibly  valuable  models  for 
replication  as  the  effects  of  climate  change  become  more  apparent  over  the  coming 
years. 

Lastly, I want to emphasize that financial support is not enough. What we sorely 
need is a renewal of the kind of leadership, commitment and innovation at the Fed-

eral  level  that—in  the  past—defined  the  United  States  as  the  leading  force  in  pro-
tecting  the  environment  and  the  planet.  I  hope  that  as  we  move  forward  we  can 
all work together to regain that position. 

Thank you very much for the opportunity to testify today. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. Ranker. Thank you for being 
here,  and  congratulations  on  that  newborn  daughter.  And  I  am 
sure,  along  with  Mr.  Bishop,  you  are  working  hard  to  preserve 
Puget Sound and our oceans for the next generation. 

Well,  thank  you  all  for  your  testimony.  It  has  been  very  helpful. 
This  is  obviously  part  of  the  official  record  for  the  Senate  Com-
merce  Committee,  and  certainly  to  have  a  perspective  from  the 
Puget  Sound,  the  Northwest,  and  the  West  Coast  is,  I  think,  par-
ticularly important for the Nation. 

So  I  want  to  start,  Dr.  Klinger,  with  you  on  this  point.  Are  we 
seeing—we  certainly  are  seeing  more  of  an  impact  in  the  West,  on 
the  West  Coast  of  climate  change  in  the  sense  of  higher  tempera-
tures  than  in  other  places.  So  are  we  seeing  the  same  impacts  on 
the  acidification?  Are  we  at  a  higher  rate  of  acidification  on  the 
West Coast? And if so, what are we seeing in Puget Sound specifi-
cally? 

Dr.  KLINGER.  We  know  very  little  about  the  biological  effects  of 
acidification  on  the  West  Coast.  But  work  by  Dr.  Feely  and  Dr. 
Sabine  and  others  have  demonstrated  that  there  will  be  early  and 
strong  effects  of  acidification  in  coastal  ecosystems  in  the  North-
west and in the high-latitude systems. 

So  that  this  area—the  chemistry  suggests  that  this  area  is  par-
ticularly vulnerable. We do not yet have the biological or ecological 
data to link the chemistry to the biology. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Explain  that.  Explain  why  the  chemistry 
puts  us  in  the  Northwest  at  greater  risk  on  this  issue  of  CO2 in 
the oceans. 

Dr.  KLINGER.  In  nearshore  areas,  there  was  a  recent  paper  by 
Scott  Doney  and  his  colleagues  that  suggest  that  not  only  due  to 
the  absorption  of  CO2,  but  also  to  other  greenhouse  gas  emissions, 
urban  areas  such  as  the  Puget  Sound  urban  estuary  is  more  vul-
nerable than open ocean areas to acidification. But there are other 
reasons,  and  those  have  to  do  with  the  age  of  the  water  and  the 
circulation of it that make this region particularly vulnerable. 

Dr. Sabine is actually more of an expert on circulation than I am. 
Senator CANTWELL. Dr. Sabine, do you want to comment on that? 
Are  we  in  the  West  at  greater  risk,  or  are  we  seeing  a  more  rapid 
acidification than in other waters across the Nation? 

Dr.  SABINE.  Certainly.  As  I  mentioned  previously,  the  deep 
waters  of  the  open  oceans  naturally  have  much  higher  CO2 levels 
than  surface  waters.  And  as  the  waters  circulate  from  the  North 
Atlantic,  where  they  sink  from  the  surface,  down  around  through 
the  Antarctic  and  back  up  into  the  North  Pacific,  we  are  basically 
the  end  of  that  conveyor  belt  that  is  moving  water  from  the  North 
Atlantic into the North Pacific. 

During  that  whole  transit,  which  takes  about  1,500  years,  the 
oceans  are  accumulating  CO2 from  all  the  dead  organisms  falling 
into the ocean. What that means along our coast here, the corrosive 
waters are the shallowest that they are anywhere else in the world. 
So  when  you  then  add  on  top  of  that  the  anthropogenic  CO2 that

38 

is  coming  in  from  the  surface  that  combines  with  those  naturally 
acidic  waters,  that  makes  our  waters  much  more  prone  to  the  im-
pacts. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  So  you  are  saying  that  shallow  water  and 
runoff are combining? Is that what you are saying because we live 
in an urban area and have more? Is that what you are—— 

Dr.  SABINE.  No,  ma’am.  In  the  open  ocean,  the  waters  from  the 
deep  Pacific  that  are  coming  up  have—are  naturally  very  acidic. 
That  is  just  the  natural  inversion  of  CO2 across  the  ocean,  the 
interface of those two waters make it more corrosive toward the or-
ganisms. 

And  then  what  we  are  seeing  from  our  most  recent  research  is 
that water is now being drawn up onto the continental shelves, and 
that  is  what  we  are  concerned  about.  We  didn’t  expect  for  these 
levels  of  corrosive  waters  to  get  shallower  for  another  50  years. 
But,  in  fact,  it  is  kind  of  a  double  whammy  where  adding  CO2 to 
the  oceans  is  bringing  the  saturation  horizon  shallower.  Now  they 
have  moved  into  the  zone  of  waters  that  are  being  upwelled  onto 
the  shelf,  so  that  they  are  physically  being  dragged  up  to  the 
shallower depths more so than we expected in the past. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  Mr.  Bishop  brought  up  not  wanting  to 
sound so gloomy about this. But I do think it is important to under-
stand  unabated  where  we  are  going  as  it  relates  to  the  food  chain 
and  the  Puget  Sound,  particularly  as  it  relates  to  the  impact  on 
salmon  and  to  our  orca  population.  And  I  don’t  know  if  you  could 
comment  on  where  you  think  this  current  trajectory  puts  us  on  as 
it relates to the food chain and the availability. 

Dr. SABINE. The oceans are absorbing about 2 billion metric tons 
of  carbon  each  year.  That  is  a  natural  process.  Whenever  you  in-
crease CO2 above any liquid, it will absorb that CO2. That is what 
the oceans are naturally doing. But that is changing the chemistry. 
And  as  long  as  CO2 continues  to  increase  in  the  atmosphere,  the 
oceans will continue to absorb that. 

We are seeing these corrosive waters in the open ocean naturally 
getting  shallower  by  about  1  to  2  meters  each  year.  Every  year,  it 
is getting shallower and shallower and shallower until it eventually 
breaks  the  surface.  That  is  going  to  continue  basically  no  matter 
what.  So  what  we  are  seeing  is  only  going  to  get  worse  over  time. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  Dr.  Klinger,  would  you  like  to  comment  on 
food  chain  and  the  impact  on  the  food  chain?  Was  it  Dr.  Koenings 
saying  how  it  relates  to  salmon  and  the  orca  population?  We  are 
already obviously seeing impacts on both these species and moving 
a  lot  in  these  areas  to  try  to  recover  and  save  these  species.  So 
what  is  the  impact  of  this  acidification,  what  is  the  trajectory  we 
are on right now? 

Dr.  KLINGER.  That  is  a  very  difficult  question.  Dr.  Koenings 
spoke  to  the  uncertainty  on  this  issue,  and  I—there  is  no  science 
that  can  inform  that—an  answer  to  that  question  at  this  time. 
There  are  concerns.  There  are  early  responses—sadly,  responses, 
for example, in the very small stages of fish and invertebrates that 
could easily be impacted. 

We would see impacts in those young recruits before we actually 
see impacts on adults. And what that would perhaps promise is re-
duced  recruitment  or  a  recruitment  failure  so  that  absence  of  new

on that? 

recruits  to  populations,  it  could  apply  to  fish  populations  and  to 
shellfish populations. 

But as I said, we don’t know at this point what the impacts will 
be.  The  food  web  effects  could  be  very  large.  In  my  own  opinion, 
they are very unpredictable at this point. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Dr.  Koenings,  do  you  just  want  to  comment 

Dr.  KOENINGS.  As  a  resource  manager  that  takes  science  and 
builds  the  management  decisions  that  affect  people’s  lives,  it  is  a 
very  difficult  period  for  us  to  go  through  right  now  in  terms  of 
management of natural resources. I think we are seeing some very 
definite changes in our salmon populations in particular. 

The  synchronicity  of  the  fresh  water  phase,  the  marine  phase  is 
no longer as tight as it used to be, i.e., the young fish coming down 
from  the  fresh  water  hitting  the  ocean.  That  survival  phase  is  not 
as great as it used to be. We are seeing a lot of changes in the fish-
ing patterns of our fleets. We base our models that we use for man-
agement these days on historic fishing patterns. 

Those  historic  fishing  patterns  are  basically  not  catching  the 
same  fish  that  they  caught  before  because  thermal  routines  are 
changing,  and  we  haven’t  been  able  to  keep  up  with  those  kinds 
of changes in our mathematical models that we rely on so heavily. 
So there are a lot of changes that are going on that we are already 
seeing that management has to respond to. 

And  one  way  of  responding  to  them  is  simply  saying  in  light  of 
all this uncertainty, we just need to cool it. We need to cut the har-
vest,  for  example,  in  certain  species  down  to  a  level  that  we  think 
is  sustainable.  Harvest  rates  on  salmon  that  maybe  in  the  past 
years  were  sustainable  at  60  or  70  percent  harvest  level,  probably 
are now in the 20 or 30 percent harvest level today simply because 
of  productivity  of  those  stocks  aren’t  as  good  as  it  used  to  be,  and 
I  think  that  trend  is  going  to  continue  for  a  number  of  years.  So 
until we can solve—— 

Senator  CANTWELL.  When  you  say  ‘‘productivity,’’  you  are  refer-

ring to—? 

Dr.  KOENINGS.  The  productivity,  the  number  of,  let  us  say,  the 
number of salmon produced per generation, i.e., you have 1,000 fish 
in this generation, you expect 3,000 or more of the next generation. 
Right  now,  we  are  getting  maybe  harvest  rates  a  little  bit  higher. 
One thousand is producing 1,000. So we are seeing the harvest has 
to respond to that. 

So  the  productivity  isn’t  as  high  as  it  used  to  be.  And  we  have 
to  respond  as  resource  managers.  So  there  are  definitely  changes 
going  on,  again,  that  I  referred  to  as  sort  of  bizarre  in  terms  of 
their perspective. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Mr.  Ranker,  do  you  want  to  comment  on 

Mr.  RANKER.  Just  specifically,  with  regard  to  the  food  web  ef-
fects,  as  we  see  alterations  in—the  research  is  suggesting,  we  see 
alterations  in  estuaries  and  nearshore  environments,  and  we  need 
not only focus on the individual salmon and the out-migrating juve-
nile salmon which use those areas for foraging, but also the foraged 
fish,  the  herring.  These  small  fish  represent  a  significant  majority 

this?

of  the  salmon’s  diet,  and  then  the  salmon  represent  a  significant 
majority of the southern resident orca whale population’s diet. 

So, again, when we are looking at individual alterations and spe-
cific habitats, we need to recognize that there is impact on the food 
source going all the way up to the orca whale. 

Senator CANTWELL. Well, I think this is exactly what we are see-
ing  already.  Yes,  we  are  seeing  a  major  impact  on  the  food  source 
for both of those species. 

So, Dr. Miles, I am saving all my questions for you as to the solu-
tions. But for now, I am going to turn it over to my colleague, Con-
gressman Inslee, and allow him to ask a few questions. 

Representative INSLEE. Thank you. 
You  know,  this  is  very  disturbing  because,  unfortunately,  it  has 
confirmed  what  I  have  been  hearing  since  May  5,  1996,  when  we 
brought  these  scientists  up  and  really  dropped  this  bomb  on  Con-
gress. And Mr. Bishop, you have been worried about this for a cou-
ple  of  weeks.  I  have  been  worried  about  it  for  a  couple  of  years 
now, and the news gets worse. 

Basically, nature is seriously out of whack is what you are telling 
us.  From  an  acidification  standpoint,  the  ocean  is  on  fire,  and  we 
need  to  respond  as  if  there  is  a  fire  and  we  are  not  responding  as 
if  there  is  even  a  drizzle.  And  that  is  why  I  am  hopeful  that  with 
your testimony, Senator Cantwell and I can make sure that others 
hear about it. It is very, very disturbing. 

Several  things  I  want  to  make  sure  that  people  understand  is 
clear,  is  it  not,  that  climate  change  is  separate  from  acidification? 
In  other  words,  even  if  the  Flat  Earth  Society  is  right  and  there 
is  no  climate  change  going  on  or  if  it  is  not  caused  by  humans— 
even  if  the  Flat  Earth  Society  is  right—still  we  would  have  this 
clearly  scientific  consensus  that  the  oceans  are  becoming  signifi-
cantly  more  acidic  because  of  human-caused  CO2.  Does  everybody 
agree on that? Everybody agrees on it. 

I  want  to  give  people  a  sense  of  how  significant  that  is.  pH,  the 
acidic  scale,  is  a  logarithmic  scale  which  is  designed  to  trip  up 
sophomore physics students. But I have been told, I was looking at 
the NOAA literature, and it says—make sure that I read this right. 
The  NOAA  fact  sheet  on  this  says  that  the  oceans  have  absorbed 
50 percent of human-caused carbon dioxide. And it says, ‘‘This has 
caused  an  increase  in  hydrogen  ion  acidity  of  about  30  percent 
since  the  start  of  the  industrial  age  through  a  process  known  as 
ocean acidification.’’ 

Now could somebody just briefly describe if there is a 30 percent 
increase in acidification, the ions that are associated with acidifica-
tion,  why  does  it  only  show  a  tiny  little  change  in  the  logarithmic 
pH  of  the  ocean?  Just  very  briefly  so  that  the  Flat  Earth  Society 
can get this. 

Dr. SABINE. Why is everyone looking at me? OK. As you said, the 
pH scale is logarithmic. pH 7 is neutral. Numbers larger than 7 are 
bases  like  sodium  hydroxide  or  Alka-Seltzer.  Those  are  basic  com-
pounds.  Numbers  less  than  7  are  acidic  like  acids,  hydrochloric 
acid, or lemon juice is acidic. 

But  it  covers  such  a  wide  range  that  this  logarithmic  scale  ex-
plains  it.  It  is  the  concentration  of  hydrogen  ions  that  actually  af-
fects  the  chemistry,  and  so  it  depends  on  where  you  start.  The

oceans are actually slightly base. They had a pH—in the pre-indus-
trial  period,  they  had  a  pH  of  about  8.1.  Now  they  have  got  a  pH 
of about 8.0. So that is about 0.1 of a pH. But because of the loga-
rithmic scale, that represents about a 30 percent change in the ac-
tual concentration of hydrogen, the individual hydrogen ions. 

Representative  INSLEE.  Now,  as  a  layperson,  if  you  are  going  to 
have  a  30  percent  change  in  the  significant  part  of  the  acid-base 
relationship  of  the  water,  it  would  shock  me  if  there  wasn’t  very 
significant  changes  in  the  biology  of  the  ocean.  I  want  to  ask  you 
about what we know about that. 

In  the  NOAA  material  and  other  material,  I  have  read  that  we 
do  know  that  at  twice  pre-industrial  levels,  if  we  get  to  parts  per 
million  of  twice  pre-industrial  levels,  which  we  are  clearly  headed 
to  in  this  century  if  things  don’t  change,  and  more,  that  there 
would  be  as  much  as  an  80  percent  reduction  in  calcification  in 
some  coral  species  and  5  to  50  percent  reduction  in  calcification, 
the  ability  to  form  calcium,  the  structural  part  of  these  organisms 
associated with this? Are those about the right numbers? 

Dr. SABINE. Yes. 
Representative  INSLEE.  So  if  I  told  you  that  humans  were  going 
to  have  an  80  percent  reduction  in  our  ability  to  form  bones,  the 
calcification process, I think that would be pretty disturbing to peo-
ple if that happened within this century. 

Isn’t it fair to say from the science we know today, that is a dis-

tinct possibility for the organisms that live in the sea? 

Dr.  SABINE.  For  the  organisms  that  specifically  produce  calcium 

carbonate skeletons, yes. Now—I am sorry. 

Representative  INSLEE.  Yes.  So  here  is  what  is  disturbing,  the 
most  disturbing  thing  to  me  in  all  this.  With  all  due  respect  to 
clams  and  oysters—and  I  can  see—around  clams  and  oysters—the 
very basic bottom of the food chain are zooplankton, pteropods, and 
the  like.  All  the  life  in  the  ocean  is  based  upon  this  bottom  life  in 
the food chain. 

And  I  am  told  that  something  like  40  to  50  percent  of  all  those 
little organisms that are the basis, eventually up to the blue whale 
and orcas, have some calcification process involved in their system 
that  could  be  disrupted  by  the  somewhere  50  to  80  percent  reduc-
tion in calcification. Is that right? 

Dr. SABINE. Yes. 
Representative  INSLEE.  Now,  to  me,  that  just  scares  the  living 
heck  out  of  me.  We  get  7  to  10  percent  of  our  protein  from  the 
oceans. And from that, it seems to me that from what you are tell-
ing  us,  there  is  a  significant  chance  of  a  collapse  in  the  food  chain 
in the oceans. Is that what we are looking at as a possibility? 

Dr.  SABINE.  If  I  could  just  give  you  an  example?  We  did  a  study 
a  while  back  where  we  took  living  pteropods,  these  little  marine 
snails  that  float  around  in  the  ocean,  living  pteropods  out  of  the 
North Pacific and placed them into waters that coincidentally were 
very  similar  to  the  waters  that  we  saw  being  upwelled  off  of  the 
northern  California  coast  this  last  summer.  So,  high  CO2 waters, 
and  we  actually  saw  the  shells  dissolving  off  of  these  living  orga-
nisms.  They  were  dissolving  off  of  the  pteropods  as  they  were 
swimming around.

These pteropods have been shown to comprise as much as 40 per-
cent  of  Pacific  pink  salmon  diet.  So,  yes,  if  we  don’t  know  exactly 
how  all  the  ecosystems  are  going  to  respond  because  there  is  a 
complex assembly to all kinds of different types of organisms. Some 
of  them  do  not  produce  calcium-permeable  skeletons.  But  we  cer-
tainly  will  change  the  ecosystem  structure,  and  that  will  have  im-
pacts on our food chain. 

Representative INSLEE. Dr. Klinger? 
Dr.  KLINGER.  I  would  like  to  add,  in  response  to  your  question, 
that  it  is  not  just  a  problem  of  calcification  or  lack  of  calcification. 
As  we  change  the  concentration  of  hydrogen  ions  in  the  water,  in 
the  surface  waters,  and  as  we  change  the  concentration  of  calcium 
ions that we haven’t really talked much about that yet, that has— 
well,  it  could  have  profound  effects  on  the  physiology  of  calcified 
and non-calcified organisms. 

So ion flux across membranes could disrupt basic biological func-
tions  even  in  non-calcified  organisms,  and  this  is  an  area  of  re-
search I think we really need to pursue actively. 

In regard to your comment about collapse of food chains, my own 
opinion  is  that  we  won’t  see  a  total  collapse  of  food  chains,  but  we 
will  see  substitutions,  changes  in  the—we  may  end  up  with  food 
chains  or  food  webs  that  are  highly  undesirable  and  are  not  pro-
ductive for the needs that we use them today. 

Representative INSLEE. I can tell you that my constituents do not 
relish a sport season for jellyfish as a substitute for a sport season 
for salmon. So I share your sentiment. 

Dr.  KLINGER.  That  is  right.  So  the  food  webs  could  be  radically 

different. 

Representative  INSLEE.  Well,  I  could  tell  you  if  Al  Qaeda  had 
some  bomb  that  could  cause  a  potential  collapse  of  the  food  chain, 
the U.S. Congress would be active. And I hope that we start to act 
on  this.  I  have  much  more  questions,  but  I  will  defer  to  the  Sen-
ator. 

Senator CANTWELL. Dr. Miles, let us talk a little bit about a solu-
tion as it relates to just the fisheries management side of the equa-
tion.  And  obviously,  there  are  many  elements  to  this.  But  you 
touched  on  a  little  bit  in  your  testimony  about  specific  challenges, 
what  should  we  do  to  start  managing  our  fisheries  different  rel-
ative to ocean acidification? 

Dr.  MILES.  Four  things  I  can  think  of.  Biology  is  the  big  hole  at 
the  moment  with  respect  to  the  acidification  problem.  We  know 
very  little.  In  specificity,  we  know  a  few  things.  But  there  needs 
to be a really major research effort on this particular problem, look-
ing  at  it  in  whole  regional  ecosystem  context.  And  I  think  that  is 
the objective behind the initiative of the National Research Council 
to produce a research agenda to respond to this problem. Congress-
man Inslee is aware of that, which is great. 

In the meantime, we can’t wait for that to happen. Adopt, as Dr. 
Koenings  said,  adopt  a  risk  management  approach  to  managing 
fisheries, and there are a number of ways that one can adopt a risk 
management approach, and I am not going to try to sell you on any 
single  approach  here.  But  when  you  look  at  the  combination  of 
multiple  stressors,  the  decisions  that  will  have  to  be  made  will

43 

have  adverse  effects  on  the  way  fisheries  are  currently—commer-
cial fisheries are currently organized. 

The third thing is reduce stressors. Take, for instance, you asked 
about  salmon  in  Puget  Sound.  Well,  we  know  that  they  will  face, 
as  a  result  of  shoaling,  an  undersaturated  horizon  during  the 
upwelling  period,  say,  between  April  and  September.  That  is  not 
the only major challenge. Climate change is, (a) increasing the tem-
perature  of  the  streams  and,  (b)  is  reducing  the  water,  the  stream 
flow  that  they  require.  So  that  by  August,  September,  they  are  in 
trouble. How do we deal with that problem, which is a very serious 
problem in Washington State, the future of the streams for migrat-
ing salmon in the summer. 

Then  they  will  get  to  the  Sound  in,  say,  from  May  to  June,  and 
they  will  meet  additional  stressors,  and  we  have  to  regard  then 
land  use  planning  as  a  little  different  part  of  fishery  planning.  So 
you  look  at  the  population  growth  rates  for  some  of  the  time,  and 
you  look  at  the  way  the  coastal  development  is  proceeding,  that  is 
another problem with salmon and other species. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  You  are  saying  land  use  planning  as  it  re-

lates to pollutants, stressors? 

Dr.  MILES.  And  things  like  temperatures  will  be  what  we,  you 
know—all of those things will really matter. The last thing we need 
to do is—— 

Senator  CANTWELL.  So  things  of  that  nature  that  will  allow 

water to flow directly back into? 

Dr.  MILES.  —and  the  last  thing  we  have  to  do  is  to  monitor  so 
that we know what is happening as it is happening. And the initial 
attempt  to  monitor  with  respect  to  carbon  in  the  Puget  Sound  is 
collaboration between Mr. Sabine’s group, the lab at the University 
of  Washington,  and  some  others.  But  that  is  just  the  beginning.  It 
didn’t exist before. 

We  have  to  do  this  systematically.  It  is  risk  management,  mul-
tiple  stress,  awareness  on  action,  and  yes,  ecosystem  risk  manage-
ment.  But  we  have  to  worry  about  the  rate  of  change,  and  it  may 
be  as  Dr.  Klinger  implied  that  the  ecosystem  we  have  now  is  not 
the ecosystem we will have 10 years from now. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  And  then  when  you  are  talking  about  risk 
management  strategies,  just—and  I  know  you  didn’t  want  to  focus 
on any one in particular, but what is different in that scenario than 
what we are doing today? 

Dr.  MILES.  Oh,  take,  for  instance,  the  Germans,  they  have  pro-

posed, their scientists have proposed a system of guardrails. 

Senator CANTWELL. Of what? 
Dr. MILES. Guardrails. 
Senator CANTWELL. OK. 
Dr.  MILES.  These  are  quantitatively  defined  standards  that  set 
the  picture  from—that  imply  what  changes  we  have  to  make  to 
prevent the increase in the global climate, global temperature, pre-
vent that exceeding, say, 2.5 degrees centigrade. Whatever it takes 
to do that, you have to do to get—— 

Senator  CANTWELL.  So  a  much  higher  standard  than  what  we 

have been talking about as far as they had legislation—— 

Dr.  MILES.  —then  they  have  calculated  what  it  will  take  to  pre-
vent the increase of acidification beyond certain levels in an annual

44 

range, and that would be another one. And there are three or four 
of these examples, but that is one approach to managing. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  —guardrails  sounds  like  a  good  idea  to  me. 
We should at least be pursuing that strategy as it relates to impact 
and evolving the legislation. 

One area we haven’t talked about yet in much detail is obviously 
the impact of the warming of our oceans and waters and the actual 
sea  level  rise  and  the  impact  that  it  could  have  on  lowlands  and 
wetlands  in  Washington  State.  Now  there  are  some  projections 
here for the size of the rise in the next 20 to 30 years. 

Dr.  Koenings,  we  have  something—I  don’t  know  if  this  is  your 
expertise, or I am not sure who on the panel has the answer to this 
as  it  relates  to  the  impact  for  us  as  a  region?  What  are  some  of 
the things that we should be undertaking now? 

Dr.  KOENINGS.  Well,  I  think  there  will  be  some  drastic  impacts. 
For  example,  the  agriculture  industry  would  be  susceptible  to 
large-scale  changes  in  water  fluctuation  and  water  levels.  Myself, 
I took it seriously. I bought at home a 50-[inaudible] tank. So I am 
pretty  safe  on  that.  But  it  is  not  really  my  area  of  expertise  in 
terms  of  going  into  the  actual  dynamics  of  what  a  sea  level  rise 
may be other than backing up the areas. 

But  if  I  could  make  one  comment  on  some  previous  testimony? 
The  big  fear  that  I  have  as  we  go  into  this  whole  reaction  to  the 
acidification, global warming changes, et cetera, is you get into the 
paralysis  by  analysis.  There  isn’t  enough  connection.  There  isn’t 
enough certainty. There isn’t enough data populating our models to 
make  accurate  predictions  of  what  may,  in  fact,  be  in  front  of  us. 
But  yet  we  are  already,  I  think,  seeing  changes  that  are  going 
on that lead us to believe that we need to take action. That is what 
I  said  before.  We  need  to  be  really  precautionary  in  terms  of  our 
resource  management  because  we  don’t  know  what  the  future  has 
in front of us. But we do know something is going on, and we can’t 
wait  to  take  action  until  our  models  are  populated,  until  we  vali-
date our predictions and those kind of things. 

That  is  a  hard  thing  for  people  to  accept.  It  is  a  hard  thing  to 
make  change  when  you  don’t  have  the  basic  science  to  say  that 
here is the causal connection. 

But yet things are happening that lead us to believe we have got 
to take the steps, and that is one thing that the government wants 
us to do is to go ahead and make sure there is environmental sus-
tainability  here  in  Washington  for  the  future  by  being  bold  and 
taking those steps. 

Senator CANTWELL. Dr. Klinger, Dr. Sabine, do you want to com-
ment on sea level rise or what we need to do to plan for that? And 
obviously, we have quite a few areas here in Washington State that 
would be impacted. 

Dr.  KLINGER.  I  am  not  an  expert  on  the  sea  level  rise.  From  a 
biological standpoint or an ecological standpoint, it is likely that we 
will  see  a  shift  in  nearshore  habitats  and  in  the  distribution  of 
those  habitats.  Those—at  least  some  of  those  shifts  are  likely  to 
negatively  impact  communities—marine  communities  that  we 
value. 

So  I  think  we  have  to  be  smarter.  I  think  we  have  to  engage  in 
protection  of  the  habitats  that  we  have  now.  And  we  may  have  to

45 

come up with some really innovative restoration strategies that are 
sort  of  more  forward-thinking  than  those  that  we  have  imple-
mented so far. 

Dr. SABINE. I am also not an expert on sea level rise, but I would 
just like to add the fact that the oceans actually contain the major-
ity of the heat at the surface of the Earth. The increasing tempera-
tures, most of that heat is being absorbed into the oceans, and the 
oceans have tremendous momentum. 

So even if we were to make changes today that would change the 
temperature  of  the  planet,  there  is  so  much  momentum  in  the  ab-
sorption  of  the  heat  and  consequences  of  that  are  thermal  expan-
sion—the  expansion  of  the  oceans,  which  increase  the  sea  level— 
that the ocean sea levels will continue to rise over centuries to per-
haps  millennia  as  a  result  of  what  we  are  doing  right  now,  today, 
even if we were to stop it. 

So I think we need to study and evaluate what the consequences 
of this will be because there is such a tremendous momentum that 
once  you  have  got  that  ball  rolling,  once  sea  level  is  rising,  it  will 
continue, and you can’t stop it. 

And I just also would like to comment on the previous statement 
about  the  acting  while  we  still  have  large  uncertainties.  And  that 
is just to reiterate the point that I believe you made, Congressman 
Inslee, that while there are many uncertainties associated with the 
ecosystem  responses  to  ocean  acidification,  ocean  acidification  is  a 
very  clear  consequence  of  rising  atmospheric  CO2.  And  the  chem-
istry is irrefutable. 

We  are  measuring  those  changes,  and  we  know  that  they  are 
happening  and  that  will  also  continue  as  long  as  CO2 is.  So  that 
is not really a matter for debate. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  But  then  we  should  be  planning  appro-
priately  and  particularly  you  are  saying  no  matter  what  we  do,  if 
sea  level  rises,  the  temperature  is  going  to  continue,  I  don’t  know. 
Some  statistics  I  have  seen  say  40,000  to  50,000  Washingtonians 
could  be  displaced  by  this,  to  say  nothing  of  the  impact  it  could 
have  on  Mr.  Bishop  and  other  shellfish  growers  in  the  industry. 
But it seems to me if that is inevitable, no matter what we do mov-
ing forward, we ought to have better plans in place to address that. 
Dr.  SABINE.  That  is  right.  But  I  also  go  back  to  what  Dr. 
Koenings  pointed  out,  which  is  the  rate  of  change  is  also  critically 
important here. That while we can’t at this point stop the sea level 
rise,  and  it  is  likely  to  take  a  long  time  to  deal  with  rising  CO2, 
that even just reducing the rate at which we are changing can have 
a tremendous impact on the resulting consequences. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you. 
Congressman Inslee? 
Representative INSLEE. Mr. Ranker, do you have something more 

to add? 

Mr. RANKER. Just very quickly, specific to your original question, 
Senator Cantwell, regarding the impact of sea level rise, something 
that  we  haven’t  discussed  as  much  that  was  mentioned  briefly  in 
a  couple  of  testimonies  is  the  changes  in  fresh  water  flows  which 
dramatically  impacts  our  aquifer  recharge.  So  when  we  start  look-
ing  at  sea  level  rise,  there  are  two  other  impacts  that  we  need  to 
consider and consider very seriously.

One  is  the  ability  of  our  fresh  water  systems  from  our  snow 
packs,  rivers,  and  lakes  with  regard  to  aquifer  recharge,  which  is 
the drinking water supply for most Washington citizens. The other 
thing that we are experiencing in the San Juan Islands now is the 
very  harsh  reality  of  salt  water  intrusion  on  our  wells.  Except  for 
central  Puget  Sound,  the  majority  of  our  homeowners  have  their 
own  wells,  and  in  south  Sound,  north  Sound,  and  particularly  out 
on the open ocean coast. And if you see even the slightest sea level 
rise,  you  significantly  raise  the  chances  of  salt  water  intrusion  on 
your wells. 

As a past member of my county board of health, the harsh news 
is  if  you  go  above  a  certain  percentage  regarding  salt  water  intru-
sion, you have got to shut down. There is not an alternative, except 
for  the  bottled  water  and  bring  it  in.  We  have  some  people  on  the 
outer Sound who are doing that by the truckload. It is costing them 
29  cents  a  gallon  for  their  own  water.  So  that  is  another  impact 
that hasn’t been touched on today. 

Representative INSLEE. Thanks. I am reading a book called ‘‘The 
Most  Important  Fish  in  the  Sea.’’  It  is  about  the  collapse  of  the 
Manhattan stocks in the Atlantic. And it was pointed out that New 
York  Harbor  used  to  have  a  really  productive—biologically,  it  was 
very, very productive. All kinds of, I think there were—— 

And  listening  to  these  multiple  stressors,  increased  temperature 
in our streams and the Hood Canal dead zone, increase in acidifica-
tion,  changes  in  the  hydrological  cycle,  if  things  do  not  change,  if 
we  continue  on  this  course  of  acidification,  the  warming,  changes 
in  our  hydrological  cycle,  would  there  come  a  point  or  could  there 
become a point where we suffer the same biological decline as New 
York Harbor, eventually? 

Dr.  KOENINGS.  I  think  that  is  a  very  good  question,  and  that  is 
one of the things that certainly we here in the State of Washington 
are  trying  to  avoid  by  setting  up  a  whole  new  agency  dealing 
with—under  Governor  Gregoire’s  leadership,  a  whole  agency  that 
deals  with  Puget  Sound.  And  you  are  very  familiar  with  that.  You 
are one of the leaders of that as well. 

So  one  of  the  things  we  are  trying  to  do,  of  course,  is  to  set  up 
so we avoid that kind of fate, and we somehow can restructure, re-
shape, and reform what we do in Puget Sound so that we don’t get 
into  the  fix  that  we  are  in  in  terms  of  the  New  York  Harbor  and 
some  of  the  other  industrial  areas  around  the  country,  the  Chesa-
peake  Bay,  down  in  Florida,  Louisiana,  California.  They  have  all 
suffered sort of the same kind of fate. And we are determined here 
in Washington to avoid that. 

Representative  INSLEE.  We  appreciate  the  Governor’s  leadership 
on  that.  I  want  to  talk  about  on  a  larger  basis  what  we  have  to 
do  to  skin  this  cat.  I  really  appreciate  that  you  have  very  prudent 
resource  management.  We  have  got  to  guard  against  uncertainty. 
But  I  am  going  to  lay  the  cards  on  the  table.  As  long  as  we  are 
putting out megatons of carbon dioxide, we are just sort of doomed 
in  these  biological  systems  no  matter  how  good  a  job  we  do  in  the 
fishery and the management and the like. 

And  I  just  want  to  talk  about  what  we  have  to  do  to  solve  this 
problem. I had said earlier that we could have an 80 percent reduc-
tion  in  calcification  if  we  get  to  twice  the  parts  per  million  as  in 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Jul 24, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75204.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

47 

pre-industrial times. That is about 450 parts per million, which we 
are headed to in this century if things do not change. 

I  have  been  told  that  to  stop  at  that  level,  to  stop  the  rise  at 
twice the pre-industrial levels, we in the industrialized world have 
to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by about 80 percent per cap-
ita simply to stop the runaway freight train before we are past the 
point  of  twice  pre-industrial  levels  that  we  know  is  going  to  have 
adverse consequences. 

And  so,  I  mean  each  of  us  have  to  reduce  our  carbon  footprint 
by  four-fifths  by  the  year  2050  to  prevent  going  past  twice  pre-in-
dustrialized  levels.  Is  that  a  fair  assessment  on  what  we  need  to 
be  shooting  at  to  really  solve  this  problem,  or  should  we  have  dif-
ferent targets of emission? 

Mr.  BISHOP.  Trying  to  come  to  grips  with  this  huge  problem  of 
ocean  acidification  strikes  me  is  like  trying  to  fight  a  beach  ball 
that  is  so  big  you  can’t  get  a  grip  on  it.  You  likened  it  to  a  bomb. 
The  knowledge  of  what  is  coming  is  like  a  bomb.  The  old  saying 
is  that  the  pen  is  mightier  than  the  sword.  I  would  like  to  think 
that  ideas  can  be  more  powerful  than  laws.  This  is  how  it  would 
have to work. 

Shellfish  growers  measure  progress  on  design,  and  that  is  the 
way this problem has to be dealt with—land use regulations, daily 
behavior  changes.  We  have  to  grind  away  at  it.  You  have  to  know 
what  you  are  doing  and  which  direction  you  are  going  to  go,  but 
it can’t be solved in one fell swoop. 

What  it  means  to  me  personally  is  that  we  have  7  years  left  on 
our  mortgage.  I  would  like  to  be  able  to  grow  shellfish  for  at  least 
7 more years. 

Representative  INSLEE.  Anyone  else?  Dr.  Miles,  are  those  num-

Dr.  MILES.  Yes,  but  a  world  of  500  ppm  is  a  world  of  enormous 

bers about right? 

environmental disruption. 

Representative INSLEE. So even if we reduce our emissions by 80 
percent  by  2050,  we  are  still  going  to  suffer  significant  environ-
mental damage? Is that right? 

Dr. MILES. Yes. Yes. 
Representative  INSLEE.  Which,  to  me,  is  not  a  reason  for  inac-
tion,  it  is  a  reason  for  hastening  the  action.  The  fact  that  we  are 
in  difficult  straits  means  that  we  should  be  acting  sooner  rather 
than  later.  And  I  can  tell  you  that  I  am  optimistic  in  our  ability 
to do that. 

I  have  been  working  on  something  called  New  Apollo  Energy 
Project, which basically says that we need a new technological base 
rather than our carbon-based system. I believe we can achieve that. 
Senator  Cantwell  has  been  doing  incredible  work  in  the  Senate  to 
develop one. 

And if we do that, if we use the optimistic attitude of Americans 
and  the  intellectual  capital  that  is  available  to  us,  we  are  going  to 
solve  this  problem.  I  believe  that.  If  the  U.S.  Congress  acts.  And 
I just want to thank you for your efforts. We are going to share this 
information as widely as possible. We will get that Flat Earth Soci-
ety to wake up yet. 

Thank you. 
Somebody wants to—Dr. Klinger?

Dr.  KLINGER.  I  would  just  like  to  comment.  Dr.  Sabine  brought 
up  the  concept  of  rate  and  rates  of  change,  and  although  we  can’t 
likely  reverse  the  changes  that  we  have  set  in  motion,  if  we  slow 
the  rate  at  which  we  are  changing  the  environment,  then  we  give 
the organisms a chance to evolve and adapt to those changes. 

So adaptation may be a potential where genetic evolution is very 
rate  dependent.  The  slower  you  go,  the  more  likely  we  are  that 
some organisms may be able to adapt and adjust to these new envi-
ronmental  conditions.  So  rates  are  important,  and  we  should  slow 
down. 

Representative INSLEE. So our theory or our sort of motif should 

be give the clams a chance. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  I  would  thank  again  the  staff  of  the 
aquarium  and  John  Braden  for  hosting  us  being  here,  and  obvi-
ously my colleague, Congressman Inslee, for being here and adding 
his expertise and knowledge to this. And certainly, this information 
is free to be shared with the House of Representatives as well. 

And I want to thank the Commerce Committee staff for traveling 
here and staffing the hearing this weekend. As you can see, we pro-
duced a little Northwest sunshine as part of that. 

I  want  to  thank  the  witnesses  especially.  Thank  you  for  illu-
minating  this  issue,  which  for  many  people  today  have  been  hear-
ing  about  the  impacts  of  global  warming  and  the  climate  change, 
and  yet  I  feel  that  the  oceans  have  been  missing  in  the  discussion 
or at least not in the limelight that they really need to have, given 
the  significant  impact  and  damage  that  has  already  been  done 
today,  the  challenges  that  that  puts  forth  in  front  of  us  to  save 
these various fisheries and to save the health of our oceans. 

So I want to thank you for being leaders in your fields and help-
ing us illuminate this issue. Mr. Bishop and Mr. Ranker, thank you 
for your uniquely local perspective. I know these are big challenges. 
I  know  that  given  the  consequence  of  what  could  happen  to  our 
oceans’  food  chain,  what  could  happen  to  the  health  of  the  oceans 
overall, it does seem quite daunting. 

But,  Mr.  Bishop,  you  remind  me,  we  had  an  FCC  Commissioner 
who just died recently, Newton Minnow, who, when he was taking 
John Kennedy around NASA, the President said to him, ‘‘how come 
we aren’t launching men into—astronauts into orbit instead of sat-
ellites?’’  And  Mr.  Minnow  said,  ‘‘well,  we  are  launching  the  sat-
ellites because ideas last longer than people do.’’ 

And I think your notion that there are ingenious ideas that could 
help us and that we have to put the American scientific community 
to task at that, I think, is really the focus of this hearing. 

While we have introduced legislation on adaptation, on acidifica-
tion, and we will be having a debate next week when we come back 
on  global  climate  change  and  legislation  moving  forward,  I  think 
that  the  health  of  our  oceans  are  in  such  peril  that  it  takes  much 
more  aggressive  action  than  we  have  currently  put  forth  in  the 
U.S. Senate. 

So  I  thank  the  Northwest  for  helping  me  to  paint  a  picture  of 
this  that  is  very  clear  and  very  challenging,  but  we  are  a  place  of 
ideas, and we should not be daunted by this task. We look forward 
to working with all of you in the future.
