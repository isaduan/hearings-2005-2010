Overview of Geothermal Energy
Hydrothermal Systems

Geothermal  energy  is  heat  from  the  Earth’s  core  that  is  trapped  in  the  Earth’s
crust.  In  locations  where  high  temperatures  coincide  with  naturally-occurring,  un-
derground,  fluid-filled  reservoirs,  the  resulting  hot  water  or  steam  can  be  tapped
and  used  either  to  generate  electricity  or  for  direct  use  (e.g.,  heating  buildings,
greenhouses,  or  aquaculture  operations).  Such  locations  are  referred  to  as  hydro-
thermal  (hot  water)  resources,  and  they  have  been  the  focus  of  traditional  geo-
thermal energy development.

By  tapping  hydrothermal  resources,  the  United  States  has  become  the  world’s
largest  producer  of  electric  power  from  geothermal  energy.  About  2,800  megawatts
(MW)  of  geothermal  electrical  generating  capacity  is  connected  to  the  grid  in  the
United  States;  8,000  MW  of  geothermal  generating  capacity  is  installed  worldwide.
Geothermal energy is currently the third largest source of renewably-generated grid
power  in  the  United  States,  behind  hydropower  and  biomass.  In  2003,  it  accounted
for  seven  percent  of  U.S.  electricity  generated  from  renewable  sources.  The  largest
geothermal development in the world is at The Geysers in Northern California. This
series  of  plants,  which  started  to  come  online  in  1960,  has  a  cumulative  capacity
of  over  850  MW  and  satisfies  nearly  70  percent  of  the  average  electrical  demand
for the California North Coast region.

Although the United States is the world leader in hydrothermal development, sig-
nificant  potential  remains  untapped.  The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  has  esti-
mated  there  to  be  22,000  MW  of  hydrothermal  resources  sufficient  for  electrical
power  generation  in  the  United  States.  However,  many  of  these  resources  remain
hidden and unconfirmed. H.R. 2304 contains provisions to support research and de-
velopment  of  advanced  technologies  to  assist  in  locating  and  characterizing  hidden
hydrothermal  resources,  and  to  encourage  demonstration  of  advanced  exploration
technologies by the geothermal industry.

Enhanced (or Engineered) Geothermal Systems (EGS)

Enhanced  Geothermal  Systems  (EGS)  differ  from  hydrothermal  systems  in  that
they  lack  either  a  natural  reservoir  (i.e.,  the  cracks  and  spaces  in  the  rock  through
which  fluid  can  circulate),  the  fluid  to  circulate  through  the  reservoir,  or  both.  In
EGS  development,  sometimes  referred  to  as  ‘‘heat  mining,’’  an  injection  well  is
drilled to a depth where temperatures are sufficiently high; if necessary, a reservoir
is  created,  or  ‘‘cracked,’’  in  the  rock  by  using  one  of  various  methods  of  applying
pressure; and a fluid is introduced to circulate through the reservoir and absorb the

heat.  The  fluid  is  extracted  through  a  production  well,  the  heat  is  extracted  to  run
a  geothermal  power  plant  or  for  some  direct  use  application,  and  the  fluid  is  re-in-
jected to start the loop all over again.

Although  it  has  been  the  subject  of  preliminary  investigations  in  the  United
States, Europe, and Australia, the EGS concept has yet to be demonstrated as com-
mercially  viable.  However,  experts  familiar  with  the  resource  and  the  associated
technologies believe the technical and economic hurdles are surmountable. In Janu-
ary,  2007,  a  panel  led  by  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  produced  a  re-
port entitled The Future of Geothermal Energy, which contained an updated assess-
ment  of  EGS  potential  in  the  United  States.  The  authors  of  the  report  estimated
the  Nation’s  total  EGS  resource  base  to  be  ‘‘greater  than  13  million  quads  or
130,000  times  the  current  annual  consumption  of  primary  energy  in  the  United
States.’’ 1 After accounting for the fact that the actual amount of recoverable energy
will be much lower, due to technical and economic constraints, the authors conserv-
atively estimate that two percent of the EGS resource could be economically recover-
able—an amount that is still more than 2,000 times larger than all the primary en-
ergy  consumed  in  the  United  States  in  2005.2 In  other  words,  if  the  technological
hurdles to EGS development can be overcome, the potential of the resource is enor-
mous.  H.R.  2304  contains  provisions  to  support  research  and  development  of  ad-
vanced  technologies  to  advance  the  commercial  viability  of  EGS  development,  and
to encourage demonstration of reservoir engineering and stimulation technologies by
the geothermal industry.

Applications of Geothermal Energy
• Electric  power:  Geothermal  power  plants  pump  hot  fluid  (usually  water  or  brine)
from  the  Earth  and  either  use  it  to  power  a  turbine  directly,  or  run  it  through
a  heat  exchanger  to  boil  a  secondary  fluid  into  a  gas,  which  then  powers  a  tur-
bine, to create electricity.
• Direct use applications: Geothermal water of at least 70°F can be used directly for
heating  homes  or  offices,  growing  plants  in  greenhouses,  heating  water  for  fish
farming,  and  for  other  industrial  uses.  Some  cities  (e.g.,  Boise,  Idaho)  pipe  geo-
thermal hot water under roads and sidewalks to keep them clear of snow and ice.
District  heating  applications  use  networks  of  piped  hot  water  to  heat  buildings
throughout a community.

Benefits of Geothermal Energy
• Base load power: Unlike most renewable energy sources, electric power from geo-
thermal  energy  is  available  at  a  constant  level,  24  hours  a  day.  Because  of  this
lack  of  intermittency,  geothermal  power  may  provide  baseload  power  production.
• Pollution prevention: A geothermal steam plant emits almost 50 times less carbon
dioxide  (CO2)  than  the  average  U.S.  coal  power  plant  per  kilowatt  of  electricity
produced.3 Every  year,  geothermal  electricity  plants  prevent  4.1  million  tons  of
CO2 emissions  that  coal-powered  plants  would  have  generated.  A  geothermal
plant’s  cooling  towers  emit  mostly  water  vapor,  and  emit  no  particulates,  hydro-
gen  sulfide,  or  nitrogen  oxides.  Plants  that  employ  binary  conversion  technology
emit only water vapor, and in very small amounts.
• Jobs  and  security:  Geothermal  energy  can  be  produced  domestically,  thereby  pro-
viding jobs for Americans and reducing security concerns associated with depend-
ence on foreign sources of oil and natural gas. The large size of the resource, both
in  the  United  States  and  overseas,  creates  significant  market  opportunities  for
geothermal technology companies.

Cost

Electricity from The Geysers sells for a wholesale price of $0.03 to $0.035 per kilo-
watt-hour  (kWh),  while  electricity  from  newer  geothermal  plants  (using  lower  tem-
perature  resources)  costs  between  $0.05  and  $0.08  wholesale  per  kWh.  Wholesale
prices  for  electricity  produced  from  EGS  reservoirs  is  likely  to  be  higher  in  the  ini-
tial  stages  of  developing  the  technology,  but  projections  by  the  MIT  panel  that  pro-
duced The Future of Geothermal Energy anticipate that it would fall to a comparable
level  (i.e.,  $0.05  to  $0.08  per  kWh)  by  the  time  a  100  MW  of  cumulative  capacity

have  been  developed  in  the  United  States,  which  amounts  to  bringing  only  a  few
EGS projects online.4

Direct  use  of  geothermal  resources  is  cost-competitive  in  many  applications.  For
example,  according  to  DOE,  commercial  greenhouses  heated  with  geothermal  re-
sources, instead of traditional energy sources, average an 80 percent savings on fuel
costs—about five to eight percent of average total operating costs.

Issues
• Subsidence  and  production  declines:  At  some  geothermal  power  plants,  energy
production  may  gradually  decline  over  time,  through  a  loss  of  water/steam  or  de-
clining  water  temperatures.  If  water  or  steam  is  removed  from  an  underground
reservoir,  the  land  above  the  reservoir  may  slowly  start  to  sink.  Municipalities
can  inject  their  treated  wastewater  into  the  underground  reservoir  to  replenish
the  hot  water  supply  and  avoid  land  subsidence.  Newer  geothermal  plants  tend
to  employ  binary  conversion  technology,  which  re-injects  the  geofluid  into  the
ground after extracting the heat, thereby replenishing the reservoir. Since almost
no  fluid  is  lost  in  these  systems,  reservoir  depletion  and  subsidence  are  less  sig-
nificant concerns.
• Induced  seismicity:  Good  hydrothermal  resources  usually  coincide  with  areas  of
volcanic  activity  and  so  are  almost  always  seismically  active  to  begin  with,  and
developing  a  geothermal  resource  can  cause  additional  earthquakes.  These  in-
duced  quakes  are  usually  small  and  imperceptible  by  humans,  registering  only
two  to  three  on  the  Richter  scale.  The  process  of  developing  EGS  resources  may
also  induce  some  seismic  activity  through  the  act  of  cracking  the  rock  to  create
an  underground  reservoir.  Experience  to  date  suggests  that  the  induced  quakes
from EGS development are also quite small, but this is an area that warrants fur-
ther study. H.R. 2304 calls for the Secretary of Energy to study induced seismicity
as a consequence of EGS development.
• Water  use:  Geothermal  projects  require  access  to  water  throughout  development
and  operation.  Water  is  used  during  well  drilling,  reservoir  stimulation,  and  cir-
culation. Cooling water is also used in most plants for condensing the hot working
fluid  after  it  has  powered  the  turbine.  In  locations  where  water  resources  are  in
high  demand,  as  in  the  western  U.S.,  water  use  for  geothermal  projects  requires
careful  management  and  conservation.  Steps  must  also  be  taken  to  ensure  that
geothermal  development  does  not  contaminate  groundwater  and  that  noxious
geofluids  that  are  produced  from  deep  wells  are  not  disposed  of  on  the  surface.

Geothermal Energy Programs at DOE

The United States has been involved in geothermal energy R&D since the 1970s.
The  program  reached  a  high  point  in  FY  1980  with  funding  of  approximately  $150
million (1980 dollars). Since then, funding has gradually declined to its present level
of $5 million (2007 dollars) in FY 2007.

Historically,  many  important  technological  advances  have  emerged  from  DOE-
supported  work  at  the  national  labs  and  U.S.  universities.  The  current  geothermal
program has allocated its FY 2007 budget of $5 million to support work on two EGS
development  projects,  assess  the  potential  of  using  hot  water  co-produced  with  oil
and  gas  drilling  to  produce  electricity,  and  to  close  down  remaining  program  oper-
ations and establish an historical archive of the program.

In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Section 931(a)(2)(C) included a broad authoriza-
tion for research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs
for geothermal energy, with a focus on ‘‘developing improved technologies for reduc-
ing  the  costs  of  geothermal  energy  installations,  including  technologies  for  (i)  im-
proving detection of geothermal resources; (ii) decreasing drilling costs; (iii) decreas-
ing  maintenance  costs  through  improved  materials;  (iv)  increasing  the  potential  for
other  revenue  sources,  such  as  mineral  production;  and  (v)  increasing  the  under-
standing of reservoir life cycle and management.’’

While  broad-ranging,  the  EPACT  authorization  lacks  specific  provisions  for  cost-
shared  programs  with  industry  partners  (which  have  led  to  many  advances  in  geo-
thermal technology in the past and facilitated adoption of those advances by the pri-
vate  sector)  and  it  makes  no  specific  mention  of  developing  Enhanced  Geothermal
Systems (EGS), an area of significant potential. Also, the authorization expires after
FY  2009.  Despite  the  authorization  in  EPACT  ’05,  the  Administration  requested
zero dollars for geothermal programs at DOE for FY 2007 and FY 2008 and is cur-
rently making plans to shut down the geothermal program.

As  justification  for  terminating  the  geothermal  program,  the  Administration  has
claimed  that  geothermal  technologies  are  mature—a  claim  disputed  by  geothermal
researchers and the industry. Recent indications suggest DOE officials may be open
to reexamining investment in geothermal R&D, particularly in light of the opportu-
nities  in  Enhanced  Geothermal  Systems  that  were  highlighted  in  the  recent  MIT
report: The Future of Geothermal Energy.

Overview of Marine Renewable Energy

Marine  Renewable  Energy  refers  to  energy  that  can  be  extracted  from  ocean
water. (In some contexts the term may also encompass offshore wind developments,
but  that  is  beyond  the  scope  of  H.R.  2313  and  this  hearing.)  For  purposes  of  H.R.
2313, the marine renewable energy refers to energy derived from ocean waves, tidal
flows,  ocean  currents,  or  ocean  thermal  gradients.  Each  is  these  is  described  in
greater detail below.

Moving  water  contains  a  much  higher  energy  concentration,  measured  in  watts
per meter (for waves) or watts per square meter (for tides and currents), than other
renewable resources, such as wind and solar. This creates an opportunity to extract
comparable  amounts  of  energy  with  a  smaller  apparatus.  The  challenge  lies  in  de-
veloping  technologies  to  effectively  and  efficiently  harness  the  energy  contained  in
ocean  movement  or  thermal  gradients  and  use  it  to  generate  electric  power,  or  for
other purposes.

Their potential debated for many years, marine renewable energy technologies ap-
pear  to  be  on  the  verge  of  a  technological  breakthrough.  Prototypes  or  small  dem-
onstration installations have recently been hooked into the power grid in Australia,
Portugal,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  United  States.  H.R.  2313  would  support
technology research and development to ensure that U.S. companies are competitive
in this emerging global market, and that emerging technologies are developed in an
environmentally sensitive way.
• Waves: Ocean waves are really a super concentrated form of solar energy. The sun
makes  the  wind  blow,  and  the  wind  blowing  across  the  ocean  surface  creates
waves.  Waves  may  travel  unimpeded  through  the  ocean  for  thousands  of  miles,
accruing  significant  amounts  of  mechanical  energy.  Wave  power  devices  extract
energy  directly  from  surface  waves  or  from  pressure  fluctuations  below  the  sur-
face.
According  to  a  study  by  the  Electric  Power  Research  Institute  (EPRI),5 the  total
annual  wave  energy  resource  in  the  United  States  is  approximately  2,300  TWh
per year (2,300 terawatt hours = 2,300 billion kilowatt hours). If we were to har-
ness  24  percent  of  that  resource,  at  50  percent  efficiency,  it  would  generate  an
amount of electricity roughly comparable to all of our current output from hydro-
electric  sources  (∼270  TWh  per  year,  or  approximately  seven  percent  of  current
U.S. electricity generation6 ).
Wave-power rich areas of the world include the western coasts of Scotland, north-
ern  Canada,  southern  Africa,  Australia,  and  the  northeastern  and  northwestern
coasts  of  the  United  States.  In  the  Pacific  Northwest  alone,  DOE  estimates  that
wave  energy  could  produce  40–70  kilowatts  (kW)  per  meter  (3.3  feet)  of  western
coastline.7
Wave energy can be converted into electricity through either offshore and onshore
systems.  Offshore  systems  are  situated  in  deep  water,  typically  between  40  and
70 meters (131 and 230 feet). Most offshore systems take the form either of a sin-
gle  point  absorber,  which  is  a  vertical  buoy  design,  similar  in  appearance  to  a
navigation buoy, or an attenuator, which is a long, segmented tube that generates
energy  as  waves  flow  along  its  length,  flexing  the  adjacent  segments  against  one
another and powering hydraulic pumps inside.
Onshore  wave  energy  systems  are  situated  on  the  shoreline  and  exposed  to  on-
coming  waves.  Oscillating  water  column  designs  enclose  a  column  of  air  above  a
column  of  water.  As  waves  enter  the  air  column,  they  cause  the  water  column
to rise and fall, alternately compressing and depressurizing the air column, which
powers  a  turbine.  The  tapchan,  or  tapered  channel  system,  consists  of  a  tapered
channel,  which  feeds  into  a  reservoir  constructed  on  cliffs  above  sea  level.  The

narrowing  of  the  channel  causes  the  waves  to  increase  in  height  as  they  move
toward  the  cliff  face.  The  waves  spill  over  the  walls  of  the  channel  into  the  res-
ervoir  and  the  stored  water  is  then  fed  through  a  turbine.  Pendulor  devices  con-
sist  of  a  rectangular  box,  which  is  open  to  the  sea  at  one  end.  A  flap  is  hinged
over  the  opening  and  the  action  of  the  waves  causes  the  flap  to  swing  back  and
forth, powering a hydraulic pump and a generator.

• Tidal  Flows:  Tides  are  controlled  primarily  by  the  Moon,  and  so  can  legitimately
be thought of as lunar power. As the tides rise and fall twice each day, they create
tidal currents in coastal locations with fairly narrow passages. Good examples in-
clude  San  Francisco’s  Golden  Gate,  the  Tacoma  Narrows  in  Washington’s  Puget
Sound,  and  coastal  areas  of  Alaska  and  Maine.  Technologies  of  various  designs
may be used to harness these flows.
Many  tidal  turbines  look  like  wind  turbines,  and  engineers  of  tidal  technologies
have  been  able  to  draw  on  many  of  the  lessons  learned  from  30  years  of  wind-
turbine  development.  They  may  be  arrayed  underwater  in  rows,  anchored  to  the
sea floor. Because the energy in moving water is so much more concentrated than
the  energy  in  moving  air,  the  turbines  can  be  much  smaller  than  wind  turbines
and  still  generate  comparable  amounts  of  electricity.  The  turbines  function  best
where  coastal  currents  run  at  between  3.6  and  4.9  knots  (four  and  5.5  mph).  In
currents of that speed, a 15-meter (49.2 feet) diameter tidal turbine can generate
as  much  energy  as  a  60-meter  (197  feet)  diameter  wind  turbine.  Ideal  locations
for tidal turbine arrays are close to shore in water depths of 20–30 meters (65.5–
98.5 feet).

• Currents: Ocean currents are similar to tidal flows, but significantly larger. As an
example,  the  energy  contained  in  the  Gulf  Stream  current  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean
is  equivalent  to  approximately  30  times  the  energy  contained  in  all  the  rivers  on
Earth.
The  only  area  in  the  United  States  where  ocean  currents  come  close  enough  to
land  to  make  potential  power  extraction  attractive  at  this  time  is  in  South  Flor-
ida,  where  the  Gulf  Stream  swings  in  close  to  shore.  It  is  envisioned  that  under-
sea turbines, similar to those being developed to harness tidal flows, might be de-
ployed to tap into this massive current.

• Ocean  Thermal  Energy  Conversion  (OTEC):  Thermal  gradients  are  the  only  ma-
rine renewable energy resource addressed in this bill that is not based on moving
water.  Instead,  thermal  technologies  use  the  difference  in  temperature  between
deep  and  shallow  waters  to  run  a  heat  engine.  This  temperature  difference  con-
tains  a  vast  amount  of  solar  energy.  If  extraction  could  be  done  profitably,  the
resource is virtually limitless.
OTEC works best when the temperature difference between the warmer, top layer
of the ocean and the colder, deep ocean water is about 20°C (36°F), conditions that
exist  in  tropical  coastal  areas.  To  bring  the  cold  water  to  the  surface,  OTEC
plants  require  a  large  diameter  intake  pipe,  which  is  submerged  a  mile  or  more
into the ocean’s depths. Heat is extracted from warm surface water.

Applications of Marine Renewable Energy
• Electric power production: The primary application of marine energy technologies
is  electrical  power  production.  Most  planned  installations  would  consist  of  arrays
of  multiple,  small  generating  devices,  optimally  positioned  to  take  advantage  of
a  particular  resource  (e.g.,  waves,  tidal  flows,  etc.).  The  multiple  devices  would
feed  their  power  into  a  centralized  hub  located  on  the  sea  floor,  which,  in  turn,
would  be  connected  to  a  substation  on  the  beach,  and  from  there  to  the  power
grid.

• Desalination:  One  virtue  of  locating  a  clean,  renewable  energy  producing  device
in  seawater  is  that  it  is  optimally  positioned  to  use  that  energy  for  desalination.
In  areas  where  fresh  drinking  water  is  at  a  premium,  marine  renewables  can
make an important contribution to solving that problem.

• Air  conditioning:  Air  conditioning  is  a  possible  byproduct  of  some  marine  energy
technologies.  For  example,  spent  cold  seawater  from  a  thermal  conversion  plant
can  chill  fresh  water  in  a  heat  exchanger  or  flow  directly  into  a  cooling  system
on  shore.  Simple  systems  of  this  type  have  air  conditioned  buildings  at  the  Nat-
ural Energy Laboratory in Hawaii for several years.

Benefits of Marine Renewable Energy
• Predictability:  Unlike  some  renewable  energy  sources,  notably  wind,  marine  re-
newable  energy  production  can  be  forecast  to  a  high  degree  of  certainty  well  in
advance. Using satellite observations, wave power can be forecast up to three days
in  advance.  Tides  can  be  forecast  years  in  advance.  Ocean  thermal  is  capable  of
providing a constant, base-load supply of power. This predictability makes it easi-
er to integrate marine renewables into a diverse generation portfolio.

• No  fuel  costs:  Marine  renewables  benefit  from  a  free  and  inexhaustible  source  of
‘‘fuel,’’  freeing  operators  and  consumers  from  concerns  about  future  fuel  avail-
ability and price volatility.

• Pollution  prevention:  Like  other  renewable  energy  technologies,  marine  renew-
ables  are  attractive  because  they  emit  no  pollutants  or  greenhouse  gases  in  the
process  of  producing  energy.  Devices  are  also  designed  to  prevent  any  pollution
to the ocean waters.

• Jobs and security: Marine renewable energy technologies can be produced domes-
tically,  thereby  providing  jobs  for  Americans  and  helping  to  reduce  security  con-
cerns associated with depending on foreign countries for oil and natural gas. The
large size of the resource, both in the United States and overseas, creates signifi-
cant market opportunities for marine renewable energy technology companies.

• Aesthetically  unobjectionable:  Often  opposition  to  energy  development  projects,
whether  onshore  or  off,  is  motivated  by  complaints  that  they  obstruct  or  detract
from  otherwise  beautiful  land-  or  sea-scapes.  In  contrast  to  most  other  tech-
nologies, many marine renewable energy technologies are submerged out of sight.
Other  marine  renewables  have  such  a  low  profile  and/or  are  located  so  far  from
shore that they generate no significant opposition on aesthetic grounds.

Cost

Cost estimates are difficult for wave and tidal, which, in contrast to offshore wind,
lack  operational  history.  For  wave,  costs  have  been  estimated  as  between  nine  and
16  cents/kWh,  far  more  favorable  than  the  40  cents/kWh  that  offshore  wind  cost
‘‘out of the box.’’ For in-stream tidal, the Electric Power Research Institute has pre-
dicted costs from four to 12 cents/kWh, depending on the rate of water flow. Because
of  tidal  power’s  similarities  to  wind,  it  may  benefit  from  the  advancements  already
made  in  wind  turbine  development  and  may  potentially  share  economies  of  scale
with that industry.

Issues
• Environmental  Impact:  The  greatest  concern  with  marine  renewables  is  the  im-
pact of power generation technologies on the marine environment and ecosystems.
Significant  research  remains  to  be  done  in  this  area  to  ensure  that  these  devices
do  not  have  significant  negative  environmental  impacts.  Turbine  technologies,  to
harness  tides  and  ocean  currents,  have  raised  particular  questions.  There  are
open  questions  about  the  impact  of  tidal  turbines  on  local  fisheries  and  marine
mammals.  This  is  an  area  requiring  in-depth  study.  It  is  important  that  studies
look  not  just  at  the  impact  of  individual  turbines,  but  also  the  impacts  of  large
arrays  of  multiple  turbines  in  a  give  location,  as  such  arrays  are  what  would  be
necessary to generate power on a utility scale.
For  marine  renewable  technologies  that  engage  in  desalination,  steps  must  be
taken to ensure that the concentrated brine produced as a byproduct of these op-
erations does not have a negative impact on local marine ecosystems.
Finally,  there  are  open  questions  relating  to  potential  environmental  impacts  of
extracting too much energy from tidal flows or ocean currents. In the case of tidal
flows,  care  must  be  taken  not  to  reduce  the  flow  by  too  much  to  avoid  harm  to
marine  ecosystems.  In  the  case  of  the  Gulf  Stream,  the  same  ecological  concerns
apply, and in addition, since the thermal energy carried by the Gulf Stream plays
an  important  role  in  regulating  the  climate  in  Europe,  it  is  important  to  under-
stand  whether  extracting  energy  from  this  system  might  have  negative  impacts
on weather systems that depend on its steady flow. While this possibility may be
remote, it is a question that warrants further study.

• Marine navigation: Since many marine renewable energy conversion devices float
on  the  water,  or  rest  on  the  bottom  of  navigable  waterways,  they  raise  concerns
about  possible  interference  with  marine  navigation.  It  is  important  that  devices

10

be  well-marked,  easily  visible  by  day  and  night,  and  appear  on  all  current  nau-
tical charts. Efforts should be made to make devices visible to radar as well.

• Survivability:  Marine  renewable  energy  devices  spend  their  entire  life  cycle  im-
mersed  in  corrosive  seawater  and  exposed  to  severe  weather  and  sea  conditions.
Steps  must  be  taken  to  ensure  the  survivability,  and  reliability,  of  these  devices
in these harsh conditions to ensure the uninterrupted supply of power.

Marine Renewable Energy Programs at DOE

The United States became involved in marine renewable energy research in 1974
with the establishment of the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority. The
Laboratory  became  one  of  the  world’s  leading  test  facilities  for  Ocean  Thermal  En-
ergy  Conversion  technology,  but  work  there  was  discontinued  in  2000.  Existing
OTEC  systems  have  an  overall  efficiency  of  only  one  percent  to  three  percent,  but
there  is  reason  to  believe  that  subsequent  technology  advances  and  changes  in  the
overall  electric  power  environment  may  make  a  fresh  look  at  OTEC  technologies
worthwhile.

In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Section 931(a)(2)(E) included a broad authoriza-
tion for research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs
for  ‘‘(i)  ocean  energy,  including  wave  energy.’’  However,  that  authorization  contains
no  further  instructions  on  how  to  structure  such  a  program  and  the  authorization
expires  after  FY  2009.  Despite  this  authorization,  DOE  has  not  made  a  budget  re-
quest  to  support  marine  energy  programs  since  EPACT  ’05  was  passed,  nor  have
funds been appropriated. This is despite the fact that FERC has begun to issue per-
mits  to  companies  and  investors  interested  in  developing  in-stream  tidal  sites,  and
several  private  companies—in  Europe,  Australia,  and  the  United  States—have
begun to test prototype marine renewable energy technologies of various design.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Good  morning,  ladies  and  gentlemen.  This
hearing will come to order, and I want to welcome everyone to our
hearing today on geothermal and ocean power technologies. We will
be  examining  two  bills:  H.R.  2304,  the  Advanced  Geothermal  En-
ergy  Research  and  Development  Act  of  2007, introduced  by  our  col-
league  from  California,  Representative  McNerney,  and  H.R.  2313,
the  Marine  Renewable  Energy  Research  and  Development  Act  of
2007, introduced by Representative Hooley of Oregon.

Things  are  quite  busy  this  morning  and  I  want  to  interrupt  my
comments  for  just  a  second.  We  are  probably  going  to  be  inter-
rupted  with  votes  at  around  10:30.  We  are  going  to  do  all  that  we
can as quickly as we can and then come back and complete our ef-
fort.

Each  of  these  bills  is  designed  to  accelerate  the  development  of
a  specific  renewable  energy  resource  that  has  great  potential  as  a
source of clean power generation, is vast in size, and three, is cur-
rently  receiving  little  support  for  research  and  development.  In
other words, these bills are about addressing overlooked opportuni-
ties  in  our  collective  efforts  to  create  good  American  jobs,  diversify
our  energy  supply,  increase  our  security  and  reduce  the  environ-
mental impact of energy production.

At this time I want to yield to Mr. McNerney, the author of H.R.

2304, to make a brief opening statement.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Lampson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

Good  morning  everyone  and  welcome  to  our  hearing  today  on  geothermal  and

ocean power technologies. We will be examining two bills:

H.R.  2304,  the  Advanced  Geothermal  Energy  Research  and  Development  Act  of
2007,  introduced  by  our  colleague  from  California,  Rep.  McNerney,  and  H.R.  2313,
the Marine Renewable Energy Research and Development Act of 2007, introduced by
Rep. Hooley of Oregon.

Each  of  these  bills  is  designed  to  accelerate  the  development  of  a  specific  renew-
able energy resource that: has great potential as a source of clean power generation,
is vast in size, and is currently receiving little R&D attention or support.

In  other  words,  these  bills  are  about  addressing  overlooked  opportunities  in  our
collective efforts to create good American jobs, diversify our energy supply, increase
our security, and reduce the environmental impact of energy production.

For decades, the United States has tapped geothermal energy for heating applica-
tions  and  to  produce  clean  electric  power.  We  know  this  resource  works.  But  most
geothermal  development  has  occurred  in  locations  where  underground  reservoirs  of
very  hot  water  or  steam—so  called  hydrothermal  systems—have  been  shallow  and
easily identifiable from the surface. Unfortunately, since obvious surface manifesta-
tions  of  geothermal  energy  do  not  occur  in  very  many  places,  geothermal  is  often
thought of as a marginal resource—not one that can play a major role in our power
generation portfolio across the Nation.

This view is inaccurate. In actuality, the obvious locations barely scratch the sur-
face  of  the  total  geothermal  potential  underneath  the  United  States.  By  investing
in  advanced  technologies  for  exploration  and  development,  we  can  learn  how  to
identify  hidden  resources  that  have  no  surface  manifestations,  and  even  learn  to
create new resources in hot rock where no natural reservoir or fluid exists. In doing
so,  we  have  the  potential  to  dramatically  expand  our  geothermal  energy  reserves.
In  addition  to  being  clean,  domestic,  and  renewable,  geothermal  energy  flows  in
an  uninterrupted  stream,  making  it  great  for  baseload  power  production.  And  the
amount  of  energy  stored  in  the  Earth’s  crust  is  enormous.  A  recent  report  by  an
MIT-led  panel  of  experts  estimated  that,  with  a  comparatively  modest  investment
in technology development, as much as 200,000 ‘‘quads’’ of geothermal energy could
become  commercially  accessible—an  amount  equal  to  2,000  times  the  total  energy
consumed in the U.S. each year.

Marine  renewable  energy  technologies  are  designed  to  harness  the  power  con-
tained  in  ocean  waves,  flowing  tides,  ocean  currents,  and  ocean  thermal  gradients.

The theoretical potential of these resources has been debated for years, but now ma-
rine  renewables  appear  poised  on  the  verge  of  a  breakthrough.  Countries  such  as
Australia,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  Portugal  are  investing  heavily  in  technologies
to  tap  the  ocean’s  energy  potential  and  will  soon  hook  the  first  commercial  projects
into their power grids.

In  2005,  the  Electric  Power  Research  Institute  completed  a  series  of  preliminary
studies to quantify the wave and tidal resources in U.S. coastal waters. They found
that  the  size  of  just  one  of  these  resources—waves—is  big  enough  to  provide  as
much  electric  power  as  all  of  the  hydroelectric  dams  currently  operating  in  the
United States—almost seven percent of our nation’s electricity in 2005. When other
marine  energy  resources  are  added  to  the  mix,  the  potential  becomes  truly  signifi-
cant.

The  title  of  this  hearing  says  it  all:  Developing  Untapped  Potential.  We  owe  it  to
current and future generations to develop our ability to tap the vast potential of geo-
thermal  and  ocean  energy.  Doing  so  will  increase  our  security,  foster  competitive
new  American  industries,  and  ensure  that  energy  production  of  the  future  is  com-
patible  with  the  highest  standards  of  environmental  stewardship.  This  is  the  pur-
pose behind H.R. 2304 and H.R. 2313.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  I  would  like  to  thank  Chairman  Lampson  and
Ranking Member Inglis for holding this hearing on geothermal and
ocean  energy  technologies,  and  I  would  like  to  thank  Chairman
Gordon for his support of geothermal research.

I  have  spent  over  20  years  of  my  professional  career  developing
wind  energy  technology  and  there  are  some  very  interesting  par-
allels.  We  saw  the  technology  developed  from  very  early  stage,
primitive  technology  to  what  we  see  today  as  a  very  successful,
cost-effective  technology  in  the  wind  industry  that  is  now  the  fast-
est growing form of new energy technology. Much American money
was spent and invested in this technology. Research was done here
in  the  United  States,  especially  in  California,  my  home  State.  But
what  happened  ultimately  is  the  United  States  Government  was
very inconsistent in its support for the development and implemen-
tation  of  wind  energy  technology.  Consequently,  what  happened  is
that the technology went overseas. It is now being produced in Eu-
rope  and  Japan,  even  though  all  the  research  dollars  were  spent
here by American industry and by American government. The prof-
its are now going to Europe and Japan.

So I see now a very similar situation happening with geothermal.
Geothermal  is  in  a  state  now  where  we  can  move  forward  and  be-
come  a  world  leader.  We  can  develop  the  technology.  We  can  have
the  technology  for  use  at  home  and  for  sale  overseas  but  incon-
sistent  or  nonexistent  government  support  or  policies  will  drive
that  industry  and  that  business  overseas,  so  it  behooves  us  to  de-
velop this new technology. Geothermal has a vast potential. The re-
ports  that  Dr.  Tester  and  others  have  produced  show  that  it  can
produce  10  percent  or  more  of  our  electrical  needs  by  2050.  So  we
need  to  embark  on  a  path  that  helps  us  develop  this  technology
and keep it at home and be the world leaders in this new emerging
technology that has such tremendous potential.

So with that, I will yield back to Mr. Lampson, to the Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much, Mr. McNerney.
At this time I would like to recognize the distinguished Ranking
Member  from  South  Carolina,  Mr.  Inglis,  for  his  opening  state-
ment.

Mr. INGLIS. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing

these bills and they do highlight the renewable energy sources that
can help America achieve energy security.

The  solution  to  our  energy  problems  will  come  from  a  variety  of
sources,  no  doubt.  We  hope  that  they  are  clean,  renewable  and  af-
fordable.  Surely  geothermal  and  marine-related  energy  sources  fit
that description and I am looking forward to hearing from our wit-
nesses  today  about  the  research  that  will  make  these  alternatives
affordable in a commercial market.

So thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing and thank
you  to  our  colleagues,  Ms.  Hooley  and  Mr.  McNerney,  for  these
bills.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Thank you for holding this hearing, Mr. Chairman. I also appreciate Mrs. Hooley’s
and  Mr.  McNerney’s  work  to  introduce  these  bills  that  highlight  two  renewable  en-
ergy sources that can help America achieve energy security.

The solution to our energy problems will come from a variety of sources, and they
need  to  be  clean,  renewable,  and  affordable.  Since  geothermal  and  marine-related
energy  sources  fit  that  description,  I’m  looking  forward  to  hearing  from  our  wit-
nesses today about the research that will make these alternatives affordable in the
commercial market.

Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to discussing these two bills

before the Committee.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Inglis, Ranking Member.
I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  all  additional  opening  statements
submitted by the Subcommittee Members be included in the record.
Without objection, so ordered.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good  morning.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  holding  today’s  hearing  to  review

two renewable energy bills regarding geothermal and marine power technologies.

First, H.R. 2304 directs the Secretary of Energy to support research, development,
demonstration,  and  commercial  application  of  advanced  technologies  to  locate  and
characterize  geothermal  resources  and  produce  geothermal  energy.  Geothermal  en-
ergy  is  heat  from  the  Earth’s  core  that  is  trapped  in  the  Earth’s  crust.  In  under-
ground  fluid-filled  reservoirs,  hot  water  or  steam  can  be  used  either  to  generate
electricity  or  to  heat  buildings,  greenhouses,  or  aquaculture  operations.  The  U.S.
has  become  the  world’s  largest  producer  of  electric  power  from  geothermal  energy;
however,  according  to  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS),  a  significant  number  of
geothermal  resource  locations  remain  hidden  and  unconfirmed.  H.R.  2304  contains
provisions  to  support  research  and  development  (R&D)  of  advanced  technologies  to
assist  in  locating  these  hot  water  resources,  and  to  encourage  demonstration  of  ad-
vanced exploration technologies by the geothermal industry. Funding has gradually
declined  for  geothermal  energy  R&D,  with  only  $5  million  appropriated  for  2007.
Further,  the  Administration  requested  no  funding  for  the  geothermal  programs  at
the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  for  FY08  because  they  believe  that  geothermal
technologies are mature, although that claim is disputed by geothermal researchers
and  the  industry.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  distinguished  witness  panel
on this point.

Second,  H.R.  2313  directs  the  Secretary  of  Energy  to  support  research,  develop-
ment, demonstration, and commercial application of technologies to produce electric
power  from  renewable  marine  resources.  Marine  renewable  energy  refers  to  energy
that  can  be  extracted  from  ocean  water.  H.R.  2313  would  support  technology  re-
search  and  development  to  ensure  that  U.S.  companies  are  competitive  in  this
emerging  global  market,  and  that  emerging  technologies  are  developed  in  an  envi-
ronmentally conscious way. One of the concerns with utilizing marine renewable en-
ergy is the impact of power generation technologies on the marine environment and
ecosystems.  It  is  my  understanding  that  additional  research  needs  to  be  completed
in  this  area  to  ensure  that  these  devices  do  not  have  significant  negative  environ-
mental  impacts.  To  this  end,  I  would  like  to  know  if  there  are  additional  environ-

mental  concerns  associated  with  marine  renewable  energy  development  and  I  look
forward to hearing the witness panel address my questions.

With that, I again thank the Chairman for calling this hearing.
Chairman LAMPSON. At this I would like to introduce our distin-
guished  panel  of  witnesses  starting  with  Dr.  Jefferson  Tester,  who
is  the  H.P.  Meissner  Professor  of  Chemical  Engineering  at  Massa-
chusetts  Institute  of  Technology.  Dr.  Tester  is  an  internationally
recognized  expert  in  enhanced  geothermal  systems  and  he  served
as  chair  of  the  MIT-led  panel  that  produced  the  recent  report,  the
Future of Geothermal Energy.

Mr.  Paul  Thomsen  is  Public  Policy  Manager  for  ORMAT  Tech-
nologies Inc., a leading provider of geothermal exploration, develop-
ment  and  power  conversion  technologies.  Mr.  Thomsen  is  respon-
sible  for  ORMAT’s  federal,  State  and  local  legislative  programs,
and  he  is  testifying  today  on  behalf  of  both  ORMAT  and  the  Geo-
thermal  Energy  Association.  At  this  time  I  would  like  to  recognize
Congresswoman Hooley for introduction of Dr. von Jouanne.

Ms. HOOLEY. Welcome. Dr. Annette von Jouanne has been a Pro-
fessor  in  the  School  of  Electrical  Engineering  and  Computer

new  bill,  H.R.  2304,  that  deals  with  geothermal  energy  research
and development. Along with my testimony, I have included a hard
copy  of  the  executive  summary  of  our  recently  completed  assess-
ment that you referred to. As you know, I was honored to serve as
the Chair of the panel that conducted that assessment.

First,  I  am  very  pleased  to  see  that  the  enormous  potential  of
geothermal energy is receiving the attention it deserves. This com-
mittee’s  attention  to,  and  leadership  on,  these  issues  is  important
to  the  country.  As  a  very  large,  well-distributed,  and  clean  indige-
nous  energy  resource,  geothermal’s  widespread  deployment  would
have a positive impact on our national energy security, on our envi-
ronment  and  on  our  economic  health.  Regrettably,  in  recent  years
geothermal  has  been  undervalued  by  many  and  was  often  ignored
as  a  portfolio  option  for  widespread  development  in  the  country.  If
this bill is enacted and supported with a multi-year commitment at
the levels recommended, it will completely reactivate an important
national-scale  effort  that  will  pay  substantial  dividends.  Investing
now  in  geothermal  R&D  coupled  to  a  program  of  field  demonstra-
tions  will  have  far-reaching  effects  towards  ensuring  a  sustainable
energy future for the U.S. for the long-term.

Enactment of this bill will put us on a path to utilize our massive
geothermal  resource  to  provide  dispatchable,  baseload  generating
capacity, essentially with no emissions of carbon dioxide, and using
modular plants that have small environmental footprints. These at-
tributes make geothermal an excellent option for the United States,
complementing  interruptible  renewables  such  as  solar  and  wind
and thus increasing the robustness of the national portfolio.

Although  conventional,  high-grade  hydrothermal  resources  are
already  being  used  effectively  in  the  United  States,  and  will  con-
tinue to be developed, they are somewhat limited by their locations
and ultimate potential. Beyond these conventional systems are En-
hanced,  or  Engineered,  Geothermal  Systems  (EGS)  resources  with
enormous  potential  for  primary  energy  recovery  using  heat-mining
technology.  EGS  feasibility  today  is  a  result  of  improvements  in
reservoir characterization and stimulation technologies and in deep
directional  drilling  that  have  evolved  in  the  past  three  decades.  It
is  the  EGS  approach  that  puts  geothermal  on  the  map  as  a  poten-
tially more sizable energy resource for the United States.

In  the  past  few  weeks  I  was  fortunate  to  be  able  to  visit  several
geothermal plants in the American West and in Iceland to observe
the  positive  impacts  that  geothermal  technology  is  having  first-
hand.  For  example,  ORMAT’s  new  plant  in  Reno,  Nevada,  com-
pletely reinjects all produced geothermal fluids, produces no carbon
dioxide  or  other  emissions,  and  uses  no  cooling  water  in  a  region
where water is a limited commodity. In Iceland, geothermal has en-
abled  an  economic  and  environmental  transformation  of  the  coun-
try  in  less  than  60  years.  Iceland’s  extensive  geothermal  network,
developed by Reykjavik Energy and other companies, now provides
100 percent of Iceland’s heating needs and 25 percent of their elec-
tric  power  with  hydro  providing  the  remainder.  Iceland’s  example
of  geothermal  utilization  is  a  model  that  the  United  States  should
strive  to  emulate.  Obviously  Iceland  is  a  special  place  geologically
and  only  some  regions  of  the  United  States  share  those  features.

However,  the  development  of  EGS  technology  puts  geothermal
within reach for a much larger portion of the United States.

Even though the United States is currently the largest worldwide
producer of electricity from geothermal energy, the total capacity is
barely 3,000 megawatts, much smaller than our total overall gener-
ating  capacity.  Fortunately,  the  actual  potential  for  geothermal  is
much  larger.  As  you  pointed  out,  our  analysis  suggests  that  a  fo-
cused  national  program  could  enable  geothermal  capacity  to  reach
100,000  megawatts  in  50  years,  comparable  to  the  current  gener-
ating  capacity  of  our  nuclear  and  hydropower  plants.  In  order  to
achieve  such  levels,  a  natural  transition  from  the  country’s  high-
grade  hydrothermal  systems  in  use  today  in  the  West  to  the  mas-
sive  EGS  resources  available  over  a  range  of  grades  across  the
country would need to occur in increasing amounts in the next ten
to  15  years.  The  fact  that  this  bill  addresses  both  short-  and  long-
term  research,  development,  demonstration  and  deployment  issues
and  needs  across  this  continuum  of  geothermal  grades  is  particu-
larly noteworthy, and from my perspective, essential to the success
of the national program.

I have included a few additional comments on some details of the
bill  in  my  written  testimony.  Thank  you  again  for  giving  me  the
opportunity to support this landmark legislation and thank you for
your leadership on this issue.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEFFERSON TESTER

The Future of Geothermal Energy

Overview:

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  grateful  for  the  opportunity
to  speak  with  you  this  morning  on  the  new  bill  H.R.  2304  covering  the  ‘‘Advanced
Geothermal  Energy  Research  and  Development  Act  of  2007,’’  which  was  introduced
in the House of Representatives on May 14 to direct the Secretary of Energy to con-
duct  a  national  program  for  geothermal  energy.  Along  with  my  testimony,  I  have
included  a  hard  copy  of  the  Executive  Summary  of  our  recently  completed  national
assessment—‘‘The  Future  of  Geothermal  Energy.’’  I  was  honored  to  be  the  Chair  of
an  expert  interdisciplinary  group  that  conducted  that  assessment  which  was  re-
leased in January.

First, I am very pleased to see that the enormous potential of geothermal energy
is  receiving  the  attention  it  deserves.  This  committee’s  attention  to  and  leadership
on  these  issues  is  important  to  the  country.  As  a  very  large,  well-distributed,  and
clean, indigenous energy resource, geothermal’s widespread deployment would have
a very positive impact on our national energy security, on our environment, and on
our  economic  health.  Regrettably,  in  recent  years  geothermal  energy  has  been  un-
dervalued  by  many  and  was  often  ignored  as  a  portfolio  option  for  widespread  de-
ployment in the U.S. If this bill is enacted and supported with a multi-year commit-
ment  at  the  levels  recommended,  it  will  completely  reactivate  an  important  na-
tional-scale  effort  that  will  pay  substantial  dividends.  Investing  now  in  geothermal
research  and  technology  development  coupled  to  a  program  of  field  demonstrations
will  have  far  reaching  effects  towards  insuring  a  sustainable  energy  future  for  the
U.S. for the long-term.

Enactment  of  this  bill  will  restore  U.S.  leadership  internationally.  It  will  put  us
on  a  path  to  utilize  our  massive  geothermal  resource  to  provide  dispatchable,  base-
load  capacity  generating  capacity  essentially  with  no  emissions  of  carbon  dioxide
and  using  modular  plants  that  have  small  environmental  ‘‘footprints.’’  These  at-
tributes  make  geothermal  a  very  attractive  renewable  deployment  option  for  the
U.S.—complementing interruptible renewables such as solar and wind, and thus in-
creasing the robustness of a national renewable portfolio.

Let  me  briefly  describe  to  the  committee  what  geothermal  energy  is.  Geothermal
resources  are  usually  described  in  terms  of  stored  thermal  energy  content  of  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:09 Feb 01, 2008 Jkt 035236 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051707\35236 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

17

rock  and  contained  fluids  underlying  land  masses  that  are  accessible  by  drilling.
The United States Geological Survey and other groups have used a maximum acces-
sible  depth  of  10  km  (approx.  30,000  ft.)  to  define  the  U.S.  resource.  Although  con-
ventional hydrothermal resources are already being used effectively for both electric
and  non-electric  applications  in  the  United  States,  and  will  continue  to  be  devel-
oped,  they  are  somewhat  limited  by  their  locations  and  ultimate  potential.  Beyond
these  conventional  hydrothermal  systems  are  Enhanced  Geothermal  Systems  or
EGS resources with enormous potential for primary energy recovery using heat-min-
ing  technology,  which  is  designed  to  extract  and  utilize  the  Earth’s  stored  thermal
energy. EGS feasibility is a result of improvements in reservoir characterization and
stimulation  technologies  and  in  deep,  directional  drilling  that  have  evolved  in  the
last  three  decades.  It  is  this  EGS  approach  that  puts  geothermal  on  the  map  as  a
potentially  much  more  sizable  energy  resource  for  the  U.S.  EGS  would  operate  as
a  closed  system  with  cool  water  pumped  deep  into  hot  fractured  rock  reservoirs
where it would be heated and then returned to the surface to be used as an energy
source to generate electricity or directly for heating applications Aside from conven-
tional  hydrothermal  and  EGS,  other  geothermal  resources  also  include  co-produced
hot  water  associated  with  oil  and  gas  production,  and  geo-pressured  resources  that
contain hot fluids with dissolved methane.

In the past few weeks I was fortunate to be able to visit several geothermal plants
in  the  American  West  and  in  Iceland  to  observe  the  positive  impacts  that  geo-
thermal  technology  is  having  firsthand.  For  example,  ORMAT’s  new  plant  in  Reno,
Nevada completely re-injects all produced geothermal fluids, produces no carbon di-
oxide or other emissions and uses no cooling water in a region where water is a lim-
ited commodity. In Iceland, geothermal has enabled an economic and environmental
transformation  of  the  country  in  less  than  60  years—from  Iceland’s  early  years  as
a  poor  society  that  was  completely  dependent  on  imported  fossil  fuels  in  the  1940s
to  an  economically  rich  society  in  2007  due  in  large  part  to  developing  a  more  sus-
tainable,  renewable  energy  supply.  Iceland’s  extensive  geothermal  network  devel-
oped  by  Reykjavik  Energy  and  other  companies  now  provides  100  percent  of  Ice-
land’s heating needs and 25 percent of their electric power with hydro providing the
remainder.  They  are  now  actively  pursuing  a  means  to  eliminate  their  dependence
on  imported  transportation  fuels  by  substituting  hydrogen  produced  by  electricity
generated from super-critical geothermal resources. Iceland’s example of geothermal
utilization  is  a  model  that  the  U.S.  should  strive  to  emulate.  Obviously,  Iceland  is
a special place geologically, and only some regions of the U.S. share those features.
However,  the  development  of  EGS  technology  puts  geothermal  within  reach  for  a
much larger portion of the U.S.

Even  though  the  U.S.  is  the  largest  worldwide  producer  of  electricity  from  geo-
thermal  resources  with  about  3000  MWe  of  capacity,  this  is  only  a  small  fraction
of our country’s generating capacity, which now exceeds 1,000,000 MWe or one TWe.
Fortunately,  the  actual  potential  for  geothermal  energy  in  the  U.S.  is  substantially
greater  than  3000  MWe  as  pointed  out  recently  by  the  MIT-led  assessment,  by  the
Western  Governors  Association  and  by  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory.
For  example,  our  analysis  suggests  that  with  a  focused  and  aggressive  national
RD&D  program,  we  could  enable  U.S.  geothermal  capacity  to  reach  100,000  MWe
in  50  years—comparable  to  the  current  generating  capacity  of  our  nuclear  and  hy-
dropower  plants.  In  order  to  achieve  such  levels  of  geothermal  capacity,  a  natural
transition  from  the  country’s  high  grade  hydrothermal  systems  in  use  today  to  the
massive  EGS  resource  over  a  range  of  grades  would  need  to  occur  in  increasing
amounts in the next 10 to 15 years.

The fact that this bill addresses both short- and long-term research, development,
demonstration,  and  deployment  issues  is  particularly  noteworthy.  Within  the  geo-
thermal  continuum  there  is  a  range  of  resource  types  and  grades  from  high-grade
conventional  hydrothermal  systems  that  are  currently  in  use  and  being  developed
in  the  West  to  lower-grade  Enhanced  (or  Engineered)  Geothermal  System  or  EGS
resources in the East. In order to enable geothermal technology to develop to a level
where  it  could  provide  10  percent  or  more  of  our  generating  capacity  by  2050  (that
is  >100,000  MWe),  it  is  essential  that  a  national  program  address  both  short  and
longer  term  technology  components  simultaneously  in  a  comprehensive  and  coordi-
nated manner. The bill is balanced and effectively structured to support critical pro-
gram elements for both hydrothermal and EGS.

The proposed national program is appropriately ambitious with a multi-year com-
mitment to support both field testing and laboratory work in conjunction with anal-
ysis,  characterization  technique  development,  and  modeling.  Overall,  two  critical
areas  would  be  emphasized—first,  to  enhance  the  quantitative  assessment  of  U.S.
geothermal resource on a site-specific basis and second, to demonstrate and validate
that  reservoir  stimulation  and  drilling  technologies  can  repeatedly  and  reliably  be

implemented  in  the  field  to  produce  commercial-scale  geothermal  systems.  Sound
geoscience  and  geoengineering  scientific  approaches  would  be  used  that  build  on
current  methods  for  extraction  of  oil  and  gas  and  conventional  hydrothermal  re-
sources  worldwide.  The  proposed  comprehensive  research,  development,  and  dem-
onstration  effort  will  lead  to  both  improved  and  new  technologies  capable  of  low-
ering  development  risks  and  costs  and  thereby  making  investments  in  geothermal
development more attractive for the private sector.

I have included a few additional comments on some details of the bill in my writ-
ten testimony. Thank you again for giving me the opportunity to support this impor-
tant landmark legislation, and thank you for your leadership on this issue.
Specific comments on the bill:

1. In  Sec.  3.  (1)  Regarding  the  definition  of  EGS—As  engineered  systems,  it
would  be  good  to  point  out  that  intervention  is  needed  to  address  one  or
more  of  the  following—1.  lack  of  sufficient  permeability  or  porosity  or  open
fracture  connectivity  within  the  reservoir,  2.  insufficient  contained  water
and/or  steam  in  the  reservoir,  and/or  3.  lower  average  geothermal  gradients
requiring deeper drilling.

2. In  Sec.  4(b,1)Resource  assessment—In  order  for  this  task  to  be  achieved  ef-
fectively  it  will  require  proactive  coordination  and  engagement  of  the  DOE
and  its  contractors  with  the  USGS,  MMS,  BLM  and  other  federal  agencies.
3. Secs. 4 and 5 Opportunities for direct heat use and co-generation of heat and
power—Given  the  large  improvement  in  energy  efficiency  that  occurs  in  di-
rect or combined heat and power utilization of geothermal, co-generation ap-
plications  for  residential  and  commercial  buildings  should  be  considered  for
demonstrations along with providing baseload electric power generation.

4. Sec. 7 impact on Secs. 6(b)(1) and (2) Co-funding requirements for EGS tech-
nology  development  and  early  EGS  field  demonstrations—A  20  percent  non-
federal  cost  sharing  for  EGS  technologies  development  and  a  50  percent  re-
quirement  for  field  demonstration  plants  are  likely  to  be  excessive  at  such
an  early  stage  of  the  reactivated  geothermal  program.  In  general,  it  may  be
difficult  for  universities  to  meet  these  cost  sharing  levels  and  some  may  in-
advertently be excluded from participating in the R&D program.

5. Importance  of  international  cooperation—Provisions  should  be  included  to
enable  vigorous  international  collaboration  on  EGS  and  hydrothermal  tech-
nology  where  appropriate  because  such  collaboration  leverages  U.S.-based
support  and  will  facilitate  the  incorporation  of  new  scientific  and  techno-
logical developments for geothermal utilization into the U.S. program.

6. Sec.  10.  (6)  Utilization  of  co-produced  fluids—Although  not  a  conventional
EGS  or  hydrothermal  resource,  co-produced  fluids  provide  a  short-term,  eco-
nomically  attractive  opportunity  for  utilizing  the  low  grade  thermal  energy
produced  during  the  production  of  oil  and  gas.  Provision  for  their  consider-
ation  should  indeed  be  part  of  a  national  effort,  but  they  seem  to  be  mis-
placed in Sec. 10. as they represent shorter-term opportunities.

8. Geothermal—In order to achieve the high impact goals of geothermal deploy-
ment,  it  will  be  necessary  to  increase  the  number  of  professionals  working
on geothermal technology in the U.S.

This  process  would  be  enhanced  by  connecting  the  national  RD&D  program  to
education in science and engineering at the college, university and professional lev-
els using internships, graduate fellowships, and similar instruments.

Summary of a national-scale assessment of EGS resources—‘‘The Future of
Geothermal Energy’’ (portions of a previous statement provided on
April 19, 2007 to Congress)

For  15  months  starting  in  September  of  2005,  a  comprehensive,  independent  as-
sessment  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  technical  and  economic  feasibility  of  EGS
becoming a major supplier of primary energy for U.S. base-load generation capacity
by 2050. The assessment was commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy and
carried  out  by  an  18-member,  international  panel  assembled  by  the  Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT). The remainder of my testimony provides a summary
of that assessment including the scope and motivation behind the study, as well as
its  major  findings  and  recommendations.  Supporting  documentation  is  provided  in

In  simple  terms,  any  geothermal  resource  can  be  viewed  as  a  continuum  in  sev-
eral  dimensions.  The  grade  of  a  specific  geothermal  resource  depends  on  its  tem-
perature-depth  relationship  (i.e.,  geothermal  gradient),  the  reservoir  rock’s  perme-
ability and porosity, and the amount of fluid saturation (in the form of liquid water
and/or  steam).  High-grade  hydrothermal  resources  have  high  average  thermal  gra-
dients,  high  rock  permeability  and  porosity,  sufficient  fluids  in  place,  and  an  ade-
quate  reservoir  recharge  of  fluids;  all  EGS  resources  lack  at  least  one  of  these.  For
example, reservoir rock may be hot enough but not produce sufficient fluid for viable
heat extraction, either because of low formation permeability/connectivity and insuf-
ficient reservoir volume, or the absence of naturally contained fluids.

A geothermal resource is usually described in terms of stored thermal energy con-
tent of the rock and contained fluids underlying land masses that are accessible by
drilling.  The  United  States  Geological  Survey  and  other  groups  have  used  a  max-
imum accessible depth of 10 km (approx. 30,000 ft.) to define the resource. Although
conventional hydrothermal resources are already being used effectively for both elec-
tric and non-electric applications in the United States, and will continue to be devel-
oped,  they  are  somewhat  limited  by  their  locations  and  ultimate  potential.  Beyond
these  conventional  resources  are  EGS  resources  with  enormous  potential  for  pri-
mary  energy  recovery  using  heat-mining  technology,  which  is  designed  to  extract
and utilize the Earth’s stored thermal energy. In addition to hydrothermal and EGS,
other  geothermal  resources  include  co-produced  hot  water  associated  with  oil  and
gas  production,  and  geo-pressured  resources  that  contain  hot  fluids  with  dissolved
methane. Because EGS resources have such a large potential for the long-term, the
panel focused its efforts on evaluating what it would take for EGS and other uncon-
ventional  geothermal  resources  to  provide  100,000  MWe  of  base-load  electric-gener-
ating capacity by 2050.

Three main components were considered in the analysis:

1. Resource—mapping  the  magnitude  and  distribution  of  the  U.S.  EGS  re-

source.

2. Technology—establishing  requirements  for  extracting  and  utilizing  energy
from  EGS  reservoirs,  including  drilling,  reservoir  design  and  stimulation,
and thermal energy conversion to electricity. Because EGS stimulation meth-
ods  have  been  tested  at  a  number  of  sites  around  the  world,  technology  ad-
vances, lessons learned and remaining needs were considered.

3. Economics—estimating  costs  for  EGS-supplied  electricity  on  a  national
scale using newly developed methods for mining heat from the Earth, as well
as  developing  levelized  energy  costs  and  supply  curves  as  a  function  of  in-
vested R&D and deployment levels in evolving U.S. energy markets.

Motivation: There  are  compelling  reasons  why  the  United  States  should  be  con-
cerned  about  the  security  of  our  energy  supply  for  the  long-term.  Key  reasons  in-
clude  growth  in  demand  as  a  result  of  an  increasing  U.S.  population,  the  increased
electrification  of  our  society,  and  concerns  about  the  environment.  According  to  the
Energy Information Administration (EIA, 2006), U.S. nameplate generating capacity
has increased more than 40 percent in the past 10 years and is now more than one
TWe. For the past two decades, most of the increase resulted from adding gas-fired,
combined-cycle  generation  plants.  In  the  next  15  to  25  years,  the  electricity  supply
system  is  threatened  with  losing  capacity  as  a  result  of  retirement  of  existing  nu-
clear and coal-fired generating plants (EIA, 2006). It is likely that 50 GWe or more
of  coal-fired  capacity  will  need  to  be  retired  in  the  next  15  to  25  years  because  of
environmental concerns. In addition, during that period, 40 GWe or more of nuclear
capacity  will  be  beyond  even  the  most  generous  re-licensing  accommodations  and
will have to be decommissioned.

The current nonrenewable options for replacing this anticipated loss of U.S. base-
load  generating  capacity  are  coal-fired  thermal,  nuclear,  and  combined-cycle  gas-
combustion  turbines.  While  these  are  clearly  practical  options,  there  are  some  con-
cerns.  First,  while  electricity  generated  using  natural  gas  is  cleaner  in  terms  of
emissions, demand and prices for natural gas will escalate substantially during the
next  25  years.  As  a  result,  large  increases  in  imported  gas  will  be  needed  to  meet
growing demand—further compromising U.S. energy security beyond just importing
the majority of our oil for meeting transportation needs. Second, local, regional, and
global environmental impacts associated with increased coal use will most likely re-
quire a transition to clean-coal power generation, possibly with sequestration of car-
bon  dioxide.  The  costs  and  uncertainties  associated  with  such  a  transition  are
daunting. Also, adopting this approach would accelerate our consumption of coal sig-

20

nificantly,  compromising  its  use  as  a  source  of  liquid  transportation  fuel  for  the
long-term. It is also uncertain whether the American public is ready to embrace in-
creasing nuclear power capacity, which would require siting and constructing many
new reactor systems.

On  the  renewable  side,  there  is  considerable  opportunity  for  capacity  expansion
of  U.S.  hydropower  potential  using  existing  dams  and  impoundments.  But  outside
of a few pumped storage projects, hydropower growth has been hampered by reduc-
tions in capacity imposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as
a  result  of  environmental  concerns.  Concentrating  Solar  Power  (CSP)  provides  an
option  for  increased  base-load  capacity  in  the  Southwest  where  demand  is  growing.
Although  renewable  solar  and  wind  energy  also  have  significant  potential  for  the
United  States  and  are  likely  to  be  deployed  in  increasing  amounts,  it  is  unlikely
that  they  alone  can  meet  the  entire  demand.  Furthermore,  solar  and  wind  energy
are  inherently  intermittent  and  cannot  provide  24-hour-a-day  baseload  without
mega-sized  energy  storage  systems,  which  traditionally  have  not  been  easy  to  site
and  are  costly  to  deploy.  Biomass  also  can  be  used  as  a  renewable  fuel  to  provide
electricity  using  existing  heat-to-power  technology,  but  its  value  to  the  United
States  as  a  feedstock  for  biofuels  for  transportation  is  much  higher,  given  the  cur-
rent goals of reducing U.S. demand for imported oil.

Clearly, we need to increase energy efficiency in all end-use sectors; but even ag-
gressive  efforts  cannot  eliminate  the  substantial  replacement  and  new  capacity  ad-
ditions  that  will  be  needed  to  avoid  severe  reductions  in  the  services  that  energy
provides to all Americans.

Pursuing the geothermal option: The main question we address in our assess-
ment  of  EGS  is  whether  U.S.-based  geothermal  energy  can  provide  a  viable  option
for providing large amounts of generating capacity when and where it is needed.

Although geothermal energy has provided commercial base-load electricity around
the  world  for  more  than  a  century,  it  is  often  ignored  in  national  projections  of
evolving U.S. energy supply. Perhaps geothermal has been ignored as a result of the
widespread  perception  that  the  total  geothermal  resource  is  only  associated  with
identified  high-grade,  hydrothermal  systems  that  are  too  few  and  too  limited  in
their  distribution  in  the  United  States  to  make  a  long  term,  major  impact  at  a  na-
tional level. This perception has led to undervaluing the long-term potential of geo-
thermal  energy  by  missing  a  major  opportunity  to  develop  technologies  for  sustain-
able heat mining from large volumes of accessible hot rock anywhere in the United
States.  In  fact,  many  attributes  of  geothermal  energy,  namely  its  widespread  dis-
tribution,  base-load  dispatchability  without  storage,  small  footprint,  and  low  emis-
sions,  are  very  desirable  for  reaching  a  sustainable  energy  future  for  the  United
States.

Expanding our energy supply portfolio to include more indigenous and renewable
resources  is  a  sound  approach  that  will  increase  energy  security  in  a  manner  that
parallels  the  diversification  ideals  that  have  made  America  strong.  Geothermal  en-
ergy  provides  a  robust,  long-lasting  option  with  attributes  that  would  complement
other important contributions from clean coal, nuclear, solar, wind, hydropower, and
biomass.

Approach: The composition of the panel was designed to provide in-depth exper-
tise  in  specific  technology  areas  relevant  to  EGS  development,  such  as  resource
characterization and assessment, drilling, reservoir stimulation, and economic anal-
ysis. Recognizing the possibility that some bias might emerge from a panel of knowl-
edgeable  experts  who,  to  varying  degrees,  are  advocates  for  geothermal  energy,
panel membership was expanded to include other experts on non-geothermal energy
technologies  and  economics,  and  environmental  systems.  Overall,  the  panel  took  a
completely  new  look  at  the  geothermal  potential  of  the  United  States.  This  study
was  partly  in  response  to  short-  and  long-term  needs  for  a  reliable  low-cost  electric
power and heat supply for the Nation. Equally important was a need to review and
evaluate  international  progress  in  the  development  of  EGS  and  related  extractive
technologies that followed the very active period of U.S. fieldwork conducted by Los
Alamos  National  Laboratory  during  the  1970s  and  1980s  at  the  Fenton  Hill  site  in
New Mexico.

The  assessment  team  was  assembled  in  August  2005  and  began  work  in  Sep-
tember,  following  a  series  of  discussions  and  workshops  sponsored  by  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy  (DOE)  to  map  out  future  pathways  for  developing  EGS  technology.
The final report was released in January of 2007.

The  first  phase  of  the  assessment  considered  our  geothermal  resource  in  detail.
Earlier  projections  from  studies  in  1975  and  1978  by  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey
(USGS  Circulars  726  and  790)  were  amplified  by  ongoing  research  and  analysis
being  conducted  by  U.S.  heat-flow  researchers  and  were  analyzed  by  David

Blackwell’s  group  at  Southern  Methodist  University  (SMU)  and  other  researchers.
In the second phase, EGS technology was evaluated in three distinct parts: drilling
to  gain  access  to  the  system,  reservoir  design  and  stimulation,  and  energy  conver-
sion  and  utilization.  Previous  and  current  field  experiences  in  the  United  States,
Europe,  Japan,  and  Australia  were  thoroughly  reviewed.  Finally,  the  general  eco-
nomic  picture  and  anticipated  costs  for  EGS  were  analyzed  in  the  context  of  pro-
jected demand for base-load electric power in the United States.

Findings:  Geothermal  energy  from  EGS  represents  a  large,  indigenous  resource
that can provide base-load electric power and heat at a level that can have a major
impact  in  the  United  States,  while  incurring  minimal  environmental  impacts.  With
a reasonable investment in R&D, EGS could provide 100 GWe or more of cost-com-
petitive  generating  capacity  in  the  next  50  years.  Further,  EGS  provides  a  secure
source of power for the long-term that would help protect America against economic
instabilities resulting from fuel price fluctuations or supply disruptions. Most of the
key  technical  requirements  to  make  EGS  economically  viable  over  a  wide  area  of
the  country  are  in  effect.  Remaining  goals  are  easily  within  reach  to  provide  per-
formance verification and demonstrate the repeatability of EGS technology at a com-
mercial scale within a 10- to 15-year period nationwide.

In spite of its enormous potential, the geothermal option for the United States has
been largely ignored. In the short-term, R&D funding levels and government policies
and  incentives  have  not  favored  growth  of  U.S.  geothermal  capacity  from  conven-
tional,  high-grade  hydrothermal  resources.  Because  of  limited  R&D  support  of  EGS
in the United States, field testing and support for applied geosciences and engineer-
ing research have been lacking for more than a decade. Because of this lack of sup-
port,  EGS  technology  development  and  demonstration  recently  has  advanced  only
outside  the  United  States,  with  limited  technology  transfer,  leading  to  the  percep-
tion that insurmountable technical problems or limitations exist for EGS. However,
in  our  detailed  review  of  international  field-testing  data  so  far,  the  panel  did  not
uncover  any  major  barriers  or  limitations  to  the  technology.  In  fact,  we  found  that
significant progress has been achieved in recent tests carried out at Soultz, France,
under  European  Union  (EU)  sponsorship;  and  in  Australia,  under  largely  private
sponsorship.  For  example,  at  Soultz,  a  connected  reservoir-well  system  with  an  ac-
tive volume of more than two km3 at depths from four to five km has been created
and tested at fluid production rates within a factor of two to three of initial commer-
cial goals. Such progress leads us to be optimistic about achieving commercial viabil-
ity  in  the  United  States  in  the  next  phase  of  testing,  if  a  national-scale  program
is supported properly. Specific findings include:
1. The amount of accessible geothermal energy that is stored in rock is im-
mense  and  well  distributed  across  the  U.S.  The  fraction  that  can  be  captured
and ultimately recovered will not be resource-limited; it will depend only on extend-
ing  existing  extractive  technologies  for  conventional  hydrothermal  systems  and  for
oil  and  gas  recovery.  The  U.S.  geothermal  resource  is  contained  in  a  continuum  of
grades  ranging  from  today’s  hydrothermal,  convective  systems  through  high-  and
mid-grade  EGS  resources  (located  primarily  in  the  western  United  States)  to  the
very  large,  conduction-dominated  contributions  in  the  deep  basement  and  sedi-
mentary  rock  formations  throughout  the  country.  By  evaluating  an  extensive  data-
base of bottom-hole temperature and regional geologic data (rock types, stress levels,
surface  temperatures,  etc.),  we  have  estimated  the  total  U.S.  EGS  resource  base  to
be about 14 million exajoules (EJ). Figure 1 and Table 1 highlight the results of the
resource  assessment  portion  of  the  study.  Figure  1  shows  an  average  geothermal
gradient  map  and  temperature  distributions  at  specific  depths  for  the  contiguous
U.S.  while  Table  1  lists  the  resource  bases  for  different  categories  of  geothermal.
Figure  2  compares  the  total  resource  to  what  we  estimate  might  be  technically  re-
coverable. Using conservative assumptions regarding how heat would be mined from
stimulated  EGS  reservoirs,  we  estimate  the  extractable  portion  to  exceed  200,000
EJ  or  about  2,000  times  the  annual  consumption  of  primary  energy  in  the  United
States in 2005. With technology improvements, the economically extractable amount
of useful energy could increase by a factor of 10 or more, thus making EGS sustain-
able for centuries.
2. Ongoing  work  on  both  hydrothermal  and  EGS  resource  development
complement  each  other.  Improvements  to  drilling  and  power  conversion  tech-
nologies, as well as better understanding of fractured rock structure and flow prop-
erties,  benefit  all  geothermal  energy  development  scenarios.  Geothermal  operators
now routinely view their projects as heat mining and plan for managed injection to
ensure  long  reservoir  life.  While  stimulating  geothermal  wells  in  hydrothermal  de-

22

velopments is now routine, understanding why some techniques work on some wells
and not on others can come only from careful research.
3. EGS  technology  advances.  EGS  technology  has  advanced  since  its  infancy  in
the 1970s at Fenton Hill. Field studies conducted worldwide for more than 30 years
have  shown  that  EGS  is  technically  feasible  in  terms  of  producing  net  thermal  en-
ergy by circulating water through stimulated regions of rock at depths ranging from
three  to  five  km.  We  can  now  stimulate  large  rock  volumes  (more  than  two  km3 ),
drill  into  these  stimulated  regions  to  establish  connected  reservoirs,  generate
connectivity  in  a  controlled  way  if  needed,  circulate  fluid  without  large  pressure
losses at near commercial rates, and generate power using the thermal energy pro-
duced  at  the  surface  from  the  created  EGS  system.  Initial  concerns  regarding  five
key  issues—flow  short  circuiting,  a  need  for  high  injection  pressures,  water  losses,
geochemical  impacts,  and  induced  seismicity—appear  to  be  either  fully  resolved  or
manageable with proper monitoring and operational changes.
4. Remaining  EGS  technology  needs.  At  this  point,  the  main  constraint  is  cre-
ating  sufficient  connectivity  within  the  injection  and  production  well  system  in  the
stimulated  region  of  the  EGS  reservoir  to  allow  for  high  per-well  production  rates
without reducing reservoir life by rapid cooling (see Figure 3). U.S. field demonstra-
tions  have  been  constrained  by  many  external  issues,  which  have  limited  further
stimulation and development efforts and circulation testing times—and, as a result,
risks and uncertainties have not been reduced to a point where private investments
would  completely  support  the  commercial  deployment  of  EGS  in  the  United  States.
In Europe and Australia, where government policy creates a more favorable climate,
the  situation  is  different  for  EGS.  There  are  now  seven  companies  in  Australia  ac-
tively pursuing EGS projects, and two commercial projects in Europe.
5. Impact  of  Research,  Development,  and  Demonstration  (RD&D).  Focus  on
critical  research  needs  could  greatly  enhance  the  overall  competitiveness  of  geo-
thermal  in  two  ways.  First,  such  research  would  lead  to  generally  lower  develop-
ment  costs  for  all  grade  systems,  which  would  increase  the  attractiveness  of  EGS
projects  for  private  investment.  Second,  research  could  substantially  lower  power
plant, drilling, and stimulation costs, thereby increasing accessibility to lower-grade
EGS  areas  at  depths  of  six  km  or  more.  In  a  manner  similar  to  the  technologies
developed for oil and gas and mineral extraction, the investments made in research
to develop extractive technology for EGS would follow a natural learning curve that
lowers  development  costs  and  increases  reserves  along  a  continuum  of  geothermal
resource grades.

Examples  of  benefits  that  would  result  from  research-driven  improvements  are

presented in three areas:

• Drilling  technology—Evolutionary  improvements  building  on  conventional
approaches to drilling such as more robust drill bits, innovative casing meth-
ods,  better  cementing  techniques  for  high  temperatures,  improved  sensors,
and electronics capable of operating at higher temperature in down-hole tools
will lower production costs. In addition, revolutionary improvements utilizing
new  methods  of  rock  penetration  will  also  lower  costs.  These  improvements
will enable access to deeper, hotter regions in high-grade formations or to eco-
nomically acceptable temperatures in lower-grade formations.

• Power  conversion  technology—Although  commercial  technologies  are  in
place  for  utilizing  geothermal  energy  in  70  countries,  further  improvements
to  heat-transfer  performance  for  lower-temperature  fluids,  and  to  developing
plant designs for higher resource temperatures in the super-critical water re-
gion  will  lead  to  measurable  gains.  For  example,  at  super-critical  tempera-
tures  about  an  order  of  magnitude  (or  more)  increase  in  both  reservoir  per-
formance  and  heat-to-power  conversion  efficiency  would  be  possible  over  to-
day’s liquid-dominated hydrothermal systems.

• Reservoir  technology—Increasing  production  flow  rates  by  targeting  spe-
cific  zones  for  stimulation  and  improving  down-hole  lift  systems  for  higher
temperatures,  and  increasing  swept  areas  and  volumes  to  improve  heat-re-
moval  efficiencies  in  fractured  rock  systems,  will  lead  to  immediate  cost  re-
ductions  by  increasing  output  per  well  and  extending  reservoir  lifetimes.  For
the  longer-term,  using  CO2 as  a  reservoir  heat-transfer  fluid  for  EGS  could
lead  to  improved  reservoir  performance  as  a  result  of  its  low  viscosity  and
high  density  at  super-critical  conditions.  In  addition,  using  CO2 in  EGS  may
provide  an  alternative  means  to  sequester  large  amounts  of  carbon  in  stable
formations.

6. EGS  systems  are  versatile,  inherently  modular,  and  scalable.  Individual
power  plants  ranging  from  one  to  50  MWe  in  capacity  are  possible  for  distributed
applications  and  can  be  combined—leading  to  large  ‘‘power  parks,’’  capable  of  pro-
viding  thousands  of  MWe  of  continuous,  base-load  capacity.  Of  course,  for  most  di-
rect-heating and heat pump applications, effective use of shallow geothermal energy
has  been  demonstrated  at  a  scale  of  a  few  kilowatts-thermal  (kWt)  for  individual
buildings  or  homes  and  should  be  continued  to  be  deployed  aggressively  when  pos-
sible.  For  these  particular  applications,  stimulating  deeper  reservoirs  using  EGS
technology is not necessary. Nonetheless, EGS also can be easily deployed in larger-
scale  district  heating  and  combined  heat  and  power  (co-generation)  applications  to
service both electric power and heating and cooling for buildings without a need for
storage  on-site.  For  other  renewable  options  such  as  wind,  hydropower,  and  solar
PV, such co-generation applications are not possible.
7. A  short-term  ‘‘win-win’’  opportunity.  Using  co-produced  hot  water,  available
in  large  quantities  at  temperatures  up  to  100°C  or  more  from  existing  oil  and  gas
operations,  makes  it  possible  to  generate  up  to  11,000  MWe  of  new  generating  ca-
pacity  with  standard  binary-cycle  technology,  and  to  increase  hydrocarbon  produc-
tion by partially offsetting parasitic losses consumed during production.
8. The  long-term  goal  for  EGS  is  tractable  and  affordable.  Estimated  supply
curves for EGS shown in Figure 4 indicate that a large increase in geothermal gen-
erating capacity is possible by 2050 if investments are made now. A cumulative ca-
pacity  of  more  than  100,000  MWe  from  EGS  can  be  achieved  in  the  United  States
within  50  years  with  a  modest,  multi-year  federal  investment  for  RD&D  in  several
field  projects  in  the  United  States.  Because  the  field-demonstration  program  in-
volves staged developments at different sites, committed support for an extended pe-
riod is needed to demonstrate the viability, robustness, and reproducibility of meth-
ods  for  stimulating  viable,  commercial-sized  EGS  reservoirs  at  several  locations.
Based  on  the  economic  analysis  we  conducted  as  part  of  our  study,  a  $300  million
to  $400  million  investment  over  15  years  will  be  needed  to  make  early-generation
EGS  power  plant  installations  competitive  in  evolving  U.S.  electricity  supply  mar-
kets.

These  funds  compensate  for  the  higher  capital  and  financing  costs  expected  for
early-generation EGS plants, which would be expected as a result of somewhat high-
er  field  development  (drilling  and  stimulation)  costs  per  unit  of  power  initially  pro-
duced.  Higher  generating  costs,  in  turn,  lead  to  higher  perceived  financial  risk  for
investors  with  corresponding  higher-debt  interest  rates  and  equity  rates  of  return.
In  effect,  the  federal  investment  can  be  viewed  as  equivalent  to  an  ‘‘absorbed  cost’’
of  deployment.  In  addition,  comparable  investments  in  R&D  will  also  be  needed  to
develop  technology  improvements  to  lower  costs  for  future  deployment  of  EGS
plants.

To a great extent, energy markets and government policies will influence the pri-
vate  sector’s  interest  in  developing  EGS  technology.  In  today’s  economic  climate,
there  is  reluctance  for  private  industry  to  invest  funds  without  strong  guarantees.
Thus, initially, it is likely that government will have to fully support EGS fieldwork
and  supporting  R&D.  Later,  as  field  sites  are  established  and  proven,  the  private
sector will assume a greater role in co-funding projects—especially with government
incentives accelerating the transition to independently financed EGS projects in the
private  sector.  Our  analysis  indicates  that,  after  a  few  EGS  plants  at  several  sites
are  built  and  operating,  the  technology  will  improve  to  a  point  where  development
costs and risks would diminish significantly, allowing the levelized cost of producing
EGS electricity in the United States to be at or below market prices.

Given these issues and growing concerns over long-term energy security, the Fed-
eral  Government  will  need  to  provide  funds  directly  or  introduce  other  incentives
in support of EGS as a long-term ‘‘public good,’’ similar to early federal investments
in large hydropower dam projects and nuclear power reactors.
9. Geothermal  energy  complements  other  renewables  such  as  wind,  solar
and biomass operating in their appropriate domains. Geothermal energy pro-
vides continuous base-load power with minimal visual and other environmental im-
pacts. Geothermal systems have a small footprint and virtually no emissions, includ-
ing  no  carbon  dioxide.  Geothermal  energy  has  significant  base-load  potential,  re-
quires no storage, and, thus, it complements other renewables—solar (CSP and PV),
wind,  hydropower—in  a  lower-carbon  energy  future.  In  the  shorter-term,  having  a
significant  portion  of  our  baseload  supplied  by  geothermal  sources  would  provide  a
buffer  against  the  instabilities  of  gas  price  fluctuations  and  supply  disruptions,  as
well as nuclear plant retirements. Estimates of the carbon emission reductions pos-
sible for different levels of EGS capacity are shown in Figure 5.

Recommendations  for  re-energizing  the  U.S.  geothermal  program:  Based  on
growing  markets  in  the  United  States  for  clean,  base-load  capacity,  the  panel  be-
lieves  that  with  a  combined  public/private  investment  of  about  $800  million  to  $1
billion  over  a  15-year  period,  EGS  technology  could  be  deployed  commercially  on  a
timescale that would produce more than 100,000 MWe or 100 GWe of new capacity
by  2050.  This  amount  is  approximately  equivalent  to  the  total  R&D  investment
made  in  the  past  30  years  to  EGS  internationally,  which  is  still  less  than  the  cost
of a single, new-generation, clean-coal power plant. Making such an investment now
is appropriate and prudent, given the enormous potential of EGS and the technical
progress  that  has  been  achieved  so  far  in  the  field.  Having  EGS  as  an  option  will
strengthen  America’s  energy  security  for  the  long-term  in  a  manner  that  com-
plements other renewables, clean fossil, and next-generation nuclear.

Because  prototype  commercial-scale  EGS  will  take  a  few  years  to  develop  and
field-test,  the  time  for  action  is  now.  Supporting  the  EGS  program  now  will  move
us  along  the  learning  curve  to  a  point  where  the  design  and  engineering  of  well-
connected EGS reservoir systems is technically reliable and reproducible.

We  believe  that  the  benefit-to-cost  ratio  is  more  than  sufficient  to  warrant  such
a modest investment in EGS technology. By enabling 100,000 MWe of new base-load
capacity,  the  payoff  for  EGS  is  large,  especially  in  light  of  how  much  would  have
to  be  spent  for  deployment  of  conventional  gas,  nuclear,  or  coal-fired  systems  to
meet  replacement  of  retiring  plants  and  capacity  increases,  as  there  are  no  other
options with sufficient scale on the horizon.

Specific recommendations include:

1. There should be a federal commitment to supporting EGS resource characteriza-
tion and assessment. An aggressive, sufficiently supported, multi-year national pro-
gram  with  USGS  and  DOE  is  needed  along  with  other  agency  participation  to  fur-
ther quantify and refine the EGS resource as extraction and conversion technologies
improve.
2. High-grade EGS resources should be developed first as targets of opportunity on
the  margins  of  existing  hydrothermal  systems  and  in  areas  with  sufficient  natural
recharge,  or  in  oil  fields  with  high-temperature  water  and  abundant  data,  followed
by  field  efforts  at  sites  with  above-average  temperature  gradients.  Representative
sites  in  high-grade  areas,  where  field  development  and  demonstration  costs  would
be  lower,  should  be  selected  initially  to  prove  that  EGS  technology  will  work  at  a
commercial scale. These near-term targets of opportunity include EGS sites that are
currently  under  consideration  at  Desert  Peak  (Nevada),  and  Coso  and  Clear  Lake
(both in California), as well as others that would demonstrate that reservoir-stimu-
lation methods can work in other geologic settings, such as the deep, high-tempera-
ture  sedimentary  basins  in  Louisiana,  Texas,  and  Oklahoma.  Such  efforts  would
provide  essential  reservoir  stimulation  and  operational  information  and  would  pro-
vide working ‘‘field laboratories’’ to train the next generation of scientists and engi-
neers who will be needed to develop and deploy EGS on a national scale.
3. In the first 15 years of the program, a number of sites in different regions of the
country  should  be  under  development.  Demonstration  of  the  repeatability  and  uni-
versality of EGS technologies in different geologic environments is needed to reduce
risk and uncertainties, resulting in lower development costs.
4. Like  all  new  energy-supply  technologies,  for  EGS  to  enter  and  compete  in  evolv-
ing  U.S.  electricity  markets,  positive  policies  at  the  state  and  federal  levels  will  be
required. These policies must be similar to those that oil and gas and other mineral-
extraction operations have received in the past—including provisions for accelerated
permitting  and  licensing,  loan  guarantees,  depletion  allowances,  intangible  drilling
write-offs,  and  accelerated  depreciations,  as  well  as  those  policies  associated  with
cleaner  and  renewable  energies  such  as  production  tax  credits,  renewable  credits
and  portfolio  standards,  etc.  The  success  of  this  approach  would  parallel  the  devel-
opment of the U.S. coal-bed methane industry.
5. Given  the  significant  leveraging  of  supporting  research  that  will  occur,  we  rec-
ommend  that  the  United  States  actively  participate  in  ongoing  international  field
projects  such  as  the  EU  project  at  Soultz,  France,  and  the  Cooper  Basin  project  in
Australia.
6. A  commitment  should  be  made  to  continue  to  update  economic  analyses  as  EGS
technology improves with field testing, and EGS should be included in the National
Energy Modeling System (NEMS) portfolio of evolving energy options.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Dr. Tester.
Mr. Thomsen.

STATEMENT OF MR. PAUL A. THOMSEN, PUBLIC POLICY

MANAGER, ORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Mr.  THOMSEN.  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  it  is
my  honor  to  testify  today  on  behalf  of  ORMAT  Technologies,  a
leading producer of geothermal energy around the world and in the
United States, and on behalf of the Geothermal Energy Association
(GEA).

ORMAT  and  the  GEA  applaud  Representative  McNerney  for  in-
troducing H.R. 2304, which directs the Secretary of Energy to con-
duct  a  program  of  research,  development,  and  demonstration  of
commercial  applications  to  expand  the  use  of  geothermal  energy
production.  This  legislation  is  crucial  in  directing  the  Department
of  Energy  to  implement  what  we  feel  was  the  legislative  intent  of
the  2005  Energy  Policy  Act  that  was  never  realized  due  to  the  im-
mediate  reduction  and  termination  of  the  geothermal  budget  only
months  after  the  2005  Energy  Policy  Act  was  enacted.  This  bill,  if
passed,  will  seed  the  basic  research,  provide  cost  sharing  and  dis-
seminate the information necessary to quickly and efficiently move
this country away from its dependence on foreign oil.

I submit to you all that this bill is necessary to push the Admin-
istration in the direction of funding the research necessary to fully
develop  this  country’s  homegrown,  green,  domestic  geothermal  en-
ergy  supply.  Geothermal  energy  currently  provides  this  country
with  2,800  megawatts  of  clean,  renewable,  domestic  energy  which
generates on average 16 billion kilowatt-hours of energy, or enough
power to light up two million homes. But I would like to point out,
however,  that  in  1979  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  estimated  a  hy-
drothermal  resource  base  in  this  country  between  95,000  and
105,000  megawatts.  In  2006,  the  Geothermal  Task  Force  of  the
Western  Governors  Association  identified  5,600  megawatts  of  geo-
thermal  power  that  could  be  developed  with  existing  incentives.
Today  the  GEA  believes  that  74  new  geothermal  energy  projects
are  under  some  form  of  development  in  the  United  States  and  can
provide an additional 2,500 megawatts of electrical power capacity.
As this new capacity comes online, it will represent an investment
of  roughly  $8  billion.  It  will  create  10,000  new  full-time  jobs  and
stimulate  over  40,000  person-years  of  construction  and  manufac-
turing employment across this country. However, if we add the ad-
ditional  2,500  megawatts  coming  online  to  our  current  production,
we  see  that  we  will  produce  approximately  5,300  megawatts  from
a  known  hydrothermal  resource  base  that  was  conservatively  esti-
mated  at  150,000  megawatts  in  1979.  I  ask  you,  is  that  the  best
we  can  do?  Is  3.5  percent  utilization  of  our  clean,  domestic,  base-
load  resource  acceptable  to  a  country  that  imports  10  million  bar-
rels of oil a day and is 60 percent dependent on net petroleum im-
ports?

H.R.  2304  recognizes  that  the  answer  is  ‘‘no.’’  The  time  to  take
action  is  now.  There  are  substantial  needs  for  improvements  in
technology,  resource  information  and  efficiency  for  which  federal
research is vital. Join me, please, in supporting H.R. 2304 and cap-
italizing  upon  one  of  our  greatest  national  assets,  human  inge-
nuity. H.R. 2304 will allow the men and women of our national lab-
oratories, universities, state energy offices and private enterprise to
develop  cutting-edge  geothermal  projects  and  technology  that  will
make use of this country’s vast untapped geothermal potential.

On  behalf  of  ORMAT,  I  want  to  applaud  this  committee  for  its
interest  in  a  secure  domestic  baseload  energy  supply  that  is  geo-
thermal energy. We humbly realize that the decisions made by this
committee impact our nation’s energy security.

This concludes my introductory comments and I will be happy to

respond to any questions this committee might have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAUL A. THOMSEN

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  it  is  my  honor  to  testify  today  on  be-
half of not only ORMAT Technologies, but also on behalf of the Geothermal Energy
Association  whose  testimony  has  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  entire  Board
of Directors and will be submitted along with my testimony into the record.

By way of introduction ORMAT Technologies, is a New York Stock Exchange reg-
istered company (symbol ‘‘ORA’’). ORMAT technologies develops, owns, and operates
geothermal  and  recovered  energy  facilities  throughout  the  world.  ORMAT  has  sup-
plied  900  MWs  of  geothermal  power  plants  in  21  countries.  Here  in  the  United
States  ORMAT  owns  and  operates  approximately  300  MWs  of  geothermal  power
plants  in  the  states  of  California,  Hawaii,  Nevada,  and  we  are  pleased  to  be  pro-

viding  U.S.  Geothermal  Company  with  the  technology  needed  to  bring  Idaho’s  first
geothermal power plant online.

We applaud Rep. McNerney for introducing H.R. 2304 which would direct the Sec-
retary of Energy to conduct a program of research, development, demonstration and
commercial  applications  for  geothermal  energy.  This  legislation  would  authorize  a
program that will help develop the science and technology needed to utilize the vast
untapped geothermal resources of our nation.

ORMAT  believes  a  vast  potential  exists  that  could  help  meet  the  country’s  grow-
ing electricity needs, spur economic growth and help reduce emissions of greenhouse
gases.  The  Geothermal  Task  Force  of  the  Western  Governors  Association’s  Clean
and  Diversified  Energy  Advisory  Group  identified  5,600  MW  of  geothermal  power
that could be developed with existing incentives, and another 13,000 MW that could
be  tapped  with  additional  time,  higher  prices,  or  both.  Of  course,  these  estimates
assume  today’s  level  of  technology,  which  is  a  major  variable  that  could  change
these results.

H.R. 2304 would authorize and direct DOE to undertake a research program that
would  develop  the  tools  and  technology  needed  to  find  and  successfully  develop  the
hydrothermal resource base. Without the support of the Federal Government as pro-
posed  in  H.R.  2304  it  is  our  view  that  most  of  the  hydrothermal  resource  base  will
not be developed under current conditions. H.R. 2304 would also direct the Depart-
ment  to  take  the  steps  towards  developing  full  scale  enhanced  geothermal  systems
(EGS)  technology.  From  ORMAT’s  experience  every  MW  of  clean,  baseload,  geo-
thermal  energy  we  bring  on  line  represents  a  three  million  capital  investment  by
our company.

H.R.  2304  also  would  establish  centers  of  geothermal  technology  transfer.  Infor-
mation is important to improve exploration, application of technology, and improved
performance  of  geothermal  development  and  production  efforts.  ORMAT  feels  that
the  proposal  to  establish  such  centers  would  be  an  important  aid  in  efforts  to  tap
our nation’s geothermal resources.

ORMAT recognizes that H.R. 2304 does list both co-production and geo-pressured
resources  as  items  to  be  addressed  by  the  Secretary  of  Energy  in  a  required  report
to Congress on advanced uses of geothermal energy. If additional provisions are not
included  in  the  bill,  we  would  hope  that  the  Department  would  take  this  oppor-
tunity  to  re-examine  its  views  of  these,  and  all  geothermal  technologies,  to  develop
programs  that  would  effectively  tap  this  enormous,  undeveloped  domestic  energy
supply.

ORMAT  believes  cost-sharing  is  an  appropriate  and  necessary  component  of  a
near-market partnership between the government and a for-profit entity. For an ex-
ample  of  what  can  come  from  this  type  of  collaboration  I  turn  to  the  fact  that
ORMAT  has  signed  a  cost-shared  Cooperative  Research  and  Development  Agree-
ment  (CRADA)  with  DOE  to  validate  the  feasibility  of  a  proven  technology  already
used in geothermal and Recovered Energy Generation (REG).

The  project  will  be  conducted  at  the  DOE  Rocky  Mountain  Oil  Test  Center
(RMOTC),  near  Casper,  Wyoming,  and  will  use  an  ORMAT  Organic  Rankine  Cycle
(ORC) power generation system to produce commercial electricity. ORMAT will sup-
ply  the  ORC  power  unit  at  its  own  expense  while  the  DOE  will  install  and  operate
the  facility  for  a  12-month  period.  ORMAT  and  the  DOE  will  share  the  total  cost
of the test and the study, with ORMAT bearing approximately two thirds of the less
than $1M total investment.

Presently  there  are  two  large  unutilized  sources  of  hot  water  at  the  RMOTC
Naval  Petroleum  Reserve  No.  3,  which  produces  water  in  excess  of  190  degrees
Fahrenheit  and  at  flow  rates  sufficient  for  generation  of  approximately  200  kW.
This  project  will  consist  of  the  installation,  testing  and  evaluation  of  a  binary  geo-
thermal  power  unit  in  the  field  near  these  hot  water  sources.  The  ORC  power  unit
will  be  interconnected  into  the  field  electrical  system  and  the  energy  produced  will
be used by RMOTC and monitored for reliability quality.

The  information  gathered  from  this  project  may  have  implications  to  the  some
8,000 similar type wells have been identified in Texas, by Professor Richard Erdlac
of the University of Texas of the Permian Basin, and the U.S. DOE Geothermal Re-
search  Project  Office.  Lyle  Johnson  senior  engineer  at  the  RMOTC  stated  ‘‘The  in-
troduction  of  geothermal  energy  production  in  the  oil  field  will  increase  the  life  of
the  fields  and  bridge  the  gap  from  fossil  energy  to  renewable  energy.’’  Why  are  we
zeroing out a research budget that provides such potential for this country.

ORMAT  believes  that  the  full  geothermal  potential  of  the  western  United  States
can be brought online in the near-term with the assistance of legislation as proposed
by Rep. McNerney.

On behalf of ORMAT, I want to applaud this committee for its interest in the se-
cure domestic baseload energy supply that is geothermal energy. We humbly realize

STATEMENT OF THE GEOTHERMAL ENERGY ASSOCIATION

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, we applaud the Subcommittee
for  holding  this  hearing  entitled  ‘‘Developing  Untapped  Potential:  Geothermal  and
Ocean Power Technologies.’’ We submit this statement on behalf of the Board of Di-
rectors of the Geothermal Energy Association.

While only a small fraction of the geothermal resource base is utilized today, geo-
thermal energy provides significant energy for our nation. The United States is the
world’s largest producer of geothermal electricity. The 2,800 MW existing power ca-
pacity generates an average of 16 billion kilowatt hours of energy per year.

According  to  a  GEA  survey  released  last  week,  seventy-four  new  geothermal  en-
ergy  projects  are  under  development  in  the  U.S.  that  will  provide  an  additional
2,900 megawatts of electric power capacity. This new capacity will represent an in-
vestment of roughly $6 billion, create 10,000 new full-time jobs, and stimulate over
40,000  person-years  of  construction  and  manufacturing  employment  across  the  Na-
tion.

While this new development is impressive, much more potential exists that could
help  meet  the  country’s  growing  electricity  needs,  spur  economic  growth,  and  help
reduce  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.  The  Geothermal  Task  Force  of  the  Western
Governors’  Association’s  Clean  and  Diversified  Energy  Advisory  Group  identified
5,600 MW of geothermal power that could be developed with existing incentives, and
another  13,000  MW  that  could  be  tapped  with  additional  time,  higher  prices,  or
both. Of course, these estimates assume today’s level of technology, which is a major
variable that could change these results.

Yet,  even  if  these  resources  were  developed,  they  would  represent  only  a  fraction
of  the  hydrothermal  resource  base.  The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS),  in  its  Cir-
cular  790,  estimates  a  hydrothermal  resource  base  of  between  95,000  and  150,000
MW,  of  which  25,000  are  known  resources.  Most  of  the  resources  identified  in  the
WGA study were known resources in 1979 when the USGS completed its report. In
1979  we  lacked  the  technology  to  find  and  characterize  most  of  the  hydrothermal
resource base, and unfortunately today we still lack that technical capability.

In  addition  to  significant  electric  power  generation,  direct  uses  of  geothermal  re-
sources by businesses, farms, and communities have substantial additional potential
for energy, economic, and environmental benefits. While geothermal resources have
been  used  in  communities  and  homes  for  decades—for  example  Boise,  Idaho  has
been using geothermal resources for space heating for over 100 years—the extensive
potential  for  direct  use  has  been  largely  ignored  and  underutilized.  Direct  use  re-
sources  span  the  entire  country—from  New  York  to  Hawaii—and  their  expanded
use could displace fossil fuels.

Beyond the conventional hydrothermal resources powering our existing generating
plants and providing process heat, new types of geothermal resources are emerging.
Recent estimates indicate a substantial potential for geothermal production from hot
water  co-produced  in  oil  and  gas  fields,  and  there  is  renewed  interest  in  geo-pres-
sured resources in Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf. These hold significant future en-
ergy  potential.  Finally,  development  of  the  techniques  for  engineering  geothermal
systems (EGS) holds the promise of expanding economic production from known geo-
thermal  systems  and  someday  allowing  production  from  EGS  power  systems  vir-
tually anywhere in the U.S.

The  benefits  of  expanding  new  geothermal  production  will  be  substantial.  Geo-
thermal power can be a major contributor to the power infrastructure and economic
well-being  of  the  United  States.  Geothermal  power  is  a  reliable,  24/7  baseload  en-
ergy source that typically operates 90 to 98 percent of the time. Insulated from fuel
market price volatility, geothermal power supports energy price stability and boosts
energy security because it is a domestic resource. Geothermal power can help diver-
sify the Nation’s energy supply and is a clean, renewable energy source.

The  surge  in  geothermal  development  portrayed  in  GEA’s  new  survey  has  been
stimulated  by  the  federal  production  tax  credit  (PTC),  which  was  first  extended  to
geothermal  power  facilities  in  2005.  The  PTC  provides  the  incentive  needed  to  en-
courage investment in new projects, and state renewable portfolio standards (RPSs)
ensure  that  there  is  a  market  for  geothermal  power.  In  the  near-term,  both  are  es-
sential to sustain the momentum we are witnessing in new project development, but
to develop the full potential of the resource advances in technology will be essential.
There are substantial needs for improvements in technology, resource information,
and  efficiencies  for  which  federal  research  is  vital.  The  range  of  near-term  needs  is
broad.  Our  knowledge  of  the  geothermal  resource  base  is  limited  and  largely  out-
dated.  The  technology  available  today  to  identify  and  characterize  the  resource  is
too unreliable to mitigate the high risk of development. Drilling in harsh geothermal
environments is difficult and expensive. In locations where the resource cannot pres-

ently  support  commercial  production,  we  need  to  be  able  to  apply  EGS  techniques
to achieve power generation at competitive prices.

The  geothermal  industry  supports  a  continued  geothermal  research  program  to
address  the  near-term  need  to  expand  domestic  energy  production  and  the  longer-
term  need  to  find  the  breakthroughs  in  technology  that  could  revolutionize  geo-
thermal  power  production.  This  includes  an  ongoing  R&D  program  focused  on  fur-
ther  expanding  the  hydrothermal  resource  base,  developing  the  technology  needed
to make the EGS concept commercially viable, and taking advantage of the substan-
tial deep thermal resources associated with the petroleum formations along the Gulf
Coast. These programs are critical if we are to maintain our national status in cut-
ting-edge geothermal technology, which is increasingly in jeopardy.

The  January  2006  report  of  the  WGA  Geothermal  Task  Force  Report  also  sup-
ports  the  need  for  federal  research  efforts.  The  Task  Force  Report  recommends:  ‘‘a
strong, continuing geothermal research effort at the Department of Energy that ad-
dresses the full range of technical problems encountered in achieving full production
from  the  identified  and  undiscovered  resources  in  the  West.’’  The  report  also  sup-
ports  ‘‘. . .continuation  of  advanced  technology  programs  and  outreach  through
GeoPowering  the  West.’’  In  addition,  the  report  urges  DOE  to  expand  its  program
in  critical  areas  ‘‘particularly  the  identification  and  development  of  new  resources’’
and  ‘‘support  for  exploration  and  exploratory  drilling.’’  Finally,  it  asks  the  Depart-
ment of Energy (DOE) to ‘‘examine whether existing federal loan guarantee author-
ity  in  law  can  be  used  to  supplement  these  activities  to  reduce  risk  and  encourage
development  of  new  resource  areas.’’  (http://www.westgov.org/wga/initiatives/
cdeac/geothermal.htm)

We applaud Rep. McNerney for introducing H.R. 2304 which would direct the Sec-
retary of Energy to conduct a program of research, development, demonstration and
commercial  applications  for  geothermal  energy.  This  legislation  would  authorize  a
program that will help develop the science and technology needed to utilize the vast
untapped geothermal resources of our nation.

One  of  the  best  overviews  of  that  potential  is  presented  in  the  National  Renew-
able  Energy  Laboratory’s  (NREL)  Technical  Report  published  in  November  2006,
Geothermal—The  Energy  Under  Our  Feet.  The  report  examines  what  it  terms  the
‘‘enormous  potential  of  geothermal  resources.’’  It  estimates  what  the  full  range  of
geothermal  energy  technologies  could  contribute  by  2015,  2025  and  2050.  (Geo-
thermal—The  Energy  Under  Our  Feet  is  available  at  http://www.nrel.gov/docs/
fy07osti/40665.pdf) The following chart shows NREL’s estimate of this potential:

The NREL report points to at least three areas where geothermal resources might
contribute 100,000 MW of more to domestic energy supplies: first, the hydrothermal
resource  base;  second,  oil  and  gas  co-production  and  geo-pressured  resources;  and,
third, development of ‘‘deep geothermal’’ (or EGS) production. H.R. 2304 defines spe-
cific research efforts to address at least two of these three energy opportunities.

H.R. 2304 would authorize and direct DOE to undertake a research program that
would  develop  the  tools  and  technology  needed  to  find  and  successfully  develop  the
hydrothermal resource base. While tax incentives and State support may be able to
double  or  triple  current  geothermal  production,  that  would  still  be  far  short  of  tap-
ping  the  Nation’s  hydrothermal  potential.  Developing  10,000  or  even  20,000  MW  of
geothermal energy would be only a fraction of the estimated hydrothermal resource.
But,  without  the  support  of  the  Federal  Government  as  proposed  in  H.R.  2304,  it
is our view that most of the hydrothermal resource base will not be developed under
current conditions.

H.R. 2304 would also direct the Department to take the steps towards developing
full scale EGS technology. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-led study
released  in  January  2007  found  ‘‘that  mining  the  huge  amounts  of  heat  that  reside
as  stored  thermal  energy  in  the  Earth’s  hard  rock  crust  could  supply  a  substantial
portion of the electricity the United States will need in the future, probably at com-
petitive  prices  and  with  minimal  environmental  impact.’’  (An  Executive  Summary
and  the  full  MIT  report,  The  Future  of  Geothermal  Energy,  are  available  at:  http:/
/www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/future¥geothermal.html).

We  understand  that  Professor  Jeff  Tester  of  MIT  will  testify  before  the  Sub-
committee, so we will defer a lengthy discussion of EGS technology and its potential.
However,  GEA  supports  development  of  EGS  technology  as  a  critical  element  of
DOE’s long-term research strategy.

H.R.  2304  also  would  establish  centers  of  geothermal  technology  transfer.  Access
to  information  can  help  improve  exploration,  application  of  technology,  and  im-
proved performance of geothermal development and production efforts. The proposal
to  establish  such  centers  would  be  an  important  aid  in  efforts  to  tap  our  nation’s
geothermal resources.

The  one  major  area  of  potential  identified  by  NREL  that  H.R.  2304  does  not  ad-
dress  with  specific  authorizing  direction  is  oil  and  gas  field  co-production  and  geo-
pressured  resources.  These  resources  hold  substantial  energy  potential,  but  serious
uncertainties that keep the market from moving forward must be addressed by fed-
eral efforts.

For  co-production,  there  are  uncertainties  about  the  resource  information  as  well
as the best fit for power technology. Until there is better and more detailed informa-
tion  about  the  resource  potential,  and  companies  have  experience  using  small  scale
power  technology  in  these  applications,  it  is  unlikely  that  there  will  be  rapid  com-
mercialization  of  geothermal  technology  in  oil  field  settings.  Near-term  cost-shared
demonstrations at several sites would be the best approach to resolving these issues
and  accelerating  development  of  the  energy  potential  from  co-production.  We  sug-
gest the Committee consider adding this directly to the legislation rather than wait-
ing for the report from the Secretary of Energy required by Section 10.

The  potential  of  geo-pressured  resources  is  impressive.  They  contain  enormous
quantities  of  hot  water  and  gas.  The  recoverable  gas  from  geo-pressured  reservoirs
has  been  estimated  to  be  several  hundred  years  supply  for  the  entire  Nation.  Geo-
pressured resources are to natural gas what oil shale resources are to liquid fuels—
a potentially enormous source of energy. Unfortunately, the one demonstration con-
ducted  by  DOE  twenty  years  ago  was  terminated  after  a  short  period  of  operation,
it  did  not  seek  to  optimize  for  gas  production,  and  it  was  based  upon  what  is  now
somewhat  dated  technology.  Today,  we  have  begun  to  import  greater  quantities  of
natural  gas,  and  projections  show  the  U.S.  becoming  much  more  dependent  upon
natural gas imports in the future.

Developing  the  technology  to  produce  gas  from  geo-pressured  geothermal  re-
sources  could  curtail  our  growing  dependence  on  imports,  but  the  cost  and  extreme
risk  of  geo-pressured  development  will  not  be  undertaken  by  industry  alone.  It  re-
quires  a  partnership  with  the  government.  Given  the  enormous  resource  potential,
such an effort is justified and in the national interest.

We recognize that H.R. 2304 lists both co-production and geo-pressured resources
as items to be addressed by the Secretary of Energy in a required report to Congress
on advanced uses of geothermal energy. If additional provisions are not included in
the bill, we hope the Department will take this opportunity to re-examine its views
of these, and all geothermal technologies, to develop programs that would effectively
tap this enormous, undeveloped domestic energy supply.

The  cost-sharing  requirements  of  H.R.  2304  raise  a  number  of  questions.  While
in  principle,  GEA  believes  cost-sharing  is  an  appropriate  and  necessary  component
of  a  near-market  partnership  between  the  government  and  a  for-profit  entity,  it’s
not  clear  that  the  provisions  of  the  legislation  recognize  appropriately  the  role  of
contractors  and  researchers  who  lack  the  resources  and  profit-potential  motivation
to enter into a significant cost-share. In addition, we suggest that the Subcommittee
consider making all cost-share requirements ranges rather than single proposed per-

36

centages  and  including  in  the  measure  some  of  the  basic  criteria  DOE  should  use
to  determine  when  a  cost  share  is  appropriate  and  at  what  percentage.  This  might
provide  better  results  while  maintaining  the  principle  which  we  believe  the  legisla-
tion seeks to affirm.

Finally,  we  encourage  the  Committee  to  examine  whether  the  update  of  the  na-
tional geothermal resource assessment being conducted by the U.S. Geologic Survey
will  be  adequate  and  complete.  This  will  be  the  first  assessment  in  over  25  years,
and it is critical to the future progress in geothermal energy production. Policy-mak-
ers at all levels need accurate and reliable information about the potential contribu-
tion  of  geothermal  resources.  To  be  adequate  and  complete,  the  USGS  assessment
should  examine  the  full  range  of  geothermal  resources  identified  in  the  NREL  Re-
port and include field verification as necessary.

We  have  attached  to  this  statement  a  letter  from  Leland  Roy  Mink,  the  former
Manager  of  the  DOE  Geothermal  Research  Program,  who  expresses  his  support  for
the legislation and the Subcommittee’s initiative.

We  thank  the  Subcommittee  for  considering  our  views,  and  encourage  all  Mem-
bers  of  the  Subcommittee  to  support  H.R.  2304.  This  legislation  is  urgently  needed
to ensure that federal energy programs work to tap the tremendous potential of our
nation’s geothermal energy resources.

Attachment
Honorable Congressman Lampson, Chairman
Subcommittee on Energy and Environment
Committee on Science and Technology
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515
Dear Mr. Chairman,

I  wish  to  express  strong  endorsement  for  draft  legislation  the  Subcommittee  is
considering  for  support  of  DOE  Geothermal  Research  and  Development.  This  legis-
lation is critical for continued development of the tremendous geothermal energy po-
tential  the  U.S.  possesses  and  the  leadership  role  the  U.S.  has  established  in  geo-
thermal technology.

I  am  writing  because  of  deep  concern  about  the  DOE  decision  to  terminate  the
geothermal technology program. I have been active in geothermal and other energy
development throughout the U.S. and internationally for over 35 years and recently
retired  as  the  manager  of  the  U.S.  DOE  Geothermal  Technologies  Program.  I  feel
it is definitely not in the best interest of the Nation to terminate a viable, domestic,
renewable,  non-polluting  energy  resource  at  this  time.  You,  as  the  Subcommittee,
have an opportunity now to make a significant contribution to the U.S. energy port-
folio.

Geothermal  energy  could  play  a  significant  role  in  addressing  the  U.S.  need  for
a  clean  renewable  energy  source.  Historically  electrical  generation  from  geothermal
has  led  both  wind  and  solar  and  supplied  significant  power  to  several  Western
states.  Geothermal  heat  pumps  for  heating  and  cooling  of  homes,  schools  and  busi-
nesses  has  sizable  potential  throughout  the  U.S.  Recent  studies  by  the  Massachu-
setts  Institute  of  Technology  and  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  show
significant  electrical  potential  not  only  in  the  Western  states,  but  indicate  a  strong
potential throughout the U.S.

The  DOE  Geothermal  Program  support  has  resulted  in  significant  technology
breakthrough in areas of exploration, drilling, energy conversion and Enhanced Geo-
thermal  Systems  (EGS),  which  has  resulted  in  the  U.S.  being  a  leader  in  develop-
ment  of  geothermal  energy.  Cost  shared  programs  with  industry  have  stimulated
development of this important and valuable domestic resource and without this sup-
port,  industry  will  not  be  able  to  maintain  its  technological  lead.  DOE  support  to
our national laboratories and universities has resulted in the advances in technology
and  the  training  of  scientists  and  professionals  for  the  future.  Support  to  State  en-
ergy  office  also  has  resulted  in  effective  technology  transfer  to  stimulate  and  expe-
dite geothermal development.

In conclusion, the Subcommittee is at a critical stage in deciding the Nation’s en-
ergy  future  and  I  feel  geothermal  energy  can  play  an  important  role  in  addressing
the needs of the U.S. energy future. We need all of the domestic possibilities for the
U.S.  and  geothermal  is  one  of  the  only  baseload,  non-polluting,  renewable  energy
sources  we  have  available  to  us.  It  could  play  a  significant  role  in  reducing  our  de-
pendence  on  fossil  fuel  and  the  addressing  the  issue  of  climate  change  as  a  result
of CO2 emissions.

I  urge  you  to  support  legislation  to  direct  DOE  to  conduct  the  best  possible  geo-
thermal  research  program  to  tap  the  potential  of  this  resource.  Our  nation  needs
it.  It  would  also  be  a  tragedy  to  see  the  U.S.  lose  its  status  as  a  world  leader  in
geothermal  technology  development  and  the  resultant  decline  in  the  U.S.  Geo-
thermal industry.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Thomsen.
Dr. von Jouanne.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  ANNETTE  VON  JOUANNE,  PROFESSOR  OF
POWER  ELECTRONICS  AND  ENERGY  SYSTEMS,  OREGON
STATE UNIVERSITY
Dr. VON JOUANNE. Thank you. I have a PowerPoint presentation.

It turns out they don’t have it set up so no problem.

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee  and  in  particular
Congresswoman  Hooley,  thank  you  very  much  for  this  opportunity
to  present  to  you  on  wave  energy  opportunities  and  developments,
and  we  are  strongly  in  support  of  this  marine  bill  which  we  think
is  imperative  for  the  United  States  to  lead  the  world  in  wave  en-
ergy research, development and production.

So first off, I would like to state that I am Annette von Jouanne
and  I  am  a  Professor  of  Power  Electronics  and  Energy  Systems.  I
have  been  leading  our  wave  energy  program  at  Oregon  State  Uni-
versity  for  the  past  several  years  and  we  have  a  terrific  group  of
multi-disciplinary faculty including an excellent group of multi-dis-
ciplinary undergraduate and graduate students who are graduating
with a keen understanding of the importance of renewables for our
country,  and  with  a  real  enthusiasm  to  make  a  strong  impact  on
our  energy  future.  At  Oregon  State,  we  have  strong  outreach  ef-
forts to the ocean community, which are coordinated by Oregon Sea
Grant. We have been moving forward in four thrust areas: number
one, to advance research on wave energy devices where we are de-
signing  devices  to  respond  directly  to  the  heaving  motion  of  the
ocean waves and convert that motion into electrical energy. We are
proposing a national wave energy research and demonstration cen-
ter  and  we  are  encouraging  Federal  Government  investment  dol-
lars to further this research.

Wave  energy  is  really  in  the  preliminary  stages  of  development
with  several  topologies  emerging  and  no  clearly  superior  engineer-
ing solutions yet established, and so research and development dol-
lars  are  essential  for  the  Federal  Government  to  really  zero  in  on
these  optimum  topologies,  and  you  will  see  those  topologies  in  the
PowerPoint presentation which I had submitted to you. We also at
Oregon State have been promoting the Oregon coast as an optimal
place for commercial wave parks. Off the West Coast of the United
States  we  now  have  12  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission
preliminary applications for wave parks and of those 12, seven are
off  the  Oregon  coast.  Also,  we  are  looking  to  examine  the  environ-
mental and ecological impacts and we have a workshop planned on
the Oregon coast this summer.

So  the  reason  for  all  the  excitement  in  wave  energy  is  the  tre-
mendous opportunities that we see when compared to other renew-
ables.  When  you  look  at  the  amount  of  energy  that  is  available  in
the  world’s  oceans,  it  is  estimated  that  if  just  0.2  percent  of  that
unharnessed  energy  could  be  tapped,  we  could  power  the  entire
world,  and  of  those  forms  of  ocean  energy,  wave  energy  has  been
identified  to  have  significant  potential  and  significant  advantages
regarding energy density, availability, and predictability, and I am
happy  to  answer  further  questions  on  those  details  during  the
question session.

39

So at Oregon State University, we have strategic facilities to ad-
vance  this  research.  Our  energy  systems  lab,  also  a  wave  research
lab,  has  North  America’s  largest  system  of  wave  basins  and  we
have  plans  for  our  first  ocean  testing  this  summer.  Again  I  want
to  emphasize  that  these  technologies  are  in  the  preliminary  stages
and federal dollars are really necessary in order to zero in on opti-
mal  topologies  to  help  the  U.S.  Government  really  lead  the  world
in  research  and  production.  To  give  you  an  idea,  we  have  done  re-
source  assessments  off  the  Oregon  coast,  and  we  have  found  that
during  the  winter  months  we  see  wave  energy  potentials  in  the
range  of  50  to  60  kilowatt  per  meter  of  crest  length.  Considering
that  an  average  coastal  home  uses  about  1.3  kilowatts,  there  is
substantial raw energy available in our waves.

We  have  substantial  collaboration  in  Oregon  with  our  univer-
sities, with the industry, with the utilities, and we therefore would
like  to  encourage  a  national  wave  energy  research  and  demonstra-
tion center to be located in Oregon in order to advance the research
and the technologies. We are very pleased that the State of Oregon
has  recognized  the  need  for  public  dollar  investment  in  wave  en-
ergy  and  we  encourage  the  Federal  Government  to  invest  in  this
emerging  renewable  technology  so  that  wave  energy  can  be  a
strong component of our country’s renewable energy portfolio.

Thank  you  very  much  for  your  time  and  this  opportunity  to  tes-

tify.

[The prepared statement of Dr. von Jouanne follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ANNETTE VON JOUANNE

I. Introduction to Wave Energy Opportunities and Developments

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  and  Congresswoman  Hooley  in  par-
ticular,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  today  before  this  Subcommittee.  I  am
Annette  von  Jouanne  and  I  am  a  Professor  of  Power  Electronics  and  Energy  Sys-
tems  at  Oregon  State  University.  I  am  honored  to  testify  before  you  today  on  the
subject of Ocean Wave Energy.

Ocean  energy  exists  in  the  forms  of  wave,  tidal,  marine  currents  (from  tidal  flow
streams),  thermal  (temperature  gradient)  and  salinity.  Among  these  forms,  signifi-
cant opportunities and benefits have been identified in the area of wave energy ex-
traction, which will be the focus of this testimony.

When we discuss Wave Energy, we are talking about harnessing the linear motion
of  the  ocean  waves,  and  converting  that  motion  into  electrical  energy.  Waves  have
several  advantages  over  other  forms  of  renewable  energy,  in  that  the  waves  are
more  available  (seasonal,  but  more  constant)  and  more  predictable  with  better  de-
mand  matching.  Wave  energy  also  offers  higher  energy  densities,  enabling  devices
to extract more power from a smaller volume at consequent lower costs and reduced
visual impact.

Oregon  State  University  (OSU)  has  a  multi-disciplinary  Wave  Energy  Team  pur-
suing developments in four thrust areas: 1) researching novel direct-drive wave en-
ergy generators (we are on our fifth and sixth prototypes, with further wave lab and
ocean  testing  planned  this  summer),  2)  developing  an  action  plan  for  a  National
Wave  Energy  Research  and  Demonstration  Center  in  Oregon,  3)  working  closely
with  the  Oregon  Department  of  Energy  (ODOE)  and  a  variety  of  stakeholders  to
promote  Oregon  as  the  optimal  location  for  the  Nation’s  first  commercial  wave
parks,  and  4)  examining  the  biological  and  ecosystem  effects  of  wave  energy  sys-
tems.

II. Current  Ocean  Wave  Energy  Research,  Development  and  Investment

Activities

OSU’s direct-drive wave energy buoy research focuses on a simplification of proc-
esses, i.e., replacing systems employing intermediate hydraulics or pneumatics with
direct-drive  approaches  to  allow  generators  to  respond  directly  to  the  movement  of
the  ocean  by  employing  magnetic  fields  for  contact-less  mechanical  energy  trans-

mission,  and  power  electronics  for  efficient  electrical  energy  extraction.  The  term
‘‘direct’’  drive  describes  the  direct  coupling  of  the  buoy’s  velocity  and  force  to  the
generator without the use of hydraulic fluid or air.

Leading  Wave  Energy  companies,  such  as  Ocean  Power  Technologies  (OPT),
Finavera  Renewables,  Ocean  Power  Delivery  (OPD)  and  Oceanlinx,  are  using  hy-
draulic  and  pneumatic  technologies,  because  it  makes  sense  for  a  company  trying
to  accelerate  their  time  to  a  commercial  market  to  use  more  mature  technologies.
In  the  university  environment,  as  we  are  working  with  students  on  advanced  de-
grees, we endeavor to explore innovative and advanced technologies.

Wave energy developments in the United States are moving forward rapidly, with
twelve  (12)  preliminary  permits  filed  with  FERC  (Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Com-
mission)  for  off  the  West  Coast  (see  Attachment  1).  The  first  commercial  wave  en-
ergy  device  deployments  are  planned  by  the  summer  of  2008.  Remaining  obstacles
include issues of survivability, reliability, maintainability, cost reduction, better un-
derstanding  of  potential  environmental/marine  impacts  and  synergistic  ocean  com-
munity interaction with wave parks. OSU has made great efforts over the past nine
(9) years to develop a leading Wave Energy program, including building strong sup-
port  at  the  state  and  federal  levels,  in  addition  to  building  essential  collaborations
with industries, utilities and the communities along with outreach to the ocean com-
munity of fishermen and crabbers, etc.

III. The Federal Role in Ocean Wave Energy Research and Development

Currently  there  has  been  very  little  investment  by  the  Federal  Government  com-
pared to the rest of the world, and thus as occurred similarly in the wind industry,
the United States is lagging behind other countries in the development of wave en-
ergy  technologies.  For  the  United  States  to  become  a  wave  energy  leader  in  what
is  projected  to  become  a  rapidly  developing  new  set  of  industries,  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment  needs  to  significantly  increase  their  investment  in  wave  energy  research
and development.

It has been reported that since 1999, the British government has committed more
than  £25  million,  or  approximately  $46.7  million,  to  research  and  development  and
£50  million  to  commercialize  that  research,  and  additional  money  to  bring  the  en-
ergy into the electrical grid. In August of 2004, a £5.5 million ($10.72 million) Euro-
pean  Marine  Energy  Center  opened  in  Scotland.  To  date,  the  United  State  has  no
comparable facility.

Ideally,  we  believe  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy,  the  Office  of  Naval  Research,
and  the  National  Oceanographic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  should
all begin investing in Ocean Wave Energy research. However, we believe it is imper-
ative  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  to  become  the  leader  in  this  field  and  to
begin making a robust investment in Wave Energy research. As DOE’s National Re-
newable  Energy  Laboratory  (NREL)  is  charged  with  leading  the  Nation  in  renew-
able  energy  and  energy  efficiency  research  and  development,  it  is  our  belief  that
NREL should establish a unit dedicated to ocean wave energy research.

Along  these  lines,  the  combination  of  key  facilities  at  OSU,  ongoing  successful
wave energy research and collaboration, and a tremendous wave climate off the Or-
egon  coast  has  led  to  the  proposal  of  a  National  Wave  Energy  Research  and  Devel-
opment Center. In order to ensure U.S. leadership in what will become a multi-mil-
lion  dollar  industry  worldwide  (multi-‘‘billion’’  dollar  as  the  wind  industry  is
tracked), the Center could advance wave energy developments through a number of
initiatives  including:  explore  and  compare  existing  ocean  energy  extraction  tech-
nologies,  research  and  develop  advanced  systems,  investigate  efficient  and  reliable
integration  with  the  utility  grid  and  intermittency  issues,  advancement  of  wave
forecasting  technologies,  conduct  experimental  and  numerical  modeling  for  device
and wave park array optimization, develop a framework for understanding and eval-
uating  potential  environmental  and  ecosystem  impacts  of  wave  energy,  establish
protocols  for  how  the  ocean  community  best  interacts  with  wave  energy  devices/
parks, develop wave energy power measurement standards, determine wave energy
device identification/navigation standards, etc.

The Oregon Coast has an excellent Wave Energy climate, and combined with our
strategic  facilities  at  Oregon  State  University,  Oregon  is  in  an  excellent  position  to
advance Wave Energy research, development and production. For example, at OSU,
we  have  the  highest  power  Energy  Systems  lab  in  any  university  in  the  Nation,
where  we  have  conducted  significant  work  in  renewables,  and  where  we  can  fully
regenerate  back  on  to  the  grid  to  comprehensively  research  and  test  renewable  en-
ergy  technologies.  In  addition,  at  OSU  we  have  the  O.H.  Hinsdale  Wave  Research
Lab,  which  has  the  largest  system  of  wave  basins  in  North  America.  At  the  coast
in Newport, Oregon, we have the OSU Hatfield Marine Science Center, where land-
based  facilities  for  a  National  Wave  Energy  Research  and  Demonstration  Center

could  be  integrated.  The  OSU  Hatfield  Marine  Science  Center  campus  is  already
home  to  satellite  labs  and  offices  for  a  number  of  federal  agencies—the  U.S.  Fish
and Wildlife Service, NOAA, EPA, and USDA–ARS.

To  properly  explore  these  Wave  Energy  opportunities,  we  have  been  working
closely with Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) and about 40 other agencies, in-
cluding  the  Oregon  fishing  and  crabbing  industries,  to  enable  the  Nation’s  first
Commercial Wave Parks to be developed off the Oregon Coast.

IV. Other Issues and Conclusion

As  mentioned  above,  a  significant  barrier  to  wave  energy  development  is  the
above-market cost of the electricity. Due to the early stage of this industry, the cur-
rent  cost  of  electricity  production  from  waves  is  estimated  to  be  several  times  the
market  price,  similar  to  wind  when  it  was  emerging  20  years  ago.  To  ensure  the
success of wave energy as a promising renewable contribution to the Nation’s energy
portfolio, the production incentive is very important to offset the above-market costs
of producing ‘wave’ generated electricity. At the federal level, it is critical that wave
energy receive a similar incentive mechanism to the production tax credits that the
wind industry receives.

As  the  Nation  tries  to  meet  its  renewable  energy  goals,  ocean  wave  energy  must
be  a  part  of  the  portfolio.  Given  that  approximately  fifty  percent  of  the  U.S.  popu-
lation lives within fifty miles of the U.S. coastline, we must invest in making ocean
energy  viable—this  cannot  be  done  without  the  robust  support  of  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment’s research agencies.

In the State of Oregon we are very excited to be a leader in wave energy develop-
ment. We have the wave resource, the expertise through collaboration including tre-
mendous  industry,  utility  and  community  support,  and  the  utility  infrastructure
along the coast to deliver this clean, renewable power into the grid.

Thank you for the opportunity to testify before this esteemed Subcommittee.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
Mr. O’Neill.

STATEMENT OF MR. SEAN O’NEILL, PRESIDENT, OCEAN

RENEWABLE ENERGY COALITION

Mr.  O’NEILL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  thank  you  and  your
colleagues  for  devoting  your  time  and  resources  to  the  important
topic of Congresswoman Hooley’s Marine and—is my mic not work-
ing? I can normally fill up a room with my voice. Thank you. How
is that? I think I was at the point of Congresswoman Hooley’s Ma-
rine and Hydrokinetic Energy Research and Development Act.

The Ocean Renewable Energy Coalition is the national trade as-
sociation  for  marine  and  hydrokinetic  renewables  including  wave,
tidal,  ocean  thermal  and  offshore  wind.  We  are  made  up  of  32
members including investment firms, investor-owned utilities, pub-
licly  owned  utilities,  consulting  and  law  firms  in  countries  includ-
ing  the  United  States,  Canada,  Scotland,  Denmark  and  Ireland.
The Electric Power Research Institute recently estimated the wave
and tidal energy resource potential that could be commercially har-
nessed,  not  the  total  potential,  in  the  United  States  as  about  400
million  megawatt-hours  per  year.  That  is  about  10  percent  of  the
national energy supply in 2004.

Projects underway in the United States include Finavera Renew-
ables’  Makah  Bay  project  in  Washington  State,  Verdant  Power’s
Roosevelt Island project with six units that are installed and oper-
ating in the East River of New York City. New Jersey-based Ocean
Power  Technologies  has  projects  in  Hawaii,  New  Jersey  and
Reedsport,  Oregon,  with  clients  including  the  U.S.  Navy  and  the
New  Jersey  Board  of  Public  Utilities.  Multiple  permits  for  sites  in
Maine, California, Oregon, Alaska and Florida have been filed with
the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  including  companies
like Ocean Renewable Power Company, Tacoma Power and Snoho-
mish  PUD  in  Washington  State,  Pacific  Gas  and  Electric  in  Cali-
fornia, and Long Island Power Authority in New York. Europe has
already installed 587 megawatts of offshore wind. Ocean Power De-
livery  of  Scotland  is  presently  developing  the  first  commercial  off-
shore wave farm off the coast of Portugal.

We  are  also  finding  new  technologies  emerging.  University  of
Michigan  has  developed  technology  using  free-flowing  water  and
what they call vortex-induced vibrations which is being further de-
veloped  by  the  company  Vortex  Hydro  Energy.  Offshore  biomass
using kelp and seaweed is also being looked at.

Dr. Robert Cohen, the former manager of Ocean System Division
at  DOE  and  member  of  the  Ocean  Energy  Council,  is  in  the  audi-

ence  today.  He  came  out  from  Colorado,  and  I  am  confident  that
Dr.  Cohen  would  agree  when  I  say  that  encouraging  innovation
and  supporting  those  technologies  with  commercial  potential  is
vital to U.S. interests.

Naturally,  costs  vary  with  the  type  of  technology.  The  Minerals
Management  Service’s  Whitepaper  on  Offshore  Wind  states  that,
where once the cost of offshore wind was about 40 cents a kilowatt-
hour,  over  the  past  20  years  these  costs  have  dropped  to  between
four  and  six  cents.  For  wave,  costs  have  been  estimated  at  nine  to
16  cents  a  kilowatt-hour,  far  more  favorable  than  the  40  cents  a
kilowatt-hour  of  the  early  offshore  wind  experience.  For  instream
tidal, EPRI has predicted costs as low as six to nine cents per kilo-
watt-hour.  Since  the  costs  for  all  renewable  resources  is  free  from
the  fluctuating  cost  of  fuel,  the  cost  of  energy  to  consumers  from
renewable  sources  functions  like  a  fixed-rate  mortgage  as  opposed
to a variable-rate mortgage that resources that carry the burden of
fuel  cost  have.  In  addition,  non-technology  costs  are  expected  to
drop as this industry matures. These include insurance and financ-
ing  costs  as  well  as  much  needed  and  anticipated  regulatory  and
permitting reform.

Yes,  the  United  States  has  fallen  a  bit  behind  other  countries,
but  we  are  on  track  to  quickly  regain  a  competitive  position.  Por-
tugal offers nearly 32 cents a kilowatt-hour in a feed-in tariff. Com-
pare  this  to  1.9  cents  per  kilowatt-hour  that  wind  gets  in  the
United  States.  Britain  offers  25  percent  of  capital  cost  reimburse-
ment for wave and tidal projects.

We need to step up to the plate if we are going to compete. What
the  industry  needs  is  more  R&D  funding  and  technology  develop-
ment  including  programs  like  the  one  at  Oregon  State  University,
resource  assessment,  environmental  studies,  incentives  for  private
investment,  reduced  regulatory  barriers.  Development  of  a  robust
offshore renewables industry can do this. It can reduce our reliance
on  foreign  oil  and  other  carbon-emitting  energy  sources.  It  can  re-
duce  the  demand  for  onshore  land  resources  for  power  generation.
We can revitalize shipyards, coastal industrial parks and shuttered
naval  bases;  create  jobs  in  coastal  communities;  allow  the  United
States  to  export  technology  to  other  countries;  provide  low-cost
power for niche and distributed uses like desalination plants, aqua-
culture,  naval  and  military  bases,  powering  stations  for  hybrid  ve-
hicles and for offshore oil and gas platforms. We could also provide
a  use  for  decommissioned  oil  platforms,  using  a  rigs-to-renewables
program. And last but not least, we could promote coastal planning
that  reflects  the  goals  of  biodiversity  that  maximize  the  best  com-
prehensive  use  of  resources  and  capitalizes  on  synergies  between
offshore  industries.  With  the  proper  support,  ocean  renewable  re-
sources  can  become  a  robust  part  of  a  reliable,  affordable,  clean
electric supply portfolio.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SEAN O’NEILL

Introduction

Ocean  Renewable  Energy  Coalition  is  the  national  trade  association  for  marine
and hydrokinetic renewable energy dedicated to promoting energy technologies from
clean,  renewable  ocean  resources.  The  coalition  is  working  with  industry  leaders,

59

academic  scholars,  and  other  interested  NGO’s  to  encourage  ocean  renewable  tech-
nologies and raise awareness of their vast potential to help secure an affordable, re-
liable, environmentally friendly energy future.

We  seek  a  legislative  and  regulatory  regime  in  the  United  States  that  will  accel-
erate the development of ocean renewable technologies and their commercial deploy-
ment.  While  other  countries  have  already  deployed  viable,  operating,  power  gener-
ating  projects  using  the  emission-free  power  of  ocean  waves,  currents,  and  tidal
forces, the U.S. is only beginning to acknowledge the importance these technologies.
Ocean  energy  can  play  a  significant  role  in  our  nation’s  renewable  energy  port-
folio.  With  the  right  support,  the  United  States  ocean  energy  industry  can  be  com-
petitive  internationally.  With  the  right  encouragement,  ocean  renewable  energy
technologies can help us reduce our reliance on foreign oil—fossil fuels, in general—
and  provide  clean  energy  alternatives  to  conventional  power  generating  systems.
And  with  the  right  public  awareness,  our  coastline  communities  can  use  ocean  re-
newables as a springboard for coastal planning that reflects the principles of marine
biodiversity.  Today,  OREC  will  address  the  steps  that  we  must  take  to  realize  the
promise and potential of ocean renewables.

Is the resource there? Yes, and the resource is located near highly populated areas
on  the  coast,  placing  fewer  demands  on  already  taxed  transmission  infrastructure.
Is  the  resource  cost  competitive?  Not  yet,  but  indications  suggest  a  much  shorter
time  to  commercial  viability  than  experienced  by  many  other  renewable  tech-
nologies.

Is the resource environmentally friendly? Preliminarily yes. We already know that
ocean  renewables  present  some  of  the  most  potentially  environmentally  benign  en-
ergy technologies available today—no air emissions, no fuel costs or associated min-
ing  or  drilling  effects,  no  fuel  transportation  costs.  We  are  still  learning  about  the
effects  of  siting  ocean  renewable  projects,  though  initial  studies  are  showing  mini-
mal  impacts.  A  Draft  Environmental  Impact  Statement  prepared  by  Finavera  Re-
newables  for  its  one  MW  Makah  Bay  project  found  no  significant  impacts;  Ocean
Power  Technologies  has  received  a  ‘‘Finding  of  No  Significant  Impact’’  or  FONSI
from the U.S. Department of the Navy for its project in Hawaii; and most recently,
Verdant Power, Inc. has been monitoring fish behavior at its Roosevelt Island Tidal
Energy  (RITE)  facility  in  New  York  City  since  December  of  2006  with  no  observa-
tions  of  fish  strikes  on  their  turbines.  Verdant  Power’s  experience  began  with  two
underwater  turbines  being  installed  and  monitored  by  more  than  $2  million  of  fish
monitoring equipment including a Didson sonar device that allows scientists and en-
gineers  to  observe  fish  as  they  interact  with  turbines  in  the  river.  They  have  since
installed six (6) turbines and continued monitoring. There are twenty-seven (27) dif-
ferent  species  of  fish  including  herring  and  striped  bass  in  this  section  of  the  East
River. The project is presently producing one Mw/hr/day and scientists are watching
the fish swim around the turbines with no fish striking any of the equipment.

As these are only early indications of how these technologies interact with the ma-
rine  environment  continued  diligence  is  necessary  to  establish  a  thorough  baseline
of information.
Types of Technology

Ocean energy refers to a range of technologies that utilize the oceans or ocean re-
sources  to  generate  electricity.  Many  ocean  technologies  are  also  adaptable  to  non-
impoundment uses in other water bodies such as lakes or rivers. These technologies
can be separated into three main categories:
Wave  Energy  Converters:  These  systems  extract  the  power  of  ocean  waves  and
convert  it  into  electricity.  Typically,  these  systems  use  either  a  water  column  or
some type of surface or just-below-surface buoy to capture the wave power. In addi-
tion to oceans, some lakes may offer sufficient wave activity to support wave energy
converter technology.
Tidal/Current: These systems capture the energy of ocean currents below the wave
surface  and  convert  them  into  electricity.  Typically,  these  systems  rely  on  under-
water  turbines,  either  horizontal  or  vertical,  which  rotate  in  either  the  ocean  cur-
rent or changing tide (either one way or bi-directionally), almost like an underwater
windmill  or  paddle  wheel.  These  technologies  can  be  sized  or  adapted  for  ocean  or
for use in lakes or non-impounded river sites.
Ocean  Thermal  Energy  Conversion  (OTEC):  OTEC  generates  electricity
through  the  temperature  differential  in  warmer  surface  water  and  colder  deep
water. Of ocean technologies, OTEC has the most limited applicability in the United
States  because  it  requires  a  40-degree  temperature  differential  that  is  typically
available in locations like Hawaii and other more tropical climates.

Offshore  Wind:  Offshore  wind  projects  take  advantage  of  the  vast  wind  resources
available across oceans and large water bodies. Out at sea, winds blow freely, unob-
structed  by  any  buildings  or  other  structures.  Moreover,  winds  over  oceans  are
stronger  than  most  onshore,  thus  allowing  for  wind  projects  with  capacity  factors
of as much as 65 percent, in contrast to the 35–40 percent achieved onshore.
Other: Marine  biomass  to  generate  fuel  from  marine  plants  or  other  organic  mate-
rials,  hydrogen  generated  from  a  variety  of  ocean  renewables  and  marine  geo-
thermal power. There are also opportunities for hybrid projects, such as combination
offshore wind and wave or even wind and natural gas.
Q1. Please describe the potential for electric power generation from ocean

renewables. How much energy could the ocean supply?

The  U.S.  wave  and  current  energy  resource  potential  that  could  be  credibly  har-
nessed  is  about  400  TWh/yr  or  about  10  percent  of  2004  national  energy  demand.
EPRI  has  studied  the  U.S.  wave  energy  resource  and  found  it  to  be  about  2,100
TWh/yr  divided  regionally  as  shown  in  the  figure  below.  Assuming  an  extraction  of
15  percent  wave  to  mechanical  energy  (which  is  limited  by  device  spacing,  device
absorption, and sea space constraints), typical power train efficiencies of 90 percent
and  a  plant  availability  of  90  percent,  the  electricity  produced  is  about  260  TWh/
yr or equal to an average power of 30,000 MW (or a rated capacity of about 90,000
MW). This amount is approximately equal to the total 2004 energy generation from
conventional  hydro  power  (which  is  about  6.5  percent  of  total  2004  U.S.  electricity
supply).

EPRI has studied the North America tidal energy potential at fewer than a dozen
selected sites. The tidal energy resource at those U.S. tidal sites alone is 19.6 TWh/
yr. Assuming an extraction of 15 percent tidal kinetic energy to mechanical energy,
typical  power  train  efficiencies  of  90  percent  and  a  plant  availability  of  90  percent,
the  yearly  electricity  produced  at  the  U.S.  sites  studied  is  about  270  MW  (average
power,  rated  capacity  is  about  700  MW).  EPRI  estimates  that  the  total  tidal  and
river in stream potential is on the order of 140 tWh/yr or about 3.5 percent of 2004
national electricity supply.
Q2. Please  describe  the  current  state  of  ocean  power  technologies  in  the

United States and around the world.

The status of U.S. wave, current and tidal projects

At  present,  prototype  offshore  renewable  projects  are  moving  forward  in  the

United States. These include the following:

• Finavera  Renewables,  Inc.,  has  proposed  a  one  MW  pilot  project  for  the
Makah Bay off the coast of Washington State. The project is currently poised
to  complete  a  four-year  permitting  process  at  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory
Commission (FERC).
• New  York  based  Verdant  Power  is  undergoing  licensing  at  FERC  and  de-

environmental review of the proposed 420 MW Cape Wind Farm off the coast
of Nantucket, MA and LIPA/FPL 100 MW project off the coast of Long Island,
NY.

Status of Ocean Renewable Projects Overseas

In  Europe,  projects  are  moving  ahead.  Europe  has  already  installed  587  MW  of
offshore  wind  in  Denmark,  Holland,  Scotland,  England  and  UK.  See  http://
www.bwea.com/offshore/worldwide.html

Two  near-shore  wave  projects,  are  operating  in  Scotland  and  Isle  of  Azores.
Pelamis of OPD in Scotland is deploying the world’s first commercial wind farm off
the  coast  of  Portugal  and  Marine  Current  Turbines  has  operated  a  prototype  tidal
project for two years.
Q3. What  is  the  consumer  price,  per  kWh,  of  ocean  generated  electricity.

What are the projections for reduction in that price.

Naturally,  costs  vary  with  the  type  of  technology.  The  MMS  Whitepaper  on  Off-
shore Wind states that where once the cost of offshore wind was around forty cents/
kWH, over the past twenty years, costs have dropped to between four and six cents/
kwh. By 2012 and beyond, DOE envisions five MW and larger machines generating
power for five cents/kWh.

Cost estimates are more difficult for wave and tidal, which in contrast to offshore
wind, lack operational history. For wave, costs have been estimated as between nine
and  16  cents/kWh,  far  more  favorable  than  the  40  cents/kWH  that  offshore  wind
cost  ‘‘out  of  the  box.’’  For  in-stream  tidal,  the  EPRI  reports  predicted  costs  as  low
as  six  to  nine  cents/kWH  because  tidal  power’s  similarities  to  wind  allow  it  to  ben-
efit  from  the  advancements  already  made  by  wind  and  potentially  share  economies
of scale.

And,  the  costs  of  offshore  wind  or  wave  are  stable.  Whereas  natural  gas  and  oil
have  fluctuated  over  the  years  (with  natural  gas  now  higher  than  ever),  offshore
wind  and  wave  energy  costs  are  stable,  since  the  cost  of  renewable  power  sources
like  wind  or  wave  are  free.  The  analogy  here  is  that  the  cost  to  consumers  for
renewable  energy,  free  from  the  fluctuating  costs  of  fuel,  functions  like  a
fixed-rate mortgage as opposed to a variable rate mortgage associated with
the use of finite fossil fuel resources.

Also,  costs  are  expected  to  decline  as  the  industry  matures  and  as  economies  of
scale make ocean projects less costly. As the offshore wind industry makes advance-
ments on mooring systems, turbine durability and other issues that bear on the cost
of marine projects, these advancements will help bring down the cost of other ocean
energy technologies. In addition, if we can gain a better assessment of our resources,
we  can  target  the  most  powerful  sites  first  and  learn  from  our  experience  in  these
locations to bring costs down further.

It  is  important  to  note  that  non-technology  costs  associated  with  these  types  of
projects  will  also  be  reduced  as  the  industry  matures.  These  include  insurance  and
financing,  as  well  as  much  needed  and  anticipated  regulatory  and  permitting  re-
form.
Q4. Is  the  United  States  behind  other  countries  in  the  development  of  the

technology? Is this a result of a lack of federal investment?

Yes,  the  United  States  has  fallen  behind  countries  like  Scotland,  Portugal,  Nor-
way,  and  others;  however,  we  are  on  a  track  to  quickly  regain  a  leading  position.
Portugal  offers  a  ÷.235/kWH  [equivalent  to  nearly  $.32  (U.S.) ]  feed-in  tariff.  Com-
pare  this  to  the  U.S.,  where  the  wind  industry  receives  approximately  $.019/kWH.
and ocean renewables receive nothing. Britain pays substantial incentives including
capital cost reimbursements of 25 percent. The United States needs to match these
foreign  incentives  in  order  to  attract  and  retain  world  class  technology  developers.
Permitting  and  regulatory  obstacles  are  tremendous  disincentives  to  companies
developing ocean renewable projects in the United States, as well. While other coun-
tries  have  adopted  permitting  and  regulatory  regimes  that  appear  to  be  more  effi-
cient,  the  United  States  is  still  struggling  with  exactly  how  to  permit  and  regulate
these technologies.
Q5. What  kind  of  technological  obstacles  remain  to  the  commercial  viabil-

ity of ocean power?

Advances  in  a  number  of  other  sectors  have  benefited  the  marine  renewable  in-
dustry  sector  including  advanced  materials,  turbine  design,  and  offshore  construc-
tion.  Listed  below  are  the  present  day  R&D  requirements  to  support  the  develop-
ment of marine and hydrokinetic technologies in the United States.

Q6. What  can  Congress  and/or  the  Federal  Government  do  to  help  move
the  technology  forward?  Is  there  a  role  for  federal  support  for  R&D?
Why is federal spending necessary?

The first thing Congress can do is pass designed to accomplish the following:
—More  funding  for  R&D  and  technology  development:  Wind  energy  has
benefited  from  substantial  government  investment.  Thirty  years  ago,  wind  cost  30
cents/kWH  to  generate;  today,  that  cost  stands  at  three  to  seven  cents/kWH.  And
even  today,  DOE  continues  to  invest  in  wind.  Just  a  few  months  ago,  DOE  an-
nounced a $27 million partnership with GE to develop large-scale turbines and also
issued  a  $750,000  SBIR  to  Northern  Power  for  offshore  wind  technology  develop-
ment.

Private  developers  have  borne  the  costs  of  bringing  the  ocean  energy  technology
forward  for  the  past  thirty  years,  but  they  need  government  support.  Government
funding  will  also  give  confidence  to  private  investors  and  help  attract  private  cap-
ital.

—Resource  Assessment:  At  present,  we  do  not  even  know  the  full  potential  of
offshore  renewables,  because  no  agency  has  ever  mapped  the  resource  comprehen-
sively.  The  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  directed  the  Secretary  of  DOE  to  inventory
our  renewable  resources  but  that  work  has  never  been  funded.  And  even  as  MMS
moves  forward  with  a  rule-making  for  offshore  renewables  on  the  OCS,  it  has  not
received appropriations to map the resource.

Preliminary studies done by EPRI and private companies show that we have sub-
stantial  ocean  resources.  But  we  will  not  know  the  full  scope  without  further  map-
ping and study.

—Incentives for Private Investment: Offshore renewables are compatible with
other  large  industries  in  our  country,  such  as  oil  and  maritime  industry.  These  in-
dustries,  with  the  right  tax  incentives,  can  provide  substantial  support  to  offshore
renewable  development.  Incentives  could  include  investment  tax  credits  for  invest-
ment  in  offshore  renewables  and  incentive  to  use  abandoned  shipyards  and  decom-
missioned platforms for prototypes and demonstration projects.

—Incentives  for  coastal  communities:  Coastal  municipalities  stand  to  gain
tremendously from installation of offshore renewables. They need to be stakeholders
in  the  process  with  a  voice  in  development  that  takes  place  off  their  shores.  Con-
gress  can  support  this  by  continuing  to  authorize  Clean  Renewable  Energy  Bonds
(CREBS) and the Renewable Energy Portfolio Incentives (REPI) for coastal projects.
—Reduced  regulatory  barriers:  Until  companies  get  projects  in  the  water,  we
will not learn about the environmental impacts or true costs of offshore renewables.
Unfortunately,  developers  face  onerous  barriers  to  siting  small,  experimental
projects. We should establish streamlined regulation and permitting for offshore re-
newables, with maximum cooperation between State and federal agencies.

Conclusion

Development of a robust offshore renewables industry can:

• Reduce reliance on foreign oil
• Rely  upon  ocean  terrain  for  power  generation  as  opposed  to  onshore  land  re-

sources

• Revitalize shipyards, coastal industrial parks and shuttered naval bases
• Create jobs in coastal communities
• Allow the U.S. to transfer technology to other countries, just as a country like

Scotland is exporting its marine renewables know-how

• Provide  low  cost  power  for  niche  or  distributed  uses  like  desalination  plants,
aquaculture,  naval  and  military  bases,  powering  stations  for  hybrid  vehicles
and for offshore oil and gas platforms

• Provide use for decommissioned oil platforms through ‘‘rigs to reefs program’’
• Promote coastal planning that reflects the goals of biodiversity, that maximize
best comprehensive use of resources and capitalizes on synergies between off-
shore industries.

Is the resource there? Yes, and the resource is located near highly populated areas
on  the  coast,  placing  fewer  demands  on  already  taxed  transmission  infrastructure.
The United States cannot afford to ignore

Ocean  renewables  can  help  diversify  our  energy  portfolio  and  improve  our  envi-
ronment.  With  the  proper  support,  these  resources  will  become  a  robust  part  of  a
reliable, affordable, clean electric supply portfolio.

STATEMENT OF MR. NATHANAEL GREENE, SENIOR POLICY

ANALYST, NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL

Mr.  GREENE.  Mr.  Chairman,  esteemed  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee,  thank  you  very  much  for  having  me  here  today.  My  name
is Nathanael Greene. I am a senior policy analyst with the Natural
Resources  Defense  Council.  I  spent  a  lot  of  time  trying  to  think  of
a  good  joke  that  bridges  geothermal  and  ocean  energy  but  I  just
couldn’t come up with one. So I will just leap right in here.

I think it is very appropriate that Congressman McNerney raised
the  history  of  the  wind  energy  industry,  onshore  wind  energy  in-
dustry association. I think if we look at that, we can see one of the
main  points  that  I  would  like  to  talk  about  today,  which  is  why
when  we  do  research  and  development,  it  is  important  to  include
the  environmental  impacts  and  study  the  baseline  environmental
conditions,  the  ecosystem  conditions,  the  environmental  inter-
actions  of  the  technologies  that  we  are  looking  at.  We  are  now  at
the fortunate stage in the onshore energy industry that we are see-
ing a lot of concentration of projects in certain parts of the country
and  so  states  have  started  to  come  together  individually  and  as
groups  to  really  try  to  understand  what  the  cumulative  impacts  of
large-scale  development  will  be,  and  I  think  as  we  look  forward  to
expanding  these  technologies  and  NRDC  certainly  comes  at  these
two technologies in reviewing these two bills with the hope that we
can  make  these  technologies  large-scale  contributors  to  our  energy
mix. But as we come at them, we need to think not just about what
one  project  will  look  like,  or  what  one  pilot  installation  will  look
like,  but  what  many  projects  will  look  like.  Particularly  in  the
ocean technologies, which are tapping an energy source that is gen-
erally  less  dense  than,  say,  a  fossil  fuel  or  even  some  of  the  other
renewable energy resources, the individual installation may just be

one  of  hundreds  of  individual  pieces  of  equipment  that  make  up  a
single  project.  When  you  are  looking  at  multiple  projects  in  some
areas,  you  may  be  looking  at  many,  many  pieces  of  equipment.  So
thinking about cumulative impact from the get-go is absolutely crit-
ical.

Similarly,  in  the  wind  energy  industry  association  and  the  his-
tory, we can see the really significant impacts of an early black eye
in  the  development  of  the  industry.  If  you  look  out  in  California
with the Altamont Pass project and the history of that project and
its  impacts  particularly  on  endangered  bird  species,  they  have  cre-
ated  at  least  two  decades  of  slowdown  in  the  development  of  that
industry  and  questions  around  the  development  of  that  industry
that could have been avoided if we had done more research and de-
velopment,  understood  better  what  the  interactions  of  wildlife  and
technology were from the get-go, and instead of developing some of
our first projects in very sensitive areas, found better places where
there  were  still  good  resources  but  fewer  potential  impacts,  we
might  have  been  able  to  avoid  that  whole  diversion  and  unfortu-
nate slowdown in the industry.

And  the  last  point  I  would  like  to  make  is  really  about  the  per-
mitting.  Building  this  baseline  of  information,  the  consensus  be-
tween  regulators,  the  public,  and  the  industry  about  what  are  the
real, valid environmental concerns and what are the red herrings—
the  issues  that  are  just  distracting  us  in  the  permitting  process—
can  really  help  an  open  and  transparent  regulatory  process  and
speed  up  permitting  without  giving  up  the  important  aspects  of
permitting  to  really  guide  the  industry  towards  responsible  devel-
opment.

So  building  on  that  basic  recommendation,  particularly  in  the
geothermal  research  and  development  act  that  we  are  looking  at
today, I think it is very important that we call out looking at envi-
ronmental  studies  and  environmental  impacts.  The  ocean  thermal
energy act has a particular section on that. I think it is something
I  would  recommend  the  Committee  consider  adding  to  the  geo-
thermal  act.  A  lot  of  making  sure  that  that  sort  of  research  done
unfortunately  is  going  to  fall  back  on  you  in  your  oversight  as  the
research and development actually occurs because you can’t micro-
manage that from this stage, so I would encourage you particularly
to look, and encourage the implementing agencies to look, at high-
resources  areas.  Let  us  really  focus  our  dollars,  build  baselines  so
we  can  really  understand  not  just  what  the  actual  potential  is  but
in  these  high-resource  areas,  what  is  the  baseline  ecosystem,  and
it  helps  us  not  just  site  an  individual  project,  which  will  need  to
have  that  information  as  they  go  through  the  siting  process,  but
also  start  to  allow  us  to  think  about  what  the  cumulative  impacts
will be of multiple projects, and similarly, to recognize that because
these  technologies  are  basically  in  their  nascency  right  now,  there
are  a  lot  of  unknowns  around  how  these  technologies  will  interact
with  the  environment.  I  am  sure  there  is  a  known  unknown  joke
here but I am not going to make that one.

We need to through the environmental research and development
and  really  try  to  narrow  the  questions  that  we  cannot  answer  at
this  point,  characterize  those  issues  as  close,  as  specifically  as  we
can so that they don’t act as bottlenecks in the permitting process,

66

and  then  study  them  extensively  in  the  lesson-learned  stage  after
we  build  the  first  projects.  Particularly  I  would  call  out  the  need
and the role that this research and development plays in a critical
permitting  tool  which  we  need  to  develop  much  more  extensively
now  and  especially  for  these  new  technologies,  which  is  adaptive
management.  If  we  can’t  figure  out  a  way  to  permit  projects  with-
out perfect information, we are going to see a real resistance on the
part of the public to seeing these technologies go forward, but if we
can  figure  out  a  way  to  allow  the  projects  to  go  forward  but  also
change  the  management  if  unanticipated  impacts  start  to  develop,
we can speed the process up.

On  the  specific  technologies,  the  enhanced  geothermal  systems,
very exciting but also very much unknown. I don’t think that there
are likely to be huge impacts there. I am not anticipating that but
again, if we don’t study it, that uncertainty will act as a break and
so  focusing  research  and  development  dollars  there  to  build  that
consensus is absolutely critical.

Another  point  I  would  draw  just  between  the  environmental  im-
pacts  and  the  technology  research  and  development  around  geo-
thermal  is  the  critical  need  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  those  sys-
tems,  the  total  thermal  efficiency.  The  more  we  can  actually  cap-
ture  of  the  geothermal  energy,  the  fewer  projects  we  ultimately
need to build to develop any certain amount of energy.

On  the  ocean  side,  again  to  recognize  that  we  are  dealing  with
a  relatively  unique  environment,  thinking  now  about  the  cumu-
lative impacts and the consensus is absolutely critical.

Thank you for your time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF NATHANAEL GREENE

Summary
General

• Carve  out  federal  research  and  development  (R&D)  dollars  for  independent
studies of environmental impacts to 1) understand the cumulative impacts of
large scale deployment of these ocean and geothermal energy technologies, 2)
avoid early public black-eyes that will set the industry back years, and 3) sup-
port  an  open  and  transparent  permitting  and  regulatory  process  by  building
consensus  among  regulators,  the  public,  and  industry  around  the  environ-
mental benefits and impacts of real concern.

• Look  at  regions  with  resources  that  have  high  energy  production  potential
and  build  baseline  data  on  the  nature  of  the  resource  and  the  ecosystems  in
place that surround the resources.

• Use  the  baseline  data  and  analogous  technologies  to  narrow  and  bound  un-

knowable potential environmental impacts.

• Focus ‘‘lessons learned’’ studies on the areas of greatest environmental uncer-

tainty.

• Use  these  studies  to  inform  adaptive  management  strategies  so  that  projects
can proceed in the face of the real uncertainty surrounding some impacts and
also still be eligible for private sector financing.

• Consider  a  federal  fund  to  support  the  more  extensive  potential  adaptive

management options including removal for the first few projects.

• Utilize  early  successes  in  this  approach  as  test  cases  for  future,  more  large-

scale deployment initiatives.

• Include  independent  R&D  on  the  environmental  impacts  of  geothermal  tech-
nologies  in  the  Advanced  Geothermal  Energy  Research  and  Development  Act
of 2007.
• Build  consensus  among  regulators,  the  public,  and  industry  around  the  real
environmental  impacts  and  ways  to  avoid,  manage,  and  mitigate  these  im-
pacts so that the technologies can be deployed as quickly as possible.
• Ensure that studies cover the environmental impacts of enhanced geothermal
systems  and  of  the  cumulative  effects  of  multiple  large-scale  projects  in  the
same region.
• Ensure  that  technology  R&D  covers  improving  the  thermal  efficiency  of  geo-
thermal  systems  to  maximize  the  potential  energy  that  can  be  captured  and
minimize the number of projects that need to be developed.

Introduction

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  share  my  views  on  geothermal,  ocean,  and
hydrokinetic  energy  technologies,  the  environmental  pros  and  cons  of  these  impor-
tant  sources  of  renewable  energy,  and  the  environmental  issues  related  to  these
technologies that should be addressed in the context of federally supported research
and development. My name is Nathanael Greene. I’m a senior policy analyst for the
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and one of our main experts on renew-
able  energy  technologies.  NRDC  is  a  national,  nonprofit  organization  of  scientists,
lawyers and environmental specialists dedicated to protecting public health and the
environment.  Founded  in  1970,  NRDC  has  more  than  1.2  million  members  and  on-
line activists nationwide, served from offices in New York, Washington, Los Angeles
and San Francisco.

Mr.  Chairman  and  esteemed  Members  of  this  committee,  as  you  know,  U.S.  en-
ergy policy needs to address three major challenges: reducing global warming pollu-
tion,  providing  affordable  energy  services  that  sustain  a  robust  economy,  and  in-
creasing  our  energy  security.  Renewable  energy  technologies  including  geothermal,
ocean,  and  hydrokinetic  energy  can  play  a  critical  role  in  meeting  these  goals,  and
these technologies have the potential for dramatically increased deployment over the
coming decades. These sources of energy can be used to produce electricity and ther-
mal  energy  with  little  or  no  global  warming  pollution  or  local  or  regional  air  pollu-
tion,  and  they  draw  on  domestic  energy  sources  that  are  naturally  replenished  and
do  not  vary  in  cost.  By  using  these  technologies  we  avoid  burning  fossil  fuels,  par-
ticularly  coal  and  natural  gas  and  to  a  lesser  degree  oil.  The  heat-trapping  gases
released  when  we  burn  these  fuels  make  the  power  sector  the  largest  single  source
of global warming pollution. These fuels are also responsible for other significant en-
vironmental and public health impacts during mining, drilling, processing, and com-
bustion, and they expose our economy to price volatility and energy insecurity.

All energy technologies cause some environmental damage. Being better than fos-
sil  fuels  is  a  necessary  condition,  but  hardly  sufficient.  Independent  research  and
development  focused  on  the  environmental  characteristics  of  these  technologies  is

critical  to  maximizing  their  positive  impacts  and  to  avoiding,  managing,  and  miti-
gating their negative ones. Good R&D on the environmental impacts is also critical
to  an  open  and  transparent  permitting  process  and  in  building  a  constructive  rela-
tionship between regulators, the public, and the industry so that these technologies
can be deployed in a manner that is quick, efficient and responsible.
General Comments Relevant to Both Families of Technologies

The  environmental  impacts  of  renewable  technologies  such  as  geothermal,  ocean
and hydrokinetic energy must be considered in the context of the detrimental alter-
native  outcomes  if  we  choose  to  not  actively  deploy  these  technologies.  Most  of  the
traditional energy sources (e.g., coal, natural gas, oil) ensure a far different and po-
tentially  much  more  devastating  environmental  future.  Meeting  our  energy  service
needs  through  improved  energy  efficiency  is  the  fastest,  cleanest,  cheapest  option,
but  even  the  most  efficient  technologies  require  some  energy  to  operate.  Outside  of
the  transportation  sector,  if  we’re  not  using  renewable  energy  then  chances  are
we’re using coal, natural gas, and nuclear power and some oil primarily for heating.
The  consequences  of  not  moving  away  from  these  traditional  fuels  to  energy  effi-
ciency and renewable energy are severe, and impact almost every aspect of the envi-
ronment and public health. None of these consequences are ultimately more urgent
than  reducing  global  warming.  The  recent  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate
Change report concluded that there was at least a 90 percent chance that heat-trap-
ping pollution was the main cause of warming since 1950. The science is clear: glob-
al warming is real, it’s already occurring, and we’re responsible for it. We can avoid
catastrophic  damage,  but  only  if  we  start  reducing  our  rate  of  pollution  seriously
within the next 10 years and achieve 60 to 80 percent reductions by 2050.

This  is  where  renewable  energy  technologies  such  as  geothermal,  ocean,  and
hydrokinetic  energy  can  be  so  beneficial.  The  heat-trapping  gases  emitted  during
combustion  of  fossil  fuels  make  the  power  sector  the  largest  single  source  of  global
warming  pollution.  Developing  geothermal,  ocean,  and  hydrokinetic  energy,  as  part
of  a  renewable  energy  portfolio,  is  a  vital  step  towards  replacing  a  significant
amount  of  the  fossil  fuel-generated  power.  Moreover,  there  is  a  domestic  argument
as well. The United States is the largest emitter of heat-trapping gases, causing 25
percent  of  global  warming  despite  having  just  four  percent  of  the  world  population.
Geothermal, ocean, and hydrokinetic energy are domestic renewable energy sources
that  can  reduce  our  carbon  footprint  globally,  and  encourage  other  countries  to  do
the same.

Of  course,  no  energy  technology  is  without  environmental  impacts,  and  simply
being  better  than  fossil  fuels  is  a  little  like  being  better  than  a  poke  in  the  eye—
it’s a necessary but not sufficient aspect of a truly sustainable energy mix. Studying
the  environmental  characteristics  of  renewables  serves  two  critical  purposes:  1)  it
allows  us  to  identify,  avoid,  manage,  and  mitigate  the  real  environmental  impacts
of  renewable  energy  technologies;  and  2)  it  builds  a  constructive  relationship  be-
tween regulators, the public, and industry that focuses on the real impacts and not
‘‘red  herring’’  issues  that  have  limited  impact  and  can  obstruct  the  deployment  of
strong projects. Taken together these outcomes are needed to allow for the best pub-
lic review and permitting process.

Ocean  energy  is  currently  used  to  produce  just  a  few  megawatts  and  geothermal
just  a  few  thousand  megawatts  of  energy,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  both  families  of
technologies  could  easily  be  scaled  up  to  produce  tens  of  gigawatts  within  the  next
few decades. However, the relative infancy of these technologies presents two impor-
tant challenges. First to understand the real sustainability of the technologies, it is
insufficient to look at the impacts from a single project. We must also study the cu-
mulative  impact  of  these  technologies  brought  fully  to  scale,  and  lay  out  our  vision
of  what  we  want  these  industries  to  ultimately  become.  Second,  both  families  of
technologies  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  major  setbacks  that  could  stifle  growth
if early projects become notorious environmental failures.

In  the  context  of  federal  research  and  development  legislation,  we  should  focus
on  two  types  of  environmental  risks  to  understand  the  cumulative  impacts  and
avoid  early  public  black-eyes.  The  first  type  of  risk  involves  impacts  that  we  can
predict with increasing accuracy with greater experience and data collection. An ex-
ample  of  this  type  of  risk  would  be  determining  the  chance  of  whales  being  hurt
by the sounds of construction. The more we learn about whales’ habits in the region
of the project, and what effective mitigation measures we can take to avoid and min-
imize  impacts  on  whales,  the  more  we  can  quantify  the  probability  of  whales  being
affected by project construction.

The  second  type  of  risk  involves  impacts  that  we  cannot  predict  because  they  re-
sult from new types of interaction that simply have never occurred before. An exam-
ple of this type of risk would be how a geofluid would spread when introduced into

a  hot-dry  rock  geothermal  heat  source  to  create  an  engineered  aquifer.  Another  ex-
ample  would  be  how  fish  might  adapt  to  underwater  turbines  in  a  river.  These
would  be  first-of-a-kind  interactions  and  the  probability  of  the  possible  impacts  is
fundamentally unknowable.

We can address the first kind of risk by building a detailed understanding of the
baseline  conditions  in  the  area  of  a  potential  project.  Unfortunately,  given  that
many  species  may  pass  through  a  given  part  of  the  ocean  or  land  only  during  cer-
tain seasons, developing this database may significantly slow a proposed project. If,
instead  of  studying  the  baselines  on  a  project-by-project  basis,  we  identified  a  few
regions  with  high  resource  potential,  and  focused  federal  R&D  dollars  on  building
the necessary baseline data in those areas, we could facilitate the permitting of indi-
vidual  projects.  This  would  help  us  develop  a  better  understanding  of  what  the  cu-
mulative impacts might be in a region where multiple projects are likely.

Research  and  development  dollars  can  also  help  narrow  and  bound  the  uncer-
tainty associated with unknowable risks. For instance, if we were considering a cer-
tain  type  of  ocean  thermal  technology,  previously  collected  baseline  data  would
allow  us  to  conclude  that  a  project  in  that  region  of  the  ocean  would  have  a  very
low chance of interacting with endangered or at-risk fish populations. Further study
of similar equipment coupled with modeling the worst-case scenarios might allow us
to  conclude  that  even  the  development  of  multiple  projects  would  be  very  unlikely
to have any significant impacts of the fish populations. In other words, even for un-
knowable  risks  associated  with  putting  new  technologies  into  new  conditions,  fed-
eral  R&D  can  help  build  consensus  around  the  issues  of  greatest  potential  concern
and those that are very unlikely to impose significant restraints.

Of  course  this  type  of  work  should  be  followed  with  ‘‘lessons  learned’’  studies  to
help  avoid,  manage,  and  mitigate  future  impacts  and  provide  more  information  to
help narrow and bound other unknowable risks. Indeed, given the much higher level
of uncertainty surrounding these technologies, the lessons learned from each project
during  operation  should  be  used  to  update  the  management  of  future  projects,  and
the  conditions  of  future  permits,  especially  during  the  early  development  stage  of
each  industry.  In  particular  these  studies  should  be  used  to  inform  adaptive  man-
agement  requirements  in  permits.  Adaptive  management  requirements  establish  a
process  for  changing  a  project  operations  and  equipment  configuration  to  avoid  or
reduce environmental impacts that are larger than anticipated. This is a critical tool
for  allowing  projects  proceed  when  there  is  a  level  of  uncertainty  around  impacts
that  would  be  unacceptable  if  the  projects’  management  strategies  are  fixed  over
time.

Further  research  on  the  potential  environmental  impacts  associated  with  these
nascent  renewable  technologies  is  needed  to  support  adaptive  management  permit-
ting requirements. Given the limits on our ability to establish baseline data and the
unknowable  risks  associated  with  new  technologies  in  new  conditions,  regulators
must be able to require projects to adapt their management to address unacceptable
levels  of  impacts  (that  may  not  appear  at  present).  The  baseline  data  and  studies
to  narrow  and  bound  unknowable  risks  will  be  critical  to  identifying  unacceptable
levels  of  impacts  (e.g.,  is  the  line  crossed  at  one  bird  or  fish  or  caribou  or  one  hun-
dred?) and what alternative management options are possible.

Making adaptive management work is not only important from the environmental
perspective; it is also critical to making projects acceptable for private sector financ-
ing. Lenders and investors will not support projects that face potentially significant
costs  or  lost  capacity  as  a  result  of  management  being  forced  to  avoid  or  manage
an  unforeseen  impact.  Developing  a  clear,  transparent  permitting  process,  that  in-
cludes  State  and  federal  agency  input  in  developing  adaptive  management  require-
ments, will also help attract private funding.

Indeed,  given  the  importance  of  adaptive  management  to  making  some  first-of-a-
kind  projects  acceptable  from  an  ecological  and  public  health  risk  perspective,  and
the  challenge  that  some  adaptive  management  options  might  pose  to  a  project’s  fi-
nancing, the Federal Government could play an important facilitating role in ensur-
ing  geothermal,  ocean,  and  hydrokinetic  energy  deployment.  The  government  could
create  a  fund  that  covers  a  portion  of  the  costs  associated  with  the  most  extreme
and  expensive  changes  in  management  that  might  be  necessary  for  early  projects.
For  example,  if  there  is  a  very  small  chance  that  geofluid  could  leak  from  an  engi-
neered  aquifer  into  ground  water  or  to  the  surface,  but  such  a  leak  would  require
the project to immediately cease operations, the Federal Government could help in-
sure  against  such  a  risk  for  the  first  few  projects.  I  recognize  that  this  specific  rec-
ommendation is beyond the scope of R&D legislation, but the types of studies I have
discussed above would help identify and limit the conditions where this type of fund
would be necessary.

Recommendations

70

• Carve  out  federal  research  and  development  (R&D)  dollars  for  independent
studies of environmental impacts to 1) understand the cumulative impacts of
large scale deployment of these ocean and geothermal energy technologies, 2)
avoid early public black-eyes that will set the industry back years, and 3) sup-
port  an  open  and  transparent  permitting  and  regulatory  process  by  building
consensus  among  regulators,  the  public,  and  industry  around  the  environ-
mental benefits and impacts of real concern.

• Look  at  regions  with  resources  that  have  high  energy  production  potential
and build baseline data on nature of the resource and the ecosystems in place
that surround the resources.

• Use  the  baseline  data  and  analogous  technologies  to  narrow  and  bound  un-

knowable potential environmental impacts.

• Focus ‘‘lessons learned’’ studies on the areas of greatest environmental uncer-

tainty.

• Use  these  studies  to  inform  adaptive  management  strategies  so  that  projects
can proceed in the face of the real uncertainty surrounding some impacts and
also still be eligible for private sector financing.

• Consider  a  federal  fund  to  support  the  more  extensive  potential  adaptive

management options including removal for the first few projects.

• Utilize  early  successes  in  this  approach  as  test  cases  for  future,  more  large-

scale deployment initiatives.

Geothermal

Geothermal energy is a particularly attractive source of renewable energy because
it  can  serve  as  baseload  power  (e.g.,  provide  steady  electricity  on  a  consistent  and
predictable  basis).  This  gives  it  the  potential  to  displace  some  of  the  dirtiest  power
generation—coal-fired  baseload  power.  Direct  use  of  geothermal  heat  and  geo-
thermal  heat-pump  technology  also  allows  industry,  commercial,  and  residential
buildings  to  avoid  natural  gas  and  oil  that  are  currently  used  for  heating  and  cool-
ing needs.

There are already an important number of geothermal projects in operation today,
but  the  next  10  to  15  years  could  easily  see  a  ten-fold  increase  in  deployment.  In
addition,  enhanced  geothermal  systems  represent  a  new  technology  and  an  area  of
significant  potential  growth.  As  a  result,  it  is  important  that  the  R&D  bills  under
consideration  by  the  Subcommittee  be  amended  to  explicitly  require  research  and
development  related  to  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  geothermal  develop-
ment along the lines discussed above.

For  the  traditional  geothermal  technologies,  R&D  would  help  especially  in  terms
of  building  consensus  among  regulators,  the  public,  and  industry  around  the  most
significant  environmental  impacts.  It  could  also  prove  useful  in  determining  which
impacts  are  ‘‘red  herrings’’  that  might  need  to  be  monitored,  but  don’t  need  to  be
a  focus  of  concern.  However,  it  is  important  to  recognize  that  many  geothermal  re-
sources  are  remote  from  demand  centers  and  thus  land-use  impacts  will  grow  con-
siderably with cumulative development of multiple projects in the same region.

Beyond  the  traditional  geothermal  technology,  the  enhanced  geothermal  systems
are  an  entirely  new  area  for  development  and  thus  even  more  in  need  of  R&D  on
their  potential  environmental  impacts.  Particular  care  must  be  taken  that  the
geofluids  injected  to  bring  the  geothermal  energy  to  the  surface  do  not  escape  the
targeted  heat  reservoir  and  contaminate  drinking  water  or  reach  the  surface  in  an
uncontrolled manner. Research into the steps necessary to avoid this and to under-
stand the potential impacts of such an escape if it occurred would increase the com-
fort-level with this new technology.

For  all  classes  of  geothermal  technologies,  a  key  area  of  technology  R&D  that
overlaps  with  siting-related  environmental  impacts  is  work  to  improve  the  thermal
efficiency of the technologies. The efficiency of current projects is unfortunately low.
Doubling this would cut in half the number of projects necessary to achieve a given
level of energy production.
Recommendations

• Include  independent  R&D  on  the  environmental  impacts  of  geothermal  tech-
nologies  in  the  Advanced  Geothermal  Energy  Research  and  Development  Act
of 2007.

71

• Build  consensus  among  regulators,  the  public,  and  industry  around  the  real
environmental  impacts  and  ways  to  avoid,  manage,  and  mitigate  these  im-
pacts so that the technologies can be deployed as quickly as possible.

• Ensure that studies cover the environmental impacts of enhanced geothermal
systems  and  of  the  cumulative  effects  of  multiple  large-scale  projects  in  the
same region.

• Ensure  that  technology  R&D  covers  improving  the  thermal  efficiency  of  geo-
thermal  systems  to  maximize  the  potential  energy  that  can  be  captured  and
minimize the number of projects that need to be developed.

Ocean and hydrokinetic energy

There  are  three  reasons  that  study  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  ocean  and
hydrokinetic energy is particularly important: 1) the technology is in a nascent stage
of  development  with  only  a  few  pilot  scale  projects  in  operation  around  the  world;
2)  due  to  the  diffuse  nature  of  the  energy  resource  in  the  ocean  and  moving  water,
this family of technologies necessarily requires many pieces of equipment spread out
over  great  distances  to  capture  traditional  electric  utility-scale  amounts  of  elec-
tricity;  and  3)  the  oceans  are  prized  for  their  open  vistas,  importance  in  the  global
ecosystem, and are particularly vulnerable to global warming.

As recommended above, R&D looking at the environmental impacts of this family
of technologies should focus on a few regions with especially high resource potential,
ideally  for  multiple  technologies.  Studying  the  ecosystems  of  oceans,  rivers,  and
lakes  is  obviously  a  complicated  and  time-consuming  process.  Furthermore  because
so  much  is  unknown  about  the  interaction  of  wildlife  with  the  various  technologies
being  developed  to  capture  ocean  and  hydrokinetic  energy,  special  effort  should  be
made  to  find  other  man-made  infrastructure  that  can  give  us  insights  into  the  po-
tential  impacts.  The  novelty  of  the  technologies  makes  post-installation  studies  of
impacts and adaptive management even more important.

Of  course  the  novelty  of  the  technologies  also  creates  understandable  concerns
from  project  developers  about  allowing  scientists  access  to  proprietary  information
regarding  system  design.  However,  these  concerns  should  not  be  allowed  to  hinder
pre-  and  post-installation  studies.  Access  for  independent  environmental  research
and development should be a prerequisite for any federal support.

The  idea  of  cumulative  impacts  takes  on  even  greater  importance  in  the  context
of ocean and hydrokinetic technologies. Not only should studies consider the impacts
associated with multiple projects, initially, they should develop an understanding of
the  cumulative  impacts  of  the  multiple  pieces  of  equipment  being  installed  within
the  bounds  of  one  project.  Utility  scale  projects  are  likely  to  require  more  than  one
hundred individual generators. In a river, lake, or in certain parts of the ocean, the
cumulative impacts of this many pieces of equipment could be dramatically different
than the impacts of just one or two generators.

The  only  exception  to  the  newness  of  this  family  of  technologies  is  offshore  wind
energy.  Given  the  more  mature  nature  of  this  technology  it  is  appropriate  that  off-
shore wind be generally not included in the Marine Renewable Energy Research and
Development Act of 2007. The only area where offshore wind should be explicitly in-
cluded is in lessons’ learned studies and studies that build baseline data on regions
with high ocean energy resources. Offshore wind energy projects could be an impor-
tant  source  of  information  about  energy  project  development  and  thus  should  be
considered  as  part  of  post-construction  studies  of  impacts.  Also  to  the  extent  that
regions  are  picked  due  to  their  having  high  resource  value,  the  environmental  ef-
fects  of  wind  power  should  be  considered  in  impact  studies,  as  wind  projects  could
contribute to the cumulative impacts concept described above.

Lastly, federal R&D should recognize the unique nature of our oceans, rivers, and
lakes.  They  provide  unique  ecosystem  services,  they  are  used  differently  than  land
from  both  a  commercial  and  recreational  perspective,  and  they  are  extremely  vul-
nerable  to  global  warming.  As  a  result  of  these  differences,  the  policies  and  proce-
dures  for  access  for  renewable  energy  projects  are  still  being  developed.  The  Min-
erals  Management  Service  has  taken  the  important  step  of  conducting  a  pro-
grammatic  environmental  impact  statement  on  its  offshore  energy  permitting  proc-
ess. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should work with state and federal
natural  resource  management  agencies  to  do  the  same  with  new  hydrokinetic  tech-
nologies.  On  land,  many  individual  states  and  some  collections  of  states,  which  are
anticipating  significant  wind  power  development,  have  taken  the  valuable  step  of
conducting  resource  mapping  to  identify  both  productive  sites  and  places  that
projects simply should not be developed. Ocean and hydrokinetic energy may be too
new  for  studies  to  offer  anything  other  than  preliminary  guidance,  but  that  is  an

important first step and only highlights the need to get started with environmental
impact R&D now.
Recommendations

• Focus federal R&D dollars on studies of a few regions with high resource po-
tential,  study  other  manmade  installations  in  oceans,  rivers,  and  lakes  in
order  to  anticipate  impacts  of  ocean  and  hydrokinetic  technologies,  and
prioritize post-installation lessons’ learned studies.

• Require access for independent pre- and post-installation environmental stud-

ies as part of eligibility for any federal subsidies.

• Ensure  that  studies  address  the  cumulative  impact  of  multiple  projects  and

of multiple installations within one project.

• Exclude  offshore  wind  from  the  Marine  Renewable  Energy  Research  and  De-
velopment  Act  of  2007  except  to  study  offshore  wind  projects  to  learn  lessons
that  may  inform  other  projects  and  as  part  of  regional  cumulative  impact
analyses.

• FERC  should  work  with  State  and  federal  natural  resource  management
agencies to do a programmatic environmental impact statement for the licens-
ing of new hydrokinetic technologies.

• Regional studies should help build consensus around areas that are best suit-
ed  for  early  development  and  those  that  should  be  avoided  at  least  until  the
potential impacts of the technologies are much better understood.

DISCUSSION

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you for your explanation.

PAST FUNDING CUTS TO GEOTHERMAL ENERGY RESEARCH

At  this  point  we  will  start  the  first  round  of  questions,  and  the
Chairman  will  recognize  himself  for  five  minutes.  I  want  to  start
with Dr. Tester and Mr. Thomsen.

The  Administration,  through  the  Office  of  Management  and
Budget,  has  attempted  to  justify  terminating  DOE’s  geothermal
technology  program  by  saying  research  supported  by 
the
geotechnology  program  has  contributed  to  reduced  costs  of  geo-
thermal power to the point that it is now a mature technology. Can
you  respond  to  that  statement,  both  of  you,  and  is  geothermal
power a ‘‘mature technology’’?

Dr.  TESTER.  Let  me  try  to  begin.  In  this,  I  think  it  is  necessary
to  separate  substance  from  semantics  in  the  OMB  decision.  I  have
been  having  a  lot  of  trouble  understanding  their  rationale  for  the
decision  that  they  made  in  calling  geothermal  technology  mature.
If  I  assume  that  they  are  thinking  of  geothermal  as  a  single  tech-
nology,  then  I  think  they  are  flawed  in  their  analysis.  Geothermal
is  a  resource.  Like  other  mineral  resources  such  as  oil  and  gas,  it
has  a  variety  of  grades  and  there  is  always  room  and  important
room  for  improvement.  As  we  just  heard  this  morning  and  I  think
we  pointed  out  in  our  assessment,  we  are  using  such  a  small  frac-

tion  of  the  available  geothermal  resource  right  now  that  it  would
be—can hardly be regarded as a mature technology.

Mr.  THOMSEN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  add  to  that.  The
first  point  I  would  like  to  add  or  make  is  that  we  have  never  seen
an  analysis  for  that  recommendation,  that  this  technology  has  be-
come  mature.  Being  unable  to  define  what  mature  is,  it  makes  it
a  bit  of  an  ambiguous  mark  to  find  and  describe.  I  would  like  to
echo  what  Dr.  Tester  said  and  say  that  geothermal  is  a  resource.
It  is  utilized  and  captured  by  a  suite  of  technologies  and  we  have
hydrothermal  technologies  which  are  slightly  more  mature,  we
have technologies like EGS that haven’t been commercialized. H.R.
2304  looks  at  specifically  those  heat-capturing  technologies  that
haven’t been commercialized and are not mature and says what we
can  do  to  better  capture  this  resource,  and  so  I  think  if  I  were  to
come to the defense of OMB I would say that they mischaracterized
geothermal as a single technology and not a resource and we need
to  do  everything  we  can  to  utilize  all  of  the  technologies  in  our
suite to capture this great domestic resource.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thanks.

GEO-PRESSURED RESOURCES

Dr.  Tester,  can  you  please  describe  geo-pressured  resources  and
their potential? I understand they are particularly prevalent in my
corner  of  the  world,  the  Gulf  Coast  of  Texas.  Should  this  geo-
thermal  legislation  contain  a  provision  to  specifically  address  that
resource?

Mr.  TESTER.  Geo-pressured  resources  are,  as  you  have  pointed
out, largely in the Gulf Coast area of the United States. They have
three  features  to  them  that  make  them  attractive:  high  tempera-
tures,  the  presence  of  dissolved  methane  and  also  relatively  high
pressures.  I  would  classify  them  in  this  continuum  of  geothermal
resources  as  we  have  talked  about  from  today’s  very  high-grade
systems that we utilize in the West that are liquid- or vapor-domi-
nated  systems  across  the  full  spectrum  to  very  low-grade  systems
in  the  East.  So  geo-pressured  is  in  there.  There  are  others  as  well
that  also  would  be  relevant  to  discuss  today  including  co-produced
fluids and things like that. Whether they should be explicitly point-
ed  out  in  the  bill  I  think  is  a  matter  for  consideration  but  if  the
bill  is  written  generally  enough,  and  I  think  it  is  now,  they  would
be considered part of that continuum, in my view.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you.

U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND OCEAN POWER

TECHNOLOGIES

Dr. von Jouanne, is the Corps of Engineers involved at all in any

of your research?

Dr.  VON JOUANNE.  The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  is  key  in
the regulatory process and so we have filed permits for ocean dem-
onstration  with  the  Corps  as  well  as  with  our  Oregon  Department
of  State  Lands  and  Department  of  State  Lands  and  Conservation
Development and the Ocean Coastal Zone Management, so——

have  on  so  much  of  what  is  happening  on  our  coastline,  it  seems
to  me  that  that  would  be  something  that  they  would  be  interested
in.

Dr.  VON JOUANNE.  Absolutely,  and  I  think  that  will  come.  You
know,  with  them  now  being  an  integral  part  of  that  permitting
process,  I  think  they  will  see  the  opportunities  that  they  would
have  to  contribute  because  there  are  a  lot  of  other  research  issues
that  need  to  be  looked  at,  such  as  sand  transport,  when  wave  en-
ergy  devices  are  deployed,  and  that  is  another  big  area  that  the
Corps of Engineers could provide input on.

H.R. 2313 RECOMMENDATIONS

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Mr.  O’Neill,  since  you  strongly  advocate  for
increased federal research and development funding for marine re-
newable  energy  technologies,  may  I  infer  that  you  support  H.R.
2313,  and  are  there  specific  changes  to  the  legislation  that  you
would recommend?

Mr.  O’NEILL.  Well,  in  terms  of  the  bill  itself,  we  support  the  bill
absolutely  and  we  support  all  efforts  in  this  area.  Any  specific
changes—we  actually  worked  with  staff  on  the  bill  a  bit  and  they
were very receptive. There are so many technologies. Mr. Thomsen
mentioned the suite of technologies within geothermal. We have got
a  lot  of  technologies  and  the  newer  emerging,  like  the  vortex-in-
duced  vibrations,  et  cetera,  aren’t  covered.  I  would  encourage  this
particular  committee  going  forward  that  developing  ways  to  really
foster  innovation—right  now  the  regulatory  process  as  Mr.  Greene
mentioned, we should have an adaptive management program and
we  wholeheartedly  endorse  something  like  that.  On  the  R&D  side
of it though, I think that Congresswoman Hooley’s bill is great.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
The Chair now recognizes Ranking Member Mr. Inglis.
Mr. INGLIS. I thank the Chair.

GEOTHERMAL GENERATING CAPACITY

Dr.  Tester,  you  testified  I  believe  that  100,000  megawatts  is

available from geothermal. Is that correct?

Dr.  TESTER.  Well,  let  me  clarify  my  remarks.  When  we  started
our  assessment,  we  undertook  the  idea  that  in  order  to  have  geo-
thermal be an important player in the United States, that it would
have  to  get  to  a  point  where  it  would  be  roughly  10  percent  of  the
generating  capacity  that  we  have  now.  That  would  correspond  to,
in  today’s  figures,  100,000  megawatts.  However,  if  you  look  care-
fully  at  the  analysis  that  we  made  of  the  regional  U.S.  resource,
including  Alaska  and  Hawaii,  but  just  looking  at  it  state  by  state,
we  are  really  talking  about  an  enormously  large  stored  amount  of
thermal  energy,  and  if  you  were  to  envision  a  future  where  you
might want to develop it beyond this 10 percent level, there would
not  be  an  issue  with  having  enough  energy  in  place  to  do  it,  and
although  geothermal  is  clearly  different  than  other  renewables
such  as  solar  and  wind,  the  sustainability  of  it  is  clear,  given  the
massive  amount  of  stored  thermal  energy  that  we  have  access  to
at,  let  us  say,  to  depths  from  the  surface  to  30,000  feet  or  to  10
kilometers.  And  I  think  it  is  important  to  keep  this  in  mind,  that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:09 Feb 01, 2008 Jkt 035236 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051707\35236 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

75

the  heat-mining  idea  has  to  be  modular  and  scaleable  so  you  start
out  small  and  you  develop  these  connected  reservoir  systems  in
much  the  way  that  you  would  want  to  emulate  what  nature  has
given  us  in  other  parts  of  the  world  where  we  utilize  geothermal
today, but it will never be limited, and I think we make this state-
ment  clear  in  the  report,  by  the  acceptability  or  the  magnitude  of
the  resource.  It  is  clearly  going  to  be  technology  and  economics
which  will  determine  how  much  of  this  we  can  utilize.  So  it  could
way  beyond  100,000  megawatts,  to  finalize  that,  if  you  wanted  to
go  to  that  regime,  but  it  will  be  a  matter  of  technology  and  cost.

LOCATIONS FOR GEOTHERMAL ENERGY PRODUCTION

Mr.  INGLIS.  Generally  speaking,  where  is  it  available  in  the

United States? What are the best locations?

Dr.  TESTER.  Well,  if  you  use  one  metric  as  best,  which  would  be
the  average  gradient,  the  geothermal  gradient,  you  could  largely
think of the western part of the United States as having the high-
est  gradients  in  general.  I  am  speaking  almost  from  west  of  the
Mississippi all the way to the California coast. What makes it spe-
cial  though  is  that  there  are  other  ingredients  that  you  want  be-
sides  just  high  temperature  and  shallow  depths.  In  the  conven-
tional  system,  you  are  looking  for  permeability  and  porosity,
connectivity,  if  you  will,  and  the  presence  of  fluids.  In  the  case  of
EGS,  we  are  missing  one  of  those,  and  we  are  trying  to  develop
technologies  that  would  stimulate  the  system  to  a  point  where  we
could  emulate  these  hydrothermal  conditions.  So  if  you  wanted  to
envision  a  program  as  we  tried  to  put  it  together  in  our  thinking
that  this  would  start  out  something  where  you  would  work  from
the  western  part  of  the  United  States  where  the  resources  are  of
higher  grade,  shallower,  less  costly  to  develop  and  to  demonstrate,
and then move east, so reversing the migration we had to the coun-
try. So the high-grade resources I would say would be generally the
western part but they are in Texas, they are in Colorado, they are
in  Montana.  They  are  equally  through  the  Pacific  Northwest  and
in  California,  not  just  where  we  are  producing  geothermal  energy
right now.

GEOTHERMAL TECHNOLOGY READINESS

Mr.  INGLIS.  The  Chairman’s  helpful  question  about  the  OMB’s
statement  that  it  is  a  mature  technology,  could  they  really  be  say-
ing  that  it  is  economics  that  will  make  this  work?  In  other  words,
the technology is there——

Dr. TESTER. Well, I think——
Mr. INGLIS.—it is just a matter of economics?
Dr.  TESTER.—eventually  everything  in  the  alternative  energy
field  gets  down  to  a  question  of  economics  but  I  think  what  they
seem  to  be  missing  is  that  this  is  not  just  one  number  fits  all  geo-
thermal  systems.  Very  high-grade  systems  such  as  we  have  in
parts  of  California  and  Nevada  and  Utah  are  already  producing
commercially  competitive  power  right  now.  What  we  would  like  to
do  is  to  improve  the  technology  to  the  point  through  this  vigorous
R&D  program  where  we  would  bring  down  those  costs,  where  we
would  reduce  risks  and  encourage  investment  so  that  we  could

bring  a  larger  portion  of  it  online.  So  if  you  will,  go  to  the  lower
grades, not necessarily what we might want to do in the very east-
ern  part  of  the  country  where  the  gradients  are  very  near  normal
but  certainly  to  open  up  the  west  soon  for  a  massive  development
of geothermal expansion.

Mr. INGLIS. Mr. Thomsen.
Mr.  THOMSEN.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Mr.  Inglis,  you  know,  I  think
your  question  is  a  very  good  one  in  the  fact  that  my  company  fo-
cuses on your typical hydrothermal applications, and those applica-
tions  have  been  prevalent  in  the  western  United  States  due  to  the
drilling  depth  and  cost  and  economics  of  those  projects.  What  this
bill  is  looking  at  and  what  Mr.  Greene  touched  on  is  the  fact  that
if we can make these technologies more efficient, we can go capture
this geothermal throughout the country, and I think when we look
at this, if we say what we have now is good enough, then the idea
of  maturity  can  be  acceptable.  My  company  doesn’t  feel  that  that
is the case. We want to continue moving eastward, going to greater
depths  and,  you  know,  to  break  it  down  to  its  most  simple  point,
if  we  can  become  more  efficient  and  reduce  the  risk  in  drilling  by
10  percent,  20  percent,  you  will  see  companies  like  ORMAT  and
other start-up companies going after these resources that might be
slightly deeper, harder to penetrate and go find. When we drill for
geothermal  resources  in  our  standard  hydrothermal  applications,
we  are  drilling  through  the  most—the  hardest  rock,  the  hottest
temperatures  and  looking  for  these  resources  that  are  difficult  to
find. We have done that well on the West Coast due to geology and
the  thickness  of  the  Earth’s  crust  and  things.  We  know  the  re-
sources  eastward  and  that  is  what  we  are  looking  to  find.  The
100,000-megawatt number that we talked about was from a report
done  in  1979.  We  haven’t  had  a  new  report  since  that  time.  And
at  that  time  they  were  looking  for  temperatures  in  standard  geo-
thermal applications that were well above 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
Technology  has  come  a  little  ways  in  being  able  to  capture  lower
temperatures  and  turn  that  into  viable  technology  projects.  We
want to continue looking at that throughout the country.

Mr. INGLIS. Mr. Chairman, time must be up, isn’t it? Thank you.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Inglis,  and  I  apologize  for
our clocks not working at all. If you will glance my way every now
and  then,  when  you  hit  five  minutes,  or  four  and  a  half  minutes,
I  will  at  least  hold  this  thing  up  and  if  you  get  to  five  I  will  start
tapping it a little bit.

I would recognize Mr. McNerney now for five minutes.
Mr. MCNERNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  do  want  to  thank  Dr.  Tester  for  the  excellent  detail  and  com-
prehensive  report  that  was  produced  and  for  the  executive  sum-
mary  that  was  actually  readable,  and  Mr.  Thomsen  for  your  fine
work with ORMAT.

GEOTHERMAL GENERATING CAPACITY

Dr. Tester, you mentioned that there were three gigawatts being
produced  now  and  that  we  have  a  potential  for  100  gigawatts  in
10 years. Is that what I understood you to say?

Dr.  TESTER.  If  we  proceed  on  the  path  that  we  proposed  in  our
scenario,  the  path  was  to  get  to  100,000  megawatts  in  50  years  to

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:09 Feb 01, 2008 Jkt 035236 PO 00000 Frm 00080 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051707\35236 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

77

take us from where we are now. So three gigawatts now to 100,000
megawatts in 50 years or 100 gigawatts, that is still quite an ambi-
tious  set  of  developments.  Each  geothermal  site  would  have  to  be
identified  and  developed,  exploratory  drilling  and  verification,  so
we  are  already  a  few  years  into  that,  as  you  know.  But  after  you
get  to  that  point,  particularly  as  you  get  out  along  the  10-  to  15-
year period, we feel that this will be essentially self-sustaining be-
cause  you  will  have  enough  of  these  modular  plants  in  place,  you
will  have  worked  on  both  ends  of  the  continuum,  as  I  call  it,  im-
proving  the  high-grade  and  hydrothermal  technologies,  and  using
where you can those technologies to work on EGS, and so our feel-
ing was that the economic analysis would say that a lot of learning
would  go  on  during  that  period,  demonstration,  multiple  dem-
onstrations,  improving  the  modularity,  being  able  to  show  we  can
do it not only in California but in Idaho or further east if we want-
ed  to  demonstrate  the  ability  to  make  reservoirs  and  stimulate
them.  So  I  am  encouraged  that  you  have  to  get  on  that  path  and
what  I  think  is  particularly  laudable  about  this  bill  is  that  it  real-
izes  that  you  can’t  just  stay  with  the  short-term  aspect  of  geo-
thermal. You really should be investing in both simultaneously and
I think it is very balanced with respect to that.

Mr. MCNERNEY. Thank you.

GEOTHERMAL’S IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY

Mr. Thomsen, you represent industry and I am very intrigued by
your  comment  about  jobs  and  the  impact  on  the  economy.  Of
course,  we  are  all  worried  about  global  warming  and  our  depend-
ence  on  oil  and  the  peak  oil  and  so  on  but  the  actual  impact  on
the economy is where it really is going to come—that is where the
pedal is going to hit the metal. For some fixed quantity of electrical
production, how does job creation compare both in the construction
part  and  in  the  production  part  to  oil  or  natural  gas,  which  is  our
leading form of electrical production today?

Mr.  THOMSEN.  Mr.  McNerney,  geothermal  production  is  an  in-
credibly  capital-intensive  project  up  front.  My  company  recognizes
that for each megawatt of energy we bring online, it requires a cap-
ital  investment  of  ours  of  $3  million,  so  if  we  bring  on  100
megawatts,  that  is  a  $300  million  investment.  When  we  go  to  con-
struct a project, 40 percent of our construction costs come from the
local economy. We utilize local contractors for the small electric mo-
tors  and  things  we  use.  We  contract  all  that  out  to  the  local  econ-
omy. So we have a very large impact. When it comes to jobs during
the construction phase, I think the Geothermal Energy Association
(GEA)  can  better  speak  to  those  exact  numbers  but  I  believe  it  is
approximately 10 to one in the amount of jobs required during the
construction  phase  compared  to  combined  cycle  gas,  but  we  can  be
sure  to  get  you  those  numbers.  And  the  point  that  we  would  like
to  point  out  there  is  because  this  is  a  domestic  resource,  that
money  stays  within  the  state  that  our  project  is  being  built  and
within this country, and that is hugely important for us.

rect.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  You  said  $3  million  per  megawatt.  Do  you  see

that number going down?

Mr.  THOMSEN.  Three  million  dollars  per  megawatt.  That  is  cor-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:09 Feb 01, 2008 Jkt 035236 PO 00000 Frm 00081 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051707\35236 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

78

Mr. MCNERNEY. Do you see that number going down as the tech-
nology  improves?  I  mean,  it  seems  like  when  you  go  to  EGS  you
are going deeper, you are going to have to do reservoir stimulation,
rock stimulation and so on, so it doesn’t seem like it is going to go
down with time.

Mr.  THOMSEN.  It  is—you  have  asked  kind  of  a  twofold  question
and  I  would  like  to  answer  that.  As  we  look—if  we  use  the  tech-
nology  that  we  are  currently  using  today  to  look  for  harder,  more
difficult  resources  at  greater  depth,  that  cost  will  not  go  down.  If
we  go  to  look  for  that  resource  using  the  same  drilling  techniques,
the  same  efficiency  and  production  techniques  that  we  use  today,
you  are  absolutely  correct.  If  we  can  make  the  technology  on  the
surface,  this  suite  of  technologies  that  can  take  that  heat  and
produce electricity more efficiently, that cost might come down. But
without  a  robust  R&D  budget  and  the  use  of  our  great  men  and
women  at  our  national  laboratories  and  universities  to  develop
that,  I  think  you  are  absolutely  right.  We  don’t  foresee  the  cost  of
that coming down greatly any time soon.

Dr.  TESTER.  I  could  make  one  other  small  addendum  to  that.  In
our analysis, if you look at the supply curves that we developed in
there,  you  will  see  that  the  early  development  of  EGS,  which  is
what  Paul  was  referring  to,  would  be  much  higher  cost.  It  would
be  somewhere  in  the  vicinity  of  perhaps  twice  the  current  energy
cost  we  have  now  for  electricity.  But  as  you  move  out  this  yearly
development and get out to the point where you have incorporated
technology  improvements,  learning  by  drilling  and  improving  the
drilling  technology,  our  estimates  would  be  that  after  about  12  to
15  years  you  would  reach  this  break-even  condition  where  EGS,
which requires these additional attributes, as you have mentioned,
would  be  competitive.  But  you  can’t  just  assume  that  will  happen.
I think it really takes engagement now in terms of getting the dem-
onstrations out there.

Mr. MCNERNEY. Thank you.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. McNerney.
The Chair now recognizes Mr. Diaz-Balart.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  have

two brief questions.

NOT IN MY BACKYARD (NIMBY) AND COST CONCERNS FOR

RENEWABLES

One  is  to  Mr.  O’Neill.  You  mentioned  the  cost  per  kilowatt-hour
for wind and wave and tidal, and just for, you know, laypeople like
us, for comparison sake, how does that compare to the cost of kilo-
watt-hour  for  electricity  from,  you  know,  coal,  natural  gas  and  nu-
clear, which is what we currently have, number one.

For  Mr.  Greene,  this  weekend,  by  the  way—last  weekend  I  was
at  the  NOAA’s  Southeast  Fishery  Science  Center,  which  is  located
in  Miami,  and  I  think  some  of  the  research  that  you  recommend,
for  example,  understanding  fish  populations,  would  probably  be
more  appropriately  performed  by  an  agency  like  NOAA  that  is
doing that right now, rather than DOE. Now, my understanding is
that  currently  these  bills  include  only  the  Department  of  Energy.
Don’t  you  believe  that  adequately  incorporating—would  it  not  be

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:09 Feb 01, 2008 Jkt 035236 PO 00000 Frm 00082 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051707\35236 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

79

better to expand to other agencies like NOAA and others who may
be doing it and not just limiting it to DOE?

And  lastly,  I  don’t  know  who  this  question  is  to,  Mr.  Chairman,
but  we  saw  last  year  a  very  good  example  of  NIMBY,  Not  In  My
BackYard,  in  the  Northeast.  I  am  not  going  to  mention  who  or
what but, you know, people who are seen as real forceful advocates
of  renewable  energy,  when  it  blocked  their  nice  view  of  the  ocean,
all said, you know, damn these resources, you know, we don’t need
them  in  front  of  my  yard,  in  front  of  my  view,  in  this  case.  It  was
just because it was blocking the view a few miles out in the ocean.
Have  you  all  looked  at  that  and  figured  out  how  to  deal  with  that
because,  you  know,  when  the  rubber  meets  the  road  and  reality  is
that, you know, this is all great but nobody wants it in their back-
yard  or  in  this  case,  in  the  front  of  their  ocean  view,  and  I  don’t
know,  it  is  not  really  a  question.  It  is  kind  of  just  throwing  out
there and you all have a thought about that.

So  Mr.  Chairman,  those  three  questions  and  I  will  shut  up.

Thank you, sir.

Mr.  O’NEILL.  If  I  can  start  with  your  last  question  first  because
I  have  spent  over  20  years  studying  the  NIMBY  phenomenon  and
worked  for  U.S.  generating  companies  siting  plants  in  17  different
states  where  we  ran  into  NIMBYism  in  all  its  many  forms.  Very
often  NIMBYism  comes  from  not  a  real  substantive  issue  with  a
plant.  You  can  be  in  a  community  for  a  year  and  have  the  town
fathers  telling  you  boy,  this  is  the  best  thing  since  sliced  bread.
Then  it  is  time  to  pull  papers  and  run  for  office  and  you  are  the
only  issue  in  town.  Very  oftentimes  NIMBYism  comes  from  dis-
enfranchisement,  and  with  projects  like  ocean  energy  projects  or
even  traditional  power  projects,  the  important  way  to  approach  a
project, any kind of very large-scale change is going to scare people,
so  what  you  need  to  do  is,  you  need  to  go  in,  you  need  to  talk  to
the  environmental  community,  you  need  to  talk  to  the  NRDC,  you
need  to  talk  to  the  Sierra  Club,  you  need  to  talk  to  the  local  folks
and  you  need  to  listen  to  them,  having  a  two-way  dialog.  In  some
cases  project  developers  have  actually  made  changes  in  the  design
of their projects, say, changed the coal train coming into a town to
using  a  barge  to  bring  coal  in  so  that  people  don’t  have  the  same
kind of impacts that the train would have. So making a change, ac-
tually  listening  to  the  people  in  the  community.  There  have  been
lots  of  wonderful  changes  made  to  traditional  power  plants.  In
Florida they found that agricultural nutrients were going into Lake
Okeechobee.  The  project  developer  built  a  29-mile  pipeline  around
the lake and took those nutrients, used them in their process water
instead of letting the nutrients go in. They got that information by
working with the local community and the county. So reaching out
and  dealing  with  stakeholders  early  in  the  process  is  the  answer
to your first question. Sorry for such a long answer.

To  your  first  question  in  terms  of  the  cost,  traditionally,  to  be
competitive,  you  want  to  be  about  three  to  four  cents  a  kilowatt-
hour.  The  cost  to  the  consumer  is  actually  about  eight-plus  cents.
I  think  it  is  8.6  cents  a  kilowatt-hour  and  that—excuse  me?  Oh,
yeah,  and  it  varies  from  region  to  region.  But  that  includes  the
transmission  and  distribution  costs  that  the  utilities  incur,  et
cetera.  When  you  look  at  a  32-cent-per-kilowatt-hour  feed-in  tariff

in  Portugal  compared  to  our  1.9,  that  1.9  is  probably  appropriate
right now for wind because of the scale that we have onshore wind
projects.  That  brings  them  right  into  the  hunt  to  be  commercial.
With ocean technologies, as I mentioned, the offshore wind was 40
cents a kilowatt-hour when it started. We are down getting into the
single digits already right out of the box.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much. Your time is expired

and I turn now and recognize Ms. Giffords for five minutes.

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Mr.  Chairman,  because  I  know  we  are  going  to
have votes called in just about five minutes, five, ten minutes actu-
ally, I was hoping to hear from the sponsor of the bill.

Chairman LAMPSON. You may yield to her if you care to.
Ms. GIFFORDS. I would yield to Representative Hooley.
Ms. HOOLEY. Thank you very much for yielding.

WAVE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY READINESS

Dr.  von  Jouanne,  talk  to  me  a  little  bit  about  with  wave  energy
where  we  are  compared  to  some  of  the  other  renewable  energy
sources.

Dr.  VON JOUANNE.  Very  good.  In  wave  energy,  we  are  about  20
years behind wind energy and that is because we have just started
to  see  dollars  invested  in  wave  energy  and  what  we  saw  in  wind
energy is that those investment dollars enabled an acceleration to-
ward the optimum topology that we see now. We see this horizontal
axis three-blade turbine. What we are seeing in wave energy right
now  is  several  topologies  being  considered  in  very  preliminary
stages  of  development  and  so  while  companies  are  planning  to  de-
ploy  and  preparing  to  deploy  their  first  topologies,  a  great  deal  of
research and development still needs to take place in order to real-
ly optimize those topologies to make them cost competitive, and be-
cause  of  the  advantages  of  wave  energy  over  other  forms  of  strong
renewables  such  as  wind  and  solar,  we  really  feel  that  the  catch-
up  time  can  be  accelerated  with  the  proper  research  and  develop-
ment  dollars  invested,  and  that  the  cost  can  be  very  competitive
with other strong technologies such as wind, and, as I emphasized,
we  have  this  issue  of  energy  density.  If  we  look  at  the  density  of
water  compared  to  air,  the  density  of  water  is  about  832  times
greater,  which  means  we  can  extract  more  power  from  a  smaller
volume  at  subsequent  lower  costs  and  smaller  visual  impact  with
the  whole  NIMBY  issue  being  critical.  We  also  have  greater  avail-
ability, that is, how often are the waves rolling, and we have great-
er  predictability  that  enables  a  utility  to  determine  how  much
power  a  wave  park  equivalent  to  a  wind  farm,  a  wave  park  would
be putting onto the grid, so some substantial advantages there.

Ms.  HOOLEY.  Mr.  O’Neill,  at  what  point  do  you  think  that  wave
energy in some form would be available for to be used in this coun-
try,  and  what  happens  if  we  don’t  have  the  research  and  develop-
ment dollars available?

Mr.  O’NEILL.  Well,  if  you  look  at  Alaska  right  now  where  they
are paying up to 80 cents a kilowatt-hour for diesel-generated elec-
tricity,  we  could  go  commercial  and  be  profitable  in  Alaska  right
now.  The  problem  is  that  we  don’t  have  projects  in  the  water.  We
need  to  have  actual  operating  projects.  We  need  to  embrace  the
concept of adaptive management so that we are looking at the envi-

ronmental effects as well as the efficiencies of these technologies to
improve them. So getting them in the water—and Dr. von Jouanne
accurately  portrayed  the  fact  that  wave  technology  is  about  20
years behind wind but I see us ramping up to commercial viability
within  the  next  five  to  eight  years,  and  maybe  even  sooner.  Ad-
vances  not  only  in  wind  technology  but  in  composite  materials  de-
sign,  looking  at  other  offshore  construction  techniques,  our  compa-
nies—if  you  look  at  Verdant  Power,  which  has  six  turbines  in  the
East  River  of  New  York,  they  have  been  operating.  They  have  got
$2  million  of  sonar  equipment  to  watch  the  fish  and  the  fish  are
swimming around the turbines. They are not running into the tur-
bines, just as expected. But the tips of the turbine blades go around
slowly  just  like  with  wind  turbines,  because  of  the  lessons  from
Altamont  Pass.  We  use  a  monopole,  another  lesson  from  Altamont
Pass. We are learning from—so it is like the technology cycle time
in  computers  where  it  used  to  be  a  new  computer  would  come  out
every two or three years, then it was every year and now it is every
six  months  and  three  months.  You  can’t  buy  a  cell  phone  now  and
think that is going to be new and sexy for more than three months,
and  that  is  what  is  happening.  It  is  a  robust,  vibrant  area  and  we
are going to get there.

Ms. HOOLEY. Thank you.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  thank  the  gentlelady,  and  now  we  recog-

nize Mr. Bartlett for five minutes—Dr. Bartlett.

SOLAR AUGMENTED GEOTHERMAL ENERGY (SAGE)

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Thank  you  very  much.  My  wife  suggests  that  a
better acronym for those who are opposed to development that they
are a BANANA, Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone.
That is where some of our people are coming from. I wonder if Dr.
Tester  or  others  might  comment  on  a  concept  called  SAGE,  which
is  Solar  Augmented  Geothermal  Energy.  One  of  the  big  problems
of course with solar and wind is that they are intermittent and you
have  got  to  store  the  energy  and  they  have  what  I  think  is  a  very
clever approach to doing that. They are using the excess energy at
the  moment  of  production  to  heat  brine,  which  is  then  pumped
down into exhausted oil fields. Using all the techniques you use in
geothermal,  they  are  then  extracting  the  energy  from  that  hot
brine.  But  a  side  benefit  from  this  is  that  they  are  loosening  up
some  of  the  oil  that  is  there  and  we  are  now  able  to  pump  addi-
tional oil from these fields. We would just like your observation on
the utility of SAGE as a potential for being a bridge between fossil
and renewable energy.

Dr.  TESTER.  Let  me  comment  first.  I  am  sure  Mr.  Thomsen  will
want  to  add  something  to  it.  One  good  thing  about  geothermal  is
that it is continuous, dispatchable power, having very high capacity
factors  that  are  typically  now  in  excess  of  90  percent  in  terms  of
their availability capacity factor. So to go to a hybrid concept would
take—using solar would take some redesign and rethinking of how
you would handle the power conversion end of it but certainly could
be done. There are good examples of this across the spectrum of re-
newables  in  general  where  we  are  dealing  with  interruptible  re-
newables  with  respect  to  solar.  If  we  look  at  the  Kramer  Junction
plant  in  California  where  it  uses  gas  when  the  sun  is  not  shining,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:09 Feb 01, 2008 Jkt 035236 PO 00000 Frm 00085 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051707\35236 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

82

that  is  a  hybrid  concept  as  well.  So  I  would  be  very  positive  about
considering all ways in which you could utilize a higher fraction of
renewable  resources  if  it  made  sense  technically  and  economically.
The  idea  of  injecting  hot  water  and  increasing  production  of  fluids
is  something  that  we  address  sort  of  in  the  inverse  way,  namely
that  through  the  production  of  oil  and  gas  we  also  produce  a  lot
of  hot  water,  warm  water  just  as  a  consequence  of  that,  and  that
water,  at  least  the  thermal  energy  content  goes  largely  unutilized.
This  is  what  is  referred  to  as  co-produced  fluids,  and  I  think  that
too  could  increase  the  effectiveness  or  efficiency  of  a  utilization  ef-
fort. So all of the things you are suggesting I think are appropriate
to  be  examined  and  analyzed.  I  don’t  think  there  are  any  picking
winners  and  losers  at  this  stage.  It  is  perhaps  a  little  premature.
Mr. THOMSEN. If I could, Mr. Chairman to Mr. Bartlett, you have
touched  on  some  very  good  points,  one  being  is  the  bridging  of  re-
newable  to  fossil  fuels.  I  think  the  SAGE  idea  that  you  proposed
is  great  and  I  think  we  should  look  at  it.  We  are  also  looking  at,
like  Dr.  Tester  said,  the  co-production  of  hot  water  from  existing
oil  and  gas  wells  which  research  has  shown  to  us  might  increase
the  longevity  of  our  existing  oil  fields.  We  also  have  technology
very  similar  to  geothermal,  which  captures  waste  heat  from  gas
compression  stations  using  the  exact  same  geothermal  technology
and  producing  additional  electricity  with  no  new  emissions.  The
solar  concept  has  been  used.  ORMAT  was  responsible  for  a  test
project  in  Arizona  using  solar  troughs  that  heated  a  working  oil,
kind of a solar trough collecting the sun’s heat centered on a work-
ing  oil  that  we  pumped  through  our  system  and  produced  elec-
tricity.  So  the  idea  there  is  a  fantastic  one.  What  all  of  those
projects  have  in  common  is  they  can  all  be  added  to  the  suite  of
technologies  for  geothermal  and  renewables  but  none  of  those  yet
are  commercially  viable,  and  that  is  what  we  think  this  bill,  2304,
will help us do, take all that science and technology that isn’t quite
yet  commercially  viable  and  help  us  learn  from  that  so  we  can
make  it  commercially  viable,  bring  down  those  cost  points,  look  at
the problems with interfacing a geothermal power plant with a well
with  a  solar—you  know,  solar  field,  et  cetera.  So  I  think—I  mean,
that is a fantastic suggestion.

GEOTHERMAL ENERGY TRANSPORTATION

Mr. BARTLETT. If we can do this of course we have another chal-
lenge and that is how to get the energy from the site of production
to  the  user.  With  oil,  it  is  easy.  You  put  it  in  a  pipe.  You  put  a
gallon  in  the  pipe;  1,000  miles  away  you  still  got  a  gallon.  What
we are producing with electricity we put on a wire and 1,000 miles
away  you  may  have  nothing.  So  we  have  the  challenge  of  how  we
get  the  energy  that  we  produce  to  the  ultimate  user  because  most
of these abandoned fields are not near big population densities.

Mr. THOMSEN. And one of the interesting and great attributes of
geothermal energy is its ancillary services, and because it is a base-
load energy source, when we produce electricity—I am not an elec-
trician  and  I  am  sure  someone  on  the  panel  can  probably  explain
it  to  you  better.  We  can  actually  change  the  oscillation  of  that  en-
ergy  from  AC  current  to  DC  current,  so  when  we  put  it  on  a  line,
we can actually change the characteristics of that electricity so that

83

it  can  go  farther  and  farther  away.  Some  of  our  power  plants  in
Nevada  are  hundreds  of  miles  away  from  the  residential  base.  We
are  close  to  transmission  but  far  away  from  that  residential  base
and  we  can  actually  change  the  characteristics  so  that  we  can  get
more power there.

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Bartlett.
I will now recognize Ms. Woolsey for five minutes.
GEOTHERMAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT

Ms. WOOLSEY. Hello, and just outside of my district, Santa Rosa,
California,  we  have  some  of  the  largest  reserves  of  geothermal  en-
ergy  in  the  entire  country,  and  to  make  this  renewable  energy
source  even  more  renewable,  Santa  Rosa,  which  is  the  largest  city
in my district, pumps wastewater up the geysers to keep them gen-
erating electricity for a large part of Santa Rosa. So it is a wonder-
ful  partnership  and  Santa  Rosa  does  away  with  a  lot  of  their
wastewater while they receive electricity.

What  I  want  to  know  is,  are  the  current  production  tax  credits
adequate  to  stimulate  exploration  and  development,  and  I  also
want  to  know,  are  there  any  offsetting  problems  with  the  natural
resources that need to be mitigated or do we come up ‘‘A+’’ because
we are actually helping the environment while we do this?

Mr.  THOMSEN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  to  Ms.  Woolsey.  Re-
garding  the  production  tax  credit,  the  geothermal  industry  was
thrilled  to  finally  be  included  in  the  production  tax  credit.  The
problem  we  have  with  the  production  tax  credit  is  that  it  only
tends  to  be  renewed  every  two  to  four  years.  The  average  geo-
thermal  project  takes  three  to  five  years  to  come  online  from  a
Greenfield  project,  and  so  we  are  really  asking  the  industry  some-
times to take a very short market signal from the government and
make  a  20-,  30-year  commitment  because  that  is  how  long  our
power  plants  operate.  When  it  comes  to  getting  financial  institu-
tions  to  help  you  with  the  huge  upfront  capital  costs,  the  produc-
tion  tax  credit,  its  amount  is  great  but  its  length  is  not  so  great
and  we  have  been  unable  to  make  good  use  of  that.  There  have
been  two  projects  that  have  qualified  for  the  production  tax  credit
since  it  was  passed.  They  happen  to  both  be  ORMAT  projects  and
the  projects  were  started  long  before  we  knew  the  production  tax
credit  was  going  to  be  there.  We  just  happened  to  kind  of  fall  into
that later on and so what we are looking for and what would really
help  industry  is  a  credible  commitment  for  a  longer  period  of  time
so  that  we  knew  when  we  went  to  investors  and  we  went  to  the
banks to say we are going to have this tax credit when this project
comes  online.  Without  that,  it  hasn’t  been  that  beneficial  to  the
geothermal  industry  as  of  yet.  The  second  part  of  your  question  I
think Dr. Tester can answer.

GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE ASSESSMENT

Dr.  TESTER.  Thank  you  for  pointing  out  that  lovely  example  of
what  goes  on  at  the  geyser  field.  In  fact,  you  are  doing  what  we
would want to do in normal geothermal practice, which is to contin-
ually  reinject  and  resupply  the  system  so  you  can  more  effectively

mine  heat,  and  you  might  note  in  our  assessment  of  the  enhanced
geothermal system side of the story that we did talk about the need
and recommended that resource assessment in general needs to be
looked  at  much  more  quantitatively  and  in  a  much  more  specific
way  across  the  country.  The  last  time  a  serious  study  was  done
was  almost  30  years  ago  right  now,  a  published  study  by  the  U.S.
Geologic Survey. The bill addresses that but I think the importance
of  that  and  how  that  will  affect  where  you  go  to  the  next  genera-
tion of sites is incredibly important. We picked a few targets of op-
portunity,  as  we  called  them,  in  our  study,  one  of  which  was  the
Clear  Lake  area  right  near  the  geyser  site.  That  has  been  well
characterized  and  obviously  is  a  high-grade  area  but  there  are
many others in the country that haven’t had that degree of drilling
and exploration that also need to be looked at in California as well
as many other states. So this is a good part of the bill and I think
needs to be sustained. It is something that I think nationally is im-
portant for us to do. Thank you.

ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM GEOTHERMAL

Mr. GREENE. Congresswoman, I think, without a doubt, that geo-
thermal  can  play  a  large  role  in  a  very  environmentally  positive
way.  Every  energy  technology  though  has  some  environmental  im-
pact  and  I  think  the  important  thing  that  I  talked  about  earlier  is
thinking  about  this  technology  in  a  long-term  way.  We  need  to  go
from one, two, three projects to having lots of these projects if they
are  going  to  contribute  in  a  large  way.  That  means  we  need  to
think  about  their  impacts  cumulatively  over  all  of  those  projects.
I think to do that, that is an environmental challenge and issue in
and of itself. The other part of getting there is addressing the sort
of uncertainty that communities feel when a project comes to them
and they are trying to figure out, all right, well, what does this geo-
thermal  project  in  our  backyard  mean,  and  so  getting  consensus
around what the real environmental impacts are going to be is crit-
ical and I think the research and development that we are talking
about  here  today  can  play  a  huge  role  in  building  that  consensus.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Ms. Woolsey.
I  want  to  thank  this  panel.  I  think  that  we  can  adjourn  at  this
point in time. We have had everyone who wanted to ask questions,
and  I  have  a  few  more  questions  but  we  will  do  that  differently.
I  really  appreciate  all  of  you  for  appearing  before  the  Sub-
committee.  We  all  do.  Your  testimony  has  been  very  helpful  and  I
think  fascinating.  I  believe  that  the  legislation  that  we  have  dis-
cussed  today  moves  us  forward  in  our  effort  to  develop  a  more  di-
verse supply of energy.

Under  the  rules  of  our  committee,  the  record  will  be  held  open
for  two  weeks  for  Members  to  submit  additional  statements  and
any  additional  questions,  as  I  have,  that  they  might  have  for  the
witnesses.

Thank you all for coming. This hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:25 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Jefferson  Tester,  Meissner  Professor  of  Chemical  Engineering,  Massa-

chusetts Institute of Technology

Questions submitted by Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. What is the smallest scale plant for electric power conversion that is both techno-
logically  feasible  and  also  makes  commercial  sense?  What  is  the  largest?  How
modular or centralized can geothermal energy production be?

A1. About  one  to  two  MWe  would  be  the  smallest  output  for  geothermal  electric
plant  that  would  be  practical  today.  There  have  been  smaller  ones  in  operation  in
the  past  by  they  have  been  mostly  demonstrations  and  not  in  commercial  service.
For  non-electric  applications  such  as  geothermal  heat  pumps  much  smaller  outputs
(e.g.,  5–10  kW  thermal)  are  commercially  feasible  today.  Economies  of  scale  are
reached for single modular generating plants supplied by one set of production wells
somewhere  in  the  50  to  100  MWe  range.  These  modules  can  be  linked  together  to
provide central station generation capacity to meet demands for large load centers—
such  as  mega  cities  or  densely  populated  regions.  A  good  example  of  this  approach
is  The  Geysers  field  in  Northern  California  near  Santa  Rosa  which  is  the  largest
geothermal plant in operation in the world. It actually has a nameplate capacity in
excess  of  2,000  MWe  and  consists  of  many  modular  plants  in  the  size  range  of  50
to 100 MWe.
Q2. Can you please comment on workforce training issues relevant to geothermal en-
ergy  development.  Is  our  country  currently  producing  technically  competent
workers in sufficient numbers to significantly expand work in all aspects of geo-
thermal development?

A2. Our  country  is  not  currently  producing  enough  engineers  and  scientists  with
specific  geothermal  knowledge  to  develop  and  deploy  geothermal  technologies  at  a
much increased rate. Fortunately in the U.S., student interest in alternative energy
careers  is  growing  and  we  have  the  capacity  in  our  universities  in  engineering  and
Earth sciences to teach most of the core skills and fundamentals needed. With a na-
tional R&D program in place it would not take much to redirect colleges and univer-
sities to actively engage in creating programs to educate and train the next genera-
tion of scientists and engineers needed for large scale geothermal energy system de-
ployment  and  operation.  It  would  be  good  to  involve  students  and  faculty  with  ac-
tual operating geothermal plants and field demonstrations by way of internships or
co-ops when possible.
Q3. Can  individual  geothermal  reservoirs  be  depleted  of  heat  or  fluid  over  time?  If
so,  how  long  does  a  reservoir  last?  If  the  heat  in  a  reservoir  can  be  depleted,
can it be recharged by allowing it to lie ‘‘fallow’’ for a period of time? How long?
Must the power plant on the surface lie dormant during this time, or can it tap
into other reservoirs?

A3. As  thermal  energy  or  heat  is  mined  from  specific  reservoirs  they  are  ‘‘locally’’
depleted  or  cooled.  An  important  feature  is  that  the  extent  of  the  depletion  is  very
limited—well within the active reservoir dimensions as only a portion of a rock vol-
ume near the injection wells would be cooled. Furthermore, in contrast to other min-
eral  or  fossil  resources,  once  a  particular  geothermal  reservoir  ceases  to  operate  it
will  ‘‘regenerate’’  on  its  own  with  heat  being  conducted  from  hotter  regions  of  rock
that  surround  the  cooled  parts  and  by  energy  being  generated  by  radiogenic  decay
of contained minerals. After a period of roughly two to four times the energy extrac-
tion period rock temperatures will be restored to their initial condition. In a typical
commercial  operation  any  depleted  wells  could  be  redrilled  or  re-stimulated  or  re-
placed  with  new  wells  to  restore  fluid  production  temperatures.  The  power  plant
would  continue  to  operate  with  high  availability  and  capacity  factors  using  the
newly drilled, re-drilled or restimulated wells as their source of energy.
Q4. Given the enormous potential for geothermal energy development that you high-
light  in  the  MIT  report,  how  do  you  explain  the  relative  lack  of  interest  in  this
resource? Why hasn’t it attracted more attention in recent years?

A4. There  are  several  reasons  why  I  feel  the  potential  of  geothermal  energy  has
been  grossly  undervalued  in  the  U.S.  (1)  The  ‘‘constituency’’  of  advocated  for  geo-
thermal  energy  is  much  smaller  than  for  other  renewables  such  as  solar  and  wind
that compete for resources and funds within the DOE. (2) There is widespread per-
ception that geothermal is ‘‘too small and too localized’’ resource with only a few re-

gions capable of providing power. This perception is based on the idea that only nat-
ural  high-grade  hydrothermal  systems  are  viable,  it  completely  ignores  the  idea  of
EGS—with  human  intervention  to  engineer  systems  to  emulate  the  properties  of
high-grade  hydrothermal  reservoirs.  (3)  Federal  R&D  for  geothermal  has  been  in-
consistent and to small for the last 15 years in the U.S. to mount sufficiently large
field demonstrations of EGS technology.
Q5. What  other  countries  are  supporting  EGS  research  and  what  are  they  doing?

Have they made any significant advances?

A5. There  are  several  EGS  programs  underway  at  the  present  time  in  Europe  and
Australia. The largest of these are at the Cooper Basin site in South Australia oper-
ated by Geodynamics with federal, State and private support and the Soultz site in
France  operated  with  the  EU  R&D  program  and  at  the  Landau  site  in  Germany,
and  the  Basel  site  in  Switzerland  under  private  and  federal  sponsorship.  Each  of
these tests has advanced EGS technology building on earlier U.S. experience.
Q6. In  your  written  testimony  you  comment  on  the  importance  of  international  co-
operation  in  geothermal  R&D.  Can  you  comment  on  what  a  specific  provision
to  support  such  international  cooperation  might  look  like?  What  specific  activi-
ties should it support, and with whom?

A6. Provisions for extended international travel support for our scientists and engi-
neers to participate in ongoing field testing and evaluation of EGS systems in other
countries would provide significant leveraging of our own efforts and avoid duplica-
tion.  Also  in  some  cases,  it  may  be  appropriate  to  have  jointly  funded  research
projects  particularly  on  technique  or  instrumentation  development  for  evaluating
reservoirs and for drilling. To start, we should be collaborating with the Australians,
with the Europeans involved in projects at the Soultz, Landau, and Basel sites, with
the  Italians  at  sites  in  northern  Italy  and  elsewhere,  and  with  the  Icelandic  re-
searchers  dealing  with  geothermal  developments  in  Iceland  and  in  other  countries.

Responses  by  Paul  A.  Thomsen,  Public  Policy  Manager,  ORMAT  Technologies,  Inc.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. What is the smallest scale plant for electric power conversion that is both techno-
logically  feasible  and  also  makes  commercial  sense?  What  is  the  largest?  How
modular or centralized can geothermal energy production be?

A1. ORMAT  recognizes  that  there  are  many  technologies  that  can  be  used  to  com-
mercially  convert  typical  hydrothermal  resources  into  electricity.  ORMAT  utilizes
the  ORMAT  ENERGY  CONVERTER  (‘‘OEC  ’’),  a  power  generation  unit,  which
converts  low,  medium  and  high  temperature  heat  into  electrical  energy,  and  there-
fore can only comment on this technology utilized by ORMAT.

The  OECs  are  designed  for  the  specific  conditions  of  a  wide  variety  of  heat
sources.  Its  main  components  include  a  vaporizer/preheater,  turbo-generator,  air-
cooled  or  water-cooled  condenser,  feed  pump  and  controls.  The  OEC  is  a  field-prov-
en,  mature  commercial  product  used  in  71  countries  worldwide.  ORMAT  has  suc-
cessfully  manufactured  and  supplied  more  than  800  MW  of  geothermal  power
plants,  based  on  its  proprietary  technology,  logging  millions  of  hours  of  operating
experience.

The  OEC  enables  geothermal  developers  to  efficiently  and  economically  use  the
full range of naturally occurring geothermal resources found throughout the world—
from low temperature geothermal water to high-pressure steam.

• Full Range of Geothermal Conditions:

– The  OECs  can  accommodate  a  wide  range  of  geothermal  fluid  tempera-

tures and chemistries:

– Steam pressure: from 1.5 bar (21.8 psig) up to 25.0 bar (362 psig)
– Brine temperature: from 100°C to 224°C
– Silica content: up to 1.95 silica index
– NCG content: up to 15 percent

• Full Range of Site Specific Plant Scale:

– Available  in  sizes  and  configurations  cost-effectively  matched  to  specific
resource  and  project  requirement,  rather  than  imposing  standardized
plant sizes
• Capacity range:

– from 250 kW to 130 MW

• Enabling  100  percent  re-injection  of  the  geothermal  fluid  serves  to  maintain

reservoir pressure and sustain the life of the aquifer.

• Air-Condensers for Sustainability and Environmental Benefits

– In  addition  of  enabling  100  percent  re-injection,  air-cooled  condensers
minimize the environmentally negative impact of emissions and acid rain
from  cooling  towers  and  eliminate  the  use  of  chemicals  for  water  treat-
ment

• High Availability

– ORMAT binary cycle plants have demonstrated average plant availability
of over 97 percent, with typical individual OECs demonstrating generally
over 95 percent availability

• Modularity:

– The modular approach leads to flexibility, high average plant availability,
faster  delivery  time  and  the  capability  of  incremental  development  of
projects

• Incremental Development:

– Use of the modular concept and cost-effective plants at modest capacities
makes it feasible to develop projects in an incremental manner, which is
a more economically viable and a less risky approach

• Repowering Existing Plants:

– The  use  of  OECs  for  re  powering  existing  power  plants  produces  more

power without additional resources by:

• Utilizing  excess  inlet  steam  pressure  through  unique  ‘‘topping’’  tur-

bines

• Utilizing unused heat of brine discharged from a separator

• Small/Medium Scale Projects:

– OEC  technology  is  also  commercially  applicable  for  small-scale  projects
where  the  resources  are  limited,  the  power  demand  small  and/or  where
the conventional technology is not economically viable

– The  OEC’s  high  reliability,  pre-assembled  units,  ease  of  operation  and
maintenance,  and  convenience  in  transportation  and  installation  are  ex-
panding the use of small scale projects

Q2. Can you please comment on workforce training issues relevant to geothermal en-
ergy  development?  Is  our  country  currently  producing  technically  competent
workers in sufficient numbers to significantly expand work in all aspects of geo-
thermal development?

A2. Currently, ORMAT sees a lack of engineers and personnel with applicable voca-
tional skills in this county. With the expanded growth of the industry coupled with
a lack of confidence in the continuation of DOE funding the geothermal industry is
bracing for a substantial dearth of qualified and interested individuals.

In the GEA’s Handbook on the Externalities, Employment, and Economics of Geo-
thermal Energy Alyssa Kagel points out that a geothermal power plant provides sig-
nificantly more jobs than a comparative natural gas fired power plant, according to
the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE).1 Geothermal  jobs  are  quality,  long-term,  and  di-
verse. According to the Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Re-
port  (EIS/EIR)  for  the  proposed  Telephone  Flat  geothermal  development  project  lo-
cated  in  the  Glass  Mountain  Known  Geothermal  Resource  Area  (KGRA)  in  Cali-
fornia,  the  average  wage  at  the  facility  will  be  more  than  double  the  average  wage
in  the  surrounding  counties.  GEA’s  employment  survey  found  that  the  over-
whelming majority of geothermal jobs (95 percent) are permanent, and most are also
full-time.  In  2004  the  geothermal  industry  supplied  about  4,583  direct  power  plant
related jobs.

The total direct, indirect, and induced employment impact of the industry in 2004
was 11,460 full-time jobs.2 Looking to the future, geothermal employment should ex-
pand  significantly.  In  2005  alone,  GEA  has  verified  over  2,000  MW  of  geothermal
projects  under  development,  which  would  increase  geothermal  capacity,  and  subse-
quently geothermal employment, by over 70 percent. Within the next ten years, the
Western Governors’ Association (WGA) estimates that over 5,600 MW could be pro-
duced  in  eleven  U.S.  states,  the  economic  effect  of  which  is  detailed  in  the  table
below.

Q3. Can  individual  geothermal  reservoirs  be  depleted  of  heat  or  fluid  over  time?  If
so,  how  long  does  a  reservoir  last?  If  the  heat  in  a  reservoir  can  be  depleted,
can it be recharged by allowing it to lie ‘‘fallow’’ for a period of time? How long?
Must the power plant on the surface lie dormant during this time, or can it tap
into other reservoirs.

A3. The geothermal reservoir is the entire system of fractured and permeable rocks
and  the  hot  water  or  steam  trapped  in  that  volume  of  rock.  Geothermal  reservoir
engineering is the application of the basic principles of physics and chemistry to the
engineering problems associated with the production of hot water (‘‘brine’) or steam
from permeable rocks within the Earth. The rock contains most of the heat energy,
but  the  brine  or  steam  is  necessary  to  carry  the  thermal  energy  to  the  surface  for
economic use. The long term success and profitability of an electricity producing geo-
thermal  project  depends  on  how  well  the  geothermal  resource  is  managed.  Like  oil

and  gas  reservoirs,  geothermal  reservoirs  can  be  overproduced  if  not  properly  man-
aged.  Overproduction  of  a  reservoir  leads  to  a  significant  shortening  of  its  produc-
tive  lifetime  and  a  loss  of  income.  Almost  all  geothermal  fields  require  injection  of
the  produced  brine  back  into  the  reservoir  to  maintain  pressure  and  productivity.
ORMAT’s closed loop binary process re-injects 100 percent of all brine used in its
process  creating  a  preferable  reservoir  management  program,  allowing  ORMAT  to
predict future changes in pressure, temperature, production rates, and chemistry of
the produced geothermal fluids.

Such  information  is  crucial  for  designing  power  plants  and  other  facilities  re-
quired  for  the  most  economic  use  of  the  resource.  Reservoir  engineering  is  of  major
importance  in  geothermal  development.  Any  unexpected  change  in  the  characteris-
tics  of  the  wells  or  produced  fluids  can  dramatically  affect  the  profitability  of  the
project. The application of reservoir engineering begins during the exploration phase
of the project with the analysis of the initial geophysical measurement data that in-
dicates a promising geothermal system, and it continues throughout the operational
life of the geothermal resource. It is the reservoir engineer’s task to test wells, mon-
itor  their  output,  design  new  wells,  and  predict  the  long-term  performance  of  the
reservoir  and  wells.  This  design  and  prediction  is  accomplished  by  studying  field
and  operational  measurement  data  and  using  computer  models  to  project  the  field
operation into the future. During operation of a geothermal field, the reservoir engi-
neer  will  be  able  to  compare  the  actual  performance  to  the  predicted  performance.
If necessary, the engineer can modify the management plan for the geothermal field
to  obtain  more  efficient  operation.  ORMAT’s  steamboat  facility  has  been  operating
since 1985 with minimal variation to the resource temperature. Because 90 percent
of  the  heat  utilized  in  the  geothermal  process  is  transferred  from  the  surrounding
rock  to  the  brine,  ORMAT  is  unaware  of  any  geothermal  reservoir  that  has  com-
pletely  depleted  its  heat  source.  While  water  management  can  be  difficult  in  non-
closed  loop  systems,  EGS  systems  may  prove  pivotal  in  assisting  in  reservoir  man-
agement.
Q4. Does  your  company  see  major  export  opportunities  for  geothermal  energy  tech-

nologies?

A4. Yes,  ORMAT  is  a  vertically-integrated  company  whose  primary  business  is  to
develop, build, own and operate geothermal and recovered energy power plants uti-
lizing in-house designed and manufactured equipment selling the electricity to utili-
ties  under  long-term  power  purchase  agreement.  Power  generation  resulted  in  73
percent of 2006 total revenues.

ORMAT  also  supplies  its  power  generating  equipment  or  complete  power  plants
on  a  turnkey—EPC  (Engineering,  Procurement  and  Construction)  basis  to  devel-
opers, utilities and industrial users. ORMAT has installed its equipment in 71 coun-
tries on six continents. Products resulted in 27 percent of 2006 revenues.
Q5. What are the specific technological hurdles that stand in the way or geothermal

power being used as a significant source of energy in the United States?

A5. ORMAT  sees  technological  hurdles  and  substantial  needs  for  improvement  in
technology, resource information, and efficiencies for which federal research is vital.
The  range  of  near-term  needs  is  broad.  Our  knowledge  and  understanding  of  the
geothermal  resource  base  is  limited  and  largely  outdated.  The  technology  available
today to identify and characterize the resource often does not mitigate the high risk
of  development.  Drilling  in  harsh  geothermal  environments  is  difficult  and  expen-
sive.  In  locations  where  the  resource  cannot  presently  support  commercial  produc-
tion, we need to evaluate the applicability of EGS techniques to achieve power gen-
eration at competitive prices.

ORMAT  supports  a  continued  geothermal  research  program  to  address  these
near-term  needs  to  expand  domestic  energy  production  and  the  long-term  need  to
find the additional breakthroughs in technology that could revolutionize geothermal
power  production  and  reduce  this  countries  dependence  on  foreign  energy  sources.
ORMAT  believes  this  to  include  an  ongoing  R&D  program  focused  on  further  ex-
panding  the  hydrothermal  resource  base,  developing  the  technologies  needed  to
make the EGS concept commercially viable, and taking advantage of the substantial
deep  thermal  resources  associated  with  the  petroleum  formations  along  the  Gulf
Coast.

ORMAT  believes  cost-sharing  is  an  appropriate  and  necessary  component  of  a
near-market partnership between the government and a for profit entity. For an ex-
ample  of  what  can  come  from  this  type  of  collaboration  I  turn  to  the  fact  that
ORMAT  has  signed  a  cost-shared  Cooperative  Research  and  Development  Agree-
ment  (CRADA)  with  DOE  to  validate  the  feasibility  of  a  proven  technology  already
used in geothermal and Recovered Energy Generation (REG).

The  project  will  be  conducted  at  the  DOE  Rocky  Mountain  Oil  Test  Center
(RMOTC),  near  Casper,  Wyoming,  and  will  use  an  ORMAT  Organic  Rankine  Cycle
(ORC) power generation system to produce commercial electricity. ORMAT will sup-
ply  the  ORC  power  unit  at  its  own  expense  while  the  DOE  will  install  and  operate
the  facility  for  a  12-month  period.  ORMAT  and  the  DOE  will  share  the  total  cost
of the test and the study, with ORMAT bearing approximately two thirds of the less
than  $1M  total  investment.  The  information  gathered  from  this  project  may  have
implications to the some 8,000 similar type wells have been identified in Texas.

Questions submitted by Representative Gabrielle Giffords
Q1. Can  you  comment  on  the  use  of  water  resources  in  geothermal  power  plants?  Is
a  source  of  water  essential,  either  for  cooling  or  other  purposes?  Is  geothermal
technology  applicable  in  regions,  like  the  southwestern  U.S.,  where  water  is
scarce?

A1. Water  use:  Water  cooling  is  not  always  required  for  geothermal  power  plants.
Binary  power  plants  (which  will  be  the  most  commonly  installed  for  most  new  geo-
thermal  facilities)  can  be  air-cooled.  However,  in  locations  with  high  average  ambi-
ent  temperatures,  water-cooling  is  a  preferred  method,  even  for  binary  plants.  The
water-use  for  these  power  plants  is  relatively  low  compared  to  fossil  fuel  tech-
nologies.

According  to  the  Geothermal  Energy  Association,  ‘‘Geothermal  plants*  use  five
gallons of freshwater per megawatt hour, while binary air-cooled plants use no fresh
water.  This  compares  with  361  gallons  per  megawatt  hour  used  by  natural  gas  fa-
cilities.’’ 3

* This includes binary plants and flash or steam plants.
Because geothermal plants use significantly less water than fossil fuel plants, the
scarcity of water is not a concern, nor a obstacle to development. Geothermal plants
currently  operate  in  the  Southwest  in  Southern  California,  Central  Nevada,  and
Southwestern  Utah.  A  geothermal  power  plant  has  operated  in  Southwestern  New
Mexico.

Outside  of  Southern  California,  and  Central  and  Northern  Nevada,  other  areas
in  the  Southwest  have  been  noted  as  containing  geothermal  prospects  sufficient  for
electric production.
This includes areas in Arizona (including Southeastern Arizona)
This  includes  areas  in  Colorado  (particularly  Southwestern/South  central  Colorado)
This  includes  areas  in  New  Mexico  (particularly  Southwestern/South  central  New
Mexico)

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF

H.R. 2304, THE ADVANCED GEOTHERMAL ENERGY

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007

REP. JERRY MCNERNEY (D–CA)

INTRODUCED MAY 14, 2007

Summary

H.R. 2304 directs the Secretary of Energy to support programs of research, devel-
opment, demonstration, and commercial application in advanced geothermal energy
technologies. It also establishes or expands several programs for technology transfer
and information sharing on geothermal energy.
Section-by-Section
Section 1. Short Title

Act  may  be  cited  as  the  ‘‘Advanced  Geothermal  Energy  Research  and  Develop-

ment Act of 2007’’
Section 2. Findings

Geothermal  energy  is  a  renewable  resource  capable  of  providing  baseload  power
generation  (and  other  applications)  with  minimal  environmental  impact.  The  geo-
thermal energy potential in the United States is widely distributed and vast in size,
yet it remains barely tapped. Sustained and expanded funding for research, develop-
ment, demonstration, and commercial application programs is needed to improve the
technologies to locate, characterize, and develop geothermal resources.

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF

H.R. 2313, THE MARINE RENEWABLE ENERGY
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007

REP. DARLENE HOOLEY (D–OR)

INTRODUCED MAY 15, 2007

Summary

H.R. 2313 directs the Secretary of Energy to support programs of research, devel-
opment,  demonstration,  and  commercial  application  in  marine  renewable  energy
technologies.  It  also  establishes  National  Centers  for  the  testing  of  marine  renew-
able energy technologies.
Section-by-Section
Section 1. Short Title

Act  may  be  cited  as  the  ‘‘Marine  Renewable  Energy  Research  and  Development

Act of 2007’’
Section 2. Findings

Marine energy sources—including waves, tidal flows, ocean currents, and thermal
gradients—are clean, renewable, domestic sources of energy that have the potential
to provide significant amounts of electricity to the Nation’s power grid. Technologies
designed to harness marine energy sources are already providing grid power in Eu-
rope. Recent studies have identified an abundance of viable sites for marine energy
production  in  coastal  areas  of  the  United  States,  but  expanded  R&D  is  necessary
to further develop the related technologies and hasten their commercial application.
Federal support can be instrumental in hastening the development of marine renew-
able energy technologies and reducing the risk of investing in these areas.
Section 3. Definitions

Provides  definitions  for  the  following  terms  used  in  the  Act:  ‘Marine  Renewable
Energy’ (includes usable energy derived from waves, tidal flows, ocean currents, and
thermal gradients), and ‘Secretary.’
Section. 4. Marine Renewable Energy Research and Development

Instructs the Secretary to support programs of research, development, demonstra-
tion, and commercial application of marine renewable energy technologies. Areas of
activity shall include: studying and comparing existing technologies, developing im-
proved  technologies,  reducing  costs  of  manufacture  and  operation,  investigating  in-
tegration  with  power  grid,  improving  wave  forecasting  technologies,  optimizing
placement  of  devices,  increasing  reliability  and  survivability,  studying  technology
compatibility  with  the  environment,  protocols  for  interacting  with  devices,  and  de-
veloping power measurement standards.
Section 5. Marine Renewable Energy Research and Demonstration Centers
Calls for the establishment of one or more Centers for the research, development,
and  demonstration  of  marine  renewable  technologies.  Such  centers  shall  serve  as
permanent  installations  in  environmentally  approved  areas  where  prototype  tech-
nologies  can  be  tested  in  connection  with  the  power  grid.  Centers  shall  also  serve
as clearinghouses of industry relevant information. Sites for Centers shall be chosen
on  the  basis  of  accessibility  to  appropriate  marine  energy  resources  and  proximity
to an existing marine renewable energy research and development program.
Section 6. Authorization of Appropriations

Authorizes appropriations of $50,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008 through

2012.

STATEMENT OF UTC POWER

UTC Power appreciates the opportunity to submit the following statement for the
record  for  the  House  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology,  Energy  and  Environ-
ment  Subcommittee  hearing  on  ‘‘Developing  Untapped  Potential:  Geothermal  and
Ocean Power Technologies.’’
Company Background

UTC Power, a business unit of United Technologies Corporation, is a world leader
in commercial stationary fuel cell development and deployment. UTC Power also de-
velops other innovative power systems for the distributed energy market. This docu-
ment  focuses  on  issues  related  to  the  latest  addition  to  our  portfolio  of  clean,  effi-
cient,  reliable  technology  solutions—namely,  PureCycle  power  system.  This  is  an
innovative  low-temperature  geothermal  energy  system  that  represents  the  first  use
of  geothermal  energy  for  power  production  in  the  State  of  Alaska  and  the  lowest
temperature geothermal resource ever used for commercial power production in the
world.  The  technology  currently  is  being  demonstrated  at  the  Chena  Hot  Springs
resort 60 miles from Fairbanks, Alaska and 35 miles off the power grid. UTC Power
recently  announced  an  agreement  with  Raser  Technologies  to  provide  up  to  135
PureCycle  geothermal  power  systems  totaling  approximately  30  megawatts  of  re-
newable power for three Raser power plants.
Summary

Geothermal  energy  addresses  many  of  our  national  concerns,  but  its  potential  is
largely  untapped.  UTC  Power’s  PureCycle  system  represents  an  innovative  ad-
vancement  in  geothermal  energy  production  and  is  operating  successfully  today  in
Alaska  as  part  of  a  demonstration  effort.  This  geothermal  energy  breakthrough  of-
fers the possibility of tapping into significant U.S. geothermal reserves for a domes-
tic,  renewable,  continuously  available  source  of  power  to  meet  our  growing  energy
demands. Congressional action is needed, however, if the United States is to trans-
late  this  potential  into  reality.  We  welcome  the  introduction  of  the  ‘‘Advanced  Geo-
thermal  Energy  Research  and  Development  Act  of  2007’’  (H.R.  2304)  as  a  key  ele-
ment  of  the  comprehensive  policy  framework  that  is  necessary  to  advance  our  na-
tion’s use of geothermal energy.
Geothermal  Energy  Addresses  Many  National  Concerns,  But  Huge  Poten-

tial is Largely Untapped

Our  nation  is  faced  with  air  quality  and  global  climate  change  challenges,  ever-
increasing fuel costs and a desire to be less dependent on energy sources from politi-
cally  unstable  areas  of  the  world.  The  United  States  is  blessed  with  an  abundance
of geothermal energy resources that offer a renewable, continuously available, large-
ly untapped domestic resource. The country generates 2,800 MWe of geothermal en-
ergy  for  power  production  in  California,  Nevada,  Utah  and  Hawaii  and  another
2,400 MWe is under development. While estimates vary, the Geothermal Energy As-
sociation indicates that with effective federal and State support, as much as 20 per-
cent  of  U.S.  power  needs  could  be  met  by  geothermal  energy  sources  by  2030.  The
National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory’s  report  ‘‘Geothermal:  The  Energy  Under
Our  Feet’’  concludes:  ‘‘Domestic  resources  are  equivalent  to  a  30,000-year  energy
supply  at  our  current  rate  for  the  United  States.’’  The  study  also  notes:  ‘‘New  low-
temperature  electric  generation  technology  may  greatly  expand  the  geothermal  re-
sources that can be developed economically today.’’
Chena Hot Springs Resort Puts Geothermal on the Map in Alaska

Thanks to a partnership between UTC Power, Chena Hot Springs Resort, the U.S.
Department  of  Energy,  Alaska  Energy  Authority,  Alaska  Industrial  Development
and  Export  Authority  and  the  Denali  Commission,  Alaska  was  added  last  year  to
the list of states using geothermal resources for power production. The system oper-
ates  on  165°F  (74°C)  geothermal  water  and  by  varying  the  refrigerant  can  use  hy-
drothermal  resources  up  to  300°F  (149°C).  This  is  an  exciting  breakthrough  since
previously  experts  had  assumed  that  geothermal  fluids  needed  to  be  at  least  225°F
(107°C) for economic power generation. It is also significant since a large portion of
the  estimated  known  U.S.  geothermal  resources  are  expected  to  be  in  the  low  to
moderate  temperature  range,  including  a  large  number  of  deposits  associated  with
oil  and  gas  wells  that  are  currently  not  economically  viable  and  therefore  non-pro-
ductive.
The system was commissioned in August 2006 and provides power for the resort’s
on-site electrical needs. Our two PureCycle 225 kW Chena units have logged 5,400
hours of experience with 98 percent availability.

The  visionary  owners  of  the  resort,  Bernie  and  Connie  Karl,  are  committed  to  a
sustainable  community  that  is  entirely  self-sufficient  in  terms  of  energy,  food  and
fuel.  Their  dedication  is  evidenced  by  on-site  renewable  power  sources  that  secure
their energy independence while benefiting the environment.

We  are  working  closely  with  Alaskan  authorities  regarding  further  development
of  and  enhancements  to  this  technology.  There  is  significant  potential  to  deploy
PureCycle  systems  for  biomass  applications  at  Alaska’s  more  than  200  rural  vil-
lages  that  currently  depend  on  diesel  generators  with  fuel  being  shipped  by  air  or
water.  The  present  approach  results  in  high  costs,  logistics  issues,  and  dirty,  loud
power generation that is inconsistent with native cultural values.
Description of PureCycle Technology

The  PureCycle  system  is  the  product  of  a  UTC  brainstorming  session  in  2000
focused  on  opportunities  for  organic  growth.  It  is  based  on  organic  Rankine  cycle
(ORC)  technology—a  closed  loop  process  that  in  this  case  uses  geothermal  water  to
generate 225 kW of electrical power. Think of an air conditioner that uses electricity
to  generate  cooling.  The  PureCycle  system  reverses  this  process  and  uses  heat  to
produce electricity. The system is driven by a simple evaporation process and is en-
tirely  enclosed,  which  means  it  produces  no  emissions.  The  only  byproduct  is  elec-
tricity, and the fuel—hot water—is a free renewable resource. In fact, after the heat
is  extracted  for  power,  the  water  is  returned  to  the  Earth  for  reheating,  resulting
in the ultimate recycling loop.
Innovative Features and Awards

The PureCycle  system reflects a number of key innovations and breakthroughs.
As  mentioned  previously,  the  Chena  project  is  the  world’s  lowest  temperature  geo-
thermal  resource  being  used  for  commercial  power  production  and  represents  the
first time geothermal energy has been used to produce electricity in Alaska.
On  the  technical  side,  the  PureCycle  system  capitalizes  on  an  advanced  aero-
dynamic design that results in 85 percent efficiency from a radial inflow turbine de-
rived  from  a  Carrier  Corp.  compressor.  Carrier  Corp.  is  a  sister  UTC  company  and
a world leader in air conditioning and refrigeration technology. The geothermal sys-
tem  is  also  unique  in  its  ability  to  match  the  turbine  design  to  working  fluid  prop-
erties,  thus  allowing  the  equipment  to  operate  on  a  range  of  low  to  moderate  tem-
perature  energy  resources  and  enhancing  its  flexibility  to  meet  customer  require-
ments.
While  the  PureCycle  system  and  its  application  to  the  geothermal  energy  mar-
ket  are  new,  the  product  draws  upon  decades  of  UTC  innovation,  operating  experi-
ence and real-world expertise. Key components of the system are derived from Car-
rier  Corp.  and  90  percent  of  the  PureCycle  system  is  based  on  UTC  high-volume,
off-the-shelf components that enhance the value proposition to our customers.

The  Chena  project  has  attracted  world-wide  attention  and  won  two  awards  in
2006—a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy 2006 Na-
tional  Green  Power  Award  for  on-site  generation  and  Power  Engineering  magazine
named it Renewable/Sustainable Energy Project of the Year.
What Is the Significance of Low Temperature Geothermal Energy?

Previously, geothermal energy for power production has been concentrated in only
four Western U.S. states. The ability to use small power units at lower temperature
geothermal  resources  will  make  distributed  generation  much  more  viable  in  many
different  regions  of  the  country.  Simply  put,  PureCycle  technology  could  result  in
significant  new  domestic,  continuously  available  renewable  energy  resources—not
just in Alaska, but across the country. The capability to operate with a low tempera-
ture resource allows the UTC PureCycle  System to utilize existing lower tempera-
ture wells and to bottom higher temperature geothermal flash plants and many ex-
isting ORC binary power plants.

In  addition,  there  are  more  than  500,000  oil  and  gas  wells  in  the  U.S.,  many  of
which  are  unprofitable.  The  use  of  geothermal  hot  water,  which  is  abundant  at
many oil and gas well sites, to produce a renewable source of electrical power could
extend  the  life  of  many  of  these  assets.  This  would  result  in  significant  environ-
mental,  energy  efficiency,  climate  change,  economic  and  other  benefits  associated
with the development of geothermal oil and gas electrical power.
Recommended Actions

It  is  unfortunate  that  at  this  moment  in  time  when  there  are  exciting  innovative
developments in the world of geothermal technology, the Federal Government is cut-
ting  off  research  and  development  funding.  The  rationale  given  is  that  the  tech-
nology  is  mature  and  represents  a  resource  with  limited  value  since  it  is  confined
to only a few Western states.

121

We have only scratched the surface regarding our nation’s geothermal energy po-
tential.  The  R&D  possibilities  have  not  been  exhausted  and  this  is  NOT  a  resource
that is limited to only a few Western states. There are advances in low-temperature
geothermal energy alone that prove otherwise.

The  National  Research  Council  report  ‘‘Renewable  Power  Pathways’’  recognized
the  importance  of  geothermal  energy  and  stated:  ‘‘In  light  of  the  significant  advan-
tages  of  geothermal  energy  as  a  resource  for  power  generation,  it  may  be  under-
valued in DOE’s renewable energy portfolio.’’

Government  action  is  needed  on  a  variety  of  fronts  to  fully  realize  the  potential

of our nation’s significant geothermal resources. UTC Power recommends:
1. Extension  of  the  geothermal  production  tax  credit  and  revised  ‘‘placed  in  service’’

rules.
The  2005  Energy  Policy  Act  made  geothermal  energy  production  eligible  for  the
Sec.  45  federal  Renewable  Electricity  Production  Tax  Credit  (PTC).  This  incen-
tive is adjusted for inflation and currently provides 2.0 cents per kWh for energy
produced  from  geothermal  resources.  A  taxpayer  may  claim  credit  for  the  10-
year  period  commencing  with  the  date  the  qualified  facility  is  placed  in  service.
Many geothermal projects take years to develop. The PTC timeframe is too short
for  most  geothermal  projects  to  be  completed  by  the  current  placed  in  service
deadline.  We  support  the  Geothermal  Energy  Association’s  position  that  ‘‘To
achieve sustained geothermal development, Congress should immediately amend
the law to allow facilities under construction by the placed in service date of the
law  to  qualify,  and  extend  the  placed  in  service  deadline  by  at  least  five  years,
to January 1, 2014, before its expiration.’’
Since our PureCycle system is just now entering the marketplace, we need cer-
tainty and stability with regard to this important incentive to maximize market
penetration  and  capitalize  on  the  many  societal  benefits  of  geothermal  power
production.

2. Robust funding for DOE’s Geothermal Research Program.

There  are  a  variety  of  geothermal  research,  development  and  demonstration
needs, including cost-shared partnerships to:
– enhance  the  performance  of  existing  successful  geothermal  power  production

systems;

– improve the efficiency of geothermal capture rates;
– increase the size of low temperature systems to one megawatt;
– develop systems that can operate at even lower temperatures than today; and
– demonstrate the benefits for other applications including the oil and gas mar-
ket  as  well  as  industrial  reciprocating  engines  (jacket  water  and  exhaust
heat).

3. Comprehensive nationwide geothermal resources assessment.

The most recent U.S. Geological Survey for geothermal energy was conducted in
1979.  This  survey  used  techniques  that  are  outdated  today  and  was  based  on
technology  available  30  years  ago.  It  did  not  consider  low  to  moderate  tempera-
ture resources since there was no technology available at the time that could uti-
lize these resources in a cost-effective manner.

4. Incentives for geothermal exploration and drilling.

According  to  the  Geothermal  Energy  Association,  90  percent  of  geothermal  re-
sources are hidden with no surface manifestations. Exploration is essential to ex-
pand production, but exploration is expensive and risky. Cost-shared support for
exploration and drilling should be continued and expanded.

Comments on H.R. 2304

We  applaud  the  leadership  of  Reps.  McNerney  (D–CA),  Gordon  (D–TN)  and
Lampson (D–TX) in introducing the ‘‘Advanced Geothermal Energy Research and De-
velopment Act of 2007’’ (H.R. 2304). This legislation addresses many of the pressing
research,  development,  demonstration  and  commercial  application  needs  related  to
geothermal  energy.  UTC  Power  offers  the  following  suggestions  to  clarify  the  Con-
gressional intent and enhance the legislation’s effectiveness.
Section 4—Hydrothermal Research and Development—As noted above, there are sig-
nificant  opportunities  for  research,  development  and  demonstration  activities  re-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:09 Feb 01, 2008 Jkt 035236 PO 00000 Frm 00125 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051707\35236 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

122

lated to low temperature geothermal power production. We recommend that a third
category of programs be included in this section that addresses the opportunities re-
lated  to  enhanced  performance,  higher  efficiency,  greater  size,  lower  temperature,
biomass, reciprocating engines (jacket water and exhaust heat), and oil and gas ap-
plications.

In  addition,  to  ensure  the  required  site  characterization  activities  include  exam-
ination of low, moderate and high temperature resources, language should be added
to make this explicit. As noted above, previous assessments have not focused on low
temperature geothermal resources based on the assumption that technology was not
available  to  economically  utilize  these  resources.  As  our  Chena  Alaska  project  has
demonstrated,  low  temperature  geothermal  resources  can  be  tapped  for  power  gen-
eration  and  therefore  it  is  essential  that  resource  assessments  include  information
on their location and key characteristics.
Section  8—Centers  for  Geothermal  Technology  Transfer—The  list  of  subjects  being
addressed  by  these  information  clearinghouses  should  be  expanded  to  include  ad-
vances  in  geothermal  power  production  technology  so  state  of  the  art  developments
can be disseminated to interested parties.
Section  10—Study  on  Advanced  Uses  of  Geothermal  Energy—H.R.  2304  calls  for  a
series of reports not later than one year, three years and five years after enactment
on  advanced  concepts  and  technologies  to  maximize  the  geothermal  resource  poten-
tial  of  the  United  States  including  the  co-production  of  geofluids  for  direct  use  or
electric  power  generation  in  conjunction  with  existing  oil  and  gas  extraction  oper-
ations. We believe the Nation could speed up its use of these strategically important
resources  by  beginning  a  demonstration  program  at  the  earliest  possible  date  to
validate  the  technology.  By  supporting  a  demonstration  effort  in  parallel  with  a
more  extensive  and  rigorous  examination  of  the  characteristics  of  these  sites  and
their  location,  we  could  expedite  the  technical  learning  process  and  accelerate  the
timeframe  in  which  we  could  maximize  the  many  benefits  of  these  resources.  UTC
Power  would  therefore  recommend  that  in  addition  to  the  study  mandated  in  Sec-
tion  10,  language  be  added  in  Section  4  authorizing  a  demonstration  program  for
co-production  of  geofluids  for  direct  use  or  electric  power  generation  in  conjunction
with existing oil and gas extraction operations.

Conclusion

As UTC Power’s Chena project demonstrates, far from being a mature technology
with limited geographic reach, geothermal energy has the potential to satisfy a sig-
nificant  portion  of  our  growing  energy  needs  with  a  renewable,  continuously  avail-
able  domestic  resource.  But  appropriate  government  policies  must  be  adopted  and
implemented to make this a reality. We welcome the opportunity to work with Mem-
bers of the Committee and other stakeholders to refine and enhance H.R. 2304 and
ensure its enactment and implementation as part of a comprehensive package of ini-
tiatives that support geothermal energy production.
