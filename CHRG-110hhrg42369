Background

The National Sea Grant College Program (Sea Grant) was established in 1966 by
the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  Act  (33  U.S.C.  § 1121–1131).  It  was  last
reauthorized in 2002. The Sea Grant Program is intended to be the marine, coastal,
and  Great  Lakes  counterpart  to  the  Land  Grant  College  system  which  serves  the
agricultural  research  and  extension  needs  of  each  state.  Each  of  the  32  Sea  Grant
programs works with the National Sea Grant office in the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration (NOAA) and the coastal community in their state or terri-
tory  to  develop  research  priorities  to  promote  sustainable  use  and  management  of
coastal  or  Great  Lakes  resources.  The  Sea  Grant  program  is  supported  through  a

combination of federal appropriations and through State appropriations and in-kind
contributions.

The  Sea  Grant  program  is  comprised  of  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric
Administration  (NOAA)  National  Sea  Grant  Office  (NSGO),  32  university-based
State  programs,  the  National  Sea  Grant  Review  Panel,  a  National  Law  Center,  a
National Sea Grant Library and hundreds of participating institutions.

The  Sea  Grant  network  addresses  key  issues  and  opportunities  in  areas  such  as
aquaculture,  aquatic  nuisance  species,  marine  biotechnology,  seafood  safety,  fish-
eries management, coastal business and development, coastal habitat, water quality,
and  coastal  hazards.  Sea  Grant  conducts  priority-driven  research,  transfers  sci-
entific  results  to  the  public,  provides  educational  opportunities  from  K–12  to  grad-
uate  degrees,  and  conducts  successful  outreach  programs.  Sea  Grant  is  a  partner-
ship  among  academia,  government,  and  the  private  sector  and  uses  a  combination
of research, education and outreach to improve management of the coastal, marine,
and Great Lakes environment.

The National Ocean Research Priorities Plan (ORPP)

The  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC)  established  a  Joint  Sub-
committee on Oceans in 2003. At the direction of the President’s Ocean Action Plan,
this  group  was  expanded  in  2005  to  include  Science  and  Technology  (JSOST).  The
JSOST reports to the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources in addition
to the Interagency Committee on Ocean Science and Resource Management Integra-
tion (ICOSRMI). JSOST developed the National Ocean Research Priorities Plan and
Implementation Strategy and released it in January 2007. The ORPP was designed
to  establish  priorities  for  ocean  science  and  technology  for  the  next  decade.  Using
this new interagency priorities plan for ocean science, the National Sea Grant Office
in  NOAA  and  the  Sea  Grant  colleges  nationwide  have  developed  a  new  strategic
plan that links Sea Grant’s priorities with the larger interagency effort.

The  ORPP  provides  guidance  on  how  the  various  ocean  science  sectors  (govern-
ment, academia, industry, and non-government entities) can and should be engaged,
individually or through partnerships, to address the areas of greatest research need
and  opportunity.  Given  the  magnitude  of  the  task,  the  report  established  priorities
at  a  relatively  high  level  and  the  implementation  strategies  were  not  detailed.  Of
specific  interest  to  Sea  Grant  is  that  one  of  the  actions  identified  in  the  Sub-
committee on Integrated Management of Ocean Resources’ (SIMOR) 2006 work plan
is  for  Sea  Grant’s  university  network  to  facilitate  the  development  of  Regional  Re-
search and Information Plans. These Regional Plans will outline one mechanism for
regional ORPP implementation and identify the top research and information prior-
ities.

National Academy of Sciences Evaluation

The National Sea Grant College Program Amendments Act of 2002 directed NOAA
to  contract  with  the  National  Research  Council  to  evaluate  Sea  Grant’s  process  of
reviewing  individual  programs  and  recommend  ways  to  improve  the  overall  effec-
tiveness of the evaluation process to ensure fairness, consistency, and enhancement
of performance. The National Academy of Sciences completed its review in 2006 and
issued its report, Evaluation of the Sea Grant Program Review Process.

The 2006 report recommended:

• strengthening the strategic planning process for the individual programs,
• increasing the interaction between the National Sea Grant Office and the in-
• improving  the  program  rating  and  ranking  process  through  annual  assess-

dividual programs, and

ments by the national office.

The  Report  commented  on  the  importance  of  improving  strategic  planning.  Some
individual Sea Grant programs have developed strategic plans that reflect active col-
laboration  with  the  National  Sea  Grant  Office  (NSGO)  as  well  as  its  local  constitu-
ents. However, other individual Sea Grant programs have been slow to develop stra-
tegic  plans  or  have  strategic  plans  that  are  poorly  designed,  poorly  integrated  with
the  national  strategic  plan,  or  lack  specificity  for  addressing  local  and  regional
needs.

The peer review and assessment process of the Sea Grant program evolved signifi-
cantly  since  its  inception.  The  National  Academy  Report  discusses  the  evolution  of
the evaluation process and makes recommendations to bring balance to the process
with regards to appropriately directed competition and development of a robust na-
tional program whose foundation is the network of local programs created and main-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:59 Sep 29, 2008 Jkt 042369 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E08\052108\42369 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

5

tained  by  individual  Sea  Grant  colleges  and  institutions  and  administered  by  the
NSGO.

The  NAS  report  suggests  there  should  be  a  balance  in  the  assessment  process
with  regard  to  producing  improvement  in  the  individual  Sea  Grant  programs  while
also  encouraging  its  strengths.  The  panel  questions  the  benchmarks  used  in  the
evaluations  and  whether  they  are  sufficiently  ambitious.  If  the  benchmarks  are  de-
signed  to  reflect  annually  updated,  quantitative  measures  of  the  significance  and
impact of research, outreach, and education activities, it would be easier to contrast
program performance relative to other programs and to the program’s past perform-
ance.  The  report  also  states  that  the  evaluation  criteria  currently  used  do  not  ade-
quately  emphasize  the  importance  of  network  building  among  individual  programs
and  how  such  activities  help  to  link  the  local  and  regional  efforts  into  an  effective
nationwide program.

Some  aspects  of  the  current  program  evaluation  process  and  ranking  appear  to
have  fostered  an  increase  in  competition  and  lowered  the  level  of  cooperation  be-
tween individual Sea Grant programs. The Academy panel concluded that this tend-
ency was not consistent with efforts to build a cooperative nationwide effort.1

Changes to the Sea Grant Program in H.R. 5618

H.R. 5618 reauthorizes the National Sea Grant College Program and amends sev-
eral sections of the law including sections related to the interaction between the Na-
tional Sea Grant Office and the individual programs; programmatic performance re-
views;  and  strategic  planning.  A  number  of  the  changes  are  technical  or  clarifying
in nature or alter specific cost-sharing or cost allocation formulas. A Section-by-Sec-
tion of the bill is included below.

The Findings are amended by including reference to the National Ocean Research
Priorities Plan and pointing to the Sea Grant program as the most appropriate pro-
gram for carrying out the priorities listed in the Plan.

The  bill  would  amend  the  law  by  adding  two  new  definitions.  The  first  is  a  ‘‘re-
gional research and information plan’’ which expands Sea Grant’s role to include re-
gional  and  national  projects  conducted  by  two  or  more  Sea  Grant  institutions.  The
second  is  the  ‘‘National  Ocean  Research  Priorities  Plan  and  Implementation  Strat-
egy’’ which is a plan issued by the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Tech-
nology (JSOST).

In  the  2002  authorization,  our  committee  amended  the  Sea  Grant  review  process
to require the Director to evaluate each Sea Grant institute’s performance and then
to place the institutes into one of five categories based on their performance rating.
This ranking was then to be used as the basis for allocating funding among the in-
stitutes with the best performing being rewarded with any increased appropriations
made  available.  H.R.  5618  repeals  this  provision.  The  Director  is  still  required  to
evaluate and assess the institutes.

H.R. 5618 designates the Sea Grant Review Panel as the National Sea Grant Ad-
visory  Board.  The  duties  of  the  Board  are  to  advise  the  Secretary  and  the  Director
on  strategies  for  utilizing  Sea  Grant  institutes  to  address  ocean,  coastal  and  Great
Lakes issues; on the designation of new Sea Grant institutes; and any other matter
the Secretary refers to the Board.

H.R.  5618  authorizes  increases  in  funding  levels  from  $66  million  in  fiscal  year
2009 to $100 million in fiscal year 2014. This is a significant yet measured improve-
ment  over  the  approximately  $57  million  that  the  program  has  been  allocated  over
recent years.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Good  morning.  I  want  to  welcome  everyone
to today’s hearing, to the National Sea Grant College Program Act:
H.R. 5618.

H.R.  5618  was  introduced  by  our  colleague,  Congresswoman
Madeleine Bordallo, Chair of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wild-
life  and  Oceans  of  the  Committee  on  Natural  Resources.  The  Sea
Grant  program  is  a  partnership  between  State  and  Federal  Gov-
ernment  to  promote  the  understanding,  conservation  and  manage-
ment of our ocean, coastal and Great Lakes resources.

Growth  of  the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  has  been
stunted  during  the  last  two  years,  and  over  time  the  flat  funding
level  has  impacted  the  services  delivered  on  a  daily  basis  to  our
coastal  communities.  With  the  cost  of  research  and  education  ris-
ing,  programs  have  been  forced  to  reduce  staff  and  a  number  of
education  and  outreach  activities  as  well.  H.R.  5618  seeks  to
amend  the  Sea  Grant  Program  to  implement  changes  in  the  pro-
gram  recommended  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences.  Some  of
these improvements include increasing the interaction between the
National  Sea  Grant  Office  and  the  individual  State  programs  as
well  as  improving  programmatic  performance  reviews  and  author-
izing increased funding levels.

We  have  a  distinguished  panel  of  witnesses  here  today  who  will
highlight  the  activities  and  accomplishments  of  this  program  and
offer their recommendations as to how we can improve this impor-
tant  research,  education  and  extension  program.  I  want  to  thank
all of our witnesses for being here today.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Lampson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

Good morning. I want to welcome everyone to today’s hearing on the National Sea
Grant  College  Program  Act:  H.R.  5618.  H.R.  5618  was  introduced  by  our  colleague,
Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo, Chair of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wild-
life, and Oceans of the Committee on Natural Resources.

The  Sea  Grant  program  is  a  partnership  between  State  and  Federal  Government
to promote the understanding, conservation, and management of our ocean, coastal,
and Great Lakes resources.

Growth  of  the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  has  been  stunted  during  the
last few years. Over time the flat funding level has impacted the services delivered
on a daily basis to our coastal communities.

With the costs of research and education rising, programs have been forced to re-

duce staff and a number of education and outreach activities.

H.R.  5618  seeks  to  amend  the  Sea  Grant  Program  to  implement  changes  in  the

program recommended by the National Academy of Sciences.

Some  of  these  improvements  include  increasing  the  interaction  between  the  Na-
tional  Sea  Grant  Office  and  the  individual  State  programs;  as  well  as  improving
programmatic performance reviews and authorizing increased funding levels.

We have a distinguished panel of witnesses here today who will highlight the ac-
tivities and accomplishments of this program and offer their recommendations as to
how we can improve this important research, education, and extension program.

I  want  to  thank  all  of  our  witnesses  for  being  here  today.  At  this  time,  I  would
like  to  recognize  our  distinguished  Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Inglis  of  South  Carolina
for his opening statement.

Chairman LAMPSON. At this time I would like to yield to my dis-
tinguished  colleague  from  South  Carolina,  our  Ranking  Member,
Mr. Inglis, for an opening statement.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding

this hearing.

Since its inception in 1966, the National Sea Grant Program has
been  a  successful  collaborative  effort  of  the  Federal  Government,
State  governments  and  universities.  Under  the  program,  these
groups  work  together  to  understand,  develop  and  conserve  our
coastal  and  ocean  resources.  That  is  particularly  important  for  us
in  South  Carolina  and  other  coastal  states.  Currently,  more  than
half  of  the  U.S.  population  lives  on  the  coast  and  that  number  is
increasing, and coastal and ocean resources generate more than $1
trillion of the annual gross domestic product.

This reauthorization should equip the Sea Grant program to con-
tinue  to  provide  sound  science  and  management  products  to  such
a large part of our economy and population.

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from
our witnesses and hearing their perspectives on this legislation and
any suggestions they may have as to improvements.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the Subcommittee giving attention to this matter and

the reauthorization of H.R. 5618, the National Sea Grant College Program Act.

The  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  was  established  in  1966  and  has  since
grown  in  stature  and  responsibilities  since  its  most  recent  reauthorization  in  2002.
The program is an example of a dynamic partnership among academia, government
and the private sector to improve the management of the coastal, marine and Great
Lakes environment.

Unfortunately, as with many important federal programs, difficult economic times
have not allowed the Sea Grant Program’s budget to grow to keep up with inflation,
much less be granted with a substantial increase.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  our  witnesses’  testimony  today  and  working  with  my
colleagues  on  the  Committee  to  improve  and  strengthen  this  important  program.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

Chairman LAMPSON. It is my pleasure to introduce the witnesses
for  this  morning.  Mr.  Craig  McLean  is  the  Deputy  Assistant  Ad-
ministrator  for  Programs  and  Administration  for  Oceanic  and  At-
mospheric  Research  at  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Ad-
ministration,  NOAA.  Mr.  Paul  S.  Anderson  is  the  President  of  the
Sea  Grant  Association  and  the  Director  of  the  Maine  Sea  Grant
College  Program.  Mr.  M.  Richard  DeVoe  is  the  Executive  Director

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  CRAIG  N.  MCLEAN,  DEPUTY  ASSISTANT
ADMINISTRATOR  FOR  PROGRAMS  AND  ADMINISTRATION,
OFFICE  OF  OCEANIC  AND  ATMOSPHERIC  RESEARCH,  NA-
TIONAL  OCEANIC  AND  ATMOSPHERIC  ADMINISTRATION,
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
Mr. MCLEAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning Ranking
Member Inglis, and Mr. Bartlett, good morning. I am pleased to be
here  this  morning  to  discuss  the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Pro-
gram. It is a very important program to NOAA.

Sea  Grant  is  an  integral  part  of  NOAA’s  mission  to  understand
and  predict  the  Earth’s  environment  and  to  conserve  and  manage
coastal, marine and Great Lakes resources. Sea Grant is a national
network  comprised  of  the  NOAA  National  Sea  Grant  Panel,  the
Sea Grant Office, 32 university-sponsored programs, the Sea Grant
Law  Library  and  the  Sea  Grant  Law  Center,  fellowship  programs
and  hundreds  of  participating  institutions.  Each  Sea  Grant  State
program is established through competition and receives evaluation
every  four  years.  By  linking  university  resources  and  expertise
with  local  communities  and  user  groups,  Sea  Grant  promotes  the
effective  transfer  of  science-based  information  in  support  of  deci-
sion-making.  In  short,  Sea  Grant  takes  complex  information  and
shows people how to use it and how to solve real problems.

Sea  Grant  also  expands  the  reach  and  effectiveness  of  other
NOAA programs and other partners by leveraging additional funds.
Sea  Grant  Programs  are  required  to  match  every  $2  of  federal
funding with $1 of contributory funding and many states far exceed
this  match.  In  2006,  for  example,  State  Sea  Grant  programs  pro-
vided  $27  million  of  matching  funds  for  their  NOAA  awards  and
stimulated contributions of an additional $62 million from a variety
of State and federal sources.

Over  the  past  two  years,  we  have  aggressively  responded  to  the
recommendations  of  the  2006  National  Research  Council  report  on
Sea Grant. The program is developing a more coordinated strategic
plan for the next five years and will address issues affecting coastal
regions locally and nationally.

In  the  future,  Sea  Grant  will  also  play  a  critical  role  in  identi-
fying  the  coastal  and  constituent  needs  for  climate  research,  cli-
mate  services  and  climate-related  information.  This  will  be  a  very
important contribution for Sea Grant.

NOAA  is  supportive  of  efforts  to  reauthorize  the  National  Sea
Grant  College  Program  Act,  and  in  fact,  the  Administration  is
transmitting to Congress the proposed bill that the Administration
has to offer and perhaps it may have even arrived as early as last
night.

10

The  Administration’s  reauthorizing  bill  and  H.R.  5618,  the  Na-
tional  Sea  Grant  College  Program  Amendments  Act  of  2008,  take
very  similar  approaches  to  strengthening  this  program.  Both  bills
promote  Sea  Grant  program  investments  in  national  activities  by
increasing  the  non-match  funding  pool.  The  Administration  bill
proposes  an  increase  in  the  non-match  funding  pool  from  one  per-
cent to five percent and includes the entire Knauss Fellowship Pro-
gram.

Both  bills  retain  the  requirements  to  evaluate  and  assess  the
performance  of  State  Sea  Grant  programs  but  removes  the  rigid
ranking  requirements  amongst  the  states.  This  change  would  re-
move  any  disincentive  to  cooperation  in  the  National  Research
Council report as it had identified and thereby facilitate the devel-
opment  of  regional  collaborations  among  the  Sea  Grant  programs.
Both  bills  seek  to  strength  Sea  Grant  programs  by  elevating  the
role  and  functions  of  the  National  Sea  Grant  Review  Panel.  Over
the  past  30  years,  the  role  of  the  panel  has  evolved  with  Sea
Grant’s  influence  and  effectiveness.  Consistent  with  the  rec-
ommendations  of  the  National  Research  Council  report,  both  bills
propose to change the duties of the panel on providing strategic ad-
vice regarding the national program as well as providing an assess-
ment of the overall effectiveness of the program.

The Administration’s proposed reauthorization bill and H.R. 5618
do have nominal differences, and one of them is the size of the cap
on  Administration  funding  to  support  the  program  and  on  the
matching  fund  requirements  in  order  to  support  the  development
of  regional  and  national  partnerships.  The  Administration  bill  ad-
vances Sea Grant’s capacity for regional and national leadership by
adjusting the cap of Administration funding from five to seven per-
cent,  which  is  responsive  to  the  NRC’s  report  recommendation  to
allocate resources sufficient to allow the NOAA National Sea Grant
Program  Office  to  accomplish  its  mission  of  oversight,  leadership
and guidance of the program.

The National Sea Grant Office today is about half the size it was
15  years  ago  in  terms  of  staff,  and  the  seniority  of  that  staff  has
diminished as well. The increasing in funding for the National Sea
Grant College Office will strengthen the core of the Sea Grant net-
work. To promote Sea Grant’s involvement in regional and national
partnerships,  the  Administration  bill  proposes  exempting  these
partnership  activities  from  the  matching  fund  requirements.  We
recognize  the  significance  of  the  matching  fund  requirement  as  a
means  to  leveraging  funding.  However,  the  requirement  has  at
times  made  it  difficult  to  form  regional  and  national  partnerships
and  interagency  collaborations.  The  proposed  change  would  allow
Sea Grant programs to collaborate with a broader array of partners
to address issues that are best addressed regionally and nationally.
In closing, Sea Grant is an effective program and it addresses the
right  problems  defined  by  constituents,  produces  meaningful
science  and  relates  directly  to  the  attainment  of  NOAA’s  mission
objectives.  Sea  Grant’s  ability  to  leverage  resources  and  address
issues in partnership and with other entities is truly unique in gov-
ernment.  The  reauthorization  of  Sea  Grant  is  important  to  NOAA
and  we  look  forward  to  working  with  you  as  the  legislation  moves
through  Congress.  Together  we  can  ensure  that  the  National  Sea

Grant  College  Program  continues  to  generate  practical  solutions
based  on  sound  science  that  address  real  problems  in  real  places.

Thank you, and I look forward to addressing your questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CRAIG N. MCLEAN

I  am  Craig  McLean,  Deputy  Assistant  Administrator  for  Programs  and  Adminis-
tration of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, within the National Oce-
anic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA).  The  Office  of  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric  Research  conducts  and  sponsors  the  scientific  research,  environmental  stud-
ies, and technology development needed to improve NOAA’s operations and applica-
tions,  and  broaden  our  understanding  of  the  Earth’s  atmosphere  and  oceans.
NOAA’s National Sea Grant College Program is contained within the Office of Oce-
anic  and  Atmospheric  Research.  The  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  is
NOAA’s  primary  university-based  program  in  support  of  coastal  resource  use  and
conservation.  Sea  Grant’s  research,  outreach,  and  education  programs  promote  bet-
ter understanding, stewardship, and use of America’s coastal resources.

I am pleased to be here to tell you about the National Sea Grant College Program.
Today,  I  will  discuss  Sea  Grant’s  vision  and  mission,  what  lies  ahead  for  the  pro-
gram,  the  issues  we  would  like  to  see  addressed  in  its  upcoming  reauthorization,
and why this program is important to NOAA.

Sea Grant’s Vision and Mission

Sea Grant’s legislative charge (33 U.S.C. 1121) is ‘‘to increase the understanding,
assessment, development, utilization, and conservation of the Nation’s ocean, coast-
al, and Great Lakes resources by providing assistance to promote a strong education
base,  responsive  research  and  training  activities,  broad  and  prompt  dissemination
of  knowledge  and  techniques,  and  multi-disciplinary  approaches  to  environmental
problems.’’

The  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  envisions  a  future  where  people  live
along our coasts in harmony with the natural resources that attracted and continue
to sustain them. This is a vision of our nation’s coasts in which we use our natural
resources  in  ways  that  capture  the  economic  and  recreational  benefits  they  offer,
while preserving their quality and abundance for future generations.

Sea Grant is an integral part of NOAA’s mission and instrumental in helping the
agency  achieve  its  objectives  in  coastal  communities  throughout  the  United  States
and our territories. Sea Grant’s research, outreach and education activities are con-
nected  to  NOAA’s  mission,  which  is  to  understand  and  predict  changes  in  Earth’s
environment  and  conserve  and  manage  coastal  and  marine  resources  to  meet  our
nation’s economic, social, and environmental needs.

The National Sea Grant College Program

The  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  was  created  42  years  ago  to  unite  the
academic power of the Nation’s universities with a wide range of public and private
sector partners. Sea Grant brings together government, universities and citizens liv-
ing  and  working  in  our  nation’s  coastal  and  Great  Lakes  states  and  territories  to
respond to problems and opportunities in these complex and dynamic environments.
Through  these  partnerships,  Sea  Grant  provides  integrated  research,  and  outreach
and  education  programs  aimed  at  creating  tangible  benefits  for  ocean,  coastal  and
Great Lakes environments and communities.

Sea Grant is a national network comprised of NOAA’s National Sea Grant Office,
32  university-based  State  programs,  the  National  Sea  Grant  Review  Panel,  a  Na-
tional Law Center, a National Sea Grant Library and hundreds of participating in-
stitutions.  Each  Sea  Grant  program  is  established  through  a  competitive  process
and reviewed every four years. The Sea Grant network enables NOAA and the Na-
tion to harness the best science, technology and human expertise to balance human
and environmental needs in coastal regions.

Sea  Grant’s  alliance  with  major  research  universities  provides  support  to  more
than  3,000  scientists,  outreach  specialists,  educators,  and  students  every  year.  Col-
lectively,  Sea  Grant  has  formed  partnerships  with  over  4,000  organizations  to  help
reach  its  mission  goals.  Sea  Grant’s  university-based  programs  develop  future  sci-
entists and managers to conduct research and to guide the responsible management
of  our  nation’s  coastal,  ocean,  and  Great  Lakes  resources.  As  a  pioneer  in  what  is
referred  to  as  ‘‘translational  research:  from  discovery  to  application,’’  Sea  Grant
strives  for  unbiased,  science-based  information  that  is  accessible  to  all.  The  diverse
capabilities of Sea Grant’s network of State programs enable the organization to be

12

creative and responsive in generating policy-relevant research and in disseminating
scientific  and  technological  discoveries  to  a  wide  array  of  audiences.  Because  it  is
science-based, non-regulatory, and has an established presence in local communities,
Sea  Grant  is  a  trusted  broker,  working  to  increase  coastal,  ocean  and  Great  Lakes
literacy among decision-makers and the public as a whole. Sea Grant’s commitment
to these core values is vital to achieving its mission.

With  its  strong  research  capabilities,  local  knowledge  and  on-the-ground  work-
force, Sea Grant is ready to identify and capitalize on opportunities, and to generate
practical  solutions.  Sea  Grant  extension,  with  its  unique  relationship  with  coastal
partners,  helps  identify  key  local  and  regional  issues  for  the  university-based  pro-
grams  whose  resources  are  directed  to  solve  these  problems.  Extension  is  defined
as  the  effective  transfer  of  science-based  information  by  university  specialists  and
agents  to  support  decision-making  by  individuals,  groups  or  institutions.  Extension
agents  link  university  resources  and  expertise  with  local  communities  and  user
groups.  In  short,  these  specialists  take  complex  information  and  show  people  how
to use it to solve problems. For example, Sea Grant was successful in working with
the  city  of  Cleveland,  Ohio  to  construct  artificial  reefs  from  the  rubble  of  the  old
Cleveland  Municipal  Stadium  in  the  near-shore  zone  of  Lake  Erie.  Estimates  indi-
cate  that  these  reefs  attract  12  to  66  times  as  many  fish  as  the  surrounding  non-
reef areas and produce approximately $1 million of economic benefit annually. This
is  just  one  example  of  how  Sea  Grant  agents  work  with  communities  in  order  to
share expertise and solve problems.

Sea  Grant  also  expands  the  reach  and  effectiveness  of  NOAA  and  other  partners
in  planning  for  and  managing  the  future  of  America’s  ocean,  coastal  and  Great
Lakes  resources  by  leveraging  additional  funds.  Sea  Grant  programs  are  required
to  match  every  $2  of  federal  funding  with  $1  of  non-federal  funds,  and  many  State
programs  far  exceed  this  match.  The  match  required  for  federal  funding  also  en-
sures this country receives significant benefit from each dollar invested by the Fed-
eral Government in Sea Grant.

The  success  of  Sea  Grant’s  approach  to  coastal  resource  use  and  stewardship  is
being recognized globally. Other countries are using the Sea Grant model when de-
signing  their  own  programs  for  engaging  universities  in  marine  research  through
granting  programs,  outreach,  and  education.  With  the  assistance  of  Sea  Grant,
Korea  has  developed  its  own  Sea  Grant  program  and  Indonesia  has  created  a  Sea
Partnership Program with a network that extends country-wide.

Sea Grant’s Work

Sea  Grant  addresses  emerging  issues  at  local,  regional  and  national  levels
through  its  integrated  national  network  by  bringing  decades  of  experience  and  ex-
pertise  through  its  scientists,  extension  agents,  educators  and  communicators  lo-
cated in every coastal and Great Lakes state, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Pacific island
territories.

By  investing  in  mission-priority  research,  Sea  Grant  addresses  issues  such  as
growth  in  coastal  communities,  hurricane  preparedness  and  response,  coastal
storms  and  tsunamis,  invasive  species,  development  of  drugs  and  industrial  mate-
rials  from  marine  resources,  fish  and  shellfish  farming  and  seafood  safety.  Each
year,  Sea  Grant  supports  some  400  research  projects  investigating  a  wide  variety
of marine and coastal topics, and produces more than 700 peer-reviewed journal ar-
ticles and book chapters.

While  research  is  a  crucial  component  of  Sea  Grant,  transferring  the  results  of
research  to  the  people  who  can  benefit  from  this  knowledge  is  equally  important.
Sea Grant’s network of more than 300 extension experts work with coastal commu-
nities  and  decision-makers  to  provide  informal  education  and  transfer  new  tech-
nologies. These extension experts work with communities in countless ways, includ-
ing:

tices;

• helping  fish  farmers  develop  environmentally-sound  shellfish  farming  prac-
• explaining the impacts of land use on water quality; and
• providing  technical  assistance  to  communities  planning  for  and  dealing  with

hurricanes and other natural hazards.

Education  is  an  integral  part  of  Sea  Grant’s  outreach  program.  A  network  of  30
Sea Grant educators work with K–12 teachers to bring environmental sciences into
the classroom and the classroom out into the natural environment. Sea Grant’s sup-
port for higher education over three decades of service has trained more than 12,000
college  and  graduate  students,  preparing  them  to  be  the  next  generation  of  coastal
stewards.  More  than  650  alumni  within  the  Dean  John  A.  Knauss  Marine  Policy

Fellowship program now hold positions in NOAA, other partner agencies, the indus-
try  sector,  and  non-governmental  organizations.  This  strong  workforce  is  needed  to
solve the major environmental challenges that face the Nation and the planet.

Each  program  within  the  Sea  Grant  network  has  a  dedicated  communications
staff  that  works  to  deliver  accurate,  reliable,  science-based  information.  Through
newsletters,  brochures,  posters,  articles,  web  sites,  books,  radio,  videotape,  and
other  media,  Sea  Grant’s  network  of  more  than  100  communicators  have  earned
their reputations as honest brokers of information about marine and coastal issues.
In  recent  years,  Sea  Grant  communications  experts  have  created  products  ranging
from environmental radio podcasts and video documentaries to informational guides
and books about the history and science of the Nation’s coastal regions.

Sea  Grant’s  place-based  programs  throughout  the  Nation  give  the  organization
the  flexibility  to  respond  to  emerging  needs.  Sea  Grant  worked  throughout  coastal
Louisiana  following  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita  to  help  coastal  communities  re-
cover. The recovery of Louisiana’s Plaquemines Parish following Hurricanes Katrina
and  Rita  was  an  example  of  Sea  Grant’s  ability  to  respond  to  these  disasters.  Sea
Grant’s work in Louisiana included partnerships with the private sector. Investment
firm Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sent 30 volunteers and donated $50,000 to the Sea
Grant-led  volunteer  efforts.  The  funding  helped  Sea  Grant  extension  agents  orga-
nize  volunteer  workers  who  came  into  the  city  and  put  them  in  touch  with  people
with the greatest needs to help Plaquemines Parrish recover in time for fishing sea-
son.  In  addition,  Sea  Grant  worked  with  energy  firm  Royal  Dutch  Shell  plc  and
partners to facilitate the donation of an industrial ice house to serve Cameron Par-
ish.  The  ice  house  was  a  critical  component  of  the  re-vitalization  of  the  Louisiana
seafood industry.

Sea Grant’s research efforts have catalyzed a greater understanding of our coastal
resources.  Sea  Grant’s  investment  in  biotechnology,  for  instance,  has  led  to  the  de-
velopment  of  novel  marine  products  and  processes.  Impacts  from  this  research  ex-
tend from the marine and aquatic realm to dimensions of human health and safety.
A Great Lakes Sea Grant researcher invented two new technologies to mass produce
anti-toxins and gauge infections. One will harvest a human antidote to counter bio-
terrorism;  the  other  technology  detects  deadly  pathogens  like  salmonella,  E.  coli,
and cholera. This patent-pending biosensor process can detect the state of more than
50 pathogens within minutes.

Another Sea Grant research project eliminated organic contaminants from menha-
den  oil.  Fish  oil  is  an  important  ingredient  in  pet  foods  and  aquaculture  feeds,  but
organic  contaminants  have  kept  the  processed  product  from  being  sold  in  lucrative
international  markets.  The  research  demonstrated  a  simple  refining  process  to
eliminate dioxin and other impurities from crude fish oil allowing a fish oil producer
operating  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  to  deliver  a  product  that  meets  European  Union
specifications.  A  Sea  Grant  investment  of  less  than  $50,000  saved  200  jobs  in  Lou-
isiana and helped boost U.S. exports.

Sea  Grant  conducts  socioeconomic  research  to  help  coastal  managers  formulate
policies  that  minimize  the  negative  ecological  impacts  of  coastal  development  and
coastal resource use. For example, Sea Grant worked with the Rhode Island Coastal
Resources  Management  Council  to  help  them  develop  an  innovative  Urban  Coastal
Greenway Policy that provides a new level of flexibility to a previously rigid coastal
development regulatory structure—both in terms of environmental protection and in
building  and  landscape  aesthetics.  The  policy  enabled  the  partners  to  collaborate
more  closely  with  developers  on  their  plans  during  the  application  process,  and  to
tailor the plans to best benefit the coastal environment, the developer and the public
alike.  As  a  result,  Sea  Grant  and  its  partners  have  been  able  to  secure  almost  two
miles  of  new  public  access  along  the  urban  shore,  while  still  maintaining  the  eco-
nomic integrity of development plans and the environmental quality of a critical por-
tion of northern Narragansett Bay.

Sea Grant helps the seafood industry increase quality and safety, add value, lower
costs and expand seafood supplies and markets, with more than 30 years of experi-
ence working in every coastal and Great Lake state and involving every type of sea-
food  product.  Since  2001,  training  courses  led  by  Sea  Grant  extension  and  others
with the National Seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Al-
liance (an intergovernmental partnership with industry and academia) have reached
about 5,000 U.S. processing plants, 6,000 importers and international suppliers and
14,000 employees and regulators. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices  estimates  that  the  HACCP  program  has  prevented  between  20,000  and  60,000
seafood-related illnesses a year, translating into savings of about $155 million annu-
ally.  In  one  survey  of  seafood  businesses,  77  percent  reported  that  they  could  not
have met FDA regulations without the HACCP training programs. Sea Grant exten-
sion staff have also extended HACCP protocols to address invasive species, offering

training to aquaculturists in the Great Lakes in order to prevent the spread of high-
ly destructive aquatic invasive species.

Sea  Grant  researchers  and  outreach  specialists  are  uniquely  situated  to  promote
collaborations  on  subjects  critical  to  decisions  being  made  by  fisheries  managers  on
a  variety  of  topics  from  stock  assessment,  habitat  and  ecosystem  health,  environ-
mental contamination and conflict resolution, among many others. For example, Sea
Grant  researchers  have  developed  a  revolutionary,  rapid  and  reliable  method  of
DNA  analysis  to  identify  shark  species  from  fins,  carcasses  and  other  body  parts.
This one-step forensics technique allows for the identification of U.S. fishing vessels
suspected of catching and selling protected species such as the dusky and the great
white shark. This technology helped federal prosecutors confirm the presence of pro-
hibited species in four of five investigations, resulting in fines of more than $100,000
and creating further deterrence for illegal fishing activities. Thus far, the Sea Grant
research  team  has  fully  developed  and  tested  DNA  markers  for  18  U.S.  Atlantic
shark species.

Recognizing  the  demand  for  fisheries  extension  services  and  the  complexity  of
fisheries  issues,  the  National  Sea  Grant  Office  and  NOAA’s  National  Marine  Fish-
eries Service (NMFS) were asked by Congress to develop a program to improve com-
munications  with  and  among  fisheries  constituents.  The  partnership  between  Sea
Grant and NMFS was enhanced by developing a regionally-coordinated, constituent-
based  fisheries  extension  program.  The  initial  Sea  Grant  investment  of  $5  million
led to:

• a  partnership  between  NMFS  and  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  to  re-
duce  seabird  bycatch  in  the  Bering  Sea  and  Gulf  of  Alaska,  an  activity  that
led to new fishing regulations and circumvented potential lawsuits that might
have shut down a $200 million fishery;
• the  Eliminator  Trawl  designed  to  catch  underutilized  haddock,  likely  result-
ing  in  economic  gains  of  $30  million—a  design  for  which  Rhode  Island  Sea
Grant  extension  agents  were  awarded  the  grand  prize  in  the  2007  World
Wildlife Federation’s International Smart Gear Competition; and
• a partnership between the National Marine Fisheries Service Southeast Fish-
eries Center and Sea Grant extension agents to deliver training programs and
to distribute 1,000 bycatch reduction devices to fishermen in the Gulf of Mex-
ico.

This list of just some examples of accomplishments demonstrates many of the Sea
Grant  capabilities  that  have  earned  it  a  reputation  as  a  highly  effective  national
program.

Future of Sea Grant
National Strategic Planning

Sea Grant is currently completing its national strategic planning process for 2009
to  2013.  This  five-year  strategic  plan  establishes  direction  for  the  Sea  Grant  net-
work  to  address  critical  national  needs  in  coastal,  ocean  and  Great  Lakes  environ-
ments.  The  plan  capitalizes  on  Sea  Grant’s  unique  capacities  and  strengths,  allows
for flexibility and creativity on the part of State Sea Grant programs, and supports
a broad range of priorities in NOAA’s strategic plan, and NOAA’s 20-Year Research
Vision and Five-Year Research Plan.

Over  the  next  five  years,  Sea  Grant  will  concentrate  effort  in  four  focus  areas:
healthy coastal ecosystems, sustainable coastal development, a safe and sustainable
seafood  supply,  and  hazard  resilience  in  coastal  communities.  These  four  inter-
related  focus  areas  emerged  from  diverse  stakeholder  input,  including  advice  from
the Sea Grant Review Panel, during the strategic planning process as areas of crit-
ical importance to the health and vitality of the Nation’s coastal resources and com-
munities. These areas reflect issues of major importance to NOAA and are areas in
which  Sea  Grant  has  made  substantial  contributions  in  the  past  and  is  positioned
to  make  contributions  in  the  future.  In  addition,  these  focus  areas  are  consistent
with  the  work  of  the  NOAA  coastal  program  integration  effort  which  is  working  to
improve  coordination  in  the  development  and  delivery  of  services  within  NOAA’s
coastal programs.

Sea Grant’s new strategic plan will address timely issues affecting coastal regions,
including issues related to climate change, coastal hazards and coastal development.
Sea  Grant’s  extension  staff,  with  diverse  backgrounds  and  coastal  specialties,  will
play  a  critical  role  in  identifying  local  needs  for  climate  research  and  information.
Sea  Grant  extension  staff  can  serve  as  intermediaries  between  NOAA’s  climate  re-
searchers and coastal decision-makers, helping to define and deliver NOAA’s climate

tools and products that are needed at the local level. In this way, Sea Grant’s work
complements the outreach efforts of other NOAA programs, such as the National In-
tegrated Drought Information System and the Regional Integrated Sciences and As-
sessments program, with Sea Grant maintaining a specific focus on coastal commu-
nities. Sea Grant is committed to support research and outreach to effectively apply
innovative  techniques  to  restore  degraded  ecosystems.  Also,  Sea  Grant  has  recog-
nized  the  need  to  invest  in  research  that  evaluates  the  environmental  and  socio-
economic trade-offs involved in coastal planning and decision-making.

Sea  Grant  is  one  of  many  partners  working  to  address  these  complex  and  inter-
related issues. Using partnerships to accomplish shared goals is a strategy inherent
to Sea Grant and key to its successes.

Regional Plans

Consistent with the President’s U.S. Ocean Action Plan, and the recommendations
of  the  U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy,  NOAA  has  committed  to  adopting  eco-
system-based approaches to management to achieve balance among ecological, envi-
ronmental  and  social  influences  in  our  nation’s  coastal,  ocean  and  Great  Lakes  re-
gions.  In  order  to  advance  this  effort,  regional  coordinators  of  Sea  Grant  programs
are  facilitating  planning  efforts  to  aid  in  the  transition  toward  regional  ecosystem-
based  management.  Sea  Grant  is  engaging  a  wide  array  of  stakeholders  to  develop
a  ‘‘bottom-up’’  needs  assessment  by  identifying  research  and  information  gaps,  de-
veloping prioritized management-based regional research and information plans, co-
ordinating  technology  and  information  transfer  to  appropriate  end  users,  and  pro-
viding  an  ongoing  platform  for  coordination,  collaboration,  and  resource-sharing
among participants.

These  regional  plans  will  include  clear  statements  of  the  major  regional,  ocean
and coastal management issues, outlines of existing scientific and informational re-
sources,  analyses  of  the  information  necessary  to  address  the  critical  issues,  and  a
prioritized  list  of  actions  to  be  taken.  Each  final  plan  will  include  a  prioritized  list
of  forecast  products  that  would  aid  in  the  transition  toward  regional  ecosystem-
based management. Eight regions are currently participating in this planning proc-
ess  (Gulf  of  Maine,  Great  Lakes,  Insular  Pacific,  Alaska,  Pacific  Northwest,  Pacific
Southwest,  Gulf  of  Mexico,  and  the  South  Atlantic)  and  their  plans  will  be  com-
pleted  by  the  end  of  FY  2008.  The  remaining  three  regions  (New  York  Bight,  Mid-
Atlantic and the Caribbean) are beginning the process in FY 2008, with plans sched-
uled for completion by the end of FY 2010.

Although the planning process is not complete, every region has identified climate
change  impacts  as  a  top  priority  for  research,  including  research  that  refines  pre-
dictive  models  to  regional  and  local  scales,  and  consideration  of  socioeconomic  and
ecological effects. Beyond this issue, priorities are as diverse as the different regions’
geological and ecological signatures. The Insular Pacific region prioritizes beach and
reef restoration research, in the Great Lakes the priority is aquatic invasive species,
in the Northeast the priority is storm safety, and along the Pacific coast the priority
is  ocean  observation  systems  for  better  assessing  the  land-sea  connection.  Each  re-
gion must include an outreach component in their plan, ensuring timely delivery of
pertinent technologies and tools to the appropriate users.

Sea Grant Reauthorization

The National Sea Grant College Program Act (Act) was first enacted in 1966 and
has  been  amended  nine  times,  most  recently  in  2002.  The  current  reauthorization
expires  at  the  end  of  fiscal  year  2008.  NOAA  is  supportive  of  efforts  to  reauthorize
this Act as the National Sea Grant College Program has achieved significant accom-
plishments  nationwide  in  promoting  research,  education,  training,  and  advisory
service  activities  that  have  increased  the  understanding,  assessment,  development,
utilization  and  conservation  of  the  Nation’s  ocean,  coastal  and  Great  Lakes  re-
sources.

The Administration will shortly transmit to Congress proposed legislation to reau-
thorize the National Sea Grant College Program. In preparing the proposed legisla-
tion,  the  National  Sea  Grant  Office  reviewed  the  program’s  successes  and  the  chal-
lenges  encountered  since  the  program’s  last  reauthorization  in  2002.  The  resulting
Administration  bill  proposes  changes  to  advance  Sea  Grant’s  capability  to  address
regional  and  national  issues,  enhance  NOAA’s  ability  to  administer  and  provide
guidance to the Sea Grant program, and redefine the role of the National Sea Grant
Review Panel.

The  Administration’s  reauthorization  bill  and  National  Sea  Grant  College  Pro-
gram  Amendments  Act  of  2008  (H.R.  5618)  in  many  instances  take  similar  ap-
proaches to strengthening the Sea Grant program.

16

Both bills promote continued Sea Grant program investment in national activities
by  increasing  the  non-match  funding  pool.  Specifically,  the  Administration  bill  pro-
poses  increasing  the  non-match  funding  pool  from  1  percent  to  five  percent,  includ-
ing the Knauss Fellowship Program.

This proposed change will enhance the quality of the Sea Grant network by allow-
ing the Sea Grant program to enhance its support for national facilities such as the
Sea  Grant  Law  Center,  and  enhance  its  ability  to  respond  rapidly  to  emerging
issues, such as recovery from a hurricane, at the local and regional level.

Both bills promote greater partnership opportunities among State Sea Grant pro-
grams by adjusting the current requirements for how the State programs are evalu-
ated.  In  the  last  reauthorization  (2002)  a  requirement  was  added  that  State  pro-
grams be ranked based on their relative performance and any new funding for exist-
ing programs be awarded based on those rankings. While the intent was to provide
a  competitive  opportunity  for  individual  programs  to  receive  additional  funding
based on merit, the National Research Council’s 2006 report, ‘‘Evaluation of the Sea
Grant Program Review Process,’’ pointed out that as an unintended consequence the
2002 amendment also created a financial disincentive for programs to work coopera-
tively  and  to  form  regional  partnerships  with  each  other.  The  Administration’s  bill
and H.R. 5618 both remove the requirement to rate programs within five categories
of  performance.  Both  bills  retain  the  requirement  to  evaluate  and  assess  the  per-
formance of State Sea Grant programs, but remove the relative ranking requirement
in  order  to  facilitate  the  development  of  regional  collaborations  among  the  Sea
Grant programs.

Both  bills  seek  to  strengthen  the  Sea  Grant  program  by  elevating  the  role  and
functions of the National Sea Grant Review Panel. The National Sea Grant Review
Panel  (Panel)  was  established  in  1976  to  provide  advice  on  all  applications  sub-
mitted  to  Sea  Grant  for  funding,  on  the  Sea  Grant  fellowship  program,  on  the  des-
ignation  and  operation  of  Sea  Grant  colleges  and  on  the  development  and  applica-
tion  of  planning  guidelines  and  priorities.  Over  the  past  30  years,  the  role  of  the
Panel has evolved in consonance with the evolution of Sea Grant’s influence and ef-
fectiveness. The Panel no longer reviews funding or fellowship applications and the
designation  of  new  Sea  Grant  colleges  happens  rarely  as  the  Sea  Grant  network  of
colleges  in  our  coastal  and  Great  Lakes  states  is  virtually  complete.  The  2006  Na-
tional  Research  Council  report  called  for  the  Panel  to  be  ‘‘better  positioned  to  com-
ment on issues of broader significance to the overall program,’’ and stated the Pan-
el’s sole function should be ‘‘to promote the effectiveness of the program as a whole.’’
Both bills propose changes that focus the duties of the Panel on providing strategic
advice regarding the national program, as well as providing assessment of the over-
all  effectiveness  of  the  program.  These  proposed  changes  will  better  enable  the
Panel to address the needs of the program as it has evolved since 1976.

The Administration’s proposed reauthorization bill and H.R. 5618 do differ on the
issue of the size of the cap on administrative funding and on the matching funding
requirement with regards to regional and national partnerships.

The  Administration  bill  advances  Sea  Grant’s  capacity  for  regional  and  national
leadership by adjusting the cap on administrative funding, while H.R. 5618 does not
make  any  adjustments  to  the  cap.  Specifically,  the  Administration  bill  proposes  in-
creasing  the  administrative  cap  from  five  percent  to  seven  percent.  Staffing  in
NOAA’s  National  Sea  Grant  Office  (NSGO)  is  about  half  what  it  was  15  years  ago
despite the expansion of the network of Sea Grant Programs. The 2006 National Re-
search Council report found that ‘‘the NSGO does not currently play a sufficient role
in  ongoing  program  assistance,  monitoring,  communication,  and  assessment’’  and
recommended  that  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  ‘‘take  steps  to  ensure  that  sufficient
human  and  fiscal  resources  are  available  to  allow  robust,  ongoing  and  meaningful
interaction’’ among the NSGO, the State programs, and their home institutions. By
increasing the resources available to NOAA for administration of the Sea Grant Pro-
gram, the Administration’s bill would allow for approximately eight to ten additional
full time employees to be hired at the NSGO. The increase in staffing for the NSGO
would strengthen the core of the entire Sea Grant network by allowing us to: more
quickly  process,  review  and  approve  programs’  omnibus  and  other  program  grant
applications;  increase  NOAA’s  participation  in  State  program  strategic  and  annual
planning  processes;  enhance  program  oversight  and  evaluation;  and  improve  com-
munication  and  collaboration  among  Sea  Grant,  other  NOAA  programs,  and  other
federal agencies and non-governmental organizations.

Both the Administration’s bill and H.R. 5618 seek to promote Sea Grant’s involve-
ment in regional and national partnerships. However, the Administration’s bill spe-
cifically  proposes  exempting  regional  and  national  partnerships,  as  well  as  inter-
agency  cooperation,  from  the  matching  funding  requirement  as  a  means  to  achieve
the  goal  of  greater  Sea  Grant  involvement  in  these  activities.  Sea  Grant  programs

currently  form  regional  and  national  partnerships  in  a  limited  capacity  due  to  con-
straints of the matching requirement. We recognize the significance of the matching
requirement,  as  it  ensures  we  leverage  significant  funds  from  each  federal  dollar
that  is  invested;  however,  the  requirement  has,  at  times,  made  it  difficult  to  form
regional  and  national  partnerships  and  interagency  collaborations.  This  change
would  enhance  the  ability  of  the  State  programs  to  form  effective  and  lasting  stra-
tegic  partnerships.  Currently,  Sea  Grant  cannot  provide  significant  funding  to  po-
tential  partners  without  match.  This  becomes  an  obstacle  to  forming  partnerships
when potential partners (i.e., local and State agencies, private partners) do not have
matching funds available. By exempting these activities from the matching require-
ment,  Sea  Grant  programs  would  be  able  to  collaborate  with  a  broader  array  of
partners to address issues such climate change impacts on coastal communities and
ecosystems,  sustainable  development,  fisheries,  hazard  resilience,  and  invasive  spe-
cies—issues that are best addressed regionally and nationally.

In general, the Administration’s proposed reauthorization bill and H.R. 5618 have
more  similarities  than  differences.  The  reauthorization  of  Sea  Grant  is  important
to  NOAA  as  we  continue  to  understand,  assess,  develop,  utilize  and  conserve  our
coastal  and  Great  Lakes  resources.  We  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Sub-
committee  on  Energy  and  Environment  as  the  legislation  moves  through  Congress.

Conclusion

In  summary,  Sea  Grant  is  working  to  realize  its  vision  for  a  future  where  people
live along our coasts in harmony with the natural resources that attracted and con-
tinue  to  sustain  them.  This  is  a  vision  of  our  nation’s  coasts  in  which  we  use  our
natural  resources  in  ways  that  capture  the  economic  and  recreational  benefits  they
offer,  while  preserving  their  quality  and  abundance  for  future  generations.  This
work allows Sea Grant to serve NOAA’s mission goal to protect, restore and manage
the use of coastal and ocean resources effectively.

Sea  Grant  has  demonstrated  an  ability  to  leverage  resources  and  engage  issues
in  partnership  with  other  entities;  this  program  has  proven  itself  to  be  an  effective
investment  of  taxpayer  dollars.  Looking  ahead,  the  Sea  Grant  network  of  univer-
sities  provides  a  national  infrastructure  with  the  ability  to  adapt  and  respond  to
emerging issues. I look forward to working with you to ensure that the National Sea
Grant College Program continues to generate practical solutions to real problems in
real places.

Thank you for inviting me to testify on the National Sea Grant College Program.
I  thank  you  also  for  your  interest  in  and  support  of  NOAA’s  National  Sea  Grant
College Program.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  PAUL  S.  ANDERSON,  PRESIDENT,  SEA
GRANT  ASSOCIATION;  DIRECTOR,  MAINE  SEA  GRANT  COL-
LEGE PROGRAM
Mr.  ANDERSON.  Good  morning,  Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking
Member  Inglis  and  Committee  Members.  My  name  is  Paul  Ander-
son. I am the Director of the Maine Sea Grant College Program at
the  University  of  Maine  and  I  appear  today  on  behalf  of  the  Sea
Grant Association in my capacity as president to offer our perspec-
tive on H.R. 5618.

It is an honor to represent the nationwide network of Sea Grant
colleges  at  this  hearing,  and  it  is  with  great  appreciation  that  we
acknowledge  your  leadership  and  the  Subcommittee’s  long  history
of support for the National Sea Grant College Program.

I have a formal statement that I ask to be included in the record
for  this  hearing.  The  SGA,  Sea  Grant  Association,  represents  the
combined  capabilities  of  over  300  university  and  research  institu-
tions  nationwide  in  the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program.  The
SGA enables these institutions to coordinate their activities and to
prioritize  action  at  the  regional  and  national  levels  and  offers  a
unified voice on critical coastal ocean and Great Lakes issues.

Just  as  our  nation’s  land  grant  institutions  have  revolutionized
agriculture,  so  too  are  the  Sea  Grant  colleges  steering  our  nation
toward the productive and sustainable use of our coastal ocean and
Great  Lakes  resources  through  integrated  and  competitive  pro-
grams  of  scientific  research,  education,  training  and  technical  as-
sistance.

I  want  to  start  by  providing  an  example,  if  I  might,  from  my
home  State  of  Maine  on  how  the  Sea  Grant  program  has  signifi-
cantly  contributed  towards  a  sustainable  environment  and  econ-
omy.  I  think  you  might  find  this  story  interesting.  Like  many  of
our  coastal  states,  Maine  is  a  seafood  producing  state,  and  with
both  wild  capture  and  cultured  fish  and  shellfish.  Also  like  many
coastal  states,  Maine  is  a  popular  destination  for  visitors  with  a
significant  tourism  industry.  The  Sea  Grant  program  has  been
working  nationally  with  these  two  very  large  economic  sectors  to
ensure compatibility and economic success for both.

There  are,  however,  challenges  between  these  sectors  and  con-
flicts  between  them,  and  I  would  like  to  tell  you  about  an  innova-
tive  solution  to  a  conflict  between  the  recreational  boating  or  sail-
ing community, and part of the Maine industry that wants to grow
blue  mussels.  You  have  all  enjoyed  blue  mussels  perhaps  on  your
dinner  plate.  When  this  grower  proposed  to  put  his  growing  oper-
ation, a floating raft structure, in the vicinity of where the boating
community  does  much  of  their  sailing,  they  called  Sea  Grant  be-
cause  it  was  an  issue.  We  brought  the  conflicting  parties  together
along  with  a  mechanical  engineer  from  the  University  and  we
helped  to  develop  a  device  that  allows  the  raft  structure  to  sink
below the water level on demand and then, with the push of a but-
ton,  to  return  the  structure  to  the  surface  and  harvest  and  main-
tain the operation, out of sight, out of mind, so to speak. Much like
your garage door opener, the device now has a patent pending and
the  periodic  regattas  in  that  area  continue.  This  is  just  one  exam-
ple  of  how  Sea  Grant  operates  as  an  honest  broker,  bringing  to-

gether  varying  needs  and  perspectives  and  applying  science  and
creativity to identify collaborative solutions to complex problems.

It  is  an  unrealized  potential  of  Sea  Grant,  as  illustrated  by  this
example, that provides the context for our comments on H.R. 5618.
The  SGA  strongly  endorses  the  intent  and  many  of  the  proposed
changes  contained  in  H.R.  5618,  and  we  pledge  to  do  our  part  to
help towards the bill’s enactment.

First, we support the adjustments offered in H.R. 5618 regarding
program ranking and performance assessment and response to the
NRC,  the  National  Research  Council’s  report  that  you  just  heard
about. We are also pleased with the bill’s emphasis on regional col-
laboration. We are particularly pleased to see that the bill provides
enhanced flexibility in the allocation and overall management of re-
sources within the program and which will allow for both program
stability  and  our  responsiveness.  I  think  it  is  the  responsiveness
that  is  really  something  that  is  particularly  keen  with  the  Sea
Grant  program.  And  we  strongly  support  the  language  of  the  Sea
Grant  planning  and  priority-setting  process  to  the  interagency
Ocean Research Priorities Plan, as was also just described.

However,  we  do  have  one  concern  and  that  is  the  authorization
level  that  is  contained  in  H.R.  5618.  It  represents  a  significant  re-
duction,  perhaps  up  to  33  percent  compared  to  Sea  Grant’s  fiscal
year  2008,  or  current,  authorization  levels.  Funding  for  the  Sea
Grant  program  has  not  kept  pace,  as  you  mentioned  earlier,  Mr.
Chairman, with the extraordinary growth in coastal population and
development  and  the  resulting  increasing  demands  on  our  pro-
gramming.  At  the  current  fiscal  year  2009  level  proposed  by  the
Administration  for  the  Sea  Grant  program,  we  would  be  asked  to
operate  at  its  lowest  level  in  a  42-year  history.  So  I  said  all  that
to say that we do feel that these declining trends in appropriations
would  be  exacerbated  by  a  parallel  reduction  in  our  authorization
levels and we hope the Committee will consider that.

We  recommend—the  SGA  recommends  that  the  National  Sea
Grant  College  Program  be  reauthorized  at  levels  that  would  grow
to  $125  million  by  the  year  2014.  With  this,  Sea  Grant  would  be
better  positioned  to  address  a  number  of  critical  coastal  issues  in-
cluding  coastal  hazard  resiliency,  sustainable  coastal  development,
the health of our coastal ecosystems and sustainable seafood. These
are  the  four  focus  areas  of  our  current  and  future  strategic  plan.
To  conclude,  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  the
Sea  Grant  Association  has  a  vision  for  the  Sea  Grant  College  Pro-
gram  to  become  NOAA’s  primary  university-based  research,  edu-
cation  and  technical  assistance  program  in  support  of  marine  re-
source  management  and  conservation.  We  believe  that  H.R.  5618
moves Sea Grant in that direction and we are supportive of the bill
in many ways and will work to support its enactment.

Thank  you  for  your  time  today,  and  I  would  be  glad  to  answer

any questions.

My  name  is  Paul  Anderson.  I  am  the  Director  of  the  Maine  Sea  Grant  College
Program in Orono, Maine; but I appear today as President of the Sea Grant Associa-
tion (SGA).

It  is  an  honor  to  represent  the  nationwide  network  of  Sea  Grant  professionals  at
this  hearing,  and  it  is  with  great  appreciation  that  we—all  of  us  in  the  Sea  Grant
Association—acknowledge  this  subcommittee’s  long  history  of  support  for  the  Na-
tional  Sea  Grant  College  Program.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  express  these
views  regarding  to  the  reauthorization  of  the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program.
The Sea Grant Association (SGA) represents the combined capabilities of over 300
university and research institutions nationwide that participate in the National Sea
Grant  College  Program.  The  SGA  enables  these  institutions  to  coordinate  their  ac-
tivities, to prioritize action at the regional and national levels, and to offer a unified
voice  on  critical  coastal,  ocean,  and  Great  Lakes  issues.  Just  as  our  nation’s  Land
Grant institutions have revolutionized agriculture, so too are the Sea Grant Colleges
steering  our  nation  toward  the  productive  and  sustainable  use  of  our  coastal,  oce-
anic,  and  Great  Lakes  resources  through  integrated  and  competitive  programs  of
scientific research, education, training, and technical assistance.

The  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  (Sea  Grant)  was  last  reauthorized  six
years  ago,  after  extensive  review  and  with  overwhelming  support  by  both  Houses
of  Congress,  through  the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  Amendments  Act  of
2002 (P.L. 107–299).

The  SGA  strongly  endorses  the  intent  and  many  of  the  proposed  changes  con-
tained  within  the  Sea  Grant  reauthorization  bill  that  is  currently  being  considered
before this subcommittee, the National Sea Grant College Program Amendments Act
of 2008 (H.R. 5618). Over the last several months, the SGA and members of the Na-
tional  Sea  Grant  Review  Panel  have  discussed  many  of  the  issues  associated  with
reauthorization. As a result of that process, we reached a substantial amount of con-
sensus  and  we  are  pleased  that  much  of  that  consensus  is  reflected  in  H.R.  5618.

We specifically support the way the bill addresses the following issues:

• Adjustments  in  the  rating  and  ranking  process  which  were  part  of  the  last

reauthorization bill;

• Additional emphasis on regional collaboration;
• Enhanced  flexibility  in  the  management  and  resource  allocations  within  the

program;

• Strengthening  of  the  review  process  consistent  with  the  recommendations

made by the National Academy of Sciences; and

• Linkage  of  the  Sea  Grant  strategic  planning  and  priority  setting  process  to
the  overarching  interagency  ocean  research  priorities  and  implementation
plan1 released in January 2007 by the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science
and Technology.

However,  we  are  concerned  that  the  authorization  levels  contained  in  H.R.  5618
represent a significant reduction (of more than 33 percent) compared to the author-
ization  levels  included  in  current  law  for  fiscal  year  2008  (P.L.  107–299),  and  fall
short of what is needed to address the ever-increasing needs and opportunities that
our  nation’s  coastal,  ocean,  and  Great  Lakes  resources  present.  Several  coastal  re-
gions  under  U.S.  jurisdiction  have  limited  or  no  Sea  Grant  program  coverage  at
present,  and  there  are  significant  stretches  of  the  U.S.  coastline  that  receive  little
or no attention from our on-the-ground Sea Grant Extension network of agents and
specialists.  Additionally,  existing  coastal  and  Great  Lakes  Sea  Grant  programs  re-
ceive many more high quality and user-driven projects than they can fund.

Therefore, we would like to offer our perspective on the funding needs for this im-
portant  national  program.  The  SGA  recommends  that  the  National  Sea  Grant  Col-
lege  Program  be  reauthorized  at  a  level  of  funding  that  grows  to  $125  million  by
FY  2014.  This  will  enable  Sea  Grant  to  support  a  robust,  competitive,  merit-based
research program tied to extension, communication, and education in which science-
based information is used to address societal problems and opportunities as they re-
late  to  management,  conservation,  and  sustainable  use  of  our  coastal,  marine,  and
Great Lakes resources.

The Public Policy Context for Ocean and Coastal Issues

21

The  interface  between  science  and  policy  is  precisely  where  the  Sea  Grant  pro-
gram  applies  its  precious  resources.  As  the  program  makes  decisions  on  funding  of
research  and  outreach  projects,  issues  that  are  acutely  important  to  Sea  Grant’s
local, regional, and national constituencies receive priority attention. Extension and
educational  resources  are  deployed  in  ways  that  enhance  the  relevance  and  impact
of the science and discoveries that result from Sea Grant-funded research.

There  is  a  growing  demand  from  our  diverse  network  of  stakeholders,  resource
managers,  and  decision-makers  for  scientifically-sound  information  upon  which
sound  decisions  addressing  many  of  today’s  complex  problems  can  be  made.  Sea
Grant’s integrated science and outreach approach incorporates up-to-date and ongo-
ing dialogue with its constituencies to identify the most important and timely issues
of  national  importance  facing  our  communities,  states  and  regions.  Technological
and  scientific  approaches,  though  desirable,  cannot  solve  all  of  society’s  problems,
and Sea Grant’s ability to embed itself within the communities it serves enables the
program to interact directly with people who live, work, and play along our nation’s
coastal  regions,  thereby  ensuring  that  the  utility  and  impact  of  investments  made
by the Sea Grant program are relevant and significant. Sea Grant’s work is always
fresh. Although the program has been in place for more than 40 years, Sea Grant’s
constant attention to societal needs through stakeholder interactions allows it to be
nimble and responsive, while also maintaining the rigor and reliability of a strategic
enterprise.

An increased investment in Sea Grant is an investment in America’s economic fu-
ture.  Attempts  to  balance  our  booming  coastal  economy  with  its  associated  impacts
on  the  coastal  and  marine  environment  upon  which  it  depends  have  raised  the
stakes for effective government action. The coastal regions of the United States con-
tribute more than 50 percent of the Nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accord-
ing  to  a  recent  study  by  the  Federal  Reserve.  The  oceans,  in  one  way  or  another,
account  for  one  out  of  every  six  jobs  nationwide.  Tax  revenues  in  coastal  areas  are
among the fastest growing revenue sources for State and local governments. In fact,
the  collective  economic  impact  of  the  coastal  economy  far  exceeds  U.S.  agriculture,
and  yet  federal  investments  in  Sea  Grant  colleges  and  universities  are  an  order  of
magnitude  smaller  than  investments  in  the  Land  Grant  college  and  university  sys-
tem funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for land-based activities, the pro-
gram on which Sea Grant was modeled.

In more recent years, the work of two major national commissions2 have brought
into focus the importance of our oceans and coasts to our nation’s natural heritage,
security, and economy. With an offshore ocean jurisdiction larger than the total land
mass  of  the  United  States,  U.S.  waters  support  rich  and  diverse  systems  of  ocean
life, provide a protective buffer, and support important commerce, trade, energy, and
mineral resources.

• More  than  $1  trillion,  or  one-tenth,  of  the  Nation’s  annual  GDP  is  generated
within near-shore areas, the relatively narrow strip of land immediately adja-
cent  to  the  coast.  Looking  at  all  coastal  watershed  counties,  the  contribution
swells to over $6.1 trillion, more than half of the Nation’s GDP;

• In  2003,  ocean-related  economic  activity  contributed  more  than  $119  billion
to  American  prosperity  and  supported  over  2.2  million  jobs.  Roughly  three-
quarters  of  the  jobs  and  half  the  economic  value  were  produced  by  ocean-re-
lated  tourism  and  recreation.  More  than  13  million  jobs  are  related  to  trade
transported  by  the  network  of  inland  waterways  and  ports  that  support  U.S.
waterborne commerce;

• Annually, the Nation’s ports handle more than $700 billion in goods, and the

cruise industry and its passengers account for $11 billion in spending;

• The  commercial  fishing  industry’s  total  value  exceeds  $28  billion  annually,
with the recreational saltwater fishing industry valued at around $20 billion,
and the annual U.S. retail trade in ornamental fish worth another $3 billion;
and

• Nationwide retail expenditures on recreational boating exceeded $30 billion in

2002.

Sea Grant’s Place in the Public Policy Context

Sea  Grant  is  an  important  federal  program  that  assists  decision-makers  in  ad-
dressing  these  increasingly  pressing  issues.  Sea  Grant  is  a  productive  and  effective
federal-State-university  partnership  which  supports  competitive,  merit-based,  and
integrated research, education, and extension programs at many of our nation’s out-
standing  university  and  research  institutions.  Over  300  institutions  and  more  than
3,000  scientists,  engineers,  educators,  students,  and  outreach  experts  participate  in
the  program  each  year.  Sea  Grant  provides  its  constituents  with  relevant  science-
based information and technical assistance that addresses ocean, coastal, and Great
Lakes resource issues and opportunities of national significance at the national, re-
gional,  State,  and  local  levels.  Sea  Grant  thus  supports  the  mission  of  its  parent
agency—the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)—as well as
the  needs  of  ocean,  coastal  and  Great  Lakes  communities,  with  an  overall  goal  of
fostering economic and environmental sustainability on a national level.

This successful partnership program, in which the federal contribution is matched
with  non-federal  resources  on  a  two  to  one  basis,  relies  on  stakeholder  engagement
to ensure that Sea Grant resources are deployed strategically and that outcomes are
relevant.  Sea  Grant  emphasizes  the  application  of  objective,  science-based  informa-
tion and collaborative problem-solving to address complex societal issues. I have at-
tached a list of users, stakeholders, and beneficiaries that attest to the value of the
products and services produced via the Sea Grant program.

Sea Grant Is Under Budgetary Stress

The  growth  of  the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  has  not  been  commensu-
rate with the extraordinary growth in coastal population and development, and the
concomitant increase in demands for Sea Grant program services by our coastal con-
stituents.  In  fact,  the  Sea  Grant  budget  has  not  kept  pace  with  inflation  over  the
last two decades, much less expanded to meet the wealth of new challenges and op-
portunities that face our country.

The FY 2008 budget for the Sea Grant program is $57.1 million. The Administra-
tion’s  budget  request  for  FY  2009  would  reduce  this  national  program  to  $54.997
million—a  four  percent  reduction  at  a  time  when  the  NOAA  budget  as  a  whole  is
proposed  to  grow  by  five  percent.  At  the  level  proposed  by  the  Administration,  the
Sea Grant program would be asked to operate at its lowest level in its 42-year his-
tory  in  real  terms  (see  the  following  chart).  Sea  Grant’s  appropriations  are  over  20
percent below the buying power of its 1980 level and we have seen staff reductions
on the order of 25 percent.

This  decline  in  federal  support  has  had  serious  ramifications  for  the  Sea  Grant
program.  At  present,  only  about  12  percent  of  the  proposals  submitted  to  the  Sea
Grant  program  can  be  funded  due  to  resource  constraints.  In  contrast,  the  success
rate for proposal support at the National Science Foundation is just over 20 percent.
Sea  Grant  directors  estimate  that  they  have  enough  high  quality  meritorious  pro-

23

posals—of importance to the program’s mission and relevant to stakeholder needs—
to fund 25 percent of the proposals submitted.

Currently,  about  $30  million  of  Sea  Grant’s  $57.1  million  budget  is  used  to  sup-
port  research.  The  research  portion  of  the  Sea  Grant  program  budget  could  easily
and justifiably be doubled to between $60 million to $80 million annually to support
important  research  efforts  that  currently  go  unfunded  to  generate  answers  to  the
many  questions  and  provide  new  knowledge  and  technologies  needed  by  ocean  and
coastal  resource  decision-makers,  business  and  industry,  and  coastal  communities.
The balance of the Sea Grant budget supports the program’s extension, education,
and outreach efforts. The uniqueness and success of the Sea Grant program is based
on  its  ability  to  integrate  its  research,  education,  and  extension  efforts,  ensuring
that  research  results  are  intimately  tied  to  the  needs  of  our  citizens.  The  current
level  of  expenditure  for  extension,  communication,  and  education  in  the  Sea  Grant
program  is  approximately  $25  million.  A  recent  report  of  the  NOAA  Science  Advi-
sory  Board3 called  on  NOAA  to  substantially  expand  its  extension,  outreach,  and
education activities. Sea Grant has the experience and the ‘‘on-the-ground’’ network
to fulfill that policy recommendation immediately if sufficient additional budget sup-
port  from  NOAA  was  forthcoming.  As  Sea  Grant’s  research  program  expands  to
meet  increasing  demands,  so  too  must  the  tools  that  put  these  research  results  in
the  hands  of  stakeholders  so  that  they  can  be  utilized.  The  Sea  Grant  extension,
communication,  and  education  function  should  therefore  likewise  be  increased  com-
mensurate  with  increased  research  funding  to  between  $40  million  to  $50  million
to maintain this critical balance of Sea Grant program support.

Sea Grant’s Alignment with Federal Interagency Ocean Research Priorities
Another  justification  for  increased  federal  support  for  Sea  Grant’s  core  functions
relate  to  the  recommendations  put  forth  in  recent  ocean,  coastal,  and  Great  Lakes
policy and planning activities in NOAA and other federal agencies. In January 2007,
the  Federal  Government  released  its  interagency  ocean  research  priorities  plan,  ti-
tled Charting the Course for Ocean Science in the United States for the Next Decade:
An  Ocean  Research  Priorities  Plan  and  Implementation  Strategy.  That  document
lays  out  the  key  priorities  for  interagency  ocean  research  over  the  next  ten  years.
Priorities identified in that report include:

• Stewardship  of  Natural  and  Cultural  Ocean  Resources—which  includes  ef-
forts involving sustainable resources, such as fisheries and alternative energy
sources, and non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels and minerals;

• Increasing  Coastal  Community  Resilience  to  Natural  Hazards—including  re-
search and education into causes, impacts, and the adaptation and mitigation
from  natural  physical  hazards,  such  as  hurricanes  and  tsunamis,  community
and ecosystem vulnerability, and hazard mitigation;

• Enabling Marine Operations—which includes efforts to determine the impacts
of  marine  operations,  including  transportation,  energy  exploration  and  devel-
opment,  and  aquaculture,  on  the  environment;  and  the  impacts  of  the  envi-
ronment on marine operations;
• The Ocean’s Role in Climate—to examine the impact of climate change on our
ocean and coastal regions, understanding changes and impacts on ecosystems
particularly  on  a  regional  basis  so  as  to  better  prepare  national,  State,  local,
and  regional  decision-makers  to  adapt  and  mitigate  to  regional  climate
change challenges;
• Improving  Ecosystem  Health—which  examines  natural  and  human-induced
changes  and  impacts  to  ecosystems  and  methods  to  monitor  and  address  im-
pacts; and
• Enhancing Human Health—which is a focus on efforts to identify and assess
ocean-related risks to human health and identify and develop ocean products
for human well-being.

Common among these themes is the need to develop tools necessary to pursue re-
search and to effectively translate the results of that research in ways that are use-
ful  to  resource  managers,  policy-makers,  and  the  general  public.  Society’s  ability  to
fully  develop  the  understanding  needed  to  address  key  ocean  and  coastal-related
issues  and  to  apply  existing  understanding  to  support  meaningful  decision-making
and ocean literacy depends on the generation of science-based information, develop-

ment  of  technology,  and  continued  intellectual  innovation—three  key  functions  of
the Sea Grant program.

Consistent  with  the  overarching  interagency  ocean  research  priorities  report  and
as a result of its on-going strategic planning process, Sea Grant has honed its stra-
tegic  programmatic  efforts  to  emphasize  the  following  focus  areas  in  the  coming
years:

• Sustainable  Coastal  Development—Decades  of  population  migration  to  the
coast have transformed our coastal landscapes and greatly intensified demand
on  finite  coastal  resources.  New  housing  developments,  recreation  facilities,
energy  development  activities,  port  expansions  and  other  business  activities
are  bringing  more  people,  jobs  and  recreational  opportunities  to  coastal  com-
munities.  They  are  also  increasing  the  pressure  on  coastal  lands,  water  sup-
ply, traditional coastal businesses, and on the coastal culture and way of life.
To accommodate more people and activity and resolve the growing number of
conflicts,  we  must  develop  new  policies  and  management  approaches  to  bal-
ance  the  conservation  and  use  of  coastal,  ocean  and  Great  Lakes  resources.
Sea Grant’s well-established role as an honest broker and source of unbiased
information  make  it  a  key  player  in  responding  to  the  needs  for  sound  infor-
mation identified by decision-makers, for convening stakeholders to seek com-
mon ground, and for facilitating the development and implementation of new
coastal policies, plans, management approaches, and conflict resolution strate-
gies related to sustainable coastal and economic development.
• Healthy Coastal Ecosystems—Intensified development along the coast and re-
lated  human  activities  are  leading  to  water  quality  degradation,  wetlands
loss,  invasive  species,  and  a  host  of  other  challenges  that  need  to  be  under-
stood and addressed in order to restore and maintain healthy ecosystems that
are the foundation for quality-of-life of our citizens and for economic develop-
ment along the Nation’s coasts. Ecosystem-based management, reduction and
mitigation of anthropogenic impacts, protection of critical areas, and regional
habitat  restoration  are  some  of  the  avenues  that  must  be  addressed  to  meet
these challenges. Sea Grant’s research, education and outreach initiatives can
continue to play a major role in building our understanding of how these nat-
ural  systems  function,  in  advancing  regional  problem  solving,  and  in  sup-
porting resource managers and decision-makers at all levels of government in
moving  toward  an  ecosystem-based  approach  to  managing  coastal,  ocean  and
Great Lakes resources.
• Coastal Hazard Resiliency—Global warming, sea level rise, increased number
and  intensity  of  coastal  storms,  and  other  climate-  and  weather-related  phe-
nomena  are  putting  more  people  and  property  at  risk  along  the  Nation’s
coasts  with  major  implications  for  human  safety,  ecosystem  health,  and  the
economic vitality of our coastal communities. It is essential that residents and
leaders  in  coastal  communities  understand  these  risks,  learn  what  they  can
do  to  reduce  their  vulnerability,  and  respond  quickly  and  effectively  to  these
events.  Sea  Grant—with  its  strong  research,  education,  and  outreach  capac-
ity—can play a major role in developing tools and technologies for disaster re-
siliency  and  in  assisting  local  citizens,  decision-makers,  and  businesses  plan,
prepare,  respond,  and  rebuild  in  the  face  of  these  short-  and  long-term  haz-
ards events.
• Sustainable  Safe  Seafood  Supply—The  U.S.  has  witnessed  the  decline  of
many  of  its  major  fisheries  at  the  same  time  that  seafood  consumption  is  on
the  rise,  resulting  in  a  seafood  trade  deficit  of  about  $9  billion  a  year.  Over-
fishing,  habitat  degradation,  and  increasing  competition  among  coastal  users
have  put  our  nation’s  fishing  industry  in  great  jeopardy.  Seafood  safety  is  a
growing  concern  as  international  trade  increases  and  fish  diseases  and  con-
tamination  become  bigger  problems.  Aquaculture  is  opening  up  new  opportu-
nities to meet the growing domestic seafood demand, but it must be conducted
in a sustainable and economically viable manner in order for its full potential
to be realized. Sea Grant continues to play a key role in advancing our under-
standing of the nature of these problems and opportunities and in employing
its  research,  education,  and  extension  capabilities  to  support  informed  public
and  private  decision-making  and  resource  management  activities  that  will
lead to an enhanced, sustainable supply of safe seafood into the future.

university-based  research,  education,  extension  and  outreach,  and  technical  assist-
ance program for coastal, marine, and Great Lakes resources.

The  Sea  Grant  program—with  its  excellent  track  record,  its  distributed  network,
its  objective  approach  to  problem-solving,  its  strong  integrity-backed  ties  to  hun-
dreds  of  stakeholders  all  across  the  country,  its  integrated  approach  that  ensures
its  research  efforts  are  tied  to  serving  the  needs  of  national,  State,  regional,  and
local decision-makers, and a revamped strategic planning and programmatic review
process—is  uniquely  positioned  to  meet  the  growing  needs  of  the  Nation  in  imple-
menting  its  ocean,  coast,  and  Great  Lakes  agenda.  To  do  so,  based  on  current  and
emerging  requirements  we  believe  it  is  in  the  national  interest  to  enhance  the  Na-
tional Sea Grant College Program to a level of $125 million by fiscal year 2014.

Sea  Grant’s  strategic  planning  efforts  and  rigorous  program  evaluation  processes
foster excellence and accountability. Coupled with an updated authorization that re-
flects  and  supports  the  real  needs  of  the  program,  Sea  Grant  can  continue  and  ex-
pand its efforts to address an ever-increasing suite of resource issues facing the Na-
tion’s coastal areas, foster innovative economic development efforts, and educate and
train the Nation’s future coastal, ocean, and Great Lakes workforce.

We  believe  that  H.R.  5618  moves  the  Sea  Grant  program  in  that  direction  and
we  are  supportive  of  the  bill  in  many  ways  and  will  work  in  support  of  its  enact-
ment. We believe it is important, however, for the Congress to provide the National
Sea  Grant  College  Program  with  resources  necessary  to  build  on  the  program’s
record of success and promise with a reauthorization of appropriations that matches
both the immediate and long-term needs of all who live and work along the Nation’s
coastlines, and one that represents the initial step in achieving a broader vision for
the program as proposed in this testimony.

The  SGA  looks  forward  to  working  with  you  this  year  on  Sea  Grant  reauthoriza-
tion. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify on behalf of all of the Sea Grant
Colleges  nationwide.  I  would  be  glad  to  address  any  questions  the  Subcommittee
may have.

The Sea Grant Association is a non-profit organization dedicated to furthering the
Sea  Grant  program  concept.  The  SGA’s  regular  membership  consists  of  the  institu-
tions that participate in the National Sea Grant College Program, located within the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). SGA provides the mech-
anism  for  these  institutions  to  coordinate  their  activities,  to  set  program  priorities
at both the regional and national level, and to provide a unified voice for these insti-
tutions on issues of importance to the oceans, coasts and Great Lakes. The SGA ad-
vocates  for  greater  understanding,  use,  and  conservation  of  marine,  coastal  and
Great Lakes resources.

STATEMENT OF MR. M. RICHARD DEVOE, EXECUTIVE

DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA SEA GRANT CONSORTIUM

Mr.  DEVOE.  Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  Mem-
bers  of  the  Subcommittee  and  staff,  it  is  my  pleasure  to  be  here
with  you  this  morning.  Good  morning.  My  name  is  Rick  DeVoe.  I
am  Executive  Director  of  the  South  Carolina  Sea  Grant  Consor-
tium.  I  also  want  to  offer  my  great  appreciation  to  this  sub-
committee  and  to  the  Committee  in  general  for  the  support  of  the
Committee for Sea Grant and the National Sea Grant College Pro-
gram.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  be  here  and  express  my
views  from  a  State  and  regional  perspective  regarding  H.R.  5618,
the reauthorization of the National Sea Grant College Program.

The  South  Carolina  Sea  Grant  Consortium  is  one  of  31  univer-
sity-based  Sea  Grant  programs  that  work  with  coastal  commu-
nities,  business  and  industry,  educational  institutions,  nonprofits
and others to generate and deliver user-driven, science-based infor-
mation  on  coastal  and  marine  resource  development,  management
and conservation throughout the Nation. The Consortium in South
Carolina  consists  of  eight  member  institutions:  The  Citadel,
Clemson  University,  Coastal  Carolina  University,  the  College  of
Charleston, the Medical University of South Carolina, South Caro-
lina  Department  of  Natural  Resources,  the  South  Carolina  State
University,  which  is  our  MSI  university  in  the  state,  and  the  Uni-
versity  of  South  Carolina.  They  all  provide  the  scientific  and  tech-
nical  expertise,  facilities  and  training  to  address  coastal  and  ma-
rine  resource  issues  and  opportunities  in  my  state  and  indeed  re-
gion-wide.  The  Sea  Grant  program  nationally  does  represent  more
than 300 universities at any one time in engaging them in dealing
with  issues  that  we  face  on  a  day-to-day  basis  along  our  coasts,
oceans and Great Lakes.

I  have  been  the  Consortium’s  director  since  1997.  However,  I
have been with South Carolina Sea Grant since 1980 upon gradua-
tion  from  the  University  of  Rhode  Island.  My  comments  today  re-
flect  my  experience  from  insights  gained  through  my  work  at  the
national,  regional  and  State  levels.  I  want  to  start  by  giving  one
example  of  many  that  I  have  included  in  my  written  testimony  of
Sea  Grant’s  effectiveness  in  South  Carolina  and  in  the  region  and
focus  on  an  example  from  the  upstate  of  South  Carolina,  if  I  may.
Recognizing  that  the  influence  of  the  oceans  extends  well  inland
from the coast and that activities in upland areas can have impacts
on  the  coast,  the  Consortium  awarded  a  small  grant  to  the  Roper
Mountain Science Center in Greenville, South Carolina, in the mid-
1980s  to  assemble  a  touch  tank  so  that  children  in  the  upstate
could  become  more  familiar  with  sea  life.  According  to  the  Center,
this modest investment by Sea Grant led ultimately to the develop-
ment of the marine and ecology labs at the Center. In 2006, Roper
Mountain Science Center had over 90,000 students and over 20,000
attended  lessons  in  the  natural  science  building,  which  houses  the
two labs. And last year, the Consortium supported a grant for edu-
cation  presentation  equipment  needed  for  lessons  in  the  new  ma-
rine  lab.  I  have  attached  a  letter  from  the  Center  to  my  written
testimony,  that  provides  additional  details  about  this  partnership.
So my message here is that Sea Grant is a coastal and marine pro-
gram  but  it  certainly  does  extend  its  reach  well  inland  from  the
coast and affects a lot of lives and activities.

As a Sea Grant Program Director, I want to state that I strongly
support  the  intent  and  many  of  the  proposed  changes  contained
within  the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  Amendments  Act
of 2008 in H.R. 5618. I am not going to be redundant with my col-
league  to  my  right  but  we,  again  from  a  State  and  regional  per-
spective,  endorse  provisions  of  the  bill  that  do  make  significant
modifications  to  the  rating  and  ranking  program.  This  has  con-
strained  competition—excuse  me—it  has  created  competition
among  our  programs  as  opposed  to  fostering  program  excellence
throughout  the  country.  It  includes  provisions  that  would  actually
enhance Sea Grant’s ability to work at a regional level. We do have
our  footprints  at  the  State  level  but  this  provides  an  opportunity
for  us  to  further  formalize  regional  partnerships  in  line,  for  in-
stance,  with  various  alliances  that  have  been  created  around  the
country  with  governors  and  the  states,  in  the  West  Coast,  for  in-
stance, in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere.

It  provides  an  authorization  of  overall  base  funding  for  Sea
Grant  which  allows  for  program  flexibility,  as  Paul  Anderson  had
mentioned,  and  we  are  now  better  tied  with  this  bill  to  the  prior-
ities  of  the  national  level  in  terms  of  research  and  outreach  for
coastal ocean and Great Lakes resources.

I  indeed,  again  from  the  State  level,  want  to  echo  our  concerns
about  the  authorization  levels  in  the  bill.  They  are  much  lower
than  they  are  currently  and  there  could  be  a  perception  that  with
that  reduction  in  authorization  levels  that  there  may  be  less  con-
fidence in the program. I would hope that we don’t think that way
and we would like to be able to feel that we could obtain those lev-
els  actually  under  the  current  situation,  that  we  might  be  able  to
obtain those levels in the future.

I  would  like  to  end  my  presentation  with  my  thoughts  on  why
I  feel  the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  is  uniquely  posi-
tioned  to  address  many  coastal  marine  challenges  and  opportuni-
ties that we face. Sea Grant is by definition a federal-State-univer-
sity partnership. Sea Grant employs integrated research, education
and  extension  program  that  makes  us  unique  in  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment.  Sea  Grant  addresses  real  problems  and  opportunities  for
real  people.  We  work  in  response  to  the  needs  and  opportunities
that  are  presented  to  us.  Sea  Grant  works  at  many  geographic
scales,  and  we  can  do  that  now  and  we  can  do  that  within  en-
hanced support. Sea Grant is seen by its constituencies as an hon-
est  broker,  which  allows  us  to  get  into  discussions  that  otherwise
we  may  not  be  there  and  help  foster  decisions  and  outcomes,  and
Sea Grant leverages significant resources.

To  conclude,  I  believe  that  H.R.  5618  moves  Sea  Grant  in  the
right  direction.  It  is  important,  however,  that  Sea  Grant  be  pro-
vided with the resources it needs to meet the ever-increasing chal-
lenges ahead.

Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I will be glad
to  address  any  questions  the  Subcommittee  may  have.  Thank  you.

[The prepared statement of Mr. DeVoe follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF M. RICHARD DEVOE

Chairman Lampson, Ranking Member Inglis, and Members of the Subcommittee:

My name is M. Richard DeVoe. I am the Executive Director of the South Carolina
Sea  Grant  Consortium.  It  is  an  honor  to  be  with  you  this  morning,  and  it  is  with
great appreciation that I and my Sea Grant colleagues acknowledge your leadership
and  this  subcommittee’s  support  for  the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program.
Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  express  my  views,  from  a  State  and  regional  per-
spective, regarding H.R. 5618, the reauthorization of the National Sea Grant College
Program.

The S.C. Sea Grant Consortium is one of 31 university-based Sea Grant programs
that work with coastal communities, business and industry, educational institutions,
non-profits,  and  others  to  generate  and  deliver  user-driven,  science-based  informa-
tion on coastal and marine resource development, management, and conservation to
our diverse and ever-growing constituencies throughout the Nation. The Consortium
consists  of  eight  member  institutions—The  Citadel,  Clemson  University,  Coastal
Carolina  University,  College  of  Charleston,  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,
South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, South Carolina State University,
and University of South Carolina—which provide the scientific and technical exper-
tise,  facilities,  and  training  to  address  coastal  and  marine  resource  issues  and  op-
portunities in our state and region.

I have been the Consortium’s Director since 1997; however, I have been with S.C.
Sea  Grant  since  1980  upon  graduation  from  the  University  of  Rhode  Island.  I  have
also  been  actively  involved  with  the  Sea  Grant  network  through  the  Sea  Grant  As-
sociation, having served as its President in 2001 and 2002, and as chair of its Exter-
nal  Relations  Committee  since  2002.  In  addition,  I  currently  serve  as  chair  of  the
Board of Directors for the SouthEast Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association
(SECOORA), Executive Committee member of the Board on Oceans and Atmosphere
of  the  National  Association  of  State  Universities  and  Land  Grant  Colleges
(NASULGC), and South Carolina representative on the Consortium for Ocean Lead-
ership. At the State level, I am a member of the Board of Directors for The Noisette
Foundation (Charleston, SC), the Slocum-Lunz Foundation, and the Lowcountry In-
stitute  (Spring  Island,  SC),  and  serve  as  Chair  of  the  S.C.  Task  Group  on  Harmful
Algae.  Thus,  my  comments  today  reflect  my  experiences  and  insights  gained
through my work at the national, regional, and State levels.

Views on H.R. 5618

As  a  Sea  Grant  Program  Director,  I  wish  to  state  that  I  strongly  support  the  in-
tent  and  many  of  the  proposed  changes  contained  within  the  National  Sea  Grant
College  Program  Amendments  Act  of  2008  (H.R.  5618).  I  offer  the  following  com-

ments  on  five  provisions  of  the  bill;  four  of  which  are  favorable  and  one  expressing
some concern:
1. Program Evaluation and Assessment

H.R.  5618  makes  significant  modifications  to  the  rating  and  ranking  process
which were added to the Sea Grant statute during the last reauthorization in 2002.
The  requirements  in  Section  3(B)(1)(A)(ii)  of  the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Pro-
gram  Act  Amendments  of  2002  (P.L.  107–299)  have  inadvertently  resulted  in  the
discouragement  of  collaboration  and  reduction  in  sharing  of  ‘‘best  practices’’  among
and  between  State  Sea  Grant  College  programs.  These  requirements  were  initially
developed  to  further  the  competitive  process,  but  in  practice,  they  have  placed  the
State  Sea  Grant  programs  at  odds  with  one  another  at  a  time  when  collaboration
and  partnering,  particularly  on  a  regional  scale,  is  ever  more  important  and  nec-
essary.  Stipulating  that  no  more  than  25  percent  of  the  programs  can  be  ranked
within the top two performance categories is counter-productive to Sea Grant’s goal
of  maintaining  highest  performance  for  all  Sea  Grant  College  programs,  as  well  as
to enhance the sharing of ‘‘best practices.’’

H.R.  5618  replaces  these  requirements.  It  is  important  that  the  Sea  Grant  Col-
leges  function  as  a  nationwide  network—with  strong  encouragement  for  sharing
best practices, research and management results, and outreach and extension activi-
ties.  I  support  the  intent  of  this  bill  in  its  endorsement  of  the  recommendations
made  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  to  strengthen  and  link  the  strategic
planning process of Sea Grant College programs and the Sea Grant program evalua-
tion process. I believe the new evaluation system under development by NOAA with
the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the National Sea Grant Office,
which  will  rate  the  Sea  Grant  College  programs  against  a  set  of  standard  metrics
and  not  against  one  another,  will  result  in  improved  individual  Sea  Grant  College
program  performance  and  regional  collaboration  and  enhanced  information  sharing
among  programs.  This  will  translate  into  more  effective  and  efficient  delivery  of
services and products to Sea Grant’s stakeholders and the Nation’s citizenry.
2. Enhancement of Regional Efforts

H.R. 5618 includes provisions that would complement Sea Grant’s traditional role
at  the  State  and  local  levels  with  regional  efforts.  While  many  of  the  issues  facing
our  coastal  communities  can  only  be  addressed  with  grass-roots  efforts,  emerging
issues related to climate change, sea level rise, ecosystem-based management of liv-
ing  marine  resources,  alternative  ocean  energy  development  (wind,  wave,  and  cur-
rents), among others cry out for a significant investment in integrated regional pro-
grams  to  develop  the  information  base  necessary  to  inform  decision-making,  en-
hance economic growth, conserve living and non-living resources, and enhance pub-
lic awareness. Sea Grant is well-positioned and organized to assume this challenge.
It  has  already  invested  in  the  development  of  regional  ocean  and  coastal  research
plans  across  the  country,  bringing  stakeholders  to  the  table  to  identify  priority
needs,  and  using  the  interagency  Ocean  Research  Priorities  Plan  and  Implementa-
tion Strategy (National Science and Technology Council, January 2007) as the foun-
dation for these discussions. Further, Sea Grant can play a significant role in imple-
menting  these  plans  with  an  additional  investment  of  resources  and  talent;  an  in-
vestment that is matched with contributions from the states and universities. I ap-
plaud  H.R.  5618  for  recognizing  the  importance  of  regional  collaboration  as  a  key
component to the success of the National Sea Grant College Program.
3. Flexibility in Resource Allocation

The current Sea Grant statute (P.L. 107–299) includes within its authorization of
appropriations a line for base funding along with a number of ‘‘Congressional man-
dates’’  for  research  on  zebra  mussels,  oyster  disease  and  restoration,  and  harmful
algal blooms, as well as provides for fisheries extension. The purpose of these man-
dates  in  2002  was  to  ensure  that  Sea  Grant  dollars  were  being  explicitly  used  to
address these topics. While I cannot and will not deny the importance of addressing
the  issues  identified  by  these  mandates,  I  support  the  changes  in  H.R.  5618  to  re-
move these explicit mandates and instead provide an authorization for overall base
funding  for  Sea  Grant.  Providing  one  authorization  for  the  program  as  opposed  to
a  myriad  of  authorizations  gives  the  National  Sea  Grant  Office  enhanced  flexibility
for  the  management  of  Sea  Grant  resources  to  ensure  that  the  most  critical  and
timely  issues  are  subjected  to  the  very  best  science,  education,  and  outreach  given
limited federal dollars. It also provides Sea Grant with the ability and agility to ad-
dress emerging needs and issues much more effectively and efficiently.
4. Linking Sea Grant Priorities to Federal Priorities

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:59 Sep 29, 2008 Jkt 042369 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E08\052108\42369 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

31

H.R.  5618  links  the  Sea  Grant  strategic  planning  and  priority  setting  process  to
the  federal  interagency  Ocean  Research  Priorities  Plan  and  Implementation  Strat-
egy1 released  in  January  2007  by  the  Joint  Subcommittee  on  Ocean  Science  and
Technology.  The  interagency  ocean  research  priorities  plan  was  greatly  informed
and  strengthened  by  State  and  regional  input  provided  by  the  Federal-State  Task
Force  organized  by  the  Subcommittee  on  Integrated  Management  of  Ocean  Re-
sources (SIMOR) of the U.S. Committee on Ocean Policy, on which I was a member.
Linking  Sea  Grant  priorities  to  this  interagency  effort  is  a  significant  change;  one
that will enhance Sea Grant efforts to leverage federal resources to develop and im-
plement  joint  multi-agency  efforts.  I  submit  that  Sea  Grant,  as  a  proven  resource
and  a  successful  federal-State-university  partnership,  should  be  utilized  whenever
possible by the Federal Government to address its national ocean research and out-
reach  priorities;  however,  for  this  to  become  a  reality,  enhanced  federal  investment
in Sea Grant is crucial.
5. Authorization of Appropriations

While  up  to  this  point  I  have  shared  nothing  but  support  for  the  provisions  of
H.R.  5618,  I  would  like  to  register  my  concern  about  Section  10,  Authorization  of
Appropriations.  The  authorization  levels  contained  in  H.R.  5618,  particularly  for
Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2009,  represent  a  significant  reduction  (of  more  than  33  percent)
from Sea Grant’s current (FY 2008) authorization level. While over the last six years
the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  has  not  received  appropriations  that  have
come  close  to  its  authorization  levels,  such  a  significant  reduction  could  be  inter-
preted to say that Sea Grant will never reach such levels of appropriations, and falls
short of what is truly needed to address the ever-increasing needs and opportunities
that  our  nation’s  coastal,  ocean,  and  Great  Lakes  resources  present,  as  articulated
in  the  report  of  the  U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy  (2004),  in  other  recent  anal-
yses, and indeed in H.R. 5618. For these reasons, I ask that the Committee consider
including in H.R. 5618 authorization of appropriations levels that grow to $125 mil-
lion by FY 2014.

The  budgets  of  both  the  National  Sea  Grant  Office  and  the  State  Sea  Grant  pro-
grams were directly impacted by the dramatic reduction of Sea Grant appropriations
(by about 13 percent) starting in FY 2006. Indeed, each of the State Sea Grant pro-
grams  absorbed  a  budget  reduction  of  about  three  (3)  percent  during  the  FY  2007
cycle. The National Sea Grant Office, from what we understand, had to divert fund-
ing  from  national  investments  to  core  Sea  Grant  support  to  help  offset  what  could
have  been  much  more  significant  reductions  in  State  Sea  Grant  program  support.
Exacerbating  this  situation  is  the  fact  that  a  portion  of  each  State  Sea  Grant  pro-
gram  budget  is  devoted  to  core  salaries  and  wages  which,  just  as  with  federal  staff
salaries,  rise  each  year  due  to  cost-of-living  increases;  these  also  have  cut  into  the
programmatic ‘‘buying power’’ of the State Sea Grant programs.

These  impacts  have  begun  to  directly  affect  our  ability  to  deliver  services  to  our
coastal  constituencies  on  a  regular  basis.  Stakeholders  all  over  the  country  have
grown to rely on the high level of service and expertise coming out of the Sea Grant
program.  However,  the  level  of  Sea  Grant  support  has  not  kept  pace  with  the  in-
creasing  pressures  and  needs  of  our  coastal  communities.  In  addition,  the  costs  of
research  and  education  are  rising,  which  under  a  flat  funding  environment  means
that  programs  are  forced  to  reduce  staff  and  leave  numerous  high-quality  research
and  outreach  projects  unfunded.  To  put  it  into  perspective,  Sea  Grant’s  appropria-
tions are more than 20 percent below the buying power of its 1980 level.

The implications for Sea Grant are significant with respect to its ability to signifi-
cantly  contribute  to  the  economic,  environmental,  and  social  well-being  and  health
of  our  coastal  regions.  Currently,  the  Sea  Grant  network  is  severely  strained  and
challenged  to  support  its  current  activities,  staff,  and  operations  with  its  current
budget,  and  has  not  been  able  to  invest  in  new  research,  education,  and  outreach
efforts  to  address  emerging  challenges  in  such  areas  as  regional  climate  change,
coastal  community  resiliency,  and  ecosystem-based  management.  At  present,  only
about  12  percent  of  the  research  proposals  submitted  for  funding  to  the  Sea  Grant
program are funded due to resource constraints. In addition, Sea Grant’s extension,
communication,  and  education  activities  are  in  jeopardy.  A  recent  report  of  the
NOAA  Science  Advisory  Board  recognized  the  value  of  extension,  education,  and
outreach  endeavors  by  NOAA  and  called  for  the  expansion  of  these  activities.  Sea
Grant is the model program for implementing such a request with its broad on-the-
ground  and  highly  credible  network.  However,  it  will  be  impossible  to  fulfill  that

policy  recommendation  without  additional  funding  support  for  the  program.  Re-
search,  education,  and  outreach  are  at  the  heart  of  what  Sea  Grant  is  all  about.
Each  component  must  be  supported  in  order  to  meet  increasing  research  demands
and  to  turn  that  research  into  sound  policy  that  keeps  our  citizens  safe  and  pros-
perous.

Again,  I  urge  you  to  include  in  H.R.  5618  authorization  of  appropriations  levels
that  recognize  the  current  and  future  needs  of  the  program  and  allow  the  program
to grow to $125 million by FY 2014.

What Makes Sea Grant Unique?

Sea Grant was created by Congress in the mid-1960s as an analog to the success-
ful  Land  Grant  College  Program  administered  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agri-
culture. This ‘‘College of the Seas’’ was created to harvest the many talents, diverse
expertise, and ability to respond rapidly to issues and opportunities embodied in the
Nation’s  top  universities,  to  ensure  the  wise  use  and  conservation  of  the  Nation’s
coastal,  marine,  and  Great  Lakes  resources.  I  would  submit  to  you  that  over  the
past  42  years,  Sea  Grant  has  done  just  that,  albeit  with  support  at  more  than  an
order of magnitude less than its sister Land Grant program.

Sea Grant is unique among federal research and outreach programs for a number

of reasons:
Sea Grant is by definition a federal-State-university partnership. Sea Grant provides
planning,  implementation,  and  administrative  mechanisms  by  which  the  Federal
Government can engage the U.S. universities in addressing critical national coastal
and  marine  issues.  Because  it  is  a  matching  fund  program,  the  states  and  univer-
sities  have  a  vested  role  and  responsibility  in  ensuring  that  Sea  Grant  programs
and  activities  are  conducted  in  an  efficient  and  effective  manner.  Indeed,  a  great
number  of  State  Sea  Grant  programs  actually  provide  more  matching  support  than
is required by law (i.e., two federal dollars to one non-federal).
Sea Grant employs an integrated research, education, and extension approach. While
many  federal  science  agencies  focus  their  attention  primarily  on  supporting  re-
search, Sea Grant is unique in that it couples research and outreach together to en-
sure that the scientific information generated is made available to constituencies in
forms that they can understand and use.
Sea  Grant  addresses  ‘‘real’’  problems  and  opportunities  for  ‘‘real’’  people.  The  re-
search  that  Sea  Grant  supports  is  based  on  user  needs,  which  are  solicited  by  the
State Sea Grant programs through planning workshops, on-line surveys, constituent
interactions,  and  information  received  by  agents  and  specialists  with  the  State  Sea
Grant  Extension  Service  programs,  and  is  reflected  in  State  Sea  Grant  strategic
plans. These feedback mechanisms ensure that Sea Grant efforts are relevant, time-
ly,  focused,  and  stakeholder-driven,  and  directly  address  the  needs  of  government,
business, industry, communities, education, and workforce development.
Sea Grant works at many geographic scales. The complexity of issues and opportuni-
ties affecting our nation’s coastal, ocean, and Great Lakes resources underscore the
fact  that  one  cannot  apply  a  ‘‘one  size  fits  all’’  approach  to  them—they  need  to  be
addressed at the appropriate geographic scales. For example, fisheries management
for  the  snapper-grouper  complex  in  the  South  Atlantic  Bight  may  require  a  strong
regional  approach,  whereas  addressing  the  effects  of  land  use  on  ecosystems  may
be better addressed at the local level, where 80 percent of all land-use decisions are
made.  The  point  is  that  Sea  Grant  has  the  built-in  flexibility  to  be  able  to  serve
the  information  needs  of  a  diversity  of  users  at  the  national,  regional,  State,  and
local  levels.  There  are  many  examples  of  such  efforts  in  the  southeastern  U.S.  and
in South Carolina; several are provided in the next section of my testimony.
Sea Grant is seen by its constituencies as an honest broker. Because Sea Grant pro-
grams  focus  on  the  generation  and  delivery  of  science-based  information,  and  have
no resource management or regulatory responsibilities, their staff are able to engage
a  wide  diversity  of  coastal  and  marine  interests  to  develop  consensus  or  resolve  re-
source  conflicts.  Sea  Grant’s  Extension  Program  staff  typically  live  in  the  locations
where  their  clientele  reside;  they  are  members  of  the  communities  in  which  they
work and have built a wealth of credibility with their audiences.
Sea Grant leverages significant resources. Since Sea Grant funding support has fall-
en  far  short  of  the  resources  the  program  needs  to  address  the  ever-increasing  de-
mand  for  its  information,  products,  and  services,  State  Sea  Grant  programs  have
been  able  to  leverage  their  funding  with  other  sources  of  support,  both  human  and
financial.  In  South  Carolina,  for  example,  the  Sea  Grant  Consortium  has  been  able
to competitively secure more than $4 million in grants to complement its Sea Grant

efforts  last  year.  Increased  funding  for  Sea  Grant  will  enable  State  Sea  Grant  pro-
grams to leverage even more. Also, we have been able to develop partnerships with
representatives from State and federal agencies, universities, and the private sector
to  organize  initiatives  to  address  key  resource  issues.  For  example,  the  S.C.  Sea
Grant  Consortium  organized  a  S.C.  Task  Group  on  Harmful  Algae  in  1996,  which
has  collectively  developed  a  multi-institutional  protocols  for  HAB  monitoring  and
surveillance, rapid response to events, and post-event triage.

Resource Challenges in South Carolina and the Region

Sea Grant is thus in a unique position to meet current and future challenges that
confront resource managers, coastal communities, business and industry, and inter-
ested citizen groups throughout the United States through the generation and provi-
sion of science-based information. I have worked with my colleagues at S.C. Depart-
ment  of  Health  and  Environmental  Control–Office  of  Ocean  and  Coastal  Resource
Management  (S.C.  DHEC–OCRM),  S.C.  Department  of  Natural  Resources–Marine
Resources Division (S.C. DNR–MRD) and our counterparts in the southeastern U.S.
to identify a number of these issues.
Coastal  Development.  While  the  southeastern  region  of  the  United  States  is  one
of the least developed in the Nation, it is now the fastest growing. Four of the eight
states  with  the  highest  rate  of  population  growth  from  1960–1990  were  the  four
southeastern  states.  According  to  the  Census  Bureau,  the  four  southeastern  U.S.
states  have  been  recently  ranked  as  the  top  thirteen  fastest  growing  states  in  the
Nation,  and  one-third  of  the  Nation’s  100  fastest-growing  counties  are  in  Georgia
(16),  Florida  (14),  North  Carolina  (3),  and  South  Carolina  (1).  This  growth  is  con-
centrated in coastal counties, and is out-pacing our ability to understand, react, and
plan  for  changes  in  environmental,  social,  and  economic  conditions.  Significant  im-
pacts to the landscape, estuarine water quality, and coastal ecosystem integrity are
predicted  as  a  result  of  increasing  coastal  urbanization  due  to  population  growth.
Growth  and  development  are  already  placing  enormous  pressure  on  coastal  re-
sources,  watersheds,  and  the  adjacent  coastal  ocean.  Sea  Grant  is  well-positioned,
with  an  expansion  of  its  coastal  community  development  initiative,  to  enhance  its
role in addressing the issues that have emerged from these development pressures.
Mapping  Marine  Resources.  Proper  management  and  use  of  the  region’s  living
and  non-living  marine  resources  requires  that  that  region  undertake  a  comprehen-
sive mapping and research program. Presently, less than five percent (five percent)
of the coastal ocean region of the southeastern U.S. has been mapped. A comprehen-
sive assessment of (1) existing ocean infrastructure (e.g., pipelines, cables, channels,
etc.),  (2)  sources  and  quality  of  sand  resources  for  beach  nourishment  projects,  (3)
critical  fisheries  habitat,  including  documentation  of  hard  bottom  areas  and  other
important habitats, and (4) potential offshore energy sources, including natural gas,
is  necessary  to  identify  the  potential  for  multiple  use  conflicts  and  allow  for  com-
prehensive planning for an expanding range of ocean activities. Therefore, a signifi-
cant  need  exists  for  standardized,  integrated,  and  accessible  spatial  data  for  the
management  of  marine  resources  in  our  region.  Management  of  the  region’s  ocean
and coastal resources is dependent on developing the scientific understanding of the
processes  that  control  resource  behavior,  and  their  fate  is  essential  to  maintaining
healthy  ecosystems  and  providing  renewable,  enjoyable,  and  safe  resources  to  the
public.  Sea  Grant  has  the  capacity  in  its  universities  to  generate  and  disseminate
such information to the resource management community.
Healthy  Fisheries  and  Habitat.  The  South  Atlantic  Fishery  Management  Coun-
cil, through a partnership of State agencies, federal agencies, universities, and con-
servation organizations, is developing a Fishery Ecosystem Plan and Comprehensive
Ecosystem  Amendment  for  the  South  Atlantic  region.  This  effort  will  meet  existing
and  anticipated  mandates  in  the  Magnuson-Steven  Fishery  Conservation  and  Man-
agement  Act,  the  Ecosystem  Principals  Report  to  Congress,  and  the  President’s
Ocean  Action  Plan  developed  in  response  to  the  U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy.
Goals  include  maintaining  and  improving  (1)  ecosystem  structure  and  function,  (2)
economic,  social,  and  cultural  benefits  from  resources,  and  (3)  biological,  economic,
and  cultural  diversity  in  the  South  Atlantic  Region.  Ecosystem-based  management
has  been  embraced  by  the  Regional  Council,  but  will  require  a  significant  invest-
ment in research and outreach to implement it. Again, this is an effort to which Sea
Grant can greatly contribute.
Watershed-Coastal Ocean Linkages. From the interior basins to the coastal mar-
gins,  natural  processes  and  human  activities  in  the  southeastern  U.S.  are  affected
by  water  flow,  and  its  role  in  determining  the  transport  and  fate  of  materials  and
the  structure  of  ecosystems.  Inputs  of  freshwater  from  rivers,  ground  water,  and

34

rainfall  vary  spatially  and  temporally.  Associated  with  the  volumes  of  water  deliv-
ered  to  the  coastal  ocean  are  variable  loads  of  sediment,  nutrients,  and  pollutants.
The inputs of freshwater and materials interact with the coastal ocean to influence
processes  such  as  local  circulation  patterns,  sediment  accumulation  and  transport,
shoreline dynamics, and habitat quality and stability for marine and estuarine spe-
cies.
Disaster-Resilient  Communities.  Hurricanes  and  other  coastal  hazards  are  a
major  concern  in  the  southeastern  U.S.,  threatening  hundreds  of  coastal  commu-
nities,  a  multi-billion  dollar  tourism  industry,  coastal  and  watershed  development
and  infrastructure,  the  fishing  industry,  and  traditional  coastal  enterprises.  In  the
wake  of  Hurricane  Hugo,  which  struck  the  South  Carolina  coast  in  1989,  over  $5
billion  in  damages  to  coastal  residences  and  industry  underscored  the  vulnerability
of  coastal  development  to  natural  processes.  The  more  significant  impacts,  both
human  and  structural,  that  occurred  as  a  result  of  Hurricanes  Andrew,  Katrina,
Rita, and Wilma have since underscored the need for the southeast region to greatly
enhance  its  understanding  of  ocean  and  weather  dynamics  and  improve  its  pre-
diction  and  forecasting  capabilities.  Longer-term  phenomena,  such  as  climate
change  and  sea  level  rise,  have  also  emerged  as  critical  issues  for  coastal  resource
managers and coastal communities. Each of the southeastern states has initiated ac-
tivities  that  focus  on  the  needs  of  the  states  in  light  of  emerging  concerns  about
these long-term coastal hazards.
Prospects  for  Near-shore  and  Offshore  Energy  Development.  In  2006,  the
U.S. Congress passed an energy bill to increase the ability of the Nation to become
more  energy  self-sufficient.  Strategies  include  opening  additional  coastal  ocean  and
offshore  areas  to  further  oil  and  gas  development,  as  well  as  pursuing  alternative
energy solutions through wind, wave, current, biofuels, and others. For example, off
the southeastern U.S. coast, there is industry interest in natural gas deposits, com-
panies are exploring the feasibility of siting offshore wind energy facilities, and the
potential for wave and current energy is now being discussed.
Environmental  Education  and  Public  Awareness.  Population  trends  for  the
southeast  U.S.  region,  and  the  limited  information  that  exists  on  its  coastal  ocean
resources,  suggests  that  there  are  many  more  people  living  in  the  southeastern
United  States  that  have  little  knowledge  of  or  experience  with  the  dynamic  nature
of  our  region’s  ecosystems,  hurricane  and  storm  patterns,  shoreline  and  beaches,
and other coastal ocean-related phenomena. A regional partnership is needed to fos-
ter a ‘‘sense of place’’ among southeastern coastal residents, and to clarify links be-
tween  the  health  of  the  coastal  and  ocean  ecosystem  and  their  quality  of  life;  an
effort  that  Sea  Grant  can  foster.  An  informed  population  is  a  prepared  population.

Selected Sea Grant Highlights in South Carolina and the Region

There is great potential and inertia with the Sea Grant College program network
to  play  a  much  more  significant  role  in  addressing  critical  coastal,  marine,  and
Great  Lakes  issues  and  opportunities  throughout  the  Nation  with  an  increase  in
program  support.  Nevertheless,  Sea  Grant  continues  to  produce  significant  results
for  its  extremely  diverse  and  varied  constituencies  at  the  regional,  State,  and  local
levels on behalf of the Federal and State governments and the over 300 universities
it engages.

The Sea Grant program has significantly contributed towards a sustainable envi-
ronment and economy through integrated programs of research, education, and out-
reach  in  my  own  State  of  South  Carolina,  as  the  following  regional  and  State-level
examples illustrate.

Regional Sea Grant Highlights

Establishing  the  Southeast  Regional  Association  for  Ocean  Observing.
The  S.C.  Sea  Grant  Consortium  is  serving  as  the  lead  organization,  under  the
terms  of  a  grant  awarded  by  the  NOAA  Coastal  Services  Center,  to  foster  the
establishment of a ‘‘Regional Association’’ for the coastal ocean observing system
network  in  the  Southeastern  coastal  ocean  region  of  the  United  States  to  inte-
grate  coastal  ocean  observing  capabilities  and  provide  regional  data  and  infor-
mation.  The  Southeast  Coastal  Ocean  Observations  Regional  Association,
(SECOORA: see http://secoora.org), with Consortium leadership and assistance,
is  providing  administrative,  operational,  and  budgetary  support  for  SECOORA,
which has been incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation with 42 dues-
paying member organizations from NC, SC, GA, and FL.

Improving Flood Detection and Warning Capabilities. Riverine and coast-
al  flooding  associated  with  hurricanes,  tropical  storms,  and  other  forces  of  na-
ture cause significant loss of property and economic hardship each year. To help
communities in South Carolina, North Carolina and beyond, the S.C. Sea Grant
Consortium and its partners, the National Sea Grant Office, North Carolina Sea
Grant,  and  the  NOAA  National  Severe  Storms  Laboratory  (NSSL),  are  leading
a  regional  project,  CI–FLOW  (Coastal/Inland  Flood  Observation  and  Warning),
to  pilot  a  new  flood  detection  and  monitoring  system.  Test  results  are  being
used in conjunction with NOAA National Weather Service flood tools to improve
flash  flood  detection  and  warning  capabilities.  CI–FLOW  is  also  being  inte-
grated by N.C. State University researchers into a hurricane storm surge model
to  provide  more  accurate  inputs  from  riverine  flooding,  as  well  as  being  trans-
ferred to Sea Grant programs in the Gulf of Mexico for flood applications there.
Multi-disciplinary  Team’s  Findings  Published  in  Book  by  Springer-
Verlag.  Understanding  how  coastal  growth  and  development  impacts  natural
resources  helps  decision-makers  guide  development  for  both  economic  benefit
and conservation of our natural resource heritage. Results of the South Atlantic
Bight  Land  Use—Coastal  Ecosystem  Study  (LU–CES),  a  multi-disciplinary  re-
search  program  initiated  by  the  S.C.  Sea  Grant  Consortium  with  funding  from
the  NOAA  Coastal  Ocean  Program,  have  formed  the  basis  for  a  recently  pub-
lished book by Springer-Verlag titled Changing Land-Use Patterns in the Coast-
al  Zone:  Managing  Environmental  Quality  in  Rapidly  Growing  Regions,  edited
by Gary S. Kleppel, M. Richard DeVoe, and Mac V. Rawson. South Carolina and
Georgia Sea Grant extension and communications staff wrote the chapter intro-
ductions,  which  provide  the  reader  with  a  summary  of  each  chapter  written  in
layman’s terms. The book is part of the Springer Series on Environmental Man-
agement,  and  up  to  two  dozen  investigators  from  a  range  of  marine-related
science disciplines contributed to the text by writing chapters. Due to its multi-
disciplinary  and  collaborative  nature,  the  book  should  become  a  landmark  in
the area of understanding coastal estuarine ecosystem dynamics and the nature
of  anthropogenic  inputs.  To  date,  almost  1,000  copies  of  the  book  have  been
sold.
SouthEast  Center  for  Ocean  Sciences  Education  Excellence.  The  South-
East  Center  for  Ocean  Sciences  Education  Excellence  (COSEE–SE),  one  of  10
regional centers supported by the National Science Foundation nation-wide, has
been  established  at  the  S.C.  Sea  Grant  Consortium  through  a  multi-year  grant
from the NSF, with additional funding from NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration
and the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The role of COSEE–SE is to foster edu-
cator-scientist interactions, increase access and preparation of culturally diverse
populations,  promote  regional  networking  and  collaboration,  and  improve
science  education  and  ocean  literacy  for  all  citizens.  To  date,  COSEE–SE  has
partnered with more than 75 organizations to engage more than 2,500 teachers
from  NC,  SC,  and  GA  in  enhancing  their  capabilities  in  incorporating  ocean
sciences in the classroom.

South Carolina Sea Grant Highlights

Bringing  Marine  Science  to  the  Upstate.  Recognizing  that  the  influence  of
the  oceans  extends  well  inland  from  the  coast,  and  that  activities  in  upland
areas can have impacts on coastal, the Roper Mountain Science Center (RMSC)
in  Greenville,  SC  secured  a  small  grant  of  just  $1,500  from  the  Consortium  in
the  mid-1980s  to  assemble  a  ‘‘touch-tank’’  so  that  children  in  the  upstate  could
become more familiar with sea life. According to the center, this modest invest-
ment  by  Sea  Grant  led  to  the  development  of  the  Marine  Lab  and  the  Ecology
Lab  at  the  Center.  The  Center  is  now  in  the  process  of  developing  education
exhibits  in  the  labs,  and  in  the  coming  year  8,000  students  and  teachers  will
attend  formal  lessons  in  the  Marine  Lab.  Each  lesson  will  focus  on  the  South
Carolina Science Curriculum Standards. Students from 29 school districts in 14
counties  visit  the  Roper  Center,  and  11,000  other  children  will  see  the  Marine
Lab at designated public times. The Consortium continues to support the Roper
Mountain  Science  Center  and  assist  with  new  exhibits  to  enhance  teaching
skills  and  experiences.  Last  year,  the  Consortium  supported  a  grant  for  edu-
cation  presentation  equipment  needed  for  lessons  in  the  new  Marine  Lab.  I
have attached to this testimony a letter from Dr. Brandis Hartsell, Curator, Ma-
rine and Earth Sciences at RMSC, which provides more detail about this excit-
ing partnership.

Securing  Residential  Structures  in  the  Face  of  Coastal  Hazards.  With
Sea  Grant  support,  Dr.  Ed  Sutt,  while  a  graduate  student  at  Clemson  Univer-
sity,  studied  better  ways  to  secure  residential  home  structures  under  threat
from hurricanes and earthquakes. He discovered that house failures often start
with  a  broken  window.  High  winds  then  inflate  the  house  and  cause  the  roof
to  lift  from  its  frame.  In  response,  and  based  on  initial  Sea  Grant  support,  Dr.
Sutt, now with Stanley Works, invented a nail made of carbon-steel alloy, with
a  wider  head  than  other  nails,  barbs  that  hold  the  shaft  firmly  in  the  frame
to  prevent  pullout,  and  a  twist  below  the  nail  head  to  fill  the  space  that  the
barbs open to hold the nail in place. Tests, during which the new nail was sub-
jected  to  hurricane  force  winds,  revealed  the  nail  held  at  20,000  pounds:  at
9,000 pounds, regular nails begin to pull out of the framework. Dr. Sutt’s inven-
tion,  known  as  the  Hurri-Quake  nail,  was  voted  the  2006  Grand  Award  Win-
ner for the ‘‘Innovation of the Year’’ by the national magazine, Popular Science.
Enhancing  Red  Drum  Stocks.  Sea  Grant-supported  stock  enhancement  re-
search  on  the  state’s  top  gamefish,  red  drum,  has  demonstrated  that  red  drum
can  be  spawned  in  captivity,  released  into  coastal  estuaries,  and  make  signifi-
cant  contributions  to  natural  coastal  populations.  This  research  is  being  con-
ducted in South Carolina by S.C. Department of Natural Resources–Marine Re-
sources Division scientists. As a result of Sea Grant support, stock enhancement
is  now  a  recognized  management  tool  for  red  drum  in  South  Carolina.  In  addi-
tion,  methodologies  developed  during  the  research—utilizing  state-of-the-art
chemical  and  genetic  marking  techniques—are  now  being  implemented  as  the
primary  marking  and  detection  technique  by  S.C.  DNR  for  all  fish  stocked  in
South Carolina waters.
Conservation  Plan  Helps  Jasper  County  Prepare  for  Growth.  Jasper
County,  like  many  South  Carolina  communities,  is  growing  at  a  rapid  pace.
Planning  and  managing  that  growth  is  important  to  support  and  conserve  the
natural  resources  that  enhance  economic  development.  In  August  of  2004,  the
S.C. Sea Grant Consortium, in conjunction with the Jasper Soil and Water Con-
servation District (JSWCD), the USDA–Natural Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS),  and  the  S.C.  Department  of  Natural  Resources,  began  a  countywide
conservation planning effort. In November 2006, the plan was submitted to the
County  for  incorporation  into  the  Natural  Resource  Element  of  their  Com-
prehensive  Land  Use  Plan.  A  print  version  was  published  in  June  2007  and  is
also available on CD–ROM and on the S.C. Sea Grant Consortium web site.

Summary—Enhanced Federal Support for Sea Grant is Critical

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I  join  with  my  Sea  Grant  col-
leagues around the country to suggest that the National Sea Grant College Program
should become NOAA’s primary university-based research, education, exten-
sion  and  outreach,  and  technical  assistance  program  for  coastal,  marine,
and  Great  Lakes  resources.  However,  to  achieve  this  end  will  require  a  signifi-
cant infusion of federal (and thus non-federal matching) support to enhance the Na-
tional Sea Grant College Program to a level of $125 million by fiscal year 2014.

I  believe  it  is  critical  for  the  Congress  to  provide  the  National  Sea  Grant  College
Program  with  the  resources  necessary  to  build  on  the  program’s  record  of  success
and  promise  with  a  reauthorization  of  appropriations  that  matches  both  the  imme-
diate  and  long-term  needs  of  all  who  live  and  work  along  the  Nation’s  coastlines,
and  one  that  represents  the  initial  step  in  achieving  a  broader  vision  for  the  pro-
gram as proposed in this testimony.

Thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  on  behalf  of  the  S.C.  Sea  Grant
Consortium.  I  will  be  glad  to  address  any  questions  the  Subcommittee  may  have.

STATEMENT OF MR. PATRICK F. RILEY, GENERAL MANAGER,

WESTERN SEAFOOD COMPANY, INC., FREEPORT, TEXAS

Mr.  RILEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  Members  of
the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here today to address
this  body  in  reference  to  H.R.  5618,  National  Sea  Grant  College
Program.

First, let me say that my testimony here today is reflective of the
experiences that I have encountered while engaged in the Gulf and
South Atlantic shrimp fisheries. I would be remiss if I did not point
out  this  interaction  only  offers  a  small  sampling  of  the  activities
the Sea Grant College program is involved in across this great na-
tion as a whole.

My  first  encounter  with  Sea  Grant  came  in  an  educational  set-
ting. When I was in elementary school, I was in the fifth grade and
was attending a career fair that the school was hosting to get youth
to think about their future. This is where I first met Charlie Moss
with Texas Sea Grant. He was a Brazoria County Extension agent
and had a booth highlighting commercial fishing. This was of great
interest  to  me  since  my  father  was  an  owner-operator  of  a  Gulf
shrimp trawler for decades. While I must have been a certain pest
to  Mr.  Moss,  he  diligently  answered  the  myriad  of  questions  that
I and others threw at him. This type of educational work continues
today  and  was  highlighted  with  a  field  trip  on  May  8  of  this  year
of  the  kindergarten  students  from  O.M.  Roberts  that  participated
in  an  annual  field  trip  to  the  beach.  I  was  there  and  participated
as  a  volunteer  father  helping  pull  the  biological  sampling  seine  to
collect specimens for the students to look at. For the vast majority
of these students, this is the first and perhaps the only interaction
they  will  have  with  aquatic  life  in  living  form  that  is  literally  at
their  doorsteps  on  the  beaches  of  coastal  Texas.  The  field  trip  has
become a much-anticipated rite of passage for the students of OMR
and  its  success  is  in  great  part  due  to  the  participation  of  Sea
Grant  and  the  current  Brazoria  County  Extension  agent,  Mr.  Rich
Tillman.

In much the same vein, the research vessel Karma, better known
as the Floating Classroom, has helped tens of thousands of Texans,
most of whom are students from the fourth through the 12th grade,
who  come  to  gain  a  higher  appreciation  of  the  vast  ecological  sig-
nificance  of  our  coastal  estuaries  and  near-shore  waters  since  its
arrival in 2002.

My  professional  interaction  with  Sea  Grant  has  been  both  im-
mense  and  rewarding.  At  Western  Seafood,  we  have  been  actively
involved with different Sea Grant-led or -sponsored initiatives since
the  mid-1970s.  Almost  all  of  these  initiatives  and  projects  involve
two  common  themes.  The  first  of  these  becoming  more  efficient
with our time, our production and resources we are harvesting. The
second theme is helping us use our innate knowledge as fisherman
to become better stewards of our marine environment.

In its early years, Sea Grant worked with fisherman such as my
father to develop a very successful hang log trawl obstruction book.
Through  cooperative  effort  with  the  shrimp  industry,  over  12,000
hangs  were  identified  from  the  Rio  Grande  River  to  the  mouth  of
the  Mississippi.  It  should  be  stressed  that  this  information  was
usually  kept  confidential  among  fisherman  but  the  cooperative
spirit of Sea Grant convinced captains to share their personal infor-
mation  so  that  every  producer  would  have  access  to  the  collective
industry wisdom. This hang book has become a bible aboard trawl-
ers until the introduction of more sophisticated navigation systems.
It  is  credited  with  significantly  reducing  gear  loss  or  damage  from
bottom  obstructions  and  has  literally  saved  the  industry  hundreds
of millions of dollars.

One  of  the  first  major  breakthroughs  that  dealt  with  production
efficiency was introduced at the quad rig trawl. Prior to that time,
shrimp trawlers typically pulled one net on each side of the vessel.
With  the  advent  of  the  quad  rig,  it  allowed  operators  to  pull  four
smaller  nets,  reducing  drag  and  fuel  consumption  while  increasing
the  amount  of  area  covered  due  to  overall  increase  of  head  rope
sweep  of  the  nets  involved.  Production  could  be  increased  while
costs  of  inputs  actually  went  down.  This  work  was  pioneered  by
Sea Grant fishery specialist Gary Graham working closely with in-
dustry.

In  the  mid  to  late  1980s,  another  hurdle  was  jumped  with  the
help  of  Sea  Grant.  Implementation  of  turtle  excluder  devices,  or
TEDs, was a very controversial issue. The vast majority of industry
participants  did  not  want  anything  to  do  with  these  devices  and
the  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service,  or  NMFS,  was  having  a
very  difficult  time  implementing  their  use.  At  this  time  Sea  Grant
stepped  in  to  diffuse  a  very  volatile  situation.  Using  the  goodwill
built up over the last two decades of successful interaction with in-
dustry,  fishery  specialists  worked  to  calm  fears  of  the  fisherman
and  worked  with  a  few  ‘‘high  liners’’  to  show  the  gear  would  not
be  as  adverse  to  the  operation  as  it  once  feared.  Once  these  trials
showed success, the fleet started to adopt these devices, and within
a very short period of time came into compliance with NMFS regu-
lations.

When  bycatch  became  a  major  issue  in  the  mid-1990s  in  the  in-
dustry,  Sea  Grant  was  there  to  help  the  industry  not  only  become
compliant with new federal mandates but also encouraged develop-

ment  of  industry-based  solutions  to  the  problem.  As  a  result,  the
most  efficient  device  that  is  legal  today,  Jones-Davis,  was  devel-
oped by two fishermen. At the same time, Sea Grant specialists in
the  Gulf  of  Mexico  spearheaded  a  massive  effort  that  resulted  in
the  shrimp  fishery  have  what  some  have  called  the  greatest  data
set of catch characterization of any fishery in the United States.

Sea Grant remains in the forefront regarding efforts to make our
fishery  more  economically  sustainable  and  efficient.  During  1990,
the  Texas  Sea  Grant  Program  pioneered  with  Allied  Chemical
Company  to  evaluate  the  use  of  technologically  advanced  trawl  fi-
bers. As a result, over 500 trawlers converted to the use of Spectra
netting, which significantly increased trawl strength while creating
less drag in the water. This transferred to better fuel efficiency and
its  application  is  now  being  used  worldwide.  Today  Sea  Grant  is
demonstrating  less  expensive  high-technological  fiber,  Sapphire,
which  has  been  rapidly  adopted  by  shrimp  vessels  for  its  strength
and contributions to energy efficiency.

During  a  2001  trip  to  Iceland  to  visit  vendors  of  processing
equipment  that  we  utilize  in  our  shore-side  operations,  I  became
introduced to the hydrodynamic trawl door. I was intrigued by the
concept, and in 2004 started to seek out partnering manufacturers
around  the  world  so  we  could  introduce  these  new  trawl  doors  in
the  Gulf  shrimp  fishery.  When  I  found  no  interest  in  doing  so,  I
purchased an off-the-shelf model from an Icelandic company. When
I  was  planning  the  sea  trial,  I  contacted  fishery  specialist  Gary
Graham  to  see  if  he  was  interested  in  going  along.  He  did,  and
what  he  witnessed  was  pure  failure,  but  he  was  supportive  and
urged  me  to  continue.  Two  months  later,  we  regrouped  with  an-
other  size  door  and  went  on  a  second  sea  trial.  Gary  accompanied
us then and we came back successful in most regards. We still had
a  production  equivalency  program  to  deal  with  but  overcame  this
in  short  order.  After  numerous  trials  and  modifications  to  these
new  doors,  we  were  able  to  show  catch  rates  that  were  equal  to
that  of  traditional  gear  but  with  a  fuel  savings  of  30  percent.  At
this  time,  Sea  Grant  stepped  in  with  technology  transfer  in  mind.
Gary Graham and Sea Grant economist Mike Haby were able to
secure  funding  from  USDA  and  the  Texas  governor’s  energy  office
to  fund  two  pilot  demonstration  programs.  These  projects  funded
the  purchase  of  new  high-efficiency  trawl  doors,  high-strength  net-
ting for cooperative research and demonstrations within the shrimp
industry  for  a  scientifically  based  and  statistically  reviewed  study
to  document  the  potential  fuel  savings  the  gear  would  produce.
This  effort  alone  introduced  the  gear  to  fisheries  as  a  whole  and
lended  it  credibility.  It  is  through  this  effort  this  gear  is  being
adopted rapidly by industry. Today in the ports of Brownsville and
Port Isabel in south Texas, 50 percent of the 180 to 190 active ves-
sels in the fishery will have converted to this gear prior to opening
of  our  Texas  shrimp  season  on  July  15.  One  could  extrapolate  this
savings could approach two million gallons of fuel in just these two
ports  based  on  historical  consumption  averages  of  the  fleet.  At  $4
a gallon, this will have a significant impact on the continued viabil-
ity of fishing in south Texas.

In  conclusion,  I  would  like  to  stress  Sea  Grant  is  a  unique  pro-
gram  that  has  provided  a  vital  research  and  outreach  link  for  the

fishery.  The  savings  to  the  fishery  in  the  Texas  program  has  con-
sistently  contributed  through  its  research  and  educational  efforts
that  far  exceeded  the  costs  for  funding  this  worthwhile  organiza-
tion. I would ask that you continue to endorse Sea Grant and that
serious support be directed towards its continued existence. Thank
you for your time and consideration regarding my testimony.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PATRICK F. RILEY

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here
today  to  address  this  body  in  reference  to  H.R.  5618,  National  Sea  Grant  College
Program Act.

First, let me say that my testimony here today is reflective of the experiences that
I  have  encountered  while  engaged  in  the  Gulf  and  South  Atlantic  Shrimp  fisheries

While I must have been a certain pest to Mr. Moss, he diligently answered the myr-
iad of questions that I and others threw at him. This type of educational work con-
tinues  today  and  was  highlighted  with  a  field  trip  on  May  8th  of  this  year  when
kindergarten students from O.M. Roberts participated in an annual Field trip to the
beach.  I  was  there  and  participated  as  a  volunteer  father  helping  pull  a  biological
sampling seine to collect specimens for the students to look at. For the vast majority
of  these  students,  this  is  the  first  and  perhaps  the  only  interaction  that  they  will
have  with  aquatic  life  in  a  living  form  that  is  literally  at  their  doorstep  on  the
beaches of coastal Texas. This field trip has become a much anticipated right of pas-
sage for the students of O.M.R. and it’s success is in great part due to the participa-

ity of fishing in south Texas.

In conclusion, I would like to stress that Sea Grant is a unique program that has
provided a vital research and outreach link for the fishery. The savings to the fish-
ery  that  the  Texas  program  has  consistently  contributed  through  its  research  and
educational efforts have far exceeded the costs for funding this worthwhile organiza-

DISCUSSION

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
At  this  time  we  will  go  into  our  first  round  of  questioning,  and
the  Chair  will  recognize  himself  for  five  minutes  for  that  first  set
of questions.

EXPANDING H.R. 5618’S MANDATE

I have a question for the whole panel, if some of you would com-
ment, anyone who cares to. H.R. 5618 expands the Sea Grant pro-
gram’s mandate beyond its State and local focus to include regional
and national issues. What is the benefit of expanding the mandate

and  how  will  the  Sea  Grant  programs  maintain  their  connections
to  the  current  State  and  local  constituents,  and  aren’t  you  already
undertaking some regionally and nationally research and extension
projects now? Go ahead, Mr. McLean, if you would like.

Mr. MCLEAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think that as the U.S.
Commission  on  Ocean  Policy  recognized  in  terms  of  listening  to  a
great  number  of  citizens,  a  great  number  of  constituents  and  en-
capsulating  the  challenges  that  are  ahead  of  us  in  the  marine  and
coastal  environment,  the  regional  approach  to  the  solutions  that
arise  within  localized  communities,  coastal  communities,  these
challenges  and  tasks  are  best  approached  regionally.  The  chal-
lenges  don’t  know  geopolitical  lines,  they  don’t  know  State  borders
and the like, and for us to be approaching them regionally is a very
logical  approach.  The  work  that  we  have  ongoing  today  in  more
broad-based  application  of  science  is  not  quite  bringing  home  the
value  of  the  Sea  Grant  program.  I  think  by  relying  on  Sea  Grant
to be the leader in a regional solution to the scientific and technical
challenges  that  we  have  today,  we  have  a  well-practiced  method-
ology that you have heard from the witnesses in terms of its effec-
tiveness and its efficiency.

I  would  also  like  to  highlight  the  leadership  that  the  Sea  Grant
program and each of the member institutions is showing by helping
to  lead  a  regional  interpretation  and  a  regional  prioritization  of
what  is  now  a  national  ocean  research  priority  plan  that  was  fi-
nally  developed  after  many  years  of  the  ocean  and  coastal  commu-
nity  wanting  many  different  things.  We  now  have  a  priority  that
we  can  come  to  you  with,  and  identify  what  is  the  most  important
and  we  can  concentrate  our  efforts  in  that  regard.  Sea  Grant  is
leading  the  development  of  regional  prioritization  of  these  chal-
lenges  so  that  we  as  a  nation  can  have  an  agreed-upon  path  for-
ward.  I  think  the  institution  is  very  important  to  the  success  of
that effort.

Chairman LAMPSON. Okay.
Mr.  ANDERSON.  Just  on  your  second  point,  Mr.  Chairman,  yes,
the  regional  planning  approach  that  the  Sea  Grant  College  Pro-
gram  has  undertaken  over  the  last  couple  of  years  is  yielding  re-
gionally specific prioritization of issues and research approaches to
the  national  Ocean  Research  Plan  and  by  doing  so,  we  are  able  to
bring  each  of  the  states  in  a  region,  for  instance,  my  region,  the
Northeast, several states are involved and the Sea Grant programs
bring  to  that  discussion  the  varying  complexions  of  those  issues
from  each  of  the  state’s  perspectives,  but  as  soon  as  we  get  into
that  room  and  around  that  table  and  talk  about  these,  we  realize
that there is more commonality with the challenges than there are
differences and by me speaking for the University of Maine, for ex-
ample, and sitting down with the director from MIT, you know, we
are able to bring skill sets from all these different research institu-
tions and universities from around our region to contemplate more
innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to what these problems
are,  and  as  was  just  stated,  those  problem  transcend  geographic
boundaries.  So  the  regional  approach  really  has  been  somewhat
common  in  the  Sea  Grant  enterprise,  and  now  by  formalizing  this
and  making  some  explicit  steps  in  that  direction,  I  think  we  can
really get some work done.

Chairman LAMPSON. Okay. Mr. DeVoe.
Mr.  DEVOE.  Just  a  quick  comment.  The  need  to  look  at  issues
and opportunities and resources on a regional basis is profound, as
the  Ocean  Commission  has  pointed  out.  However,  the  reason  Sea
Grant  will  maintain  its  legs  on  the  ground  in  the  State  and  local
levels  is  because  a  lot  of  decision-making  occurs  at  that  level.
Eighty  percent  of  all  land  use  decisions  are  made  at  a  municipal
or local level. So we have to understand these issues from a broad-
er  perspective  and  the  research  needs  to  focus  on  climate  change
or  sea  level  rise  in  a  broader  perspective.  But  there  are  nuances
at  a  State  and  local  level  that  need  to  be  dealt  with.  The  manage-
ment  structures  and  the  policy  structures  are  really  at  the  State
level.  We  don’t  manage  regionally,  we  manage  state  by  state.  So
what we are trying to do is add to the mix of tools and information
to allow this decision-making to occur at a variety of scales.

TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Mr.  Riley,  I  want  to  get  you  to  talk  a  little
differently  than  that,  if  I  may.  Give  me  your  perspective  on  Sea
Grant from, I guess, for the role that it plays in providing technical
assistance and information to your industry. I know you gave a lit-
tle  bit  of  comments  on  that  during  your  prepared  remarks.  What
specific  examples  can  you  provide  regarding  tangible  benefits  that
your community has received over the years from the Sea Grant ac-
tivities?

Mr. RILEY. Well, of late it has been technology transfer, but there
are  too  numerous  to  really  mention  in  this  forum.  I  would  like  to
get  back  to  you  in  writing  on  that.  But  take,  for  instance,  as  you
all  well  know,  the  business  I  am  in,  the  shrimp  business  is  pretty
tough  these  days,  and  going  back  into  2003,  when  Sea  Grant  be-
came  aware  of  USDA  money  being  available  to  commercial  fisher-
man  through  the  Trade  Adjustment  Assistance  Program,  there
were some qualifications to that, being that to receive that funding,
these fisherman had to be trained, and Texas Sea Grant along with
that  of  all  the  others  along  the  Gulf  Coast  and  up  the  East  Coast
involved  with  shrimp  fishery,  Texas  in  particular  set  out  a  pro-
gram,  held  28  workshops  from  Port  Arthur  to  Brownsville,  trained
2,300 or so—this is by memory—2,300 or so eligible fishermen and
were  able  to  get  them  over  11,  or  close  to  $11  million  in  direct  as-
sistance,  and  that  is  pretty  significant.  And  these  are  individual
fishermen, not boat owners and things like that, because there was
income qualifications to that. A lot of ownership did not qualify for
this,  you  know,  assistance,  so  this  was  directly  to  crews  and  cap-
tains  and  things  of  that  nature.  And  without  that  training  and
without  even,  you  know,  getting  the  knowledge  out  or  getting  the
word out, you know, a lot of this would have gone unrealized.

And  then  you  have  today  in  our  effort  throughout  the  industry
to  become  more  efficient,  and  what  we  have  kind  of  started  in-
house  at  Western  has  really  ballooned  into  something,  you  know,
pretty  big  with  the  numbers  I  have  given  you  on  fuel  cost  reduc-
tion.  Sea  Grant  is  working  together  on  a  regional  basis  and  you
have got guys from Texas going to North Carolina, which I accom-
panied  them  on  that  trip  for  a  week  of  workshops  for  fishermen
there, and the same thing is happening in Mississippi and there is,

46

you  know,  all  kind  of  feelers  coming  out  from  Louisiana  and  other
Gulf  states  to  get  that  kind  of  program  running.  So  I  mean,  they
do  work  well  together  in  the  extension  end  of  it,  and  far  as  tech-
nology transfer, it is a good thing.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
I will now recognize Mr. Inglis for five minutes.

AQUACULTURE
Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  am  interested  in  a  number  of  things  that  I  have  heard  in  the
testimony  and  seen  in  our  charter.  One  is  aquaculture,  which  I
guess  is  something  that  we  have  begun  in  Sea  Grant,  right?  I
guess,  Mr.  DeVoe,  we  are  pursuing  that  in  South  Carolina  in  var-
ious places.

Mr. DEVOE. We are, yes, sir. And Sea Grant has supported a lot
of research in aquaculture in the Southeast and in South Carolina.
We still have a viable but small marine shrimp aquaculture indus-
try.  Back  in  the  1980s,  crawfish  farming  came  to  South  Carolina
and actually it was some interaction between our Sea Grant exten-
sion specialist in aquaculture, Jack Whetstone, who met up with a
fellow  who  has  passed  away  since,  but  Larry  Delabratante  from
Louisiana,  and  brought  the  ability  to  culture—brought  the  tech-
nology  to  culture,  to  grow  crawfish  in  ponds  to  South  Carolina.  In
South  Carolina,  though,  the  primary  type  of  aquaculture  that  goes
on  is  shellfish  aquaculture  so  we  have  strong  clam  aquaculture,
and there is work looking at trying to develop a single oyster aqua-
culture  industry.  As  you  know,  our  oysters  are  clusters  naturally,
but for single oyster aquaculture, which gets a premium price, that
is being pursued. So there are a lot of opportunities there.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  some  of  those  opportunities  may  involve  things
that  Mr.  McLean  mentioned,  the  pretty  nifty  idea  of  submerging
the barge and growing things there, especially with the pond-grown
shrimp,  Mr.  Riley  might  hop  in  here  because  my  brother  also  has
a  shrimp  boat  and  he  tells  us,  you  know,  you  got  to  watch  what
you  are  eating  when  you  are  eating  shrimp  because  the  shrimp
that you are eating may be absolutely chock full of antibiotics from
wherever  it  has  come  from  if  it  is  grown  in  a  pond.  And  so  I  sup-
pose  I  am  a  little  bit  concerned  about  that,  you  know,  and  I  won-
der, do we do research on that at Sea Grant or does Sea Grant look
at  more  the  ocean-based  shrimping  rather  than,  say,  pond-raised
shrimp?

Mr.  DEVOE.  I  will  say  that  Sea  Grant’s  investment  in  aqua-
culture  in  the  last  decade  has  focused  on  sustainable  shrimp  cul-
ture  and  sustainable  aquaculture  in  general.  The  issues  with  re-
spect  to,  you  know,  what  is  in  the  shrimp  that  we  eat  that  is  cul-
tured  I  think  really  plays  out  in  the  international  scene  and  the
importation  of  shrimp  from  overseas,  which  most  consumers  are
buying  because  they  are  so  cheap  and  it  has  affected  the  ability  of
the  United  States  culture  industry,  and  I  am  not—I  mean,  I  am
just saying. But it certainly has affected the viability, the economic
viability  of  our  domestic  shrimp  industry  as  well.  So  I  think  the
focus has been in the last decade or so is trying to—they call it bio-
security  to  try  to  maintain  a  crop,  if  I  could  use  that  term,  for  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:59 Sep 29, 2008 Jkt 042369 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\052108\42369 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

47

shrimp  that  does  not  contain  the  kinds  of  constituents  that  we
might see coming in from overseas.

Mr. INGLIS. And maintaining that crop in the ocean, I guess, has
another—speaking  of  antibiotics  and  pharmaceuticals,  I  take  it  we
are  doing  some  research  on  that  sort  of  thing  too  through  Sea
Grant  on  whether  sewage  effluent  is  actually  affecting  the  repro-
duction  of  shrimp  and  other  kinds  of  species.  Is  that  something
that Sea Grant does or, do you have any research going on in that?
Mr. DEVOE. I think that varies, depending on what region of the
country  you  look.  I  know  I  can  only  speak  for  South  Carolina,  my
region.  The  issues  of  stormwater  runoff  are  extremely  important,
even  though  we  are  a  relatively  flat  state,  I  mean,  in  terms  of
slope. There is still, during rainfall events, we will get a lot of run-
off,  and  there  are  a  lot  of  materials  that  do  run  off  into  our  sys-
tems. We are concerned about that because the species that inhabit
our estuaries and our tidal creeks tend to spend their youngest por-
tions of their lives up in the upper headwaters of those creeks and
that  is  where  the  connections  are  between  the  land  and  what  is
running off in the water.

Coliform bacteria is of particular concern in terms of water qual-
ity  and  so  there  have  been  a  number  of  programs  throughout  the
country through Sea Grant’s coastal community program to look at
ways to manage stormwater on site or on land through various low-
impact  development  scenarios  and  other  things  to  try  to  minimize
the flow of that water off land into our fragile estuaries.

OFFSHORE WIND FARMS

Mr.  INGLIS.  I  grew  up  on  one  of  those  estuaries  actually  in

Bluffton, South Carolina.

One last question if I got time. Wind farms, Sea Grant does work

on how those may work offshore?

Mr. ANDERSON. Ocean-based wind farms?
Mr. INGLIS. Right
Mr. ANDERSON. I think again, like Mr. DeVoe said, that depends
on  the  region  and  the  states  that  are  involved.  Some  of  our  parts
of our country are way ahead of others in terms of harvesting wind.
Speaking for my region, there are engineers who have said that the
Gulf of Maine is the Middle East of wind and that we have to start
harvesting  wind  up  there.  There  is  a  lot  of  wind.  So  there  are  in-
deed  some  explorations  going  on  to  do  this  kind  of  thing  that  may
or  may  not  be  in  State  waters  but  certainly  in  federal  waters,  and
some of the technologies that we will need to come to bear on that,
the  water  is  too  deep  up  there.  They  will  have  to  be  tethered  and
floating  structures,  which  requires  a  tremendous  amount  of  new
thinking  around  engineering,  and  I  expect  my  program  to  be  ap-
proached by that class of scientists in the coming years and we will
entertain  research  proposals  and  try  to  feed  some  money  into  that
important issue if we have the money to feed.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Inglis.  I  was  thinking  but

I will hold my tongue for a bit.

Mr. Bartlett, you are recognized.

CONSERVATION AND STEWARDSHIP

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Thank  you  very  much  for  your  testimony.  I  re-
ceived  both  my  master’s  and  my  doctorate  from  a  university  that
had a land grant college, and I don’t know all the reasons why the
College  of  Agriculture  was  one  of  the  better  schools  in  the  univer-
sity,  and  although  my  degree  was  from  the  College  of  Arts  and
Sciences,  I  took  many  of  my  courses  in  the  School  of  Agriculture
because  they  had  better  teachers  and  better  courses.  My  course  in
advanced  embryology  was  reproduction  in  poultry,  for  instance.
Well,  as  a  result  of  this  focus,  more  than  50  years  ago  our  univer-
sity, the School of Agriculture, had an enormous focus on conserva-
tion and stewardship of our land.

My  perception  is  that  we  have  related  to  our  waters,  both  the
lakes  and  the  oceans,  as  if  they  were  endless  opportunities  for  ex-
ploitation  rather  than  resources  that  require  conservation  and
stewardship, and I am wondering if you believe the Sea Grant pro-
gram will eventually have the same kind of focus on our waters for
conservation  and  stewardship  that  the  land  grant  colleges  have
brought  to  our  land  masses.  I  think  there  is  increasing  evidence
that  if  we  don’t  have  that  kind  of  focus,  the  opportunities  for  ex-
ploitation  are  going  to  be  diminished  in  the  future.  What  do  you
see?

Mr.  MCLEAN.  Mr.  Bartlett,  if  I  may,  I  think  that  the  direction
that  the  Sea  Grant  program  is  going  in,  and  to  a  certain  dem-
onstrated extent has been, is to achieve a balance between the pro-
ductivity  of  oceans  and  coastal  environments  and  then  to  make
sure  that  that  productivity  is  in  fact  sustainable.  It  can  only  be
sustainable by having an appropriately targeted conservation ethic
and  I  think  the  research  that  Sea  Grant  undertakes  is  targeted  to
be  community  responsive  and  constituent  responsive.  Most  of  our
coastal  constituents  are  very  aware  of  the  facts  around  us  regard-
ing water quality and the availability of healthful seafood resources
or other harvestable resources that come from the sea. I think con-
servation  and  productivity  are  very  closely  tied.  The  science  that
Sea Grant does reinforces this message and I think the new direc-
tion,  or  I  should  say,  the  enhanced  direction  of  our  strategic  plan
from Sea Grant and the individual Sea Grant institutes, the 32 in-
stitutes that comprise the program, are really targeting that direc-
tion  that  we  need  to  be  sustainable,  we  need  to  be  conservation-
minded  but  we  also  need  to  balance  that  with  the  productivity  of
the coastal communities and even the products that are shipped in-
land  to  other  parts  that  are  away  from  the  coast.  But  our  coast  is
our engine and we need to protect it. We need to protect it in terms
of  the  resources,  its  sustainability  and  the  coastal  communities
that rely on it. I appreciate your acknowledgement of that area.

Mr.  DEVOE.  I  would  like  to,  if  I  may,  offer  a  perspective.  Sea
Grant  was  created  in  the  1960s  and  it  was  to  foster  wise  use  and
conservation  of  coastal,  marine  and  Great  Lakes  resources.  So  I
think  the  ethic  that  you  describe  is  embodied  in  the  program  and
it  has  been  since  the  beginning.  I  think  what  we  are  dealing  with
today  is—not  today  but  over  the  last  few  decades—is  the  fact  that
the  coast  and  the  oceans  and  the  Great  Lakes  have  become  much
more—more  and  more  attractive  for  people  to  come  live,  work  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:59 Sep 29, 2008 Jkt 042369 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\052108\42369 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

49

play  along,  and  the  challenge  that  we  have  as  the  Sea  Grant  pro-
gram but also all of us have, you know, as stewards of these areas
is to try to deal with that emerging pressure, those emerging pres-
sures to try to maintain that balance as we move forward. It is not
that we don’t have a philosophy, but the challenges for us as a rel-
atively modest program relative to the land grant system, which is
more  than  order  of  magnitude  higher  in  funding  that  the  Sea
Grant program is, does provide those challenges for us and may be
one of the reasons why we would really like to see some more sup-
port  for  the  program  at  the  federal  level  and  which  we  can  then
leverage that support at the State and local level.

Mr.  RILEY.  I  can  say  that  with  the  work  that  Sea  Grant  has
done,  especially  in  Texas  and  those  involved  in  it,  that  they  have
shepherded the fishing community, which I am involved in, into be-
coming  more  sustainable  and  ecologically  friendly.  We  are  a  little
bit  unique  in  the  company  I  am  managing  in  that  we  are  diversi-
fied  and  have  the  funds  available  to  do  a  little  bit  of  research  and
become more efficient in our own harvesting, and at times some of
that  research  has  paved  the  way  for  Sea  Grant  to  get  out  into  in-
dustry as, you know, a greater whole and they have done an excel-
lent  job  of  trying  to  foster  an  attitude  amongst  commercial
shrimpers in the Gulf to become more aware, become more sustain-
able.  Of  course,  the  key  word  these  days  in  any  fishing  enterprise
is  sustainability  but  they  have  done  an  excellent  job  of,  you  know,
fostering that line of thought and getting it out into industry.

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

DIVERSITY OF PARTICIPATION
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Bartlett.
Our  second  round,  and  I  will  recognize  myself  for  five  minutes.
Mr. McLean, in the last reauthorization, the language was added
to  the  provision  on  fellowships  to  ensure  equal  access  for  minority
and  economically  disadvantaged  students.  How  successful  was  the
Sea Grant program or has it been in their efforts to involve minor-
ity-serving  institutions  and  in  the  efforts  to  increase  the  diversity
of students participating in the Sea Grant program?

Mr.  MCLEAN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  The  addition  of  that
language  is  a  very  important  opportunity  for  us.  We  recognize  in
our  workforce  that  we  do  not  have  currently  in  the  ocean  and
coastal  professions  the  construct  of  full  representation  throughout
the  image  of  America  in  our  own  workforce  and  we  are  working
very  hard  to  change  the  distribution,  the  appeal  and  the  avail-
ability  of  opportunities  to  students  from  all  universities  and  all
areas.  We  have  linkages  with  minority-serving  institutions  in  the
Sea  Grant  program,  in  particularly  in  the  southern  end  in  the
southeast  area  of  South  Carolina  State,  which  was  mentioned  ear-
lier,  is  a  minority-serving  institute  and  is  part  of  the  South  Caro-
lina  Sea  Grant  Institute  and  also  we  have  Jackson  State  in  Mis-
sissippi  and  I  have  worked  personally  very  closely  with  Jackson
State in bringing scientists aboard our NOAA ships and throughout
our  science  programs.  I  don’t  have  a  statistic  or  a  number  that  I
could  report  to  you  but  I  can  assure  you  that  our  efforts  are  ongo-
ing.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  that  that  language  has  given  us
in  order  to  sustain  our  efforts  to  recruit  a  broad  spectrum  of  stu-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:59 Sep 29, 2008 Jkt 042369 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\052108\42369 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

dents, and we even go further. We note that a few short years ago
the  distribution  of  women,  for  example,  in  the  Sea  Grant  fellow-
ship,  in  the  Knauss  Fellowship  Program  was  approaching  50/50  in
its  distribution  and  I  am  happy  to  recognize  now  that  the  respon-
siveness  in  the  students  that  we  are  placing  in  the  Knauss  fellow-
ship  are  now  75  percent  female,  and  we  are  trying  to  attain  the
same  sort  of  positive  growth  in  the  direction  of  under-represented
communities  of  students  in  our  workforce  and  we  think  that  the
Sea Grant fellowships are a marvelous way to accomplish that.

We  have  additional  programs  in  NOAA  that  the  Congress  has
supported  routinely,  and  they  represent  educational  partnership
programs where we directly tie with additional minority-serving in-
stitutes. We have created Centers of Excellence in schools that are
developing  their  programs  in  particular  academic  disciplines  that
reach  NOAA  sciences  and  NOAA-related  sciences  atmospherically
and oceanically. We are working hard in that direction, and I think
you can appreciate the change, the size of the rudder that we need
to  be  turning  is  quite  significant  but  we  are  working  earnestly  at
it.

MATCHING FUNDS REQUIREMENT

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you. One of the provisions of the Ad-
ministration’s  proposal  is  the  matching  fund  requirements  for  the
regional  and  national  partnerships.  The  Administration  is  pro-
posing that the partnerships as well as the interagency cooperation
be  exempt  from  the  matching  fund  requirement.  The  matching
fund  requirement  has  provided  leverage  for  the  State  programs  to
achieve  all  that  they  have  thus  far.  So  without  these  matching
funds, where is the funding going to come from to do these collabo-
rative projects? Anyone?

Mr.  ANDERSON.  Well,  I  will  speak  to  that.  The  matching  compo-
nent of the Sea Grant program has long been a hallmark of its con-
struct and it is an important way for bringing our universities and
our  states  to  the  issues.  Some  of  the  challenges  of  doing  institu-
tional  arrangements  and  regional  approaches  that  we  have  talked
about  earlier  in  the  hearing  have  been  encumbered  by  this  match-
ing  requirement  because  administratively  we  end  up  with  negotia-
tions  and  some  delicacies  between  institutions  and  between  states
about  trying  to  meet  these  administrative  obligations  of  matching
and the fiscal arrangements that have to be set up to accommodate
for  that.  Sometimes  they  become  a  distraction  to  the  real  science
and  the  real  approach  that  we  ought  to  be  taking  so  I  think  that
there is value to considering this exemption so that we are able to
focus on the work to be done and be able to bring the right players
to  the  table  and  we  still  have  the  opportunity  through  our  institu-
tional  arrangements  to  bring  other  resources  to  bear  and  make
sure  that  it  is  an  efficient  arrangement.  But  I  think  that  that  is
some of the motive behind this change.

COLLABORATION WITH NMFS

Chairman LAMPSON. How close do you all work with the National

Marine Fisheries Service?

Mr.  ANDERSON.  I  think  that  varies  around  the  country  but  in
some cases very, very closely, helping them with training and edu-
cation of their council members. There has been many collaborative
research  science  projects  with  some  of  the  fisheries’  management
councils.  I  think  that  that  relationship  varies  around  the  regions
and based on some particularly challenging issues that some of our
regions have had. Sea Grant is a science, unbiased—science-based,
unbiased  broker  and  a  convener  and  I  think  the  fisheries’  councils
have  recognized  that  and  brought  us  in  when  they  can  to  help  us.
Chairman LAMPSON. Do we need to work on that more so? There
is concern, and I would like for you to comment, if you don’t mind,
Mr.  Riley,  on  some  of  this  because  I  know  that  there  are  a  lot  of
fishermen, particularly in the western Gulf of Mexico, who are con-
cerned about some of the work that NMFS has done as far as snap-
per and snapper seasons and I know that that is the case in other
places,  and  I  know  that  your  industry  gets  some  of  the  brunt  of
some  of  the  problem.  But  is  there  a  way  that—some  say  that
NMFS  has  too  many  folks  that  sit  at  desks  and  laboratories  and
don’t  know  enough  about  what  is  happening  on  the  water  and  it
sounds  like  you  guys  know  more  about  what  is  going  on  in  the
water.  Is  there  a  way  to  build  that  collaboration  to  a  greater  ex-
tent?

Mr.  RILEY.  I  think  in  our  case,  especially  with  Texas  Sea  Grant
and  others  around  the  Gulf,  they  have  collaborated  well  with  Na-
tional  Marine  Fisheries  Service,  especially  out  of  Pascagoula  with
the harvesting lab there. They have done so much on development
of better TEDs, more efficient, you know, BRDs, or Bycatch Reduc-
tion  Devices,  which  speaks  to  that  snapper  problem.  But  the  prob-
lem is twofold in that snapper issue, and we would be here all day
talking  about  that,  but  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  I  think
bears too much of the brunt for what the Gulf Council in that par-
ticular  setting  has  done.  The  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service
has used some sound science, at the time it was the best available
science, which has changed, to make recommendations, and in that
particular  situation,  the  Gulf  Council  has  not  always  heeded  those
recommendations and have set harvest levels above what even Na-
tional  Marine  Fisheries  Service  was  recommending.  So,  you  know,
they  have  become  a  scapegoat  on  that  issue.  But  I  do  know  that
there  is  great  collaboration  right  now  of  getting  new  BRDs  out  in
the  industry  and  the  harvesting  lab,  which  has  purchased  several
thousand  of  three  different  types  of  devices,  it  is  using  the  Sea
Grant  college  program  and  the  Gulf  and  South  Atlantic  Fisheries
Foundation to get those out to the individual fishermen in different
ports and that is a pretty good program to introduce them to some
of  these  more  efficient  BRDs.  Otherwise  they  would  not  be  doing
on their own just due to the cost constraints involved.

FISHING INDUSTRY CHALLENGES

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  am  way  over  my  time,  but  if  you  would
just  comment  briefly  as  you  can  for  me  on  the  challenges  that  you
face  in  this  industry  that  you  are  involved  with,  and  whether  or
not  Sea  Grant  is  well  positioned  to  help  address  some  of  those
issues in the future.

Mr. RILEY. Well, the biggest two challenges we face are high cost
of inputs and low cost of product that we are putting on the market
due to, you know, global competition. Nobody in this room is doing
very  well  with  $4-a-gallon  diesel,  and  Sea  Grant  has  been  doing  a
great job of getting some of this gear that we kind of developed in-
house but getting it out to the fishery as a whole to keep them, you
know,  fishing  at  a  sustainable  level.  If  you  take  the  30  percent
mark  at  $4  a  gallon,  that  boat  can  operate  as  if  it  is  using  fuel  at
$2.80 a gallon, and that is pretty significant.

And also in the development and research we are doing on these
BRDs,  we  are  starting  to  have  an  issue  now  of  crewing  issues.  We
can’t find willing participants to get on these boats for the lengths
of  time  we  are  asking  them  to  do  it,  and  we  are  understaffed  at
times  during  high-volume  periods,  and  it  would  behoove  us  to  be-
come  more  efficient  with  what  we  bring  up,  basically  bring  more
of  the  target  species  up  and  eliminate  anything  else  before  it  gets
on  the  back  deck  to  make  it  easier  on  the  crews,  and  that  is  one
aspect  we  have  kind  of  taken  in-house  at  Western,  and  Sea  Grant
has  done  an  excellent  job  through  their  Fishery  Extension  Service
to, you know, foster that kind of thinking too amongst others.

MORE ON OFFSHORE WIND FARMS

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Mr. Inglis.
Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Back  to  the  offshore  wind  farm  concept,  I  understand  that  Min-
erals  Management  Service  very  recently,  May  19,  closed  public
comment  and  competing  nominations  for  interim  leases  for  data
collection  and  research  for  some  five-year  leases.  It  is  pretty  excit-
ing  to  be  moving  forward  in  that.  And  one  of  the  challenges,  as  I
understand  it,  is  transmitting  the  power—if  you  do  it  offshore,
transmitting  the  power  back  to  shore  is  pretty  expensive  and  you
lose  some  energy  that  way.  Any  research  you  know  that  is  going
on  in  that  regard  or  perhaps  somehow  storing  the  energy  some
other  way  or  turning  it  into  something  else  out  there  and  then
bringing it in some way besides a power line?

Mr. MCLEAN. It is not an area that NOAA is actively working in
although  I  think  the  nature  of  the  assessments  that  Sea  Grant
science has supported is to identify where are the most wind-prone
areas  that  could  be  reliable  generators  of  wind,  and  I  believe  that
also  in  Oregon  Sea  Grant  there  are  projects  that  are  looking  at
wave-generated energies. But in terms of the actual electrical engi-
neering  component  of  that  challenge,  that  would  exceed  our  exper-
tise.

Mr. ANDERSON. I am sorry to say that I am not familiar with any
particular institutions, certainly not mine, that are working in that
world,  it  is  probably  superconductivity  kinds  of  research,  but  I  am
sure somewhere there is.

Mr. DEVOE. No, I am not familiar with that either, sir.
Mr. ANDERSON. I could look into that for you and get back to you

if you would like.

Mr.  INGLIS.  I  guess  probably  a  place  that  you  all  may  get  more
involved  is,  there  are  issues  involving  species,  impact  on  species
about  having  the  wind  farms  out  there  and  that  sort  of  thing.  Of

course, I suppose if you are looking at fisheries, it is a great oppor-
tunity  because  suddenly  they  got  a  place  to  live.  But  I  guess  for
birds and that sort of thing, there is a little bit of a challenge. Any-
body  know  of  any  research  that  you  all  are  doing  in  that  regard?
Mr. ANDERSON. I will just say that you are certainly correct that
that is an avenue that Sea Grant programs can help to bring some
researchers  and  other  science  capacity  to  those  issues  around  the
conflict,  the  conflicting  use,  and  certainly  in  the  Northeast  there
have been some issues around a wind farm offshore near Cape Cod.
I  believe  our  colleagues  in  Massachusetts,  the  Sea  Grant  commu-
nity  and  others,  have  been  helping  to  bring  those  perspectives  to
the table and try to help these people sort out, yes, the science and
what are the technical challenges that we have to address but also
the  other  social  science  conflicts  and  Sea  Grant’s  deep  experience
of  bringing  people  together  to  help  them  understand  and  work
through perspectives, so that we can learn to understand why other
people have a differing perspective. Because in some ways, I think
you  are  quite  right,  that  is  going  to  be  one  of  the  big  challenges
of getting these kinds of new innovative energy generation systems
up and running, whether they are on the ocean or terrestrial.

Mr. DEVOE. If I may, just one brief comment on that. One thing
is that—two things. One is that the kind of research that would be
needed  to,  you  know,  enhance  transfer  of  energy  from  offshore  to
onshore  probably  would  exceed  the  capacity  of  the  Sea  Grant  pro-
gram  as  a  whole.  I  just  think  it  is  very  high-level  and  very  expen-
sive,  very  important,  you  know,  type  of  research  and  I  support
what  Paul  and  Craig  have  said  about  that.  It  is  traditionally  not
an  area  that  Sea  Grant  has  engaged.  However,  a  play  on  a  little
bit  of  what  Paul  mentioned  is  the  fact  that  what—any  kind  of  off-
shore  energy  development  will  require  an  onshore  base  of  oper-
ation. So we will be dealing with these issues if they emerge, if this
potential  is  actually  realized,  whether  it  is  wind  or  waves  or  cur-
rents or maybe even back to traditional, you know, gas exploration,
that sort of thing. It is going to have some effect on the coasts, and
that  is  not  a  qualitative  comment.  It  is  just,  it  is  going  to  have
some effect on the coasts because they are going to need an on-land
coastal  base  of  operation.  I  think  that  is  where  we  are  going  to  be
able  to  play  a  much  more  significant  role  in  working  with  commu-
nities to help them think about how they want to shape that devel-
opment.  One  of  the  provisions  of  the  energy  bill,  if  I  am  not  mis-
taken,  and  I  might  be  really  off  on  this  because  I  am  not  that  fa-
miliar  with  it,  was  that  there—and  I  don’t  think  this  component
passed, was a requirement that an onshore base of operation could
be identified but couldn’t sway more than 50 miles one direction or
another,  and  that  puts  a  huge,  sort  of  a  huge  challenge  to  that
community  or  those  communities  that  are  within  that  zone  to  try
to  accommodate  that  kind  of  development.  So  the  onshore  connec-
tion  is,  in  my  mind,  in  my  opinion,  and  we  have  acknowledged  it
in  our  strategic  plan,  is  something  that  we  will  probably  have  to
do  as  a  state  or  have  to  deal  with  as  a  state  and  the  best  way  to
do  that,  as  has  been  mentioned,  is  to  bring  the  partners  to  the
table and try to work through these challenges.

Mr.  INGLIS.  If  you  could  work  through  as  you  did  the  turtle  ex-
truder  question  and  bring  those  parties  together,  then  there  is
hope.

Mr. DEVOE. That might be easier.
Mr. INGLIS. Yes, that would be easier, I think.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Bartlett, further questions?

COOPERATION BETWEEN SEA AND LAND-BASED PROGRAMS

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much.
There is an old adage that says what is everybody’s responsibility
is  nobody’s  responsibility,  and  this  reality  impacts  you  in  two  dif-
ferent venues. On the land side, you quite literally get dumped on.
Most  of  my  district,  the  water  flows  into  the  Chesapeake  Bay.  I
have  no  land  bordering  the  Chesapeake  Bay  but  we  are  acutely
aware  of  what  we  do  on  our  land  really  impacts  the  health  of  the
bay.  Then  when  you  get  out  into  the  oceans,  our  territorial  waters
run,  depending  upon  where  you  sit,  three  miles  or  20  miles,  I
guess, and that is only a tiny percent of the whole oceans out there
and  so  the  health  of  our  national  waters  depends  a  great  deal  on
internationally what is going on in the rest of the ocean. What kind
of  success  are  you  having  at  forging  partnerships  on  the  land  side
so  that  you  don’t  get  dumped  on  and  on  the  ocean  side  so  that  we
don’t get depleted because of excess harvesting by others?

Mr.  ANDERSON.  I  will  speak  to  one  particular  partnership  that
the  National  Sea  Grant  Program  was  able  to  cultivate  with  the
EPA over the last couple of years, and more speaking to how coast-
al  communities  or  even  communities  up  in  the  watershed  such  as
yours  are  planning  their  development,  planning  their  futures
around  honoring  ecosystem  principles.  We  call  this  smart  growth,
and  that  is  the  jargon  that  is  being  kicked  around,  but  nationally,
Sea Grant created a partnership program with EPA and both insti-
tutions  with  some  NOAA  money  and  EPA  money  were  able  to  get
going  some  competitive  programs  around  the  country  to  start
bringing  communities  together  and  say  all  right,  where  are  we
going  to  have  these  kinds  of  activities,  you  know,  thinking  about
things  like  impervious  surfaces  and  agricultural  development  and
other  kinds  of  stormwater  treatment,  stormwater  management,
and try to do that in a collaborative, interdisciplinary way because
oftentimes,  as  Mr.  DeVoe  referred  to  earlier,  whereas  a  lot  of  our
really important coastal decisions around ecological health are hap-
pening in a town and a municipality. We need to bring municipali-
ties together and get them to think about these issues because they
are  living  in  a  watershed  together  and  so  the  smart  growth  pro-
gram  is  just  one  example  of  trying  to  bring  those  towns  together
and learn some science principles and learn some best management
practices, and Sea Grant has been—we really—our role in that was
bringing all the players together. You have heard that in all of our
little stories here this morning, that our role is convening and get-
ting  people  to  understand  one  another’s  perspectives.  So  that  is
perhaps an example of something that we are trying to do to effect
what you are talking about.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Let  me  give  you  just  one  example  of  something
that we do on the land which I think is really dumb, which impacts

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:59 Sep 29, 2008 Jkt 042369 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\052108\42369 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

the quality of our waters. If you are not near a municipality so that
you  have  public  water  and  sewer,  the  only  land  that  you  can  de-
velop is by definition farmland because it can’t slope more than 25
percent  or  they  won’t  perk  it,  and  it  has  to  perk  or  they  won’t  let
you  build  on  it.  Land  that  slopes  less  than  25  percent  and  perks
is by definition farmland, isn’t it? And then when you put in a sep-
tic system, by law, they require you to take the effluent and inject
it into the ground under the root zone of plants, and then they are
distressed  that  there  is  an  increase  in  nitrogen  level  because  this
nutrient which the plants would happily take up is now by law in-
jected into the ground. It is not a recycling system. It is a disposal
system  and  it  is  spawned  of  ignorance.  What  can  you  all  do  to
change  that?  And  by  the  way,  you  don’t  need  either  a  well  or
ground which perks to build a house. More than enough water falls
on  the  roof  of  your  house  to  meet  all  of  your  needs  for  the  year  if
you  husband  it.  You  don’t  have  to  be  really  rationing  very  much.
And  we  now  have  composting  toilets  so  that  you  could  build  your
house  out  on  the  middle  of  the  freeway  when  that  gets  abandoned
because gas is too expensive. You could live very happily there. You
know,  what  can  you  all  do  to  bring  some  sanity  to  our  land-based
programs so that we aren’t polluting the groundwater?

Mr.  MCLEAN.  Mr.  Bartlett,  thank  you  for  that  question.  I  can’t
promise you an exact solution but I could demonstrate the method-
ology  that  the  Sea  Grant  program  has  taken  in  order  to  unite  the
heartland of the country with the coastal community and how what
happens in the heart of the country or in the center of the country
is  being  deposited,  for  example,  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  where
we have certain introductions of materials that aren’t naturally oc-
curring  and  they  are  having  an  environmental  consequence  in  the
Gulf  of  Mexico.  In  Oklahoma,  in  Norman,  Oklahoma,  we  have  es-
tablished a position for a Sea Grant extension agent, and although
Oklahoma’s  time  as  a  maritime  state  is  quite  dated,  geological  ep-
ochs  ago,  and  the  fossil  evidence  is  of  course  there,  we  are  very
proud  to  see  that  Sea  Grant  had  the  leadership  and  the  forward
thinking  to  be  bringing  a  representative,  an  outreach  representa-
tive  who  can  communicate  the  challenges  of  the  farming  commu-
nity  to  the  coastal  community  and  the  coastal  community  back  to
the farming community. We are also looking there, and the purpose
for  this  person’s  arrival  was  to  build  understanding  for  coastal  re-
siliency,  hazard  resiliency,  but  certainly  one  of  the  threats  to  the
coastal  community  are  depositions,  dumping  and  the  like  that
takes place in other locations.

But  my  point  is  to  impress  upon  you  the  flexibility  of  the  Sea
Grant  program  and  how  we  can  bring  various  fields  of  knowledge
to communities that aren’t normally running into that conversation
and I am hopeful that we could be doing more of this in the future.

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Bartlett.
Mr. Akin, would you like to be recognized?
Mr. AKIN. I didn’t have any questions for the moment, especially

after Roscoe’s eloquence here.

RAINWATER AS A DRINKING SOURCE

ment?

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  could  have  just  a  moment  to
note  something.  I  wanted  to  do  a  development  where  we  were
using rainwater from your house and it went into a cistern and the
State people told me oh, you can’t do that, you can’t use rainwater.
I  said  help  me  understand  this.  The  rain  falls  on  the  hog  lot  and
then  the  water  goes  from  the  hog  lot  into  the  creek  and  the  creek
goes into the reservoir and you pull it out of the reservoir and treat
it  a  little  and  tell  me  that  is  drinking  water.  I  said  can  I  please
have the water before it goes through the hog lot.

Now,  we  really  have  some  really  silly  regulations,  and  I  hope
that through your interest in maintaining the quality of our waters
that you can counsel with our land people that they get some san-
ity into their regulations.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Mr.  DeVoe,  you  wanted  to  make  a  com-

Mr.  DEVOE.  Thank  you,  just  to  comment  on  that,  just  to  follow
on with Mr. McLean’s comment about Norman, Oklahoma. The Sea
Grant  program  has  established  recently,  formally  established,  a
coastal  communities  program,  and  what  the  national  office  has
done is, provided some limited resources, which I think a lot of our
programs  have  leveraged,  to  develop  capacity  to  have  a  special  ex-
tension person but not in fisheries but in coastal development, and
every  state  is  addressing  their  issues,  you  know,  in  the  way  that
is  most  appropriate  for  their  states.  But  we  have  mechanisms  in
place throughout the Sea Grant network now where these are folks
who  are  planners  or  they  may  have  expertise  in  stormwater  man-
agement or some aspect of development. Paul mentioned the smart
growth thing, low-impact developments, some of these new ways of
trying  to  deal  with  both  existing  developments  and  trying  to  mini-
mize  runoff  or  new  developments,  to  try  to  incorporate  technology
into the development of those.

But  I  would  submit  to  you  that  as  frustrating  as  this  is  to  me
and  a  lot  of  us,  is  that  science  only  goes  so  far.  We  can  provide  as
much of the best information with the best rationale that we could
ever  come  up  with  and  these  decisions  are  not  just  science  deci-
sions.  There  are  other  considerations  that  decision-makers  have  to
take into account when they make those. So I think we try as best
we  can  to  present  the  best  information  that  we  can  generate
through  our  universities  and  get  it  to  you  and  other  decision-mak-
ers  in  a  fashion  that  is  usable  and  understandable  and  then  we
sort  of  have  to  sit  back  and  see  what  happens  and  see  how  the
process works out.

Our engagement with citizens and schools is a way to build that
public awareness and it may be through a public perspective, there
may  be  ways  to  change  perceptions  and  also  decision-making.  But
it is one of the challenges that we face as a science and information
organization.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  And  I  guess  Mr.  Bartlett  would  look  for

common sense in some of these things.

Mr. BARTLETT. I would. There is not a whole lot of that out there.
Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Akin.

STATEMENT OF JOHN T. WOESTE

VICE CHAIR, NATIONAL SEA GRANT REVIEW PANEL,
OFFICE OF OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH,

NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION,

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON FISHERIES AND OCEANS

COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

APRIL 3, 2008

I  am  Dr.  John  T.  Woeste,  Professor  Emeritus  and  retired  Dean  of  the  University
of  Florida’s  Institute  of  Food  and  Agriculture  Sciences.  I  serve  as  Vice  Chair  of  the
National  Sea  Grant  Review  Panel,  a  Federal  Advisory  Committee  comprised  of  15
individuals  who  advise  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  through  the  Under  Secretary  of
Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, and the Director of the National Sea Grant
College  Program  on  scientific  and  administrative  policy.  The  Panel  functions  as  an
advisory  body  in  accordance  with  the  Federal  Advisory  Committee  Act  (FACA).  The
National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  is  NOAA’s  primary  university-based  program
in  support  of  coastal  resource  use  and  conservation.  Sea  Grant’s  research,  outreach
and  education  programs  promote  better  understanding,  conservation  and  use  of
America’s marine and coastal resources.

I  am  pleased  to  be  here  today  to  tell  you  about  the  National  Sea  Grant  College
Program. Specifically, I will discuss the role of the National Sea Grant Review Panel
(Panel),  Sea  Grant’s  leadership  and  the  program’s  return  on  investment,  enhance-
ments  to  Sea  Grant’s  evaluation  process,  the  importance  of  continuing  this  vibrant
program, and the Panel’s role in the future.

The  Panel  recognizes  the  vision  and  important  role  that  past  Congresses  have
played  in  enacting  the  Sea  Grant  Act  and  its  subsequent  reauthorizations.  Thank
you for your support of this program, for your recognition of the importance of sus-
tainable  coasts  to  the  U.S.,  and  for  your  confidence  in  Sea  Grant  as  part  of  achiev-
ing that vision.

Establishment of the Sea Grant Review Panel

The  Sea  Grant  Review  Panel  was  established  by  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  as
directed  by  Section  209  of  the  National  Sea  Grant  Program  Act  of  1976.  The  Panel
advises  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  acting  through  the  Under  Secretary  of  Com-
merce  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere  and  the  Director  of  the  National  Sea  Grant  Col-
lege Program with respect to: Applications or proposals for, and performance under,
grants  and  contracts  awarded;  the  Sea  Grant  fellowship  program;  the  designation
and  operation  of  Sea  Grant  Colleges  and  Sea  Grant  institutes,  and  the  operation
of  Sea  Grant  programs;  the  formulation  and  application  of  the  planning  guidelines
and  priorities  established  by  the  Secretary;  and  other  matters  as  the  Secretary,
Under Secretary, or Director refer to the Panel for review and advice. The body con-
sists of fifteen voting members appointed by the Secretary.

The Panel, in its advisory role, worked closely with the National Sea Grant Office
and  the  Sea  Grant  Directors,  through  the  Sea  Grant  Association  (SGA),  to  address
areas of concern related to this reauthorization, and to seek consensus on the issues.
A  series  of  joint  meetings  and  conversations  helped  to  philosophically  align  Sea
Grant’s three leadership bodies and generate widespread consensus on proposed po-
sitions. The Panel also considered several reports relevant to the legislation: ‘‘Build-
ing Sea Grant: The Role of the National Sea Grant Office,’’ a 2002 Panel report pro-
viding  a  review  and  analysis  of  the  organization,  administration,  and  management
of  the  NSGO;  and,  the  National  Research  Council  (NRC)  report,  ‘‘Evaluation  of  the
Sea Grant Review Process’’ (2006), which assessed the impact of Sea Grant’s evalua-
tion  process  and  procedures  on  the  organization  as  a  whole.  As  the  National  Sea
Grant  College  Program  implements  the  NRC  report  and  realizes  its  new  national
strategic plan, ‘‘NOAA National Sea Grant College Program, Strategic Action Agen-
da  2009–2013:  Meeting  the  Challenge,’’  collaboration  among  the  three  leadership
bodies  will  be  further  enhanced,  better  positioning  the  program  as  a  powerful  and
coordinated  national  leader  in  research  and  education  for  the  sustainable  develop-
ment of Great Lakes, marine and coastal resources.

Sea Grant Leadership

72

The  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  has  become  a  leader  in  advancing  the
science  and  practice  of  managing  our  coastal  and  marine  resources.  The  program
last  had  its  legislation  reauthorized  unanimously  by  Congress  in  November  2002
with a virtual doubling of its authorized appropriation.

In order to meet some of the greatest challenges confronting our nation—namely,
urbanization and coastal development—Sea Grant has become strategically flexible,
creating  organizational  adaptability  and  responsiveness  through  an  open,  empow-
ered,  distributed  management  structure  focused  on  results  and  service  to  constitu-
ents.  These  management  changes,  implemented  over  the  past  decade,  have  en-
hanced  Sea  Grant’s  efficiency,  effectiveness,  overall  performance  and  user  input.
There is now a mind set of accountability against exacting performance criteria. As
a result, Sea Grant’s reputation has grown accordingly. The organization’s perform-
ance  scores  have  demonstrably  improved,  indicating  that  Sea  Grant  is  effectively
getting  resources  to  problems—the  right  problems  as  defined  by  both  NOAA’s  mis-
sion and constituent input.

A  major  report  from  the  Pew  Oceans  Commission  (2003)  noted,  ‘‘. . .  a  growing
crisis  in  America’s  oceans  and  along  our  coasts,’’  and  identified  nine  major  threats
to  oceans—several  of  which  Sea  Grant  is  well-positioned  to  address.  The  National
Sea  Grant  Law  Center  contributed  its  legal  expertise  to  the  Commission,  and  sev-
eral Sea Grant studies are also cited in the report.

The  environmental  challenges  and  Sea  Grant’s  role  in  the  emerging  U.S.  ocean
agenda  were  also  well  defined  in  the  U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy  (USCOP)
report published in late summer of 2004. Sea Grant received almost 50 citations in
the  USCOP  report,  including  a  specific  call  for  increases  in  budget  and  high  praise
for  Sea  Grant’s  educational  activities.  Sea  Grant  was  also  one  of  the  few  programs
named  in  the  President’s  2005  Ocean  Action  Plan  in  response  to  that  report.  This
recognition  is  eloquent  testimony  to  Sea  Grant’s  growing  impact  on  national  ocean
policy and research.

As  you  are  well  aware,  the  National  Ocean  Research  Priorities  Plan  (ORPP)  and
Implementation  Strategy  issued  by  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council’s
Joint  Subcommittee  on  Ocean  Science  and  Technology  on  January  26,  2007,  identi-
fies  research  priorities  and  calls  for  the  engagement  of  a  broad  array  of  ocean
science sectors to address high priority research needs and opportunities. Sea Grant
is ideally suited to implement regional ORPP and national priorities. Presently, Sea
Grant  is  developing  regional  research  plans  to  support  these  priorities.  These  re-
gional  research  and  information  planning  efforts  will  consider  the  full  scope  of
issues outlined in the U.S. Ocean Commission Report and Ocean Research Priorities
Plan  and  will  include  other  local,  State,  regional,  federal,  and  non-governmental
agencies.

As  further  testament  to  Sea  Grant’s  strong  leadership,  Dr.  Ronald  C.  Baird,
former Director of the National Sea Grant College Program, was awarded two Presi-
dential  Rank  Awards  for  Meritorious  Executives  (2000  and  2006)  for  his  work  in
helping to position the United States as a world leader in marine research and the
sustainable development of coastal resources. Dr. Baird would be the first to assert
that the great achievements of the National Sea Grant College Program contributed
to his successful nominations.

Sea  Grant’s  scientific  capabilities  and  forward-thinking,  innovative,  stakeholder-
focused organizational culture, coupled with performance-based accountability, have
earned it a reputation as a highly effective national program. Strong leadership and
an  ability  to  develop  partnerships  and  coalitions  among  federal,  academic  and  pri-
vate  sector  organizations  to  address  critical,  complex  issues,  characterizes  the  Sea
Grant program, and resides at the core of this nation’s ability to manage our coastal
resources as we confront unprecedented population growth and development.

Sea Grant’s Program Evaluation Process and Return on Investment

In  1994,  the  National  Research  Council  (NRC),  which  functions  under  the  aus-
pices of the National Academy of Sciences, reviewed the National Sea Grant College
Program. The NRC recommended several actions, including carrying out systematic,
periodic  reviews  of  the  individual  programs.  In  response,  Sea  Grant  developed  an
evaluation process that relied heavily on detailed site reviews carried out by an ex-
ternal Program Assessment Team every four years, beginning in 1998.

The  NSGO,  in  consultation  with  the  National  Sea  Grant  Review  Panel  and  the
Sea Grant programs, implemented this new program evaluation protocol. From 1998
through  2007,  the  Panel  conducted  59  program  reviews  and  provided  over  500  re-
view  recommendations  designed  to  enhance  and  improve  the  performance  of  each
Sea  Grant  program.  At  present,  the  Panel  is  pleased  to  report  that  approximately

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:59 Sep 29, 2008 Jkt 042369 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E08\052108\42369 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

73

95 percent of the program review recommendations have been implemented, result-
ing  in  a  healthy,  relevant,  rigorously  assessed  and  highly  productive  National  Sea
Grant College Program.

This  program  evaluation  process,  together  with  the  successful  implementation  of
program review recommendations, has produced, and continues to produce, substan-
tial  improvements  in  the  design,  direction,  operation  and  management  of  the  indi-
vidual State Sea Grant programs that comprise the National Sea Grant College Pro-
gram. The Panel’s intensive, on-site reviews of every program have affirmed our be-
lief in the quality of the Sea Grant programs, and formed a solid basis for our con-
viction  that  Sea  Grant’s  work  is  relevant  and  indispensable  to  achieving  the  Na-
tion’s vision for the future.

As a result of Sea Grant’s performance-based evaluation protocol, linking perform-
ance  to  merit-based  resource  incentives,  there  is  now  greatly  increased  account-
ability,  and  a  strong  commitment  to  continuous  program  improvement.  The  organi-
zation’s capacity to produce quality science and to support informed decision-making
with  research  information  is  formidable  and  demonstrative  of  Sea  Grant’s  commit-
ment to relevant service in the interest of our nation.

Performance  metrics  based  on  impacts  provide  accountability  for  Sea  Grant’s  re-
search, education and outreach programs. Sea Grant’s commitment to engaging the
best  scientific  expertise  within  coastal  and  Great  Lakes  states  and  regions  has  re-
sulted  in  exemplary  performance  and  results.  As  a  result,  Sea  Grant  impacts  have
brought  meaningful  benefits  to  the  Nation,  and  they  have  demonstrated  a  signifi-
cant  return  on  the  federal  dollar.  One  recent  example,  among  many,  makes  the
point. A protective mesh for clams developed by Sea Grant researchers and applied
by the industry has resulted in an increased yield valued at almost $40 million per
year to the New England clam industry.

Most impressive, however, is Sea Grant’s return on investment to U.S. taxpayers.
Sea  Grant  has  long  been  known  for  its  economic  contributions  and  positive  return
on investment. The organization’s non-federal matching requirement results in sub-
stantial  leveraging  of  additional  effort.  Each  Sea  Grant  program  must  generate
matching  funds  equal  to  at  least  50  percent  of  the  federal  investment.  The  Sea
Grant  programs’  ability  to  consistently  produce  match  funding  is  a  testament  to
their  responsiveness  as  well  as  to  their  relevance  to  the  needs  of  stakeholder  and
interest  groups.  Additional  financial  leverage  is  achieved  through  cooperative  part-
nerships with federal and State agencies. This ability to leverage resources and en-
gage issues in partnership with other entities, is, we believe, unparalleled in govern-
ment.

Sea  Grant  also  mobilizes  volunteers  to  participate  in  efforts  such  as  beach  clean-
ups,  aquatic  invasive  species  awareness  programs  and  water  quality  monitoring  ef-
forts.  In  one  state  alone,  Sea  Grant  saved  taxpayers  $120,000  in  the  annual  Beach
Sweep/River  Sweep  litter  cleanup  program.  Over  the  past  14  years,  more  than
75,000  volunteers  have  collected  728  tons  of  trash  and  have  saved  State  taxpayers
more  than  $1.6  million  as  part  of  that  effort.  Collectively,  thanks  to  Sea  Grant  ex-
tension  efforts  in  2007,  15  Sea  Grant  programs  worked  with  citizens  in  their  com-
munities who generated a total of 32,205 volunteer hours.

The  Panel  is  proud  that  the  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  is  one  of  few
federal  programs  to  have  implemented  such  a  rigorous  and  progressive  evaluation
protocol—a protocol that both promotes accountability and ensures ongoing and con-
tinuing  improvement—and  a  protocol  so  esteemed  that  it  has  significantly  influ-
enced internal evaluation procedures currently utilized by several other federal pro-
grams.  Through  this  evaluation  process  and  its  advisory  oversight,  the  Panel  has
sought  to  ensure  that  Sea  Grant  investments  address  the  ever-emerging  needs  of
the United States public and of the ecosystems in which they reside.

National Research Council Review (2006)

The National Sea Grant College Program Act Amendments of 2002 (P.L. 107–299)
directed  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  to  contract
with  the  NRC  a  second  time,  ten  years  after  its  1994  report,  to  conduct  a  review
of  the  evaluation  process  and  make  appropriate  recommendations  to  improve  its
overall effectiveness.

The subsequent NRC report, ‘‘Evaluation of the Sea Grant Review Process’’ (2006),
assessed  the  impact  of  the  new  procedures  and  evaluation  process  on  Sea  Grant  as
a whole. Among the areas considered were: the quality of work produced by the pro-
gram;  its  responsiveness  to  national,  regional  and  local  needs;  and,  the  quality  of
its  leadership,  management  and  reputation.  The  NRC  committee  was  also  asked  to
make  recommendations  for  improving  the  overall  effectiveness  of  the  evaluation
process  to  ensure  fairness,  consistency  and  enhancement  of  performance.  The  NRC

report includes recommendations that guide the improvement of an already success-
ful evaluation program.

The NRC concluded ‘‘real improvements have occurred’’ in the National Sea Grant
College  Program  since  changes  instituted  after  the  last  NRC  evaluation  in  1994.
The  NRC  further  stated  that  the  program  evaluation  process  established  in  1998
‘‘has led to improvements to the overall program.’’

Sea Grant’s Response to the NRC

In  response  to  the  set  of  24  NRC  recommendations,  Sea  Grant  is  developing  a
five-year  national  strategic  plan  and  an  Integrated  Planning,  Implementation  and
Evaluation (PIE) System. The PIE system reflects substantial input from the Panel
and the Sea Grant network through a variety of formal and informal processes.

The  new  integrated  planning  and  assessment  system  is  strongly  endorsed  by  the
Panel, in large part because it not only builds upon the former program assessment
process,  but  it  introduces  several  new  concepts  designed  to  better  integrate  Sea
Grant  planning  and  management  to  produce  significant  outcomes,  fulfill  program
accountability expectations and retain the initiative for continued program improve-
ment.  In  keeping  with  the  NRC’s  intent,  the  Panel  strongly  agrees  that  a  rigorous
and  competitive  program  evaluation  process  is  critical  to  Sea  Grant’s  success  as  a
strong, vibrant and accountable program.

The  National  Sea  Grant  College  Program  has  long  placed  a  premium  on  careful
planning  and  rigorous  evaluation  at  the  State  program  level  to  ensure  that  Sea
Grant would have the greatest impact at the constituent level. By developing a sys-
tem  that  capitalizes  on  these  capabilities  at  the  national  level,  Sea  Grant  will  be
able  to  enhance  its  impact  as  a  national  program.  The  Panel  also  feels  that  better
integration of planning, implementation and evaluation activities will maximize Sea
Grant’s  efficiency  at  all  levels,  making  the  best  use  of  limited  resources  and  pro-
viding increased benefits to the public. More specifically, the new system is intended
to separate aspects of the evaluation process focused on program improvement from
those  designed  to  rate  performance,  to  encourage  collaboration,  to  reward  perform-
ance,  to  provide  accountability,  to  retain  program  flexibility  to  address  local  issues,
and to increase efficiency.

Ranking Sea Grant Programs

The NRC expressed concern about the narrow focus on ranking programs and dis-
tributing competitive funds as impediments to the NSGO’s oversight role in improv-
ing  individual  programs.  The  Panel  agrees  with  the  NRC’s  conclusions  and  invites
Congress  to  consider  removing  the  statutory  provisions  for  ‘‘ranking’’  programs  as
directed in Section 1123, National Sea Grant College Act Amendments of 2002 (P.L.
107–299)  (‘‘rate  the  programs  according  to  their  relative  performance  into  no  less
than  five  categories,  with  each  of  the  two  best-performing  categories  containing  no
more than 25 percent of the programs.’’).

The ranking component included in the current legislation needs to be eliminated
because it has had the unintended consequence of providing a powerful disincentive
for  collaboration  within  the  Sea  Grant  network.  We  are  also  concerned  that  the  re-
quirement could impede desired regional and national cooperation.

Sea Grant’s Buying Power

The Panel also wishes to express concern over another impediment to Sea Grant’s
success. Despite rigorous reviews and accountability measures, and a strong, proven
program  that  represents  a  sound  investment  of  public  funds,  Sea  Grant’s  buying
power  continues  to  erode.  If  this  trend  continues,  the  promise  and  potential  of  Sea
Grant’s contributions and impacts to our nation will all but diminish.

The Panel believes that Congress got it right in 2002 when it last authorized the
Sea  Grant  program  at  its  2008  authorized  amount,  which  totals  $103,000,000  (Sec-
tion 1131(a) ). The Panel believes that this amount is necessary to meet our nation’s
ever  growing  marine  and  coastal  needs,  and  to  realize  Sea  Grant’s  promise  as  a
leader in helping our citizens address the issues with science-based information and
useful technologies. We note, Madam Chairwoman that the current appropriation is
$57,100,000, and that the appropriation has been no greater than $61,889,000 since
the 2002 Reauthorization.

To  illustrate  the  long-term  erosion  of  Sea  Grant’s  buying  power,  I  refer  you  to
three  charts  at  the  end  of  this  document  that  show  Sea  Grant’s  funding  history
since  1970.  Chart  1  shows  Sea  Grant’s  appropriated  funds  per  year,  and  except  for
the  past  three  years  the  data  depicts  a  modest  rise  in  Sea  Grant’s  appropriations
over  this  38-year  period.  Chart  2  shows  Sea  Grant’s  annual  appropriations  in  2007
dollars after adjusting for inflation by applying the Consumer Price Index (CPI). By

75

adjusting  for  inflation,  Chart  2  shows  a  modest  but  steady  decline  in  Sea  Grant’s
buying power since 1980. Most analysts agree that the deflator for research and de-
velopment has risen faster than the CPI. Chart 3 shows Sea Grant’s appropriations
in  2007  dollars  by  using  a  CPI  plus  2%  deflator,  which  represents  a  hypothetical
but  realistic  deflator  for  research  and  development  expenditures.  Chart  3  more
clearly  illustrates  the  serious  and  significant  decline  in  Sea  Grant  buying  power
since  1980.  Currently,  Sea  Grant  would  require  a  $190,000,000  appropriation  to
have the level of buying power it had in 1972, its peak year when adjusted for infla-
tion.  As  a  result  of  recent  in-depth  analysis,  the  Panel  has  become  very  concerned
about the trends, contributing factors and appropriate measures to reverse these de-
clines  in  the  face  of  mounting  concerns  for  our  nation’s  coastal  and  marine  re-
sources.

Strong National Leadership

This disappointing fiscal trend has limited Sea Grant’s ability to apply its unique
combination  of  resources  to  address  the  ever-growing  challenges  facing  the  marine
and coastal environment and the coastal economies dependent on this environment.
Additionally, because of the five percent legislative cap on the administration of pro-
grams  imposed  by  current  legislation,  the  National  Sea  Grant  Office  currently  has
40 percent fewer staff than it had in 1991 (29.0 vs. 17.4 Full-Time Equivalents).

The  Panel  reviewed  the  role  of  the  National  Sea  Grant  Office  twice  since  2002,
(Duce, 2002; and, Heath, in preparation for implementation of the national strategic
plan  and  PIE  system).  Both  reviews  concluded  that  staff  erosion  has  seriously  di-
minished  the  NSGO’s  ability  to  provide  the  national  leadership  necessary  to  ade-
quately support the Sea Grant network, and to represent the network within NOAA
and  at  the  national  level.  The  Panel’s  analysis  shows  that  an  increase  in  the  cap
on the administration of programs from the current level of five percent to the high-
er  level  of  seven  percent  is  necessary  to  enable  the  NSGO  to  effectively  fulfill  its
program  leadership  and  inter-agency  coordination  roles.  Shorting  those  roles,  we
fear,  misses  opportunities  for  the  meaningful  linkage  of  federal  agency  resources
with  optimum  program  integration  and  partnership  efforts  and  opportunities  ad-
dressing pressing national concerns.

Sea  Grant  must  increase  its  participation  and  leadership  for  ocean  and  coastal
issues  at  the  national  level—a  fundamental  responsibility  of  the  NSGO.  Over  the
past  several  years,  the  NSGO  has  been  unable  to  initiate  and  maintain  the  same
level  of  strategic  partnerships  with  other  federal  agencies  and  NGOs  as  in  years
past.  If  Sea  Grant’s  ‘‘beltway’’  presence  continues  to  diminish,  the  Panel  is  con-
cerned  that  significant  opportunities  to  leverage  resources  will  be  lost,  and  that  in
the long-term, Sea Grant’s visibility, reputation and capacity will suffer.

Enhancing  the  NSGO’s  capabilities  is  not  possible  with  the  current  five  percent
cap.  In  order  to  provide  strategic  leadership  and  effective  program  administration
and support, Sea Grant’s stature and participation at the national level must be en-
hanced  significantly.  As  Sea  Grant  implements  its  new  national  strategic  plan  and
the  recommendations  of  the  NRC,  there  will  be  strategic  focus  areas  that  require
national  leadership  and  coordination,  and  a  rigorous  evaluation  process  to  oversee
and  manage—roles  that  will  require  attention  by  specialized  NSGO  staff,  often  on
a daily basis, and with appropriate level of expertise.

The Panel’s Role in the Future

The  Panel  is  currently  revisiting  its  operational  focus  and  mission  in  order  to
evaluate  relevant,  appropriate  and  emerging  challenges,  and  to  determine  how  to
position Sea Grant to meet these challenges. As part of this process, the Panel will
transition  into  an  even  stronger  advisory  role,  bringing  the  significant  knowledge
and prominent expertise of its members to bear on issues critical to Sea Grant’s suc-
cess. We are particularly interested in examining how Sea Grant can use its unique
capabilities  to  further  the  national  interest.  To  answer  this  question,  the  Panel  is
examining  several  issues  of  importance  to  Sea  Grant  as  part  of  its  portfolio.  These
issues  include:  how  to  strengthen  Sea  Grant’s  research  capabilities,  how  to  couple
Sea  Grant’s  outreach  capabilities  with  NOAA’s  climate  applications  programs  and
how to further the use of social sciences to solve coastal problems. Over the coming
year,  as  Sea  Grant  begins  implementation  of  its  national  strategic  plan  and  en-
hances its robust program evaluation system, the Panel will be involved in an advi-
sory  capacity—serving  on  strategic  plan  focus  area  teams,  participating  in  program
site  reviews,  and  offering  high-level  guidance  and  expertise  in  areas  critical  to  Sea
Grant’s mission. Integral to this process, is sufficient ‘‘hands on’’ Panel engagement
to  facilitate  a  well-informed  understanding  of  the  goals,  operations,  issues  and  ac-
complishments of the network programs.

Conclusion

In  closing,  we  believe  that  Sea  Grant  is  vital  to  NOAA’s  mission,  to  U.S.  ocean
science and to our nation’s vision. This is an efficient and effective program, offering
a proven place-based infrastructure, and engaging the academic capacity of our uni-
versities  and  colleges  in  generating  products  and  science-based  solutions  needed  by
our  nation’s  citizenry.  Sea  Grant  engages  our  youth  in  exploration  of  the  marine
sciences,  supports  advanced  academic  training  for  a  cadre  of  future  professionals,
and provides exceptional opportunities for early career leadership development. The
Panel  would  like  to  thank  the  House  for  holding  this  hearing.  We  are  grateful  for
your support of and confidence in the National Sea Grant College Program. We urge
you to consider raising the administrative cap. This concludes my remarks, Madam
Chairwoman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to
be  here  today.  I  would  be  pleased  to  provide  additional  information  and  to  answer
any questions you may have.
