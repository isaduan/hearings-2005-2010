IMPROVING  CONSUMER  PROTECTIONS 

IN  SUBPRIME  LENDING 

TUESDAY,  APRIL  29,  2008 

SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERSTATE COMMERCE, TRADE, AND 
TOURISM, 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:33 a.m. in room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Byron  L.  Dorgan, 
Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding. 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator  DORGAN.  I  call  the  hearing  to  order.  This  is  the  Sub-
committee on Interstate Commerce, Trade, and Tourism of the Sen-
ate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 

The  subject  of  the  hearing  is  improving  consumer  protections  in 

subprime home lending. 

Some weeks ago, in a rather stunning move, the Federal Reserve 
Board  offered  $30  billion  of  guarantees  so  that  J.P.  Morgan  could 
take  over  Bear  Stearns,  which  was  a  very  large  investment  bank 
in  this  country  and  one  that  almost  certainly  would  have  been 
headed  for  bankruptcy  in  a  very  short  period  of  time  had  the  Fed 
not taken action to allow the purchase of Bear Stearns by J.P. Mor-
gan. 

The  circumstances  that  led  to  all  of  this  were  subprime  lending 
and  the  securitization  of  subprime  mortgages.  What  has  happened 
in our country in recent years is an unbelievable amount of specu-
lation and financial engineering. 

That  financial  engineering  meant  that  firms  would  sell  mort-
gages—some  good  mortgages,  some  not  so  good.  They  would  pack-
age  up  the  subprime  mortgages  with  the  good  mortgages,  just  like 
they used to pack sawdust into sausages for filler. And then they’d 
slice  them  and  dice  them,  and  then  they’d  sell  them  two  or  three 
times  after  they  were  securitized,  and  nobody  who  ended  up  with 
them  knew  exactly  what  they  had,  except  they  were  fairly  high- 
yield because most of these subprime mortgages ended up with pre-
payment  penalties.  When  the  interest  rates  were  reset,  the  bor-
rower was going to pay very high interest rates. 

Now,  that’s  just  a  fact  of  what  has  happened.  Most  of  us  would 
have  known  this  was  going  on  because  when  we  brush  our  teeth 
or  shave  in  the  morning  while  getting  ready  for  work,  if  there’s  a 
television  on,  we’ve  all  seen  the  advertisements  that  started  all  of

this:  ‘‘You  have  bad  credit?  You’ve  been  bankrupt?  You  can’t  get  a 
loan? Come to us, we want to give you a loan.’’ We’ve all seen that 
and all wondered, ‘‘How does this add up?’’ 

Well,  the  fact  is,  it  didn’t  add  up,  it  doesn’t  add  up.  And  it  has 
led not only to the collapse of Bear Stearns, a $30 billion guarantee 
by the Federal Reserve Board for some sour paper that exists. I be-
lieve,  a  $200  billion  line  of  credit  for  direct  lending  to  investment 
banks,  the  first  time  since  the  Great  Depression—the  list  goes  on. 
But also you can track a substantial portion of this back to an un-
believable amount of speculation and greed. 

Now,  we’re  going  to  talk  today  about  how  all  of  this  subprime 
lending happened, who was minding the store, who wasn’t minding 
the store, and what should we do going forward. 

But  first,  I  want  to  play  a  couple  of  videos,  and  I  don’t  know  if 
everybody  can  see  the  videos.  These  are  advertisements  for  mort-
gages. 

[Video.] 
Senator  DORGAN.  Those  are  all  advertisements  that  ran  in  this 
country, enticing people to change their mortgage or, when they get 
a  mortgage,  to  get  a  subprime  mortgage  from  one  of  these  compa-
nies.  The  only  thing  I  agree  with  in  that  is,  ‘‘No  one  can  do  it  like 
Countrywide can,’’ and Countrywide couldn’t. 

Let  me  just  mention,  the  first  advertisement  was  Linden  Home 
Loans  advertisement,  and  they  did  run  small  script  at  the  bottom 
of the screen that you couldn’t see and, among other things, it says, 
‘‘The  minimum  payments  do  not  cover  all  of  the  interest  due.  The 
loan  balances  may  increase  or  decrease  based  on  the  payment  op-
tion  chosen  monthly.  The  maximum  negative  amortization  is  115 
percent  of  the  original  loan.  The  no  points  and  no  fee  option  re-
quires  a  3-year  prepayment  penalty.  Rates  are  subject  to  change 
without notice.’’ That’s the thing they didn’t really want the person 
who watched the commercial to understand. 

Predatory  lending?  Seems  to  me  it  is.  Greed?  Seems  to  me  it  is. 
We  read  that  brokers  that  could  put  somebody  in  a  $1  million 
subprime  loan  would  get  a  $30,000  payment  up  front,  as  a  fee— 
there was so much greed here, that it’s unbelievable to me. 

By  the  way,  I  asked  the  presidents  of  all  of  the  companies  of 
which  I  just  showed  the  commercials  if  they  would  join  us  this 
morning.  They  have  decided  they  didn’t  want  to  join  us  at  this 
hearing. 

But, I want to make this point. Let me show some, if I can, some 
charts of things I took off the Internet, just a couple of weeks ago, 
to  show  you  that  nothing  has  changed  very  much.  I  actually  made 
charts of what I found on the Internet. This is a company that was 
advertising on the Internet 3 weeks ago—twenty-five hundredths of 
1  percent  and  a  fixed  loan.  Does  anybody  believe  that?  You  get  a 
fixed  loan  for  one-fourth  of  1  percent?  The  lowest  fixed  rate  loan 
in America—well, I’d think so.

[Laughter.] 
Senator  DORGAN.  One-quarter  of  1  percent.  Yes,  I’d  think  that’d 
be the lowest. I don’t think it’s true, but I think that’d probably be 
the lowest advertised. ‘‘Borrow $200,000 for the payment of $41.66 
a month.’’ All right. 

This  I  found  on  the  Internet:  ‘‘30-year  fixed  rate,  from  two  and 
three-quarters  percent.’’  Does  anybody  believe  you  can  find  a  30- 
year fixed rate for two and three-quarters? I don’t think so. Preda-
tory  lending?  Well,  that’s  Florida  Mortgage  corporation  showing  at 
least deceptive advertising, I would think. Next chart?

Senator  DORGAN.  Five  year,  fixed  payments,  one  and  a  quarter 
percent.  That’s  being  advertised  on  the  Internet  now,  at  least  it 
was  2  weeks  ago  and  suggests  that  you  really  ought  to  be  specu-
lating  in  real  estate:  ‘‘Control  up  to  two  to  three  times  more  real 
estate by using our rates.’’

Senator  DORGAN.  Finally,  First  Premier  Mortgage—I  don’t  know 
who  they  are  or  where  they’re  from—but  they  said,  ‘‘Perfect  credit 
not  required.’’  Want  to  borrow  from  us?  You  don’t  need  perfect 
credit. In fact, ‘‘We give you loans with no income verification.’’

Senator DORGAN. Well, we know, most of us know the terms, ‘‘no 
doc.’’  If  you  decide  you  don’t  want  to  document  your  income  in 
order  to  get  a  home  mortgage,  that’s  kind  of  a  good  thing  because 
then  you  pay  a  little  higher  interest  rate,  so  you  get  your  home 
mortgage without having to tell them all of your information about 
your  financials,  and  the  mortgage  company  actually  makes  a  little 
more  money—at  least  in  the  short-term,  until  it  all  collapses,  of 
course.

Senator  DORGAN.  And  those  are  things  that  you  can  now  go  to 
the  Internet  and  find,  if  you’re  curious  about  who’s  advertising  in 
a deceptive way and who’s trying to lure consumers. 

Now,  there’s  been  this  discussion  about  whether  consumers  are 
the victims? Or, are consumers also greedy? Wanting to get a quar-
ter  of  1  percent  home  loan—would  they  know  better?  The  answer 
is,  yes.  They  should  know  better.  But  let  me  make  this  point—the 
most  complicated  financial  transaction  in  the  life  of  most  people 
will be negotiating a mortgage on their primary residence—it’s the 
largest  asset  anyone  will  have,  in  most  cases,  and  getting  a  home 
mortgage is very complicated.

I  would  like  to  know  if  anybody  in  this  room—and  I  already 
know  the  answer—if  anybody  in  this  room  has  read  through  all  of 
the  papers  that  accompanied  the  mortgage  you  received  on  your 
home.  And  the  answer  is  no,  of  course  not.  You  could  not  possibly 
have  done  it.  So,  we  rely  on  fair  advertising,  accurate  advertising, 
and promotion of products that represents some basic honesty. And 
regrettably, that has not been the case. 

I don’t want to tarnish everybody. There are some good folks out 
there providing home loans today, and owning a home is the Amer-
ican  Dream.  It  used  to  be  a  sleepy  old  industry,  you  went  down  to 
the corner in your town and you sat with the person at the savings 
and  loan  who’d  been  there  for  20  years,  and  they  told  you  exactly 
what  was  going  on,  and  you  got  a  home  loan,  a  mortgage,  and  ev-
erybody was happy. 

That sleepy industry turned into a Roman candle, recently, with 
a  lot  of  powder,  and  a  lot  of  flash.  And  now  we  see  a  lot  of  people 
making  a  lot  of  money,  and  the  whole  tent  collapses  because 
they’ve built a house of cards. 

The last ad was Countrywide. Countrywide was the largest home 
loan  lender  in  this  country.  And  they  were  doing  a  lot  of  things— 
they  were  securitizing,  they  were  doing  everything.  But,  they  had 
brokers  out  there  that  were  selling  products.  Among  other  things, 
they were putting people into subprimes that would have qualified 
for other mortgages—a whole series of things. 

And,  by  the  way,  Countrywide  has  now  been  bought  by  another 
company but the person that constructed Countrywide, and was en-
gaged  in  this,  made  off  with  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.  Hun-
dreds of millions of dollars. 

There’s  a  massive  amount  of  greed,  here,  and  the  reason  I’m 
holding  this  hearing  is  to  try  to  figure  out,  what  we  are  we  doing 
about  this.  First  of  all,  who  is  responsible?  And  second,  why  is  it 
still happening? And third, what are we going to do to stop it? 

Greed  is  pretty  hard  to  stop.  Sometimes  collapse  stops  it,  but 
we’ve  put  now  a  safety  net  under  institutions  that  we’ve  been  told 
are too big to fail but apparently not big enough to regulate. Some-
thing’s  wrong  with  that.  If  you’re  too  big  to  fail,  you’re  not  too 
small  to  regulate.  And  if  the  American  taxpayer  is  going  to  have 
to  put  a  safety  net  under  investment  banks,  and  we’re  now  going 
to  lend  money  directly  to  investment  banks  through  the  Fed,  then 
there  needs  to  be  an  understanding  that  there  should  be  some 
thoughtful regulation. 

I  know  regulation,  for  years,  in  this  town  has  been  a  four-letter 
word,  but  it’s  not  a  four-letter  word  when  you  look  at  predatory 
lending.  The  greed  that’s  happened  in  all  of  these  areas—and  this 
goes  from  the  brokers,  in  some  cases,  to  the  mortgage  lenders,  to 
the  hedge  funds—right  up  and  down  the  line.  Unbelievable  prof-
its—staggering  profits.  Then  guess  what?  Then  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment,  the  poor  old  taxpayer,  and  also  some  folks  that  received 
bad mortgages, end up holding the bag. 

So, obviously that was my short rant at the start of this because 
there  is  something  dreadfully  wrong  here.  At  this  point  nobody  is 
prepared to fix it. And we need to do that. 

We  have  a  hearing  today,  Ms.  Lydia  Parnes  is  with  us.  She  is

Trade  Commission.  We  will  have  a  second  panel  of  the  Attorney 
General  of  the  State  of  Connecticut,  Richard  Blumenthal—we  ap-
preciate  his  attendance—Kathleen  Keest,  Senior  Policy  Counselor 
for  the  Center  for  Responsible  Lending;  Ira  Rheingold,  the  Execu-
tive  Director  of  the  National  Association  of  Consumer  Advocates; 
and Bill Himpler, Executive Vice President of Federal Affairs of the 
American Financial Services Association. 

I  want  to  make  one  final  point  because  I’ve  talked  a  lot  about 
greed  and  deception,  and  so  on.  I  want  to  emphasize  this  point: 
there  are  good,  honest,  decent  people  in  the  industry  we’re  talking 
about,  who  try  to  do  a  good  job.  And  their  reputation,  too,  regret-
tably, is tarnished by those that are trying to make a fast buck and 
those that are greedy. 

But, this morning there is someone buying a house, sitting across 
the desk in a financial institution that they can trust, working with 
a mortgage counselor they can trust, and they’re being able to pur-
chase their American Dream. I don’t want this hearing, and I don’t 
want  other  discussions  to  tarnish  the  goodwill  and  the  honesty  of 
a lot of people who work hard. 

But  I  want  to  point  out  that  the  dramatic  increase  in  subprime 
loans  by  companies  that  have  embedded  in  those  loans  unbeliev-
able terms, penalties, and so on, in order to load up a piece of sau-
sage that they would slice up and securitize with high rates—gave 
everybody the opportunity to behave like hogs in the corn crib. And 
frankly, this has to stop. 

So,  Ms.  Lydia  Parnes,  thank  you  for  being  with  us.  I  want  to 
challenge you a little, as well. I like the Federal Trade Commission, 
but  I  think  it’s  been  absent  on  some  of  these  issues,  so  I’d  like  to 
hear your statement, then I want to ask you some questions. 

You may proceed. 
STATEMENT OF LYDIA B. PARNES, DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF 
CONSUMER PROTECTION, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 
Ms.  PARNES.  Well,  thank  you,  Chairman.  I’m  pleased  to  be  here 
today  to  discuss  the  FTC’s  actions  to  protect  consumers  in  the 
subprime mortgage marketplace. 

As we are all well-aware, the recent crisis of subprime mortgage 
delinquencies  and  foreclosures  is  taking  a  toll  on  American  con-
sumers and their community. 

As  the  nation’s  consumer  protection  agency,  we  understand  at 
the  Commission  that  we  do  have  a  critical  role  to  play  in  the 
subprime mortgage marketplace. 

And Chairman Dorgan, the Commission appreciates your efforts, 
and  the  efforts  of  this  Subcommittee  to  address  consumer  protec-
tion problems in the subprime mortgage area. 

First and foremost, the Commission is a law enforcement agency 
with  wide-ranging  responsibilities,  including  over  consumer  finan-
cial issues. Mortgage lending has long been a Commission priority. 
In  the  past  decade,  the  agency  has  brought  22  actions  focused  on 
the  mortgage  lending  industry,  with  particular  attention  to  the 
subprime market, alleging that lenders and servicers have engaged 
in  unfair  and  deceptive  advertising  and  mortgage  servicing  prac-
tices.  Through  these  cases,  the  FTC  has  returned  more  than  $320 
million to consumers.

Today,  the  Commission  is  announcing  its  most  recent  action  to 
protect  consumers  from  mortgage  foreclosure  rescue  scams.  The 
FTC sued Foreclosure Solutions, alleging that it targets consumers 
facing  foreclosure,  charged  these  consumers  an  up-front  fee  of 
about $1,000, and represented that they would stop the foreclosure. 
In  fact,  according  to  the  FTC’s  complaint,  the  defendants  en-
gaged in minimal efforts on behalf of consumers, and consumers ei-
ther lost their homes, or avoided foreclosure by exercising the same 
options that were available to them, anyway. 

The Commission has filed 3 cases this year against other defend-
ants,  allegedly  engaged  in  mortgage  foreclosure  rescue  fraud,  and 
we  have  more  investigations  underway.  We  also  continue  to  con-
duct outreach and share enforcement resources with state and local 
authorities through 7 regional task forces in cities with particularly 
high foreclosure rates. 

For  consumers,  deceptive  mortgage  advertisements  can  lead  to 
an  ultimately  devastating  experience,  and  so  we  are  aggressively 
examining advertisements that appear in a variety of media. We’re 
investigating the ads of about a dozen companies. Last year, we re-
viewed hundreds of mortgage advertisements and sent warning let-
ters,  as  you  know,  to  200  mortgage  lenders,  because  their  ads  did 
not appear to comply to the laws we enforce. 

We’re  going  back  to  those  advertisers,  and  then  if  they’re  still 

non-compliant, we will follow up with law enforcement. 

Further  FTC  law  enforcement  to  protect  borrowers  will  include 
enforcing  new  Federal  Reserve  Board  mortgage  lending  rules.  The 
Fed  has  proposed  rules  that  prohibit  certain  unfair,  deceptive,  or 
abusive acts and practices in mortgage advertising, origination, ap-
praisal  and  servicing.  It  has  received  public  comment  on  these 
rules, and has announced that it will issue its new rules before the 
end of 2008. 

We  filed  comments  largely  supportive  of  the  proposed  Fed  rules. 
The  Commission  has  the  authority  to  enforce  the  final  rules 
against the non-bank entities under its jurisdiction, and we commit 
to doing so. 

As  noted  in  the  Commission’s  written  testimony,  the  FTC’s  en-
forcement  efforts  would  be  more  effective  if  it  could  obtain  civil 
penalties for violations of these rules. 

In conjunction with our law enforcement, we engage in extensive 
educational  activities  to  empower  consumers  to  better  protect 
themselves.  The  Commission  recently  developed  new  educational 
materials  in  English  and  Spanish,  to  provide  information  to  con-
sumers  about  deceptive  mortgage  ads,  mortgage  foreclosure  rescue 
scams, buying a home, and steps borrowers can take to avoid fore-
closure. 

We  also  understand  that  mortgage  disclosures  are  critical  to 
helping  consumers  making  better  informed  purchasing  decisions. 
Next month, the FTC’s Bureau of Economics will host a conference 
to discuss strategies for ensuring that mortgage disclosures provide 
the greatest benefit to consumers. And the FTC’s conference is, we 
believe,  timely  with  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Devel-
opment considering substantial revisions to its mortgage disclosure 
rules, under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.

We hope that the discussions at the conference will promote com-
prehensive  mortgage  disclosure  reform,  so  that  consumers  receive 
key  information  in  a  manner  that  is  as  clear  and  understandable 
as possible. 

Chairman  thank  you  for  your  attention,  and  I’d  be  happy  to  an-

swer any of your questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LYDIA B. PARNES, DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF CONSUMER 

PROTECTION, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

I. Introduction 

Chairman  Dorgan,  Ranking  Member  DeMint,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I 
am  Lydia  B.  Parnes,  Director  of  the  Bureau  of  Consumer  Protection  at  the  Federal 
Trade Commission (‘‘FTC’’ or ‘‘Commission’’).1 I appreciate the opportunity to appear 
before you today to discuss the Commission’s wide range of activities to protect con-
sumers  in  the  subprime  mortgage  market.  The  Commission  is  concerned  about  the 
rise  in  delinquencies  and  foreclosures  in  the  subprime  market,  and  the  impact  on 
communities,  and  is  committed  to  using  all  of  its  tools  to  protect  consumers  in  this 
market. 

During  today’s  testimony,  the  FTC  would  like  to  emphasize  the  following  points: 
• The  Commission  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  the  fight  against  deceptive 
subprime  lending  and  servicing  practices  since  1998,  when  it  filed  its  case 
against Capital City Mortgage, which allegedly took advantage of African Amer-
ican consumers here in Washington, D.C. 
• In  the  past  decade,  the  FTC  has  brought  22  actions  focused  on  the  mortgage 
lending  industry,  with  particular  attention  to  entities  in  the  subprime  market, 
alleging that mortgage lenders and servicers engaged in unfair or deceptive acts 
and practices. Through these cases, the FTC has returned more than $320 mil-
lion  to  consumers.  Many  of  these  cases  have  challenged  deceptive  advertising 
and marketing practices. 
• The Commission is currently investigating more than a dozen mortgage compa-
nies  as  part  of  a  mortgage  advertising  law  enforcement  sweep.  In  addition  to 
these  investigations,  the  Commission  sent  more  than  200  warning  letters  last 
year  to  mortgage  brokers  and  lenders,  as  well  as  the  media  outlets  that  carry 
their  home  mortgage  advertisements.  FTC  staff  recently  reviewed  the  current 
advertising  of  those  who  received  warning  letters  and  will  follow  up  with  law 
enforcement where appropriate. 
• With  the  recent  rapid  increase  in  mortgage  delinquencies  and  foreclosures,  the 
FTC  also  has  intensified  its  focus  on  protecting  consumers  from  mortgage  fore-
closure  rescue  scams.  The  Commission  has  filed  law  enforcement  actions 
against  defendants  allegedly  engaged  in  mortgage  foreclosure  fraud,  and  has 
additional nonpublic matters under investigation. 
• This month, Commission staff filed a public comment in response to the Federal 
Reserve Board’s proposed rules to restrict certain mortgage practices. The com-
ment  supports  the  Board’s  goals  of  protecting  consumers  in  the  mortgage  mar-
ket  from  unfair,  abusive,  or  deceptive  lending  and  servicing  practices.  If  final-
ized,  the  FTC  will  have  the  authority  to  enforce  these  rules  against  nonbank 
entities under its jurisdiction. The FTC’s enforcement efforts would be more ef-
fective if it could obtain civil penalties for violations of these rules. 
• To  empower  consumers  to  better  protect  themselves  from  potentially  harmful 
conduct, the FTC also engages in extensive consumer education related to mort-
gage  lending.  The  FTC  has  recently  developed  new  educational  materials  in 
English and Spanish to provide information about deceptive mortgage advertise-
ments,  mortgage  foreclosure  rescue  scams,  buying  a  home,  and  the  steps  bor-
rowers can take to avoid foreclosure. 
• The Commission also engages in research and policy development to better un-
derstand and protect consumers in the mortgage marketplace. Next month, FTC 
staff  economists  will  host  a  conference  to  assess  the  role  of  consumer  informa-
tion  in  the  current  mortgage  crisis  and  discuss  strategies  for  ensuring  that 

1 The views expressed in this statement represent the views of the Commission. My oral pres-
entation  and  responses  to  any  questions  are  my  own,  however,  and  do  not  necessarily  reflect 
the views of the Commission or any individual Commissioner.

mortgage  disclosures  will  be  designed  to  provide  the  greatest  benefit  to  con-
sumers. 

This  testimony  will  discuss:  (1)  the  Commission’s  authority  and  mission  related 
to  subprime  lending;  and  (2)  the  FTC’s  efforts  to  protect  mortgage  borrowers,  par-
ticularly  in  the  subprime  market.  As  detailed  below,  the  agency’s  priorities  include 
deceptive  mortgage  advertising,  deceptive  or  unfair  servicing  practices,  discrimina-
tion in lending, and foreclosure rescue scams. 
II. The FTC’s Role in Subprime Lending 

As  the  primary  Federal  agency  that  enforces  consumer  credit  laws  with  respect 
to entities other than banks, thrifts, and Federal credit unions, the Commission has 
wide-ranging  responsibility  regarding  consumer  financial  issues  in  the  mortgage 
market,  including  those  involving  mortgage  lenders,  brokers,  and  servicers.  The 
FTC  enforces  a  number  of  Federal  laws  governing  mortgage  lending,  including  the 
Truth  in  Lending  Act  (‘‘TILA’’),2 the  Home  Ownership  and  Equity  Protection  Act 
(‘‘HOEPA’’),3 and  the  Equal  Credit  Opportunity  Act  (‘‘ECOA’’).4 The  Commission 
also  enforces  Section  5  of  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  Act  (‘‘FTC  Act’’),  which 
more  generally  prohibits  unfair  or  deceptive  acts  or  practices  in  the  marketplace.5 
In  addition,  the  Commission  enforces  a  number  of  other  consumer  protection  stat-
utes  that  govern  financial  service  providers,  including  the  Consumer  Leasing  Act,6 
the  Fair  Debt  Collection  Practices  Act,7 the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act,8 the  Credit 
Repair  Organizations  Act,9 and  the  privacy  provisions  of  the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Act.10 

The  Commission’s  legal  authority  does  not  extend  to  all  entities  that  provide  fi-
nancial  services  to  consumers.  The  FTC  Act  and  the  credit  statutes  that  the  FTC 
enforces  specifically  exempt  banks,  thrifts,  and  Federal  credit  unions,  among  other 
types of entities, from the Commission’s jurisdiction.11 The FTC, however, has juris-
diction  over  nonbank  financial  companies,  including  nonbank  mortgage  companies, 
mortgage brokers, and finance companies. The agency also coordinates regularly on 
financial  practices  matters  with  Federal  banking  agencies,  the  Department  of  Jus-
tice  (‘‘DOJ’’)  and  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (‘‘HUD’’).  In 
addition, the FTC cooperates with state attorneys general and state banking depart-
ments to protect consumers in the mortgage lending arena. 

The  Commission  employs  a  multi-faceted  approach  to  protect  consumers  in  the 
subprime market. The Commission brings enforcement actions against entities that 
violate  the  law,  educates  consumers  and  businesses  as  to  their  rights  and  respon-
sibilities under the law, and engages in research to adapt its policies to protect con-
sumers  more  effectively.  The  testimony  below  discusses  how  the  FTC  is  using  this 
approach to protect consumers in the subprime mortgage marketplace. 
III. Protecting Subprime Mortgage Borrowers 

The  Commission  is  committed  to  using  all  means  at  its  disposal  to  protect  mort-
gage borrowers from those who would prey on their financial turmoil, and to provide 
information to help these consumers confront the challenges they face. 

2 15  U.S.C.  §§ 1601–1666j  (requiring  disclosures  and  establishing  other  requirements  in  con-

nection with consumer credit transactions). 

3 15 U.S.C. § 1639 (providing additional protections for consumers who enter into certain high- 

cost refinance mortgage loans). HOEPA is a part of TILA. 

4 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691–1691f (prohibiting creditor practices that discriminate on the basis of race, 
religion,  national  origin,  sex,  marital  status,  age,  receipt  of  public  assistance,  and  the  exercise 
of certain legal rights). 

5 15 U.S.C. § 45(a). 
6 15 U.S.C. §§ 1667–1667f (requiring disclosures, limiting balloon payments, and regulating ad-

vertising in connection with consumer lease transactions). 

7 15 U.S.C.  §§ 1692–1692p (prohibiting abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices 

by third-party debt collectors). 

8 15  U.S.C.  §§ 1681–1681x  (imposing  standards  for  consumer  reporting  agencies  and  informa-
tion  furnishers  in  connection  with  the  credit  reporting  system  and  placing  restrictions  on  the 
use of credit reporting information). 

9 15 U.S.C. §§ 1679–1679j (prohibiting untrue or misleading representations, requiring certain 
affirmative disclosures, and imposing other restrictions in the offering and sale of ‘‘credit repair’’ 
services). 

10 15 U.S.C. §§ 6801–6809 (imposing requirements on financial institutions with respect to an-
nual privacy notices, procedures for providing customers an opt-out from having certain informa-
tion shared with nonaffiliated third parties, and safeguarding customers’ personally identifiable 
information). 

11 See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(2).

A. Law Enforcement 

13 

The Commission’s law enforcement actions have targeted deception and other ille-
gal practices in the mortgage market, with a particular focus on the subprime mar-
ket. In recent years, the agency has brought 22 actions against companies and prin-
cipals  in  the  mortgage  lending  industry,  including  both  large  and  small  companies 
located throughout the country.12 Several of these cases have resulted in large mon-
etary judgments, collectively returning more than $320 million to consumers. These 
enforcement actions have targeted deceptive or unfair practices in all stages of mort-
gage lending—from advertising and marketing through loan servicing—by mortgage 
lenders, brokers, and loan servicers. 

In  most  of  its  mortgage  lending  cases,  the  Commission  has  challenged  deception 
in  the  advertising  or  marketing  of  subprime  loans.  For  example,  the  FTC’s  com-
plaint against a large subprime mortgage lender, Associates First Capital Corp. and 
Associates Corporation of North America (the ‘‘Associates’’), alleged that the defend-
ants  marketed  subprime  mortgage  loans  through  false  and  misleading  statements 
about  loan  costs.13 Specifically,  the  complaint  alleged  that  the  Associates  rep-
resented that consumers would save money when consolidating their existing debts, 
but  these  ‘‘savings  claims’’  did  not  take  into  account  the  loan  fees  and  closing  costs 
the  company  typically  added  to  consumers’  loan  amounts.  Further,  the  claims  did 
not reveal that, for certain Associates loans, consumers would pay only interest and 
still  would  owe  the  entire  principal  amount  in  a  ‘‘balloon’’  payment  at  the  end  of 
the  loan  term.  The  complaint  also  challenged  as  deceptive  the  Associates’  practice 
of  including  single-premium  credit  insurance  in  loans,  without  disclosing  its  inclu-
sion  to  consumers.  The  defendants  paid  a  record-setting  $215  million  in  consumer 
redress to settle the allegations in the FTC complaint.14 

Mortgage  brokers  also  have  been  the  subject  of  substantial  FTC  law  enforcement 
activity  in  recent  years.  The  FTC  has  brought  enforcement  actions  against  brokers 
for  allegedly  deceiving  consumers  about  key  loan  terms,  such  as  the  existence  of  a 
prepayment  penalty 15 or  a  large  balloon  payment  due  at  the  end  of  the  loan.16 In 
some  of  these  cases,  the  Commission  also  has  charged  brokers  with  falsely  prom-
ising consumers low fixed payments and rates on their mortgage loans.17 For exam-
ple,  in  June  2004,  the  Commission  sued  Chase  Financial  Funding  (‘‘CFF’’),  a  Cali-
fornia  mortgage  broker,  and  its  principals,  in  connection  with  sending  unsolicited 
e-mail and direct mail promising a ‘‘3.5 percent fixed payment loan.’’ 18 The FTC al-
leged that CFF did not offer any such loan and that the loan CFF falsely advertised 
was actually a ‘‘payment option’’ adjustable rate mortgage in which interest accrued 
at a rate higher than advertised, the principal balance would increase if consumers 
made payments at the advertised rates, and the payments were not ‘‘fixed.’’ 

In  2006,  the  Commission  filed  suit  against  a  mortgage  broker  for  allegedly  mis-
representing  numerous  key  loan  terms  to  Hispanic  consumers  who  sought  to  refi-
nance  their  homes.19 As  alleged  in  the  Commission’s  complaint,  the  defendant  con-
ducted  business  with  his  clients  almost  entirely  in  Spanish  but  then  provided  at 
closing  loan  documents  in  English  containing  less  favorable  terms.  As  a  result  of

the  FTC’s  case,  the  lender  has  been  permanently  enjoined  from  misrepresenting 
loan terms. In addition, the court entered a suspended judgment of $240,000 against 
the broker, and the broker paid $10,000 in consumer redress based on a documented 
inability to pay the full judgment amount.20 

Currently,  the  Commission  is  investigating  more  than  a  dozen  mortgage  compa-
nies  as  part  of  a  mortgage  advertising  law  enforcement  sweep.  In  addition,  in  Sep-
tember 2007, the Commission sent warning letters to more than 200 mortgage bro-
kers and lenders, and media outlets that carry their advertisements for home mort-
gages, to advise them that certain of their mortgage ads may be deceptive in viola-
tion of Section 5 of the FTC Act or may violate the TILA.21 The FTC identified the 
ads,  including  some  in  Spanish,  in  June  2007  during  its  nationwide  review  of  ads 
featuring  claims  for  very  low  interest  rates  or  monthly  payment  amounts  without 
adequate  disclosure  of  other  important  loan  terms.  The  Commission  staff  recently 
reviewed the current advertising of those who received warning letters and will fol-
low up with law enforcement where appropriate. 

In addition to law enforcement related to mortgage advertising, the FTC plays an 
important  role  in  preventing  unlawful  mortgage  discrimination.22 Since  the  ECOA 
was  enacted,  the  Commission  has  brought  more  than  three  dozen  cases  against 
large  subprime  lenders,  major  non-mortgage  creditors,  and  smaller  finance  compa-
nies  alleging  ECOA  violations.  About  two  dozen  of  these  cases  have  alleged  sub-
stantive discrimination on the basis of race, marital status, sex, age, and the receipt 
of public assistance. 

The  FTC  closely  coordinates  its  fair  lending  investigations  with  those  of  other 
Federal law enforcement agencies.23 A major component of the Commission’s inves-
tigations is a statistical analysis of the data that companies within the FTC’s juris-
diction  have  produced  pursuant  to  the  Home  Mortgage  Disclosure  Act  (‘‘HMDA’’).24 
At  this  time,  the  Commission  is  conducting  several  non-public  investigations  of 
mortgage originators for possible violations of fair lending laws. 

The  FTC  also  has  challenged  deceptive  and  unfair  practices  in  the  servicing  of 
mortgage  loans.  For  example,  in  November  2003,  the  Commission,  along  with  the 
HUD,  announced  a  settlement  with  Fairbanks  Capital  Corp.  and  its  parent  com-
pany. The Commission alleged that Fairbanks (now called Select Portfolio Servicing, 
Inc.)  failed  to  post  consumers’  payments  upon  receipt,  charged  unauthorized  fees, 
used dishonest or abusive tactics to collect debts, and reported to credit bureaus con-
sumer  payment  information  that  it  knew  to  be  inaccurate.25 The  settlement  agree-
ment included a $40 million redress fund for consumers as well as strong injunctive 
provisions  and  specific  safeguards  to  prevent  the  company  from  foreclosing  on  con-
sumers  without  cause.26 Furthermore,  last  year,  based  on  a  compliance  review  of 
the  company,  the  Commission  negotiated  modifications  of  the  2003  consent  order. 
The modified consent order provides substantial benefits to consumers beyond those 
in  the  original  order,  including  additional  refunds  of  fees  paid  in  certain  cir-
cumstances.27 

The Commission continues to investigate mortgage servicing practices for compli-
ance with the law. Last month, The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. (‘‘Bear Stearns’’) 

20 FTC v. Mortgages Para Hispanos. Com Corp., No. 06–00019 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 25, 2006) (Stip-

ulated Final Judgment and Order of Permanent Injunction). 

21 See  Press  Release,  FTC,  FTC  Warns  Mortgage  Advertisers  and  Media  That  Ads  May  Be 

Deceptive (Sept. 11, 2007), available at www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/09/mortsurf.shtm. 

22 The  Commission’s  July  25,  2007  testimony  before  the  Subcommittee  on  Oversight  and  In-
vestigations of the House Committee on Financial Services detailed the Commission’s fair lend-
ing program. The testimony is available at www.ftc.gov/os/testimony/P064806hdma.pdf. 

23 For  more  than  a  decade,  the  FTC  has  been  a  member  of  the  Interagency  Task  Force  on 
Fair Lending, a joint undertaking with the DOJ, the HUD, and the Federal banking regulatory 
agencies. Task Force members meet often to share information on lending discrimination, preda-
tory lending enforcement, and policy issues. 

24 12  U.S.C.  § 2801.  HMDA  requires  certain  mortgage  lenders  located  in  metropolitan  areas 
to collect and report to the government data about their housing-related loans and applications 
for  such  loans.  The  data  include  pricing  data  for  higher-priced  loans  made  in  2004  or  later.  Of 
the  8,886  institutions  that  reported  HMDA  data  in  2006,  2,004  institutions  are  nondepository 
institutions  subject  to  FTC  jurisdiction.  Robert  B.  Avery,  Kenneth  P.  Brevoort,  and  Glenn  B.

disclosed  that  FTC  staff  has  notified  its  mortgage  servicing  subsidiary,  EMC  Mort-
gage Corporation (‘‘EMC’’), that the staff believes EMC and its parent Bear Stearns 
have  violated  a  number  of  Federal  consumer  protection  statutes  in  connection  with 
its  servicing  activities.  Bear  Stearns  further  disclosed  that  FTC  staff  offered  an  op-
portunity  to  resolve  the  matter  through  consent  negotiations  before  seeking  ap-
proval  from  the  Commission  to  proceed  with  the  filing  of  a  complaint.  According  to 
the disclosure, EMC expects to engage in such discussions with Commission staff.28 
The FTC cannot comment further on this ongoing law enforcement investigation. 

Finally,  with  the  rapid  increase  in  mortgage  delinquencies  and  foreclosures,  the 
FTC  has  intensified  its  efforts  to  protect  consumers  from  mortgage  foreclosure  res-
cue  scams.29 There  are  many  varieties  of  mortgage  foreclosure  rescue  fraud  but,  in 
each  case,  the  perpetrator  makes  misleading  promises  that  a  consumer’s  home  will 
be saved from the pending foreclosure permanently.30 Many consumers, however, ul-
timately lose their homes and lose the money they paid to scammers. 

In  February  of  this  year,  the  Commission  announced  three  cases  targeting  mort-
gage foreclosure rescue scams. These scams, as well as additional conduct currently 
under investigation, share at least two common characteristics. First, the fraudulent 
schemes target consumers who face imminent foreclosure and who thus have limited 
time and resources to save their homes. Second, these schemes falsely promise that 
they can save the consumers’ homes from foreclosure. 

In two of these cases, the Commission alleges that the defendants promise to stop 
foreclosure  in  exchange  for  a  consumer’s  up-front  payment  of  $500  to  $1,200.  After 
a consumer makes the payment, the defendants do little or nothing to stop the fore-
closure.  This  fraud  deprives  consumers  not  only  of  much-needed  funds  but  also  of 
the  opportunity  to  explore  realistic  options  to  avoid  foreclosure.31 In  the  third  case, 
the  Commission  alleges  that  the  defendants  entice  consumers  into  a  second  mort-
gage or home equity line of credit on very unfavorable terms without fully disclosing 
the costs, risks, and consequences of doing so.32 

As  described  above,  the  Commission  has  a  vigorous  law  enforcement  program  to 
protect  consumers  in  connection  with  many  aspects  of  their  mortgage  loans.  The 
FTC  continues  to  explore  ways  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  its  law  enforcement 
activities  related  to  subprime  lending.  For  example,  through  the  Interagency  Pilot 
Project  to  Review  Subprime  Lender  Conduct,  the  FTC,  the  Federal  Reserve  Board 
(‘‘FRB’’), the Office of Thrift Supervision (‘‘OTS’’), and two associations of state regu-
lators  have  combined  forces  to  undertake  an  innovative  law  enforcement  project. 
The agencies are jointly conducting consumer protection compliance reviews and in-
vestigations of certain nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies with signifi-
cant subprime mortgage operations.33 
B. Consumer Education 

Although  law  enforcement  is  the  primary  means  that  the  Commission  uses  to 
combat illegal mortgage lending acts and practices, consumers are, of course, better 
off if they are not injured in the first place. To empower consumers to better protect 
themselves  from  potentially  harmful  conduct,  the  FTC  engages  in  extensive  con-
sumer education related to mortgage lending. 

In  2007,  the  Commission  released  several  new  mortgage-related  consumer  bro-
chures,  including  brochures  on  deceptive  mortgage  advertisements,  buying  a  home, 
how  to  manage  a  mortgage  if  the  mortgage  lender  goes  out  of  business  or  files  for 
bankruptcy, and high-rate, high-fee mortgages.34 To help consumers facing possible

foreclosure,  the  Commission  also  released  an  alert  offering  guidance  on  steps  bor-
rowers can take to avoid foreclosure. In conjunction with its law enforcement actions 
alleging  foreclosure  rescue  schemes,  the  Commission  also  developed  a  stepped-up 
consumer  outreach  initiative  on  foreclosure  rescue  fraud.  Among  other  things,  the 
FTC submitted a series of radio public service announcements, in English and Span-
ish,  to  stations  in  cities  hardest  hit  by  mortgage  foreclosures  and  published  classi-
fied advertisements in English- and Spanish-language community newspapers.35 All 
of  the  Commission’s  consumer  protection  materials,  including  many  released  in 
Spanish  as  part  of  the  Commission’s  Hispanic  Outreach  Program,  are  available  to 
the public on the FTC’s website or by calling the FTC’s Consumer Response Center 
toll-free at 1–877–FTC–HELP.36 

The  Commission  also  regularly  partners  with  other  agencies  to  educate  con-
sumers.  Partnering  with  other  agencies  has  proven  to  be  an  effective  technique  be-
cause  it  taps  the  respective  expertise  and  distribution  channels  of  the  agencies  in-
volved.  The  FTC  has  jointly  published  with  the  banking  regulators,  the  DOJ,  and 
HUD,  brochures  addressing  key  lending  issues.37 The  FTC  continues  to  participate 
in the governmental Financial Literacy and Education Commission, contributing its 
expertise  to  subcommittees  that  produced  MyMoney.gov  and  Taking  Ownership  of 
the Future: The National Strategy for Financial Literacy.38 
C. Research and Policy Development 

The  mortgage  marketplace  in  the  United  States  is  dynamic.  The  Commission 
therefore engages in public workshops and other research efforts so that it may bet-
ter  understand  particular  consumer  protection  issues  in  the  changing  marketplace, 
and  advocate  for  policies  that  promote  protections  for  consumers,  such  as  policies 
that foster informed mortgage borrowing. 

For  example,  in  June  2007,  the  FTC  staff  released  an  empirical  study  assessing 
the effectiveness of mortgage disclosure documents that mortgage originators are re-
quired  to  provide  to  consumers  under  the  Real  Estate  Settlement  Procedures  Act 
(‘‘RESPA’’)  and  TILA.39 The  study  found  that  these  disclosures  were  not  very  effec-
tive  in  helping  consumers  of  subprime  and  prime  mortgages  understand  the  terms 
of  mortgages  and  their  implications.  The  study  also  demonstrated  that  consumers 
could  benefit  from  changes  in  current  disclosure  requirements.  Significantly,  the 
study  suggested  that,  in  actual  market  transactions,  subprime  borrowers  may  face 
even  greater  difficulties  understanding  the  terms  of  their  mortgages  than  they  did 
in  the  study  and,  therefore,  these  borrowers  may  benefit  the  most  from  improved 
disclosures. 

Based  in  part  on  its  mortgage  disclosure  study,  the  FTC  staff  in  November  2007 
submitted  comments  to  the  Federal  banking  agencies  in  response  to  their  request 
for  comments  on  proposed  illustrations  to  disclose  information  to  consumers  about 
subprime  mortgages.40 The  comments  stated  that  consumers  likely  would  benefit 
from one clear disclosure document that alerts them to the major costs and features 
of  a  mortgage.  The  comments  also  noted  that  such  a  document  would  significantly 
reduce the cost of obtaining accurate information about the value of different mort-
gage options, be noticeable and easy to read and understand, feature up-front sum-
maries of key loan features, and make clear what a consumer is getting before sign-

materials  on  mortgage  and  real  estate  issues  are  directly  accessible  from  the  FTC’s  webpage, 
Credit  and  Loans:  Mortgages/Real  Estate,  www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/credit/mort-
gage.shtm.  In  Spanish,  the  materials  are  available  from  the  FTC’s  webpage,  Cre´dito  y 
Pre´stamos:  Hipotecas/Propiedades,  www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/credit/mortgageles. 
shtm. 

35 The Commission also will send information to community libraries, unions, and other orga-

nizations warning consumers about foreclosure rescue scams.

its  webpages,

use  and  safeguarding  personal  information,  and  exhibits  at  Financial  Literacy  Day  on  Capitol 
Hill, where agency representatives distribute free consumer education materials.

ing  legal  documents.  The  comments  further  noted  the  importance  of  consumer  re-
search  and  expressed  the  FTC  staff’s  readiness  to  participate  with  the  FRB  and 
HUD in a more comprehensive effort to improve mortgage disclosures.41 

Next  month,  the  FTC  will  host  a  conference  to  highlight  and  assess  the  role  of 
consumer  information  in  the  current  mortgage  crisis  from  an  economic  perspective. 
Experts  from  several  relevant  specialties  will  gather  to  examine  how  consumer  in-
formation—and  regulation  of  such  information—affects  consumer  choices,  mortgage 
outcomes, and consumer welfare. For example, panelists will discuss the causes and 
effects  of  mortgage  market  product  developments,  the  role  of  consumer  information 
in the mortgage market and how it relates to the current mortgage crisis, and strat-
egies  for  ensuring  that  mandatory  information  disclosures  will  provide  the  greatest 
benefit to consumers. 

Finally, the Commission continues to coordinate and share its expertise with Fed-
eral banking agencies in connection with their proposals to protect consumers in the 
mortgage  marketplace.  This  month,  the  FTC  staff  filed  a  public  comment  with  the 
FRB  in  response  to  its  proposed  rule  to  restrict  certain  mortgage  practices  under 
the  TILA  and  HOEPA.42 In  the  comment,  the  FTC  staff  supported  the  FRB’s  goals 
of: (1) protecting consumers in the mortgage market from unfair, abusive, or decep-
tive  lending  and  servicing  practices  while  preserving  responsible  lending  and  sus-
tainable  home  ownership;  (2)  ensuring  that  advertisements  for  mortgage  loans  are 
accurate  and  not  misleading;  and  (3)  providing  consumers  with  transaction-specific 
disclosures  early  enough  to  use  while  shopping.  The  comment  concludes  that  the 
FRB’s  proposed  restrictions  on  appraisal,  servicing,  and  advertising  practices,  and 
the  revised  timing  requirement  for  TILA  disclosures,  would  be  beneficial  for  con-
sumers.  The  comment  also  notes  that,  while  FRB’s  proposed  restrictions  on  a  new 
category  of  higher-cost  loans  appear  to  strike  a  reasonable  balance,  FTC  staff  en-
courages  the  FRB  to  continue  to  weigh  their  potential  benefits  and  costs,  including 
considering  any  empirical  evidence  submitted  in  response  to  its  proposed  rule-
making  to  confirm  that  this  balance  is  reasonable.  Finally,  the  comment  assesses 
the  Board’s  proposal  regarding  mortgage  broker  compensation  disclosures  and  rec-
ommends an alternative approach.43 

If the FRB’s proposed rules are finalized, the Commission will have the authority 
to  enforce  those  rules  against  nonbank  entities  under  its  jurisdiction.  As  with  its 
current  authority,  the  Commission  intends  to  use  that  new  authority  to  the  fullest 
extent  possible  to  protect  consumers  in  the  subprime  mortgage  market.  The  FTC’s 
enforcement  efforts  would  be  more  effective  if  civil  penalties  were  available  against 
nonbank entities within the FTC’s jurisdiction who violate the rules, a remedy that 
will  be  available  against  entities  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Federal  banking 
agencies.44 

41 Similarly, in a comment filed with the FRB, the Commission stated that, as consumers shop 
for  a  mortgage,  it  is  important  that  they  receive  timely  and  understandable  information  about 
the  loan  terms  and  costs  of  the  particular  products  they  are  trying  to  analyze  and  compare. 
Moreover,  for  many  mortgage  products  with  payment  schedules  that  likely  will  increase  sub-
stantially in future years, it is important that consumers receive information about their future 
payments at a time when they can readily use the information in selecting their preferred loan 
and terms. SEE FEDERAL TRADE COMM’N, COMMENT BEFORE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE

staff filed a public comment with the OTS in response to a request for information about wheth-
er the OTS should issue regulations to expand its prohibitions against thrifts engaging in unfair

IV. Conclusion 

The  Commission  is  committed  to  protecting  subprime  mortgage  borrowers.  The 
FTC’s  law  enforcement,  consumer  education,  and  policy  research  initiatives  in  the 
mortgage  market  are  part  of  the  FTC’s  broad,  vigorous,  and  continuing  program  to 
protect consumers from deceptive, unfair, and otherwise illegal practices. The Com-
mission appreciates the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the FTC’s 
work. 

Senator DORGAN. Thank you very much, Ms. Parnes. 
Let  me  ask  you  your  assessment  of  the  advertisements  that  I 
showed in the clip prior to this hearing. Or at the start of the hear-
ing, I should say. 

Ms.  PARNES.  Chairman,  I’d  prefer  not  to  opine  on  the  specific 

companies. 

Senator DORGAN. Right. 
Ms. PARNES. But I can certainly tell you that the types of claims 
that were depicted in these ads are claims that we would find trou-
bling.  These  are  the  kinds  of  claims  that  we  would  certainly  pur-
sue.  Savings  claims  often  don’t  reveal  all  of  the  hidden  costs  that 
consumers  face,  they’re  false  savings  claims.  As  you’ve  indicated, 
very  low  interest  rates  don’t  disclose  that  the  interest  rate  is  for 
a very short period of time, and the disclosures in fine print would 
not be adequate, as far as we’re concerned at the FTC. 

Senator DORGAN. Ms. Parnes, how many people work at the Bu-
reau  of  Consumer  Protection  at  the  Federal  Trade  Commission? 
How many employees do you have in that Bureau? 

Ms.  PARNES.  We  have  total  employees,  we  have,  I  believe  it  is  a 
little bit under 400, and that includes about 100 people who are in 
our regional offices. 

Senator DORGAN. Has that employment level decreased as it has 
with  the  entire  FTC  over  recent  years,  and  the  last  couple  of  dec-
ades? 

Ms.  PARNES.  I  actually—I  don’t  know  what  the  trend  has  been 
in the Bureau of Consumer Protection, I do know over the past few 
years, resources in BCP have increased. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Now,  you  see  what  I  have  shown,  and  I’ve 
shown some charts, and it’s pretty clear to me that there is at least 
deceptive  advertising  going  on,  and  I’m  trying  to  understand  what 
you all have done to deal with it. 

I know that you’ve brought 22 cases in the last decade, but those 
cases  affect  only  the  case  that  you  bring,  right?  These  are  not 
precedent  cases.  You  bring  a  case  against  22  companies.  I  guess 
I’m  going  to  ask  you  to  answer  the  larger  question—as  this  has 
grown  and  become  a  huge  problem  with  the  giant  bubble  of  greed 
and speculation, why only 22 cases brought by the FTC? 

Ms.  PARNES.  Well,  that’s  a  bit  of  a  hard  question  to  answer.  I 
mean,  I  can  tell  you,  kind  of  two  things.  One  is  that,  for  the  past 
several  months  at  the  Commission  we  have  certainly  been  ques-
tioning ourselves as to whether we could have done more, and what 
we  should  do,  going  forward.  It’s  certainly  been  a  concern  of  ours. 
The  other  point  I  would  make  is  that  while  the  subprime  mort-
gage  crisis  that  we’re  facing  right  now—and  financial  practices, 
generally—is  a  very  significant  priority  for  the  Commission.  Our 

to  obtain  civil  penalties  from  the  nonbank  entities  it  regulates  for  violations  of  TILA  and  its 
implementing regulations.

mission,  itself,  is  incredibly  broad.  We  deal  with  the  entire  range 
of  consumer  protection  issues—deceptive  national  advertising, 
we’re  looking  at  data  breaches,  privacy  issues,  green  marketing,  I 
mean,  those  are  just  a  few  of  the  other  issues  that  we’re  looking 
at. 

Senator  DORGAN.  I  recognize  that  the  jurisdiction  is  broad,  and 
as  I  indicated,  I  very  much  support  the  role  of  the  Federal  Trade 
Commission.  You  must  have  a  referee  in  this  system  of  ours.  And 
I  know,  as  I  said,  regulation  is  given  a  bad  name,  but  regulation 
is  critically  important  to  provide  the  role  of  referee  in  this  market 
system. 

Because,  sometimes  events  just  go  out  of  whack,  and  that’s 
what’s happened here—and I’m trying to understand, as you would 
see, just as I saw, these advertisements saying, ‘‘You’ve been bank-
rupt,  you’ve  got  bad  credit?  Sole  credit?  Don’t  pay?  Come  to  us, 
we’re going to give you some money.’’ And then we started hearing 
about pre-payment penalties, and subprimes, and so on. Was there 
any  effort  at  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  to  say,  ‘‘Look,  some-
thing’s  going  on  here  that  is  creating  a  foundation  of  quicksand 
that could be a very serious problem for the economy,’’ or did it just 
not register? Did you do any rulemaking at all? Or attempt to pro-
ceed to do any rulemaking? 

Ms. PARNES. We did not—we did not do rulemaking. And we did, 
you know, it wasn’t something that we had started. I will tell you, 
and  I—Chairman,  I  know  you  understand—that  at  the  FTC,  the 
rulemaking, the procedures that govern our rulemakings are pretty 
time  and  resource-intensive.  When  we  have  been  directed  by  Con-
gress to engage in a rulemaking, and we’ve given APA rulemaking 
authority,  and  told  a  time  limit  has  been  set  for  that  rulemaking, 
we’ve been able to do those rules in a year, sometimes less. 

Rulemaking  under  the  Magnuson-Moss  rulemaking  procedures, 

at a bare minimum, would take 2 to 3 years. 

Senator DORGAN. I understand that, and I’m trying to fix that for 
you in the FTC reauthorization. But it seems to me no matter how 
long  it  takes,  one  would  start  a  rulemaking  if  they  see  substantial 
abuse. 

I  just  showed  you  charts  of  what’s  on  the  Internet  today—or  at 
least  as  of  2  weeks  ago,  when  I  pulled  it  off.  Do  you  have  people 
down  there,  seeing  those  same  things,  and  taking  a  look  at  those 
companies? 

Ms.  PARNES.  Absolutely.  Looking  at  those  companies  and  others 
that  make  the  same  kinds  of  claims—deceptive  mortgage  adver-
tising  is  an  area  where  we  are  actively  pursuing  enforcement  ef-
forts. 

And  I  would  say  that  we  do  certainly  hope  in  some  areas  that 
our  law  enforcement  effort  has  a  deterrent  impact  on  the  rest  of 
the agency—on the rest of the economy. 

The  ads  that  you  were  showing,  these,  you  know,  and  some  of 
the  other  deceptive  mortgage  advertising  ads  that  we’ve  seen—I’m 
not  sure  that  it  really,  truly  has  a  deterrent  effect  on  outfits  that 
are engaging—really trying to scam consumers.

nesses, when we lay down a marker, we do think that that has an 
effect on their practices, even if we lay that market down in a case. 
Senator  DORGAN.  But,  here  we  have  a  situation.  I  just  got  the 
numbers.  The  FTC,  25  years  ago,  had  1,700  employees,  and  now 
it  has  1,000.  So,  in  25  years,  we’ve  cut  the  agency,  by  40  percent. 
Now  we  see  growing  up  this  set  of  activities  that’s  far  afield  from 
what one would consider to be normal business practices. 

I  go  back  to  the  year  2001  when,  I  believe  it  was  Mr.  Pitt,  who 
was appointed to the Securities and Exchange Commission. I don’t 
have his exact quote, but he essentially said, ‘‘There’s a new Sheriff 
in town, and it’s a much more friendly environment for business at 
the SEC.’’ Well, we understood what that meant. 

What I’m trying to understand is, why did the FTC—as it began 
to  see  what  was  developing  here—why  did  it  pursue  only  22  cases 
over  a  period,  I  think,  of  10  years,  on  deceptive  advertising,  with 
respect to these mortgages? 

Now,  I  will  also  admit  that  these,  I  think,  started  probably  7  or 
8  years  ago,  but  Mr.  Mazzilo  and  all  of  the  others  that,  got  in  the 
trough  here,  creating  this  speculative  binge,  and  making  a  lot  of 
money  while  they  were  doing  it—it  wasn’t  exactly  out  of  sight.  I 
mean,  we  weren’t  necessarily  spending  our  day  thinking  about  it, 
or seeing it, but we have agencies that are supposed to do that. So, 
what failed? 

Let  me  make  one  additional  point—I  understand  that  some  of 
these  were  outside  of  your  purview,  but  the  non-banks—such  as 
Countrywide and others—about half of them were well within your 
jurisdiction. 

Ms.  PARNES.  Well,  I,  you  know,  I  certainly—I  understand  fully 
the  concern  that  you’re  expressing  about  the  actions  that  we  took 
at the FTC—or the non-action. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Or  the  lack  of  them,  I’m  concerned  about  the 

lack of them. 

Ms. PARNES. I understand that—I fully understand that. At that 
time,  even  though  in  the  financial  sector,  those  22  cases  don’t  re-
flect the breadth of the actions that we had taken. 

We  have  a  very,  I  think,  fulsome  record  of  law  enforcement  in 
other  areas  affecting  consumers’  financial  well-being,  as  well.  The 
subprime  crisis  certainly  is  having  a  devastating  impact  on  con-
sumers. And the FTC—we are looking, as you know, at the—at de-
ceptive  mortgage  advertising.  We  have  other,  non-public  investiga-
tions  that  are  ongoing  right  now  in  this  area.  But  there  are  other 
practices  that  affect  consumers’  financial  well-being,  and  we’ve 
been very active in those areas, as well. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Again,  I’m  going  to  call  on  Senator  Nelson 
next, but I want to say that because I can go to the Internet right 
now  and  get  the  same  kind  of  deceptive  advertising  that  is  at-
tempting  to  lure  people  into  bad  mortgages.  It  seems  to  me  the 
FTC should be apoplectic about that, and holding press conferences 
and  saying,  ‘‘Don’t  even  think  about  this.  Don’t  even  dare  move  in 
this  direction,  given  what  we’ve  found  with  this  spectacular  col-
lapse as a result of what has happened in the subprime area.’’ 

So, I’ll come back with another question, but let me call on Sen-

ator Nelson.

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Senator NELSON. Mr. Chairman, to your point, the Federal Trade 
Commission has the regulatory authority over these kind of lending 
practices  through  the  enforcement  of  existing  laws.  As  a  matter  of 
fact, the agency retains jurisdiction over non-bank financial compa-
nies such as the mortgage brokers, and non-bank mortgage compa-
nies,  and  get  this:  in  2007,  19  of  20  subprime  mortgage  lenders  in 
the U.S. fell under the FTC’s jurisdiction. 

So, the question is begged—why haven’t we done this? And what 
are  we  going  to  do  about  it,  in  the  future?  And  I  just  kind  of  lay 
the predicate, or set the table here for you. 

My  state  is  very  much  affected.  The  foreclosures  are  sky-
rocketing—you  know  what  the  real  estate  market  is  like.  We  had 
the second highest total of foreclosures nationwide, and four of the 
top  twenty  metro  areas  in  the  country  were  in  Florida.  Fort  Lau-
derdale was 8th, Orlando was 13th, Miami was 14th and Sarasota/ 
Bradenton was 15th. 

Of  course,  many  of  those  in  Florida  that  are  facing  the  fore-
closure,  were  the  victims  of  the  abusive  and  predatory  lending 
practices.  And  the  interesting  thing  is  that  some  of  these  victims 
actually  qualified  for  a  better  prime  loan  instead  of  a  subprime 
loan,  and  a  December  Wall  Street  Journal  article  found  that  61 
percent  of  subprime  borrowers,  if  reviewed,  had  actually  high 
enough credit scores to qualify for the prime loans. 

And so, this game was going on where lenders and brokers gave 
these  borrowers  mortgages  with  exploding  interest  rate  payments 
that  they  knew  that  the  borrower  could  not  afford,  and  then  they 
packaged these mortgages in deceptive and confusing ways. 

And that’s what the FTC has jurisdiction over. And so, what are 
we  going  to  do  about  this?  Now  that  we  didn’t  do  anything  about 
it, what are we going to do about it on a going-forward basis? 

Ms.  PARNES.  Well,  Senator,  on  a  going-forward  basis,  one  of  the 
things that we are very concerned about—we think that consumers 
that are—who are facing foreclosure are particularly susceptible to 
mortgage  foreclosure  scams.  And  we  are  participating  in  regional 
task  forces  throughout  the  country  with  state  attorneys  general 
and other local law enforcers to pool our resources and take action 
against  these  entities  that  are  engaging  in  this  type  of  fraud,  and 
kind of, essentially, adding insult to injury to consumers who have 
already  been  seriously  injured.  So,  that’s  the  first  thing  that  we’re 
doing. 

As  you  know,  the  Federal  Reserve  Board  has  proposed  a  rule 
that  would  govern  the  subprime  mortgage  market,  and  it  covers 
the  entire  marketplace.  So,  it  would  cover  those  entities  that  fall 
within the Commission’s jurisdiction. We understand that rule will 
be effective this year, and we will enforce that rule. 

Senator  NELSON.  Now,  is  that  how  we’re  going  to  draw  a  clear 
line  between  a  valid  subprime  lending,  and  the  predatory  lending? 
Ms.  PARNES.  Well,  I’m  not  certain  that  for  purposes  of  FTC  en-
forcement—I  understand  the  terminology,  subprime  and  predatory 
lending, but we don’t—we’re not necessarily concerned with making 
that  distinction.  We  really  look  to  our  statute.  And  if  there  is  de-
ception or unfairness, we will—we can and will—pursue that actor.

Senator NELSON. Didn’t you all go after the practices like bad ad-
vertising,  and  that  sort  of  activity?  Is  that  really  going  to  address 
the  problem?  Isn’t  it  going  to  be  that  we’ve  got  to  dig  in  deeper  as 
to  what  these  people  are  doing  when  they  cross  the  line  between 
a valid subprime loan and the predatory lending? 

Ms.  PARNES.  I  actually—I  think  it’s  both.  I  think  the  deceptive 
advertising  kind  of  lures  the  consumer  in,  and  as  we  know,  mort-
gages are extremely complicated transactions for consumers. And if 
they’re  being,  kind  of,  pulled  in  through  lies,  that’s  certainly  a 
problem, and that’s something that we would want to go after. 

But  the  other  practices  that  you’re  talking  about,  the  other  un-
fair practices are also problems. And we have pursued them in our 
cases, we will certainly will continue to do that in the future. 

Senator NELSON. The Chairman said that your employment level 
of full-time employees at the FTC had dropped from 1,700 down to 
1,000. Do you need more people to help you? 

Ms.  PARNES.  Well,  we  certainly—I  will  tell  you  that  in  the  Bu-
reau  of  Consumer  Protection  we  are—we  are  shifting  resources, 
and  we  have  been  doing  so  for  the  past,  oh,  maybe  18  months. 
We’re  shifting  resources  into  financial  practices,  we  are  growing— 
we are growing that division. And that’s the area that we’ve asked 
for additional resources. 

So,  we  appreciate  this  Subcommittee  and  Committee’s  support 

for the agency in that respect. 

Senator  NELSON.  How  many  additional  people  have  you  asked 

Ms. PARNES. Senator, I don’t recall, I would need to go back and 

for? 

look at the documents. 

Senator NELSON. Mr. Chairman, I think to follow up on your line 

of questioning, we would need that information. 

Senator DORGAN. Senator Nelson—— 
Senator NELSON. Thank you. 
Senator  DORGAN.  Ms.  Parnes  can’t  answer  your  question,  frank-
ly,  because  Mike  Parker,  a  former  Congressman,  went  to  work  for 
this  Administration  and  was  with  the  Division  of  Civil  Works  of 
the Corps of Engineers. He came to a Congressional committee and 
answered the question honestly, ‘‘Yes, we need more resources. We 
don’t  have  the  resources  to  do  this,’’  and  the  next  morning  he  was 
fired. 

Ms.  Parnes  has  a  responsibility,  I  suppose,  to  support  the  Presi-
dent’s  budget  request,  or  she  may  not  have  a  job  tomorrow  morn-
ing. 

So, her answer, I think, was that they’re shifting people around. 
But,  the  fact  remains,  in  this  time  of  pretty  substantial  difficulty, 
we have a good agency but one with 1,000 people, when it had sub-
stantially  more  people,  700  more  people  25  years  ago,  and  that’s  a 
serious problem. 

And I want to make one additional point before I call on Senator 
McCaskill. The point, I think, Senator Nelson was making, was not 
just deceptive advertising, which I was dwelling on earlier, but the 
issue  of  the  mortgage  company  and  the  broker  that  would  put  a 
borrower  in  a  subprime  mortgage  when,  in  fact,  they  qualified  for 
a  regular  mortgage.  Putting  him  in  a  subprime  with  pre-payment 
penalties and so on—that’s what made all of this very lucrative.

It’s  what  made  the  hedge  funds,  and  others,  that  began  to 
securitize them—the fact that they had pre-payment penalties em-
bedded in the mortgage—very attractive for everybody. 

Those  were  practices,  not  advertising,  practices—in  my  judg-

ment—that run far afield of what should be acceptable. 

And one final point—the Federal Reserve Board rules are out for 
comment  at  this  point—I  mean,  I  might  say,  the  Federal  Reserve 
Board  has  been  vacant  for  a  long,  on  vacation  on  these  issues,  for 
a  long  period  of  time,  and  bear  substantial  responsibility,  as  well. 
But their so-called rules are OK, but they don’t do anything with 
respect  to  pre-payment  penalties,  which  is  a  significant  problem, 
but—— 

Senator  NELSON.  Which  agency,  Mr.  Chairman,  should  be  look-
ing after that circumstance that you just described. Where they de-
ceptively  shove  somebody  into  a  subprime  loan,  instead  of  where 
they would qualify for a prime loan? 

Senator DORGAN. —there’s deception and unfair practices. FTC is 

involved in both and would have responsibility for both. 

Senator McCaskill? 
Senator NELSON. Well said. 

STATEMENT OF HON. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI 
Senator MCCASKILL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  think  you  hear  the  frustration.  I’m  a  former  prosecutor.  If  we 
had  a  crime  outbreak  in  a  certain  area  of  Kansas  City  that  in-
volved  armed  robbery  of  convenience  stores,  we  would  have  a  cop 
on  the  beat,  we  would  know  who  the  cop  on  the  beat  was,  and  we 
would know how to address that problem. 

So  far,  there  seems  to  be  a  lack  of  anyone  stepping  up  and  say-
ing,  ‘‘I’m  the  cop  on  the  beat.’’  And  we  want  you,  Ms.  Parnes,  to 
be  one  of  the  cops  on  the  beat.  And  it  doesn’t  appear,  so  far,  that 
people  are  taking  responsibility  for  not  being  the  cop  on  the  beat, 
or really saying, ‘‘I want to be that cop.’’ 

And  let  me  talk  specifically  now  about  the  aftermath.  As  we 
would say in Missouri, the cow is out of the barn, and we now have 
to  try  to  clean  it  up,  we  now  have  to  prevent  these  problems  from 
occurring  going  forward,  and  one  of  the  things  that’s  happening  is 
that the same people that were vulnerable to these subprime loans, 
are  now  vulnerable  to  the  scams  that  are  coming  after  the 
subprime loan debacle. 

There’s  a  company  called  Mortgage  Shield  out  of  Houston, 
Texas—are  you  familiar  with  this  company,  Ms.  Barnes?  Parnes, 
excuse me. Does that sound familiar at all? 

Ms. PARNES. Well—— 
Senator  MCCASKILL.  I  know  you  said  earlier  in  your  testimony, 
you didn’t want to talk about specific companies, but let me tell you 
what Mortgage Shield is doing. 

They  call  people  in  stress  situations  whose  names  they  are  get-
ting,  saying  they  are  a  loan  modification  program—that  they  can 
help  people  with  a  loan  modification.  Then  if  you  want  to  hear 
more,  you  press  2—and  then  someone  comes  on  the  line  and  has 
speaking  points.  And  they  give  the  impression  that  they  can  help 
you  at  your  time  of  crisis—these  vulnerable  people.  All  you  have

24 

to  do  is  send  them  $19.95  for  the  subscription.  And  if  you  pay 
$19.95 for the monthly subscription, they can help you through this 
mess. 

That is just one example, and I’m sure there are dozens and doz-
ens  out  there,  of  the  vultures  preying  upon  these  people  in  their 
time of crisis, trying to make a quick buck. 

Now is the time for all of those cops that you have—not enough, 
obviously,  and  you  can’t  say  you  need  more,  or  the  President  will 
get  mad—but  all  that  you  have  to  step  up  and  say,  ‘‘We  are,  at 
least,  going  to  be  really  aggressive,  and  high-profile,’’  because  you 
have  the  deterrent  ability.  You  know,  there  is  deterrence  that  is 
possible  here.  And  you  know  it  because  you  guys  have  done  it  in 
other  areas  before,  when  the  FTC’s  authority  has  been  exercised. 
And  I  just  hope  you  all  are  as  exercised.  Are  you  aware  of  any 
investigations  you  have  ongoing  concerning  these  companies  that 
are now preying upon these vulnerable people? 

Ms.  PARNES.  These  are  exactly  the  types  of  investigations  that 
we  have  ongoing.  There  are—the  types,  the  companies  that  are 
preying  on  consumers  who  are  particularly  vulnerable  right  now, 
because their homes—because they’re in foreclosure. 

We  have  a  case  that  we  brought  yesterday  where  consumers 
whose  names  were  list—consumers  were  targeted,  we  allege,  by 
this  company  because  their  names  were  included  in  public 
records—— 

Senator MCCASKILL. Right. 
Ms. PARNES.—as, as being—as being—— 
Senator MCCASKILL. Defaulting. 
Ms.  PARNES.  —exactly.  Defaulting  on  their  loans,  and  these  con-
sumers  received  solicitations  from  the  company  that  we  sued, 
charging  them—not  $19.95—but  $1,000.00.  And  promising  that 
they  would  take  then  out  of  foreclosure,  and  not  delivering.  And 
we’ve sued that company—several others—we have many more in-
vestigations  underway,  and  our  cops  on  the  beat  are  participating 
in regional task forces throughout the country, so that we can work 
with  our  colleagues  in  state  and  local  governments,  and  really 
share  resources,  and  leverage  our  resources,  and  be  most  effective 
that way. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  I  certainly  would  recommend—I  know  that 
you’re  having  task  forces,  but  the  people  who  are  losing  their 
homes  aren’t  going  to  those  task  forces.  I  would  certainly  rec-
ommend  that  you  forward  information  to  all  of  our  offices.  We  get 
heartbreaking phone calls, every day. Somebody tells the people at 
the end of their rope, ‘‘Well, call your Congressman, call your Sen-
ator.’’ And we are fielding calls on a daily basis that make me sick. 
These people are trying so hard. 

I  would  love  it  if  you  guys  would  begin  communicating  directly 
with  our  offices,  so  we  can  send  out  e-mails  to  those  who  have  e- 
mail and so we can send letters to people who have called us with 
information  about  some  of  the  scams  that  you  all  are  looking  at, 
as  it  relates  to  these  people  that  are  vulnerable,  who  are  looking 
for  any  kind  of  lifeline,  and  mistakenly  are  giving  people  money, 
thinking they’re getting a lifeline, and they’re getting nothing. 

Ms. PARNES. Senator, we would be happy to do that. We actually 
have—we  have  some  pages  on  our  website  that  are  specifically

geared toward these types of consumer—financial issues. We would 
be happy to work with your staff, and make sure that your website 
links  to  our  website,  so  your  constituents  can  get  that  information 
directly. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  If  I  might,  Mr.  Chairman,  one  more  ques-

Senator DORGAN. Yes. 
Senator  MCCASKILL.  Thank  you.  There’s  another  area  that  has 
the same danger signals that subprime had. And if you take a heli-
copter-view  of  subprime,  it  was  pretty  simple.  The  people  who 
made money on closing the loans had no risk. And when you don’t 
have  risk,  then  you  don’t  care  whether  people  can  pay  them  back, 
you don’t care if it’s unfair, you’re not going to have an ongoing re-
lationship  with  this  person.  It’s  not  like  a  small  community  bank. 
These are people who knew that if they closed the loan, they made 
the money, and they were done. They washed their hands of it. 

The same situation is true in reverse mortgages. The people who 
are closing reverse mortgages have no risk. Now, what’s really kind 
of  scary  about  reverse  mortgages  is  that  taxpayers  have  the  risk. 
And now these things are being marketed as a government benefit 
you can’t miss. They are being widely marketed—and as you know, 
Congress wants to take the lid off of reverse mortgages because we 
make money in our budget to spend. 

In  the  closing  cost  of  a  reverse  mortgage,  there’s  a  fee  that  goes 
to  the  Federal  Government,  so  the  appropriators—all  due  respect, 
because  I  know  you’re  an  appropriator,  Mr.  Chairman—we  want 
more  money  in  the  budget,  and  we  get  money  off  the  closing  of 
those  reverse  mortgages,  but  the  tale  of  them  is  a  long  tale.  It  is 
expensive for seniors, and frankly, a mortgage is not nearly as com-
plicated as a reverse mortgage. 

I  would  like  to  know,  specifically,  from  you,  what  the  FTC  is 
doing, on an ongoing basis, to look at these reverse mortgage firms 
and  to  look  at  these  marketing  techniques.  I  mean,  we  saw  in  a 
hearing  that  companies  were  marketing  annuities  in  tandem  with 
a reverse mortgage to 80-year-old people. I mean, no shame. Abso-
lutely no shame. 

I am anxious. We’ve taken some legislative steps to try to correct 
some  of  these  things,  but  I’m  anxious  to  get  specifics  from  your 
agency  as  to  what  you’re  doing  because  this  is  the  next  problem 
that could occur if we don’t get on it now. Shame on us if we don’t 
fix it now, rather than waiting until we’ve got the kind of problem 
that we’ve got with subprimes. 

Ms.  PARNES.  Right.  And  I  think  certainly  with  the  changing  de-
mographics  in  our  country,  it’s  the  beginning  of  the  issue,  and 
you’re absolutely right. It’s an area that we are getting on, and we 
would be happy to do further briefings for you, as we move ahead. 
Senator  MCCASKILL.  OK.  And  we’ll  try  to  get  you  more  people 

next year. 

Ms. PARNES. Thank you. 
Senator MCCASKILL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator DORGAN. Senator McCaskill, thank you very much. 
At the risk of injuring your career, I assume that you need more 
people,  and  I  assume  you  need  the  resources  to  deal  with  this 
issue, is that not correct?

Ms. PARNES. Yes, it is correct. 
Senator DORGAN. And—— 
Ms.  PARNES.  And  I  hope  I’ll  be  here  tomorrow—well,  maybe  not 

here tomorrow, but—— 

[Laughter.] 
Ms. PARNES.—I hope I’ll be back at work tomorrow. 
Senator DORGAN. Well, I didn’t ask the question to get rid of you, 

but I appreciate your candor. 

Let  me  also  ask  you  about  what  I  see  as  the  lack  of  roar—the 
lack of a national voice coming from the Federal Trade Commission 
on an issue of its jurisdiction. 

Why, given what we now know of these dramatic impacts on the 
economy  of  what  has  happened,  the  continued  advertising  still 
going  on—why  is  the  FTC  not  holding  press  conferences,  not  mak-
ing  a  big  fuss  about  this,  not  going  to  the  National  Press  Club? 
Maybe  you  are,  and  maybe  they’re  not  covering  it—I  don’t  know. 
At  least,  I  hear  none  of  it.  I  would  think  you’d  be  apoplectic 
about it. This is right in your wheelhouse. Your agency is an agen-
cy we fund because we want you up at the plate, taking the swing, 
and getting rid of this bad behavior. So, tell me why that’s not hap-
pening? Why I don’t see it? 

Ms.  PARNES.  Well,  Senator,  if  you  think  that  we’re  not  making 
enough  noise—we’re  not.  And  we  need  to  go  back  and  take  a  look 
at  that.  You  know,  we’re  doing—we  are  bringing  cases,  we  are, 
we’re investigating but, we obviously need to take it up a notch, or 
two. 

Senator DORGAN. The point I was trying to make is that bringing 
cases  is  something  you  should  do—but  only  22  cases  in  a  decade. 
There  are  hundreds,  and  hundreds,  and  hundreds  of  cases  out 
there,  I  assume.  You  can’t  track  them  down  one-by-one.  I’m  going 
to  try  to  give  you  some  additional  authority  in  the  Federal  Trade 
Commission reauthorization bill, but, in the interim, you still have 
some  capability  under  Section  5  to  take  action.  And  I  really  hope 
that this agency will begin to take much, much more aggressive ac-
tion. 

Ms.  PARNES.  Well,  I  think  we  should  certainly  consider  whether 
even—you know, absent APA authority whether we should be con-
sidering  a  rule  to  supplement  whatever  the  Fed  ultimately  issues 
in this area. And I also think we need to consider additional strate-
gies. 

Senator  DORGAN.  I  mean,  I  don’t  lay  awake  at  night  placing 
great hope in the Fed. I mean, the Fed is part of the problem here, 
not part of the solution, regrettably. And had they not been asleep 
for  some  of  these  years,  and  very  interested  in  ignoring  what  was 
happening,  we  wouldn’t  be  in  this  situation.  I  must  say,  some  of 
the same holds true, I think, for some lack of aggressiveness on the 
part of the Federal Trade Commission. 

Let  me  just  ask  a  question  more  specifically—in  September  of 
last year, you issued warning letters to lenders regarding their ad-
vertising,  and  the  FTC  is  investigating,  as  I  understand  it,  more 
than  a  dozen  mortgage  companies  as  part  of  a  mortgage  adver-
tising law enforcement sweep. What’s the status of that, and what’s 
the status of the further investigations into advertisements used by 
non-bank lenders at this point?

Ms. PARNES. Mr. Chairman, those—the status of those investiga-
tions are non-public, and so we would have to provide a non-public 
briefing for you, and we would be happy to do that. 

Senator DORGAN. All right, I appreciate that. 
Well, thank you for being with us. This Committee wants you to 
succeed.  We  want  the  agency  to  succeed.  We  don’t  want  there  to 
be inaction, we want there to be a lot of action on behalf of a regu-
latory agency that has the tools and the capability to address these 
issues. 

Ms.  Parnes,  thank  you  very  much  for  being  with  us  today.  We 

appreciate your testimony. 

support of the agency. 

Ms. PARNES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your 

Senator DORGAN. Thank you. 
Next, we will call the second panel to the dais. 
Mr.  Richard  Blumenthal,  the  Attorney  General  of  the  State  of 
Connecticut, Kathleen Keest, Senior Policy Counsel, Center for Re-
sponsible Lending—Ms. Parnes, are you able to stay to listen to the 
testimony? Or do you have to leave? Are you able to listen to a por-
tion of it? 

Ms. PARNES. I can stay for a—for a portion—— 
Senator DORGAN. If you would. 
Ms. PARNES.—of their testimony.

with  the  Honorable  Richard  Blumenthal,  Attorney  General  of  the 
State of Connecticut. 

Mr.  Blumenthal,  thank  you  very  much.  I  believe  you  have  ap-

peared before this Committee previously. 

STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, 
ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF CONNECTICUT 

Mr.  BLUMENTHAL.  I  have,  Senator,  and  I  want  to  thank  you  for 
having  me  again  today  on  a  subject  of  supreme  importance,  for 
Connecticut  citizens,  for  homeowners  around  the  country,  and  for 
all of us in both state and Federal Government. 

I  think  a  number  of  the  observations  made  already  by  yourself 
and  other  Senators  are  extraordinarily  pertinent,  but  I  would  just 
respectfully  suggest  that  the  legislation  you’ve  submitted  can  lead 
us  to  a  new  paradigm,  a  new  partnership,  between  state  and  Fed-
eral authorities. 

The Federal agencies have been AWOL. Federal enforcement has 
been  lax  and  lackadaisical.  But  even  more  insidiously,  the  Federal 
Government  has  increasingly  preempted  and  blocked  the  states 
from  enforcing  their  laws  to  protect  consumers  against  exactly  the 
kind of predatory and abusive practices that were displayed before 
us today, and are on display—still, day in and day out. 

And  my  office  has  prosecuted  such  cases,  we  have  cases  ongoing 
right now involving major predatory loan schemes in New London, 
and  elsewhere  in  our  own  state.  And  the  states  were  involved  in

28 

enforcing laws against these kinds of no doc loans, inflated apprais-
als,  other  kinds  of  abuses,  before  the  subprime  debacle  became  a 
public spectacle. 

In  fact,  the  two  major  cases  done  by  our  multi-state  task  forces 
produced  close  to  a  billion  dollars—Household  Finance  and 
Ameriquest—two  cases  that  produced  close  to  a  billion  dollars,  as 
compared to the 22 cases done by the FTC, with about $320 million 
in restitution for consumers. 

So,  the  States  are  very  much  a  law  enforcement  presence,  they 
have been, they should continue to be so, and unfortunately, States 
have  been  shackled  and  subverted  by  this  doctrine  and  increasing 
approach  of  Federal  preemption,  which  is  really  an  arrogant  as-
sumption  of  exclusive  power  that  all  too  commonly  replaces  State 
enforcement with Federal inaction. 

It isn’t only that the Federal Government is inert. It says to the 
States, ‘‘We know better, and only we can do it, but we choose not 
to do it,’’ when it comes to consumer protection. And that has been 
the  pernicious  approach  of  many  Federal  agencies—most  promi-
nently,  the  Office  of  the  Comptroller  of  the  Currency,  which  cul-
minated  in  a  decision  by  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  under  the  Na-
tional  Bank  Act  in  April  2007,  Waters  v.  Wachovia,  which  held,  in 
effect, that the National Bank Act precludes States from operating 
subsidiaries  of  national  banks—those  federally  chartered  banks, 
even  operating  as  lenders  in  our  States,  through  their  operating 
subsidiaries,  are  beyond  our  regulation,  and  consumer  protection 
activities. 

Your  bill,  Mr.  Chairman,  would  break  that  trend.  And  set  a  dif-
ferent  course  toward  this  new  paradigm  of  partnership,  enabling 
States  to  be  active  allies  of  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  and  of 
other Federal agencies in this very, very important activity. 

We  have  suggested,  my  office,  has  urged  our  legislature  to  ban 
those  pre-payment  penalties.  Not  just  in  the  subprime  areas,  but 
for  all  loans.  Because  they  really  imprison  homeowners  in  loans 
that may be unaffordable, and actually promote foreclosure and de-
fault. 

We  have  urged  stronger  action  against  the  mortgage  rescue 
scams that are now increasingly prevalent, in the wake of the fore-
closure  increase  in  numbers.  We  see,  increasingly,  a  follow  up 
scam, through mortgage rescue promises and claims. 

Resources are tremendously important, for both the FTC and the 
States, and as a prosecutor, as a Federal prosecutor, former United 
States  Attorney  for  Connecticut,  as  well  as  State  law  enforcement 
officer, resources are always on my mind, because they are the life-
blood of any successful prosecutorial office. 

The  Federal  role  ought  to  be  reconstituted  and  reconfigured,  so 
as  to  enable  States  to  play  this  kind  of  role,  and  the  combination 
of State and Federal Government can be very, very profoundly im-
portant as a deterrent, as well as a source of restitution. 

I think you made this point earlier, that publicity, and public no-
tice form a deterrent purpose. And that is very important, as we’ve 
seen in our prosecutorial activities. 

The  kinds  of  abuses  that  we  see—one-stop  shopping  for  preda-
tory  lending  schemes,  inflated  appraisals,  fabricated  loans,  the  no 
doc loans, the Alt-A loans—typically target first-time homebuyers—

many  of  them  non-English-speaking  people,  but  really  across  the 
board.  And  very  often  involve  bait-and-switch  tactics  at  closings 
that are inherently deceptive, and misleading. 

Let  me  just  close  by  saying  that,  I  hope  that  this  hearing  will 
lead  to  additional  momentum  toward  these  goals.  We  have  an  op-
portunity—it  really  is  an  obligation—to  unite  Federal  and  State 
governments,  to  end  the  trend  toward  Federal  preemption,  to  em-
power  States  in  protecting  their  citizens  against  these  abusive 
practices,  and  in  forming  the  kind  of  combination  that  I  think  is 
important. 

Because, it is an enduring truth that, when we work together, we 

do well in protecting people. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Blumenthal follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, ATTORNEY GENERAL, 

STATE OF CONNECTICUT 

I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the timely topic of ‘‘Improving Consumer 

Protections in Subprime Lending.’’ 

The  steadily  worsening  housing  crisis  threatens  millions  of  families  from  rural, 
urban and suburban neighborhoods, undermining communities across the Nation. In 
Connecticut  alone,  there  were  more  than  3,500  foreclosure  actions  in  just  1  month, 
putting our state in the top ten. 

The  ongoing,  deepening  crisis  creates  an  opportunity—indeed  an  obligation—for 
a  new,  aggressive,  innovative  effort  to  fight  fraud  and  protect  consumers.  The  bill 
before you exemplifies the more vigorous and vigilant spirit that is necessary—unit-
ing Federal and state governments against abusive anti-consumer practices. 

There must be a new Federal/state consumer protection partnership—really a re-
newed  and  reinvigorated  alliance  and  enforcement  paradigm.  States  have  been 
shackled  and  subverted  by  Federal  preemption—an  arrogant  assumption  of  exclu-
sive  power  that  all  too  commonly  replaces  state  enforcement  with  Federal  inaction. 
A  new  partnership  would  allow  states  to  enact  consumer  protection  measures  con-
currently  and  cooperatively  with  Federal  authorities,  provide  Federal  regulation 
based on the best state safeguards, and establish Federal/state collaborative enforce-
ment of these consumer protections. 

This paradigm has sound precedent. A model would be antitrust enforcement with 
separate  but  parallel  Federal  and  state  laws  and  joint  enforcement.  Others  involve 
Medicaid fraud and deceptive product advertising. 

For  too  long,  we  have  been  at  odds.  Federal  and  state  enforcers  and  regulators 
have been in conflict, rather than collaboration. Our message to an inert, inattentive 
Federal Government has been: join us, or get out of the way. An enduring historical 
truth is how well we do when we work together. 

The  Federal  role  should  be  reconstituted  and  reconfigured.  States  should  be  en-
abled and encouraged to do what they do best: efficiently and effectively protect con-
sumers from constantly evolving financial schemes. The Federal Government should 
review these laws, enacting into Federal regulation the best state consumer protec-
tions,  applying  them  across  the  country  as  Federal  law.  A  formal  joint  Federal  and 
state strike force on financial services consumerism would combine the strengths of 
both—the resources and national scope of the Federal Government with the nimble 
responsiveness  of  state  government—to  help  consumers  combat  fraudulent  and  de-
ceptive industry practices. 

As states like Connecticut are now doing, the Federal Government should specifi-
cally ban prepayment penalties, prohibit inflated appraisals, require clear disclosure 
of  key  mortgage  terms  including  estimates  of  taxes  and  insurance  and  reasonable 
projections  of  future  monthly  payments  for  adjustable  rate  loans.  It  should  compel 
mortgage  companies  to  demonstrate  that  borrowers  can  afford  their  loans,  and  re-
quire  disclosure  of  concealed  fees  or  charges.  It  should  ban  advertising  and  pro-
motions that are deceptive or misleading. 

Lax and lackadaisical Federal enforcement must end. States should be empowered 

as full partners to enforce consumer protection laws. 

At present, rather than encouraging or enabling effective state enforcement, Fed-
eral  agencies  have  been  an  impediment  and  obstacle.  The  Office  of  Comptroller  of 
the Currency (OCC) has continually—and successfully—scuttled state consumer pro-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:23 Jul 31, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75345.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

30 

tection laws as applied to national banks, Yet, the OCC has been AWOL during the 
recent  mortgage  crisis.  The  Federal  pattern  has  been  to  claim  sole  authority,  and 
then fail or refuse to exercise it. 

The  Federal  Government  must  stand  up  and  speak  out  as  an  aggressive  partner 
with the states in fighting deceptive lending practices, especially affecting subprime 
loans.  The  Federal  Reserve  Board  and  the  Office  of  Comptroller  of  the  Currency 
have  focused  almost  entirely  on  sustaining  and  preserving  the  lending  industry, 
rather than fighting serious illegal activities that harm consumers. 

The combination of Federal power grab and Bush Administration hostility toward 

consumer rights created a perfect storm allowing predatory lending to flourish. 

As  law  enforcement  officials,  state  attorneys  general  have  acted  where  we  could. 
In  2002,  Connecticut  and  18  other  states  compelled  subprime  lender  Household  Fi-
nance  to  pay  consumers  almost  $500  million  for  predatory  lending  practices.  In 
2006,  Connecticut  and  48  other  states  forced  Ameriquest  to  pay  $325  million  for 
anti-consumer actions. 

But these victories are built on sand as long as we face the huge loophole provided 
by  inadequate  Federal  regulation  and  preemption  of  state  law.  We  were  only  able 
to  win  these  settlements  because  Household  Finance  and  Ameriquest  were  state  li-
censed,  giving  the  states  jurisdiction.  Had  they  been  federally  chartered,  the  states 
couldn’t  have  won  a  penny  for  consumers,  no  matter  how  gargantuan  and  glaring 
their violations of the law. 

Indeed,  our  settlement  with  Household  Finance  would  be  impossible  today  be-

cause the company has since obtained a Federal charter. 

I  strongly  support—as  a  good  first  step—the  proposed  initiative  to  empower  the 
Federal  Trade  Commission  (FTC)  to  regulate  the  marketing  of  subprime  loans  and 
to  make  the  states  an  effective  enforcer  of  these  regulations,  along  with  the  FTC. 
Any such regulations should preserve the authority of states to enact even stronger 
protections for consumers. 

Here, Federal preemption should be explicitly eschewed. 
I also urge the Subcommittee to provide immediate concurrent state attorney gen-
eral enforcement authority over the FTC regulations. States should not have to wait 
60 days—as required under the proposed language—to file a lawsuit alleging viola-
tions of the FTC regulations. The proposal provides for an exception if the sixty day 
period  is  not  ‘‘feasible.’’  But  the  meaning  of  feasible  is  ambiguous  at  best.  Notice 
to  the  FTC  of  state  litigation  is  appropriate  but  often  states  will  seek  immediate 
injunctive  relief  to  protect  consumers  from  further  harm.  Such  relief  should  not  be 
delayed  2  months  for  notice  to  the  FTC.  The  proposal  should  either  eliminate  the 
sixty  day  notice  period  or  provide  for  broad  exception  where  waiting  the  sixty  days 
would jeopardize consumers. 

States have been at the forefront for many years in combating abusive and decep-
tive practices pervading the mortgage lending industry—fighting housing loan fraud 
well before the subprime debacle became a public spectacle. 

In our investigations of Household Finance and Ameriquest, we uncovered exten-
sive  abusive  practices,  including  inflated  appraisals,  fabricated  income  statements, 
misrepresentations about prepayment penalties and other loan terms, and illegal or 
deceptive fees and interest rates. Our settlements returned almost $1 billion in res-
titution  to  consumers  nationwide.  Importantly,  both  companies  agreed  to  follow 
strict procedures and disclosure requirements, ensuring fairness to borrowers. 

In  Connecticut,  my  office’s  numerous  active  and  ongoing  investigations  and  legal 

actions have revealed and pursued clearly deceptive and predatory practices: 

• ‘‘One stop shopping’’ predatory lending schemes in which mortgage brokers, real 
estate  agents  and  other  co-conspirators  combine  to  sell  rehabilitated  distressed 
houses  with  structural  flaws,  cosmetically  repaired.  They  typically  target  non- 
English-speaking  first-time  homebuyers  with  impaired  credit.  To  obtain  loans 
for  their  victims,  they  concoct  and  submit  false  income  information,  inflate  ap-
praisals, and conceal the actual terms of the mortgage loans from buyers. 

• Inflated  appraisals  resulting  from  mortgage  brokers  pressuring  appraisers  to 
exaggerate  property  values  by  threatening  explicitly  or  implicitly  to  deny  them 
business. 

• Misrepresentation and non-disclosure of loan terms and interest rates and bait- 
and-switch  tactics  at  closings—typically  targeting  first-time  homebuyers  who 
rely on false assurances from their brokers. 

• Abusive  foreclosure  practices  including  deceptive  and  illegal  fees—a  practice 
that  often  impairs  the  ability  of  distressed  borrowers  to  reach  an  arrangement 
with the lender or mortgage servicer to avoid losing their homes.

31 

States  like  Connecticut  are  also  taking  the  lead  in  developing  a  comprehensive, 
hard-hitting,  proactive  response  to  this  crisis,  even  in  the  face  of  disconcerting  and 
discouraging threats of Federal preemption. Working with key legislative leaders in 
Connecticut  like  State  Senator  Bob  Duff  and  State  Representative  Ryan  Barry,  we 
are  crafting  legislation  to  establish  a  pool  of  funds  that  would  assist  homeowners 
to  stay  in  their  homes  by  replacing  crushing  high-cost  mortgages  with  more  afford-
able loans. The legislation will also impose greater responsibility and specific obliga-
tions  on  the  lending  industry  to  ensure  that  borrowers  can  afford  mortgages—even 
when  the  interest  rates  are  adjusted.  Finally,  the  legislation  will  slow  the  fore-
closure process to provide mortgage companies and homeowners with time to reach 
reasonable solutions that help keep families in homes. 

State  leadership  through  proactive  homeowner  protection  can  promote  a  Federal 
and  state  cooperative  effort  with  a  national  enforcement  footprint  and  impact.  Fed-
eral/state enforcement partnerships are hardly new or novel. Currently, states work 
in  conjunction  with  Federal  agencies  on  a  broad  spectrum  of  cases  including  Med-
icaid  fraud,  antitrust,  and  deceptive  or  misleading  consumer  advertisements.  Fed-
eral  and  state  law  enforcement  agencies  hold  regular  regional  meetings,  exchange 
investigative  information  and  engage  in  other  cooperative  projects.  Because  many 
of the companies that have engaged in deceptive lending practices or predatory lend-
ing  conduct  their  business  in  many  different  states.  Federal  regulations  will  assist 
national  enforcement  efforts  among  states  and  between  the  Federal  Government 
and the states. 

Federal  regulations  regarding  deceptive  practices  should  constitute  a  floor  not  a 
ceiling.  States  should  have  the  authority  to  provide  stricter  and  stronger  consumer 
protections.  Such  an  approach  has  been  successfully  implemented  in  other  similar 
Federal laws—from Do-Not-Call regulations to the Truth in Lending Act. 

I  urge  the  Committee  to  favorably  consider  the  proposed  legislation  to  facilitate 
a  renewed  Federal  and  state  alliance  in  this  area  of  significant  national  and  local 
concern. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Attorney  General  Blumenthal,  thank  you  very 

much for your testimony. 

Next,  we’ll  hear  from  Kathleen  Keest,  who  is  a  Senior  Policy 

Counsel, for the Center for Responsible Lending. 

STATEMENT OF KATHLEEN E. KEEST, SENIOR POLICY 

COUNSEL, CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING 

Ms. KEEST. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you for inviting me 

to testify. 

I’m  going  to  cut  out  a  lot  of  what  my—I  was  going  to  say,  be-
cause  it’s  very  clear  from  your  earlier  comments  that  you  really 
‘‘get  it,’’  and  don’t  need  to  have  a  lot  of  the  benefit  of  my  expla-
nation of what happened. 

And  I’d  like  to  just  start  by  saying  that  I  think  the  provisions 
in  the  proposed  reauthorization  to  get  rid  of  the  Mag-Moss  rule-
making albatross around the FTC’s neck would do a great deal of— 
would  remove  a  great  deal  of  the  impediments  that  they’ve  had  to 
even think about addressing this by rulemaking, and also, the abil-
ity  for—giving  the  ability  for  the  State  Attorney  General’s  to  en-
force it would help a lot. 

A  lot  of  the  State  Attorney  Generals  have  the  authority  under 
State—have parallel authority under State laws, but some of them 
didn’t,  which,  in  Ohio  was  a  good  example  of  that.  Which,  I  think, 
is one of the reasons why Ohio started suffering so early, so badly. 
So,  that’s  going  to  be  a  great  deal  of  help,  and  I  want  to  com-
pliment you for that. 

What—as  I  think  you’ve  noticed,  or  that  you’ve  talked  about, 
part  of  the  real  problem  here  is  the  perverse  incentives  of  the  sec-
ondary  market  who  paid  the  originators  to  push  these  kinds  of 
risky  loans,  and  push  the  risk  layering.  So,  I  think  one  of  the 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:23 Jul 31, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75345.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

32 

things that we need to keep in mind in terms of thinking about the 
problem  is  that,  to  some  extent  we’ve  got  a  little  bit  of  a  parallel 
to  the  drug  problem.  You  know,  we’ve  got  the  difference  between 
going  after  the  kingpins  on  one  hand,  and  the  street  peddlers  on 
the other hand. 

The  advertisements  out  there  are  sort  of  the  street  dealers, 
bringing  the  people  in.  And  it’s  very  important,  and  particularly 
important  for  law  enforcement  to  go  after  that,  but  on  the  other 
hand,  as  long  as  the  kingpins  are  out  there,  and  the  perverse  in-
centives  aren’t  addressed,  to  some  extent,  it’s  a  whack-a-mole 
game. 

And  that’s  by  way  of  saying,  that  while  the  FTC,  I  think,  you 
know,  is—it’s  important  to  get  after  these  things,  this  was  a  sys-
tematic—a  systemic  breakdown.  A  systemic  breakdown  of  no  ac-
countability  and  no  oversight,  and  a  system  that  led  the  self-regu-
lating  nature  that  was  supposed  to  be  in  a  marketplace  to  break 
down. 

And so, there’s a limit to what the FTC can do, and—but within 
those  confines,  I  guess  one  of  the  things  that  I’d  like  to  suggest  is 
that the FTC, one of the things it could do is beef up its use of un-
fairness.  Even  if  we  eliminate  deceptive  advertising,  what  hap-
pened  here,  is  that  the  incentives  were  to  sell  structurally  unfair, 
and  unsuitable  products.  So,  virtually,  the  only  FTC  hook  they 
have  to  do  that  is  to  call  this  unfair—to  get  at  the  kingpins,  in 
other words. 

And,  so  I  think  the  FTC,  sort  of,  at  the  top,  you’ve  said  earlier 
that  for  a  long  time  regulation  has  been  a  four-letter  word  in  this 
city,  and  to  some  extent,  the  use  of  the  unfairness  doctrine  is  one 
of the things that the industry has been most—I guess I could say 
angry about. They feel that that’s just a way for people to interfere 
with a business that they know how to do. 

Whether  or  not,  sort  of,  the  environment  was  such  that  they 
could  have  succeeded  in  using  that  authority  earlier  to  get  at  that 
problem, is sort of a question that it’s too late for us to ask. 

But  the  Agency  hasn’t  done  a  lot  with  its  unfairness  authority, 
and I would suggest that one of the things that this committee can 
do  is—as  I  think,  actually,  the  Chairman  has  done  today—is  en-
courage  it  to  be  more  proactive  in  getting  to  the  root  causes  of  it, 
which is to destroy the incentives that has made it so profitable for 
the street dealers to do what they do. 

Thank you.

committee,  thank  you  for  the  invitation  to  appear  before  you  concerning  what  has 
become  one  of  the  most  important  developments  in  the  U.S.  economy  in  this  young 
century.  We  have  yet  to  know  how  many  families  will  suffer  the  heart-wrenching 
and  economically  devastating  experience  of  being  forced  from  their  homes  and 
neighborhoods  by  foreclosure.  The  most  recent  estimate  is  for  a  total  of  6.5  million 
foreclosures  by  2012.1 The  subprime  industry  itself  is  decimated,  and  the  Inter-

national  Monetary  Fund  recently  estimated  that  direct  mortgage  losses  will  exceed 
$500 billion, and consequential losses could reach nearly a trillion dollars.2 

At root, it was the industry itself that recklessly abandoned sound business sense, 
with the consequences to the economy magnified and multiplied through complex fi-
nancial  instruments  that  spread  the  infection  like  a  pandemic.3 There  were  other 
factors, of course, but the consequences would have been much more contained had 
old  fashioned  common  sense  and  prudence  prevailed.  Though  it  was  highly  profit-
able for a long while, in the end that recklessness ill-served everyone. 

How  could  it  have  gone  so  wrong?  How  could  it  have  gotten  so  far  out  of  hand 
before  anyone  noticed?  Many  are  trying  to  sort  out  what  went  wrong,  and  that  is 
as it should be. It is not simply a finger-pointing ‘‘blame game’’ to do so, for an accu-
rate  diagnosis  is  a  necessary  precondition  both  for  both  effectively  treating  the  re-
sulting problems, and preventing a recurrence. The truth is, there is plenty of blame 
to  go  around.  Many  forces  came  together  to  bring  this  economic  storm  about,  and 
we  can’t  afford  to  ignore  any  of  them  as  we  look  for  solutions  to  today’s  con-
sequences  and  preventions  for  tomorrow.  But  today,  we  look  at  just  one  of  those 
pieces—one agency among many with some authority in the fragmented system. 

My  testimony  today  is  on  behalf  of  the  Center  for  Responsible  Lending  (CRL) 
(www.responsiblelending.org),  a  not-for-profit,  non-partisan  research  and  policy  or-
ganization dedicated to protecting homeownership and family wealth by working to 
eliminate  abusive  financial  practices.  We  are  affiliated  with  a  community  develop-
ment  lender,  Self  Help,  which  provides  carefully  underwritten  subprime  loans  to 
people  who  have  been  under-served  by  other  lenders.  Self  Help  has  provided  over 
$5 billion of financing to 55,000 low-wealth families, small businesses, and nonprofit 
organizations, and our loan losses have been less than 1 percent per year. 

In addition to my experience as a senior policy counsel with CRL, I was previously 
an  assistant  attorney  general  in  Iowa  and  Deputy  Administrator  of  the  Iowa  Con-
sumer  Credit  Code.  This  allows  me  to  bring  to  this  testimony  some  personal  per-
spective on both the possibilities and limitations of public enforcement. 
I.  Introduction:  a  Cursory  Overview  of  the  Rise  and  Fall  of  the  Subprime 

Market 

There are many contributors to the meltdown, and far too many players involved 

to adequately describe in short testimony. But at root, the bottom line is this: 

• Far  too  large  a  portion  of  the  subprime  mortgage  industry  from  its  inception 
has put origination volume ahead of prudent lending practices. Underwriting for 
sustainability never was its strong suit. Nearly half of all subprime loans origi-
nated  in  1999  and  2000  suffered  delinquencies,  and  foreclosures  were  initiated 
at least once on 1 in 4 to 5 subprime loans originated during those years.4 But, 
as  we  shall  see,  other  factors  obscured  those  early  cracks  in  the  foundational 
fundamentals. 
• For  a  long  time,  the  underlying  weakness  in  the  industry  was  obscured  to  all 

but those most closely attuned to that market by at least two factors. 
» First, the share of the subprime market was relatively small, and so ill-effects 
were  relatively  contained.  Some  $138  billion  of  subprime  loans  were  origi-
nated in 2000. By 2006, there were $600 billion in subprime originations, and 
some  $400  billion  of  ‘‘alt-a’’  which  includes  many  of  the  nontraditional  loans, 
particularly payment option ARMs.5 

» Second,  as  long  as  housing  prices  appreciated,  the  troubled  loans  could  avoid 
completed foreclosures by taking the ‘‘exit ramps’’ of refinancing or sale. Ulti-
mately, these loans were paid off—albeit by what is termed ‘‘distress prepay-
ment.’’ These ‘‘distress prepays,’’ many of which led directly to new subprime 
or non-traditional originations,6 disguised the fundamental weaknesses except 

researchandanalysis.  They  estimate  2.7  million  total  subprime  foreclosures  and  4  million  other 
mortgages.

borrowers,  what  data  exists  does  not  support  that  characterization.  Subprime  to  subprime

to  those  who  looked  carefully.  So,  though  nearly  1  in  5  of  the  originations  of 
1999 and 2000 had a foreclosure filed, only about 1 in 8 went to a completed 
foreclosure.  But  when  completed  foreclosures  were  combined  with  ‘‘distress 
prepays,’’  by  May  2005,  almost  1  in  4  subprime  loans  originated  in  those  2 
years had failed to prove sustainable.7 

• The  continuing  inflation  of  the  housing  bubble  in  some  regions  of  the  country, 
the  fact  that  a  large  share  of  the  Nation’s  economy  was  based  on  housing  and 
housing-related activity (including consumer spending generated by the ‘‘wealth 
effect’’ 8)  meant  that  far  too  many  in  public  life  and  the  private  sector  encour-
aged  what,  we  now  see,  is  a  ‘‘debt  bubble’’  that  underlay  the  housing  bubble. 
• The  invention  of  complex  financial  instruments  like  ‘‘collateralized  debt  obliga-
tions,’’ often rated as investment grade, attracted more investors, vastly increas-
ing the secondary market’s demand for these loans. Appetite for the higher-yield 
instruments—which, as theory tells us, are higher yield because they are higher 
risk—increased  at  least  in  part  because  other  complex  financial  instruments 
like ‘‘credit default swaps’’ were thought to insure against the ‘‘risk’’ part of that 
equation.  In  other  words,  the  demand  for  ‘‘riskier’’  investments  increased  be-
cause  they  thought  they  could  get  the  higher  returns  on  the  upside,  while  ‘‘in-
suring’’ against the downside.9 Subprime securitizations jumped from about $52 
billion  in  2000  to  over  $200  billion  in  2007,  according  to  Inside  Mortgage  Fi-
nance MBS database. 

• The perverse incentives from the ‘‘back-end’’ demand side encouraged the origi-
nators to make the riskier kinds of loans, and the voracious appetite from that 
back-end  demand  led  to  a  virtual  abandonment  of  fundamental  underwriting 
principles  in  order  to  generate  loans  to  feed  that  appetite.10 The  combination 
of riskier products and weak underwriting fed off each other in a downward spi-
ral of massive defaults. 

• With the bursting of the housing bubble, and declining housing values even out-
side the ‘‘bubble’’ regions—the ‘‘exit ramps’’ of refinance or sale for troubled bor-
rowers  were  cut  off.  And  then  a  feedback  loop  kicks  in—the  more  housing  val-
ues  decline,  the  more  loans  that  are  caught  in  the  downward  spiral,  which,  in 
turn,  affects  housing  values  of  entire  neighborhoods,  not  just  the  homes  secur-
ing the troubled loans.11 

rowers  are  difficult  to  trace,  and  therefore  rare,  what  evidence  does  exist  does  not  support  the 
‘‘bridge  to  prime’’  hypothesis.  For  example,  in  early  2007,  CRL  reviewed  106  Option  One 
subprime loans originally written in 2004, and found that three in four refinanced into another 
subprime loan, while only 1 in 4 refinanced into a prime loan. ‘‘Case Study in Subprime Hybrid

This  is  the  2-minute  version  of  the  arc  of  the  subprime  and  nontraditional  mort-
gage  meltdown.  It  was,  in  short,  a  systemic  breakdown.  For  purposes  of  today’s 
hearing, we are focusing primarily on the first item on the list—the abuses and the 
breakdown  of  sound  business  practices  in  the  origination  of  these  loans,  and  what 
one  regulator  could—and  could  not—do  about  that.  But  to  understand  what  hap-
pened at that ‘‘front-end’’ of the market, we also have to understand the ‘‘back-end’’ 
of the market—what Wall Street wanted. 
The Supply and Demand(s) of the Subprime Market 

Traditional  economics  thinks  in  terms  of  a  ‘‘supply  and  demand’’  curve.  But  that 
is  not  what  has  been  operating  in  this  market,  especially  over  the  past  five  or  so 
years.  Instead,  the  ‘‘supply’’  side—the  originators  of  subprime  and  non-traditional 
loans—is sandwiched between two ‘‘demand’’ sides.

The  ‘‘front-end’’  demand  (in  theory)  was  from  refinancing  homeowners  and  home 
buyers.  As  a  practical  matter,  however,  much  of  that  front-end  demand  was  ‘‘gen-
erated’’  demand,  not  natural  demand.  In  the  early  years,  these  loans  were  over-
whelmingly  refinance  loans,  and  they  were  ‘‘sold,  not  bought’’—they  were  loans  in 
search of borrowers, not the other way around. But there was a self-feeding nature 
to this market, as the originators wished to ensure continued growth through more 
originations.  There  isn’t  a  great  deal  of  downside  to  assuring  repeat  business  for 
local  grocers—in  fact,  that  helps  keep  those  grocers  on  their  toes.  But  for  sellers  of 
debt—debts  on  which  borrowers  are  contractually  obligated—there’s  a  downside  to 
looking  for  repeat  business—trying  to  get  more  borrowers  deeper  into  debt  and 
keeping them longer carries with it seeds of predictable, and foreseeable, problems. 
Much of the ‘‘product’’ the originators supplied tried to assure that origination vol-
ume  would  ‘‘grow.’’  Whether  the  ‘‘packing  and  flipping’’  model  of  old-line  finance 
companies like Associates that was the ‘‘dysfunctional’’ part of the market attracting 
attention in the early part of this century,12 or the subsequent standard ‘‘exploding 
ARM’’—the  2/28  hybrid  ARM  that  functioned  almost  like  two-year  balloon  loans— 
increasing  origination  volume  was  the  primary  goal.  For  those  lenders  that  sold 
their  loans  on  the  secondary  market,  the  concern  with  how  those  loans  performed 
over  time  was,  to  too  large  a  degree,  ‘‘not  their  problem.’’  Their  job  was  to  make 
loans. It was origination that they were paid for, not performance over time. It was 
somebody else’s problem to live with the consequences—which brings us to the back- 
end demand side. 

More recently, as the housing prices wildly appreciated in some areas of the coun-
try,  a  larger  portion  of  subprime  loans  (though  still  a  minority)  and  nontraditional 
loans  were  used  to  purchase  homes.  But  the  core  problem  was  the  disconnect  be-
tween  houses  prices  and  affordability.  The  housing  affordability  index  in  California 
in 2005 was just around 14 percent.13 Though the answer to a housing affordability 
problem  is  not  unaffordable  mortgages,  we  pretended  as  though  it  was,  and  the 
same  weak  underwriting—perhaps  even  worse—infected  the  purchase  money  mar-
ket.14 

12 ‘‘Equity  stripping  through  insurance  packing,  fee-padding,  and  loan  flipping  (frequent  refi-
nances by the same lender) was the ‘‘abuse du jour’’ as the century turned. Several state legisla-
tures,  including  North  Carolina,  enacted  state  ‘‘HOEPAs’’  that  closed  the  loophole  in  Federal 
HOEPA that these lenders exploited; and the Federal Reserve Board amended Federal HOEPA 
to close one of the loopholes, by making single-premium credit insurance count toward HOEPA’s 
8-percent  fee  trigger.  On  the  enforcement  side,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  brought  an  en-
forcement  action  against  Associates  (which  was  purchased  by  Citigroup  during  the  investiga-
tion), settled for $215 million, and the states brought an enforcement action against Household, 
settling in 2002 for $484 million. It is worth noting that Associates and Household were among 
the three subprime originators each year in 1998–2002. In 2001, the year before the enforcement 
actions were settled, they held 20 percent of the subprime market share between them. 

13 In  2005,  the  average  income  within  the  4th  quintile—the  second  highest  quintile—was  ap-
proximately $70,000. Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, Arloc Sherman, ‘‘Income Inequality

the loans were 100 percent loan-to-value from the day they were made. And with products like

The  ‘‘back-end’’  demand  side  was  the  secondary  market—investors  looking  for  in-
vestments  to  buy.  The  way  it  let  its  guard  down  by  creating  what  it  thought  of  as 
graded  risk,  widely  dispersed  risk,  and  insured-risk  is  a  story  for  another  day  and 
another  hearing.15 As  it  relates  to  the  practices  of  the  originators,  though  the  bot-
tom line is that Wall Street valued most highly (that is, paid the most for) precisely 
the kinds of products and terms that made the loans most risky for the borrowers.16 
In  short,  the  secondary  market  created  perverse  incentives,  and  the  originators  re-
sponded to those perverse incentives. 

For  those  who  apply  common  sense,  not  complex  mathematical  models,  to  busi-
ness,  this  has  been  one  of  the  most  maddening  aspects  of  the  meltdown:  the  ‘‘what 
were  they  thinking?’’  factor.  Give  it  just  a  moment’s  thought.  There  are  roughly 
three  categories  of  default  risk:  borrower  risk—the  ‘‘creditworthiness’’  of  the  bor-
rower;  macroeconomic  risks—unemployment,  housing  prices;  and  loan  product  and 
term  risks.  That  is  to  say,  some  kinds  of  loan  products  and  some  loan  terms  them-
selves  exacerbate  the  risk  of  default  and  foreclosure,  irrespective  of  borrower 
traits.17 In  an  industry  that  claimed  to  be  serving  a  niche  where  the  ‘‘borrower’’ 
risks  were  higher  (setting  aside  the  question  of  steering),  common  sense  would  tell 
a  lender  to  minimize  the  risk  from  the  other  two  factors  by  selling  the  least  risky 
loan  products  and  terms.  (That’s  what  the  sensible  19  and  20  year  olds  in  an  eco-
nomics  class  recently  said  when  I  put  the  question  to  them.)  Instead  the  standard 
industry practice was to compound the risk by making the standard products on the 
market  the  riskiest  kinds  of  products—they  pushed  the  products  and  loans  terms 
that made these loans more, not less, likely to default. 

Why would they do that? There are a number of reasons. In part, ignoring under-
writing  to  push  a  borrower  to  the  maximum  on  capacity  to  pay,  or  pushing  an  ex-
ploding  ARM  is  likely  to  force  the  borrower  into  seeking  a  refinance  later—a  new 
origination.  In  part,  some  of  the  products,  like  teaser-rate  ARMs  and  POARMs  are 
tailor-made  for  deceptive  sales  pitches—low-balling  the  monthly  payments  made  it 
easier to sell a complex, risky loan. But the biggest incentive of all was the perverse 
incentive—the  fact  that  those  were  the  products  and  terms  that  Wall  Street  paid 
the originators the most for. In the end, it was the ‘‘back-end’’ demand, with its in-
creasingly  voracious  appetite  asking  for  more  and  more  volume,  and  paying  those 
originators  more  for  the  toxic  products  than  the  less  remunerative  ‘‘plain  vanilla’’ 
products, that drove this market. 

That’s  a  birds-eye  view  of  what  happened.  There  was  a  very  long  supply  chain 
along the way—from local brokers and settlement agents to national lenders to glob-
al investment houses. Deconstructing what happened to oversight, then,—the ques-
tion  of  ‘‘who  was  minding  the  store’’—isn’t  simple.  This  wasn’t  ‘‘a  store’’—this  was 
a mega-mall, and lapses in security were everywhere. The unfettered explosion and 
subsequent implosion raises questions of whether deregulation of both lending mar-
kets and investment markets went too far. It raises questions of whether legislators, 
regulators  and  the  public  did  have,  or  could  have  had,  adequate  insight  into  what 
was  happening  in  time  to  have  stopped  it.  It  raises  questions  about  whether  regu-
lators  had  adequate  tools,  adequate  resources,  or  adequate  will  to  have  done  some-
thing more. And if not, what do they need for the next time. 

Today, we look at only one aspect of this process: the practices of the non-deposi-
tory  originators  as  they  dealt  with  consumers  (the  ‘‘front-end’’  demand  side):  first, 
how  well  equipped  was  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  to  deal  with  the  problems 
on  its  watch,  and,  second,  within  the  limits  it  faced,  how  well  did  it  perform.  We 
believe  that  for  it  to  have  performed  optimally,  it  needed  better  tools  and  more  re-
sources. But within the confines of those limitations, could it have done more? Prob-
ably yes.

ciation.

more  than  a  loan’s  face  value  for  A.R.M.’s  that  carried  prepayment  penalties,  for  instance,  be-
cause the products locked borrowers into high-interest-rate loans with apparently predictable in-

creased  likelihood  of  default  for  several  kinds  of  loan  terms,  such  as  prepayment  penalties  and

II. ‘‘Regulation’’—It Comes in Different Flavors 

Before evaluating the FTC’s performance as a regulator, it is necessary to distin-
guish  among  kinds  of  regulation.  As  the  industry  began  to  unravel,  it  was  common 
to  hear  that  these  loans  were  mostly  made  by  the  ‘‘unregulated’’  segment  of  the 
mortgage market—non-depository lenders. In fact, virtually the only major segment 
of  this  daisy  chain  that  is  truly  unregulated  is  the  very  tail  end—the  complex  de-
rivatives  market.18 But  there  are  differences  in  the  kinds  of  regulation  and  over-
sight to which the various segments were subject. There is substantive regulation— 
the laws and rules that set down the rules of the game. There is oversight—routine 
and  regular  monitoring  that  allows  regulators  on-going  access  to  the  regulated  in-
dustry to keep on top of its compliance. Finally, there is enforcement—investigating 
alleged violations and prosecuting them after the fact. 
A. The Underlying Infrastructure: Legal Authority and Political Will 

Regulatory agencies are creations of the law, and have only the authority that the 
law  gives  them.  The  scope  of  their  authority  is  set  by  the  law  that  creates  them: 
The  laws  they  enforce  with  respect  to  the  entities  within  their  jurisdiction  are  only 
those that the legislative branch—Federal or state as relevant—enacts. And finally, 
the  resources  they  have  to  do  their  job  with  are  determined  by  their  enabling  law. 
In  other  words,  it  all  starts  with  elected  officials—here  in  Congress,  and  out  in 
the  state  capitols.  An  agency  may  be—and  should  be—taken  to  task  if  it  does  not 
use the tools it has to tackle a problem. But if the agency’s jurisdiction is inadequate 
in the first place, it is because the enabling laws make it so; if the laws the agency 
is to enforce are inadequate, it is Congress and the state legislatures that must act 
first  to  strengthen  them;  if  the  resources  are  inadequate,  and  the  agency  is  funded 
by appropriations, then it is the body that makes the appropriations that must step 
up and reassess its spending priorities. As we will see, some, though not all, of the 
FTC’s inadequate responses can be traced back here. 

While  the  tools  and  the  resources  must  be  sufficient,  so  too  must  be  the  will  of 
the agency’s leadership. No matter how strong or weak the regulatory infrastructure 
is,  it  depends  upon  the  will  of  the  regulator  to  make  the  most  of  what  it  has.  If 
a  regulator—any  regulator—believes  that  the  best  regulation  is  the  least  regula-
tion—then  it  matters  little  what  the  regulatory  structure  looks  like.  Regulators 
must  believe  in  the  importance  of  their  job  in  order  to  do  it  right.  For  nearly  three 
decades, the prevailing political and economic philosophy has been that the markets 
work best when left alone, with minimal intervention. Whether that was part of the 
problem, and contributed to a too-weak regulatory response is a legitimate question. 
It  is,  however,  ultimately  is  a  political  question.  We  will  not  discuss  it  today,  but 
only note that it is a question that must be answered at some point. 
B.  The  Legal  Tools:  The  Substantive  Law  Relating  to  Abuses  in  the  Subprime  and 

Non-traditional Market 

In  our  2-minute  overview  of  the  root  of  the  problem,  we  identified  a  few  areas 

of abuse in the origination marketplace. 

Marketing:  Sometimes  there  were  misleading  advertisements,  although  often  the 
problem  with  subprime  ads  was  not  misrepresentations  about  cost  or  terms,  but  a 
complete  absence  of  information  about  costs  or  terms.  While  prime  borrowers  could 
easily  find  information  about  prevailing  rates  for  ‘‘plain  vanilla’’  fixed  rate  mort-
gages, there was very little transparency about prices and terms for subprime mar-
kets. While advertising rules in the Truth in Lending Act,19 or general prohibitions 
against  deceptive  advertising  practices  set  some  ground  rules,  there  was  nothing 
clearly illegal about advertising of what could be called the ‘‘ ‘Come into my parlor,’ 
said the spider to the fly’’ variety.20 Though some of the ‘‘trust us’’ variety of adver-
tising could be argued to create a fiduciary duty or related duty for originators, this 
was an area of the law that was in flux through out this period. 

Moving  from  mass  marketing  to  individual  sales  marketing,  there  are  some  spe-
cific requirements—mostly regarding disclosures. The Truth in Lending Act requires 
some early disclosures about loan costs and repayment terms for mortgage lending, 
and  more  disclosures  at  closing.  The  Real  Estate  Settlement  Procedures  Act 
(RESPA) requires some early disclosures and closing disclosures about closing costs.

19 15  U.S.C.  §§ 1661–1665b.  These  rules  do  not  require  that  price  terms  be  advertised.  If  the 
lender  chooses  to  disclose  some  ‘‘trigger  terms,’’  then  the  rules  require  some  additional  disclo-
sures.

But  generally,  it  is  simply  the  prohibition  against  ‘‘unfair  and  deceptive  acts  and 
practices’’  in  commerce  that  is  an  agency’s  primary  tool  to  attack  deception  in  a 
sales pitches. 

Loan Terms and Products: There is little substantive law that governs loan prod-
ucts  and  terms.  In  some  states,  some  of  the  higher-cost,  higher  fee  loans  were  sub-
ject to additional requirements by the ‘‘state-HOEPAs,’’ but, for the most part, those 
laws  took  aim  at  the  kinds  of  abuses  that  were  more  prevalent  in  the  predominant 
business models in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In fact, to some extent, Federal 
law made it impossible for states to squarely address in substance some of the risk- 
enhancing  products.  One  of  the  unintended  consequences  of  the  1982  Alternative 
Mortgage  Transaction  Parity  Act  (AMTPA),  which  preempted  state  laws  limiting 
‘‘creative’’ mortgages—like adjustable rate loans and balloon loans, was to encourage 
the growth of ARMs to take advantage of that Federal preemption.21 That same law 
preempted  state  laws  on  prepayment  penalties  from  1996  to  July  1,  2003  in  most 
states—another ‘‘risk-enhancing term.’’ 

Perverse  Incentives  and  Conflicts  of  Interest:  There  are  few  laws  in  place  to  effec-
tively  address  the  perverse  incentives  that  led  originators  to  respond  to  Wall 
Street’s  incentives  to  push  the  higher-cost,  riskier  loans.  At  the  beginning  of  the 
subprime  era,  the  trade  association  of  mortgage  brokers  considered  themselves  to 
owe a duty to their customers, and some courts had held that there was a fiduciary 
duty.22 

But the industry’s self-image changed, and it became a legal battle as to whether 
brokers  had  a  duty  to  provide  their  customers  with  the  most  appropriate  and  best 
loan for them. While individuals could, and did use the common law regarding fidu-
ciary duty, and UDAP claims as a tool, as a clear and potent message to deter such 
practices  industry-wide,  it  was  insufficient.  And  creditors  making  their  own  loans 
have  never  had  such  a  duty.  As  the  fundamental  problem  of  putting  people  into 
loans  ill-suited  to  their  needs  and  situations,  it  was  only  as  the  crisis  became  too 
great  to  be  ignored  did  state  legislatures  respond.  Since  the  spring  of  2006,  several 
states  have  enacted  laws  that  specifically  impose  on  originators  some  kind  of  duty 
with respect to their customers.23 The Federal Government has yet to respond. The 
Federal Reserve Board has proposed some UDAP regulations pursuant to its author-
ity  under  the  Home  Owners  Equity  Protection  Act  (HOEPA),  but  we  believe  that 
those rules, if enacted as proposed, would not significantly reduce these perverse in-
centives. 

Weakened Underwriting: The massive failure of underwriting, one of the most fun-
damental  causes  of  the  break  down,  is  the  conduct  that  the  existing  law  was  per-
haps  most  inadequate  to  address.  While  there  is  legal  precedent  to  argue  that  it  is 
‘‘unconscionable’’  or  unfair  to  make  a  loan  knowing  that  there  is  little  reasonable 
probability  of  repayment,24 that,  too,  has  been  more  successful  on  an  individual 
basis than system-wide. In fact, with respect to the highest cost loans, those subject 
to  the  Federal  HOEPA,  there  is  a  prohibition  against  a  ‘‘pattern  and  practice’’  of 
making  loans  without  regard  to  the  ability  to  repay,  but  as  long  ago  as  1998,  the 
FRB and HUD admitted that was very difficult to enforce.25 

Here, too, the recent spate of state laws that began to address the current genera-
tion of abuses addressed the need to consider ability to repay. Federal financial reg-
ulators  issued  underwriting  guidances  for  non-traditional  loans  in  2006,  and  for 
subprime  loans  in  2007.26 Many  state  financial  regulators  adopted  parallel  guide-
lines  shortly  thereafter.  The  FRB’s  proposed  HOEPA  UDAP  rules  would  extend  to 
the subprime market a prohibition against a ‘‘pattern and practice’’ of making loans 
without  regard  to  ability  to  repay.  However,  as  the  Board  admitted  a  decade  ago

to federally chartered institutions.)

that it was a rule difficult to enforce, it seems equally an equally unpromising solu-
tion today. 

Of  the  laws  that  might  be  applied  to  the  abuses  in  the  market,  the  primary  one 
within  the  FTC  scope  of  authority  was  section  45  of  the  FTC  Act,  the  Federal 
UDAP. Though the FTC has authority to enforce the Truth in Lending Act and the 
Equal  Credit  Opportunity  Act,  among  others,  the  nature  of  the  recent  abuses  were 
such that its UDAP authority was the primary weapon available to it. However, the 
FTC’s ability to wield that weapon is governed by rules of engagement which make 
it difficult to prevent abuses. 
C. Prophylactic vs. Retrospective Regulation: Prevention vs. Law Enforcement 

Regulation  can  be  forward  looking—preventative,  or  it  can  be  retrospective.  They 
can  set  the  standards  to  be  met,  and  exercise  oversight  to  continually  monitor  the 
market  to  assure  compliance.  Or  it  can  be  retrospective—an  investigation  begins 
only  after  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  violations  have  occurred,  and  prosecution 
follows. 

Preventive regulation comes in two forms: rule-making and routine oversight, that 
is,  regular,  recurring  monitoring  for  compliance  with  the  ground  rules.  The  law-en-
forcement model—the one available to the FTC, is retrospective. By definition, it has 
preventive value only to the extent that the fear of prosecution deters potential vio-
lators.  In  assessing  the  FTC’s  performance,  it  is  useful  to  compare  its  capacity  for 
preventive regulatory action with that of financial regulators. 
1. Rule-making: The FTC’s ‘‘Mag-Moss’’ Albatross 

The  FTC  has  rule-making  authority  to  define  ‘‘unfair  or  deceptive  acts  and  prac-
tices’’ in commerce generally: it is a ‘‘generalist’’ with a scope that encompasses the 
practices for all of American’s businesses—except those that are explicitly entrusted 
to  another  agency,  such  as  federally  chartered  depository  institutions.  Federal 
UDAP rule-making authority for federally chartered depository institutions is given 
to  the  Federal  Reserve  (for  banks),  the  OTS  (for  thrifts)  and  NCUA  (for  credit 
unions.) 27 If  the  FTC  promulgates  a  relevant  UDAP  rule,  such  as  one  which  deals 
with  consumer  credit,  then  the  Federal  banking  agencies  are  mandated  to  enact 
‘‘me-too’’  rules,  unless  they  determine  it  is  not  ‘‘unfair  or  deceptive’’  when  a  deposi-
tory  institution  does  it,  or  when  the  FRB  deems  it  would  interfere  with  monetary 
and payment system functions. 

The  FTC  has  promulgated  some  UDAP  rules  which  have  been  very  important  in 
making the consumer finance marketplace fairer and more honest. Of particular im-
portance  is  the  ‘‘preservation  of  claims  and  defenses  rule,’’ 28 which  assures  that 
lenders that finance merchants can’t separate the consumer’s obligation to pay from 
the seller’s obligation to comply with the law and contract. 

Unfortunately,  Congress  in  1975  enacted  a  special  rule-making  procedure  which 
the  FTC  must  use  to  promulgate  rules  defining  what  ‘‘unfair  and  deceptive  prac-
tices’’  are.  This  so-called  ‘‘Magnuson-Moss’’  or  ‘‘Mag-Moss’’  rule-making  is  much 
more  cumbersome,  lengthy,  and  expensive,  than  the  standard  agency  ‘‘notice-and- 
comment’’  rule-making  procedure  prescribed  by  the  Administrative  Procedures  Act. 
Just how much of an albatross this ‘‘Mag-Moss’’ rule-making procedure has been for 
FTC’s  UDAP  rule-making  is  evident  from  its  experience  with  the  Credit  Practices 
Rule. 

It  was  standard  practice  in  consumer  finance  contracts  to  use  boiler  plate  lan-
guage  in  adhesion  contracts  that  let  the  creditors  engage  in  harsh  collection  tac-
tics—waivers  of  exemptions  even  when  the  credit  did  not  finance  the  acquisition  of 
the  exempt  goods,  or  taking  wage  assignments.  The  proposal  began  internal  devel-
opment in the early 1970s, and the proposed rule was published in 1975. As it hap-
pened, this was my first year as a practicing lawyer. Under the Mag-Moss rule-mak-
ing,  industry  has  an  opportunity  to  turn  rule-making  into  a  quasi-legislative  proc-
ess, complete with hearings and the right to cross-examine. My own first foray into 
the  national  scene  of  consumer  law  was  to  testify  at  one  of  the  regional  hearings 
the FTC held on the proposal, in October, 1977, where I was questioned by industry 
representatives.  Fat  volumes  were  published  with  the  report  from  the  hearing  and 
recommendations  over  the  next  few  years—two,  if  memory  serves.  The  final  rule 
was  published  in  1984,  to  be  effective  in  1985.  There  was  a  legal  challenge  to  the 
rule  from  the  industry—under  Mag-Moss,  there  are  even  special  rules  for  judicial 

27 15 U.S.C. § 57a(f). 
28 16 C.F.R. § 433, effective 1975.

review  of  these  rules.  Finally,  some  10  years  after  it  was  first  proposed,  the  U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit upheld the rule and it became effective.29 

During the process for the ‘‘credit practices rule,’’ I went from a totally green new 
practitioner to a consumer specialist with a decade’s experience. Clearly, Mag-Moss’ 
rule-making  procedure  is  not  a  recipe  for  a  nimble  regulatory  response  to  rapidly 
evolving dysfunctions in the marketplace. 
2. Oversight—Routine Monitoring 

Another way an agency can get ahead of the curve to prevent abuses or stop them 
before  they  get  out  of  hand  is  through  the  exercise  of  oversight  authority.  The  dis-
tinction  between  the  regulatory  authority  over  depository  lenders  and  non-deposi-
tory  lenders  is  particularly  stark  here,  because  so  much  of  the  root  failure  here— 
the  collapse  of  underwriting  standards—occurred  in  the  ‘‘back  offices.’’  Unlike  ear-
lier  trends  in  predatory  lending—insurance  packing  and  ‘‘equity-stripping’’  which 
was  visible  on  the  face  of  the  consumers’  loan  documents,  failure  of  underwriting 
is almost asymptomatic until the failure starts showing up in performance. Asymp-
tomatic,  that  is,  unless  it  is  happens  in  depository  institutions,  where  regulators 
routinely examine for ‘‘safety and soundness.’’ 

To argue that pushing inappropriate loans on borrowers, or failing to underwrite, 
fell  on  the  ‘‘illegal’’  side  of  the  UDAP  law,  or  in  a  grey  area  is  one  issue  the  FTC 
had  to  resolve  for  itself,  but  clearly  financial  regulators  can  do  so.  Because  deposi-
tory institutions hold depositors money, and because those deposits are generally in-
sured by the FDIC, ‘‘safety and soundness’’ oversight is the core mission of financial 
regulators.  Financial  regulators  therefore  have  routine  access  through  their  exam-
ination  authority.  Whether  the  financial  regulators  paid  enough  attention  to  both 
the  origination  and  investment  activities  of  their  institutions  is  a  question  for  an-
other  day  and  another  committee,30 but  as  to  today’s  question—the  FTC,  by  con-
trast, does not have this clear ‘‘safety and soundness’’ authority. 

In  sum,  the  FTC  was  not  the  best  equipped  agency  to  engage  in  prevention.  Its 
UDAP  rule-making  does  not  give  it  the  flexibility  and  nimbleness  necessary  to  re-
sponse  to  fast-moving  abuses  in  the  marketplace,  and  it  can  only  act  once  evidence 
of a problem surfaces outside the internal walls of the lender, such as from a whis-
tleblower,  or  an  accumulation  of  complaints.  Its  preventative  capacity,  then,  is  all 
tied up in whether its enforcement is sufficiently vigorous to act as a deterrent. 
3. Law Enforcement—Prosecutions and Deterrence 

Earlier  in  this  testimony,  I’ve  intimated  that  the  nature  of  the  predominant 
abuses  in  the  subprime  market  have  shifted  over  the  past  decade.  The  root  causes 
of  the  most  recent  crisis  we’ve  identified  as  a  massive  failure  of  underwriting  and 
‘‘suitability’’  (for  want  of  a  better  word  to  describe  appropriately  matching  product 
and borrower). 

Before  that,  the  visible  abuses  were  the  ‘‘packing,  stripping  and  flipping’’  model. 
The  combination  of  state  laws,  the  FRB’s  amendment  to  add  credit  insurance  pre-
miums to the list of HOEPA’s trigger fees, the FTC’s enforcement action against As-
sociates  and  the  states’  action  against  Household  in  fact  did  send  strong  deterrent 
messages to the industry. 

Unfortunately,  the  message  received  by  the  industry  was—‘‘don’t  engage  in  those 
particular abuses.’’ The shift in the kinds of abusive practices was even more prob-
lematic,  as  it  turned  out.  As  to  the  new  generation  of  problem  practices,  one  might 
offer an explanation for the FTC’s caution, if not a justification. The FTC is a ‘‘gen-
eralist’’  agency,  whose  expertise  is  in  general  unfair  and  deceptive  business  prac-
tices  and  fair  competition.  The  central  abuses  of  the  past  few  years—underwriting 
and  suitability—might  have  seemed  more  within  the  purview  of  ‘‘specialist’’  finan-
cial regulators. Further, absent misrepresentations, those abuses may more properly 
fall  within  the  ‘‘unfairness’’  rubric.  So,  while  deceptive  sales  representations  are 
clearly covered by ‘‘deception,’’ for an agency that seems uncomfortable in enforcing 
its  unfairness  jurisdiction  in  any  case,  it  is  easy  to  explain  an  institutional  caution 
about attacking the root abuses with its UDAP authority. 

That  is  not  to  say  that  such  caution  was  necessary.  Indeed,  the  states’  action 
against Ameriquest, number one among subprime originators for 3 years before the 

29 American Financial Serv. Assoc. v. FTC, 767 F.2d 957 (1985), cert den. (1986). 
30 Arguments  that  ‘‘non-bank’’  originators  were  primarily  responsible  for  the  shaky  practices 
ignore  the  extent  to  which  their  practices  were  driven  by  the  ‘‘back-end  demand’’  we  described 
earlier. And certainly depository institutions were a part of that aspect, as the losses and write- 
downs  taken  by  major  banks  indicate.  See,  e.g.,  Todd  Davenport,  OCC:  Banks  Lost  $10B  on  4Q 
Trading,  Am.  Banker  (April  3,  2008).  Additionally,  some  of  the  highly  questionable  practices 
concerning non-traditional loans have come from depositories, see, e.g., Andrews v. Chevy Chase 
Bank, 240 F.R.D. 612 (E.D. Wis. 2007), app. pending.

states case was completed and publicized,31 was an example of the states using the 
parallel state UDAP authority to reach this most recent generation of abusive prac-
tices.  Even  more  on  point,  the  Massachusetts  Attorney  General  posed  the  question 
squarely,  by  filing  a  lawsuit  charging  that  Fremont  Investment  &  Loan’s  practices 
were  such  as  to  make  their  loans  structurally  unfair,  in  violation  of  the  Massachu-
setts UDAP statute.32 
III. Necessary Preconditions for Effective Regulation 

For  any  public  regulator  to  be  effective  in  their  role  as  watchdogs  for  the  public, 

they require several things: 

• Tools.  They  need  adequate  laws,  and  the  authority  to  enforce  those  laws.  The 
UDAP  law  was  the  most  relevant  tool.  An  aggressive  Commission  could  have 
done  more,  but  then  again,  Congress  could  have  provided  them  both  more  tar-
geted tools, and more encouragement to take on this industry. 
• Resources.  The  FTC  is  the  default  agency  charged  with  policing  most  of  the 
market: everyone not specifically assigned elsewhere is under the FTC’s watch, 
from the major mortgage loan servicers and originators to a mom-and-pop pay-
day  store  to  telemarketing  fraudsters  to  identity  theft  to  purveyors  of  phony 
health  products.  Resources  are  obviously  a  problem.  But  even  looking  just  at 
this  one  slice  of  American  commerce,  when  the  business  standards  of  a  $600 
billion  industry  fall  so  far  that  bad  practices  are  the  norm,  not  the  exception, 
public enforcement resources will be insufficient. 
• Expertise.  At  the  Federal  level,  the  FTC  is  the  agency  with  expertise  in  unfair 
and deceptive acts and practices. Financial regulators are the agencies with the 
expertise in the fundamentals of banking and lending.33 The SEC is the agency 
with  expertise  in  the  secondary  market.  This  crisis  implicated  all  of  them. 
Though  the  Federal  financial  agencies  coordinated  responses,  such  as  the  joint 
guidances, perhaps fragmented oversight kept anyone from looking at the whole 
picture until it was too late. 
• Undivided loyalty to the public good. The FTC is funded primarily by appropria-
tions,  and  is  answerable  to  the  taxpayers.  By  contrast,  some  of  the  Federal  fi-
nancial regulators are funded by the entities they regulate, raising the prospect 
of  ‘‘regulatory  capture.’’  To  make  matters  worse,  depositories  can  choose  their 
regulator—they  can  choose  between  state  and  Federal  regulators,  and  choose 
among Federal regulators, raising the prospect of ‘‘charter competition,’’ as reg-
ulators  may  be  unduly  soft  on  their  own  to  capture  their  own  ‘‘market  share.’’ 
The FTC, therefore, has no inherent conflict of interest. 

IV. The FTC’s Enforcement Record on Predatory Lending 

As of last September, the FTC had brought 21 actions relating to mortgage lend-
ing.34 It  includes  actions  against  some  of  the  major  subprime  lenders  of  their  day: 
Associates,  First  Alliance  (in  which  it  cooperated  with  state  enforcement),  Delta 
Funding  (also  in  cooperation  with  state  enforcement),  and  a  servicing  case  against 
one of the biggest—and worst—subprime servicers (Fairbanks.) The Associates case 
began  as  a  broad-based  challenge  to  a  wide  array  of  abuses,  though  the  settlement 
focused just on one of them. 

However,  as  to  the  core  abuses  that  are  more  directly  responsible  for  today’s  cri-
sis, there is less activity—perhaps for the reasons we have described. Though it de-
scribes actions relating to deception and misrepresentation against some originators, 
including brokers, it does not appear to have squarely addressed the present abuses 
as  violations  of  the  UDAP  law  in  and  of  themselves.  The  state  of  Massachusetts, 
instead, has taken the lead. 

Some of its targets illustrate a persistent choice facing public enforcement officials 
with limited resources: how to prioritize between local actors doing greater harm to 
fewer people, and national actors doing somewhat less harm, but to many more peo-

time,  what  appears  to  be  a  ‘‘lesser  harm’’  but  one  visited  on  far  more  people,  can 
get out of hand. As we are seeing now, the consequences to the economy as a whole 
can be grave indeed. 

In  sum,  the  FTC  has  done  more  enforcement  than  other  Federal  regulators,  de-
spite  having  less  capacity  to  spot  problems  early  one.  However,  it  could  have  done 
more to get to the root causes of today’s problem. 
V. Recommendations 

We appreciate the efforts of Senators Dorgan and Inouye in S. 2831, the proposal 

to reauthorize the FTC. There are several provisions that we especially welcome: 

Changes  to  the  Mag-Moss  Rule-making.  We  particularly  welcome  Section  9  of 
S.  2831,  which  mandates  the  use  of  the  APA  rule-making,  rather  than  Mag- 
Moss  rule-making  regarding  subprime  and  non-traditional  laws.  We  rec-
ommend,  however,  that  the  APA  rule-making  be  used  for  all  consumer  protec-
tion  rules.  Section  8  of  the  bill,  gives  the  Commission  the  authority  to  waive 
Mag-Moss rule-making for any consumer protection rule, but does not mandate 
the change as it does for mortgage rules. We believe that the current crisis dem-
onstrates  that  consumer  protection  regulation  is  key  to  protecting  an  efficient 
economy—protecting it from wild swings of excess. Congress could send a strong 
message  to  the  Commission  that  consumer  protection,  far  from  being  a  ‘‘drag’’ 
on commerce, is essential to a fair and efficient economy, and that the Commis-
sion should be proactive. 
Cooperative  rule-making  with  bank  regulatory  agencies.  S.  2831  would  give  the 
FTC  concurrent  rule-making  with  Federal  bank  regulatory  agencies,  and  re-
quires  consultation  and  coordination  ‘‘to  the  extent  practicable.’’  We  have  rec-
ommended  elsewhere  independent  and  concurrent  authority  as  a  result  of  con-
cerns  about  regulatory  capture.  We  recognize  that  there  are  limits  to  this  com-
mittee’s  jurisidiction,  and  we  welcome  the  steps  taken  in  S.  2831.  We  would 
hope, however, that Congress will make further refinements, to assure that ade-
quate  consumer  protection  rules  apply  to  all  lenders.  If  the  bank  regulatory 
agencies  do  not  act  when  they  should,  we  believe  that  the  FTC  should  have 
independent  jurisdiction  to  do  so,  with  due  regard  for  the  need  for  appropriate 
safety and soundness adjustments for depository institutions. 
State  Attorneys  General’s  authority  to  enforce  Federal  UDAP  law.  Giving  state 
attorneys general authority to enforce Federal UDAP law and other laws within 
the  FTC’s  enforcement  authority  with  respect  to  subprime  or  nontraditional 
loan is welcome. Adding fifty ‘‘cops on the beat’’ to supplement the FTC’s limited 
resources will be of immeasurable help. While many state UDAP laws provided 
state  AGs  with  jurisdiction  over  lending  practices,  that  is  not  universally  the 
case.  For  example,  until  recently,  Ohio’s  UDAP  statute  exempted  mortgage 
lenders from coverage. Neither Ohio’s attorney general nor its citizens had that 
tool  available  to  them  to  challenge  abuses  in  the  subprime  market.  Undoubt-
edly, that was a contributing factor to the serious foreclosure crisis in Ohio. 

As  we  understand  the  proposed  provision  that  prevents  a  state  AG  from  exer-
cising  this  new  authority  when  the  FTC  has  instituted  an  action,35 the  preemption 
would  not  preclude  the  AG  from  exercising  any  investigation  and  enforcement  au-
thority  of  state  or  Federal  laws  that  it  has  pursuant  to  its  own  state  law.  We  hope 
that this is made abundantly clear. 

Aiding and abetting liability. In today’s complex marketplace, few transactions in-
volve only a consumer and seller of goods or services. Clarifying aiding and abetting 
liability will help assure that all those involved can be reached by the law. 

The  bill  should  include  a  private  enforcement  right  for  consumers.  There  is  one 
change  not  present  in  S.  2831  which  we  continue  to  recommend.  Congress  should 
provide  a  private  right  of  action  to  enable  consumers  to  enforce  their  own  right  to 
be free of unfair and deceptive acts and practices, for the FTC’s resources will never 
be  adequate  to  police  the  entire  market,  and  public  enforcement  will  never  move 
fast-enough  to  prevent  the  foreclosures  that  are  occurring—homeowner  by  home-
owner—all over the country. 

Thank  you  again  for  providing  me  with  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on  this 

important matter. I’m happy to answer any questions you might have. 

Senator DORGAN. Thank you very much.

tion of Consumer Advocates. 

Mr. Rheingold, you may proceed. 
STATEMENT OF IRA J. RHEINGOLD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES 

Mr.  RHEINGOLD.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Like  Ms.  Keest,  I’m 
going  to  adapt  my  remarks,  and  cut  out  a  lot  of  what  I  was  going 
to  say,  because  it’s  clear  that  you  understand  exactly  what’s  been 
happening  in  this  mortgage  marketplace.  And  I’m  going  to  talk  a 
little  bit  about  what  we  saw  here  today,  what’s  wrong  with  our 
marketplace,  and  what  some  of  the  solutions,  maybe,  we  need, 
going forward. 

I should offer what my perspective is, because I have been work-
ing on this issue for more than a dozen years. I was a legal assist-
ance  attorney  in  Chicago,  running  a  home  foreclosure  prevention 
project in the late-1990s, and did that for a number of years. 

I now run a project called the Institute for Foreclosure Legal As-
sistance, where we are funding attorneys from around this country, 
to fight against some of the foreclosure problems that we’re seeing. 
I talk—on a daily basis—to the attorneys on the front line, trying 
to stop foreclosures. I’ve litigated cases against all of the mortgage 
lenders,  way  back  in  the  1990s.  The  practices  that  we’re  seeing 
today existed in a lot of low-income communities across urban and 
rural landscapes in this country for a long time. 

What’s  happened  is,  it  has  spread.  It  has  spread  to  the  entire 
marketplace.  And  I  think  it’s  important,  as  I  speak,  I  hear  the 
voices of all of the consumers I’ve talked to over the years—because 
I’ve  looked  at  thousands  of  documents,  and  talked  to  thousands  of 
consumers.  And  I  hear  the  conversations  I’ve  had  and  the  inter-
views I’ve done with them. 

And I think what you got at—but what most people don’t under-
stand—is  how  screwed  up  the  mortgage  marketplace  really  is.  It’s 
not  our  parent’s  marketplace.  It’s  not  our  grandparent’s  market-
place.  How  many  consumers  have  come  to  me  and  said,  ‘‘But  Ira, 
why would they give me a loan that I can’t afford? Don’t they make 
money when I pay my mortgage?’’ And the fact is, they don’t. 

And  when  we  see  that  type  of  advertising  out  there,  you  would 
think, that loan could not work. Why would a mortgage broker ad-
vertise  a  1.9  percent  mortgage,  when  in  fact,  they’re  not  going  to 
make any money, because it’s going to expect—the payments aren’t 
going  to  work  for  them?  Well,  the  payments  do  work  for  them,  be-
cause the system is broken, and the incentives are completely per-
verse. 

And what happened in the last number of years really is a prod-
uct  of  incredible  greed—just  incredible  greed—and  a  marketplace 
that  was  specifically  not  regulated.  The  FTC  shares  some  of  the 
blame, but the real blame goes to the Federal Reserve and the Of-
fice  of  the  Comptroller  of  the  Currency—I  cannot  echo  Attorney 
General  Blumenthal’s  remarks  any  further—they  are  a  culprit  in 
this beyond all imaginations. 

What  happened  was,  is  that  the  Wall  Street—it  reminds  me  of 
the  movie,  Little  Shop  of  Horrors.  You  had  this  plant,  ‘‘Feed  me, 
Seymour, feed me, Seymour.’’ And, sort of, everywhere it turned, it

44 

wanted  more  food,  more  loans,  and  more  product—regardless  of 
whether it was good for the plant, and it was regardless of whether 
it was the homeowners that were being fed. 

And  what  happened  in  the  marketplace  today,  was  that  home-
owners  were  not  consumers.  There  was  no  transaction  that  really 
existed  between  a  mortgage  lender  and  a  homeowner.  The  home-
owner was the product. The homeowner was a commodity that was 
being bought and sold to Wall Street, who could then slice and dice 
them,  and  then  sell  them.  And  unless  we  understand  that  funda-
mental  problem  in  the  marketplace  that  consumers  were  products 
to  be  sold,  as  opposed  to,  consumers  who  were  going  to  get  a  fair 
transaction, we’re not going to be able to solve this problem. 

One  point  that  you  made,  I  think,  is  so  very  important,  is  that 
there  are  good  players  in  the  mortgage  marketplace.  Not  as  many 
as  there  used  to  be.  And  I  think  part  of  it  is  what  we  saw  here 
today. 

I  look  at  appraisal  fraud  as  one  of  the,  sort  of,  systematic  of  the 
entire problem. Many appraisers are good people, and wanted to do 
the  right  thing,  and  price  things  appropriately.  Well,  guess  what? 
If  they  priced  things  appropriately,  they  got  no  business.  And  so, 
they  had  to  engage  in  the  same  practice—because  the  market  en-
couraged them to do that. 

It’s  the  same  thing.  That  small  corner  bank,  you  know,  in  Bis-
marck, who’s offering a loan at 6 percent and 6 and a half percent 
to  their  neighbor,  ‘‘Come  in,  we’ll  give  you  a  loan,  it’s  fair,  it’s  af-
fordable,  it  treats  you  right,  I  can  make  a  profit  on  it.’’  Well,  how 
do they compete against a company who’s offering a 2 percent loan? 
They can’t compete, and they fail. 

So,  the  regulation  that  we  need—we  need  the  market  economy 
to work appropriately. And the market economy can only work ap-
propriately,  and  the  good  actors  can  only  survive  in  this  market-
place  if  we  have  proper  regulation.  And  we  haven’t  had  it,  and  we 
need it desperately. 

The  Federal  Trade  Commission  is  the  one  place  in  our  Federal 
Government—the States have a key role—but the one place in our 
Federal  Government  that  has  consumer  protection  as  part  of  their 
mission. And they need to be expanded, and they need to be given 
more power and more ability to regulate this market. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF IRA J. RHEINGOLD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES 

Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  DeMint,  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee, 
thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  before  you  today  about  the  breakdown  of  the 
American  home  mortgage  market  and  its  impact  on  our  Nation’s  homeowners  and 
communities. 

My  name  is  Ira  Rheingold,  and  I  have  been  a  public  interest  attorney  for  my  en-
tire  adult  career.  I  have  worked  in  some  of  our  Nation’s  poorest  urban  and  rural 
communities  and  I’ve  witnessed  the  incredible  resilience  and  optimism  that  mark 
the  great  strength  of  our  Nation’s  people.  I  have  also  seen  the  incredible  fear  and 
despair of Americans faced with the loss of their long-term home and its devastating 
impact on their families and on their communities. 

In  the  mid-1990s  through  2001,  I  lived  and  worked  in  Chicago,  where  I  ran  the 
Legal  Assistance  Foundation’s  Homeownership  Preservation  Project.  During  those 
years,  I  watched  (and  worked  against)  the  unfair  and  deceptive  practices  of  all  the 
actors  in  the  mortgage  industry,  that  slowly,  but  inexorably  stripped  away  the

wealth  of  that  city’s  low  and  moderate  income  minority  communities.  Today,  I  am 
the  Executive  Director  of  the  National  Association  of  Consumer  Advocates  (NACA), 
an  organization  of  attorneys  and  other  advocates  who  represent  those  very  same 
consumers  and  communities  all  across  this  country.  At  NACA,  I  also  manage  the 
Institute for Foreclosure Legal Assistance, a project that provides funding and train-
ing to non-profit legal organizations that help homeowners negotiate alternatives to 
foreclosure.  In  my  current  roles,  I  speak  to  and  assist  our  Nation’s  consumer  advo-
cates  who,  on  a  daily  basis,  meet  with  and  represent  the  consumers  victimized  by 
bad  lending  practices  and  see  the  very  real-life  consequences  of  an  out  of  control 
mortgage  lending  marketplace.  What  I  see  from  them  are  the  same  unfair  and  de-
ceptive practices that I personally witnessed in Chicago, except now, those behaviors 
have  moved  across  all  of  our  Nation’s  communities.  What  I  hear  from  their  clients 
is  the  same  fear  and  despair  that  I  heard  all  too  often  on  the  streets  of  Chicago. 
At today’s hearing, I hope that you will hear their voices through me, and that you 
will  begin  to  see  what  we  all  need  to  do  to  build  a  rational,  robust  and  well-regu-
lated  mortgage  market  that  actually  serves  the  needs  and  demands  of  consumers 
and communities across our Nation. 
Introduction 

To  understand  what  it  has  been  like  to  be  a  consumer  attempting  to  buy  their 
first home, a homeowner attempting to refinance their home for necessary home re-
pairs or to help pay for their children’s education or to lower their payment so they 
could  remain  in  their  life-long  home  on  a  fixed  income,  we  must  first  understand 
how the mortgage market has been working. The mortgage market of the late 1990s 
and early 21st century, in no way resembled what most of us thought we understood 
about  buying  a  home  or  getting  a  loan.  I  have  talked  to  literally  thousands  of  con-
sumers, who, until recently, believed (or were led to believe) that the mortgage enti-
ty that originated their loan, would only profit when they timely made their month-
ly mortgage payment. While this may have been the case when our parents or even 
our grandparents bought their homes, this has not remotely been the truth for more 
than  the  past  dozen  years.  Instead,  because  of  the  growth  of  securitization  as  the 
tool to fund both prime and subprime mortgages, with all its confusing layers, mul-
tiple  actors  and  often  perverse  incentives,  the  nature  of  the  consumer-mortgage 
originator relationship (unbeknownst to the consumer) had fundamentally changed. 
These  changed  relationships  and  backward  incentives  have  led  us  to  the  precipice 
that we stand at today. 
Securitization and the Consumer 

For my purpose today, I’m going to keep this very simple.1 At its most basic level, 
securitization  is  a  process,  which  involves  the  pooling  and  repackaging  of  cash-flow 
producing  financial  assets  into  securities  that  are  then  sold  to  investors.  As 
securitization  grew  to  be  the  dominant  way  that  mortgage  loans  were  funded,  the 
role  and  purpose  of  mortgage  originators  (and  all  the  other  actors  in  the  mortgage 
market)  fundamentally  changed.  No  longer  were  mortgage  originators,  ‘‘lenders’’ 
who  expected  (or  really  cared)  about  mortgage  repayments.  Instead,  these  origina-
tors  became  manufacturers  of  a  commodity,  the  American  mortgage  borrower  (un-
fortunately, most homeowners did not and don’t understand their role in this trans-
action).  This  commodity  was  then  sold  to  the  capital  markets,  which  in  turn, 
chopped,  spindled  and  mutated  this  new  commodity  into  something  that  could  be 
purchased by investors from around the world. 

While  advocates  of  securitization  have  argued  that  the  process  produced  addi-
tional  capital  and  greater  access  to  homeownership  for  some  consumers,  they  fail 
to recognize the fundamental shift and potential dangers it created in the consumer 
marketplace.  No  longer  was  the  borrower’s  best  interest  (or  even  their  ability  to 
repay the loan) part of the mortgage transaction calculation. Instead, the real trans-
action  was  between  the  mortgage  originator  and  the  investment  bank,  which  not 
only  set  the  standards  for  the  borrower/product  they  wanted  to  buy  (and  then  turn 
around and sell), but also provided the money for the originators’ loans. 

Under these set of circumstances, what American consumers needed was the vig-
orous  enforcement  of  existing  consumer  protections  as  well  a  new  set  of  consumer 
protections to correspond with the very different mortgage world that had now been 
created.  Unfortunately,  what  the  Federal  Government  gave  us  was  the  exact  oppo-
site,  not  only  diminishing  its  regulation  and  enforcement  of  this  market,  but  pro-
viding  interference  and  protection  (under  the  guise  of  preemption)  for  mortgage

market  players  when  states,  recognizing  the  fundamental  flaws  in  the  system,  at-
tempted to protect their own citizens. 
The Mortgage Market, Unfairness, Deception and the Consumer 

Understanding  what  mortgage  originators  (and  all  of  the  actors  in  the  process) 
were  attempting  to  do,  i.e.,  create  commodities  to  sell,  when  they  made  a  loan  to 
consumer helps us understand all the unfair and deceptive practices that have flour-
ished in the mortgage marketplace over the last decade. I’d like to talk about some 
of those practices now, and explain why they were not caused by a few rogue actors, 
but  were  instead  a  product  of  the  fundamentally  flawed  marketplace  that 
securitization  created  and  the  Federal  Government  passively  permitted  to  flourish. 
A. The Predatory Pitch 

As  the  demand  for  product  to  sell  to  Wall  Street  investment  banks  grew  (ulti-
mately  exponentially),  the  pitch  to  vulnerable  homeowners  (and  prospective  home-
owners)  became  more  targeted  and  more  personal.  Armed  with  financial  and  per-
sonal  data  and  carefully  conducted  research,  mortgage  brokers  and  lenders  (and 
their ‘‘bird dogs’’) used TV and radio advertising, mailings, telephone calls, and even 
home  visits  to  reel  in  consumers  who  otherwise  had  no  real  reason  to  get  a  new 
home  mortgage.  With  promises  too  good  to  be  true  (‘‘refinance  your  home,  fix  your 
roof  and  lower  your  monthly  payment’’)  consumers  were  later  bait  and  switched  to 
loans far more expensive than they thought they were promised. Because the mort-
gage  ‘‘originators’’  received  their  full  compensation  when  they  manufactured  the 
‘‘product/borrower’’ to sell onward and upward, there was little concern whether the 
loan was sustainable. As many of us knew, and most of us have now learned, many 
of those loans were completely unsustainable. 
B. The Over-Inflated Appraisal 

In  a  rational  world,  a  consumer  would  not  want  to  pay  (or  borrow)  more  for  a 
home  than  what  it  was  worth.  In  the  securitization  created  ‘‘bizarro’’  mortgage 
world,  an  over-inflated  house  made  perfect  sense  to  the  parties  involved  in  the 
transaction  (except  for  the  unsuspecting  consumer,  of  course,  and  maybe  the  ulti-
mate investors left holding the bag). Let’s look at the parties to the transaction. We 
have  the  mortgage  originator  (the  broker  or  the  lender  or  sometimes  both)  whose 
incentive  is  quite  obvious.  Simply  put,  the  greater  the  house  price,  the  larger  the 
loan,  the  greater  the  fee  they  will  receive  from  the  transaction.  (The  same  can  be 
said  for  the  investment  bank).  Sometimes  the  incentives  are  a  little  more  com-
plicated.  Take  for  instance  a  homeowner  whose  existing  mortgage  is  already  100 
percent  of  the  actual  value  of  the  home.  If  the  real  house  value  was  used,  no  loan 
could be made, no product could be created. So the house value is increased to meet 
the loan purchasing parameters (the underwriting guidelines) set by the investment 
bank and the loan gets made and everyone is happy (including the ‘‘unknowing’’ in-
vestment bank who has another product to slice and dice and sell to someone else). 
As  for  the  appraiser  who  creates  the  fraudulent  value  for  the  home,  we’ve  seen 
time  and  again  why  they  go  along  with  this  fraud.  Simply,  if  they  actually  want 
to  stay  in  business  and  continuing  doing  appraisals,  they’ll  create  the  value  the 
mortgage originator wants. 

What  we  have  left,  is  a  consumer  who  has  a  mortgage  that  is  too  often  worth 

more than the real value of their home. 
C. Yield Spread Premiums and Prepayment Penalties 

Unfortunately  (for  me),  I  have  been  around  long  enough  to  hear  multiple  and 
ever-shifting explanations as to why yield-spread premiums (ysps) are an acceptable 
practice and why they can work for consumers. I can safely state, that none of those 
arguments are true in the mortgage marketplace that actually exists in our country. 
I do however, fully understand why they work for every mortgage market actor ex-
cept, again—of course—for the consumer. 

Let’s  see.  Mortgage  brokers  get  paid  more  if  they  produce  mortgages  with  an  in-
terest rate higher than what a borrower qualifies for (that, in short is a ‘‘ysp’’). Un-
less a mortgage broker actual lives up to their off-stated (but never written) commit-
ment to serve in the best interest of their consumer client, their incentive—a bigger 
paycheck—to  produce  a  loan  with  a  ysp  is  clear.  Same  with  the  mortgage  lender 
and investment bank, who now have a loan with a bigger interest rate to sell. 

To make matters worse, almost any loan with a ysp is sure to have a prepayment 
penalty.  In  English,  a  prepayment  penalty  is  a  charge  to  a  consumer  who  repays 
their  loan  ‘‘too  soon,’’  typically  during  the  first  few  years  of  the  loan’s  existence. 
What  makes  this  product  so  cynical,  and  so  closely  intertwined  with  a  ysp,  is  that 
the  very  existence  of  the  ysp  means  that  the  consumer  has  an  interest  rate  that 
is  higher  than  they  actually  qualify  for.  Therefore,  if  the  consumer  acts  rationally

and  shops  for  a  lower  interest  and  enters  into  a  new  mortgage,  they  will  be  pun-
ished with a steep prepayment penalty. 

In  all  my  years  talking,  interviewing,  and  representing  consumers,  I  have  yet  to 
meet  that  one  consumer  who  actually  understood  that  they  were  charged  a  ysp  or 
that  the  ysp  led  to  a  higher  interest  rate  than  they  were  otherwise  qualified  for. 
I  simply  can’t  imagine  how  this  practice  is  not  deceptive  or  just  plain  unfair.  Yet 
none of our Nation’s Federal regulators have ever really done anything about it (ex-
cept to find ways to allow its widespread use). 
D. The Disappearance of Escrow Accounts 

Because  the  borrower  has  become  the  product  to  be  created  and  sold,  mortgage 
originators  have  become  experts  at  getting  borrowers  to  take  out  loans  that  make 
little or no economic sense. A classic and pervasive practice in the mortgage market 
is  the  ‘‘promise’’  that  a  new  loan  will  allow  the  borrower  to  pay  a  lower  monthly 
mortgage  payment.  What  the  borrower  is  not  told  is  that  their  new  payment  does 
not include their taxes and insurance (for escrow), so that their lower payment real-
ly  is  just  a  mathematical  fiction  (otherwise  known  as  a  lie).  While  the  Federal  Re-
serve now finally appears ready to take some action on this practice, it is ridiculous 
that  this  blatantly  unfair  and  deceptive  practice  (which  had  been  standard  oper-
ating  practice  in  the  mortgage  marketplace  for  over  a  decade),  had  never  been  out-
lawed or prosecuted by our Federal regulators. 
E.  Reckless  Underwriting  and  the  Rise  of  Community  Endangering  Loan  Products 
In  place  of  an  efficient  market  that  provides  real  consumer  choice  and  rewards 
consumers  for  smart  credit  decisions  and  rational  aspirations,  we  have  seen,  in  the 
past few years, a mortgage market that has recklessly created and sold ridiculously 
risky  mortgage  products  that  have  excessively  benefited  all  of  the  market  players 
at  the  expense  of  the  American  consumer  and  our  Nation’s  communities.  In  a  ra-
tional  marketplace  these  loans  make  no  sense.  Looking  at  them  however  through 
the  lens  of  our  fundamentally  flawed  and  unregulated  mortgage  marketplace,  they 
unfortunately made perfect sense (at least at the time they were made). 

Simply  put,  in  order  to  meet  the  product  demand  of  voracious  Wall  Street  inves-
tors,  originators  ignored  basic,  common-sense  underwriting  principles  in  order  to 
boost  their  loan  volume.  No  doc  or  ‘‘stated-income’’  loans  were  great  because  loan 
originators  made  more  money  (it  was  less  work  and  they  could  charge  borrowers  a 
higher  interest  rate)  and  they  fed  the  beast  that  wanted  high-risk  products  that 
would  produce  a  higher  return  for  investors.  Underwriting  adjustable  rate  mort-
gages  only  at  the  initial  interest  rate,  without  considering  how  homeowners  would 
be able to pay their loans once the payment adjusted upward, was also quite profit-
able  for  mortgage  originators  and  the  investment  banks  that  were  fed  by  them. 
These fundamentally unsustainable loan products, in all their derivations (including 
2–28s  and  option  ARMs)  were  destined  for  failure  and  failed  they  have  and  we’re 
all now living with the consequences. 

But  it  didn’t  have  to  be  this  way.  Many  of  us  saw  the  current  disaster  coming, 
but  our  voices  were  ignored.  This  administration,  its  Federal  regulators  and  this 
Congress could have chosen to protect consumers, but instead it sat on the sidelines 
as our mortgage market came to a predictable crash. My only hope is that we have 
all  learned  the  right  lessons  from  this  current  and  ongoing  crisis,  and  we  move  to-
gether  to  build  a  well-regulated  mortgage  market  that  meets  the  needs  of  all  our 
Nation’s homeowners. 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Rheingold, thank you very much. 
Finally,  we  will  hear  from  Mr.  Bill  Himpler,  Executive  Vice 
President of Federal Affairs, the American Financial Services Asso-
ciation. 

Mr. Himpler, welcome. 

STATEMENT OF BILL HIMPLER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, 
FEDERAL  AFFAIRS,  AMERICAN  FINANCIAL  SERVICES 
ASSOCIATION 
Mr. HIMPLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you having 
this  important  hearing  today,  and  giving  AFSA  the  opportunity  to 
testify.  While  the  scope  of  mortgage-related  issues  in  the  current 
environment is immense, my testimony will focus on the FTC’s role 
in helping to restore confidence in housing in the mortgage sectors.

Let  me  state  at  the  outset,  that  AFSA  member  companies  share 
your  concern—and  all  of  my  fellow  panelists’  concerns—about  the 
growing  number  of  homeowners  who  are  having  difficulty  making 
their  mortgage  payments.  We  ask  the  Subcommittee  to  consider 
four key points. 

First,  the  voluntary  nature  of  the  partnership  efforts  between 

lenders and distressed homeowners is very important. 

Second,  to  maintain  liquidity,  policymakers  and  regulators  must 
avoid  imposing  new  mandates  and  policies  for  mortgage  lending 
that would create uncertainty for investors. 

Third,  enhancing  consumer  understanding  of  mortgage  products 
through educational programs is crucial, and the FTC has been an 
indispensable partner in this. 

And  finally,  limited  Federal  resources  should  be  focused  to  en-
courage at-risk borrowers to contact their lenders to learn what as-
sistant is available to them. 

While  relief  for  borrowers  whose  adjustable  rate  mortgages  are 
about  to  reset,  cannot  come  fast  enough,  the  right  way  to  proceed, 
and provide relief is through outreach campaigns that are currently 
underway. 

Our  Association  is  a  founding  partner  of  the  HOPE  NOW  Alli-
ance, which has provided loan workouts, for approximately 1.4 mil-
lion  homeowners  since  July  of  last  year.  During  the  first  quarter 
of  this  year,  loan  modifications  represented  44  percent  of  all 
subprime workouts, which is double the rate of last year. 

Furthermore,  the  Federal  financial  regulators  have  provided 
great  consumer  protection  in  the  mortgage  arena.  The  regulators 
have strongly encouraged lenders to limit the use of balloon terms, 
and  pre-payment  penalties  on  adjustable  rate  mortgage  products, 
and called for increased use of escrow accounts in relation to these 
products. 

In  addition  to  cutting  rates,  the  Federal  Reserve  is  expected  to 
publish  a  final  rule  in  the  next  2  months,  exercising  its  authority 
to  ban  unfair  and  deceptive  practices  by  mortgage  lenders.  HUD 
has  proposed  a  significant  re-write  of  its  RESPA  regulations. 
What’s more, States have become more and more aware of the need 
for more stringent regulation, particularly with respect to mortgage 
brokers.  Thus,  whether  at  the  Federal  level  or  at  the  State  level, 
government is acting to address problematic conduct. 

Let me turn briefly to the FTC. AFSA believes that the FTC has 
been  successful  in  enhancing  consumer  protection,  and  has  ad-
dressed the subprime mortgage crisis in at least two ways. 

The first, by using its enforcement authority, under the FTC Act, 
to pursue bad actors in the subprime mortgage industry. For exam-
ple,  the  FTC  successfully  negotiated  a  $40  million  settlement  with 
Select Portfolio Services, after the Agency alleged that Select Port-
folio  engaged  in  unfair  and  deceptive  practices  in  servicing 
subprime mortgage loans. 

The FTC also entered into a $65 million settlement with First Al-

liance Mortgage, for making deceptive mortgage loans. 

The  second  way  in  which  the  FTC  has  helped  to  alleviate  the 
mortgage crisis, is by issuing guidance, and submitting public com-
ments  to  the  Federal  banking  agencies.  In  June  of  last  year,  the 
FTC released a Staff Report on Improving Consumer Mortgage Dis-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:23 Jul 31, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75345.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

closures.  The  report  concluded  that  improved  disclosures  would 
help  consumers  better  understand  their  loan  terms  and  costs,  and 
that  consumer  testing  is  an  imperative  part  of  developing  effective 
disclosures. 

AFSA believes that the FTC has been effective in enhancing con-
sumer  understanding  of  the  mortgage  process,  and  protecting  the 
public  against  bad  actors.  However,  we  also  believe  that  some  of 
the  provisions  in  the  reauthorization  act  will  have  the  unintended 
consequence  of  reducing  investor  confidence,  which  will  ultimately 
make credit less affordable for consumers. 

In  particular,  Section  5  would  expand  the  Commission’s  author-
ity to seek civil penalties for violations of the FTC Act, without any 
prior rule or order by an agency. As a result, a defendant could face 
civil penalties of as much as $11,000 per violation, based on an act 
or practice that is adjudicated to be unfair or deceptive for the first 
time against that very defendant, in that very lawsuit. 

The  bill  would  eliminate  the  current  requirement  that  the  FTC 
involve  of  the  Department  of  Justice  when  the  Commission  seeks 
to  enforce  violations  of  the  FTC’s  rules,  or  cease  and  desist  orders 
in U.S. District Court. 

However,  if  a  company  were  to  face  the  prospect  of  substantial 
penalties  on  an  act  or  practice  that’s  never  previously  been  deter-
mined by any court or agency to be unfair or deceptive, then review 
an  input  by  DOJ,  would  ensure  that  the  act  or  practice  warranted 
prosecution for civil penalties rather than less draconian relief. 

Section  8  would  allow  the  agency—by  a  majority  vote  of  the  full 
Commission—to  promulgate  rules  on  any  consumer  protections 
matter, under expedited rules of the Administrative Procedure Act, 
rather  than  under  the  procedures  of  the  longstanding  Magnuson- 
Moss Act. The expedited rulemaking authority could lead to a seri-
ous  rush  to  judgment,  allowing  the  FTC  to  create  major  industry- 
wide regulatory changes, without adequate time for business input. 
Section  9  of  the  bill  would  require  the  FTC  to  promulgate  an 
APA  rule  for  subprime  mortgage  and  non-traditional  mortgage 
loans,  yet  provides  no  specificity  or  guidance  as  to  the  substance 
or scope of such rule. This provision is an abdication of the respon-
sibilities of Congress to consider and enact such legislation as may 
be necessary and appropriate in these areas. 

Under  Section  11,  the  bill  would  give  new  powers  to  the  State 
Attorneys General, including the authority to enforce a violation of 
whatever  rule  the  FTC  would  promulgate  for  subprime  mortgage 
and non-traditional mortgage loans. Currently, State Attorney Gen-
eral  enforcement  of  Federal  law  is  limited  to  specific  acts  of  Con-
gress.  Their  enforcement  actions,  involving  unfair  and  deceptive 
acts  and  practices,  are  limited  to  the  State  laws  affecting  the  citi-
zens of that State. 

If Congress were to give the State Attorneys General the author-
ity to enforce Federal rules and statutes, this could result in dupli-
cative  and  inconsistent  laws  based  on  the  same  conduct—in  other 
words,  we  could  end  up  with  50  different  interpretations  of  the 
same  Federal  law.  It  is  unnecessary  to  give  this  new  power  to  the 
State Attorneys General, as they regularly join with the FTC in en-
forcement actions and settlements.

While  we  appreciate  all  the  Government  has  done  so  far  to  ad-
dress  the  mortgage  situation,  more  can  be  done.  We  need  help  in 
reaching as many homeowners as possible about the importance of 
contacting  their  lenders,  if  they’re  struggling  to  make  their  mort-
gage payment. Far too many homeowners have not taken this step, 
often  because  of  ignorance,  fear,  or  a  combination  of  the  two.  Yet, 
the  sooner  these  borrowers  contact  their  lenders,  the  better  their 
chances of finding a workable solution. 

Again,  AFSA  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  you, 
Mr. Chairman, and I’d be happy to answer any questions you may 
have. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Himpler follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF BILL HIMPLER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, 

FEDERAL AFFAIRS, AMERICAN FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION 

My  name  is  Bill  Himpler,  and  I  am  the  Executive  Vice  President  for  Federal  Af-
fairs at the American Financial Services Association (‘‘AFSA’’). AFSA is the national 
trade  association  for  the  consumer  credit  industry,  protecting  access  to  credit  and 
consumer  choice.  The  association  encourages  and  maintains  ethical  business  prac-
tices and supports financial education for consumers of all ages. AFSA has provided 
services  to  its  members  for  over  90  years.  AFSA’s  350  member  companies  include 
consumer  and  commercial  finance  companies,  ‘‘captive’’  auto  finance  companies, 
credit  card  issuers,  mortgage  lenders,  industrial  banks,  and  other  financial  service 
firms that lend to consumers and small businesses. 

AFSA  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  provide  testimony  to  the  Members  of  the 
Subcommittee  on  the  state  of  the  mortgage  market,  efforts  by  industry  to  partner 
with government agencies and consumer counselors to provide mortgage security to 
at-risk  borrowers,  and  our  members’  perspective  on  policy  recommendations  cur-
rently  before  Congress.  As  the  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  know,  the  scope  of 
mortgage-related  issues  in  the  current  environment  is  immense.  Today,  however,  I 
will  focus  my  testimony  on  the  role  that  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  has  played 
and  can  continue  to  play  in  helping  to  restore  confidence  in  the  housing  and  mort-
gage sectors. 

Let me state at the outset that AFSA members share Congress’ concern about the 
growing  number  of  homeowners  who  are  having  difficulty  making  their  mortgage 
payments.  Not  only  do  foreclosures  affect  individual  borrowers  and  their  commu-
nities, they also affect mortgage lenders, which lose approximately $40,000 per fore-
closure. 

AFSA  asks  the  Subcommittee  to  consider  several  key  points.  First,  I  would  like 
to  emphasize  the  importance  of  the  voluntary  nature  of  the  partnership  efforts  be-
tween lenders and consumers who face financial difficulty but want to stay in their 
homes. 

Liquidity is equally important in today’s tightened credit market. To maintain li-
quidity, it is imperative that policymakers and regulators avoid imposing new man-
dates and policies for mortgage lending that would create uncertainty for investors. 
Enhancing  consumer  understanding  of  mortgage  products  through  personal  fi-
nance education programs is crucial and the FTC has been an indispensable partner 
in this effort. 

Finally,  AFSA  believes  that  limited  Federal  resources  should  be  used  to  buttress 
public  and  private  efforts  to  encourage  at-risk  borrowers  to  contact  their  lenders  to 
learn what assistance is available to them. 
Voluntary Foreclosure Prevention Programs 

While relief for borrowers whose adjustable rate mortgages are about to reset can-
not come fast enough, AFSA believes the right way to provide this relief is through 
the  outreach  campaigns  that  are  currently  underway.  A  paper  that  describes  ongo-
ing foreclosure mitigation efforts is attached to this testimony. 

AFSA  is  a  founding  partner  of  the  HOPE  NOW  Alliance  that  was  launched  last 
October  at  the  behest  of  Treasury  Secretary  Paulson  and  HUD  Secretary  Jackson 
as  a  coordinated  outreach  program  utilizing  the  resources  of  the  lending  industry 
and  the  credit  counseling  community.  The  HOPE  NOW  plan  is  designed  to  help 
subprime borrowers who can at least afford the current, starter rate on a subprime 
loan,  but  will  not  be  able  to  make  the  higher  payments  once  the  interest  rate  goes 
up.  HOPE  NOW  members  have  agreed  on  a  set  of  new  industry-wide  standards  to 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:23 Jul 31, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75345.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

provide systematic relief to these borrowers in one of three ways: (1) refinancing an 
existing  loan  into  a  new  private  mortgage;  (2)  moving  them  into  an  FHA  Secure 
loan; or (3) freezing their current interest rates for 5 years. 

Fourteen  HOPE  NOW  servicers,  responsible  for  more  than  33.3  million  home 
loans,  or  about  62  percent  of  both  prime  and  subprime  loans  outstanding  nation-
wide,  reported  that  they  provided  loan  workouts  for  about  1,376,000  homeowners 
since  July  2007.  Of  the  502,500  prime  and  subprime  loan  workouts  that  servicers 
provided  to  homeowners  during  the  first  quarter  of  2008,  approximately  323,000 
were repayment plans and 179,500 were loan modifications. During the first quarter 
of  2008  loan  modifications  represented  44  percent  of  all  subprime  loan  workouts, 
which is double the 2007 rate. 

In  addition  to  HOPE  NOW,  six  major  lenders  announced  the  launch  of  Project 
Lifeline  earlier  this  month.  These  servicers  will  begin  the  program  by  providing  a 
letter to seriously delinquent homeowners nationwide. The letter gives homeowners 
a  simple  step-by-step  approach  that,  if  followed,  may  enable  them  to  ‘‘pause’’  their 
foreclosure  for  30  days  while  a  potential  loan  modification  is  evaluated.  The  ulti-
mate goal of this step-by-step approach is to find a solution which meets the individ-
ual’s needs. This is different than the streamlined approach to loan modification an-
nounced previously. Subprime, Alt-A, and prime loans may qualify for this program, 
including second liens and home equity loans. 
Current Federal and State Regulatory and Legislative Activity 

Furthermore,  I  call  your  attention  to  the  activity  by  the  Federal  financial  regu-
lators to provide greater consumer protection in the mortgage arena. The regulators 
have  provided  guidance  to  strongly  encourage  lenders  to  limit  the  use  of  balloon 
terms  and  prepayment  penalties  on  adjustable-rate  mortgage  products,  and  called 
for  the  increased  use  of  escrows  in  relation  to  these  products.  In  response  to  calls 
from  Congress  to  address  current  mortgage  market  conditions,  the  Federal  Reserve 
Board  is  expected  to  publish  a  final  rule  in  the  next  2  months  in  which  it  will,  for 
the  first  time,  exercise  its  authority  to  ban  unfair  and  deceptive  practices  by  mort-
gage lenders. In its new rule, the Federal Reserve Board is also expected to use its 
regulatory  authority  over  mortgage  lenders  to  police  the  activities  of  mortgage  bro-
kers.  Moreover,  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  has  proposed 
a  significant  overhaul  to  regulations  under  the  Real  Estate  Settlement  Procedures 
Act  with  an  eye  toward  greater  consumer  understanding  of  the  mortgage  process 
and clearer disclosure of consumer obligations associated with adjustable rate mort-
gages. 

Congress, as well, is considering legislation that would promote consumer protec-
tion  in  the  mortgage  markets,  forestall  future  abuses  and  instill  consumer  con-
fidence  back  into  the  marketplace.  In  addition  to  the  housing  stimulus  package 
passed  by  the  Senate  earlier  this  month  and  being  considered  in  the  House  as  we 
speak,  the  House  has  already  passed  the  Mortgage  Reform  and  Anti-Predatory 
Lending  Act  of  2007,  H.R.  3915  and  the  Senate  Banking  Committee  is  poised  to 
markup the Home Ownership Preservation and Protection Act of 2007, S. 2452 that 
will address the specific abuses that led us into the current crisis. 

States  have  also  been  active  on  both  the  legislative  and  regulatory  fronts.  States 
have  become  aware  of  the  need  for  more  stringent  regulation,  particularly  with  re-
spect  to  mortgage  brokers,  which  have  received  little  attention  by  Federal  regu-
lators. These state legislative and regulatory initiatives appropriately target specific 
practices  that  are  perceived  as  abusive.  This  type  of  regulation  both  puts  the  re-
sponsible  mortgage  lenders  and  brokers  on  notice  of  the  practices  that  they  must 
avoid  and  also  provides  direction  to  the  secondary  market  investors  who  want  to 
avoid  purchasing  loans  from  or  investing  in  companies  that  fail  to  live  up  to  clear 
legislative or regulatory mandates. The state legislation also has, for the most part, 
provided  measured  penalties  for  violations  of  the  acts  and  practices  that  have  been 
identified as inappropriate. 

Thus, whether at the Federal or the state level, we perceive government as appro-
priately  addressing  problematic  conduct  going  forward.  Legislative  committees  and 
regulatory  bodies  have  studied  the  actions  that  have  led  to  the  current  crisis 
through  public  hearings  and  investigations.  Unacceptable  acts  and  practices  have 
been  identified  as  such  and  have  been  appropriately  prohibited  or  restricted.  The 
result is a developing framework of Federal and state rules that provide clear guid-
ance and assess appropriate penalties if one nevertheless chooses to engage in such 
activities. 
Market Liquidity 

Market  liquidity  is  the  key  to  lenders’  ability  to  provide  affordable  credit  to  con-
sumers.  When  credit  is  tight,  the  interest  rates  that  lenders  can  offer  consumers 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:23 Jul 31, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75345.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

rise. After the credit crisis last August, many borrowers with less-than-perfect credit 
found  getting  a  mortgage  loan  extremely  difficult.  However,  the  Federal  Reserve 
Board’s  recent  rate  cuts  have  improved  liquidity  and  made  credit  more  affordable. 
Market liquidity should continue to improve and help abate the current housing cri-
sis  provided  that  lenders  and  investors  can  be  assured  of  which  acts  and  practices 
are prohibited. 
FTC: Effective Regulator 

The FTC has been very successful in addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and 
enhancing consumer protection under its current authority. The FTC has addressed 
this  crisis  in  two  ways:  first,  by  using  its  enforcement  authority  under  Section  5  of 
the  FTC  Act  to  pursue  bad  actors  in  the  subprime  mortgage  industry,  and  second, 
by  setting  Federal  policy  through  guidance  and  public  comment.  The  FTC  success-
fully  negotiated  a  $40  million  settlement  with  Select  Portfolio  Services  (formerly 
known as Fairbanks Capital Corporation) in November 2003. The FTC alleged that 
Select  Portfolio  engaged  in  unfair  and  deceptive  practices  in  servicing  subprime 
mortgage  loans.  Under  the  terms  of  the  settlement,  Select  Portfolio  agreed  to  pay 
$40 million, which the FTC in turn distributed to consumers as redress. The settle-
ment  was  modified  in  August  2007  to  provide  additional  protections  to  borrowers, 
including  mandatory  monthly  mortgage  statements,  a  five-year  prohibition  on  mar-
keting optional products such as home warranties, and refunds for foreclosure attor-
ney  fees  for  services  that  were  not  actually  performed.  The  FTC  also  entered  into 
a  $65  million  settlement  with  First  Alliance  Mortgage  Company  for  making  decep-
tive  subprime  mortgage  loans.  The  FTC  alleged  that  First  Alliance  misrepresented 
the  existence  and  amount  of  origination  fees  and  increases  in  interest  rates  and 
monthly  payments  on  adjustable  rate  loans.  The  settlement  included  payment  not 
only by First Alliance, but also by Brian and Sarah Chisick, the founders and own-
ers  of  First  Alliance.  The  FTC  distributed  the  $65  million  to  nearly  20,000  affected 
borrowers.  These  are  just  two  examples  of  successful  FTC  enforcement  actions  con-
cerning  subprime  mortgage  lending.  The  FTC  has  successfully  pursued  other 
subprime  mortgage  lenders  engaged  in  what  the  FTC  deemed  to  be  inappropriate 
conduct, including Capital City Mortgage Corporation and Quicken Loans, Inc. 

In  addition  to  pursuing  bad  actors  in  the  subprime  mortgage  industry,  the  FTC 
has helped to alleviate the subprime mortgage crisis and improve mortgage lending 
practices by issuing guidance and submitting public comments to the Federal bank-
ing agencies. In June 2007, the FTC released a Staff Report on Improving Consumer 
Mortgage  Disclosures.  The  FTC  conducted  a  study  on  the  effectiveness  of  mortgage 
loan disclosures and found that current disclosures do not adequately explain mort-
gage  loan  terms  and  costs  to  consumers.  The  FTC  concluded  that  improved  mort-
gage  loan  disclosures  would  help  consumers  to  better  understand  their  loan  terms 
and  costs,  and  that  consumer  testing  is  imperative  in  developing  effective  disclo-
sures.  The  FTC  has  also  submitted  public  comments  to  the  Federal  banking  agen-
cies  on  numerous  occasions,  setting  forth  the  FTC’s  position  on  various  issues.  For 
instance, on the issue of mortgage disclosures, the FTC submitted comments to the 
Federal  banking  agencies  in  response  to  their  Proposed  Illustrations  for  Consumer 
Information  for  Subprime  Mortgage  Lending.  The  FTC  commented  that  consumers 
would  benefit  from  a  single  disclosure  that  consolidates  the  disclosure  of  important 
features and costs of a mortgage loan. Additionally, based on its own mortgage dis-
closure research, the FTC encouraged the Federal banking agencies to conduct con-
sumer research to ensure that the proposed disclosures would be effective. 

In  sum,  the  FTC  has  successfully  addressed  and  helped  to  curtail  abuses  in  the 
subprime  mortgage  industry  through  its  current  enforcement  authority  and  its  role 
in developing Federal policy. 
FTC Reauthorization Act of 2008 

As  I  noted  above,  AFSA  believes  that  the  FTC  has  been  effective  in  enhancing 
consumer  understanding  of  the  mortgage  process  and  protecting  the  public  against 
bad  actors.  Moreover,  we  have  been  proud  to  partner  with  the  FTC  on  a  number 
of these efforts. However, AFSA believes that some of the provisions in the FTC Re-
authorization Act of 2008 will have the unintended consequence of reducing investor 
confidence,  which  ultimately  will  make  credit  less  affordable.  I  would  like  to  take 
a moment to explain our principal concerns. 
Section 5. Civil Penalties for Violations of the FTC Act 

This  section  would  expand  the  Commission’s  authority  to  seek  in  U.S.  District 
Court civil penalties for violations of the FTC Act, and it would give the FTC power 
to  seek  these  penalties  without  any  prior  rule  or  order  by  the  agency.  As  a  result, 
a defendant could face civil penalties of as much as $11,000 per violation, based on

an  act  or  practice  that  is  adjudicated  to  be  unfair  or  deceptive  for  the  first  time  in 
the lawsuit against the defendant. 

Today,  in  court  actions  involving  initial  determinations  that  a  particular  practice 
is unfair or deceptive, the FTC is limited to injunctive and monetary relief and the 
equitable powers of a court to redress demonstrated consumer injury. Civil penalties 
are  reserved  for  violations  of  a  rule  or  a  final  cease  and  desist  order  with  actual 
knowledge or knowledge fairly implied that the act or practice is unfair or deceptive 
and is prohibited by the rule or is unlawful under the FTC Act. Thus, civil penalties 
essentially punish a defendant for a law violation when the FTC can prove that the 
defendant knew that the practice was not only unfair or deceptive but was also pro-
hibited by an exiting rule or order. 

Given  the  Commission’s  very  broad  mandate  to  address  ‘‘unfair  or  deceptive  acts 
or  practices,’’  no  company  should  face  the  prospect  of  civil  penalties  for  an  act  or 
practice until there has been a prior determination that the act or practice is unfair 
or deceptive and the company has had actual knowledge of that determination. That 
is  why  FTC  civil  penalty  actions  in  U.S.  District  Court  under  Section  5  of  the  FTC 
Act are reserved for violations of rules or cease and desist orders. This process pro-
vides  appropriate  notice,  not  only  to  the  target  of  the  FTC  enforcement  action,  but 
to  the  industry  as  a  whole,  and  lets  market  participants  reform  their  practices  be-
fore facing crippling fines and penalties. 

The  requirement  of  knowledge  that  an  act  or  practice  is  ‘‘unfair  or  deceptive’’  is 
based on the fact that these terms are very broad, susceptible to differing interpre-
tations  and  applied  to  many  different  industries.  ‘‘Unfairness’’  is  a  particularly 
evolving  standard,  in  both  the  FTC’s  interpretation  and  its  use  in  enforcement  ac-
tions.  For  example,  the  FTC  has  applied  the  unfairness  standard  in  settlements 
against  holders  of  credit  card  data  that  suffered  security  breaches.  In  settlements 
with  BJ’s  Wholesale  Club,  Inc.,  Life  is  good,  Inc.,  and  TJX,  the  FTC  alleged  that 
the  failure  of  these  retailers  to  adequately  safeguard  customers’  personal  informa-
tion,  which  ultimately  led  to  security  breaches,  constituted  unfair  practices  under 
Section  5.  These  settlements  resulted  in  orders  requiring  the  retailers  to  develop 
and  maintain  adequate  security  information  programs  and  safeguarding  practices. 
Had the FTC been empowered to seek civil penalties of up to $11,000 for each viola-
tion in these cases, the settlements could have had a crippling effect. 
Section 3. Independent Litigation Authority 

The  bill  would  eliminate  the  current  requirement  that  the  FTC  involve  the  De-
partment of Justice (DOJ) when the Commission seeks to enforce violations of FTC 
trade  regulation  rules  or  cease  and  desist  orders  in  U.S.  District  Court.  As  noted 
above,  violations  of  those  rules  or  orders  may  result  in  the  defendant  paying  civil 
penalties to the government. In addition, when the FTC seeks civil penalties under 
statutes  such  as  the  ECOA,  COPPA  or  CAN–SPAM,  the  agency  must  notify  the 
DOJ, which has the right to bring the case itself. Because the FTC is currently lim-
ited to seeking civil penalties for rule or order violations or for specific statutory vio-
lations,  the  DOJ  has  not  exercised  that  right,  and  for  those  kinds  of  enforcement 
actions,  the  opportunity  for  DOJ  involvement  may  be  less  important.  However,  if 
the  FTC  were  also  given  the  authority  to  seek  civil  penalties  based  on  an  alleged 
unfair or deceptive act or practice, as discussed above, DOJ oversight would be cru-
cial.  If  a  company  were  to  face  the  prospect  of  substantial  penalties  for  an  act  or 
practice  that  had  never  previously  been  determined  by  any  court  or  agency  to  be 
unfair  or  deceptive,  then  review  and  input  by  the  DOJ  would  assure  that  the  act 
or  practice  warranted  prosecution  for  civil  penalties,  rather  than  less  draconian  re-
lief. For that reason, there should be no change to the current requirement that the 
FTC involve the DOJ in civil penalty actions. 
Section 7. Liability for Aiding and Abetting 

The bill would make it unlawful to ‘‘aid or abet another person violating any pro-
vision of this Act or any other Act enforceable by the Commission.’’ There is no defi-
nition of ‘‘aid or abet’’—terms that are usually used in a criminal context. 
Section 8. Permissive Administrative Procedure for Consumer Protection Rules 

This  section  would  allow  the  agency,  by  a  majority  vote  of  the  full  Commission, 
to  promulgate  rules  on  any  consumer  protection  matter  under  the  expedited  rules 
of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), rather than under the procedures of the 
Magnuson-Moss  Act.  The  expedited  rulemaking  authority  could  lead  to  a  serious 
‘‘rush  to  judgment,’’  allowing  the  FTC  to  create  major  industry-wide  regulatory 
changes without adequate time for business input and thoughtful consideration. 

The Magnuson-Moss rulemaking requirements, which have been in effect for more 
than  30  years,  provide  procedural  safeguards  that  are  appropriate  when  a  Federal 
agency is given a broad mandate to proscribe by regulation ‘‘unfair or deceptive acts

or  practices’’  in  interstate  commerce.  When  applied  to  the  Commission’s  consumer 
protection  mission,  ‘‘unfair  or  deceptive  acts  or  practices’’  can  be,  and  has  been,  in-
terpreted  very  broadly.  Without  adequate  opportunity  for  concerned  public  input, 
the agency could promulgate rules that are based on subjective notions of unfairness 
or  on  an  incomplete  understanding  of  an  industry  or  of  the  full  consequences  of  a 
rule. When Congress gave the FTC substantive rulemaking authority in the Magnu-
son-Moss  Act  of  1975,  it  included  procedural  safeguards  against  these  dangers.  As 
a result, Magnuson-Moss rulemaking procedures require more than just the ‘‘notice 
and comment’’ requirements of the APA. They also require the FTC to conduct pub-
lic hearings and to give interested parties an opportunity to present data, views and 
arguments  and  conduct  cross  examination  of  the  witnesses.  Any  final  rule  must  be 
based  on  the  rulemaking  record,  and  published  with  a  statement  of  basis  and  pur-
pose. The final rule is subject to review by a U.S. Court of Appeals. It is noteworthy 
in  this  regard  that,  in  at  least  two  instances,  a  Court  of  Appeals  overturned  the 
FTC’s final rule as unsupported by the record. In many other cases, the Magnuson- 
Moss rulemaking process led the FTC to decline to publish a final rule or to promul-
gate a more reasonable rule than originally proposed. Thus, the deliberative process 
inherent in Magnuson-Moss rulemaking has served the public interest well. 

The FTC has promulgated APA rules from time to time pursuant to a specific Act 
of Congress, such as under the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Pre-
vention  Act  and  the  FACTA  amendments  to  the  FCRA.  In  those  cases,  however, 
Congress specifically delineated the scope of the FTC’s authority. Absent such statu-
tory restrictions, there would be inadequate limits on the FTC’s authority to define 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices. 

FTC  rules  establish  industry  standards,  proscribe  conduct  and  carry  significant 
civil  penalties  for  violations.  For  these  reasons,  it  is  imperative  that  the  rules  be 
promulgated  in  accordance  with  the  procedural  safeguards  of  the  Magnuson  Moss 
Act. 
Section  9.  Rulemaking  Procedure  for  Subprime  Lending  Mortgages  and  Nontradi-

tional Mortgage Loans 

The  bill  would  require  the  FTC  to  promulgate  APA  rules  for  subprime  mortgage 
and  nontraditional  mortgage  loans.  The  bill  provides  no  specificity  or  guidance  of 
any  kind  as  to  the  substance  or  scope  of  such  rules.  The  provision  is  nothing  short 
of  a  complete  abdication  of  the  responsibilities  of  Congress  to  consider  and  enact 
such legislation as may be necessary and appropriate in these areas. 
Section 11. Enforcement by State Attorneys General 

The bill would give state attorneys general the authority to enforce a violation of 
whatever  rule  the  FTC  would  promulgate  for  subprime  mortgage  and  non-tradi-
tional mortgage loans (as provided for in Section 9). In addition, state attorneys gen-
eral could enforce violations of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) or the Home Own-
ership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). The bill would also give the state Attor-
neys  General  the  authority  to  enforce  the  provisions  of  the  FTC  Act  or  any  other 
Act  enforced  by  the  FTC  with  respect  to  violations  of  the  FTC  rules  for  subprime 
mortgage and non-traditional mortgage loans and for violations of TILA or HOEPA. 
Thus,  the  bill  would  empower  state  Attorneys  General  with  all  the  authority  and 
remedies currently available to the FTC, including injunctive relief, monetary dam-
ages, restitution and other consumer redress. 

Currently, state attorney general enforcement of Federal law is limited to specific 
Acts of Congress. State attorney general enforcement actions involving unfair or de-
ceptive acts or practices are appropriately limited to the state laws affecting the citi-
zens of that state. If Congress were to give the state Attorneys General the author-
ity to enforce the Federal rules and statutes, the result would be the creation of new 
Federal requirements and prohibitions based on state enforcement actions. State at-
torney general lawsuits enforcing the Federal law could result in duplicative and in-
consistent lawsuits based on the same conduct. Such lawsuits would undermine the 
Federal standards under the FTC rules and Federal statutes. Moreover, state unfair 
or  deceptive  acts  or  practices  statutes  often  provide  that  they  are  to  be  interpreted 
consistently with the Federal law. As a result, a state attorney general action could 
create new law in other states, as well as under the Federal law. 

It  is  unnecessary  to  give  state  Attorneys  General  this  new  power.  As  a  matter  of 
practice, the state Attorneys General regularly join with the FTC in enforcement ac-
tions  and  settlements.  When  they  do  so,  however,  each  attorney  general  proceeds 
under its own state law, which is how it should be. 
Personal Finance Education Programs 

Part  of  the  solution  must  also  include  consumer  education  programs  that  equip 
potential  homeowners  with  a  clear  understanding  of  the  mortgage  lending  process

and the tools that are available to them in choosing the mortgage product that best 
meets  their  financial  needs.  AFSA’s  Education  Foundation  (AFSAEF)  has  produced 
a  world-class  personal  finance  curriculum,  MoneySKILL,  which  aims  to  help  high 
school  students  meet  the  financial  challenges  that  lay  ahead.  MoneySKILL  is  a 
highly interactive, reality-based Internet curriculum. The course consists of 34 ‘‘how 
to’’  modules  on  income,  money  management,  spending  and  credit,  and  saving  and 
investing. MoneySKILL is used by educators in all 50 states and several other coun-
tries. More than 80,000 students have enrolled in the program. AFSAEF also plans 
to translate MoneySKILL into Spanish and undertake a campaign to encourage the 
Latino community to use this curriculum. 

In  addition,  AFSAEF  has  developed  an  educational  mortgage  brochure,  available 
in  both  English  and  Spanish,  in  conjunction  with  AFSA  and  the  American  Associa-
tion  of  Residential  Mortgage  Regulators.  The  brochure  contains  worksheets  to  help 
consumers  shop  for  the  best  mortgage  deal  and  determine  an  affordable  monthly 
mortgage payment. A glossary defines basic, but important, loan terms, such as An-
nual Percentage Rate, finance charge, balloon payment and arbitration clause. 
Borrower Contact with Lenders 

As  you  can  see,  lenders  are  working  successfully  with  credit  counselors  to  help 
at-risk  borrowers  stay  in  their  homes.  Where  we  need  help  is  reaching  as  many 
homeowners as possible about the importance of contacting their lenders if they are 
having  difficulty  making  their  mortgage  payment.  Far  too  many  homeowners  have 
not  taken  this  step,  often  because  of  ignorance,  fear,  or  a  combination  of  the  two. 
Yet  the  sooner  these  borrowers  contact  their  lenders,  the  better  their  chances  of 
finding a workable solution. 

As  this  committee  considers  how  best  to  assist  at  risk  borrowers,  we  encourage 
you to augment the private sector’s efforts to convey this important message. In par-
ticular,  the  U.S.  Treasury  Department’s  Office  of  Financial  Education  and/or  the 
newly  created  President’s  Advisory  Council  on  Financial  Literacy  may  be  ideal 
places to conduct these kinds of campaigns. 

Again,  AFSA  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  Subcommittee  on  the 
state  of  the  mortgage  market,  efforts  by  industry  to  partner  with  the  government 
agencies and consumer counselors to provide mortgage security to at-risk borrowers, 
and our members’ perspective on policy recommendations currently before Congress. 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Himpler, thank you very much. First of all, 
I appreciate you being here, and I might say to you, the last thing 
you should lose sleep over is that the Congress would rush to judg-
ment about anything. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator DORGAN. This is not a body known for speeding. And my 

hope is that we will begin to take some effective action soon. 

First  of  all,  I  thank  all  of  you  for  providing,  in  many  ways,  dif-
ferent  viewpoints  about  a  very  controversial  issue.  Mr.  Himpler, 
yours are perhaps more different than the other three, I might say. 

Mr. HIMPLER. I noticed that too, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator DORGAN. But, let me ask, if I might, Mr. Himpler, first— 
you  saw  the  advertisements  that  I  used  on  the  clip  and  you  saw 
what I was able to pull off the Internet at the moment. Are compa-
nies that would advertise like that able to be a member of your or-
ganization?  In  other  words,  do  you  have  any  self-regulation  inside 
your organization? 

Mr.  HIMPLER.  Yes,  we  do.  We  have  best  practices  and  voluntary 
standards that all of our—our member companies must meet. I will 
say  that  the  Countrywide  was  the  only  lender  that  I  noticed  in 
both the charts that you had and the advertisements on the screen. 
Senator  DORGAN.  And  Countrywide,  for  example—there  have 
been stories—and I have not documented them personally—but I’ve 
seen  stories  in  major  publications  that  talk  about  the  number  of 
mortgages  that  were  written  by  Countrywide  for  borrowers  who 
qualified for non-subprime loans but were put into subprimes with

pre-payments  and  so  on.  When  that  happens,  does  your  organiza-
tion have any mechanism by which you’re policing these standards? 
Mr.  HIMPLER.  We  have  an  Executive  Committee  that  reviews 
those matters and makes advisements to our board. But, I will say 
that  as  a  best  practice—this  goes  back  a  few  years  ago  now  when 
the House was considering predatory lending legislation in the last 
Congress,  a  number  of  our  members,  on  our  Mortgage  Advisory 
Board,  sent  a  letter  to  Congressman  Kanjorski,  specifically  ad-
dressing that very issue of steering, and have made it a best prac-
tice of our association not to. 

Senator DORGAN. But from what we now know, the largest mort-

gage lender in America was pretty busy steering. 

Mr. HIMPLER. I don’t know how old that—the advertisement that 
you  had  was  up,  and  I  don’t  know  the  time-frame  under  which 
you’re speaking, Senator. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Attorney  General  Blumenthal,  you  heard  Mr. 
Himpler say that if we have Attorneys General involved in the var-
ious  States,  enforcing  a  Federal  rule,  you’ll  have  a  mess  on  your 
hands. Respond to that, if you would? 

Mr.  BLUMENTHAL.  Well,  I  think  the  bad  guys  will  have  a  mess 
on their hands. The kinds of ads that you’ve seen here will be pur-
sued  before  they  become  a  template  for  the  failure  of  the  system. 
You  know,  the  argument  that  there  will  be  duplicative  actions, 
we’ll  have  50  different  interpretations,  you  know,  I’ve  heard  it  for 
18  years,  it  just  doesn’t  happen.  It’s  a  false  argument.  Because 
what  happens  really  is,  that  Attorneys  General  work  together,  as 
we did on Household Finance, where 19 Attorneys General brought 
an  action  under  our  consumer  protection  laws,  which  are  largely 
identical,  or  Ameriquest,  where  all  50  Attorneys  General  brought 
actions based on our consumer protection laws. 

Now,  we  could  bring  those  actions,  then.  Now,  Household  Fi-
nance  has  chartered  itself  or  licensed  itself  federally,  so  it  would 
be  beyond  our  jurisdiction  today.  But  we  recovered  in  Household 
Finance  for  consumers  and  States  about  $484  million,  because  we 
recovered  for  excessive  interest  rates,  unconscionable  fees,  abusive 
pre-payment  penalties,  unnecessary  insurance  charges—all  the 
kinds of abuses that we then found in Ameriquest, where we recov-
ered  $325  million,  and  all  the  same  practices  that  we  see  today. 
And  I  would  second  Mr.  Rheingold’s  observation,  that  what  has 
happened  is,  that  those  abusive  practices  have  migrated.  The  can-
cer  has  metastasized  into  the  general  business  practices  in  the  in-
dustry. 

There  are,  by  in  large,  hard-working,  honest  people  in  this  busi-
ness,  but  like  any  cancer,  if  it’s  not  checked,  it  will  grow  and  kill 
the person, the patient. And that’s what we’re seeing in the seizing 
up of all our credit markets. 

As you have observed, now the effects are rippling and spreading 
through the economy. The disconnect between the loans and the ul-
timate owner of those loans is now so complex that not only is the 
market  undermined,  but  it  is  impossible  to  unravel  the  loans.  And 
as much as everyone wants some relief provided to homeowners, it 
is  a  challenge  to  know  how  to  do  it  because  the  ultimate  owner  of 
that loan is so disconnected from the homeowner.

57 

And  I  might  just  make  this  last  point,  because  we’re  involved 
and we get the same argument that you’ve heard here this morning 
on  anti-trust,  where  we  now  have  an  investigation  underway  into 
the sales of those investment instruments that sliced and diced and 
securitized—investigations  because  the  buyers  of  those  securities, 
we  believe,  may  have  been  mislead  and  deceived  as  to  how  secure 
they  were.  And,  that  potential  deception  involved  not  just  the  in-
vestment  banks,  but  also  the  credit  rating  agencies,  and  others  in 
this industry. 

So, there’s a lot of work to do here, Mr. Chairman. And the argu-
ment that State should be barred from enforcement simply because 
there  would  be  more  of  it,  and  it  would  be  uncontrolled  centrally, 
I think is profoundly fallacious. 

Senator DORGAN. So you’re opposed to it. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator DORGAN. Ms. Keest, let me ask you—you heard the testi-
mony  of  the  Attorney  General  about  his  belief  that  pre-payment 
penalties ‘‘should be abolished.’’ I’m going to ask Mr. Himpler about 
pre-payment  penalties  in  a  moment,  but  what  is  your  assessment 
of the role pre-payment penalties have in all this? 

Ms.  KEEST.  I  would  say  that  pre-payment  penalties  had,  sort  of, 

three key roles in there. 

First,  and  the  most  obvious  one,  is  that  they  locked  people  into 
bad loans. What often happened when people got in with deception, 
you  know,  the  logical  thing  to  do  once  they  figured  it  out  was  to 
try  to  get  out  as  quickly  as  possible,  but  those  pre-payment  pen-
alties locked them in. That part of it is visible and that we all saw 
fairly early on. 

The  part  that  was  more  part  of  this  whole  structural,  funda-
mental problem, is that—that it became part of steering, it became 
part of making loans more expensive at both the front and the back 
ends  for  consumers,  and  it  became  part  of  the  incentive—the  per-
verse  incentives.  Which  is  to  say  that,  because  Wall  Street  liked 
pre-payment penalties, Wall Street not only paid the brokers more 
for  loans  with  pre-payment  penalties,  but  they  then  penalized  bro-
kers  by  reducing  the  amount  of  what’s  called  yield-spread  pre-
miums,  which  is  sort  of  the  rate  back—the  kick  back  they  get  out 
of  the  rate—by  reducing  that,  if  the  broker  delivered  them  a  loan 
without a pre-payment penalty. 

So,  pre-payment  penalties  are  integrally  involved  in,  sort  of,  the 
structural  unfairness  of  these  loans.  And,  they  are  often  justified 
as  a  way  of  buying  a,  you  know,  sort  of  lower  rate,  but  the  data 
indicates that’s not there. 

Senator DORGAN. As I understand, a pre-payment penalty is this: 
The  way  the  system  has  worked  is  if  you  have  a  mortgage  with  a 
pre-payment  penalty,  and  it’s  a  subprime  mortgage  that  resets  at 
a higher interest rate than normal, then attach a pre-payment pen-
alty  to  that,  and  then  securitize  it  and  cut  it  up  and  sell  it  some-
place,  embedded  in  that  new  security  is  a  pre-payment  penalty, 
which  guarantees  the  higher  rate  will  follow  the  security  through 
its life. 

So  that  makes  it  more  attractive  to  hedge  funds.  It  makes  it 
more  attractive  to  the  system  in  which  you  sell  the  security.  That 
gets back to the proposition that the lender no longer has the loan.

The  borrower  comes  to  the  lender  and  says,  ‘‘I’ve  got  a  problem 
here,  can  we  work  on  it?’’  And  they  say,  ‘‘Well,  I  don’t  have  your 
loan.’’ 

And they can follow it in many cases through two or three sales, 
which  transfers  risk,  transfers  the  asset,  which  is  now  a  security. 
And you can’t really unwrap or unravel it for a lender to be talking 
effectively to a borrower. 

So,  what  I’d  like  to  hear  from  you,  Mr.  Himpler,  is  the  issue  of 
how  these  pre-payment  penalties  developed.  Have  they  been 
around  for  a  long  time?  And  how  do  they  play  a  role  here  in  help-
ing guarantee the reset at the higher interest rate under subprime 
that makes Wall Street happy? 

Mr. HIMPLER. Well, I’m glad you asked if they’ve been around for 
some  time,  because  I  think  this  story  does  go  back  some  time.  Es-
sentially  what  we’re  talking  about  in  the  subprime  arena  and 
securitization,  is  a  story  that  goes  back  15,  20,  maybe  even  30 
years. It wasn’t too long ago that we were—maybe 20 years or so— 
that  if  you  had  blemished  credit,  you  were  essentially  shut  out 
from the American Dream. 

We  took  credit  from  an  on/off  switch,  if  you  will,  to  a,  more  of 
a dial type of mechanism, whereby lenders can price for risk. That 
allowed a number of folks that fit into the subprime category to be 
able to buy their first home. 

Essentially,  in  order  to  preserve  the  investment  that  they  had, 
to have greater certainty about the cash-flow that’s associated with 
a  subprime  loan,  investors  wanted  pre-payment  penalties,  to  en-
sure  that  they—they  were  putting  up  their  money  for  a  certain 
number  of  years,  they  wanted  to  make  sure  that  they  had  a  cash- 
flow from that investment for the years that they were putting up. 
That’s essentially where it comes from. 

They  can  also  be  used  to  buy  down  interest  rates.  Despite  my 
friend  Kathleen’s  reports,  we’ve  also  got  studies  that  pre-payment 
penalties  do,  essentially,  afford  borrowers  to  get  a  lower  interest 
rate over the life of the loan. 

The—generally  speaking,  pre-payment  penalties  don’t  last  over 
the  life  of  the  loan.  More  importantly,  the  good  news,  if  you  will, 
is  that  as  of  last  year,  the  Federal  financial  regulators,  as  well  as 
the  State  financial  regulators,  which  followed  suit  under  subprime 
mortgage  guidance,  have  essentially  limited  the  scope  of  pre-pay-
ment  penalties  so  that  they  must  expire  before  a  first  reset  of  a 
mortgage interest rate. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Rheingold,  I  want  to  ask  you  about  the 
general  proposition  here.  My  understanding  of  the  general  propo-
sition  has  been  that—seeing  these  advertisements  and  seeing  the 
money  that’s  involved  in  this  stream—you  can  essentially  attract 
someone  who  doesn’t  have  perfect  credit  and  perhaps  may  have 
filed bankruptcy or may have not particularly good credit, and say 
to them, ‘‘We will provide you a mortgage.’’ 

In  fact,  some  of  this,  represents  cold  calls  to  a  home  of  someone 
who already has an existing mortgage they’re perfectly happy with. 
This cold call from a broker says, ‘‘We have a mortgage where you 
pay  no  principal  in  the  first  period.  In  fact,  not  only  do  you  not 
have  to  pay  principal,  but  also  you  don’t  have  to  pay  a  portion  of

59 

the interest, so no principal and only a portion of the interest. And 
by the way, you don’t have to document your income.’’ 

Is that the case? I mean, that’s what I’ve read. Is it the cast that 
that’s  the  kind  of  sales  technique  that  would  put  a  mortgage  out 
there  in  the  hands  of  a  borrower  who’s  pretty  unsuspecting  about 
the consequences of all of that? 

Mr. RHEINGOLD. It’s kind of mind boggling, isn’t it? 
Senator DORGAN. It is. 
Mr. RHEINGOLD. But in fact, that’s exactly what’s happened. 
Again,  those  advertisements—those  products  really  are  a  symp-
tom.  There  were  people  who  wanted  to  buy  those  loans,  because 
they were high-yield and high-risk loans. It had nothing to do with 
what was best for the consumer. 

I  think  one  of  the  things  that’s  happened  in  our  country,  when 
you look at those products, when you talk about somebody in bank-
ruptcy  or  who  had  bad  credit,  is  we’ve  gotten  away  from,  sort  of, 
the  traditional  notion  that  it’s  good  to  save,  that  you  need  to  have 
some  money  to  put  down  into  your  house,  that  your  house  is  not 
your  bank,  that  in  fact,  putting  money  down,  earning  enough 
money, making sure you buy a house that fits into your budget, are 
good things. 

And  instead,  what  we’ve  turned  around,  because  there  was  this 
voracious  appetite  for  mortgage  loans,  we  created  these  ridiculous 
products that were destined for failure, not because it was good for 
our  economy,  not  because  it  was  good  for  our  neighborhoods  or 
community,  and  certainly  not  because  it  was  good  for  our  con-
sumers,  but  because  we  had  a  beast  that  needed  to  be  fed.  And 
that was completely wrong. 

And  I  think  all  of  those  things,  I  mean,  all  of  those  ads,  all  the 
things we see daily, the credit card ads that you see that keep en-
couraging  people  to  get  into  debt.  The  notion  that  you  should  get 
a  loan  that  allows  you  to  pay  less,  that  allows  your  home  to  get— 
to be negative amortizing, that your principal continues to go up— 
is absurd. 

It may work for a few people. That product was designed for one 
point,  sort  of,  it’s  not  the  products  that  kill,  it  the  people  who  sell 
them  that  kill.  There’s  a  market  for  that  product,  right?  If  you’re 
a  really  sophisticated  consumer  and  you  want  to  pay  less  on  your 
mortgage  because  you’ve  got  all  these  great  investments,  and  in-
stead  of  having  to  pay  five,  you  know,  you  don’t  want  to  pay  it  at 
7  percent  interest,  you’re  going  to  go  stick  it  in  some  bonds  and 
make  20  percent,  you’re  going  to  invest  that  money,  maybe  that 
loan  works  for  you.  But  for  the  average  American  consumer,  that 
product is insane. 

And  the  fact  is,  is  that  nobody  understood  what  they  were  get-
ting, or at least, unless they were sort of speculative investors and 
that’s  still  a  small  portion  of  the  mortgage  borrowers,  people  did 
not understand any of this. They had a chance to pursue the Amer-
ican  Dream,  it  was  sold  hard  to  them,  and  they  were  told  they 
could  buy  the  house  of  their  dreams  with  this  loan,  and  they  fell 
for it, and they had no protection. 

Ms. KEEST. Mr. Chairman? 
Senator DORGAN. Yes. 
Ms. KEEST. Could I supplement——

60 

Senator DORGAN. Yes. 
Ms. KEEST.—something that he just said? It sort of relates to the 
fragmented  nature  of  the  market.  What  we  saw  from  Countrywide 
was  their  ads  for  the  payment  option  ARMs.  Countrywide  is  such 
a  big  organization,  that  it  has  different  kinds  of  lenders  within  it, 
including non-bank lenders and bank lenders. 

And, I don’t know whether this was routine or not, but the Coun-
trywide  payment  option  ARMs,  like  those  that  were  advertised, 
that  I  saw,  made  in  2005,  were  made  through  the  national  bank 
that  Countrywide  had,  not  through  the  non-banks.  Now,  whether 
that  was  their  practice  routinely  or  not,  I—or  whether  it  was  an 
accident of what I saw, I don’t know. 

But one of the things that I think, you know, is interesting about 
the  fragment—fragmented  nature  of  the  oversight  is  the  question 
of  whether  or  not  they  were  in—with  that  kind  of  a  product  and 
that kind of advertising, they were less afraid of the Federal regu-
lator—Federal  banking  regulator  than  they  were  of  the  FTC  and 
the  State  Attorney  Generals.  I  would  be  interested  in  knowing 
that. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Well,  someone  once  said,  the  problem  isn’t  the 

arrow, it’s the archer. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator DORGAN. And in many ways that’s the case here. We can 
get  rid  of  bad  practices,  bad  products,  deceptive  advertising,  we 
can—but  it’s  the  culture  here  that  has  grown  up  in  recent  years, 
in  which  there  is,  to  quote  Ross  Perot  on  another  subject,  ‘‘There 
is a giant sucking sound, it seems to me, coming from markets that 
want  to  securitize  almost  everything  and  move  them  along.’’  I  call 
it  an  area  of  dark  money  these  days  because  the  financial  engi-
neers  have  found  really  unique  and  almost  unbelievable  ways  to 
securitize almost everything, and the transparency is gone for a lot 
of it. 

We should ask ourselves, how is it that the biggest firms on Wall 
Street, presumably with these unbelievably smart people, have lost 
so  much  money  because  they  didn’t  understand  what  my  parents 
and  your  parents  would  understand:  if  you’re  going  to  provide  a 
home loan to somebody, it ought to be to somebody that might have 
a  reasonable  chance  of  being  able  to  make  monthly  payments.  I 
mean, that’s not high finance, that’s basic. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  DORGAN.  So,  we’re  trying  to  understand  what  has  hap-
pened here, how to change it, how to shut down the bad practices, 
how  to  make  sure  it  doesn’t  happen  again  because  the  con-
sequences of this are pretty staggering. The consequences are econ-
omy-wide  and  everybody  is  affected.  This  practice  helped  exacer-
bate the housing bubble, and its collapsed now, has—— 

Mr. HIMPLER. There were a lot—there were a lot of practices. 
Senator  DORGAN.  —there  were  a  lot  practices,  but  this  was  an 
accommodating  practice,  for  sure.  And,  as  I  said,  I  was  going  to— 
Mr.  Rheingold,  give  you  a  chance  to  give  due  credit  to  the  Office 
of  the  Comptroller  of  the  Currency—you  just  mentioned  it  briefly. 
It deserves, it really deserves more mention, perhaps, at this hear-
ing.

61 

Mr.  RHEINGOLD.  Sure.  They  do—there  was  a  special  place  for 
them,  there  really  is.  I  mean,  this  was  a  bank  regulator  who  not 
only  did  nothing,  as  the  world  was  falling  apart  around  them,  but 
they stopped everybody else from doing something. It really, there’s 
no words to describe. 

I’m a private attorney, a legal services attorney, I work as a non- 
profit  attorney.  We  brought  cases,  we  knew  what  was  going  on 
here,  we  saw  all  of  the  bad  practices.  I’ve  seen  this  for  a  dozen 
years.  And  in  case  after  case  where  private  attorneys  bring  cases, 
you can be sure the OCC is going to step in and say that State law 
doesn’t  apply  to  my  national  bank,  let  alone  what  they  did  to 
States  Attorneys  General.  It  is  an  absolute—they  should—they 
should be ashamed of themselves. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Let  me  ask  briefly—the  legislation  that  I  have 
proposed,  reauthorizing  the  Federal  Trade  Commission—generally, 
are you supportive of that, Mr. Rheingold? 

Mr. RHEINGOLD. Absolutely. 
Senator DORGAN. Ms. Keest? 
Ms. KEEST. Yes. 
Senator DORGAN. And, Attorney General Blumenthal? 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I do as well, and if I might just—— 
Senator DORGAN. Yes. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL.—address a couple of points. 
First of all, as you may have gathered, I join in the general opin-
ion that has been expressed about the OCC, but there are a bunch 
of  other  Federal  agencies,  including  the  Federal  Reserve,  and  a 
number  of  Federal  supposed  enforcers  that  have  been  completely 
AWOL  here.  And,  just  to  repeat,  have  not  only  seized  complete 
power,  but  also  blocked  others  from  exercising  any  power,  and 
failed to use it themselves. 

But,  I  want  to,  because  it  might  be  my  last  chance  to  speak, 
come  back  to  a  point  that  you  raised  at  the  very  beginning,  who’s 
at fault? You know, obviously, some of the pushback to you, in your 
debate,  when  you  aggressively  seek  the  kind  of  legislation  which  I 
do support, the reauthorization bill that would provide stronger en-
forcement,  more  resources,  will  be—well,  ‘‘You  know,  the  home 
owners  should  have  known  it  was  too  good  to  be  true.  You  know, 
who gets a mortgage for a fraction of a percent of 2 percent?’’ 

Well,  you  know,  Mr.  Chairman,  what  we’ve  seen  at  the  ground 
level,  what  we  see  in  ordinary  consumers,  the  real  lives,  is  that 
they are persuaded, they don’t need an attorney of their own, they 
don’t  need  a  home  inspector,  they  don’t  need  any  sort  of  inde-
pendent  advice  that  would  help  them  evaluate  all  that  squiggly 
fine print that you see on the screen here and that mortgages typi-
cally include as well. 

And  often,  what  we  found  in  Ameriquest,  for  example,  and  what 
we’ve  found  in  our  local  predatory  loan  schemes,  is  that  the  deal 
has  changed  when  the  consumer  appears  at  the  closing.  Often  he 
is  literally  moved  into  the  house  with  his  family  or  he’s  sold—he’s 
moved out of the other house or he’s sold, sometimes sold the house 
that  he  had.  And  literally,  on  the  verge  of  the  closing,  the  terms 
are changed, as a kind of bait-and-switch. 

So,  this  idea  that  the  consumer  should  have  known,  I  think  is— 
is also fallacious, and I think that it also defeats the argument that

the  markets  should  be  allowed  to  work  without  any  regulation, 
without  any  intervention,  because  the  markets  are  simply  not 
working if there is deceptive and misleading pitches and practices. 
And,  I  would  just  conclude  by  saying,  one  of  the  reasons  why  I 
think  that  this  bill  is  so  important,  is,  you  know,  we  have  a  lot  of 
laws  on  the  books,  if  they’re  not  enforced,  they’re  dead  letter.  And 
that’s the problem with a lot of the best Federal laws, that the Fed-
eral agencies responsible for enforcing them simply aren’t doing so, 
and  I  think  this  bill  should  send  a  message  to  them  and  send  a 
message to the industry that there will be real penalties. 

I differ with the view that was expressed earlier about penalties 
being  excessive  in  this  bill.  We  need  stronger  penalties  and  we 
need  to  see  them  imposed,  otherwise  they’ll  be  seen  as  simply  the 
cost  of  doing  business.  And,  the  bad  guys  in  this  industry,  even  if 
they’re just a minority, will give everyone a bad name and do harm 
to the economy. 

Senator DORGAN. Attorney General, thank you very much. 
And,  Mr.  Himpler,  I  would  say—I  asked  the  others  about  the 
FTC Reauthorization bill. I noted your objections in your testimony 
to the bill. 

Mr. HIMPLER. Is it possible for me to—— 
Senator DORGAN. Yes, of course. 
Mr.  HIMPLER.  OK.  A  couple  comments,  I  know  it  may  surprise 
Attorney General Blumenthal, but to a certain extent I agree with 
some  of  his  comments.  Our  association  doesn’t  have  any  problem 
with the borrower having independent representation at settlement 
to  make  sure  that  they  understand  the  mortgage  contract  that 
they’re undertaking. We think it’s vitally important and we’re com-
mitted to that. 

On the issue of securitization, let me be the lone voice that says 
that  I  still  think  it  plays  a  very  vital  role  in  our  financial  services 
sector. It’s—we’re talking about a phenomena that has taken place 
over  the  last  10  to  15  years.  No  one  would  say  that  Fannie  and 
Freddie should stop securitizing. We do need to learn some lessons. 
I  stand  shoulder  to  shoulder  with  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  in  the  need 
for  transparency  in  that  area,  but  I  think  it’s  still  a  vital  piece  of 
the puzzle. 

Senator  DORGAN.  I  learned  a  lesson  about  these  things  some 
while  ago  when  we  had  a  major  flooding  disaster.  An  entire  city 
was  evacuated  and  there  were  small  business  disaster  loans  pro-
vided by the SBA to people who had suffered greatly. 

And  later,  when  some  issues  arose,  we  tried  to  track  back  on 
these  loans,  and  they  were  sold  by  the  SBA,  so  it  wasn’t  a  case 
where  even  a  Federal  agency  could  sit  down  with  the  person  who 
had  borrowed  the  money  because  they’d  sold  it.  And  I  was  one  of 
the  most  surprised  people  around  trying  to  understand  that  even 
the Federal Government had gotten into some of this act. 

Well, I want to thank all of you for being here and providing in-
formation.  I  thank  Ms.  Parnes  for  listening  to  the  testimony  as 
well.  I  want  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  to  do  well.  I  want  us, 
as  a  Congress,  to  try  to  think  through  and  understand  what  has 
happened  and  what  we  must  prevent  from  happening  again,  and 
how we put this back on track to represent the kind of home mort-
gage lending we would expect.

The  housing  industry  is  a  very  big  industry  in  our  country.  The 
dream of owning a home is an important American Dream. And the 
notion  of  financing  it  is  one  of  the  most  complicated  things  that 
happens  in  the  life  of  a  consumer,  and  we  need  to  get  this  right. 
It got far off track and we need to bring it back.

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 
Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  holding  today’s  hearing  on  how  the  Federal  Trade 
Commission’s  (FTC)  oversight  of  subprime  lenders  can  be  more  effective.  I  am  ap-
preciative  of  Chairman  Dorgan’s  steadfast  efforts  to  combat  these  flagrant  abuses. 
I also welcome the expert witnesses who will testify today about the impact of pred-
atory lending on American consumers and how the FTC can better regulate this in-
dustry to both help us get out of the current housing crisis, caused by the subprime 
lending grist, and to prevent the next crisis from occurring. I am particularly inter-
ested  this  morning  in  hearing  comments  on  steps  we  in  Congress  could  take  to 
broaden the FTC’s oversight authority over unscrupulous mortgage lenders. 

I am deeply concerned that it could take the FTC up to 10 years, under the Mag-
nuson-Moss  Act,  to  put  out  ‘‘new’’  oversight  rules.  Because  this  Act  prescribes  a 
rulemaking  procedure  which  requires  the  FTC  to  accept  oral  testimony,  evidence, 
and  make  fact-finding  determinations,  we  might  be  in  our  next—heavens  forbid— 
housing crisis before the FTC is able to put out a ‘‘new’’ rule. We in Congress need 
to  help  arm  the  FTC  with  as  many  weapons  as  possible  to  combat  and  rectify  the 
current housing crisis, and streamlining the FTC’s present method by moving to Ad-
ministrative  Procedure  Act  (APA)  notice-and-comment  rulemaking  will  help  speed 
up the process. 

To  comprehend  the  devastating  effects  that  predatory  loans  are  having  on  our 
economy, it is imperative that we understand the magnitude of mortgage difficulties 
facing our Nation. By 2009, more than a trillion dollars of mortgages originated dur-
ing the subprime lending boom will reset to higher interest rates. Currently, accord-
ing  to  the  Mortgage  Bankers  Association,  subprime  adjustable  rate  mortgages 
(ARMS)  constitute  42  percent  of  foreclosures  started  during  the  fourth  quarter  of 
2007.  This  exceptionally  high  number  is  expected  to  skyrocket  over  the  next  year 
once  the  subsequent  wave  of  adjustable  loans  reset  and  borrowers’  mortgage  pay-
ments  increase  by  30  to  50  percent.  In  December  2007,  the  Center  for  Responsible 
Lending predicted that 2.2 million families with subprime loans will lose their homes 
to foreclosure because of recent predatory lending. 

The FTC must vigorously fight against the type of predatory lending that is forc-
ing  so  many  Americans  into  foreclosure  and  causing  many  to  lose  their  homes.  For 
most  Americans,  their  home  is  the  single  largest  investment  and  their  retirement 
nest egg! Unfortunately, though the FTC has information warning consumers about 
predatory  mortgage  schemes  dating  back  to  1998  on  its  website,  the  Commission 
does  not  have  specific  rules  for  regulating  the  non-bank  lenders  that  account  for 
many of these predatory loans. 

The  FTC’s  job  is  to  protect  consumers  against  unfair  or  deceptive  acts  and  prac-
tices.  Our  experience  with  subprime  lending  has  taught  us  that  we  in  government 
must  work  to  prevent  similar  crises  from  occurring.  While  I  commend  the  FTC  for 
bringing  21  actions  against  companies  and  principals  in  the  mortgage  industry,  as 
well  as  monitoring  advertisements  for  illegal  claims  over  the  last  few  years,  I  won-
der if these activities are enough? 

Frankly,  the  enormity  of  the  subprime  mortgage  crisis  begs  us  to  question  why 
the FTC has not already promulgated rules to regulate non-bank lenders and if the 
FTC  has  sufficient  authority  to  oversee  non-bank  lenders,  such  as  mortgage  bro-
kers? 

I  am  especially  concerned  with  the  calamitous  consequences  of  unfair  predatory 
lending  that  continue  to  affect  borrowers  in  my  home  state  of  Maine.  According  to 
a recent report on subprime mortgages by Coastal Enterprises Inc., predatory lend-
ing  in  Maine  is  dominated  by  out-of-state  non-bank  lenders  and  mortgage  brokers 
that  are  subject  to  fewer  regulations  than  Maine-based  brokers.  The  report  esti-
mates that Maine families will lose at least $23.4 million annually because of equity 
stripping  from  predatory  mortgage  lending.  And  this  figure  does  not  include  fore-
closure costs!!

On  Friday,  March  7,  2008,  the  Portland  Press  Herald  reported  that,  according  to 
the Mortgage Bankers Association, Maine’s foreclosure rate is 2.36 percent of homes, 
above  the  national  rate  of  2.04  percent  of  homes.  This  rate  is  expected  to  only  in-
crease  over  the  next  few  years.  While  not  all  of  Maine’s  foreclosures  are  directly 
attributably to predatory lending, it makes me curious as to how Maine would have 
faired without those iniquitous, predatory loans. 

High  foreclosure  rates  harm  communities,  creates  blighted  areas,  and  stunt  local 
and national economic potential. Consequently, it is in the best interest of all of the 
parties  involved  in  the  subprime  crisis—the  banks,  the  investors,  and  the  bor-
rowers—to act to preserve homeownership and minimize foreclosures. 

In that vein, we should consider any and all measures to assist the FTC to more 
vigorously  regulate  the  conduct  of  non-bank  lenders.  Our  current  economic  down-
turn  threatens  the  stability  and  vitality  of  our  economy.  The  FTC  must  take  every 
action  within  its  power  to  reduce  predatory  lending  and  protect  consumers  against 
these onerous practices. It is my fervent hope that this hearing with provide us an-
swers on how the Congress can empower the FTC to better accomplish these goals. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

merce, Science, and Transportation’s Subcommittee on Interstate Commerce, Trade, 
and  Tourism  concerning  S.  2831,  The  Federal  Trade  Commission  (FTC)  Reauthor-
ization Act of 2008. 

MBA  supports  the  FTC’s  regulatory  efforts  respecting  lenders  not  regulated  by 
Federal  financial  regulators  and  the  efforts  of  the  FTC  and  Federal  financial  regu-
lators  to  stop  abusive  lending.  MBA  unequivocally  regards  abusive  lending  as  a 
stain  on  the  mortgage  industry  that  should  be  dealt  with  effectively  in  a  uniform 
manner. 

MBA  is  concerned;  however,  that  the  provisions  in  S.  2831  may  lead  to  unneces-
sarily  burdensome  and  overly  costly  regulation  of  the  mortgage  market  that  may 
undermine  uniform  regulation.  MBA  strongly  believes  judicious  regulation  and  a 
uniform national lending standard are the best means of providing consumers inno-
vative  financing  choices,  increased  competition  and  lower  costs.  MBA  has  the  fol-
lowing comments on the specific provisions of the bill. 

Section 3 would increase the FTC’s independent enforcement authority by remov-
ing  the  necessity  for  the  FTC  to  provide  a  45-day  opportunity  for  the  Department 
of  Justice  to  bring  a  civil  money  penalties  case  on  behalf  of  the  Government  before 
the  FTC  brings  a  case  of  its  own.  Under  current  law,  the  FTC  can  already  go  di-
rectly to court for injunctive relief, redress or monetary damages. Actions under the 
FTC’s  authority  are  grounded  in  its  Section  5  ‘‘unfair  and  deceptive  acts  and  prac-
tices’’  (UDAP)  authority  which  is  vague  and  can  be  applied  very  broadly.  Consid-
ering  this,  MBA  believes  the  provisions  under  current  law,  which  establishes  a 
‘‘check’’ for the Department of Justice, further the objective of assuring there is clear 
and consistent enforcement government-wide.

Section 5 would significantly broaden the FTC’s authority to seek civil money pen-
alties including penalties under its UDAP authority. This would pertain even where 
the FTC may have provided little or no guidance for companies regarding what con-
stitutes a violation. The penalties provided for in this section, up to $12,000 per vio-
lation,  may  compound  rapidly  for  behavior  that  may  not  have  been  thought  to  be 
illegal.  MBA  believes  statutes  with  vague  terms  should  not  have  significant  pen-
alties.  Such  statutes  increase  compliance  costs,  reduce  competition  and  ultimately 
result  in  higher  costs  to  borrowers.  Statutes  that  clearly  define  and  proscribe  mis-
behavior may be coupled with penalties as a deterrent. 

Section  8  would  provide  the  FTC  the  option,  by  a  majority  vote  of  the  full  Com-
mission,  to  promulgate  rules  on  any  consumer  protection  matter  under  the  expe-
dited rules of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), rather than under the pro-
cedures of the Magnuson-Moss Act. While other agencies may utilize the APA, they 
do  not  have  the  broad  jurisdictional  reach  of  the  FTC  or  its  broad,  and  at  times 
vague,  UDAP  authority.  MBA  is  concerned,  considering  the  UDAP  standards  in-
volved  coupled  with  increased  civil  penalties  for  violations,  that  the  FTC’s  powers 
may be overly increased by this change. 

Section  9  would  provide  the  FTC  authority  to  conduct  rulemaking  proceedings 
with  respect  to  ‘‘subprime  mortgage  lending  and  nontraditional  mortgage  loans.’’ 
MBA  believes  assigning  the  FTC  this  authority  may  invite  additional  rules  incon-
sistent with those of other Federal financial regulators. This problem would be fur-
ther exacerbated by the fact the bill does not define either the term ‘‘subprime mort-
gage  lending’’  or  ‘‘nontraditional  loans.’’  Without  further  guidance,  it  would  be  left 
to the FTC to define these terms and the scope of its rules, independent of any defi-
nitions  promulgated  by  the  Federal  banking  regulators  now  or  in  the  future.  The 
fact that this provision would invite varying regulation coupled with increased pen-
alties  and  jurisdiction  provided  elsewhere  in  the  bill,  would,  in  MBA’s  view,  result 
in unnecessary costs to the industry and ultimately to consumers. 

Section  10  would  broaden  the  FTC’s  authority  by  making  all  Federal  banking 
agencies,  not  just  the  Federal  Reserve  and  the  Federal  Home  Loan  Bank  Board 
(now  the  Office  of  Thrift  Supervision),  subject  to  the  FTC  Act.  Under  these  provi-
sions,  whenever  the  FTC  prescribes  a  rule  concerning  an  unfair  or  deceptive  prac-
tice, the agencies would have to adopt a similar rule within 60 days of the effective 
date  unless  the  agency  finds  the  practice  is  not  ‘‘unfair  or  deceptive’’  or  there  is  a 
finding  implementation  of  similar  regulations  with  respect  to  banks,  savings  and 
loans, or Federal credit unions would conflict with essential monetary and payment 
policies. 

While MBA appreciates the bill would require regulations be prescribed jointly ‘‘to 
the extent practicable,’’ MBA does not believe the bill would go far enough to ensure 
consistency  or  provide  sufficient  authority  for  Federal  financial  regulators  to  deter-
mine that an FTC rule should not be implemented. 

Section  11  would  allow  state  Attorneys  General,  with  60  days  notice,  to  bring 
cases under the FTC Act to seek civil penalties, disgorgement or injunctions against 
bad  actors  for  certain  actions.  These  actions  would  include  enforcement  of  a  viola-
tion  of  a  subprime  mortgage  lending  rule  or  a  nontraditional  mortgage  loan  rule, 
or  a  violation  of  the  Truth  in  Lending  Act  (TILA)  or  the  Home  Ownership  and  Eq-
uity  Protection  Act  (HOEPA)  with  respect  to  subprime  mortgage  lending  or  a  non-
traditional mortgage loan. 

Under  current  law,  state  Attorneys  General  regularly  work  with  the  FTC  and 
other  government  regulators  to  bring  a  wide  range  of  actions  using  state  consumer 
protection  laws  consistent  with  Federal  law.  MBA  does  not  believe  there  is  a  need 
to  provide  for  a  direct  action  by  state  Attorneys  General  under  Federal  law  and  is 
concerned  authorizing  such  action  would  simply  invite  widely  diverse  and  incon-
sistent  theories  and  interpretations  of  the  law  which  will  countermand  efforts  at 
greater uniformity. Adding to this concern is the fact actions may be brought in any 
district  where  a  lender  or  related  party  operates;  it  is  also  not  clear  whether  state 
actions  would  be  able  to  be  brought  under  these  provisions  as  well.  Finally,  as  a 
practical  matter,  the  notice  provision  would  allow  little  ‘‘check’’  to  ensure  consist-
ency.  FTC  is  unlikely  to  have  the  time  or  resources  to  regularize  lawsuits  across 
the country. 

Again, MBA appreciates the opportunity to provide comment to the Subcommittee 
and welcomes the opportunity to recommend specific changes to improve the bill as 
it moves through the legislative process. 

Sincerely, 

Senior Vice President, Government Affairs.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE TO 

LYDIA B. PARNES 

68 

Question  1.  According  to  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (FDIC),  non- 
bank  lenders  are  primarily  responsible  for  predatory  mortgage  loans.  Even  though 
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has oversight authority over nonbank lenders, 
to  date  it  has  not  published  a  broad  rule  for  overseeing  this  industry  or  regulating 
subprime  lending.  The  Federal  Trade  Commission  has  known  about  problems  with 
predatory mortgage loans for at least 10 years. On the Federal Trade Commission’s 
(FTC)  website,  there  is  a  document  entitled  ‘‘Home  Equity  Loans—Borrowers  Be-
ware’’ which was published by the FTC in April 1998. Knowing that predatory lend-
ing  is  an  ongoing  problem,  why  has  the  FTC  failed  to  promulgate  a  rule  to  govern 
non-bank  lenders?  If  the  Congress  doesn’t  enact  Senator  Dorgan’s  proposal,  which 
would  allow  the  FTC  to  promulgate  rules  under  the  Administrative  Procedures  Act 
(APA)  will  the  FTC  ever  issue  a  broad  rule  to  regulate  predatory  lending  and  the 
conduct of non-bank lenders. 

Answer. The Commission has had to decide how best to focus its efforts to protect 
consumers  in  the  subprime  mortgage  lending  area  that  has  expanded  so  rapidly  in 
recent  years.  As  primarily  a  law  enforcement  agency,  the  Commission  found  that 
focusing  its  resources  on  law  enforcement  allowed  the  agency  to  target  new  and 
evolving harmful practices, obtain redress for injured consumers, and obtain injunc-
tive  relief  to  ensure  that  those  companies  did  not  continue  to  violate  the  law.  At 
the same time, these actions put industry on notice of how the Commission was ap-
plying the laws it enforces to subprime lending and servicing practices. For example, 
in  FTC  v.  Associates  First  Capital,  Inc.,  the  FTC  challenged  as  deceptive  a  large 
subprime mortgage lender’s practice of including single-premium credit insurance in 
loans without disclosing its inclusion to consumers.1 After the defendants agreed to 
pay  $215  million  in  consumer  redress  to  settle  this  and  other  allegations,  major 
subprime lenders discontinued the sale of such insurance. 

Focusing  on  law  enforcement  has  enabled  the  agency  to  challenge  practices  as 
they are discovered and as they change. Based on that law enforcement experience, 
we  found  that  those  practices  varied  from  case  to  case,  and  over  time.  In  contrast 
to  law  enforcement,  the  Commission’s  rulemaking  procedures  are  burdensome  and 
time-consuming,  making  it  difficult  to  address  evolving  practices  in  a  timely  man-
ner. 

The Federal Reserve Board appears likely in the near future to issue comprehen-
sive  new  rules  under  the  Truth  in  Lending  Act  (‘‘TILA’’)  and  the  Home  Ownership 
Equity  Protection  Act  (‘‘HOEPA’’)  which  would  apply  broadly  to  subprime  loans; 
many of these rules would apply to all mortgage loans. If the Board’s rules are final-
ized, the Commission will have the authority to enforce those rules against nonbank 
entities under its jurisdiction. As with its current authority, the Commission intends 
to  use  that  new  authority  to  the  fullest  extent  possible  to  protect  consumers  in  the 
subprime mortgage market. I also anticipate that the FTC would carefully examine 
whether  additional  practices  are  unfair  or  deceptive  and  how  to  address  them,  in-
cluding  whether  to  use  its  current  or  any  new  rulemaking  authority  pursuant  to 
Senator  Dorgan’s  bill,  if  enacted.  The  Commission  would  make  this  determination 
in  light  of  the  types  of  practices  at  issue  and  balancing  the  resources  needed  for 
both law enforcement and any rulemaking. 

Question 2. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act gives pretty broad au-
thority to the FTC by prohibiting unfair methods of competition in or affecting com-
merce,  and  unfair  or  deceptive  acts  or  practices  in  or  affecting  commerce.  Section 
5  empowers  and  directs  the  FTC  to  prevent  persons,  partnerships,  or  corporations 
from using unfair methods and deceptive acts related to commerce. Certainly, much 
of  the  advertising  that  subprime  lenders  utilized  was  clearly  deceptive  and  mis-
leading  due  to  the  lack  of  helpful  information  disclosed  to  the  consumer.  The  FTC 
reauthorization  legislation  Senator  Dorgan  introduced  earlier  this  month  would  re-
quire  the  FTC  to  conduct  an  expedited  rulemaking  on  the  issue  of  subprime  loans 
and  unfair  or  deceptive  behavior  by  lenders.  Would  this  provision  be  helpful  to  the 
FTC  in  preventing  some  of  the  questionable  practices  and  advertising  that  led  to 
the subprime mortgage meltdown? 

Answer. As noted above, the Federal Reserve Board appears close to issuing com-
prehensive  new  rules  under  TILA  and  HOEPA  which  would  apply  broadly  to 
subprime  loans;  many  of  these  rules  would  apply  to  all  mortgage  loans.  The  pro-
posed  rules  address  underwriting  practices,  such  as  lending  not  based  on  ability  to 
pay  or  documented  income,  as  well  as  a  variety  of  additional  acts  and  practices  re-
lated  to  mortgage  appraisals,  servicing,  advertising,  and  disclosures.  If  the  Board’s

rules  are  finalized,  the  Commission  will  have  the  authority  to  enforce  those  rules 
against  nonbank  entities  under  its  jurisdiction.  As  with  its  current  authority,  the 
Commission  intends  to  use  that  new  authority  to  the  fullest  extent  possible  to  pro-
tect consumers in the subprime mortgage market. 

The Federal Reserve Board’s proposal is a comprehensive effort to address a wide 
range  of  mortgage  lending  acts  and  practices  that  may  cause  harm  to  consumers. 
Nevertheless,  we  recognize  that  inherent  in  the  promulgation  of  general  rules,  in-
cluding the FRB’s rules, is the risk that they could prove to be under-inclusive. The 
FTC  therefore  would  carefully  examine  whether  additional  practices  are  unfair  or 
deceptive and how to address them, including whether to use its current rulemaking 
procedures or any new streamlined rulemaking procedures permitted under Senator 
Dorgan’s  bill,  if  enacted.  The  Commission  would  make  this  determination  in  light 
of  the  types  of  practices  at  issue  and  balancing  the  resources  needed  for  both  law 
enforcement and any rulemaking. 

Question  3.  During  the  Commerce  Committee’s  FTC  reauthorization  hearing  on 
April 8, the FTC Commissioners stated that the Commission sent over 200 warning 
letters  to  mortgage  advertisers  and  the  media  outlets  that  carried  their  advertise-
ments  for  home  mortgages.  These  letters  stated  that  the  mortgage  advertisements 
identified  may  be  deceptive  in  violation  of  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act  or  may  violate 
the  Truth  in  Lending  Act.  Can  the  Commission  provide  an  update  as  to  how  many 
of  the  mortgage  advertisers  corrected  their  practices  and  stopped  employing  decep-
tive advertising? What action was taken to those lenders that continued their decep-
tive practices? 

Answer.  FTC  staff  recently  reviewed  current  solicitations  disseminated  by  those 
advertisers  who  received  warning  letters  in  September  2007.  Although  many  have 
corrected their ads, more than one-third still are disseminating advertising that po-
tentially violates the FTC Act and TILA in a manner identified by the initial warn-
ing  letters.  The  potential  violations  range  from  noncompliance  with  technical  as-
pects  of  TILA  to  potentially  false  representations  about  loan  products.  We  have 
opened investigations into several of the most egregious violations. In total, the FTC 
has  more  than  a  dozen  ongoing  nonpublic  investigations  of  home  mortgage  compa-
nies  for  potential  deceptive  advertising  practices  and  violations  of  the  Truth  in 
Lending Act (‘‘TILA’’). 

Question  4.  Ms.  Parnes  testimony  states  that  ‘‘The  FTC’s  enforcement  efforts 
would  be  more  effective  if  civil  penalties  were  available  against  nonbank  entities 
within  the  FTC  jurisdiction  who  violate  the  rules.’’  What  type  of  civil  penalties 
would  help  the  FTC  increase  the  effectiveness  of  its  enforcement  against  non-bank 
lenders  which  violate  the  rules?  How  would  additional  civil  penalties  increase  the 
effectiveness  of  FTC  enforcement  over  non-bank  lenders?  What  is  the  reason  that 
the FTC can not use these types of civil penalties against non-bank lenders? 

Answer. Under its current authority, the FTC is not authorized to seek civil pen-
alties  for  violations  of  TILA  and  HOEPA.  The  Commission  can  seek  other  types  of 
monetary  relief,  including  consumer  redress  and  other  equitable  remedies  such  as 
disgorgement  of  ill-gotten  gains,  from  defendants.  However,  in  some  cases,  restitu-
tion  or  disgorgement  may  not  be  appropriate  or  sufficient  remedies,  or  may  be  dif-
ficult  to  prove.  For  example,  it  may  be  difficult  to  determine  or  quantify  the  con-
sumer  injury  or  disgorgement  amount  that  would  be  appropriate  to  remedy  certain 
advertising or disclosure violations. Civil penalties for violations of the Board’s pro-
posed  rules  would  enable  the  Commission  to  better  achieve  the  law  enforcement 
goal of deterrence. 

The  type  of  civil  penalties  that  would  help  the  FTC  increase  its  effectiveness  are 
those that the Commission can currently obtain for violations of its trade regulation 
rules under Section 5(m)(1) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(m)(1). This provision pro-
vides a maximum civil penalty of $10,000 per violation per day, as adjusted by infla-
tion  to  $11,000.  This  civil  penalty  could  be  incorporated  by  stating  in  the  language 
of a bill that the FTC has the power to enforce the provisions of TILA and HOEPA 
in  the  same  manner  as  if  the  violation  had  been  a  violation  of  a  Commission  trade 
regulation rule.
