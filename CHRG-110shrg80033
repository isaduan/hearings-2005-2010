PENDING  CORPORATE  AVERAGE  FUEL 

ECONOMY  (CAFE)  LEGISLATION 

THURSDAY,  MAY  3,  2007 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  3:02  p.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Daniel  K.  Inouye, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

The CHAIRMAN. Today’s witnesses have been invited to comment 
on  S.  357,  the  Ten-in-Ten  Fuel  Economy  Act,  a  bill  to  improve  the 
Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy  Program  that  was  introduced 
earlier  this  session  by  Senators  Feinstein,  Snowe,  and  Inouye,  as 
well  as  five  other  members  of  the  Committee.  A  number  of  other 
Senators on the Committee have introduced or cosponsored legisla-
tion  to  improve  CAFE  standards,  including  the  Vice  Chairman, 
Senator Stevens. I’ve asked the witnesses to be prepared to discuss 
all the bills pending before the Committee. 

Increasing  CAFE  standards  is  both  a  national  security  and  eco-
logical  imperative.  The  issue  is  not  simply  that  the  United  States 
is  dependent  on  foreign  oil  imports,  but  that  it  imports  a  substan-
tial portion of these imports from areas that are politically unstable 
and could become hostile to America overnight. It is in our national 
security interest that Congress takes practical steps now to reduce 
our dependence on foreign oil. 

In  addition,  car  exhaust  is  a  major  contributor  to  global  warm-
ing.  By  increasing  fuel  efficiency,  we  can  decrease  the  amount  of 
carbon  dioxide  released  in  the  atmosphere,  and  slow  the  harm  to 
the planet. 

I  believe  that  everyone  here  shares  the  dual  desire  of  improving 
our  environment  and  strengthening  our  national  security  through 
decreasing  our  dependence  on  oil,  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing 
from  our  expert  panel  about  the  best  way  to  achieve  these  goals. 

May I call upon my Vice Chairman? 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator  STEVENS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  calling  this 
hearing  today.  I  think  it’s  important,  and  look  forward  to  hearing 
our colleagues, so I’ll be very short.

The  issue  of  fuel  economy  of  our  cars  and  light  trucks  is  signifi-
cant  as  our  country  faces  an  increasing  energy  crisis.  And  I  think 
since  September  11,  the  need  for  us  to  reduce  our  dependence  on 
foreign  oil  increases.  I’m  not  going  to  talk  about  ANWR  today,  so 
you can forget about that—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator STEVENS.—for a while, that is. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator STEVENS. As the Chairman said, I introduced legislation 
in  January  to  address  conservation,  and,  with  it,  a  reduction  in 
greenhouse  gas  emissions.  As  the  impacts  of  climate  change  are 
more  evident  in  Alaska  than  anywhere  in  the  country,  this  bill 
would provide authority to the Department of Transportation to re-
form  the  passenger  car  fleet  fuel  economy  program  and  set  an  ag-
gressive target for the passenger car fleet by 2017. 

Since then, I have worked with the Chairman and his staff to try 
to  develop  an  approach  that  would  not  only  advance  our  national 
security interest in reducing dependence on foreign oil sources, but 
also  an  approach  that  will  avoid  unintended  consequences  that 
would  adversely  impact  the  domestic  auto  industry  and  consumer 
choice. It’s my hope that I will be able to join the Chairman in in-
troducing his bill. 

I still am worried about how to deal with light trucks. These are 
extremely important to the West, and particularly important to my 
state.  So,  I  want  to  continue  to  work  with  my  good  friend  on  that 
portion of the bill, but I do hope that today’s hearing will be helpful 
in advancing the Committee’s progress. 
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
The CHAIRMAN. Well, thank you, sir. 
Senator Kerry? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS 

Senator  KERRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you.  Thanks  for  having 

this hearing. Thank our colleagues for coming and testifying. 

We’ve been at this for a long time on this Committee and in the 
Congress.  I  think,  since  1985,  at  the  27  mile  per  gallon  limit.  We 
really  haven’t  made  any  progress.  In  fact,  we’ve  gone  backward  in 
some areas. 

I see we are going to hear from Alan Reuther, and I welcome him 
here.  And  I’ve  talked  to  a  lot  of  folks  in  the  auto  industry  over 
these  last  years,  and  all  of  us  want  a  strong  domestic  auto  indus-
try. All of us want cars made in America, and we want Americans 
to  buy  American  cars.  And  we  want  our  workers  to  be  producing 
them,  as  much  as  possible.  So,  we’re  sensitive  to  that  need  as  we 
think about this. 

But there’s a convergence of two major issues here, and we need 
to  figure  out  what  the  best  approach  is  going  to  be.  One  is  obvi-
ously  oil  dependency  and  energy  dependency  itself—independence. 
And  the  other  is  global  climate  change  and  emissions.  And  one  of 
the  questions  we  need  to  examine  here  today  is  which  is  the  right 
standard  or  is  there  a  mix  of  a  standard,  because  part  of  the—I 
mean,  there  are  many  experts  who  are  convinced  that  what  we  do 
at the—in the tailpipe, and—that the mileage is not, in fact, going

to liberate America with respect to fuel, but, on the other hand, it’s 
the CO2 emissions that are perhaps the larger concern, and wheth-
er that might not be more of the focus in the context of our overall 
approach. 

So,  I  think  there  are  a  lot  of  issues  on  the  table.  I’m  glad  we’re 

going to have this hearing. I think it’s a very important one. 

I  do  note,  as  I  will  in  the  question  period,  that,  you  know,  De-
troit,  at  one  point,  was  producing  a  terrific  electric  car.  And  it 
stopped.  I’ve  driven  in  that  car.  It’s  a  superb  car.  And  I  think  the 
question has always been open, why it stopped. 

The  other  day,  I  visited  a  car  here  in  Washington,  just  outside 
the  Russell  Building,  which  is—it  happens  to  a  Prius,  unfortu-
nately—but  it  had  a  battery  conversion,  which  is  available  in  the 
market  today,  a  retro-conversion,  and  it  gets  150  miles  to  the  gal-
lon.  The  average  commute  of  Americans  is  40  miles.  And  batteries 
have  the  capacity  today  to  take  people  those  40  miles.  So,  there’s 
a  serious  question  here  about  why  these  kinds  of  technologies  and 
opportunities aren’t being grabbed more rapidly, and why we aren’t 
producing those. And I look forward to exploring those today. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Klobuchar? 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  holding  this 

hearing. And thank you, to my colleagues, for being here. 

I  come  from  Minnesota,  where,  I  have  to  tell  you,  in  the  last 
year,  there  has  just  been  more  and  more  focus  on  trying  to  make 
our country more energy independent. And I think some of it comes 
from people who live in rural areas, who are trying to fill up their 
tanks with gas, and find out it’s so expensive, they can only fill up 
half  a  tank,  or  it’s  kids  worrying  about  penguins  drowning,  or  it’s 
people  putting  their  fish-houses  out  and  realizing  that,  you  know, 
they’re  having  to  put  it  out  a  month  later  than  they  ever  used  to 
do. 

And  so,  it’s  really—the  climate  change  issue  has  gone  from  just 
a—something that scientists are talking about and writing about in 
reports, to real people wanting real changes. And it’s about climate 
change,  but  it’s  also  about  the  cost  of  oil.  We’re  spending  over 
$200,000 a minute on foreign oil in this country. And it’s also about 
our national security. 

And, I think, for the first time, the people in this country are see-
ing  it  themselves,  and  I  think  they’re  way  ahead  of  where  we  are 
in  Washington,  in  terms  of  getting  laws  passed.  And,  like  Senator 
Kerry, I’m very concerned that we’ve been going backward. The ef-
ficiency  of  the  American  car  and  truck  is  at  its  lowest  level  in  20 
years.  And  that’s  why  I’m  very  glad  that  we’re  holding  this  hear-
ing. I see this as potential jobs for our rural areas, if we can move 
more to biodiesel and ethanol, as well as better for our climate and 
better for our national security.

STATEMENT OF HON. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would—with  consent,  I 

would like to submit a statement for the record. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  I  would  say  that  I  think  the  challenge  we 
have is trying to respond to two issues. One is global warming, and 
the  other  is  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil.  And  I  think  sometimes 
when  we  try  to  mix  the  two,  and—we  are  not  as  disciplined  as  we 
should  be  about  making  sure  that  everyone  understands  what 
we’re doing, what we’re trying to get at, whether we’re trying to get 
at global warming or whether we’re trying to get at dependence on 
foreign oil. And, in both issues, I think we have to be doing things 
legislatively  that  most  effectively  do  both.  And  so,  I  think  it’s  im-
portant we stay focused on that as we look at the legislation that’s 
pending. 

I also think it’s very important that we make sure that we move 
forward  on  getting  more  fuel  efficiency  at  the  same  time  we  don’t 
penalize  American  manufacturers.  And  so,  the  devil  is  in  the  de-
tails  and  how  we  get  to  those  places,  and  I  look  forward  to  hope-
fully  finding  the  right  way  that  accomplishes  all  of  the  goals  I’ve 
talked about. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
[The prepared statement of Senator McCaskill follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI 
Thank you Mr. Chairman, 
This  is  a  very  difficult  decision  I  have  to  make.  On  the  one  hand  I  believe  that 
this  Committee  and  this  Congress  have  an  obligation  to  do  everything  necessary  to 
help curb our dependence on foreign oil not only for the purpose of our national se-
curity,  but  also  to  address  global  climate  change.  On  the  other  hand,  we  also  have 
an obligation to the hundreds of thousands of workers who manufacture automobiles 
and  automobile  parts  in  the  U.S.,  thousands  of  those  workers  are  located  in  my 
home  state  of  Missouri.  We  must  do  everything  necessary  to  protect  not  only  these 
workers,  but  perhaps  even  more  importantly,  the  550,000  retirees  and  their  fami-
lies.  Candidly,  they  are  potential  victims  that  could  be  devastated  by  the  lack  of 
foresight  by  American  car  manufacturers.  And  these  manufacturers  must  be  forced 
to face the future responsibly. 

Additionally, we must not lose sight on the fact that this is only one small portion 
of  a  larger  portfolio  of  problems  related  to  global  climate  change  and  energy  inde-
pendence.  We  must  make  sure  that  we  do  not  continue  to  put  the  onus  on  one  in-
dustry. This is a challenge that should be borne by many. 

In  the  end,  I  think  this  bill  is  a  good  start.  But  there  is  still  a  lot  of  work  to  be 
done,  much  of  which  lies  outside  the  confines  of  this  Committee’s  jurisdiction. 
Therefore, I cannot support this bill in its present form. I do, however, look forward 
to  working  with  the  Committee  and  other  Senators  to  craft  comprehensive  legisla-
tion that will move us closer to our goals of energy independence, start to slow glob-
al  climate  change,  and  protect  the  thousands  of  Americans  jobs  that  are  at  stake. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Lautenberg? 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
Holding this hearing is really important and a timely thing, and 
I  thank  you  for  doing  it.  But  I  want  to  look  at  the  unvarnished 
truth about where we are. 

America’s  current  fuel  economy  standards  are  insufficient  and 
are  hurting  our  natural  world.  Our  standards  contribute  to  global 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:03 Mar 21, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80033.TXT JACKIE

5 

warming  by  letting  too  much  greenhouse  gas  into  the  air.  And 
these gases are already harming our planet. 

The average global temperature in 2006 was 2.2 degrees warmer 
than the average temperature during the 20th century. And it’s not 
an  anomaly,  this  is  a  recurring  fact.  The  last  seven  5-year  periods 
were the warmest 5-year periods on record. And we can trace some 
of  these  directly  to  the  tailpipes  of  our  cars  and  trucks,  because 
that’s where one-third of America’s greenhouse gases come from. 

Well,  if  we  want  to  reduce  global  warming,  then  we’ve  got  to 
begin  to  act  now  to  cut  the  emissions  coming  from  our  vehicles. 
And  I’m  pleased  that  there  seems  to  be  consensus  in  this  Com-
mittee  that  we  should  act  to  increase  our  country’s  fuel  economy. 
We  lag  behind  the  rest  of  the  world  in  the  fuel  economy  of  our 
cars.  And  I  want  to  just  have  a  chart  shown  here  for  a  moment. 
The  one  that  says  that  we’ve  been  at  the  same  standard  since— 
somebody  help  him,  please—since  2002.  We  were  at  the  lowest 
level  then,  and  we  continue  to  be  at  a  lower  level  far  more  than 
we  were  before.  And  as  that  chart  shows,  Japan  is  leading  the 
world  at  fuel  economy,  at  more  than  40  miles  a  gallon.  Now  look 
at the United States. We are way behind. Our passenger cars have 
been  regulated  at  27  and  a  half  miles  per  gallon  since  1990,  and 
our  light  trucks  are  just  at  21.6  miles  a  gallon.  We  can,  and  we 
must, do better. 

Time  to  improve  our  fuel  economy  and  tackle  global  climate 
change.  And  I  believe  that  we  have  the  ability,  with  our  manufac-
turers, to rise to the challenge. And I sure hope that, working with 
this Committee and the Senate on this issue, we can do better. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Carper? 

STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS R. CARPER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM DELAWARE 

Senator CARPER. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
I want to thank our colleagues for coming by to—listening to our 

Sitting right behind Senator Feinstein, in the—two rows back, is 
Dave  McCurdy,  with  whom  I  once  served  in  the  House  of  Rep-
resentatives—in  fact,  someone  with  whom  a  number  of  us  once 
served—and  he  now  is—heads  up  the  Auto  Alliance.  He’s  going  to 
be one of our witnesses. 

I remember, I joined the House in the beginning of 1983. I think 
it was, maybe, 8 years after CAFE was first enacted, if my memory 
is  correct.  And  at  the—for  most  of  the  time  that  I  was  in  the 
House, the time I was Governor, and the time I’ve been in the U.S. 
Senate,  we’ve  heard  from  our  friends,  and  they  really  are  friends, 
within the auto industry, the domestic auto industry—we’ve heard, 
‘‘Don’t do anything further on CAFE, because if you do, it will cost 
us market share. Don’t do anything more on CAFE, because if you 
do,  we  will  lose  money.  Don’t  do  anything  more  on  CAFE,  because 
if  you  do,  we’ll  be  forced  to  close  plants.  Don’t  do  anything  more 
on CAFE, because if you do, we’re going to have to lay off employ-

opening statements.

Senator  CARPER.  And  we  look  forward  to  listening  to  yours  in

ees.’’ And, really, for pretty much the last 25 or so years, we’ve not 
touched CAFE. And over the last 25 years, actually—especially the 
last  10  years,  the  last  several  years—we  have  seen  the  Big  Three 
lose  market  share,  we  have  seen  the  Big  Three  lose  money,  close 
plants, and lay off a lot of employees. And all the time, we’ve been 
trying  to  protect  them  from  the  evils  of—or  the  problems,  or  the 
challenges  posed  by  changing  our  approach  to  CAFE.  There’s  an 
irony  there.  And  it’s  one  that’s  not  lost  on  us.  And  I  would  say  to 
our friends from the auto industries, ‘‘If you come to us looking for 
us  to  do  not  much  on  CAFE,  we  listen  to  those  arguments  with  a 
bit of skepticism. While we still love you, and we do; while we want 
you to be successful, and we still do; we need to do something.’’ 

I  sat  here  next  to  Senator  McCaskill,  and  I  said,  ‘‘Have  I—did 
I  miss  your  opening  statement?’’  And  she  says,  ‘‘I’m  not  going  to 
give one.’’ And then she turned around and gave my opening state-
ment. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator CARPER. And the points that—among the points that she 
made,  there  are  three  things  that  we—I  think  we  need  to  accom-
plish.  One  is  to  reduce  the  amount  of  oil  that  we  consume,  espe-
cially  that  which  is  derived  from  foreign  sources,  and  we  have— 
we’re too heavily dependent on them. We all know that. Second, we 
need  to  improve  our  air  quality,  and  we  need  to  reduce  the  threat 
of  global  warming,  climate  change.  And,  third,  we  need  to  do  the 
first  two  without  further  undermining  the  competitiveness  of  our 
auto industry. 

And  I  think  we  also  need  to  remember  that  reducing  fuel  use  in 
pollution  involves  addressing  more  than  just  auto  efficiency,  but 
also  the  availability  of  cleaner  fuels  and  reducing  fuel  use  by  pro-
viding some alternatives to driving, get us out of our cars. 

Over the last 6 years or so, we’ve had similar contentious debate 
over  regulating  CO2 emissions  from  utilities.  And  I,  along  with 
some of my colleagues, including Senator Feinstein and others here 
at the dais, took the approach that we should set a goal, and then 
lay  out  steps  for  reaching  that  goal.  And  what  we’ve  done  in  some 
of  our  legislation  is  to  say  we  want  to  reduce  CO2 emissions  from 
utilities by some 20–25 percent by a date certain, while increasing 
the  cost  of  electricity  by  just  a  little.  And  I  would  suggest  to  my 
colleagues we may want to take a similar approach with respect to 
CAFE. 

And the last thing I would say is, I think we ought to set achiev-
able  steps  that  might  require  CAFE  improvements  slowly  at  first, 
ramp  up  over  time,  and  there  should  be  credits  for  early  action, 
and  maybe  provide  some  off-ramps  in  case  we,  in  Congress,  set 
some  goals  that  are  not  technologically  feasible.  And  we  should 
support  attribute-based  standards  that  are  sensitive  to  varying 
fleet mixes between different manufacturers. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’ll  put  a  state-

ment in for the record, that’s a longer statement. 

Thank you for having the hearing. 
I  hope  today  we  hear  as  much  about  flex-fuel  cars  as  we  hear 
about  CAFE.  I  plan  to  offer  some  language  on  that  if  we  go  to  a 
markup on legislation regarding fuel efficiency. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARIA CANTWELL, U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Introduction 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  very  much  appreciate  you  holding  this  hearing  today  on  what  I  believe  is  an 
absolutely  vital  effort  to  tackle  one  of  the  preeminent  problems  facing  our  nation— 
our over reliance on oil. I look forward to hearing from today’s witnesses and mark-
up of our bipartisan bill next Tuesday. 
Facing a Very Challenging Energy Situation 

I think every member on this Committee, and hopefully the entire Congress, real-
izes that we are facing a very challenging energy situation. We are just a major hur-
ricane,  or  turmoil  in  a  major  oil  producing  nation,  or,  god  forbid,  some  terrorist  at-
tack or accident that takes part of our energy infrastructure out of commission, from 
energy prices spikes that could stop our economy cold. And that’s in the short-term. 
Looking  even  a  few  years  out—I  am  concerned  if  we  stay  on  the  path  we  are  on, 
if  we  don’t  challenge  Americans  to  work  together  and  harness  our  innovative  spirit 
and  ingenuity,  we  are  headed  for  years  of  crippling  high  energy  costs  and  a  severe 
global warming crisis. 

That would mean continued distortions to our foreign policy objectives, oil compa-
nies  continuing  to  reap  exorbitant  profits,  and  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  more 
would be drained from the pocketbook of American families to the Middle East and 
other nations that don’t necessarily have our interests at heart. 
We Must Make Our Tranportation System More Productive 

I know that’s a future we all want to avoid. But the only way to really tackle the 
problem,  the  only  way  to  start  really  improving  our  energy,  environmental,  and 
homeland  security  is  to  make  our  transportation  system  more  efficient  and  enable 
it to run on alternatives to petroleum. 

I  believe  the  key  to  this  strategy  is  making  our  cars  and  light  trucks  go  farther 
for  each  gallon  of  fuel  we  buy,  and  create  new  markets  for  alternatives  to  gasoline 
and diesel. 
An Announcement of Intention to Offer Flex Fuel Amendment 

As several witnesses noted in their prepared testimony, biofuels are a particularly 
promising  clean-burning  alternative  fuel.  But  despite  considerable  government  and 
public support to date, their growth has been hampered by the classic ‘‘chicken-and- 
egg’’ dilemma. 

Farmers  don’t  want  to  start  growing  biofuel  feedstocks  if  they  aren’t  sure  there 
will be a market. Entrepreneurs don’t want to invest in biofuel processing facilities 
if there aren’t any feedstocks. Car manufacturers don’t want to build many flex fuel 
vehicles  if  there  isn’t  any  biofuel  being  produced  or  places  where  people  can  get  it. 
And  gas  stations  don’t  want  to  put  in  biofuel  pumps  if  there  aren’t  any  cars  that 
can use them. 

Well  as  many  of  my  fellow  members  of  the  Energy  Committee  can  attest,  yester-
day  we  took  an  important  step  forward  on  one  aspect  of  this  dilemma  by  passing 
out  a  bill  that  significantly  increases  the  Renewable  Fuels  Standard  to  36  billion 
gallons by 2022. 

But  that  just  deals  with  the  supply  part.  On  the  demand  side  we  need  to  put  in 
requirements to ensure a minimum amount of biofuel infrastructure and then allow 
the market to grow from there. 

Today,  almost  all  the  cars  on  our  roads  can  only  use  up  to  10  percent  ethanol, 
meaning  all  together  they  can  only  utilize  around  15  billion  gallons  of  ethanol. 
That’s  why  we  need  make  sure  there  are  enough  flex  fuel  capable  vehicles—that  is 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:03 Mar 21, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80033.TXT JACKIE

8 

cars able to use either petroleum or biofuels or any mix in between to absorb billions 
of more gallons of biofuels required under any RFS increase and we need boost the 
number and distribution of pumps to deliver the fuels. 

That’s  why  I  plan  to  introduce  an  amendment  on  Tuesday—based  on  legislation 
I  introduced  last  Congress  with  24  other  cosponsors—that  would  require  a  certain 
percentage of vehicles sold in the U.S. be flex fuel capable, as well ensure the avail-
ability of a minimum number biofuel pumps. 
Need for Government Leadership 

History  proves  how  effective  Congressional  action  in  this  area  can  be.  Following 
the  first  oil  embargo  in  the  1970’s—by  the  same  Middle  Eastern  countries  who  we 
are  even  more  dependent  on  today—Congress  legislated  the  CAFE  program  as  one 
of  the  least  controversial  provisions  of  the  Energy  Policy  and  Conservation  Act  of 
1975. 

Thirty  years  ago,  this  body  heard  many  of  the  same  warnings  we  are  hearing 
today.  We  heard  that  fuel  economy  standards  will  render  this  Nation’s  auto  manu-
facturers extinct, that it will cost thousands of jobs, that it will reduce vehicle safe-
ty.  But  the  94th  Congress  rejected  those  erroneous  claims  and  passed  a  visionary 
law that was in the best interests of our Nation. 

The record affirms their foresight. In the decade following enactment, our Nation 
doubled  the  fuel  economy  of  our  Nation’s  passenger  vehicles.  Those  savings  mean 
that  today  our  Nation  is  importing  nearly  three  million  barrels  per  day  less  than 
we would have without the 1975 legislation. Put another way, American consumers 
are avoiding paying for an amount of oil equivalent to what we today import annu-
ally from the entire Persian Gulf. 
Conclusion 

Now once again Congress is in a position to take action and moves things forward. 
I  am  proud  to  be  a  cosponsor  of  Senator  Feinstein’s  Ten-in-Ten  Fuel  Economy  Act 
along with the Chairman and several members of this Committee because I believe 
that it takes the right approach. 

Mr.  Chairman,  now  is  the  time  to  provide  the  leadership  on  this  issue  that  has 

been missing for the last 20 years. 

Simply put, improving the fuel economy of our Nation’s vehicles is the easiest and 
most cost-effective way to reduce our Nation’s vulnerability to oil supply shocks and 
dependence on unfriendly regimes. 

I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  witnesses  and  working  with  my  Committee  col-
leagues to endorse and act on the numerous security, environmental, and consumer 
benefits that increasing the efficiency of our Nation’s transportation system. 

Thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Dorgan? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, Thank you very much. 
I  won’t  prolong  this  at  great  length,  but  I—I  mean,  cars  have 
changed—our vehicles have changed dramatically. We have heated 
seats and iPod docks and never-lost navigation and keyless entries, 
and  what  a  wonderful  thing,  but  one  thing  that  hasn’t  changed 
very  much  is  efficiency.  It  just  hasn’t.  And  70  percent  of  the  oil 
that  we  use—nearly  70  percent—goes  for  our  transportation  fleet. 
I  was  one  of  those  who  said,  ‘‘Let’s  have  NHTSA  figure  this  out.’’ 
The fact is, they haven’t, and they won’t. 

I  have  introduced,  as  you  know,  a  piece  of  legislation  called  the 
SAFE Act, which would establish efficiency standards. I don’t think 
it’s  an  end-all  or  be-all  to  talk  about  efficiency  of  vehicles.  There’s 
so  much  else—so  many  other  things  we  need  to  do.  But  we  can’t 
move forward any longer without dealing with this. We suck about 
85  million  barrels  of  oil  out  of  this  planet  every  day,  and  we  use 
a  little  over  20  million  barrels  of  it  here  in  this  country.  Seventy 
percent  of  that  is  for  transportation.  We  can’t  continue  to  look  the

9 

other  way  when  it  comes  to  the  question  of  making  these  vehicles 
more efficient. 

One  final  point.  We  looked,  recently,  at  a  vehicle  that  we  pur-
chased  10  years  ago,  at  the  new  version  of  that  vehicle.  Ten  years 
later,  the  mileage  on  the  window  sticker  was  identical  to  what  it 
was 10 years ago. And they say, ‘‘Well, the car’s more efficient, be-
cause it’s heavier.’’ Oh, yes? Well, it is still using the same amount 
of  petroleum,  isn’t  it?  I  mean,  there’s  no  efficiency  in  the  mileage 
standards. 

We need to do something. And I appreciate very much your hear-
ing,  and  I  hope  that  the  markup  next  week  can  be  productive,  as 
well.

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Senator NELSON. Mr. Chairman, I can sum it up. Increased mile-
age  equals  increased  national  security  through  increased  energy 
independence, and that means that we have a better chance of sav-
ing our planet. That’s my summary. 

I’m  a  cosponsor  of  Senator  Feinstein.  She  goes  to  35  miles  per 

gallon. I think it ought to go to 40.

The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, so ordered. 
Senator BOXER. Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Boxer follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA 
Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this important hearing today. 
The  United  States’  dependence  on  oil  has  grave  environmental,  geopolitical,  and 

environmental consequences. 

Raising Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards is a meaningful way 
to  help  reduce  our  country’s  unhealthy  dependence  on  oil  and  thereby  minimize  its 
negative  consequences.  I  have  long  been  an  advocate  for  boosting  the  CAFE  stand-
ards that auto manufacturers must meet. 

There is available and proven technology to produce vehicles that are fuel-efficient 
while  also  being  safe  and  featuring  excellent  performance.  Increasing  CAFE  stand-
ards will ensure that more such vehicles are available on the market. 

One  key  benefit  of  increased  use  of  fuel-efficient  vehicles  is  environmental.  With 
all the gasoline we consume in this country—over nine million barrels per day—we 
are  polluting  the  air  we  breathe,  and  contributing  to  global  warming.  Transpor-
tation accounts for one-third of our annual emissions of carbon dioxide pollution. 

Another advantage of placing an increased number of fuel-efficient vehicles on the 
market, as would occur with higher CAFE standards, is a decreased dependence on

10 

foreign  countries  for  our  country’s  energy  needs.  Sixty  percent  of  our  oil  consump-
tion  is  from  imports.  This  dependence  on  foreign  oil  is  a  national  security  liability. 
Finally,  maximizing  the  use  of  fuel-efficient  vehicles  on  America’s  roads  will 
translate to a reduced demand for gasoline, which should cause prices to ease. Gaso-
line  prices  this  week  are  unusually  high  for  this  time  of  year:  $2.97  per  gallon  na-
tionwide, and $3.36 in California. Since Americans consume so much gasoline, high 
prices  take  a  bite  out  of  the  budgets  of  both  individuals  and  business  owners,  and 
are a drag on the economy that we cannot afford. 

When you add together the all the environmental, geopolitical, and economic costs 
of America’s oil dependence, it is obvious that we need auto manufacturers to start 
giving us more fuel-efficient vehicle options. 

It is also important that our Federal Government leads by example when it comes 
to  fuel-efficient  vehicles.  That  is  why  I  reintroduced  a  bill  this  year  that  would  en-
sure  that  cars  purchased  and  leased  by  the  Federal  Government  for  the  Federal 
fleet are the most fuel-efficient possible. 

Each  year,  the  Federal  Government  purchases  more  than  60,000  passenger  vehi-
cles.  Unfortunately,  the  average  fuel  economy  of  the  new  gasoline-powered  vehicles 
acquired for the fleet in 2005 was an abysmal 21.4 miles per gallon. 

That  is  pathetic  when  there  are  hybrid  cars  on  the  market  that  can  achieve  over 

50 miles per gallon. 

I  drive  a  Toyota  Prius  and  can  attest  that  there  is  no  loss  of  performance  associ-

ated with vehicles that get great fuel economy. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  look  forward  to  the  Committee  voting  on  this  important  issue 

next week and hope that we can see action on the floor soon. 

The CHAIRMAN. And now I’ll call upon the panel of experts, poli-

ticians. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator LOTT. Expert politicians? 
Senator LEVIN. Do you want to bypass us altogether? 
[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. May I first recognize Senator Levin? 

STATEMENT OF HON. CARL LEVIN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN 

Senator  LEVIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  let  me  thank  you  and  the  mem-

bers of the Committee for holding this hearing. 

It’s  a  very  important  hearing,  for  all  the  reasons  that  you’ve 
given.  I  don’t  think  there’s  anybody  in  this  room  that  does  not 
share  the  thoughts  that  have  been  expressed  by  every  member  of 
this  Committee,  in  terms  of  the  need  to  address  the  problems  of 
global  warming,  particularly,  and  the  threat  of  imported  oil.  And 
the real question is, how do you go about that in a way, hopefully, 
which  can  also  support  American  manufacturing,  which  has  been 
hit  hard  by  a  lot  of  causes,  some  of  which  are  their  own  making, 
but  many  of  which  are  because  they’re  operating  in  a  global  econ-
omy, where other countries support their manufacturing. Our com-
panies  are  not  competing  with  foreign  companies,  they’re  com-
peting with foreign countries. When it comes to currency manipula-
tion,  when  it  comes  to  restrictions  on  our  exports,  when  it  comes 
to joint R&D projects with other countries, we are in a competition 
against other countries, not just against other companies. 

I  believe  the  way  that  we  can  reduce  the  use  of  oil  and  gasoline 
is  by  leap-ahead  technologies.  And  the  CAFE  system  is  a  poor  al-
ternative  to  investing  in  those  leap-ahead  technologies.  The  CAFE 
system, if you get to a 4 percent increase over the number of years 
you’re  talking  about,  will  produce  a  minute  improvement  in  the 
amount of CO2. 

We  have  a  chart  here,  which  will  show  you  that  improvement. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:03 Mar 21, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80033.TXT JACKIE

11 

If you can get to the back charts first. 
I  want  to  first  show  you  the  amount  of  CO2 currently  going  into 

the air. 

The other one. 
This  is  the  current—the  blue  box  is  the  current  amount  of  CO2 
production  in  the  world,  the  U.S.  contribution.  And  I  think  copies 
of  this  may  be  in  front  of  each  of  you.  The  U.S.  contribution  is 
about  a  fifth,  21.8  percent.  The  transportation  percentage  of  that 
is 6.8 percent. The passenger vehicle and light truck part of trans-
portation, it’s only—it’s two-thirds of that, so you’re at 4.2 percent. 
That’s  the  passenger-vehicle  and  light-truck  contribution  to  world 
CO2 production, that lower yellow box. 

Now,  if  you  adopt  the  proposed  CAFE  change,  and  achieve  a  4 
percent  reduction  by  the  year  2030—OK,  this  is  with  a  4  percent 
increase in CAFE—this is what the reduction will be in carbon di-
oxide.  It’s  that  little  red  box  at  the  bottom.  That’s  what  will  be 
achieved. 

It’s  a—that  doesn’t  mean  we  shouldn’t  achieve  it,  by  the  way.  I 
think  we  can  do  a  lot  better  if  we  would  invest  in  the  leap-ahead 
technologies—the  fuel  cells,  the  plug-in  hybrids,  the  advanced  die-
sels—instead  of  going  the  CAFE  route.  We  can  do  better  than 
CAFE if we use the resources that we have to invest in leap-ahead 
technologies  instead  of  these  incremental  changes  that  are  very 
minute,  but  which  are  aimed  at  trying  to  meet  these  2  or  3  or  4 
percent  increases.  That’s  my  first  point.  Put  our  resources  where 
they  will  make  a  heck  of  a  lot  bigger  difference  than  that  minute 
difference that will be made by a 4 percent increase in CAFE. 

Now  I  want  to  address  Senator  Lautenberg’s  point.  You  put  up 
a chart, Senator Lautenberg, which shows that the Japanese fuel— 
that the fleet of Japanese vehicles are more efficient than our fleet. 
The  impression  that  is  created—and,  I  think,  erroneously—is  that 
Japanese  vehicles  are  more  fuel  efficient  than  ours.  And  they  are 
not. It’s an impression which is in the minds of a lot of people, but 
it  is  a  wrong  impression.  And  if  we’re  going  to  do  the  right  thing 
and not do harm needlessly and unfairly to an American industry, 
we  then  have  got  to  look  at  the  facts  relative  to  the  efficiency  of 
vehicles. 

First,  let  me  put  up  four  vehicles,  the  same  weight.  This  is  a 
minivan, and I’m going to just go through these very quickly. This 
is the fuel economy, same weight, a Buick Terraza, Dodge Caravan, 
Honda  Odyssey,  Nissan  Quest.  They’re  all  the  same  weight,  they 
all get the same miles per gallon. That is true across the fleet. The 
same  weight,  approximately—and  sometimes  exactly—the  same 
number of miles per gallon. 

Let  me  just  give  you  one  more  example  of  this.  The  Ford  Free-
style, 4,250 pounds, does better than the Toyota Highlander, 4,250 
pounds—2 miles per gallon better. 

I’m not trying to prove that American vehicles are more fuel effi-
cient  than  the  Japanese.  What  I  do  want  you  to  accept  as  a  fact 
is that Japanese and other vehicles, pound for pound, are no more 
fuel  efficient  than  American  vehicles.  Until  you  get  to  the  hybrid, 
obviously.  We’re  talking  about  comparing  98  percent  of  the  fleet. 
Hybrids  are  different,  and  that’s  why  we  should  focus  on  getting 
to the leap-ahead technologies. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:03 Mar 21, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80033.TXT JACKIE

12 

Instead of a CAFE system which discriminates against American 
vehicles,  because,  historically,  that  system  is  based  on  the  entire 
fleet,  and,  when  the  fleet  has  concentrated  on  the  larger  cars  in-
stead of smaller, historically, which have been in demand in Amer-
ica,  those  companies  which  have  produced  a  larger  percentage  of 
smaller vehicles have room to sell all the larger vehicles they want. 
It’s  perverse.  It  works  against  American  jobs,  with  not  a  darn  bit 
of  benefit  to  the  air.  It  doesn’t  do  the  environment  one  bit  of  good 
for  Toyota  to  be  able  to  sell  more  and  more  Highlanders,  but  Ford 
not to be able to sell Freestyles, because they bump up against the 
CAFE  limit.  It  doesn’t  do  the  air  any  good.  It  doesn’t  do  the  envi-
ronment any good. And it hurts American jobs. 

So,  our  plea,  my  plea,  is  that  whatever  system  you  put  in  place, 
eliminate the discriminatory features of the CAFE system. And the 
way  to  do  that  is  to  have  the  same  miles  per  gallon  based  on  the 
same size or class. Do this by class, not by fleet. 

And  I  want  to  commend  Senator  Feinstein.  In  her  bill,  the  first 
part  of  her  bill  does  that.  She  has  the  same  miles  per  gallon, 
class—not the same—she goes miles per gallon size—depending on 
the  size.  In  other  words,  class  by  class  by  class,  she  has  the  same 
miles  per  gallon  across  the  class,  and  does  not  impose  the  same 
standard  on  each  company,  even  though  their  fleets  are  designed 
so differently. 

And  I  want  to—I  want  to  just  point  that  out.  That  part  of  the 
Feinstein bill is an—a very significant improvement to avoid going 
by  the  entire  fleet,  and  to  do  this  class  by  class,  so  that  the  High-
lander  and  Freestyle  class  will  be  treated  the  same  way.  And  the 
discrimination in that regard will end. 

Now,  we  can  argue  whether  CAFE  makes  sense  or  if  you  want 
to  go  leap-ahead  versus  incremental.  That’s  an  argument  which,  it 
seems  to  me,  is  an  important  argument.  You  can  do  a  lot  better  if 
you  get  companies  to  commit  to  use  their  research  and  develop-
ment  dollars  on  leap-ahead  technologies.  Sign  agreements  with 
companies  to  invest  in  the  leap-ahead  technologies,  the  way  we’ve 
done, as I understand, in a number of other areas. 

However,  if  you’re  going  to  go  CAFE,  follow  the  approach  that 
Senator  Feinstein  has  used  in  the—going  by  class,  rather  than  by 
company fleet. 

However—and I want to end with this—there is language—there 
is  language  in  the  Feinstein—I  want  to—I  just  want  to  read  one 
thing,  from  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  before  I  change  my 
point.  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  in  2002,  made  the  exact 
point that I just made, and I want to read it to you, ‘‘A policy deci-
sion  to  simply  increase  the  standard  for  light-duty  trucks  to  the 
same  level  as  passenger  cars  would  operate  in  this  inequitable 
manner.  Some  manufacturers  have  concentrated  their  production 
in  light-duty  trucks,  while  others  have  concentrated  production  in 
passenger  cars.  But  since  trucks  tend  to  be  heavier  than  cars,  and 
are  more  likely  to  have  attributes,  such  as  4-wheel  drive,  that  re-
duce fuel economy, those manufacturers whose production was con-
centrated  in  light-duty  trucks  would  be  financially  penalized  rel-
ative to those manufacturers whose production was concentrated in 
cars.  Such  a  policy  decision  would  impose  unequal  costs  on  other-
wise similarly situated manufacturers.’’

The National Academy of Sciences has it right. And, by the way, 
I believe that Senator Carper made the same point, that we ought 
to go attribute-based, as he put it which means by class, which es-
sentially  means  by  size,  rather  than  by  going  company  fleet  by 
company fleet. 

Now,  there’s  other  language  in  here—I  will  close—there’s  other 
language in the Feinstein bill which some have interpreted—and I 
believe, now, erroneously interpreted—that goes in the opposite di-
rection  and  would  require  NHTSA  to  set  for  each  company  a  com-
bined car and truck standard of 35 miles per gallon by 2019. Such 
a  requirement  would  exacerbate  the  discriminatory  impact  of  the 
current  CAFE  system  and  hurt  our  American  manufacturers  dis-
proportionately, because they have a higher percentage of trucks in 
their overall fleet. 

And now, I want to just state this very carefully, so this part I’m 

going to read. 

‘‘I  discussed  this  matter  yesterday  with  Senator  Feinstein  and 
her  staff,  and  conferred  further  with  the  Commerce  Committee 
staff  as  to  the  intent  of  the  language  in  setting  a  combined  stand-
ard  of  35  miles  per  gallon  by  2019.  I  was  reassured  to  learn  that 
the intent of S. 357 is not to set a combined standard for each com-
pany,  but,  rather,  to  set  a  number  globally  across  the  entire  fleet 
of new vehicles sold in the U.S., and to give NHTSA the discretion 
to  achieve  that  number  by  setting  fuel  economy  standards  using 
different  attributes  for  different  classes  of  vehicles.’’  Senator  Car-
per’s  point.  ‘‘The  intent  of  that  language,  in  S.  357,  in  my  judg-
ment, needs to be clearer in order to avoid worsening the discrimi-
natory  impacts  of  the  CAFE  system;  that  is,  the  intention  of  this 
bill is to give NHTSA the flexibility to meet the industry-wide fuel 
economy  number,  taking  into  consideration  both  technological  fea-
sibility,  the  size  and  weight  of  different  types  and  classes  of  vehi-
cles,  and  the  differences  in  each  manufacturer’s  overall  fleet  mix.’’ 
‘‘The  goal  of  CAFE  reform  through  a  class-based  standard  is  an 
important advance and must not be set back or reversed by a com-
bined standard.’’ 

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Levin follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. CARL LEVIN, U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN 

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  today  to  testify  on  the 

Corporate Average Fuel Economy bills pending before your Committee. 

As  temporary  stewards  of  the  planet,  we  all  need  to  be  conscious  of  our  impact 
on  the  global  environment  and  take  actions  to  address  our  dependence  on  oil  and 
our contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. 

As  Chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Armed  Services,  I  am  also  very  conscious  of 
the  effects  of  our  continued  reliance  on  oil  that  comes  from  unstable  regions  of  the 
globe.  I  am  also  concerned  that  global  climate  change  may  present  new  security 
challenges  in  some  of  the  most  volatile  regions  of  the  world.  I  believe  that  we  can 
address  both  of  these  challenges,  but  I  also  believe  that  there  are  ways  of  doing  it 
that boost American manufacturing. 

America  has  lost  3  million  manufacturing  jobs  since  2001,  over  200,000  jobs  in 
the automotive sector. Our companies face enormous competition in the global mar-
ketplace  without  sufficient  support  from  the  U.S.  Government.  Our  companies  are 
not  just  competing  against  other  global  companies—they  are  competing  against 
other governments that strongly support their manufacturing sectors with currency 
manipulation  and  trade  barriers  against  our  products.  American  companies  must 
compete  against  those  who  are  protected  from  import  competition  by  their  govern-

14 

ment,  have  cheap  labor  costs,  do  not  pay  health  insurance  and  legacy  costs,  or  do 
not  have  to  meet  our  strict  environmental  standards.  Our  manufacturers  can  com-
pete  with  anyone  on  a  level  playing  field  but  right  now  that  field  is  tilted  against 
them. 

We  can  reduce  our  dependence  on  oil,  reduce  our  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and 
improve  the  overall  fuel  economy  of  our  vehicles  on  the  road  while  supporting  our 
American  manufacturers  in  the  global  market  place.  To  do  that,  we  need  a  major 
public-private  partnership  and  major  investments  in  leap-ahead  energy  tech-
nologies, including advanced technology vehicles. We need a massive infusion of re-
sources  and  a  commitment  from  both  the  private  sector  and  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  to  support  efforts  to  reach  these  important  goals.  In  other  words,  we  need  a 
comprehensive  American  Manufacturing  Initiative.  But  at  a  minimum,  we  cannot 
have  our  government  act  in  ways  that  will  unfairly  disadvantage  our  American 
manufacturers against their global competitors. 

In the area of autos specifically, it would be better for our resources to be invested 
in  leap-ahead  advanced  vehicle  technologies  rather  than  in  the  incremental  ap-
proach  to  vehicle  fuel  economy  improvement  that  the  CAFE  regulatory  scheme  re-
quires. To the extent that the constrained R&D resources of our manufacturers are 
used  on  incremental  improvements  in  current  technology,  it  limits  their  ability  to 
commit  those  R&D  resources  to  advanced  leap-ahead  technologies.  Better  those  re-
sources be invested in big leaps ahead, such as advanced hybrids and advanced bat-
teries,  hydrogen  and  fuel  cells,  advanced  clean  diesel,  and  alternative  fuel  tech-
nologies  such  as  biofuels.  One  way  to  accomplish  that  would  be  to  have  companies 
commit a certain amount of money for R&D on these technologies as an alternative 
to the incremental approach of CAFE. 

The current CAFE system is also an example of where our own regulatory scheme 
has  discriminated  against  American  manufacturers.  There  is  a  common  misconcep-
tion that Japanese vehicles are more fuel-efficient than American cars. That simply 
is  not  the  case.  Pound  for  pound,  the  vehicles  are  the  same.  The  Japanese  vehicles 
are no more fuel-efficient than ours. 

CAFE has historically been built around the average fuel economy of manufactur-
er’s total fleet of cars or light trucks. Because American manufacturers have histori-
cally  offered  more  full-sized  vehicles,  they  have  typically  had  a  lower  fleet-wide  av-
erage  fuel  economy  than  their  foreign  competitors.  Even  when  individual  American 
models  have  fuel  economy  performance  equal  or  superior  to  comparably-sized  for-
eign models, the ‘‘product mix’’ of the American manufacturers has produced a lower 
‘‘fleet average.’’ 

Under  the  perverse  logic  of  the  CAFE  system,  therefore,  an  American  manufac-
turer  of  a  full-size  pickup  truck,  such  as  the  GM  Silverado,  which  gets  18  miles  to 
the  gallon,  is  constrained  in  how  many  of  these  pickup  trucks  it  can  sell  and  still 
meet the overall CAFE fleet average requirement, which is now 22.2 miles per gal-
lon. At the same time, CAFE allows a foreign manufacturer to sell several hundred 
thousand  more  comparable  pickup  trucks  that  get  16  miles  to  the  gallon.  This  is 
because  the  foreign  manufacturers  have  produced  more  small  vehicles  historically. 
In  essence,  a  foreign  manufacturer  has  more  ‘‘headroom’’  to  increase  its  market 
share  of  full-size  pickup  trucks,  without  any  requirement  to  increase  the  fuel  econ-
omy of these vehicles. 

There are numerous examples of similar size and weight vehicles, made by domes-
tic manufacturers and foreign manufacturers, all of which have the same fuel econ-
omy for the same size and weight. For instance, the Ford Freestyle small SUV gets 
23  mpg,  while  the  Toyota  Highlander  small  SUV  gets  21  mpg.  Both  are  the  same 
size  and  weight—4,250  pounds.  The  Chevy  Suburban  and  the  Toyota  Sequoia  are 
both  large  SUVs,  and  both  weigh  5,500  pounds—the  Suburban  gets  17  mpg  while 
the  Sequoia  gets  16  mpg.  One  last  example—four  different  minivans,  made  by  four 
different manufacturers, each of which weighs 4,750 pounds, and each gets 21 mpg. 
In  2002,  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  recognized  these  inherently  discrimi-
natory  features  of  CAFE,  stating  the  following  in  its  report,  the  Effectiveness  and 
Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards. 

One concept of equity among manufacturers requires equal treatment of equiva-
lent vehicles made by different manufacturers. The current CAFE standards fail 
this test. 
If one manufacturer was positioned in the market selling many large passenger 
cars  and  thereby  was  just  meeting  the  CAFE  standard,  adding  a  22-mpg  car 
(below  the  27.5-mpg  standard)  would  result  in  a  financial  penalty  or  would  re-
quire  significant  improvements  in  fuel  economy  for  the  remainder  of  the  pas-
senger cars. But, if another manufacturer was selling many small cars and was

15 

significantly exceeding the CAFE standard, adding a 22-mpg vehicle would have 
no negative consequences. 
A  policy  decision  to  simply  increase  the  standard  for  light-duty  trucks  to  the 
same  level  as  for  passenger  cars  would  operate  in  this  inequitable  manner. 
Some  manufacturers  have  concentrated  their  production  in  light-duty  trucks 
while  others  have  concentrated  production  in  passenger  cars.  But  since  trucks 
tend  to  be  heavier  than  cars  and  are  more  likely  to  have  attributes,  such  as 
four-wheel drive, that reduce fuel economy, those manufacturers whose produc-
tion  was  concentrated  in  light-duty  trucks  would  be  financially  penalized  rel-
ative  to  those  manufactures  whose  production  was  concentrated  in  cars.  Such 
a  policy  decision  would  impose  unequal  costs  on  otherwise  similarly  situated 
manufacturers.’’ 

Over  many  years,  CAFE  has  allowed  an  unfair  competitive  advantage  to  foreign 
vehicle  manufacturers,  without  improving  our  fuel  economy  or  reducing  CO2.  Pro-
posed increases in CAFE would barely make a dent in CO2 emissions, while, if done 
in  a  discriminatory  way,  could  do  huge  damage  to  American  jobs.  It  could  also  be 
a  step  back  on  environmental  improvement  if  American  manufacturing  is  sent  to 
countries with less stringent environmental standards. 

If  we  must  have  a  CAFE  system,  then  it  needs  to  be  significantly  revamped  so 
that it is not discriminatory against our companies, and the numbers should be set 
in  a  non-discriminatory  way  by  experts  who  understand  what  can  and  cannot  be 
done  from  a  technology  standpoint.  We  need  to  give  this  authority  to  the  National 
Highway Transportation Safety Administration, or NHTSA, and give them the tools 
to  set  standards  in  a  way  that  treats  manufacturers  fairly  and  ensures  sufficient 
lead time to get new technologies into the market. NHTSA should be given the au-
thority  to  set  standards  by  class  for  passenger  cars  as  they  have  done  for  light 
trucks.  It  would  also  promote  leap-ahead  technologies  instead  of  incremental 
changes  if  NHTSA  is  clearly  authorized  to  set  a  five-year  CAFE  number  instead  of 
an incremental annual approach, using a CAFE system based upon attributes, such 
as size or weight. 

In  her  bill,  S.  357,  Senator  Feinstein  provides  authority  for  NHTSA  to  set  sepa-
rate  standards  for  different  classes  of  passenger  automobiles.  NHTSA  already  has 
that  authority  for  light  trucks.  That  is  an  important  and  positive  step  forward  in 
terms of fairness to our American manufacturers. 

There is other language included in S. 357, however, that some have interpreted— 
erroneously,  I  now  believe—to  go  in  the  opposite  direction  and  require  NHTSA  to 
set  for  each  company  a  combined  car  and  truck  standard  of  35  mpg  by  2019.  Such 
a  requirement  would  exacerbate  the  discriminatory  impacts  of  the  current  CAFE 
system and hurt our American manufacturers disproportionately because they have 
a higher percentage of trucks in their overall fleet. 

I  discussed  this  matter  yesterday  with  Senator  Feinstein  and  her  staff,  and  con-
ferred  further  with  the  Commerce  Committee  staff  as  to  the  intent  of  the  language 
in  setting  a  combined  standard  of  35  mpg  by  2019.  I  was  reassured  to  learn  that 
the intent of S. 357 is not to set a combined standard for each company, but rather 
to set a number globally across the entire fleet of new vehicles sold in the U.S. and 
to give NHTSA the discretion to achieve that number by setting fuel economy stand-
ards  using  different  attributes  for  different  classes  of  vehicles.  The  intent  of  that 
language  in  S.  357  needs  to  be  clearer  in  order  to  avoid  worsening  the  discrimina-
tory impacts of the CAFE system, i.e., that the intention is to give NHTSA the flexi-
bility to meet an industry-wide fuel economy number, taking into consideration both 
technological  feasibility,  the  size  and  weight  of  different  types  and  classes  of  vehi-
cles, and the differences in each manufacturer’s overall fleet mix. The goal of CAFE 
reform through a class-based standard is an important one and must not be set back 
or reversed by a combined standard. 

I  want  to  emphasize  again  that  I  support  improvements  in  fuel  economy,  and  I 
fully  support  efforts  in  this  Congress  to  reduce  our  dependence  on  oil  and  reduce 
our greenhouse gas emissions. I believe it is our duty to future generations. 

But it is important to recognize where U.S. auto emissions fit into the overall pic-
ture. World CO2 production is 28 billion metric tons. The U.S. contribution is 6 bil-
lion metric tons, or 21.8 percent of world production. U.S. transportation contributes 
6.8  percent  of  the  world  production,  and  U.S.  passenger  vehicles  and  light  trucks 
contribute 4.2 percent of world CO2 production. The U.S. passenger vehicle contribu-
tion  to  world  emissions  is  less  than  one-fifth  of  the  U.S.  contribution.  Therefore, 
CAFE can make but a small contribution to the overall reduction in CO2 production. 
That should not stop us from making improvements in our vehicle technologies, but 
it should drive us to solutions that can give us the greatest bang for the buck.

We  all  want  to  reduce  carbon  dioxide  emissions  from  vehicles,  but  we  need  to  do 
it in a way that is fair to all manufacturers and in a way that unleashes great tech-
nological advances in vehicles. We can make leaps ahead in hydrogen use; in hybrid 
use,  including  plug-in  hybrids;  and  biofuels.  We  need  to  focus  on  these  leap-ahead 
technologies and give the incentives to manufacturers to develop and move to those 
technologies. If we focus instead only on CAFE as the main mechanism for CO2 re-
ductions, we will miss an opportunity to do real good and might do real harm. Our 
manufacturing sector in America has been damaged already. We must, therefore, be 
doubly  cautious  about  further  disadvantaging  our  American  manufacturers  by  pur-
suing the wrong approach. 

I  am  committed  to  work  with  this  Committee  and  others  in  the  Congress  to  de-
velop the right approach to improving fuel economy, reducing our dependence on oil, 
and reducing our contribution to global climate emissions. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Feinstein? 

STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA 

Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
I  was  very  heartened  to  hear  the  comments  of  the  Senator  from 
Michigan,  and  very  much  appreciative  of  them.  We  did  work  to-
gether yesterday. His staff—my staff did meet with your staff, who 
helped draft this section. And so, I think the intent is clear. 

I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for being an original cospon-
sor of this bill, along with Senators Snowe, Durbin, Kerry, Senator 
Boxer,  Senator  Nelson,  who’s  here,  Cantwell,  Lautenberg, 
Lieberman,  Menendez,  Collins,  Reed,  Leahy,  Sanders,  Dodd,  and 
Akaka. 

The  thrust  of  this  bill  would  raise  CAFE  standards  to  35  miles 
per  gallon  by  model  year  2019.  This  is  essentially  a  40  percent  in-
crease  over  10  years.  Similar  increases  are  contained  in  virtually 
every  CAFE  bill  proposed  this  year,  including  bills  offered  by  Sen-
ator Dorgan and Craig, and by Senators Obama and Lugar. 

In  the  President’s  State  of  the  Union  speech,  he  set  a  goal  for 
America  to  conserve  up  to  8  and  a  half  billion  gallons  of  gasoline 
through  better  fuel  economy  by  2017.  Now,  what  would  it  take  to 
achieve  this  goal?  An  increase  in  fuel  economy  for  cars  and  trucks 
of  about  4  percent  per  year,  which  is,  again,  in  line  with  our  bill. 
Now,  we  all  know  what’s  causing  the  remarkable  agreement  on 
how  much  we  can  accomplish  through  CAFE  legislation.  And  the 
simple  truth  is  this:  national  security  imperatives,  global  warming 
concerns,  and  public  opinion  are  all  aligned  in  favor  of  a  cleaner 
fleet. The devil’s in the details of how we get there. 

By  2025,  this  simple  step  would  reduce  emissions  of  greenhouse 
gases from United States cars and light trucks by 18 percent below 
projected  levels,  the  equivalent  of  taking  50  million  of  today’s  cars 
and  light  trucks  off  the  road  in  1  year.  As  I  think  Senator  Boxer 
knows, and others know on this Committee, the transportation sec-
tor  is  responsible  in  this  country  for  about  33  percent,  or  a  third, 
of  global  warming  gases.  Of  that  33  percent,  the  passenger  and 
light truck part of the transportation industry is about 25 percent. 
So, that’s what we have. 

The  bill  would  save  2.1  million  barrels  of  oil  per  day,  or  nearly 

the amount of oil we import today from the Persian Gulf. 

The  Ten-in-Ten  bill  is  also  fair,  as  I  think  Senator  Levin  stated, 
to  the  domestic  auto  industry.  Detroit  has  suggested  that  the  bill 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:03 Mar 21, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80033.TXT JACKIE

17 

would  require  each  manufacturer  to  produce  vehicles  averaging  35 
miles  per  gallon.  In  other  words,  General  Motors,  Toyota,  and 
Honda would all have to make enough high-mileage cars for model 
year  2020  to  offset  their  low-mileage  light  trucks  and  average  35 
miles per gallon. 

However,  as  Senator  Levin  just  pointed  out,  this  is  not  the  way 
this bill works. Instead, it is the entire nationwide fleet of cars and 
light  trucks  sold  in  this  country  that  must  average  the  35  miles. 
NHTSA  will  set  size-based  mileage  standards  dependent  on  the 
mix  of  vehicles  in  the  entire  U.S.  fleet.  Companies  that  manufac-
ture  mostly  larger  vehicles  will  only  have  to  meet  lower  mileage 
standards for these vehicles. To be sure, every type of vehicle, from 
the  smallest  to  the  largest,  will  have  to  improve  its  mileage  to  the 
extent possible. 

Critically, as Senator Levin stated, the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration, NHTSA, will retain the discretion to decide 
the  most  appropriate  combination  of  mileage  improvements  for 
each vehicle class that will get the nationwide average to 35 miles 
per  gallon.  So,  it  can  be  class-by-class.  Neither  American  nor  for-
eign manufacturers will be especially advantaged or disadvantaged. 
Each  manufacturer  will  have  to  improve  the  vehicle  it  makes  to 
meet the standards that the agency sets. 

This bill, I deeply believe, is fair to all American manufacturers, 
and  it  is  also  fair  to  the  car-buying  public.  Some  have  expressed 
concerns  that  drivers  would  have  to  choose  between  fuel  efficiency 
and  acceleration,  safety,  or  space.  But  experts  at  the  National 
Academy  of  Sciences  have  shown  that  we  can  increase  the  fuel 
economy  of  mid-sized  SUVs  to  35  miles  per  gallon;  large  cars,  to 
39  miles  per  gallon;  minivans,  to  nearly  37  miles  per  gallon,  and 
large  pickups,  close  to  30.  This  is  the  NAS  report  of  2002,  pages 
41, 45, at tables 3 and 4. 

If you average the improvements that the National Academy con-
siders  achievable  over  the  next  decade  for  these  different-sized 
classes  of  passenger  cars  and  light  trucks,  you  can  actually  get  to 
37 miles per gallon for the U.S. fleet, even better than the 35 miles 
per  gallon  required  in  this  Ten-on-Ten  bill.  The  source  of  this  is  a 
Union  of  Concerned  Sciences  analysis  of  the  NAS  study  based  on 
the 2005 sales mix. 

So,  all  of  this  can  be  done,  we  believe,  without  sacrificing  per-

formance or safety. 

In  conclusion,  the  average  fuel  economy  of  new  vehicles  sold 
today  is  lower  than  it  was  two  decades  ago.  That  goes  to  some  of 
the comments made by members of this Committee. 

The Ten-in-Ten bill, I think, offers a straightforward and sensible 
solution.  One,  it  can  be  done  with  existing  technology.  Two,  it 
would satisfy the public’s desire for a more fuel-efficient fleet. And, 
third,  it  would  reduce  carbon  emissions  and  limit  America’s  reli-
ance on foreign oil. 

In 1963, President Kennedy set a national goal of putting a man 
on  the  Moon  within  the  decade.  Technology,  paired  with  American 
ingenuity and hard work, achieved this historic objective. 

Today,  we’re  advocating,  certainly,  a  less  lofty  goal,  raising  fuel 
economy standards by 40 percent over the next decade. And I think 
it, too, can become a reality.

To  both  Senator  Levin  and  Senator  Stabenow,  I’m  certainly  pre-

STATEMENT OF HON. DEBBIE STABENOW, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN 

Senator STABENOW. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
And I want to also thank Senator Feinstein. She’s allowing us to 

surround her today. So—— 
Senator FEINSTEIN. Yes. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  STABENOW.—we  appreciate  that,  and  very  much  appre-
ciate,  Mr.  Chairman,  your  holding  this  hearing,  and  to  all  of  our 
colleagues. 

I don’t disagree at all about the importance of creating more fuel 
efficiency.  We’ve  got  to  decrease  our  reliance  on  foreign  oil.  It  is  a 
national security issue. We need to address, from an environmental 
standpoint, what’s happening. There’s no question in my mind that 
global  warming  is  real,  and  every  sector  of  the  economy  has  to  do 
its part. 

So,  for  me,  this  is  not  about  the  goals,  but  it  is  very  seriously 
about  how  we  achieve  it,  because  it  very  much  impacts  the  Amer-
ican  manufacturing  economy  and  jobs  if  we  don’t  get  it  right.  And 
so, that’s what I’m asking today. 

First,  though,  I  want  to  just  speak  a  moment  about  the  auto  in-
dustry, because I think it’s very important for us to recognize that 
our  American  auto  industry  really  helped  create  the  middle  class 
of  this  country  and  is  key  to  continuing  it.  This  isn’t  your  father’s 
factory anymore. This is high-tech manufacturing. And if you have 
not had an opportunity to visit a plant recently, we would welcome 
you to do so. It is extremely impressive. 

But, unfortunately, this industry has faced a lot of difficult chal-
lenges  right  now  that,  frankly,  have  nothing  to  do  with  quality  of 
the  vehicle  or  the  competitiveness  of  the  vehicles.  Unfair  trade 
practices,  like  currency  manipulation  and  counterfeiting;  rising 
healthcare  costs,  where  they  compete  with  other  companies  whose 
countries pay for the costs of those dollars of healthcare. GM, Ford 
and  DaimlerChrysler,  in  2005,  spent  $12.2  billion  on  healthcare, 
and  they  covered  2  million  Americans.  Experts  predict  that  future 
health liabilities for Detroit automakers range from anywhere from 
$70 billion to $140 billion. 

Now,  why  would  I  say  that  in  a  hearing  on  CAFE  and  on  the 
issue of increasing fuel efficiency? Because, frankly, every time one 
of  our  automobiles  adds  $1,435,  which  it  does,  on  average,  to  pay 
for healthcare, that’s not $1,435 that’s going into new technologies, 
all of which we want to have happen.

So,  this  is  connected.  What  is  happening  to  manufacturing, 
where  the  dollars  are  going,  is  all  connected.  And,  frankly,  I  want 
to free up those dollars so that we can put more of that into those 
technologies and where we want to go. 

Meanwhile, other countries are able to put their money into new 
technologies.  Just  to  give  you  an  example,  the  Governments  of 
Japan  and  South  Korea  are  spending  five  times  more  on  new  bat-
tery technologies. There’s something wrong when we see Ford, with 
the  Escape,  the  hybrid  using  battery  technologies,  by—having  to 
look  to  another  country  to  get  the  battery.  And  part  of  what  we’ve 
got  to  do  is  make  sure  whatever  incentives  we  do  are  creating  the 
jobs here, not just the new science and the new technology. 

But  Japan  invested  $50  million  last  year,  and  South  Korea  in-
vested $70 million, committed over the next 6 years. In comparison, 
our budget has $11 million, for one of the most critical technologies 
to doing what all of us want to do. 

And  I  believe  the  American  auto  industry’s  really  hit  twice,  be-
cause  we’re  not  investing  in  those  technologies,  we’re  not  address-
ing  competitiveness  costs,  and  we  regulate  our  automakers  in  dif-
ferent ways than their foreign competitors. 

I’m  here  today,  though,  not  to  say  we  should  do  nothing.  Far 
from it. In fact, we’ve got to move ahead, and we’ve got to be smart 
about  it,  and  we’ve  got  to  raise  the  bar,  in  terms  of  increased  fuel 
efficiency and technology innovations. 

Now,  let  me  speak  to  the  concerns  about  increasing  CAFE,  Mr. 
Chairman.  And  certainly  in  light  of  Senator  Feinstein’s  comments, 
I certainly appreciate that we’ve had some good discussion, and we 
can look at how we move so that these issues are addressed. 

But  there’s  no  question  that  a  fleetwide  average  does  not  in-
crease  fuel  efficiency,  as  Senator  Levin  said.  If  you  have—if  it’s 
company-by-company,  and  one  company  is  making  larger  vehicles, 
and the other, smaller, then the one making smaller cars can have 
a  lot  of  room  to  go  up  on  a  cap,  and  those  vehicles  don’t  have  to 
be  efficient.  Those  pickup  trucks  and  SUVs  don’t  have  to  be  effi-
cient, and you still don’t meet the cap. That’s not fair. 

In  the  United  States,  the  majority  of  our  jobs  are  coming  from 
those  pickup  trucks,  are  coming  from  trucks,  light  trucks,  SUVs, 
and  larger  vehicles.  And  so,  that  is  a  critical  issue  for  us  as  it  re-
lates to CAFE. 

And,  second,  I  would  argue  that  CAFE  creates  a  situation  of  in-
cremental  change  that  I  believe  is  slower  than  how  we  need  to  do 
this.  If  we  are  looking  at  something  year  to  year,  where—we’re 
looking at situation that forces the companies to look at short-term 
strategies,  not  investing  for  the  next  5  years,  but  looking  at  the 
weight of the car, the size of the engine, what’s involved in the ve-
hicle. It may mean as—cutting vehicles from the fleet. For those of 
us  that  produce  automobiles,  that  means  cutting  plants,  poten-
tially. It means limiting production of certain kinds of automobiles. 
And those are the kinds of things, in the short run—you can ad-
dress the weight or the size of the engine—but we need something 
bolder  than  focusing  on  these  short-term,  incremental  approaches 
to  increasing  fuel  efficiency.  And  that’s  what  I’m  most  concerned 
about.

Senator  Levin  talked  about  bold,  leap-forward  strategies.  And  I 
believe  that’s  exactly  what  we  need  to  do,  not  talking  about  4  per-
cent here or 6 percent there. We need to be looking at cutting-edge 
technologies that reach exactly what Senator Feinstein said. 

I  have  no  doubt  that  if  we  do  this  right,  and  we  can  set  a  re-
quirement  on  where  we  need  to  be.  And  if  we  boldly  invest  in  the 
technology, we can meet those numbers and surpass it. 

It’s a question of how we set it up and whether they’re forced to 

look at short-term strategies or longer-term strategies. 

And I also, Mr. Chairman, would have to say that we need to re-
member  that  our  automakers,  both  foreign  and  domestic,  have  al-
ready invested millions of dollars in developing cleaner, better tech-
nologies.  We  are  seeing  the  focus  on  the  electric  technology,  the 
Volt, by General Motors. And right now we’re—the key question is 
the  advanced  battery  technology  and  how  fast  we  can  get  this  to 
a  point  where  they  can  bring  it  to  market.  But  we  also  have  bio-
diesel,  and  DaimlerChrysler  focusing  on  important  efforts  that  re-
late  to  diesel,  clean  diesel—I  know  Senator  Carper  has  been  fo-
cused  on  that—and  biodiesel.  For  example,  with  new  technology, 
today’s  clean  diesel  engines  achieve  20  to  40  percent  better  fuel 
economy  than  the  equivalent  gasoline  engine.  And  over  a  lifetime 
of the vehicle, this is very, very significant. 

Just  as  an  example,  this  year  the  2007  Jeep  Cherokee  will  use 
418  fewer  gallons  of  gasoline  each  year  than  a  traditional  Jeep 
Cherokee.  And  we  want  all  of  them  to  do  that.  Also,  as  compared, 
for instance, to—a hybrid Honda Civic to a conventional Civic, that 
has a savings of about 154 gallons. 

If  we  have  all  new  Jeep  Cherokees  with  new  diesel  engines,  we 
would  save  23  million  gallons  of  gasoline  a  year.  And  they’re  mov-
ing  in  that  direction.  It’s  not  that  this  isn’t  happening.  That’s 
where they’re going. 

Another example is flex fuel vehicles. We all know about ethanol 
and  what  is  happening  there,  and  what  we  can  achieve,  and  what 
we  can  achieve  with  cellulosic  ethanol.  There  are  extraordinary 
things that are happening. Fueling half of the fleet by 2012, which 
is less than 5 years away, would save us 3.9 billion gallons of gaso-
line,  or  approximately  42  percent  of  our  2012  fleet’s  projected  an-
nual consumption of gas. Moreover, 77 million tons of carbon would 
be saved. And, frankly, that is more than what we’re talking about 
through  these  CAFE  standards.  There  are  bolder,  better,  bigger 
ways to get to where we want to go. 

And  so,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  say,  in  summary,  that  just  two 
new  technologies,  flex-fuel  vehicles  and  new  diesels,  together,  are 
on track to reduce American gasoline consumption by over 4 billion 
gallons of gasoline annually in less than 5 years. 

What  I  believe  our  challenge  is,  is  to  make  sure,  particularly  as 
it  relates  to  biofuels,  that  the  infrastructure  is  there,  and  that’s 
where many of us are working to make sure that it is. 

As a comparison, a CAFE increase would save just 2.8 billion, in-
stead of 4 billion, by focusing on a CAFE increase as has been tra-
ditionally structured. 

We  need  to  move  ahead  more  boldly.  We  have  many  committees 
that are working on this together, not only this distinguished Com-
mittee,  but  the  Finance  Committee,  where  we  are  focusing  on  tax

credits  and  incentives;  we  have  the  Energy  Committee,  that  re-
ported,  yesterday,  some  very,  very  positive  things,  a  new  require-
ment  to  reduce  America’s  gasoline  consumption  by  more  than  32 
million  gallons  per  year,  the  same  amount  of  ethanol  that  we  can 
help  produce  in  the  Agriculture  Committee  with  the  farm  bill, 
where we are also working; EPW, with Senator Boxer. We have the 
opportunity  to  work  together  to  do  what  I  believe  is  something 
very, very bold and also something very good for our economy, cre-
ating jobs. And I would urge us to look more broadly than just this 
one  strategy.  And  I  believe  we  can  get  there  faster  than  the  incre-
mental  change  that  has  been  the  type  of  change  in  the  structure, 
which started in the 1970’s—we’ve got a 1970’s structure of CAFE, 
and we’re in 2007, with a whole different set of challenges that are 
bigger  and  more  serious.  And  I  think  there’s  a  bigger,  bolder  way 
for  us  to  address  those,  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  the 
Committee. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Senator  Levin,  Senator  Feinstein,  Senator 

Stabenow, on behalf of the Committee, I thank all of you. 

Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  And  I  think  this  just  demonstrates  to  all  of  us 
that  the  forthcoming  debate  will  be  a  very  serious,  mature,  and 
productive one. 

Thank you very much. 
Senator  LEVIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  ask  consent  that  my  en-
tire—I would ask consent that my entire statement and an attach-
ment be made part of the record. 
The CHAIRMAN. It is so ordered. 
Senator LEVIN. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. And now, we will call upon the panel of experts: 
Mr. Alan Reuther, Legislative Director of the United Auto Workers 
International Union; Mr. David Friedman, Research Director of the 
Clean  Vehicles  Program  of  the  Union  of  Concerned  Scientists;  Ad-
miral  Dennis  Blair,  United  States  Navy  (Retired),  former  Com-
mander-in-Chief  of  the  United  States  Pacific  Command,  and  pres-

lege and Dickinson College; Mr. Michael J. Stanton, President and 
Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Association  of  International  Auto-
mobile Manufacturers; Vice Admiral Dennis McGinn (Retired); and 
Mr. David McCurdy, President of the Alliance of Automobile Manu-

May I first call upon Mr. Reuther. 

STATEMENT  OF  ALAN  REUTHER,  LEGISLATIVE  DIRECTOR, 
INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE 
&  AGRICULTURAL  IMPLEMENT  WORKERS  OF  AMERICA 
(UAW) 
Mr. REUTHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
My  name  is  Alan  Reuther.  I  am  the  Legislative  Director  for  the 
UAW. We appreciate very much the opportunity to testify today be-
fore this Committee on the subject of the pending CAFE legislation. 
For  several  reasons,  the  UAW  strongly  opposes  these  bills.  The 
auto  manufacturers  will  have  to  incur  enormous  retooling  costs  to 
achieve  the  fuel  economy  improvements  mandated  by  these  bills.

The  Bush  administration  has  estimated  that  GM,  Ford,  and 
DaimlerChrysler would have to spend $85 billion, or about 75 per-
cent,  of  these  costs.  The  UAW  is  deeply  concerned  that  the  mag-
nitude  of  these  costs  and  their  disproportionate  impact  on  GM, 
Ford,  and  DaimlerChrysler  would  inevitably  lead  to  calamitous  re-
sults in the auto industry. 

Unlike  their  competitors,  GM,  Ford,  and  DaimlerChrysler  are 
facing  extremely  serious  financial  situations.  In  the  past  2  years, 
they  have  posted  shattering  losses,  closed  numerous  facilities,  and 
downsized  their  workforces  by  almost  90,000  jobs.  At  the  same 
time,  GM,  Ford,  and  DaimlerChrysler  face  much  heavier  retiree 
health  legacy  cost  burdens  than  their  competitors.  GM  has  almost 
3  and  a  half  retirees 
for  every  active  worker.  Ford  and 
DaimlerChrysler  have  over  one  retiree  for  each  active  worker.  To-
gether,  these  three  companies  spend  over  $5  billion  each  year  to 
provide healthcare for 550,000 retirees and their families. 

Thus,  it  is  abundantly  clear  that  we  do  not  have  a  level  playing 
field  in  the  U.S.  auto  industry.  The  CAFE  increases  proposed  in 
the  pending  legislation  would  severely  aggravate  this  situation  by 
imposing  huge,  disproportionate  retooling  costs  on  GM,  Ford,  and 
DaimlerChrysler.  If  these  three  companies  are  forced  to  shoulder 
these  costs,  they  will  be  placed  at  a  further  competitive  disadvan-
tage.  Something  will  have  to  give.  The  most  likely  result  is  that 
they  will  be  forced  to  shutter  more  facilities,  destroying  jobs  for 
tens  of  thousands  of  additional  workers,  and  weakening  the  eco-
nomic  base  in  many  communities  across  this  country.  They  will 
also be pressured to reduce, or completely eliminate, retiree health 
insurance for their 550,000 retired workers and their families. 

UAW believes that this economic and human toll is unacceptable. 
Accordingly,  we  strongly  urge  this  Committee  to  reject  legislation 
requiring  drastic  increases  in  fuel  economy  unless  it  is  accom-
panied  by  measures  to  provide  assistance  to  the  struggling  auto 
manufacturers and to help level the playing field in the auto indus-
try. 

UAW is prepared to work with this Committee to develop mecha-
nisms, such as Federal loan guarantees, that can provide meaning-
ful assistance to the companies. 

The  UAW  is  also  concerned  about  structural  problems  in  the 
pending  CAFE  bills.  We  were  very  pleased  to  hear  the  discussion 
in  the  panel  before  us,  between  Senator  Feinstein  and  Senator 
Levin, that the intent of S. 357 is not to impose a flat 35 mpg fuel 
economy  requirement  on  the  combined  passenger  car/light  truck 
fleets  of  each  manufacturer,  but,  instead,  to  have  a  global,  indus-
trywide  target.  We  think  that’s  a  much  better  approach,  and  we 
look forward to working with the Committee to clarify the language 
in that regard. 

We  are  also  concerned  that  all  of  the  pending  CAFE  bills  would 
allow  NHTSA  to  promulgate  an  attribute-based  CAFE  system,  but 
do  not  contain  an  adequate  anti-backsliding  rule,  or  else  allow  for 
credit  trading  between  the  manufacturers.  As  a  result,  these  bills 
would  jeopardize  the  continuation  of  small  car  production  and  jobs 
in  the  United  States.  I  would  note  that  S.  357  does  attempt  to  do 
an anti-backsliding rule. We think, again, the language needs to be

clarified  so  it  has  the  intended  result,  and  that  we  don’t  lose  our 
small car production in this country. 

The  UAW  shares  the  growing  national  concerns  about  climate 
change  and  energy  security.  We  believe  the  best  approach  to  ad-
dress  these  problems  would  be  an  economywide  mandatory 
tradable  permits  program  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  In 
addition,  we  believe  Congress  should  establish  carbon  performance 
standards  to  require  reductions  in  the  carbon  emissions  of  light- 
duty vehicles, as well as reductions in the carbon intensity of fuels 
that go into those vehicles. 

We  also  support  other  initiatives  to  promote  the  use  of  alter-
native  fuels  in  motor  vehicles.  This  includes  mandating  that  cer-
tain percentages of all vehicles sold in the U.S. by each automaker 
must  be  flex-fuel  capable  by  specified  dates,  as  well  as  additional 
incentives or mandates relating to the conversion of filling stations 
so they have the capability to distribute alternative fuels. 

Finally, the UAW urges Congress to provide incentives to encour-
age  domestic  production  of  advanced-technology  vehicles  and  their 
key  components.  This  would  help  to  maintain  and  create  tens  of 
thousands  of  automotive  jobs  in  this  country.  At  the  same  time,  it 
would  help  to  accelerate  the  introduction  of  these  vehicles,  and, 
thereby,  reduce  global  warming  emissions  and  our  dependence  on 
foreign oil. 

In conclusion, the UAW appreciates the opportunity to testify be-
fore this Committee. We look forward to working with you and the 
entire  Senate  to  fashion  new  policies  that  will  enable  the  United 
States  to  make  significant  progress  in  reducing  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  and  oil  consumption  while  protecting  jobs  and  benefits 
for American workers and retirees. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Reuther follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ALAN REUTHER,  LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR,  INTERNATIONAL 
UNION,  UNITED AUTOMOBILE,  AEROSPACE &  AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS 
OF AMERICA (UAW) 
Mr.  Chairman,  my  name  is  Alan  Reuther.  I  am  the  Legislative  Director  for  the 
International  Union,  United  Automobile,  Aerospace  &  Agricultural  Implement 
Workers of America (UAW). The UAW represents over one million active and retired 
workers  across  the  country.  Many  of  these  UAW  members  work  or  receive  retire-
ment benefits from auto manufacturers and parts companies. The UAW appreciates 
the opportunity to testify before this Committee on the subject of pending Corporate 
Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) legislation. This includes the ‘‘Ten-in-Ten Fuel Econ-
omy  Act’’  (S.  357),  sponsored  by  Senator  Feinstein;  the  ‘‘Improved  Passenger  Auto-
mobile Fuel Economy Act of 2007’’ (S. 183), sponsored by Senator Stevens; the ‘‘Fuel 
Efficiency Energy Act’’ (S. 1118), sponsored by Senator Dorgan; and the ‘‘Fuel Econ-
omy Reform Act’’ (S. 767), sponsored by Senator Obama. 

The  UAW  strongly  opposes  these  CAFE  bills  for  several  reasons.  First,  we  are 
deeply concerned that the stringent fuel economy improvements mandated by these 
bills  would  impose  enormous  retooling  costs  on  the  auto  manufacturers.  GM,  Ford 
and DCX cannot afford these costs because of their serious financial conditions and 
large  retiree  health  care  legacy  costs.  The  net  result  is  that  the  bills  could  lead  to 
further  plant  closings  and  job  loss,  as  well  as  cut  backs  in  or  the  elimination  of 
health insurance coverage for 550,000 retirees and their families. 

Second, the CAFE increases in some of these bills contain severe structural prob-
lems. Imposing a much higher flat mpg requirement on the combined car and light 
truck  fleets  would  discriminate  against  auto  companies  whose  product  mix  is  more 
oriented  toward  light  trucks.  Furthermore,  authorizing  NHTSA  to  adopt  an  at-
tribute-based  CAFE  system  for  passenger  cars,  without  establishing  an  adequate

24 

anti-backsliding  rule,  would  jeopardize  small  car  production  and  jobs  in  the  United 
States. 

The UAW shares the growing national concerns about climate change and energy 
security. We believe these serious challenges can best be addressed through an econ-
omy  wide  cap-and-trade  program  that  limits  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  along  with 
additional  performance  standards  that  require  reductions  in  the  carbon  content  of 
fuels  and  improvements  in  vehicle  efficiency.  This  type  of  approach  can  also  help 
to provide various industries, including struggling auto manufacturers, with the re-
sources  needed  to  make  investments  in  the  advanced  technologies  that  will  provide 
significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and oil consumption. 
Economic Feasibility 

There  is  no  dispute  that  the  improvements  in  fuel  economy  mandated  by  the 
pending  CAFE  bills  would  necessarily  entail  enormous  retooling  costs  for  the  auto 
manufacturers. The Bush administration has estimated that to comply with a 4 per-
cent  rate  of  increase  in  the  CAFE  standards  that  would  save  8.5  billion  gallons  of 
oil by 2017, all of the automakers would have to incur retooling costs of $114 billion. 
However, these costs would not be distributed uniformly among the companies. GM, 
Ford  and  DCX  would  have  to  incur  $85  billion,  or  about  75  percent  of  these  costs. 
The  UAW  is  deeply  concerned  that  the  magnitude  of  these  costs,  and  their  dis-
proportionate impact on GM, Ford and DCX, would inevitably lead to calamitous re-
sults in the auto industry. GM, Ford and DCX are already facing extremely serious 
financial  situations.  In  the  past  2  years  they  have  posted  shattering  losses.  In  re-
sponse,  they  have  announced  unprecedented  plans  to  downsize  their  operations,  in-
volving  the  closing  of  numerous  automotive  facilities  and  buy-out  programs  that 
could  result  in  the  loss  of  almost  90,000  jobs.  Speculation  continues  about  further 
industry  restructuring  that  could  lead  to  even  more  plant  closings  and  job  loss.  In 
contrast, Japanese, German and Korean competitors have been making large profits 
and expanding their operations. 

At  the  same  time,  GM,  Ford  and  DCX  face  much  heavier  retiree  health  care  leg-
acy cost burdens than their competitors. GM has about 31⁄2 retirees for every active 
worker;  Ford  and  DCX  have  over  1  retiree  for  each  active  worker.  Together  these 
three  companies  spend  over  $5  billion  each  year  to  provide  health  care  to  about 
550,000 retirees and their families Many of these retirees are younger than 65, and 
thus  are  not  covered  under  Medicare.  In  contrast,  the  Japanese,  German  and  Ko-
rean operations in this country are relatively new, and thus have very few retirees. 
And  the  health  care  costs  from  facilities  in  their  home  countries  are  heavily  sub-
sidized through national health care systems. 

Thus,  it  is  abundantly  clear  that  we  do  not  have  a  level  playing  field  in  the  U.S. 
auto  industry.  The  CAFE  increases  proposed  in  the  pending  legislation  would  se-
verely  aggravate  this  situation,  by  imposing  huge,  disproportionate  retooling  costs 
on GM, Ford and DCX. 

The  stark  reality  is  that  GM,  Ford  and  DCX  do  not  have  the  ability  to  shoulder 
these additional, discriminatory costs. If they are forced to do so, they will be placed 
at a further competitive disadvantage. Something will have to give. The most likely 
result  is  that  these  companies  will  be  forced  to  shutter  more  facilities,  destroying 
jobs  for  tens  of  thousands  of  additional  workers  and  weakening  the  economic  base 
of  many  communities  across  this  country.  They  will  also  be  pressured  to  reduce  or 
completely  eliminate  health  insurance  coverage  for  their  550,000  retired  workers 
and their families. 

The  UAW  believes  that  this  economic  and  human  toll  is  unacceptable.  Accord-
ingly,  we  strongly  urge  this  Committee  and  Congress  to  insist  that  any  legislation 
requiring  improvements  in  fuel  economy  must  be  accompanied  by  measures  to  pro-
vide  assistance  to  struggling  auto  manufacturers  and  to  level  the  playing  field  in 
the  industry.  Because  none  of  the  pending  CAFE  bills  include  adequate  measures 
to achieve these objectives, the UAW urges you to reject these bills. 
Structural Problems in Pending CAFE Bills 

The UAW remains skeptical about the magnitude of the CAFE increases proposed 
in  the  pending  bills.  We  do  not  believe  the  study  by  the  National  Academy  of 
Sciences in 2001 supports increases of this magnitude. However, we also are deeply 
concerned about several structural problems in the pending CAFE bills. 

First,  the  ‘‘Ten-in-Ten  Fuel  Economy  Act’’  (S.  357)  would  combine  the  passenger 
car  and  light  truck  fleets  under  the  CAFE  program,  and  impose  a  flat  35  mpg  fuel 
economy  requirement  on  the  combined  passenger  car-light  truck  fleet.  This  is  often 
referred to as closing the ‘‘SUV loophole.’’ 

This approach would greatly increase the magnitude of the proposed fuel economy 
increase, since light trucks are starting from a lower base line. Even worse, this ap-

25 

proach  would  have  a  severe  discriminatory  impact  on  GM,  Ford  and  DCX,  because 
their product mix is much more oriented toward light trucks than other companies. 
In  effect,  GM,  Ford  and  DCX  would  be  required  to  make  their  passenger  car  fleets 
meet extremely high mpg standards in order to balance out their much larger fleets 
of  light  trucks.  Or,  they  would  be  forced  to  curtail  production  and/or  close  many  of 
their light truck operations. 

This problem is not ameliorated by the fact that S. 357 gives NHTSA the author-
ity  to  do  an  attribute-based  CAFE  program  for  passenger  cars,  as  well  as  light 
trucks.  This  bill  still  mandates  that  every  company  must  meet  the  flat  35  mpg 
standard  for  its  combined  passenger  car-light  truck  fleet,  and  thereby  imposes  a 
much larger burden on GM, Ford and DCX. 

The  UAW  submits  that  this  discriminatory  approach  is  fundamentally  unfair.  In 
our judgment, all companies should be required to improve the fuel economy of their 
entire  fleets  in  a  comparable  manner.  Fuel  economy  requirements  should  take  ac-
count of the significant product mix differences between the companies, so that any 
requirements  are  even  handed  and  do  not  impose  disparate  costs  and  technological 
burdens on certain companies. 

Second,  all  of  the  pending  CAFE  bills  would  allow  or  require  NHTSA  to  promul-
gate  an  attribute-based  CAFE  system  for  passenger  cars,  as  well  as  light  trucks. 
But  these  bills  do  not  appear  to  contain  an  adequate  anti-backsliding  rule,  or  else 
would  allow  credit  trading  between  manufacturers.  As  a  result,  these  bills  would 
jeopardize  the  continuation  of  small  car  production  and  jobs  in  the  United  States. 
Under  the  existing  passenger  car  CAFE  program,  the  combination  of  the  fleet- 
wide  averaging  and  the  two-fleet  (domestic  and  foreign)  requirements  ensures  that 
full line auto manufacturers must maintain small car production in North America. 
This  is  because  the  production  of  smaller,  more  fuel  efficient  vehicles  is  needed  to 
offset the production of larger, less fuel efficient vehicles. However, if NHTSA is au-
thorized  or  required  to  promulgate  an  attribute-based  CAFE  system  for  passenger 
cars, this would undermine the fleet-wide averaging requirement, and would there-
fore enable the auto manufacturers to offshore all of their small car production and 
jobs. 

Over  17,000  American  workers  are  currently  employed  in  five  U.S.  assembly 
plants  that  produce  small  passenger  cars.  This  includes  GM,  Ford,  DCX,  and 
NUMMI  plants  in  Lordstown  (OH),  Spring  Hill  (TN),  Wayne  (MI),  Belvidere  (IL), 
and  Fremont  (CA).  Almost  50,000  American  workers  produce  parts  for  these  vehi-
cles.  The  jobs  of  these  workers  would  be  directly  threatened  by  the  pending  CAFE 
bills  because  they  would  allow  or  require  NHTSA  to  promulgate  an  attribute-based 
system for passenger cars, and therefore would undermine the fleet wide averaging 
requirement.  The  loss  of  these  jobs  would  inevitably  have  a  negative  ripple  effect 
on the rest of the economy. 

As  the  UAW  has  previously  testified,  there  is  an  easy  way  to  obtain  the  benefits 
of moving to an attribute-based CAFE system for passenger cars, while avoiding the 
down  side  of  losing  our  small  car  production  and  jobs.  Specifically,  the  UAW  urges 
Congress  to  impose  an  ‘‘anti-backsliding’’  requirement  on  any  new  attribute-based 
CAFE  rules  that  NHTSA  would  be  authorized  or  required  to  promulgate  for  pas-
senger cars. This requirement should specify that both the domestic and foreign pas-
senger car fleets for each auto manufacturer would still have to meet or exceed the 
CAFE  standard  under  the  current  system  (i.e.,  the  27.5  flat  mpg  fleet  wide  stand-
ard).  To  be  effective,  this  ‘‘anti-backsliding’’  benchmark  must  be  increased  in  line 
with  the  overall  fuel  economy  improvements  required  under  any  attribute-based 
passenger car CAFE system. 

The  establishment  of  this  type  of  ‘‘anti-backsliding’’  requirement  would  prevent 
companies  from  offshoring  all  of  their  small  car  production  and  jobs.  It  also  would 
ensure  that  the  auto  manufacturers  cannot  subvert  the  objective  of  any  new  at-
tribute-based CAFE system by ‘‘up-sizing’’ many of their vehicles, resulting in worse 
overall fuel economy. 

Unfortunately,  S.  1118  does  not  contain  any  anti-backsliding  provision.  Although 
S.  357  and  S.  183  do  contain  versions  of  an  anti-backsliding  rule,  these  provisions 
are poorly drafted and would not be effective in protecting small car production and 
jobs.  Because  S.  357  combines  the  passenger  car  and  light  truck  fleets,  the  bench-
mark  set  forth  in  its  anti-backsliding  rule  is  set  too  low  to  be  effective.  Similarly, 
because S. 183 merely adopts the existing 27.5 mpg standard as the benchmark for 
its  anti-backsliding  rule,  and  does  not  increase  this  in  line  with  overall  improve-
ments in fuel economy, this also would not be effective. 

In  addition,  S.  357  and  S.  767  would  establish  a  ‘‘credit  trading’’  system  that 
would  allow  auto  manufacturers  to  buy  and  sell  CAFE  credits  for  passenger  cars 
and/or light trucks. This would also have the effect of undermining the two fleet rule 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:03 Mar 21, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80033.TXT JACKIE

26 

and/or  fleet  wide  averaging.  As  a  result,  it  would  inevitably  jeopardize  the  continu-
ation of small car production and jobs in this country. 

The  UAW  is  concerned  about  a  number  of  other  problems  in  the  pending  CAFE 
legislation. A number of the bills would expand the CAFE program to cover heavier 
vehicles  (above  8,500  lbs.),  thereby  substantially  increasing  the  stringency  of  the 
overall program and making it even more difficult and costly for the auto manufac-
turers  to  comply  with  the  proposed  standards.  Similarly,  S.  1118  would  eliminate 
the flex fuel CAFE credit. This also represents a back door means of increasing the 
stringency of the overall program, as well as the compliance costs for the companies. 
Both of these proposed changes in the CAFE program would have an especially neg-
ative  impact  on  GM,  Ford  and  DCX,  because  their  fleets  contain  more  heavier  and 
flex fuel vehicles. 

Two of the pending CAFE bills, S. 1118 and S. 767, would require the auto manu-
facturers  to  improve  the  fuel  economy  of  their  passenger  car  and  light  truck  fleets 
by  4  percent  per  year.  Although  the  bills  purport  to  give  NHTSA  the  discretion  to 
allow  a  more  reasonable  rate  of  increase,  the  findings  that  it  would  have  to  make 
in order to do this are so stacked that it would be impossible for the agency to ever 
make such a determination. In effect, the so-called ‘‘off-ramps’’ are illusory. 

Because of the foregoing structural problems in the pending CAFE bills, the UAW 
urges  the  Committee  to  reject  these  measures,  and  instead  to  explore  better  ap-
proaches  for  addressing  the  pressing  problems  of  climate  change  and  energy  secu-
rity. 
Need  for  Better  Approach  to  Reduce  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  and  Our 

Dependence on Foreign Oil 

The  UAW  shares  the  growing  national  concern  about  climate  change.  Scientific 
studies  have  confirmed  that  human  use  of  fossil  fuels  is  contributing  to  global 
warming.  These  studies  underscore  the  major  environmental  challenges  posed  by 
global warming, including rising sea levels, changes in climate patterns and threats 
to  coastal  areas.  To  avoid  these  dangers,  the  growth  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions 
must be reduced, and ultimately reversed. 

The  UAW  is  also  concerned  about  the  national  security  implications  of  our  Na-
tion’s dependence on foreign oil. Currently, 28 percent of the world’s oil is produced 
in the Persian Gulf. Although less than 11 percent of the oil used by the U.S. comes 
from this volatile region, disruptions in this oil supply can still create serious prob-
lems for our economy. As a result, in recent years our Nation has become entangled 
in  deadly,  costly  conflicts  in  the  Middle  East.  In  our  judgment,  the  long  range  eco-
nomic  and  national  security  interests  of  the  U.S.  would  better  be  served  by  imple-
menting policies to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 

The  UAW  believes  that  climate  change  and  energy  security  are  serious  problems 
that need to be addressed by Congress and the Bush administration. We urge Con-
gress to pursue initiatives that will deal with these issues in an integrated and bal-
anced manner that protects jobs and benefits for American workers and retirees. 

It  is  important  to  recognize,  however,  that  these  problems  cannot  be  solved 
through  measures  such  as  the  pending  CAFE  bills.  Light  duty  vehicles  (both  pas-
senger  cars  and  light  trucks)  account  for  approximately  16  percent  of  greenhouse 
gas  emissions  and  42  percent  of  oil  consumption  in  the  United  States.  The  CAFE 
program  only  affects  new  vehicles  sold  each  year,  which  represent  about  7  percent 
of  the  total  vehicle  stock  on  the  road.  It  takes  about  14  years  for  the  U.S.  vehicle 
fleet to completely turn over. Furthermore, because of the long lead time needed to 
retool  vehicles,  any  changes  in  the  CAFE  program  will  necessarily  have  a  delayed 
impact. 

Thus,  it  is  apparent  that  the  proposals  in  the  pending  legislation  to  increase  the 
stringency of the CAFE program would only have a very modest impact in the short 
term in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and oil consumption. 

In addition to these shortcomings, there are a number of other reasons why focus-
ing  on  the  CAFE  program  does  not  represent  the  best  approach  for  addressing  the 
problems  of  climate  change  and  energy  security.  The  CAFE  program  does  nothing 
about the fuels that go into vehicles. It is not integrated with any broader economy- 
wide  cap-and-trade  program  to  limit  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Historically,  the 
CAFE  program  has  been  subject  to  gaming  by  the  auto  companies.  And  it  does  not 
generate any revenue that could be used to assist struggling auto manufacturers in 
doing the retooling needed to meet stiffer vehicle efficiency requirements. 

To address the problem of global warming in a meaningful way, the UAW believes 
we  need  a  broad,  comprehensive  policy.  In  our  judgment,  this  policy  should  require 
all  sectors  of  the  economy  to  come  to  the  table  and  help  to  reduce  our  Nation’s 
greenhouse gas emissions. This includes all mobile sources, not just light duty vehi-
cles.  It  also  includes  stationary  sources,  such  as  power  plants  and  factories.  And, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:03 Mar 21, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80033.TXT JACKIE

27 

of  course,  it  includes  our  fossil  fuels  such  as  coal,  oil  and  natural  gas.  Each  sector 
should  be  required  to  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gases  in  a  propor-
tionate manner. No sector should enjoy a free ride. No sector should be required to 
bear  a  disproportionate  burden,  or  to  shoulder  costs  that  would  have  a  devastating 
impact on its operations or employment. 

Specifically,  the  UAW  strongly  supports  the  establishment  of  an  economy-wide 
mandatory  tradable-permits  program  that  will  slow  the  growth  of,  and  then  reduce 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  United  States.  We  believe  this  type  of  ‘‘cap- 
andtrade’’ program should be done on an ‘‘upstream’’ basis in order to minimize reg-
ulation  and  to  ensure  that  all  sectors  of  the  economy  participate  in  a  proportionate 
manner.  We  also  believe  this  program  should  include  a  ‘‘safety  valve’’  cost  cap  to 
ensure  that  no  sector  is  hit  with  unacceptable  burdens  that  would  have  a  negative 
impact on economic growth and jobs. In addition, this program should include meas-
ures to ensure that our businesses and workers are not placed at an unfair competi-
tive disadvantage with U.S. trading partners and developing countries. 

The  UAW  believes  that  this  type  of  ‘‘cap-and-trade’’  program  can  make  a  major 
contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It would ensure that such reduc-
tions  are  accomplished  in  an  economically  efficient  manner.  Because  of  the  ripple 
effect  of  higher  oil  prices  throughout  the  economy,  it  would  also  help  to  reduce  oil 
consumption. 

To  adequately  address  the  problems  of  global  warming  and  energy  security,  the 
UAW  recognizes  the  need  for  additional  measures  to  deal  with  the  automotive  sec-
tor. To be effective, we believe it is critically important that these measures address 
the  fuels  that  go  into  vehicles,  as  well  as  the  efficiency  of  the  vehicles  themselves. 
Furthermore, any auto sector policies should recognize that it is much more expen-
sive to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from light duty vehicles than 
from  other  sectors.  In  our  judgment,  the  best  way  to  address  this  disparity  would 
be  to  integrate  any  auto  sector  policies  with  economy-wide  efforts  to  reduce  green-
house gas emissions. At a minimum, the Federal Government should provide assist-
ance to the auto industry to offset this much higher compliance cost. 
(A) Auto Carbon Limits 

Instead  of  becoming  mired  in  the  old  dead-end  debate  over  the  CAFE  program, 
the UAW urges Congress to explore the feasibility of establishing an additional car-
bon  control  policy  that  would  require  reductions  in  the  carbon  emissions  of  light 
duty vehicles sold in the United States, as well as reductions in the carbon intensity 
of  the  fuels  that  go  into  these  vehicles.  This  two-pronged  approach  could  make  a 
direct,  major  contribution  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  At  the  same  time, 
it also could contribute enormously to a reduction in oil consumption. 

Under  this  approach,  auto  manufacturers  would  have  a  strong  incentive  to  im-
prove  the  efficiency  of  their  vehicles.  But  there  also  would  be  a  strong  incentive  to 
increase  the  availability  and  use  of  alternative  fuels.  This  approach  could  be  inte-
grated with an economy-wide cap-and-trade program, thereby increasing the overall 
efficiency  of  efforts  to  reduce  greenhouse  gases  and  oil  consumption.  It  could  also 
avoid  the  gaming  and  other  complications  that  have  arisen  in  connection  with  the 
CAFE  program.  Significantly,  through  the  allocation  of  allowances,  this  approach 
could help to generate the revenues needed to provide assistance to struggling auto 
manufacturers and to level the playing field in the auto industry. 

Obviously,  there  are  many  details  that  would  have  to  be  worked  out  in  order  to 
establish  this  type  of  carbon  system  for  the  auto  sector.  The  UAW  is  prepared  to 
work with this Committee and the entire Senate to fashion this type of system. 
(B) Alternative Fuels 

There  are  a  range  of  other  initiatives  that  Congress  could  pursue  to  promote  the 
use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles. These initiatives could make an enormous 
contribution  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  our  reliance  on  foreign  oil. 
Obviously,  there  is  a  need  to  promote  the  production  of  vehicles  that  are  capable 
of  running  on  alternative  fuels.  The  technology  required  to  make  vehicles  flex  fuel 
capable  is  relatively  inexpensive—about  $150  per  vehicle.  GM,  Ford  and  DCX  have 
already voluntarily committed to making 50 percent of their fleets flex fuel capable 
by 2012. The UAW would support legislation mandating that certain percentages of 
all  vehicles  sold  in  the  U.S.  by  each  automaker  must  be  flex-fuel  capable  by  speci-
fied dates. Meanwhile, to avoid any counterproductive disincentive, the CAFE credit 
for flex fuel vehicles should be extended and expanded to cover bio-diesel. 

To increase the use of alternative fuels, there also is a need to overcome technical 
hurdles facing cellulosic ethanol and bottlenecks in distribution networks. Thus, the 
UAW supports the continuation of existing incentives for the production of bio-fuels. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:03 Mar 21, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80033.TXT JACKIE

We  also  support  additional  incentives  or  mandates  relating  to  the  conversion  of  ex-
isting filling stations so they have the capability to distribute alternative fuels. 

28 

The UAW welcomes the Bush administration’s proposal to increase the renewable 
fuels  mandate.  We  also  believe  the  fuels  carbon  cap  recently  proposed  by  Governor 
Schwarzenegger  represents  a  thoughtful  approach  that  is  worth  examining  on  a 
Federal level. 
(C)  Assistance  to  Encourage  Domestic  Production  of  Advanced  Technology  Vehicles 
The  Federal  Government  currently  provides  tax  credits  to  consumers  who  pur-
chase  certain  advanced  technology  (hybrid,  diesel,  fuel  cell)  vehicles.  These  incen-
tives  are  designed  to  encourage  consumers  to  purchase  more  fuel-efficient  vehicles. 
However,  the  tax  credits  are  available  regardless  of  where  the  vehicles  and  their 
key  components  are  built.  They  are  not  tied  to  domestic  production.  Unfortunately, 
many  advanced  technology  vehicles  currently  are  assembled  in  other  nations.  Even 
worse,  virtually  all  of  the  key  components  (hybrid  electric  motors;  diesel  engines) 
for  these  vehicles  are  built  overseas,  including  the  key  components  for  vehicles  as-
sembled in this country, as well as those assembled in other countries. As these ad-
vanced  technology  vehicles  gain  a  larger  share  of  the  market,  this  means  we  are 
replacing  vehicles  that  have  higher  levels  of  domestic  content  with  vehicles  that 
have  much  lower  domestic  content.  As  a  result,  the  consumer  tax  credits  are  effec-
tively subsidizing the movement of automotive jobs overseas. For this reason, we be-
lieve it would be a major mistake for the Federal Government to rely solely on these 
consumer  tax  credits  to  encourage  the  expansion  of  advanced  technology  vehicles. 
Certainly,  these  tax  credits  should  not  be  expanded  by  increasing  the  amounts  or 
lifting the cap on the number of qualifying vehicles. 

Instead  of  this  flawed  approach,  the  UAW  urges  Congress  to  provide  incentives 
to  encourage  domestic  production  of  advanced  technology  vehicles  and  their  key 
components. As was demonstrated by a November 2004 study conducted by the Of-
fice  for  the  Study  of  Automotive  Transportation  (OSAT)  of  the  University  of  Michi-
gan  Transportation  Research  Institute,  and  commissioned  by  the  bipartisan  Na-
tional  Commission  on  Energy  Policy,  this  type  of  approach  would  help  to  maintain 
and  create  tens  of  thousands  of  automotive  jobs  in  this  country.  At  the  same  time, 
it  would  help  to  accelerate  the  introduction  of  these  advanced  technology  vehicles, 
and  thereby  reduce  global  warming  emissions  and  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil. 
Moreover, in light of the highly competitive nature of the U.S. auto market, any sav-
ings  realized  by  the  auto  manufacturers  and  parts  companies  would  inevitably  be 
translated  into  cost  reductions  for  consumers,  and  thereby  encourage  sales  of  these 
more  efficient  vehicles.  Significantly,  the  OSAT  study  indicated  that  the  increased 
tax  revenues  for  Federal,  state  and  local  governments  generated  from  the  jobs  cre-
ated for American workers would more than pay for the costs of such manufacturer 
incentives. 

The  UAW  is  pleased  that  proposals  for  a  manufacturer’s  tax  credit  to  encourage 
domestic production of advanced technology vehicles and their key components were 
included in a number of bipartisan bills in the last Congress, and that a similar pro-
posal is included in one of the pending CAFE bills, S. 767. However, because of the 
current financial situations of GM, Ford and DCX, such tax credits would be of lim-
ited value to them. Thus, the UAW urges this Committee look at other mechanisms 
for  providing  assistance  to  auto  manufacturers  to  encourage  domestic  production  of 
advanced  technology  vehicles  and  their  key  components.  This  could  include  pro-
posals  for  Federal  loan  guarantees  and/or  tax  exempt  status  for  any  bonds  issued 
to  cover  such  investments.  It  also  could  include  allowing  auto  manufacturers  to 
monetize  banked  R&D  and/or  AMT  credits  that  they  have  accumulated,  provided 
the funds are used for such investments. 
(D) Leveling the Playing Field in the Auto Industry 

As  previously  indicated,  to  make  it  economically  feasible  for  GM,  Ford  and  DCX 
to  shoulder  the  retooling  costs  associated  with  any  improvements  in  vehicle  effi-
ciency,  Congress  needs  to  help  level  the  playing  field  in  the  auto  industry  relating 
to  retiree  health  care  legacy  costs.  There  are  a  number  of  ways  Congress  could  do 
this.  This  includes  allowing  auto  manufacturers  to  use  federally  guaranteed  and/or 
tax exempt bonds to help fund retiree health care benefits, or to buy their early re-
tirees  into  the  Medicare  program  or  a  catastrophic  reinsurance  program.  It  also  in-
cludes  expanding  the  existing  65  percent  refundable,  advanceable  health  care  tax 
credit  so  it  applies  to  early  retirees  of  older  manufacturing  companies  that  have 
large  numbers  of  retirees.  The  UAW  is  prepared  to  work  with  this  Committee  and 
the  entire  Senate  to  craft  these  or  other  proposals  so  they  will  help  the  struggling 
auto  manufacturers  and  level  the  playing  field  in  the  auto  industry.  We  believe  it

29 

is essential that such proposals accompany any legislation that would impose stiffer 
vehicle efficiency requirements on the auto manufacturers. 
Conclusion 

In  conclusion,  the  UAW  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  this  Com-
mittee  concerning  the  pending  CAFE  legislation.  We  look  forward  to  working  with 
this  Committee  and  the  entire  Senate  to  fashion  new  policies  that  will  enable  the 
U.S. to make significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and oil con-
sumption, while protecting jobs and benefits for American workers and retirees. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. Reuther. 
And may I now recognize Mr. Friedman. 

STATEMENT  OF  DAVID  J.  FRIEDMAN,  RESEARCH  DIRECTOR 
AND  SENIOR  ENGINEER,  CLEAN  VEHICLES  PROGRAM, 
UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS 
Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  members  of  the  Committee,  I 
really  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  you  today;  in 
part,  because  our  country  is  faced  today  with  a  critical  question, 
and  it’s  the  same  question  and  the  same  decision  that  this  Com-
mittee faces, are we going to act to decrease our oil addiction? Are 
we going to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from our cars and 
trucks,  which  are  currently  responsible  for  more  global  warming 
pollution  than  the  entire  economy  of  India?  It  may  have  looked 
small on that chart that Senator Levin showed, but that’s only be-
cause  our  country  produces  so  much.  We  also  have  to  ask,  are  we 
going  to  give  consumers  a  solution  to  $3  a  gallon  gasoline  prices? 
Unless  you  pass  a  strong  35  mile  per  gallon  or  4  percent  per  year 
fuel  economy  bill  out  of  this  Committee,  you  will  be  answering  no 
to these questions. But Americans need you to answer yes. 

You  can  say  yes  with  confidence,  because  the  facts  have  moved 
beyond the old debates. First, there is absolutely nothing arbitrary 
about relying on research from our Nation’s top scientists and engi-
neers in setting fuel economy standards. By relying on the congres-
sionally requested research from the National Academy of Sciences, 
Congress  can  set  fuel  economy  standards  of  at  least  35  miles  per 
gallon  over  the  next  10  years,  or  about  a  4  percent  per  year  in-
crease. 

Nobody is claiming that fuel economy standards are a silver bul-
let.  We  will  also  have  to  tap  into  low-carbon  renewable  fuels  and, 
in  the  long  run,  fuel  cells  and  plug-in  hybrid  electric  vehicles.  We 
will also have to ask consumers to take responsibility for the num-
ber of miles they drive. But a good dose of common sense, loophole- 
free  fuel  economy  policy  and  good  engineering  can  deliver  the  cars 
and trucks this country needs to tackle our oil addiction. 

Second—and  we  heard  some  of  this,  I  think,  in  the  earlier 
panel—a size-based system completely changes the way you should 
look  at  fuel  economy  standards.  Hopefully,  you  have  before  you  a 
chart,  where  I  tried  to  show  an  example  of  how  size-based  stand-
ards  fulfilling  the  35  mile  per  gallon  requirement  would  treat  dif-
ferent vehicle classes. 

If  you  look  at  the  chart,  you  will  see  that  large  pickups  would 
only have to reach about 28 miles per gallon, significantly less than 
the 35 mile per gallon fleet average. Instead of large pickup trucks 
having  to  meet  that  average,  all  vehicles  will  have  to  improve  fuel 
economy under a size-based system.

Automakers  have  already  developed  the  technology  for  large 
pickups  to  reach  28  miles  per  gallon.  The  National  Academy  of 
Sciences  says  so.  Our  analysis  says  so.  These  pickups  would  have 
the same performance, size, and safety they have today. The added 
fuel  economy  technology  would  pay  for  itself  in  less  than  2  years 
at today’s gas prices, and pickup truck owners would save an addi-
tional  $4,500  on  gasoline  over  the  life  of  the  vehicle.  Higher  fuel 
economy standards will help farmers and small businesses. 

Now,  for  the  same  reason  pickups  are  protected,  size-based 
standards  effectively  eliminate  any  arguments  about  competitive-
ness between automakers based on the standards. Individual man-
ufacturers who have to sell more small vehicles to offset—sorry. In-
dividual manufacturers will not have to sell more small vehicles to 
offset sales of large vehicles. A company that focuses more on cars, 
like  Volkswagen,  would  only  have  to—would  have  to  reach  about 
39  miles  per  gallon,  while  General  Motors,  which  sells  vehicles  in 
all  size  classes,  would  only  have  to  reach  34,  5  miles  per  gallon 
lower, even though the Nation’s fleet would average 35. 

Now,  this  also  means  that  the  light-truck  loophole  can  be  elimi-
nated,  because  the  new  size-based  system  provides  automakers 
with added flexibility. 

The third important fact that has changed is that increasing fuel 
economy  will  boost  profits  and  create  more  jobs  in  the  United 
States.  We’ve  heard  30  years  of  concern,  and  understandable  con-
cern,  about  how  fuel  economy  standards  will  impact  our  manufac-
turers.  But  a  recent  2006  study  from  the  University  of  Michigan 
shows that Detroit’s Big Three could increase profits by $1.3 billion 
in  2010  if  they  invest  in  fuel  economy,  even  if  gasoline  only  costs 
$2  per  gallon.  Our  own  work  shows  that  auto-sector  jobs  could 
grow  due  to  higher  fuel  economy  standards,  compared  to  the 
shrinking world autoworkers are facing today. 

Finally, fuel economy standards are the only policy under consid-
eration  today  that  will  cut  consumer  spending  at  the  pump.  A  35 
mile  per  gallon  fuel  economy  standard  is  equivalent  to  cutting  to-
day’s $3 per gallon gasoline price by 65 cents, even after paying for 
the technology to reach that goal. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Americans  have  moved  beyond  the  old  debate, 
and it’s time for Congress to do the same. A recent New York Times 
poll  showed  that  over  90  percent  of  Americans  support  increasing 
fuel  efficiency.  A  Detroit  Free  Press  poll  showed  that  a  majority  of 
Michiganders favored higher fuel economy standards. And a yet-to- 
be-released  poll  by  the  Mellman  Group  shows  that  84  percent  of 
American pickup truck owners support a mandatory increase in the 
fuel  efficiency  of  cars,  SUVs,  and  trucks,  even  when  it  is  made 
clear  to  them  that  they  would  have  to  pay  more  up  front  in  order 
to save money on gasoline in the long run. Americans are ready to 
do their part. They want to buy more patriotic cars and trucks that 
cut oil dependence, reduce global warming pollution, and save them 
money.  What  America  needs  is  leadership  from  you.  Saying  yes  to 
guaranteed  35  miles  per  gallon  over  10  years,  or  a  guaranteed  4 
percent  per  year  increase  in  fuel  economy  standards,  will  deliver 
what Americans are asking for. 

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID J. FRIEDMAN, RESEARCH DIRECTOR AND SENIOR 

ENGINEER, UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS 

31 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to 

testify before you today. 

I appreciate the opportunity because our country is faced with a critical decision, 
the same decision faced by this committee. Are we going to continue to increase our 
addiction to oil? 

There are many important ways to ask the same question: 
• Are  we  going  to  continue  to  weigh  down  our  economy  by  paying  to  import  60 

percent of our oil at more than $60 per barrel? 

• Are  we  going  to  continue  to  produce  more  global  warming  pollution  from  our 

cars and trucks than the entire economy of India? 

• And are we going to continue to leave consumers with no solutions to $3.00 per 

gallon gasoline prices? 

We have been asking these questions for 30 years, and, for a long time, it seemed 
like  we  were  having  the  same  debate  over  and  over  again,  but  the  facts  have  now 
moved beyond the old debate. 

Fact:  There  is  nothing  arbitrary  about  relying  on  research  from  our  Nation’s  top 
scientists  and  engineers  in  setting  fuel  economy  standards.  By  relying  on  Congres-
sionally  requested  research  from  the  National  Academies  of  Science  and  research 
from  MIT,  Porsche  Engineering,  the  American  Council  for  and  Energy  Efficient 
Economy,  and  the  Union  of  Concerned  Scientists,  Congress  can  set  science-based 
fuel economy standards of at least 35 mpg for the fleet of new cars and trucks over 
the next 10 years, or about a 4 percent per year increase in fuel economy. Analysis 
of  the  NAS  data  shows  that  a  37  mpg  fleet  is  possible  using  existing  technology. 
Our own analysis shows that we could top 40 mpg. 

There  is  no  reason  to  leave  the  standard  setting  task  to  the  National  Highway 
and  Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA)  which  has  a  very  poor  record  when  it 
comes to increasing standards. 

The Ten-in-Ten bill would: 
• Cut our oil dependence by 2.1 million barrels per day in 2025—almost as much 

as we currently import from the Middle East. 

• Save consumers over $40 billion in 2025, even if gasoline is only $2.00 per gal-

lon. 

• Reduce  global  warming  pollution  by  more  than  350  million  metric  tons  of  car-
bon  dioxide  equivalent—an  18  percent  reduction  that  is  equivalent  to  taking 
about 50 million of today’s typical cars and trucks off the road. 

Fact: Pickups are protected under the reformed fuel economy standards and farm-
ers and small businesses will get the performance they need while saving thousands 
of dollars. The administration is asking for the ability to use vehicle size when set-
ting  fuel  economy  targets—a  size-based  system  completely  changes  the  way  you 
should look at CAFE. Automakers would not have to sell more small vehicles to off-
set sales of large vehicles. All vehicles will have to use better technology to improve 
fuel economy, not just big vehicles. 

The chart below is an example of how a sized-based standard fulfilling the 35 mpg 

fleetwide requirement would treat different vehicle classes.

With existing technology, the NAS showed that full-size pickups could reach 29.5 
mpg.  Our  analysis  shows  that  a  pickup  achieving  28  mpg  would  save  its  owners 
over  $6,000  on  gasoline  during  the  life  of  the  vehicle.  The  pickup  would  have  the 
same power, performance, size and safety it has today, and would cost an additional 
$1,500.  However,  the  added  fuel  economy  technology  would  pay  for  itself  in  less 
than  2  years  with  gasoline  at  $2.50  per  gallon.  Higher  fuel  economy  standards  will 
help  farmers  and  small  businesses  who  rely  on  trucks  as  much  or  even  more  than 
the average consumer. 

Fact:  Automakers  that  concentrate  on  the  pickup  market  won’t  have  to  compete 
on fuel economy with automakers that focus more on cars—the old competitiveness 
arguments are effectively eliminated. The 35 mpg goal applies only to the aggregate 
fleet of new cars and trucks sold by all automakers. NHTSA will be able to set sepa-
rate  fuel  economy  targets  for  different  classes,  so  a  company  that  focuses  more  on 
cars, like Volkswagen, would have to reach 39 mpg, while GM, which is spread out 
more across different size classes, would only have to reach 34 mpg. The new system 
requires all automakers to invest in fuel economy, addressing automaker complaints 
that they are currently being treated unfairly if they sell more large vehicles. 

This  also  means  that  the  light  truck  loophole,  and  its  problematic  impacts,  can 
be  eliminated  because  the  new  size-based  system  provides  automakers  with  added 
flexibility around larger vehicles. 

Combining  a  fleetwide  fuel  economy  standard  of  35  mpg  with  the  President’s  re-
quest  to  use  size-based  standards  means  that  large  pickups  would  only  have  to 
reach  about  28  mpg—they  will  not  have  to  hit  the  fleetwide  35  mpg  average.  In-
stead, all vehicles will have to improve fuel economy, including compact cars which 
would have to reach about 40 mpg. 

Fact: Increasing fuel economy will boost Big 3 profits and create more jobs in the 
U.S.  A  2006  study  from  the  University  of  Michigan  shows  that  Detroit’s  Big  Three 
could  increase  profits  by  $1.3  billion  in  2010  if  they  invest  in  fuel  economy,  even 
if  gasoline  costs  only  $2  per  gallon.  However,  if  they  follow  a  business-as-usual  ap-
proach  their  lost  profits  could  be  as  large  as  $3.6  billion  if  gasoline  costs  $3.10  a 
gallon. 

There  is  a  real  opportunity  here.  If  existing  technologies  are  used  to  reach  a  40 
mpg fleet in 10 years, we found that these investments would lead to 161,000 more 
jobs throughout the country. In the automotive sector, projected jobs would grow by 
40,800. These new jobs would be created because of investments in new technologies 
by the automakers and because consumers would shift spending away from gasoline 
to more productive parts of the economy. 

Fact:  Adding  a  fleetwide  goal  to  size-based  standards  addresses  the  key  Achilles 
heel of that system. Size-based standards alone can create an incentive to make ve-
hicles bigger to avoid meeting tougher standards, even if consumers are not pushing

for bigger vehicles. This would allow automakers to push down America’s fuel econ-
omy  and  increase  our  oil  dependence.  A  fleetwide  goal  eliminates  that  incentive  by 
requiring all automakers to add technology if they push up the size of the fleet. On 
the  other  hand,  if  consumers  do  demand  bigger  vehicles  on  their  own,  they  can  get 
them  under  this  system.  All  vehicles,  whether  large  or  small,  will  just  have  to  add 
more of the existing technology. 

Fact:  Fuel  economy  standards  are  the  only  policy  currently  under  consideration 
that  will  cut  consumer  spending  at  the  pump.  A  35  mpg  fuel  economy  standard  is 
equivalent to cutting today’s $3 per gallon gasoline price by 65 cents, even after pay-
ing  for  the  improved  technology.  That  represents  a  22  percent  cut  in  summer  gas 
prices. 

Gasoline savings would pay for the added cost of fuel economy technology ($1,100) 
in about 2 years. After that, the average consumer would save $3,400 more on gaso-
line over the remaining life of the vehicle. Looking at it another way, assuming you 
are  the  typical  person  and  you  take  out  a  loan  on  the  car,  your  monthly  gasoline 
costs  will  go  down  more  than  your  monthly  loan  payments  will  increase  to  pay  for 
the added fuel economy technology, so you will begin saving money on the first day 
you own the car. 

Fact: Fuel economy standards work. If we still had the same fuel economy we did 
in  the  early  1970’s,  we  would  be  using  an  additional  80  billion  gallons  of  gasoline 
on  top  of  the  140  billion  gallons  we  will  use  this  year.  That  would  represent  an  in-
crease  in  oil  demand  by  5.2  million  barrels  of  oil  per  day,  or  a  25  percent  increase 
in  our  oil  addiction.  At  last  year’s  average  price  for  regular  gasoline,  about  $2.50 
per gallon, that represents $200 billion dollars saved. That number could have been 
much  better,  however,  if  fuel  economy  standards  had  not  remained  essentially  un-
changed for the past two decades. 

Fact:  These  standards  can  be  met  by  putting  existing  efficiency  technology  to 

work; we don’t even need hybrids, though they certainly can contribute. 

Fact: These standards can be met while maintaining or improving highway safety. 
Major  reports  from  researchers  at  Oakridge  National  Labs,  Lawrence  Berkeley  Na-
tional Labs, the University of Michigan, and DRI demonstrate that fuel economy is 
not  linked  with  increased  fatalities,  large  vehicles  do  not  have  lower  fatality  rates 
when compared to smaller vehicles, and increased weight is actually associated with 
increased fatalities. 

Fact: A 35 mpg fleet can keep the performance we have now. Today, you can buy 
a family car that goes from 0 to 60 mph as fast as a late 1960s Mustang or Porsche 
911.  Using  technology  to  increase  fuel  economy  will  allow  us  to  keep  that  perform-
ance  but  focus  new  technology  applications  on  the  crisis  at  hand:  oil  addiction,  cli-
mate change and high gas prices. 

Fact:  Consumers  are  trying  to  buy  cleaner  and  more  efficient  vehicles,  but  they 
don’t  have  many  choices.  The  higher  fuel  economy  version  of  America’s  top  selling 
car, the Toyota Camry outsells the lower fuel economy version by nearly four to one. 
But  even  that  vehicle  does  not  break  the  30  mpg  barrier  for  EPA  combined  fuel 
economy.  The  auto  industry’s  version  of  a  30  mpg  vehicle  is  a  compact  car,  leaving 
millions of Americans who need minivans, family cars and SUVs with no option. 

Fact: Americans have moved beyond the old debate. 
• A  recent  New  York  Times  poll  showed  that  over  90  percent  of  Americans  sup-

port requiring automakers to make more efficient cars. 

• The same holds true for people living at the center of the auto industry—a ma-
jority of Michiganders favor higher fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, 
with some supporting increases to 40 miles per gallon or more, and many would 
pay hundreds of dollars extra for more-efficient vehicles, according to the latest 
Detroit Free Press—Local 4 Michigan Poll. 

• Pickup  drivers  also  want  higher  fuel  economy.  A  yet  to  be  released  poll  by  the 
Mellman Group shows that 84 percent of American pickup truck owners support 
a  mandatory  increase  in  the  fuel  efficiency  of  cars,  SUVs,  and  trucks—even 
when  it  was  made  clear  that  they  would  have  to  pay  more  up  front  to  save 
money on gasoline. These findings held across party lines and were even strong-
er among owners who live in rural areas than those who live in cities. 

It is time for Congress to move beyond the old debate too. 
Americans  are  ready  to  do  their  part,  they  want  to  buy  more  patriotic  cars  and 
trucks that cut oil dependence, reduce global warming and save them money. What 
Americans  need  is  leadership  from  you.  Requiring  higher  fuel  economy  standards 
will ensure consumers can have the choice to buy the higher fuel economy cars and 
trucks that the National Academies say are possible—a 29.5 mpg pickup, a 34 mpg

SUV, a 37 mpg minivan, and a 41 mpg family car. These standards should be size- 
based, but should put in place steps to eliminate or counteract any loopholes. 

Nobody  is  claiming  that  fuel  economy  standards  are  a  silver  bullet.  We  will  also 
have  to  tap  into  low  carbon  renewable  fuels  and  ask  consumers  to  take  responsi-
bility  for  the  number  of  miles  they  drive.  Nobody  should  be  allowed  to  shirk  their 
patriotic  responsibility  to  cut  our  oil  addiction  and  address  the  high  costs  climate 
change  will  have  on  our  economy.  But  a  good  dose  of  common  sense  fuel  economy 
policy  and  good  engineering  can  deliver  the  cars  and  trucks  this  country  needs  to 
help tackle these critical problems. 

For  further  information,  I  have  attached  my  recent  testimony  before  this  com-
mittee  for  additional  details  on  these  important  issues.  I  have  also  attached  a  fact 
sheet  on  the  Ten-in-Ten  bill,  the  National  Academies  report,  and  the  fuel  economy 
potential both for the country and for trucks. I hope you find these helpful. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Friedman. 
Admiral Blair? 

STATEMENT  OF  ADMIRAL  DENNIS  C.  BLAIR,  USN  (RET.), 
FORMER  COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF,  U.S.  PACIFIC  COMMAND, 
USN;  MEMBER,  ENERGY  SECURITY  LEADERSHIP  COUNCIL; 
OMAR  BRADLEY  CHAIR  OF  STRATEGIC  LEADERSHIP,  ARMY 
WAR COLLEGE AND DICKINSON COLLEGE 
Admiral BLAIR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
This  afternoon,  I’m  speaking  on  behalf—turn  it  on.  All  right. 
This  afternoon,  I’m  speaking  on  behalf  of  the  Energy  Security 
Leadership  Council.  We’re  a  group  of  20  business  executives  and 
retired senior military officers. We’re led by Fred Smith, of FedEx, 
and  General  P.X.  Kelley,  retired  United  States  Marine  Corps.  And 
our driving belief is that the oil dependency that we have severely 
threatens  the  economic  and  the  national  security  interests  of  the 
United  States.  And  this  is  one  of  the  most  important  security 
issues facing this country. 

In  December,  we  unveiled  a  set  of  recommendations  to  the  Na-
tion on reducing U.S. oil dependence, and we recommended a com-
prehensive  program,  specific  measurable  steps  to  cut  in  half  the 
number  of  barrels  of  oil  that  we  consume  to  produce  a  dollar  of 
GDP  by  2030;  that  is,  to  halve  the  oil  intensity  of  this  country. 
And,  based  on  these  recommendations,  Senator  Dorgan  and  Sen-
ator  Craig  have  designed  the  Security  and  Fuel  Efficiency  Energy 
Act of 2007, that Senator Dorgan referred to, and they recently in-
troduced  the  fuel  economy  sections  of  this  bill  as  the  Fuel  Effi-
ciency Energy Act of 2007. 

And  we’ve  already  heard  the  contributions  that  many  distin-
guished Senators in this Committee have made in recognizing that 
transportation fuel efficiency is a vital national security imperative. 
The  iron  logic  is,  we  import  60  percent  of  the  20  million  barrels  of 
oil  we  use  every  day.  Seventy  percent  of  that  is  used  in  the  trans-
portation  sector.  The  transportation  sector  depends  on  oil.  A  strat-
egy for reducing oil dependency has got to tackle the transportation 
sector. That’s not all it has to tackle, but it has to tackle that. 

So, under our Council’s proposal, we propose that the fleet of new 
passenger  cars  and  light  trucks  sold  in  the  United  States  each 
year,  the  entire  fleet,  will  have  to  get  4  percent  better  mileage 
every year than the fleet sold the year before. We also would apply 
the  same  standards  to  commercial  trucks,  which  have  never  pre-
viously been subject to limitations.

This 4 percent is not a number plucked out of thin air. It’s in line 
with  the  historical  annual  gains  that  we  made  when  we  took  this 
thing  seriously  and  we  last  committed  ourselves  to  fuel  economy, 
and this has been cited several times. This is consistent with tech-
nical study results. We can do it. 

We also believe that these new standards have to have flexibility. 
We  believe  that  NHTSA  ought  to  have  the  discretion  to  establish 
attribute-based classes of vehicles so that there could be a different 
standard  for  freight-hauling  vehicles  from  that  for  passenger  vehi-
cles. 

We  also  believe  that  there  ought  to  be  off-ramps.  If  NHTSA, 
based on expert opinion and data, judges that 4 percent in a given 
year is either technologically infeasible or it endangers safety or it’s 
not cost-effective, then they should have the ability to change it. 

And so, we believe that this idea of a 4 percent standard, vehicle 
classes based on attributes, and off-ramps gives credit to American 
ingenuity,  technological  prowess,  and  it  will  protect  business  from 
value-destroying mandates. 

And  finally,  the  legislation  that  we  favor  contains  a  variety  of 
consumer  and  manufacturer  tax  credits  that  will  help  car  makers 
and  car  buyers  to  adjust  to  buying  cars  which  have  greater  fuel 
economy.  And  this  will  result  in,  we  think,  two  outcomes.  It’ll  im-
prove our energy security and will also provide for a domestic auto-
mobile industry that is competitive. 

Now, I personally honor and respect the historical contribution to 
national  defense  that  companies  like  GM  and  Ford  have  made. 
More  than  half  a  million  ‘‘deuce  and  a  half’’  trucks  carried  U.S. 
troops  and  their  gear  around  in  World  War  II.  The  Ford’s  Willow 
Run  plant,  by  itself,  produced  nearly  9,000  B–24s.  And  we  think 
the  American  auto  industry  can  contribute  to  the  national  defense 
in the future, as it has in the past. 

One question we’re often asked is, what is a bunch of retired sen-
ior  officers  doing  getting  so  worked  up  about  fuel-efficient  cars? 
And I guess the answer is that we’ve seen firsthand how increasing 
U.S. dependence on oil from underdeveloped volatile areas overseas 
creates  security  risks  for  the  country.  It  puts  strains  on  our  mili-
tary  forces  and  assigns  them  expensive  missions  for  which  they’re 
the wrong instrument of national power. 

When  I  first  joined  the  Navy,  in  1968,  the  entire  U.S.  military 
presence  in  the  Persian  Gulf  was  one  flagship  and  two  destroyers. 
Now  our  security  policy  in  the  Gulf  is  dominated  by  the  use  of 
major  military  force  units.  It’s  expensive.  The  Persian  Gulf  is  on 
the  other  side  of  the  world.  It  takes  over  three  ships  to  maintain 
one over there. It takes three soldiers, airmen, or marines. You just 
got  back,  you’re  there,  or  you’re  going.  And  it’s  difficult  to  do  it 
right.  When  we  put  major  force  units  into  underdeveloped  volatile 
countries,  it  has  major  unintended  consequences,  rarely  turns  out 
to be quick, controlled, and short-lived, and our forces there of this 
size  with  this  duration  cause  local  resentments  and  dangers  that 
really  work  against  what  we’re  trying  to  achieve  with  our  overall 
security policy. 

You  look  at  new  sources  of  oil,  like  Central  Asia,  West  Africa,

need  to  find  a  better  approach  to  oil  security,  and  we  have  to  re-
duce our dependence on overseas oil. 

So,  let  me  tie  things  back  to  the  policy  objectives  of  this  Com-
mittee. Improved security will require greater conservation, as well 
as  increased  production  of  petroleum  and  alternatives  here  at 
home.  So,  improved  fuel  economy  will  increase  not  just  our  energy 
security,  but  our  military  security,  our  overall  national  security. 
We’ll  be  less  susceptible  to  being  whipsawed  by  events  in  the  Per-
sian  Gulf,  Central  Asia,  and  West  Africa.  We’ll  not  have  to  be  on 
a hair-trigger for major military involvements in these regions with 
their  expense  and  all  the  difficulties  of  doing  the  mission  success-
fully and extracting cleanly. 

So, let me finish by encouraging you to support amendments that 
ensure an aggressive, but flexible, approach to increasing fuel econ-
omy of the entire—the entire—U.S. transportation fleet. The essen-
tial  elements  of  this  approach  are  a  4  percent  annual  increase  ap-
plied  to  all  on-road  vehicles,  including  medium  and  heavy  trucks, 
and  containing  these  off-ramps  that  will  protect  consumers  and 
manufacturers. 

And  we,  on  the  Council,  are  committed  to  working  with  you  to 
continue making this an important—getting the work done. And we 
just all feel that it’s really time to move and reverse this increasing 
energy dependency, which is endangering our national security. We 
can  do  it  in  a  bipartisan  way  that  the  entire  country  can  support. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ADMIRAL DENNIS C.  BLAIR,  USN  (RET.),  FORMER 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, U.S. PACIFIC COMMAND, USN; MEMBER, ENERGY SECURITY 
LEADERSHIP COUNCIL;  OMAR BRADLEY CHAIR OF STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP,  ARMY 
WAR COLLEGE AND DICKINSON COLLEGE 
I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  fuel-economy 
legislation from the perspective of national security. I speak to you on behalf of the 
Energy  Security  Leadership  Council  (Council),  a  non-partisan  group  that  brings  to-
gether  twenty  business  executives  and  retired  senior  military  officers  who  are  con-
cerned  about  the  perilous  state  of  U.S.  and  global  energy  security.  We  are  led  by 
Frederick  W.  Smith,  Chairman,  President  and  CEO  of  FedEx,  and  General  P.X. 
Kelley (Ret.), the 28th Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. And we are 
united  in  the  belief  that  oil  dependence  severely  threatens  the  economic  and  na-
tional security of the United States. 

On December 13, 2006, the Council unveiled a set of Recommendations to the Na-
tion on Reducing U.S. Oil Dependence. This report outlines a comprehensive energy 
security  strategy.  It  replaces  the  false  hope  of  domestic  energy  independence  with 
strategies  for  better  managing  the  reality  of  global  energy  interdependence.  The 
suggested  initiatives  are  aggressive  while  being  balanced  and  credible.  Where  the 
market cannot be expected to provide solutions, government has been asked to apply 
workable  standards  capable  of  spurring  the  needed  private-sector  responses.  The 
members  of  the  Council  have  pledged  to  continue  working  until  these  policy  rec-
ommendations are enacted into law. 

During the last few months, the Council has collaborated with Senator Byron Dor-
gan and Senator Larry Craig to design legislation that incorporates the central ele-
ments  of  the  Recommendations.  This  collaboration  has  given  rise  to  the  ‘‘Security 
and Fuel Efficiency Energy Act of 2007 (SAFE Energy Act),’’ which was formally in-
troduced on March 14. Senators Dorgan and Craig recently introduced just the fuel 
economy  sections  of  this  bill  as  the  ‘‘Fuel  Efficiency  Energy  Act  of  2007.’’  I  want  to 
commend Senators Dorgan and Craig for their leadership and commitment. 

I  also  want  to  thank  Chairman  Inouye  and  Vice  Chairman  Stevens  along  with 
Senators Feinstein, Snowe, and all others who have recognized that increased trans-
portation fuel efficiency is a vital national security imperative. Our nation consumes 
more  than  20  million  barrels  of  oil  per  day  (mbd),  more  than  60  percent  of  it  im-

ported. Nearly 70 percent of our oil consumption goes to fuel the transportation sec-
tor.  Transportation  relies  on  oil  for  97  percent  of  delivered  energy  with  almost  no 
substitutes  available.  By  any  measure  that  I  know  of,  such  extraordinary  depend-
ence is inconsistent with national security. 

The Council’s approach tackles oil dependence through many policies, but none of 
these  is  more  crucial  than  reformed  and  strengthened  vehicle  fuel  economy  stand-
ards. Standards are necessary because there is no free market for oil. Oil prices may 
be  a  function  of  supply  and  demand,  but  the  oil  market  is  well  removed  from  the 
free-market ideal. As much as 90 percent of all oil and gas reserves are held by na-
tional  oil  companies  (NOCs)  that  are  either  partially  or  fully  controlled  by  govern-
ments,  not  public  companies  operating  in  the  free  market.  Moreover,  the  market  is 
highly cartelized, with one group—OPEC—setting prices and supply based on a va-
riety  of  pressures  including  political  concerns.  The  marketplace  alone  will  also  not 
act preemptively to mitigate the enormous damage that would be inflicted by a seri-
ous  and  sudden  price  increase.  Thus,  government  must  apply  workable  standards 
capable of spurring private-sector responses. 

Under the Council’s proposal, the fleet of new passenger cars and light trucks sold 
in the United States each year will have to get 4 percent more miles per gallon than 
the fleet of cars and light trucks sold the year before. The same will be true of com-
mercial  trucks,  which  have  never  previously  been  subject  to  fuel  efficiency  stand-
ards.  The  proposal  gives  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration 
(NHTSA) the discretion to require different percentage increases for different class-
es  of  vehicles  in  pursuit  of  4  percent  annual  fuel  economy  improvement  for  the  en-
tire new vehicle fleet. 

These  measures  will  help  us  reduce  the  oil  intensity  of  this  country.  Oil  inten-
sity—the  amount  of  oil  needed  to  generate  a  dollar  of  GDP—has  been  cut  in  half 
since the oil shock of the 1970s. The result is a U.S. economy that still sees steady 
growth despite high oil prices such as those experienced over the last few years. Un-
fortunately,  progress  in  further  lowering  oil  intensity  has  slowed  noticeably  in  the 
last decade. We must do better. 

Four percent is not an arbitrarily chosen number. It is right in line with the his-
torical  annual  gains  that  were  achieved  when  the  Nation  last  committed  itself  to 
fuel  economy.  It  is  also  perfectly  consistent  with  scientifically-validated  forecasts  of 
cost-effective future fuel economy improvements. Between 1975 and 1985, the miles 
per  gallon  (mpg)  performance  of  passenger  cars  in  the  U.S.  increased  5.5  percent 
per year. The figures for light trucks rose 4.2 percent per year over the same period. 
In  its  2002  study  of  CAFE,  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)  concluded 
that  the  fuel  economy  of  large  U.S.  passenger  cars  could  be  cost-effectively  raised 
by  as  much  27  percent  within  a  decade  using  available  and  emerging  technologies. 
For the largest light trucks, the potential improvement was 42 percent. The implied 
potential fuel economy for the entire fleet given the existing mix of vehicles was 30.3 
mpg,  more  than  25  percent  above  the  current  figures.  Significantly,  these  improve-
ments  were  premised  on  the  use  of  existing  and  emerging  technologies  without  al-
tering the average weight, size-mix, or performance of the fleet. The 2002 study was 
conducted  on  the  basis  of  gasoline  prices  of  $1.50  per  gallon.  One  of  the  principal 
authors  of  the  2002  study,  Dr.  David  L.  Greene  of  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory, 
has  incorporated  today’s  higher  fuel  prices  into  the  NAS  model  while  holding  tech-
nology  assumptions  constant.  A  retail  gasoline  price  of  $2.50  per  gallon  raises  the 
expected cost-effective fuel economy of the entire fleet to 33.9 mpg. Even these pro-
jections  may  be  too  pessimistic  in  light  of  accelerating  technological  progress.  In-
deed, since diesels and hybrids did not figure in the cost curves utilized for the 2002 
study,  but  are  now  viewed  as  promising  candidates  for  large-scale  introduction  in 
the U.S. marketplace, Dr. Greene is optimistic that current fuel economy levels can 
be raised by as much as 50 percent—even after applying the same weight and per-
formance constraints used in the 2002 study. 

The  new  standards  are  designed  to  be  very  flexible.  For  instance,  pickup  trucks 
may  not  be  able  to  obtain  the  same  fuel-economy  levels  as  SUVs  or  minivans,  but 
the  ESLC  proposal  does  not  require  them  to  do  so.  To  reiterate,  NHTSA  will  have 
the  discretion  to  require  different  percentage  increases  for  different  classes  of  vehi-
cles in pursuit of 4 percent annual fuel-economy improvement for the entire new ve-
hicle  fleet.  Vehicle  classes  will  be  determined  by  key  attributes,  and  under  this  ap-
proach  it  would  be  perfectly  justifiable  to  hold  primarily  freight-hauling  vehicles  to 
a lesser fuel-economy standard than would be applied to vehicles designed first and 
foremost for transporting passengers. By assessing multiple attributes, NHTSA can 
constructively  classify  vehicles  to  maximize  fuel  economy  while  tailoring  the  stand-
ards  so  that  pickups  will  not  be  forced  to  compete  with  sedans  that  are  roughly  as 
long and as wide.

38 

Flexibility  is  further  ensured  by  ‘‘off-ramps’’  that  may  be  employed  if  NHSTA 
finds  4  percent  improvement  in  a  given  year  to  be  technically  infeasible,  unsafe,  or 
not cost-effective. These are not loopholes, since expert opinion and data will be re-
quired  to  invoke  them.  But,  together,  the  4  percent  annual  improvement  standard 
and the off-ramps give credit to American ingenuity and technological prowess while 
protecting business from unachievable or value-destroying mandates. 

Finally,  the  proposed  legislation  contains  a  variety  of  consumer  and  manufac-
turing  tax  credits  that  will  help  car  makers  and  car  buyers  adjust  to  greater  fuel 
economy. 

Overall,  this  approach  aims  for  two  highly  desirable  outcomes:  improved  energy 
security  and  a  competitive  domestic  automotive  industry.  To  improve  energy  secu-
rity,  America  needs  to  get  millions  of  fuel  efficient  cars  on  the  road.  But  we  will 
not  have  a  secure  source  of  these  vehicles  without  public  policies  that  expedite  the 
needed  transition  of  U.S.-based  manufacturing  capacity.  In  order  to  level  the  play-
ing  field  and  enable  domestic  manufacturers  to  effectively  compete  in  the  growing 
market for advanced-technology vehicles, we support tax incentives for the retooling 
of domestic automobile parts and manufacturing facilities. 

Let me say that I recognize and respect the historical contribution that car compa-
nies  like  GM  and  Ford  have  made  to  our  defense.  More  than  half  a  million  GMC 
‘‘Deuce and a half’’ trucks gave U.S forces in World War II unmatched logistical sup-
port.  Ford’s  Willow  Run  plant  by  itself  produced  nearly  9,000  B–24  bombers  that 
provided  the  U.S.  Army  Air  Corps  with  much  of  its  strategic  punch.  I  am  asking 
these  companies  to  continue  this  legacy  of  service  to  the  Nation  by  embracing  the 
mission of improved fuel economy. 

Having outlined the fuel-economy legislation we support, I’d like to devote the rest 
of my time to describing why improvement is so necessary. I will do this from a mili-
tary  vantage  point,  since  this  is  where  my  expertise  and  knowledge  are  con-
centrated.  Put  simply:  the  increasing  U.S.  dependence  on  oil  imported  from  under-
developed volatile regions of the world is putting a strain on our military forces and 
it  is  assigning  them  expensive  missions  for  which  they’re  really  the  wrong  instru-
ment of national power. 

This  problem  is  best  understood  by  looking  at  the  Persian  Gulf  which  is  home  to 
the  five  countries  with  the  greatest  proven  conventional  petroleum  reserves.  When 
I first joined the Navy in 1968, the entire U.S. military presence in that part of the 
world  was  a  one  star  Navy  admiral  and  two  destroyers  that  would  deploy  to  hold 
simple exercises with Gulf countries. As I recall gas at that time ran 30 to 40 cents 
a  gallon  for  my  Austin  Healey  3000,  and  the  Persian  Gulf  was  a  rare  duty  station 
for members of the armed forces. 

In  the  late  1970’s  two  serious  threats  to  Persian  Gulf  oil  were  identified  by  the 
Carter  Administration,  which  became  seized  by  the  issue.  The  first  was  a  potential 
Soviet  invasion  from  the  north  into  the  oil  regions  around  the  Gulf,  a  concern 
heightened  by  the  Soviet  occupation  of  Afghanistan.  The  second  was  an  aggressive 
and  fundamentalist  Iran,  which  was  led  by  a  regime  that  had  permitted  and  then 
exploited the takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran. In response, the Depart-
ment  of  Defense  created  the  Rapid  Deployment  Joint  Task  Force,  the  RDJTF,  a 
planning  headquarters  and  contingency  force  that  could  quickly  deploy  to  the  Gulf 
to  defeat  a  major  land  invasion.  In  1983  as  part  of  its  general  military  buildup 
against  the  Soviet  Union,  the  Reagan  administration  upgraded  this  task  force  to  a 
regional  command  like  the  European  Command  and  the  Pacific  Command,  where 
I  served  and  where  I  ultimately  commanded.  So  this  Central  Command  had  full 
time responsibility for U.S. interests in the region. 

Every commander of the Central Command, which was what the new organization 
was called, has had the mission of ensuring the security of oil from the Persian Gulf 
since that time. In response to the 1987 attacks on tankers by Iran and Iraq as part 
of  their  war,  the  United  States  gave  Kuwaiti  tankers  U.S.  registry  and  provided 
naval escorts for them as well as for tankers of allied nations. So, by 1990 America 
had  a  functioning  military  command  structure,  had  deployed  major  forces  to  the 
Gulf  both  for  exercises  and  for  combat  operations,  and  had  established  a  military 
commitment  to  oil  security.  The  military  component  of  American  security  policy  in 
the  Gulf  region  had  greatly  increased,  and—as  we  saw—it  crowded  out  diplomacy, 
reliance on the market, and more indirect instruments of national power. 

U.S.  security  policy  in  the  Gulf  since  then  has  been  in  the  headlines,  familiar  to 
everyone,  and  dominated  by  the  use  of  major  military  force:  operations  Desert 
Shield  and  Desert  Storm  in  1991;  during  the  course  of  the  1990’s  the  maintenance 
of  Air  Force  and  Navy  air  wings  in  the  Gulf  on  a  full  time  basis  to  enforce  no-fly 
zones in the north and the south of Iraq; an Army brigade full time in Kuwait; peri-
odic  bombings  of  Iraq  during  that  period.  And  then  following  9/11,  the  intervention 
in  Afghanistan  and  invasion  and  occupation  of  Iraq.  For  those  of  us  in  the  armed

39 

forces  the  operations  in  this  region  of  the  world  are  expensive  and  tactically  prob-
lematic. 

As a general rule, the use of large scale military force in volatile regions of under-
developed  countries  is  difficult  to  do  right,  has  major  unintended  consequences  and 
rarely  turns  out  to  be  quick,  effective,  controlled  and  short  lived.  The  Persian  Gulf 
is  just  about  on  the  other  side  of  the  world  from  the  United  States.  It  takes  more 
than  3  ships  in  the  U.S.  Navy  to  keep  one  ship  on  station:  one  there,  one  going, 
one  coming.  Pretty  much  the  same  ratio  holds  for  airplanes  and,  as  we’re  learning 
in  Iraq,  for  soldiers  and  Marines.  You  just  got  back,  you’re  there  or  you’re  getting 
ready  to  go  again.  A  major  military  presence  in  the  Gulf  region  raises  local 
resentments  and  dangers  that  work  against  what  we’re  trying  to  achieve.  This  is 
not just a post-9/11 phenomenon. It was true well before 9/11 in terms of the effect 
of  major  U.S.  military  forces  staged  or  spending  large  amounts  of  time  in  the  Gulf 
region. So after all this major military effort, what’s the bottom line? Gas is pushing 
$3  a  gallon,  we’re  extending  the  tours  of  soldiers  in  the  Gulf  region  to  15  months, 
and we’re more subject to events in the Persian Gulf than we ever were in the past. 
Now,  why  has  American  security  policy  developed  in  this  way?  The  fast  pace  of 
operations  in  the  region  has  given  little  pause  for  reflecting  on  overall  trends  and 
effectiveness. American forces have been engaged in the Middle East since the tank-
er  wars  of  1987,  and  events  have  seemed  to  demand  increasing  our  military  force, 
not reducing it. But driving this engagement is America’s ever growing dependence 
on  overseas  petroleum.  This  dependence  has  influenced  successive  administrations 
to strengthen military engagement rather than to search for other means—perhaps 
politically more difficult but in the long run more cost-effective means—for boosting 
energy security. 

This  expensive  and  somewhat  clumsy  model  is  shaping  our  energy  security  ap-
proach  in  other  regions  of  the  world  outside  the  Gulf.  Consider  Central  Asia,  home 
to  an  increasing  share  of  the  world’s  oil  and  natural  gas  reserves  in  the  future.  Al-
ready  we  see  recourse  to  some  of  the  early  chapters  to  the  same  play  book  we  fol-
lowed in the Persian Gulf, 20 and 30 years ago. 

In conclusion, let me tie things back to the policy objectives of the Committee: im-
proved  security  will  require  greater  conservation  as  well  as  increased  production  of 
petroleum  and  alternatives  here  at  home.  Put  another  way,  improved  vehicle  fuel 
economy  will  increase  our  military  flexibility  and  our  overall  national  security,  not 
just our energy security. We’ll be less susceptible to being whip-sawed by events in 
the  Persian  Gulf,  Central  Asia  and  West  Africa.  We  will  not  have  to  be  on  a  hair- 
trigger  for  major  military  involvements  in  these  regions  with  their  great  expense 
and all the difficulties of successful mission execution and withdrawal of forces. And 
we  will  be  in  position  to  break  the  cycle  of  increasing  oil  dependence  followed  by 
increased deployments of major U.S. forces into volatile and underdeveloped regions 
where they are often poorly matched to the mission of oil security. 

So let me conclude by encouraging you to support amendments that ensure an ag-
gressive  but  flexible  approach  for  increasing  the  fuel  economy  of  the  entire  U.S. 
transportation fleet. In keeping with the Council’s fuel-economy proposal as it is em-
bodied  in  the  SAFE  Energy  Act  and  the  Fuel  Efficiency  Energy  Act  of  2007,  future 
fuel-economy provisions should: 

1. require 4 percent annual increases in vehicle fuel economy, 
2.  be  applied  to  all  on-road  vehicles,  including  medium  and  heavy  trucks,  and 
3.  contain  ‘‘off-ramps’’  that  will  protect  consumers  and  manufacturers  by  relax-
ing the 4 percent annual increases if they prove to be too costly, unsafe, or tech-
nically  infeasible.  These  are  not  loopholes,  since  expert  opinion  and  data  will 
be required to invoke them. 

The  Council  is  committed  to  working  with  you  in  true  bipartisan  fashion  to 

achieve these goals. Our nation deserves no less. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Admiral Blair.

MANUFACTURERS, INC. 

Mr. STANTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
AIAM  and  its  members  have  historically  taken  progressive  posi-
tions  on  fuel  economy,  energy  security,  and  global  climate  change.

We have consistently supported the need to addresses these issues 
and the auto industry to play a role in this process. 

In  a  2001  statement  before  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences, 
AIAM  recognized  the  seriousness  of  these  issues  and  urged  that 
consideration  be  given  to  the  adoption  of  an  attribute-based  CAFE 
program.  AIAM  supports  NHTSA’s  restructuring  of  the  light  truck 
CAFE  program  based  on  vehicle  footprint.  Although  this  program 
is  new,  we  are  optimistic  that  NHTSA  has  promulgated  a  good 
final  rule.  Consequently,  we  favor  legislation  to  authorize  similar 
restructuring  of  the  passenger-car  standards,  leading  to  the  adop-
tion of some form of an attribute-based system. 

Such a system is desirable, since it enables NHTSA to set stand-
ards at levels that are feasible for manufacturers, offering different 
mixes  of  vehicles  and  more  flexibility  in  responding  to  changing 
market conditions. In addition, this approach helps ensure that fu-
ture  gains  in  fleet  fuel  economy  will  be  the  result  of  technology, 
and not shifts in fleet mix. 

Lead time for any new standards is also critical. Current law re-
quires NHTSA to set standards with a minimum of 18 months lead 
time.  However,  18  months  is  sufficient  only  for  standards  that  im-
pose  little  increase  in  stringency.  For  more  aggressive  standards, 
substantial lead time is necessary to allow for the development and 
implementation  of  new  technology.  AIAM  recommends  that 
NHTSA  set  standards  in  3-year  increments  and  provide  a  min-
imum of 3-year lead time. 

AIAM  unequivocally  opposes  the  adoption  of  a  uniform  percent-
age  improvement  requirement  or  any  other  similarly  discrimina-
tory  program  such  as  a  specific  manufacturer  total  carbon  tailpipe 
cap-and-trade system. 

AIAM  supports  the  elimination  of  the  domestic  import  fleet  re-
quirements for passenger cars. This requirement was originally in-
tended  to  inhibit  domestic  manufacturers  from  importing  large 
numbers of small captive-import vehicles as a compliance strategy. 
In  practice,  this  provision  has  created  a  disincentive  for  foreign- 
based  companies  to  increase  the  U.S.  content  of  their  vehicles  to 
levels above 75 percent. This disincentive is real, and has cost U.S. 
jobs. 

We  also  support  enhanced  trading  of  CAFE  credits  between  a 
manufacturer’s fleets. The law should allow credits to be traded be-
tween  import  and  domestic  passenger  car  fleets,  if  the  distinction 
is  not  eliminated,  and  between  passenger  cars  and  light  trucks. 
This  approach  would  maintain  the  fleet  average  concept  central  to 
the determination of compliance under the existing law. 

And  we  also  believe  the  carry-forward  and  carry-back  provisions 
in  current  law  should  be  extended  from  3  years  to  5  years.  This 
will  have  no  adverse  effect  on  fuel  savings,  but  will  provide  addi-
tional  compliance  flexibility.  Enhanced  credit  trading  has,  in  fact, 
been  recommended  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  as  a 
means of increasing manufacturers’ compliance flexibility while re-
ducing costs. 

AIAM  is  concerned  that  State-level  fuel  economy  standards,  or 
standards  that  are  functionally  equivalent  to  fuel  economy  stand-
ards,  would  impose  severe  manufacturing  and  marketing  burdens. 
As  a  result  of  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in  Massachusetts

versus  EPA,  NHTSA  has  authority  to  set  fuel  economy  standards, 
and EPA has authority to set emission standards. However, we be-
lieve  that  the  methods  of  complying  with  CAFE  standards,  on  the 
one  hand,  and  with  carbon  dioxide  standards,  on  the  other  hand, 
are  virtually  indistinguishable.  AIAM  favors  a  national  program 
that avoids separate requirements. 

Finally,  the  effectiveness  of  CAFE  would  be  significantly  en-
hanced  if  coupled  with  appropriate  market-based  incentives  for 
consumers. Tax credits for advanced technology vehicles are an ex-
ample of an incentive that is potentially very effective. Such credits 
are  helpful  in  overcoming  the  high  initial  cost  of  new  technology. 
And thank you for the opportunity to testify today. AIAM and its 
members  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Committee  as  it  moves 
forward on this important subject.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL J. STANTON, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 
ASSOCIATION OF INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS, INC. 

Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee.  I  am  Michael  J. 
Stanton,  President  and  CEO  of  the  Association  of  International  Automobile  Manu-
facturers, Inc. (‘‘AIAM’’). I appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you today the 
very important matter of legislation regarding the Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
(CAFE) standards program. 

AIAM is a trade association representing 14 international motor vehicle manufac-
turers  who  account  for  40  percent  of  all  passenger  cars  and  light  trucks  sold  annu-
ally in the United States. AIAM members have invested over $35.5 billion in 47 U.S. 
vehicle  plants,  component  manufacturing  facilities  and  R&D  centers  which  employ 
92,500  Americans  with  a  payroll  of  nearly  $7  billion.  AIAM  member  company  U.S. 
facilities  produced  3.37  million  units  in  2005—more  than  31  percent  of  total  U.S. 
production.  More  than  half  (54  percent)  of  all  vehicles  sold  by  AIAM  members  in 
the United States are made in the United States. 

AIAM  members  plan  to  invest  another  $3  billion  in  the  United  States  to  create 
7,000 new American jobs by 2009 by constructing three new vehicle assembly plants 
and  an  engine  plant  and  expanding  existing  facilities.  AIAM  companies  purchased 
nearly $52 billion in parts and materials from U.S. suppliers in 2005 and that num-
ber is growing. 

AIAM  member  companies  have  for  many  years  been  leaders  in  offering  fuel-effi-
cient  vehicles  for  the  U.S.  market.  Historically,  vehicles  produced  by  our  member 
companies have topped the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) annual list of 
most  fuel-efficient  vehicles.  Nine  of  the  top  ten  models  on  the  EPA’s  Fuel  Economy 
Leaders list for 2007 are manufactured by AIAM members. Member companies have 
achieved  this  fuel  economy  leadership  to  a  significant  degree  by  pioneering  the  in-
troduction  of  advanced  automotive  technology  into  their  vehicles.  In  recent  years, 
this leadership has been demonstrated with the introduction and popular acceptance 
of  hybrid  vehicles  and  continuously  variable  transmissions  and  successful  develop-
ment  work  on  other  advanced  technology  vehicles  including  fuel  cells.  Starting  in 
1999, AIAM members were the first to offer American consumers hybrid electric ve-
hicles and have now sold more than a half-million hybrids in the United States. For 
the  2007  model  year,  AIAM  members  offer  eight  hybrid  models—six  cars  and  two 
SUVs.  Our  member  companies  continue  to  introduce  a  variety  of  advanced  tech-
nology models. 

AIAM  and  its  members  have  historically  taken  progressive  positions  with  regard 
to the related issues of fuel economy, energy security and global climate change. We 
have consistently supported the national need to address these matters and for the 
auto industry to play a constructive role in that process. In a 2001 statement before 
the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS),  AIAM  recognized  that  the  seriousness  of 
energy  security  and  global  climate  change  justify  a  regulatory  role  for  the  Federal 
Government in enhancing vehicle fuel efficiency. At that time we urged that consid-
eration be given to the adoption of an attributebased CAFE standards system, such 
as  one  based  on  vehicle  market  class,  size,  or  weight.  AIAM  supports  increasing 
CAFE  standards  through  rulemaking  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation 
(DOT)  as  a  reasonable  approach  to  enhancing  national  security  and  energy  con-
servation  and  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  motor  vehicles.  Our  support

for  such  standards  is  conditioned  upon  the  standards  being  technologically  achiev-
able,  providing  manufacturers  adequate  leadtime  for  compliance,  and  being  estab-
lished  in  a  form  that  does  not  discriminate  against  any  segment  of  the  auto  indus-
try.  We  prefer  the  approach  of  allowing  DOT  to  set  the  standards,  since  it  assures 
that the standards are analytically based, reflects well-understood technology devel-
opments  and  statutory  considerations,  and  provides  an  open  process  for  the  consid-
eration of public comments on proposed standards. It is impossible to predict future 
fuel prices or the rate of technology development. This makes it impossible to accu-
rately  predict  the  optimum  level  for  CAFE  standards.  Thus,  it  is  essential  that  an 
expert  agency,  such  as  DOT,  evaluate  the  pace  of  technology  development  and  fuel 
prices and adjust the standards, up or down, as needed. 

The  issue  of  adequate  leadtime  for  new  standards  is  critical.  The  current  law  al-
lows  DOT  to  set  standards  with  a  minimum  of  18  months  leadtime.  However,  the 
18 month period is sufficient only for standards that impose little or no increase in 
stringency.  For  more  aggressive  standards,  substantial  leadtime  is  necessary  to 
allow  for  development  and  implementation  of  new  technology,  with  the  most  effi-
cient  technologies  generally  requiring  the  longest  leadtime.  Moreover,  given  the 
need  for  substantial  in-use  vehicle  fleet  turnover  before  new  technology  achieves 
widespread  market  penetration,  the  benefits  of  implementation  of  new  technology 
take significantly longer to substantially affect total in-use fuel consumption. In any 
event, major improvements in new vehicle fuel economy cannot be achieved with the 
current  statutory  leadtime.  AIAM  recommends  that  the  National  Highway  Traffic 
Safety  Administration  (NHTSA)  set  standards  in  3  year  increments  and  provide  a 
minimum of 3 years leadtime. 

We  generally  support  NHTSA’s  recent  restructuring  of  the  light  truck  CAFE 
standards based on size class principles. Although this program is new and we have 
no practical experience with it yet, we think NHTSA promulgated a good final rule 
based  on  an  extensive  analysis  of  complex  data.  Consequently,  we  favor  legislation 
to  authorize  a  similar  restructuring  of  the  passenger  auto  standards  leading  to  the 
adoption  of  some  form  of  attribute-based  system.  Such  a  system  is  desirable  since 
it  enables  DOT  to  set  standards  at  levels  that  are  feasible  for  manufacturers  that 
offer  different  mixes  of  vehicles,  and  it  is  more  flexible  in  responding  to  changed 
market conditions. In addition, future gains in fleet fuel economy will be the result 
of technology and not shifting fleet mix. 

AIAM  unequivocally  opposes  the  adoption  of  a  uniform  percentage  improvement 
(UPI) standards format, or any other similarly discriminatory program. Simply stat-
ed,  such  standards  represent  bad  public  policy.  The  UPI  format  has  been  roundly 
criticized  and  thoroughly  discredited  by  several  respected  organizations,  including 
two  National  Academy  of  Sciences  Committees  that  considered  the  CAFE  program, 
the  Office  of  Technology  Assessment,  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice.  The  UPI 
format  would  create  unique  fuel  economy  standards  for  each  manufacturer,  based 
on  the  manufacturer’s  performance  in  a  base  year.  The  same  percentage  increase 
would  be  required  for  each  company,  but  the  actual  standards  differ  due  to  dif-
ferences in the fuel economy baselines. Under UPI standards, if two manufacturers 
were to produce the same mix of vehicle sizes and technology in the same year, one 
manufacturer  could  be  assessed  civil  penalties  while  the  other  could  be  awarded 
credits, due to differences in the two companies’ baselines. We believe that a system 
that  assigns  differing  compliance  consequences  to  the  same  conduct  by  two  entities 
is fundamentally discriminatory. 

Moreover, a UPI regulatory system would penalize those manufacturers that have 
exceeded CAFE standards, thereby discouraging any fuel economy accomplishments 
above  the  baseline  in  the  future.  The  approach  is  also  unfair  because  the  currently 
available  technology  for  improving  fuel  economy  might  already  have  been  incor-
porated  in  the  base  year  by  the  manufacturer  that  faces  the  most  stringent  future- 
year fuel economy requirements, leaving fewer technological options to increase fuel 
economy in the future. In addition, the selection of the base year could create arbi-
trary advantages or disadvantages for the manufacturers due to the product mix or 
technology  that  was  applied  by  the  manufacturers  in  that  year.  Under  a  UPI  sys-
tem, manufacturers with high average fuel economies would be impeded in entering 
U.S. markets for larger vehicles because such entry—even if they produce more effi-
cient larger vehicles than are currently available—could prevent them from meeting 
the new standards. Thus, competition would suffer and the fuel efficiency of a whole 
category of vehicles could be kept artificially low. 

AIAM supports the elimination of the domestic/import separate fleet requirement 
for  passenger  autos.  The  current  law  requires  dividing  a  manufacturer’s  passenger 
automobile fleet into domestic and import classes that must comply separately with 
fuel  economy  standards.  There  is  no  similar  requirement  for  light  trucks.  This  re-
quirement  was  originally  intended  to  inhibit  domestic  manufacturers  from  simply

43 

importing  large  numbers  of  small,  ‘‘captive  import’’  vehicles  as  a  compliance  strat-
egy.  This  provision  has  created  a  disincentive  for  foreign-based  companies  to  in-
crease  the  U.S.  content  of  their  vehicles  to  levels  above  75  percent,  since  doing  so 
would place the vehicles in a separate compliance fleet. This disincentive is real, not 
theoretical, and has cost U.S. jobs. This domestic/import separate fleet requirement 
has  also  had  the  perverse  effect  of  content  manipulation  to  move  a  model  from  a 
manufacturer’s  domestic  fleet  to  its  import  fleet.  Attribute-based  standards  remove 
any incentive for U.S.-based manufacturers to achieve compliance by simply import-
ing large numbers of very small vehicles. 

We  also  support  enhanced  trading  of  CAFE  credits  between  a  manufacturer’s 
fleets.  The  law  should  allow  credits  to  be  traded  between  import  and  domestic  pas-
senger  car  fleets  and  between  passenger  autos  and  light  trucks.  We  envision  this 
expanded credit trading authority as being conceptually consistent with the current 
authority for year-to-year transfer of credits. In the current system, credits are cal-
culated  as  the  product  of  a  number  of  tenths  of  a  mpg  by  which  the  standard  for 
a  class  of  vehicles  is  exceeded  multiplied  by  the  number  of  vehicles  in  the  credit 
earning class, with the total credit amount thus calculated being available to offset 
a  CAFE  shortfall.  This  approach  would  maintain  the  fleet  average  concept  that  is 
central  to  the  determination  of  compliance  under  the  existing  law.  The  carry-for-
ward  and  carry-back  provisions  in  current  law  should  also  in  our  view  be  extended 
from  3  years  to  5  years.  This  will  have  no  adverse  effect  on  fuel  savings  but  will 
provide  additional  compliance  flexibility.  Enhanced  credit  trading  has  been  rec-
ommended  by  the  NAS  as  a  means  of  increasing  manufacturers’  compliance  flexi-
bility while reducing costs. 

AIAM is concerned that state fuel economy standards or standards that are func-
tionally  equivalent  to  fuel  economy  standards  would  impose  severe  manufacturing 
and marketing burdens on manufacturers due to multiple inconsistent design or dis-
tribution  targets.  As  a  result  of  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in  Massachusetts  v. 
EPA,  NHTSA  has  authority  to  set  fuel  economy  standards  and  EPA  has  authority 
to  set  emission  standards.  We  believe  that  the  methods  for  complying  with  CAFE 
standards  and  with  carbon  dioxide  emissions  standards  are  so  similar  as  to  be  vir-
tually indistinguishable. AIAM favors a national program that avoids separate state 
requirements. Congress should address this issue as it moves forward. 

The effectiveness of CAFE would be significantly enhanced if coupled with appro-
priate,  market-based  incentives  for  consumers.  Tax  credits  for  advanced  technology 
vehicles are an example of an incentive that is potentially very effective. Such cred-
its are helpful in overcoming the effect of high initial costs of new technology, assist-
ing in stimulating sufficient demand for the new technology to allow production vol-
umes to increase to levels where costs begin to decrease. 

The  energy  security  and  climate  change  issues  are  real.  AIAM  and  its  members 
look forward to working with the Committee as it moves forward on this important 
subject. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Mr. Stanton. 
And now, may I recognize Admiral McGinn. 

STATEMENT  OF  VICE  ADMIRAL  DENNIS  MCGINN,  USN,  (RET.), 
SENIOR  VICE  PRESIDENT  AND  GENERAL  MANAGER, 
ENERGY,  TRANSPORTATION  AND  ENVIRONMENT  DIVISION, 
BATTELLE MEMORIAL INSTITUTE 
Admiral  MCGINN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chair-
man,  members  of  the  Committee.  It  is  an  honor  to  appear  before 
you  today  to  discuss  the  critically  important  need  for  tough  fuel 
economy  standards  based  on  the  imperatives  of  national  security, 
energy  dependence,  and  climate  change.  Today,  I’d  like  to  talk 
about  the  national  security  impacts  of  our  oil  dependency  right 
now, not in 10 years. 

In  my  view,  our  continued  dependence  on  oil  constitutes  a  clear 
and  present  danger  to  our  national  security,  economically,  mili-
tarily,  and  diplomatically.  The  United  States  consumes  25  percent 
of  the  world’s  annual  petroleum  production,  and  we  depend  on  oil 
to supply 97 percent of our transportation needs. Yet we only hold 
3 percent of the world’s oil reserves, and two-thirds of the reserves

are  situated  in  that  core  of  global  instability,  the  Persian  Gulf. 
Even  if  we  tapped  every  last  drop  of  oil  on  our  soils  and  off  our 
shores,  we  could  still  not  produce  enough  to  meet  U.S.  oil  demand 
in the present business-as-usual mode. 

Our burgeoning demand for oil weakens U.S. diplomatic leverage 
around  the  globe,  burdens  our  Armed  Forces,  and  leaves  the  U.S. 
economy  vulnerable  to  unpredictable  price  spikes  and  an  ever- 
growing  trade  imbalance.  Taken  together,  these  dynamics  create  a 
daunting  national  security  challenge  that  must  be  met  imme-
diately. 

Terrorist  networks  have  openly  called  for,  planned,  and  carried 
out attacks on the global oil infrastructure, because they know that 
oil  is  the  economic  lifeblood  of  the  U.S.  and  the  world’s  economy. 
Just  last  week,  a  major  oil  infrastructure  attack  plan  was  dis-
rupted  by  Saudi  Arabia  at  the  11th  hour.  Had  it  been  successful, 
the  adverse  consequences  would  likely  have  been  severe,  imme-
diate, and felt around the globe. 

Our  fine  men  and  women  in  the  Armed  Forces  serve  our  Nation 
with  honor  protecting  American  interests  abroad.  The  major  focus 
of  their  activities  for  nearly  30  years  has  centered  in  the  Middle 
East,  a  region  from  which  so  much  of  the  instability,  strife,  root 
causes of terrorism, and Persian Gulf oil flow. 

The  economic  impact  of  our  oil  dependency  threatens  our  na-
tional security, as well. We lose $25 billion from our economy every 
month,  at  a  rate  of  $500,000  a  minute.  And  oil  imports  now  ac-
count  for  nearly  a  third  of  our  Nation’s  trade  deficit.  Our  economy 
is exposed on a daily basis to oil shocks and supply disruptions. Re-
gardless  of  how  they  are  caused—by  global  market  dynamics,  nat-
ural  disasters,  terrorist  attacks,  or  politically  motivated  oil  embar-
goes—our  economy  grows  more  vulnerable  each  day.  The  trends  of 
our  growing  oil  demand  in  a  business-as-usual  mode  will  make 
those  price  shocks  much  more  frequent,  more  deeply  felt,  and 
longer-lasting. 

There’s  a  great  urgency  to  reverse  this  dependence  on  oil,  and 
this  urgency  is  twofold.  Our  dependency  on  unfriendly  regimes  is 
increasing,  not  decreasing,  and  the  impacts  of  global  warming 
emissions,  if  not  swiftly  and  significantly  reduced,  will  have  pro-
foundly negative national security impacts. According to top retired 
military leaders in a recent report from the Center for Naval Anal-
ysis,  global  warming  poses  a,  ‘‘serious  threat  to  America’s  national 
security,’’ acting as a, ‘‘threat multiplier for instability,’’ in some of 
the world’s most volatile regions, adding tensions to stable regimes, 
worsening  terrorism,  and  likely  dragging  the  U.S.  into  fights  over 
water and other resources shortages. 

We  need  to  solve  our  oil  dependency  problem  within  the  context 
of  global  warming,  and  the  solution  must  include  tough  fuel  econ-
omy standards for vehicles. In this regard, Corporate Average Fuel 
Economy  standards  have  proven  to  work.  After  Congress  set  fuel 
economy  standards  for  vehicles  in  1975,  our  dependence  on  oil  im-
ports decreased very quickly, from 46 percent in 1977 to 27 percent 
in 1985, even though the price of oil fell in 1981. 

Ten  years  of  CAFE  progress  saved  the  U.S.  billions  in  oil  and 
money.  Without  those  standards  that  motivated  automakers  to  in-
crease  fuel  economy  from  the  1975  level  to  today’s  average  of  25

miles per gallon, we would be using an additional 80 billion gallons 
of gasoline each year. At today’s average price for regular gasoline, 
about  $2.75  a  gallon,  that  represents  $220  billion  saved.  If  CAFE 
had  not  stalled  after  1985,  the  U.S.  would  have  saved  additional 
billions  more  in  oil  and  dollars,  especially  in  light  of  tremendous 
advances  in  technology  available  to  improve  vehicle  fuel  economy 
for both cars and light trucks. 

Americans,  as  has  been  pointed  out  earlier,  do  not  have  to  sac-
rifice safety, comfort, or utility in their vehicles in order to achieve 
much  greater  fuel  economy.  The  technology  advances  that  have 
been  primarily  used  to  increase  power  and  weight  can  now  be  di-
rected to fuel economy. Data in the 2002 report on CAFE standards 
by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  that  Senator  Levin  men-
tioned in the previous panel, on CAFE indicate that technology ex-
ists to reach 37 miles per gallon in a fleet of the same make-up as 
the one that the National Academy analyzed, even ignoring hybrids 
and  cleaner  diesels.  And  I  would  make  the  comment  that  in  my 
view,  tough  CAFE  standards  do  not  preclude  leap-ahead  tech-
nologies;  in  fact,  they  motivate  the  auto  industry  to  produce  them. 
One  of  the  most  important  steps  that  Congress  can  take  now  to 
avert the worst consequences of oil dependency and global warming 
is to substantially raise fuel economy standards. As we have in our 
Nation’s  past  struggles,  dedicated  and  concerned  Americans  from 
every part of the country want to play a role in decisively meeting 
the  energy  and  environmental  challenges  which  we  already  face 
and which grow greater every year we delay taking action. 

The  key  questions,  in  my  mind,  for  this  hearing,  and  as  various 
legislative  proposals  move  forward,  are:  How  will  the  actions  on 
CAFE  by  this  Congress  be  viewed  in  10  or  20  years?  Will  we  be 
able to look back and say that a bold, comprehensive, and enlight-
ened  mandate  produced  substantial  oil  savings,  increased  our  na-
tional  security,  helped  our  economy,  and  significantly  reduced  car-
bon emissions? 

We  have  less  than  10  years  to  change  our  course  in  significant 
ways.  Our  Nation’s  security  depends  on  the  swift,  serious,  and 
thoughtful response to these challenges by you, our elected officials. 
Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chairman,  and  members  of 

the Committee. I look forward to your questions.

Our continued dependence on oil constitutes a clear and present danger to our na-

tional security—economically, militarily and diplomatically. 

tion and depends on oil to supply 97 percent of its transportation fuels. 

• Data  from  the  Energy  Information  Administration  indicates  that  we  imported 
about  60  percent  of  our  oil  and  other  petroleum  products  in  2006.  Last  year 
alone, our net imports were more than 12 million barrels per day. 
• The United States consumes 25 percent of the world’s annual petroleum produc-
• Yet  the  U.S.  holds  only  3  percent  of  the  world’s  oil  reserves,  while  two-thirds 
of reserves are situated in that core of global instability, the Persian Gulf. Even 
if we tapped every last drop of oil in our soils and waters, we could not produce 
enough to meet U.S. oil demand. 
• As a key leader of the global economic community, we must rely on foreign en-
ergy sources, with many of them in hostile, unstable regions, to provide us with 
our economic lifeblood and quality of life. 
• Our  burgeoning  demand  for  oil  weakens  U.S.  diplomatic  leverage  around  the 
globe, burdens our armed forces and leaves the U.S. economy vulnerable to un-
predictable  price  spikes  and  an  ever  growing  trade  imbalance.  Taken  together, 
these dynamics create a daunting national security challenge that must be met 
immediately. 

U.S.  oil  dependency  weakens  U.S.  leverage,  undermines  foreign  policy  and  leaves 

us vulnerable to unstable or hostile regimes. 

• According  to  a  new  Rice  University  study,  77  percent  of  the  world’s  1.148  tril-
lion  barrels  of  proven  reserves  are  in  the  hands  of  the  national  companies;  14 
of the top 20 oil-producing companies are state-controlled.1 
• With  oil  at  $60  a  barrel,  $500,000  a  minute  is  flowing  out  of  our  country,  in-
creasing  our  trade  deficit,  creating  huge  opportunity  costs  and,  most  signifi-
cantly,  putting  money  into  the  hands  of  some  regimes  that  are  hostile  to  our 
interests. 
• Last  year  Iran’s  supreme  leader,  Ayatollah  Ali  Khomeini  warned  that  ‘‘if  the 
Americans  make  a  wrong  move  toward  Iran,  the  shipment  of  energy  will  defi-
nitely  face  danger  and  the  Americans  would  not  be  able  to  protect  energy  sup-
ply in the region.’’ 2 
• In  the  southern  hemisphere,  we  seem  to  be  on  a  collision  course  with  Ven-
ezuela’s President Huge Chavez over access to some of the most coveted energy 
resources outside the Middle East. Chavez represents a direct threat to the ad-
vances  of  democracy  and  free  markets  in  our  Hemisphere.  The  false  promises 
of  his  populist  appeal  in  Latin  America  have  been  compared  with  the  pan- 
Arabism of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya two decades ago.3 
• Terrorist  networks  have  openly  called  for,  planned  and  carried  out  attacks  on 
the  global  oil  infrastructure  because  they  know  oil  is  the  economic  lifeblood  of 
the U.S. and the world’s economy. Just last week, a major oil infrastructure at-
tack plan was disrupted in Saudi Arabia at the eleventh hour. Had it been suc-
cessful,  the  adverse  consequences  would  have  been  severe,  global  and  imme-
diate. 
• By enriching the coffers of fundamentalist regimes with our gasoline purchases, 
we  are  inadvertently  financing,  but  directly  enabling,  the  spread  of  a  flawed 
and deadly brand of Islam which is tilting key regions in a more intolerant and 
dangerous direction.4 

U.S. oil dependency burdens our military forces and exacts a huge price tag in pro-
tecting sea-lanes, military bases of operations and maintaining continuous high level 
of forward presence. 

• Our  fine  men  and  women  in  the  Armed  Forces  serve  our  Nation  with  honor, 
protecting American interests throughout the globe. The major focus of their ac-
tivities  for  nearly  thirty  years  has  centered  in  the  Middle  East,  a  region  from 
which  so  much  of  the  instability,  strife,  root  causes  of  terrorism  and  Persian 
Gulf oil flow. 
• The October 2000 terrorist attack on the USS COLE, while on a refueling stop 
in Yemen, was a tragic reminder of the convergence of oil, instability, terrorism, 
and  the  need  for  ever  vigilant  presence  by  American  servicemen  and  women 
who are forward deployed. 
• Recent energy-market disruptions and increasing awareness of the vulnerability 
and insecurity of supplies world-wide have added urgency to the U.S. military’s 
efforts to curb its use of oil and other fuels.5

• One  study  estimates  that  in  peacetime  the  ‘‘true’’  cost  of  oil  in  a  given  year  is 

$800 billion dollars, assuming 2004 oil prices. 

• Retired  Air  Force  General  Charles  Wald  estimates  that  if  the  true  cost  of  mili-
tary  security  were  incorporated  into  the  price  of  gasoline,  we  would  be  paying 
between $6.50 and $7 a gallon. 

The economic impact of our oil dependency threatens national security. 
• We lose $25 billion from our economy every month, and oil imports now account 
for  nearly  a  third  of  our  Nation’s  trade  deficit.  Our  economy  is  exposed  on  a 
daily  basis  to  oil  price  shocks  and  supply  disruptions.  Regardless  of  how  they 
are  caused,  by  global  market  dynamics,  natural  disasters,  terrorist  attacks,  or 
politically  motivated  oil  embargoes,  the  trends  of  our  growing  oil  demand  in  a 
‘‘business  as  usual’’  mode  will  make  those  price  shocks  much  more  frequent, 
deeply felt and longer lasting. 

• Every event overseas—Iran’s capture of British soldiers, Nigeria rebels warn of 
attacks  on  oil  industry—causes  our  stock  market  to  roil.  Just  last  week,  oil 
prices surged causing stocks to tumble in response to political turmoil and pos-
sible  election  fraud  in  Nigeria  underscoring  our  daily  vulnerability  resulting 
from oil dependency.6 

• There are nightmare scenarios—much more than conjecture at this point—that 
are already having an impact on our economy. The Wall Street Journal recently 
wrote  about  oil  traders’  concern  over  an  obstruction  of  oil  traffic  through  the 
Persian  Gulf.  Under  the  scenario,  Iran,  in  a  bid  to  preempt  or  respond  to  U.S. 
military  action,  closes  the  Strait  of  Hormuz,  the  Persian  Gulf  chokepoint 
through  which  20  percent  of  the  world’s  oil  supply  passes.  The  consequence 
would be swift: by most experts’ reckoning, oil prices would soar to $100 a bar-
rel and even higher, potentially plunging the world economy into a depression.7 
• A  Wall  Street  Journal  survey  of  economists  found  strong  support  for  govern-
ment  intervention  in  the  transition  away  from  fossil  fuels.  When  asked  to  pick 
the  greater  geopolitical  threat  to  the  economy,  by  nearly  a  3-to-1  margin  the 
economists  chose  a  disruption  in  crude  oil  supplies  caused  by  tensions  in  the 
Mideast  over  the  impact  on  spending  and  confidence  that  could  follow  a  major 
terrorist attack.8 

Our oil consumption puts money in pocket of terrorists. 
• Former  Republic  National  Committee  Director  of  Communications  Clifford  D. 
May  wrote,  ‘‘Every  time  we  fill  the  tanks  of  our  cars  with  gasoline  we  put 
money in the pockets of terrorists intent on killing Americans.’’ 9 

There is great urgency to reverse our dependence on oil. 

The urgency is two-fold. As a result of our increasing oil consumption: (1) Our de-
pendency  on  unfriendly  regimes  is  increasing  not  decreasing;  (2)  The  impacts  of 
global  warming  emissions,  if  not  swiftly  and  significantly  reduced,  will  have  pro-
foundly negative national security impacts. 

The  world  oil  supply  is  tightening  as  demand  surges  leaving  little  elasticity  in  a 

very volatile market and creating increased U.S. reliance on the Middle East. 

• Energy analysts expect global oil-demand growth to surge this year to an addi-
tional 1.39 million barrels a day from growth of 800,000 bpd in 2006, according 
to  a  new  Reuters’  poll.  OPEC’s  biggest  producer,  Saudi  Arabia,  may  be  incapa-
ble of raising its production any time soon.10 

• Government data shows U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles are much lower than 

analysts had forecast.11 

• Oil analysts say that the market has not fully recognized the constraints on oil 
supply in Venezuela, Iran and Kazakhstan. Other factors favoring higher prices: 
rapidly  rising  demand  in  China  and  India,  and  the  location  of  much  of  the 
world’s oil reserves in politically volatile and unstable countries.12 

• Mexico’s  oilfield  Cantarell—one  of  the  largest  offshore  oil  fields  ever  found—is 
dying,  losing  a  staggering  one-fifth  of  its  production,  with  daily  output  falling 
to  1.6  million  barrels  from  two  million  within  the  last  year.  Cantarell,  which 
currently produces one of every 50 barrels of oil on the world market, is fading 
so fast analysts believe Mexico may become an oil importer in 8 years.13 

• The  continued  deterioration  of  the  world’s  second-biggest  field  by  output  puts 
pressure  on  prices  on  the  global  oil  market,  where  supplies  are  barely  keeping 
up with growing demand as it is. Our growing dependence would leave the U.S.

even  more  dependent  on  Middle  Eastern  supplies—and  that  much  more  vulner-
able to political tumult in that region.14 

• Some  predict  we  will  reach  peak  of  oil  production  within  a  few  years,  others 
say peak oil won’t arrive until 2030 or later. In either case, our demand is going 
in  the  opposite  direction  while  oil  is  getting  harder  and  more  expensive  to  ex-
tract. 

OPEC,  which  added  Angola  as  its  newest  member  this  year,  will  likely  see  its 
clout  reinforced  in  coming  years  as  it  is  poised  to  control  more  than  50  percent  of 
the oil market in coming years, up from 35 percent today.15 
The threat of climate change is a national security matter. 

Climate change acts as a threat multiplier for instability in some of the most vola-

tile regions of the world. 

• According to top retired military leaders in a recent report from the Center for 
Naval  Analysis,  global  warming  poses  a  ‘‘serious  threat  to  America’s  national 
security’’,  acting  as  a  ‘‘threat  multiplier  for  instability’’  in  some  of  the  world’s 
most volatile regions, adding tension to stable regions, worsening terrorism and 
likely dragging the U.S. into fights over water and other resource shortages. On 
the simplest level, it has the potential to create sustained natural and humani-
tarian disasters on a scale far beyond those we see today. The consequences will 
likely  foster  political  instability  where  societal  demands  exceed  the  capacity  of 
governments to cope.16 

• Climate  change  is  different  from  traditional  military  threats,  according  to 
C.N.A. report author Vice Admiral Richard H. Truly because it is not like ‘‘some 
hot  spot  we’re  trying  to  handle.’’  ‘‘It’s  going  to  happen  to  every  country  and 
every person in the whole world at the same time.’’ 17 

• Not  only  will  global  warming  disrupt  the  environment,  but  its  effects  will  shift 

the world’s balance of power and money.18 

• Drought  and  scant  water  have  already  fueled  civil  conflicts  in  global  hot  spots 
like  Afghanistan,  Nepal  and  Sudan,  according  to  several  new  studies.  The  evi-
dence  is  fairly  clear  that  sharp  downward  deviations  from  normal  rainfall  in 
fragile societies elevate the risk of major conflict, according to experts at Colum-
bia University.19 

• The world’s leading scientific panel on climate change—including more than 200 
scientists and officials from more than 120 countries and the U.S.—released its 
most  detailed  portrait  on  the  impacts  of  human  induced  climate  change,  pre-
dicting  widening  droughts  in  southern  Europe  and  the  Middle  East,  sub-Saha-
ran Africa, the American Southwest and Mexico, and flooding that could imperil 
low-lying islands and the crowded river deltas of southern Asia.20 

• Without  action  to  curb  carbon  emissions,  man’s  livable  habitat  will  shrink 
starkly,  said  Stephen  Schneider,  a  Stanford  scientist  and  IPCC  report  author. 
‘‘Don’t  be  poor  in  a  hot  country,  don’t  live  in  hurricane  alley,  watch  out  about 
being on the coasts or in the Arctic, and it’s a bad idea to be on high mountains 
with glaciers melting.’’ ‘‘We can fix this,’’ by investing a small part of the world’s 
economic  growth  rate,  said  Schneider.  ‘‘It’s  trillions  of  dollars,  but  it’s  a  very 
trivial thing.’’ 21 

• James  Hansen,  a  pioneering  climate  researcher  at  NASA’s  Goddard  Institute 
and  at  Columbia  University,  says,  ‘‘If  human  beings  follow  a  business-as-usual 
course, continuing to exploit fossil fuel resources without reducing carbon emis-
sions or capturing and sequestering them before they warm the atmosphere, the 
eventual  effects  on  climate  and  life  may  be  comparable  to  those  at  the  time  of 
mass extinctions.’’ 22 

Ignoring global warming undermines U.S. international leadership and influence. 
• The  United  States  will  emit  about  20  percent  more  greenhouse  gases  by  2020 
than  it  did  in  2000,  according  to  a  draft  report  that  the  Bush  administration 
was scheduled to submit to the United Nations a year ago. 23 

• Recently  the  U.N.  Security  Council  held  its  first-ever  discussion  of  the  link  be-
tween  climate  change  and  international  conflict.  An  overwhelming  majority  of 
nations  voiced  grave  concerns  about  climate  change  and  many  urged  stricter 
worldwide controls on greenhouse gases. 24 

• The harmful effects of global warming on daily life are already showing up, and 
within  a  couple  of  decades  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  will  not  have  enough 
water,  according  to  the  authoritative  IPCC.  ‘‘Things  are  happening  and  hap-

pening  faster  than  we  expected,’’  said  Patricia  Romero  Lankao  of  the  National 
Center for Atmospheric Research, a report co-author.25

Climate change, national security, and energy dependence are an interrelated set 
of global challenges. As President Bush noted in his 2007 State of the Union speech, 
dependence  on  foreign  oil  leaves  us  more  vulnerable  to  hostile  regimes  and  terror-
ists,  and  clean  domestic  energy  alternatives  help  us  confront  the  serious  challenge 
of  global  climate  change.  Because  the  issues  are  linked,  solutions  to  one  affect  the 
other.  Technologies  that  improve  energy  efficiency  also  reduce  carbon  intensity  and 
carbon emissions.26 

Without swift and serious legislative action and investment, the U.S. will continue 
barreling  headlong  toward  the  catastrophic  national  security,  economic  and  human 
suffering effects of climate change. 

As  retired  Marin  Corps  General  Anthony  C.  Zinni,  former  Commander  of  U.S. 
Central  Command  said  ‘‘The  intensity  of  global  temperature  change  can  be  miti-
gated  somewhat  if  the  U.S.  begins  leading  the  way  in  reducing  global  carbon  emis-
sions.’’  He  concluded  ‘‘We  will  pay  now  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  today 
. . .  or  we  will  pay  the  price  later  in  military  terms  and  that  will  involve  human 
lives.’’ 27 
Key principles for reducing oil dependence and greenhouse gas emissions. 

First  and  foremost,  the  size  and  speed  of  the  solution  must  match  the  size  and 

speed of the problem. 

We must solve our oil dependency problem within the context of global warming— 

to do otherwise would be at the risk of our national security. 

The  solution  must  include  both  market  and  mandates.  We  cannot  do  one  without 

the other. 

Key  players  in  the  global  market  are  already  responding  to  their  perception  of 
regulation certainty. The right kind of regulations can create certainty and spur the 
market  to  a  much  more  stable  and  productive  future.  Leading  international  busi-
nesses, investors and industry sectors recognize this fact and are asking for market 
certainty through an effective, long-term cap on emissions. 

• ConocoPhillips  recently  became  the  first  U.S.-based  oil  company  to  join  ten  of 
the Nation’s largest companies, including GE, DuPont and Duke Energy, to call 
for mandatory cuts in global warming emissions. Such action likely means high-
er  costs  for  these  companies,  but  they  fear  the  Administration’s  failure  to  en-
gage will leave them with a hodgepodge of state and foreign restrictions.28 

rectly account for more than 40 percent of our oil dependency. 

The solution must include fuel economy standards for vehicles. 
• Vehicles  are  the  source  of  20  percent  of  U.S.  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  di-
• By mid-century, the world’s vehicle population is expected to reach 2 billion, al-
most  triple  the  current  figure.  To  limit  global  vehicle  emissions  to  50  percent 
more  than  today’s  levels,  the  average  fuel  economy  of  cars  and  trucks  on  the 
road  would  have  to  rise  to  about  60  mpg  in  50  years  or  less,  according  to  cal-
culations  by  the  Carbon  Mitigation  Initiative  at  Princeton  University,  a  re-
search  effort  funded  in  part  by  Ford.  Because  it  takes  a  decade  or  two  for  new 
technology  to  make  it  into  every  car  on  the  road,  all  new  vehicles  within  35 
years or less would need to reach 60 mpg.29 
• Yet,  as  a  new  report  from  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration 
(NHTSA) reveals, the average fuel efficiency of U.S. cars and trucks sold in the 
2006  model  year  showed  no  improvement  from  the  year  before  at  25.4  mpg.30 

Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards (CAFE) work. 
• After Congress set fuel economy standards for vehicles in 1975, our dependence 
on  oil  imports  decreased  very  quickly  from  46  percent  in  1977  to  27  percent  in 
1985, even though the price of oil fell in 1981. 
• Ten years of CAFE saved the U.S. billions in oil and money. Without standards 
that  forced  automakers  to  increase  fuel  economy  from  the  1975  level  to  today’s 
25  mpg,  we  would  be  using  an  additional  80  billion  gallons  of  gasoline  on  top 
of  the  140  billion  gallons  we  will  use  this  year.  That  would  represent  an  in-
crease  in  oil  demand  by  5.2  million  barrels  of  oil  per  day,  or  a  25  percent  in-
crease  in  our  oil  addiction.  At  today’s  average  price  for  regular  gasoline,  about 
$2.75 per gallon, that represents $220 billion saved. 
• Even today, these standards continue to save nearly 3 million barrels of oil per 
day, according to the National Academies of Sciences. Since 1985, however, fuel 
economy has been stagnant and our imports have grown.

50 

• IF  CAFE  hadn’t  stalled  after  1985,  the  U.S.  would  have  saved  additional  bil-
lions more in oil and dollars, especially in light of tremendous advances in tech-
nology available to improve fuel economy. 

• The  United  States  is  falling  behind  other  nations  pushing  for  better  fuel  econ-
omy as concerns mount over global warming. Even China, oft touted as the rea-
son why the U.S. shouldn’t act, has tougher fuel economy standards.31 

Voluntary action does not work. 
• Automakers did not meet voluntary agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions  in  Europe.  As  a  result,  the  European  Commission  in  Brussels  is  moving 
to  mandate  automakers  to  limit  carbon  dioxide  emission  to  an  average  of  130 
grams per kilometer for all new cars by 2012.32 

Detroit plays a critical role in reducing U.S. dependency on oil. 
• James  Hansen  of  NASA’s  Goddard  Institute  and  at  Columbia  University,  says 
that the biggest obstacles to avoiding greater climate disaster are utility plants 
and motor vehicles that inefficiently use too much fuel. ‘‘Automakers oppose ef-
ficiency  standards  and  prominently  advertise  their  heaviest  and  most  powerful 
vehicles, which yield the greatest short-term profits,’’ according to Hansen.33 

• A  recent  draft  report  from  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  finds 
that the U.S. transportation sector accounts for about a third of greenhouse gas 
emissions  and  is  the  fastest  growing  major  source  of  greenhouse  gases,  accord-
ing to a recent summary.34 

• The  automotive  industry  is  in  a  period  of  unprecedented  technology  develop-
ment  but  up  to  now,  domestic  automakers  have  used  technology  advances  to 
nearly  double  power  and  increase  weight  by  twenty-five  percent  instead  of  in-
creasing fuel economy.35 

• Americans do not have to sacrifice safety, comfort or utility in their vehicles in 
order to achieve much greater fuel economy. The technology advances that have 
been  used  for  power  and  weight  can  now  be  directed  to  fuel  economy.  Data  in 
the  2002  report  by  the  National  Academies  of  Sciences  on  CAFE  indicate  that 
the  technology  exists  to  reach  37  mpg  in  a  fleet  of  the  same  make-up  as  the 
NAS analyzed, even ignoring hybrids and cleaner diesels.36 

• Paul Portney, Chair of the NAS committee, noted that, ‘‘It might be possible to 
meet more stringent fuel economy standards at lower costs than the Committee 
foresaw.’’ 37 

Detroit’s future competitiveness requires a more fuel-efficient fleet. 
• Toyota just unseated GM as the world’s number one automaker, shattering sev-
eral  sales  records,  as  domestic  automakers  continue  to  lose  sales  and  market 
share due to an over-reliance on fuel-inefficient cars and trucks, continuing the 
trend of the last 2 years.38 

• Dr.  Walter  McManus,  a  former  GM  market  analyst  now  at  the  University  of 
Michigan, reported recently that if U.S. automakers increased their vehicle fuel 
efficiency  to  accommodate  increasingly  conservation-minded  customers,  they 
could  collectively  increase  profitability  by  $2  billion  in  model  year  2010.  Fol-
lowing  their  current  plans,  Dr.  McManus  concluded,  they  are  projected  to  lose 
$3.6 billion that year.39 

The  American  people,  and  Michigan  citizens,  specifically,  want  the  government  to 

take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase fuel economy. 

• A  new  Gallup  poll  shows  overwhelming  support  to  strengthen  government  re-
strictions  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  to  spend  more  taxpayer  money  to 
develop  alternative  energy  sources,  with  79  percent  supporting  higher  auto 
emissions standards.40 
• The  latest  Detroit  Free  Press-Local  4  Michigan  Poll  shows  a  majority  of  Michi-
gan citizens favor higher fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, with some 
supporting increases to 40 miles per gallon or more. Many would pay hundreds 
of  dollars  extra  for  more  efficient  vehicles.  When  asked  how  much  they  would 
be willing to pay for an 8 mpg improvement in fuel economy for vehicles similar 
to what they drive now, 47 percent said they would pay $1,000 to $2,000 more, 
and 20 percent said $500 to $700.41 
• Forty-six percent of today’s car shoppers say the feds ought to force automakers 
to meet higher fuel economy standards, according to Kelly Blue Book Marketing 
Research.42

• There  is  ‘‘a  significant  shift  in  public  attitudes  toward  the  environment  and 
global warming [with] fully 83 percent of Americans now saying global warming 
is a ‘serious’ problem, up from 70 percent in 2004,’’ reports the Yale Center for 
Environmental Law and Policy.43 

Policy Recommendations 

We can no longer afford any aspect of energy policy that undermines our national 
security  by  funneling  billions  of  dollars  to  our  enemies  around  the  world,  and  con-
tinues to increase emissions of heat trapping gases that cause global warming. Our 
oil  dependence  and  global  warming  problem  require  immediate  and  comprehensive 
action from Congress in order to address both challenges together. 

Scientists  warn  that  we  have  only  a  short  window  for  action  to  prevent  cata-
strophic  global  warming.  Delay—as  many  recent  economic  studies  reveal  in  sharp 
relief—would  make  emissions  reduction  more  difficult  and  more  costly  than  action 
now. 

One  of  the  most  important  steps  Congress  can  take  now  to  avert  the  worst  con-

sequences is to substantially raise fuel economy standards. 

In  the  immediate  term,  I  urge  the  Congress  to  raise  vehicle  fuel  economy  stand-
ards to at least 35 miles per gallon by 2018—the level recommended by the National 
Academies of Sciences and consistent with the President’s proposal of 4 percent per 
year improvement. 

By  making  this  level  of  improvement  binding,  rather  than  leaving  it  up  to  this 
or  future  administrations,  we  could  save  as  much  oil  as  we  currently  import  from 
the Persian Gulf, benefiting our economy and our long-term strategic interests. 

Congress  should  follow  key  steps  to  realize  substantial  oil  savings  and  emission 

reduction benefits from available vehicle technology: 

1.  Require  at  least  35  mile  per  gallon  fuel  economy  for  cars  and  light  trucks 
by 2018, and regular rate of improvement thereafter. 
2.  Give  the  administration  flexibility  to  restructure  the  standard,  but  do  not 
leave goal-setting up to the administration. The only way to ensure guaranteed 
oil  savings  is  for  Congress  to  direct  the  Department  of  Transportation  and 
NHTSA to raise standards to a certain level. 
3.  Provide  consumers  and/or  automakers  with  economic  incentives  to  invest  in 
technology for increasing fleet wide fuel economy. 

Current  Congressional  proposals  will  have  significant  impact  on  our  oil  depend-

ency. 

As  the  chart  below  shows,  a  4  percent  per  year  increase  in  vehicle  efficiency  will 
produce significant savings and will make real progress in reducing our dependency 
on imported oil.

As next chart shows, while a 4 percent per year path would still leave us 7 years 
behind  Australia,  9  years  behind  China,  and  more  than  15  years  behind  the  Euro-
pean  Union,  the  4  percent  per  year  path  would  cut  oil  dependence,  slow  global 
warming, and save American consumers billions at the pump. 

Conclusion 

Our actions as Americans cannot stop with these measures. As noted earlier—the 

size and speed of the solution must match the size and speed of the problem. 

Throughout  our  history,  Americans  have  successfully  met  critical  challenges  in 
both  war  and  peace.  Building  a  new,  clean  energy  economy  has  become  one  of  the 
great  challenges  of  our  time.  Together  we  can  move  our  Nation  toward  clean  and 
secure  energy  supplies  with  policies  that  promote  energy  efficiency  and  the  greatly 
increased  the  use  of  renewable  energy.  As  we  have  in  our  Nation’s  past  struggles, 
dedicated  and  concerned  Americans  from  every  part  of  the  country  want  to  play  a 
key role in decisively winning the energy and environmental victory. 

How  will  the  actions  on  CAFE  by  this  Congress  be  viewed  in  ten  or  twenty 
years? Will we be able to look back and say that a bold, comprehensive and en-
lightened  mandate  produced  substantial  oil  savings,  increased  our  national  se-
curity, helped our economy and significantly reduced carbon emissions? 

We have 10 years to change course in significant ways. Our Nation’s security de-
pends  on  the  swift,  serious  and  thoughtful  response  of  you,  our  elected  leaders  in 
Congress. 

Thank you.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Admiral McGinn. 
Now may I call upon Mr. McCurdy? 

STATEMENT OF DAVE MCCURDY, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS 

Mr. MCCURDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
And  I  thank  my  colleagues.  At  one  point,  I  counted  six  of  my 

former colleagues on the panel. 

As  an  introduction,  I  want  to  make  it  clear  that  it’s  the  view  of 
the  Alliance  of  Automobile  Manufacturers  that  enhancing  energy 
security and reducing carbon dioxide emissions are priorities to all 
Americans  and  the  auto  industry,  which  must  continue  to  aggres-
sively pursue our innovation agenda. 

In  a  March  14th  House  Energy  and  Commerce  Committee  hear-
ing,  CEOs  from  DaimlerChrysler,  Ford  Motor  Company,  General 
Motors, and Toyota all committed to working with Congress to find 
new  ways  to  address  the  issues  of  climate  change  and  fuel  econ-
omy.  I’m  here  today  to  share  that  message  with  this  Committee. 
As  a  former  Member  of  Congress  with  an  extensive  national  se-
curity  background—I  notice  that  Admiral  McGinn  mentioned  the 
CNA  report;  I  serve  on  their  Defense  Advisory  Board—I’m  very 
sensitive  to  how  our  dependence  on  foreign  sources  of  oil  impacts 
our  foreign  policy.  However,  autos  are  only  one  part  of  our  energy 
security picture. 

Alliance  members  support  enhancing  energy  security,  promoting 
fuel  diversity,  and  increasing  fuel  efficiency  through  accelerating 
the availability of the growing number of advanced technology and 
alternative  fuel  automobiles  in  the  market.  Alternative  fuel  autos, 
including vehicles that run on biofuels, diesel, electricity, hydrogen, 
natural gas, and others, will help our country address the growing 
concerns about U.S. gasoline consumption and oil imports. 

Today  10.5  million  alternative  fuel  vehicles  are  already  on  the 
road,  and  the  Alliance  members  are  offering  more  for  sale  this 
year.  Additionally,  there  are  60  models  of  alternative  fuel  vehicles 
on  sale  today,  up  from  12  in  2000,  and  many  more  models  are 
planned for future production. 

However,  many  substantial  infrastructure  and  technology  chal-
lenges  need  to  be  overcome  before  the  promise  of  alternative-fuel 
automobiles  can  be  fully  realized.  Thousands  of  automotive  engi-
neers are working on innovative technologies every single day, but 
many  promising  technologies,  such  as  plug-in  hybrids  and  fuel 
cells,  still  need  significant  research  and  development  before  they 
will be commercially ready. 

Federal  and  State  incentives  for  consumers  who  purchase  alter-
native-fuel  automobiles  and  incentives  to  help  expand  the  alter-
native-fuel  infrastructure  will  help  accelerate  the  continued  intro-
duction of these highly fuel-efficient vehicles. Working together, we

believe that government and industry can put more alternative-fuel 
automobiles on our roadways. 

We’ve been talking about CAFE, enacted in 1975. But, as history 
has shown, the U.S. cannot achieve energy security through CAFE 
alone.  CAFE  is  a  one-dimensional  and  incomplete  program.  Addi-
tionally,  higher  CAFE  standards  would  have  no  near-term  impact 
on gasoline use. First, increases in the size of the overall fleet, and 
the  number  of  vehicle  miles  traveled  each  year,  are  far  greater 
influencers of U.S. oil consumption and gasoline prices than CAFE 
requirements.  Because  CAFE  is  based  on  the  mix  of  vehicles  sold 
each  year,  whether  a  manufacturer  meets  the  CAFE  standard  or 
not depends both on what products are offered and, as importantly, 
on what products consumers purchase. And, while consumers value 
fuel economy, they also want many other attributes in today’s vehi-
cles, such as safety, passenger and cargo room performance, towing 
and hauling capacity, and others. Our challenge is to develop vehi-
cles that combine these attributes with improved fuel efficiency and 
an affordable price. 

Automakers  offer  close  to  200  models  that  have  an  EPA  esti-
mated  highway  rating  of  30  miles  per  gallon  or  more;  however, 
each  year  since  2001,  American  consumers  have  purchased  more 
light trucks than passenger cars. By failing to take into account the 
cost of fuel and consumer buying habits, CAFE addresses only one 
component  of  the  fuel  economy  equation.  Consumers  value  fuel 
economy,  but  they  typically  value  more  attributes  of  the  vehicles 
that they purchase. 

Regarding S. 357, as well as S. 183 and S. 1118, the most impor-
tant  message  of  Alliance  members  is  very  clear.  And,  Mr.  Chair-
man,  this  may  actually  come  as  a  shock  to  some,  but  we  support 
improving fuel efficiency to the maximum feasible level. Improving 
fuel  economy  is  a  consumer  issue,  an  economic  issue,  a  climate 
change  issue,  and  an  energy  security  issue,  and,  thus,  a  priority. 
The  Alliance  supports  NHTSA  obtaining  the  authority  to  reform 
the  CAFE  standard  for  cars  into  an  attribute-based  system,  as 
we’ve  heard  today.  The  Alliance,  however,  opposes  legislation  that 
is  not  technologically  feasible,  because  of  the  proposed  arbitrary 
CAFE target and/or the proposed arbitrary lead time. 

The  Alliance  believes  Congress  should  look  beyond  CAFE,  and 
should consider a multisector integrated transportation energy pol-
icy  that  motivates  all  stakeholders  to  make  decisions  consistent 
with  the  shared  goal  of  reducing  petroleum  imports.  An  effective 
transportation  energy  policy  needs  to  foster  more  alternative-fuel 
choices,  especially  more  low-carbon  renewable  fuels;  implement  an 
aggressive  program  to  enhance  the  alternative  fuels  infrastructure 
in  America;  empower  the  research  and  development  community  to 
move  us  closer  to  breakthroughs  on  technologies  like  batteries  for 
full  electric  vehicles,  as  well  as  for  plug-in  hybrids  and  fuel  cells. 
We  need  to  motivate  consumers  to  conserve  fuel  and  to  consider 
purchasing one of the many fuel-efficient autos on sale today. 

Today,  Mr.  Chairman,  there  is  a  clear  choice  before  the  Com-
mittee.  Policymakers  can  continue  to  look  backwards,  reworking  a 
1970’s  program  that  was  created  in  a  very  different  world,  or  pol-
icymakers  can  move  forward,  focusing  on  broader  climate  change 
issues in a rapidly changing world.

Increasing  fuel  economy  and  reducing  carbon  dioxide  emissions 
is a shared responsibility that must include vehicle miles traveled, 
fuel  substitution,  and  vehicle  technology.  Attempts  to  address  con-
cerns  about  energy  security  and  carbon  dioxide  emissions  cannot 
succeed by focusing only on one component of gasoline demand. An 
economywide approach is needed. A market-driven, market-respon-
sive  approach  is  needed.  Any  effective  program  needs  to  consider 
the realities of the marketplace. 

And  finally,  Mr.  Chairman,  an  effective  approach  needs  to  be 
comprehensive  and  nationwide.  The  United  States  needs  a  con-
sistent  national  policy  that  avoids  the  marketplace  chaos  that 
would  surely  arise  from  a  patchwork  of  conflicting  State  fuel  econ-
omy and carbon dioxide mandates. 

Once  again,  autos  are  only  one  part  of  the  energy  security  pic-
ture.  Broader-based  policies  in  addressing  fuels,  and  the  use  of 
those fuels by consumers, need to be explored, as well. 

And,  Mr.  Chairman,  we  look  forward  to  working  with  you  and 

the Committee, and I’d be glad to take questions. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. McCurdy follows:] 

STATEMENT OF DAVE MCCURDY, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS 

Mr. Chairman, 
Good  afternoon,  my  name  is  Dave  McCurdy  and  I  am  the  President  and  CEO  of 
the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. The Alliance is the auto industry’s lead-
ing 
including  BMW, 
DaimlerChrysler,  Ford  Motor  Company,  General  Motors,  Mazda,  Mitsubishi, 
Porsche, Toyota and Volkswagen. 

representing  nine  manufacturers 

trade  association 

On  behalf  of  our  members  I’d  like  to  thank  you  for  giving  me  an  opportunity  to 
be  here  today  to  share  with  you  both  the  industry’s  progress  in,  and  future  chal-
lenges to, increasing fleet fuel economy. Alliance members share the concerns of our 
customers,  the  Congress  and  the  American  public  about  fuel  economy  and  carbon 
dioxide emissions. 

As  an  introduction,  it  is  the  view  of  the  Alliance  of  Automobile  Manufacturers 
that enhancing energy security and reducing carbon dioxide emissions are priorities 
to  all  Americans,  and  the  auto  industry  must  continue  to  aggressively  pursue  its 
innovation  agenda.  At  a  March  14,  House  Energy  and  Commerce  Committee  hear-
ing, CEOs from DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors and Toyota 
all  committed  to  working  with  Congress  to  find  new  ways  to  address  the  issues  of 
climate  change  and  fuel  economy.  I  am  here  today  to  share  that  message  with  this 
Committee. 

Because  the  only  feasible  way  to  reduce  the  amount  of  current  carbon-based  fuel 
from automobiles is to reduce the amount of fuel a vehicle uses, auto engineers are 
working  hard  to  include  a  diverse  range  of  highly  fuel-efficient  technologies  in  new 
vehicles. Today, every model is available with some kind of fuel-efficient technology, 
including direct fuel injection, four cylinder engines, variable valve timing, continu-
ously variable transmissions, cylinder deactivation and more. 

Automakers  are  investing  significantly  in  advanced  technology  vehicles  powered 
by electricity, biofuels, diesel, hydrogen and compressed natural gas. Still, autos are 
only  one  part  of  the  energy  security  picture.  Through  the  Corporate  Average  Fuel 
Economy  (CAFE)  program,  we  are  already  a  ‘‘carbon-constrained’’  industry  and  one 
that is heavily regulated. 

Manufacturers  believe  that  the  best  way  to  enhance  energy  security  and  reduce 
carbon  dioxide  emissions  is  through  the  use  of  alternative  fuels  including  E85  and 
flexible fuel vehicles. Today, 10.5 million alternative fuel autos that operate with hy-
brid  technology  or  run  on  fuels  like  clean  diesel,  ethanol,  hydrogen  and  others  are 
already on the road, and Alliance members are offering more for sale this year. Ad-
ditionally,  there  are  60  models  of  alternative  fuel  vehicles  on  sale  today,  up  from 
12 in 2000 and many more models are planned for future production. 

Since  the  1970s,  new  vehicles  have  continued  to  become  more  fuel-efficient.  EPA 
data demonstrates that fuel efficiency has increased steadily at 1–2 percent per year 
on  average  from  1975  for  both  cars  and  light  trucks.  Passenger  car  fuel  economy

has more than doubled from 14.2 mpg in 1974 to 29.8 mpg in 2006 and light truck 
fuel economy has increased by 60 percent since 1974. But as we have noted on many 
previous  occasions,  the  ultimate  decisions  about  what  vehicles  are  purchased  and 
how they are driven belong to American consumers. 

And  while  consumers  value  fuel  economy,  they  also  want  many  other  attributes 
in  today’s  vehicles,  such  as  safety,  passenger  and  cargo  room,  performance,  towing 
and  hauling  capacity.  Our  challenge  is  to  develop  vehicles  that  combine  these  at-
tributes with improved fuel efficiency . . . and an affordable price. 

The auto industry leads the way when it comes to investing in research and devel-
opment. Automakers are committed to being first to market with breakthrough tech-
nologies that can produce new generations of autos with advanced powertrains and 
fuels.  Automakers  are  competing  to  bring  these  vehicles  to  market,  as  soon  as  the 
technology is feasible, affordable and meets consumer expectations. 

The  U.S.  cannot  achieve  energy  security  through  CAFE  alone.  CAFE  is  a  one-di-
mensional  and  incomplete  program.  Any  transportation  energy  policy  must  be  com-
prehensive  and  multi-dimensional  to  be  effective,  and  we  believe  that  all  sectors  of 
the  economy,  not  just  transportation  and  certainly  not  just  automakers,  should 
strive to reduce petroleum consumption. 

The  Alliance  believes  Congress  should  look  beyond  CAFE  and  should  consider  a 
multi-sector, integrated transportation energy policy that motivates all stakeholders 
to  make  decisions  consistent  with  the  shared  goal  of  reducing  petroleum  imports. 
An effective transportation energy policy needs to: 

fuels; 

ture in America; 

• Foster  more  alternative  fuel  choices,  especially  more  low-carbon,  renewable 
• Implement  an  aggressive  program  to  enhance  the  alternative  fuels  infrastruc-
• Empower the research and development community to move us closer to break-
throughs  on  technologies  like  batteries  for  full  electric  vehicles,  as  well  as  for 
plug-in hybrids and fuel cells; 
• Encourage  the  U.S.  investment  community  to  stimulate  economic  investments 
in our future fuels and technologies; 
• Involve all levels of government; and 
• Motivate  consumers  to  conserve  fuel  and  to  consider  purchasing  one  of  the 

many fuel-efficient autos on sale today. 

Corporate Average Fuel Economy 

The  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy  (CAFE)  program  was  established  by  Con-
gress in 1975 to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil by reducing overall fuel con-
sumption.  The  Energy  Policy  and  Conservation  Act  directed  the  National  Highway 
Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA)  to  set  national  fuel  economy  standards  at 
the ‘‘maximum feasible’’ level taking into account key elements such as technological 
feasibility,  affordability,  safety,  emissions  controls,  consumer  choice,  disparate  im-
pacts on manufacturers and effects on American jobs. 

For Model Year (MY) 2008, each automaker’s fleet must average 27.5 mpg for cars 
and  22.5  mpg  for  light  trucks  (pickups,  vans,  minivans  and  sport  utility  vehicles). 
For  light  trucks,  NHTSA  recently  reformed  the  standard  setting  system  for  light 
trucks. Automakers are currently in the fourth year of seven straight years of light 
truck  CAFE  increases,  which  started  in  MY  2005  and  proceeds  through  MY  2011. 
When  reforming  light  truck  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy  (CAFE)  standards, 
NHTSA used an attribute-based approach that acknowledged consumers require dif-
ferent  sized  vehicles  for  their  business  and  family  needs.  NHTSA’s  attribute-based 
approach  addressed  some  of  the  previous  concerns  about  safety  and  about  inequi-
table  effects  on  different  manufacturers  arising  from  the  previous  ‘‘one  size  fits  all’’ 
standards. 

The  Alliance  supports  NHTSA’s  obtaining  the  authority  to  reform  the  CAFE 
standard  for  cars  into  an  attribute-based  system,  but  NHTSA  should  not  prejudge 
the issue by assuming that the footprint-based system used in the light truck reform 
rulemaking  makes  the  most  sense  for  cars.  The  Alliance  supports  a  rulemaking 
process  that  maximizes  consumer  choice,  avoids  safety  concerns,  and  allocates  the 
burdens  of  the  CAFE  program  equitably  among  manufacturers,  without  injuring 
competition  or  any  individual  automaker.  Attribute-based  approaches,  when  prop-
erly  designed,  can  help  achieve  these  objectives,  but  ultimately,  success  in  meeting 
these  objectives  depends  on  the  provisions  of  the  program,  such  as  the  specific  at-
tributes  or  set  of  attributes  that  are  chosen,  the  level  at  which  standards  are  set, 
and the adequate provision of lead-time. Whatever attributes are considered for cars 
must preserve the diverse types of passenger cars.

CAFE, Consumers and Gasoline Use 

58 

While the CAFE program targets the fuel economy of the new vehicles that auto-
makers produce, other factors have dramatically increased gasoline use in the light 
duty fleet. Relatively low fuel costs (compared to the rest of the world) coupled with 
increasingly fuel-efficient autos have resulted in consumers driving more miles. The 
Department  of  Transportation  documents  that  ‘‘vehicle  miles  traveled’’  (VMT)  has 
increased  40  percent  during  the  timeframe  CAFE  has  been  in  effect,  from  10,000 
miles per licensed driver in 1977 to almost 14,000 miles per licensed driver in 2001. 
Analysts  predict  that,  as  auto  fuel  efficiency  continues  to  improve,  VMT  will  con-
tinue to increase. 

Higher  CAFE  standards  would  have  no  near  term  impact  on  gasoline  use.  First, 
increases  in  the  size  of  the  overall  vehicle  fleet  and  the  number  of  vehicle  miles 
traveled each year are far greater influencers of U.S. oil consumption—and gasoline 
prices—than  CAFE  requirements.  (Even  though  the  fuel  economy  of  the  light  duty 
fleets  of  vehicles  has  increased  dramatically  since  the  1970s,  U.S.  demand  for  oil 
has  not  declined  and  imports  have  increased  substantially.)  Second,  with  over  230 
million vehicles on the road and only 17 million new vehicles sold each year, it takes 
15–20 years for higher fuel economy vehicles to displace the ones on the road today. 
Automaker  product  decisions  alone  cannot  guarantee  compliance  with  CAFE 
standards.  Because  CAFE  is  based  on  the  mix  of  vehicles  sold  each  year,  whether 
a  manufacturer  meets  the  CAFE  standard  or  not  depends  both  on  what  products 
are  offered,  and  on  what  products  consumers  purchase.  While  the  law  holds  manu-
facturers  responsible  for  meeting  CAFE  standards,  in  reality  consumer  purchases 
play  a  huge  role  in  determining  whether  a  manufacturer  meets,  exceeds  or  falls 
short of the standard in any given year. 

When  considering  what  kind  of  vehicle  to  buy,  consumers  evaluate  all  the  dif-
ferent uses they will demand of their new car or light truck. Most consumers select 
vehicles  that  best  serve  their  peak  uses,  whether  carrying  kids,  carpooling  adults, 
towing  trailers,  hauling  supplies,  accommodating  handicapped,  handling  adverse 
terrain  and  weather,  addressing  recreational  needs  and/or  meeting  job/business  de-
mands—even if these attributes may be used infrequently. 

Automakers  share  the  goal  of  increasing  fuel  efficiency  as  they  develop  vehicles 
that meet the various needs of American families and are committed to offering fuel 
efficient  vehicles  in  every  segment.  According  to  www.fueleconomy.gov,  automakers 
offer  close  to  200  models  that  have  EPA-estimated  highway  ratings  of  30  miles  per 
gallon or more. However, each year since 2001 American consumers have purchased 
more light trucks than passenger cars. In 2006, for the fifth year in a row, pickups, 
minivans,  vans  and  SUVs  outsold  passenger  cars.  More  than  53  percent  of  all  new 
vehicles purchased last year were light trucks. 

By failing to take into account the cost of fuel and consumer buying habits, CAFE 
addresses  only  one  component  of  the  fuel  economy  equation.  Consumers  value  fuel 
economy, but they typically value even more the other attributes of the vehicles they 
purchase.  As  a  result,  when  CAFE  pushes  automakers  to  add  technology  or  reduce 
size/weight  of  vehicles,  the  additional  costs  involved  and  the  tradeoffs  of  other  at-
tributes  may  not  be  embraced  by  consumers.  These  vehicle  decisions  can  have  dra-
matic and adverse competitive implications among automakers. 
Proposed CAFE Legislation 

Regarding S. 357, as well as S. 183, S. 1118, and S. 767, the most important mes-

sage of Alliance members is very clear: 

We  support  improving  fuel  efficiency  to  the  maximum  feasible  level.  Improving 
fuel  economy  is  a  consumer  issue,  an  economic  issue,  a  climate  change  issue, 
an energy security issue, and a priority. 

The Alliance opposes legislation that is not technologically feasible, because of the 
proposed  arbitrary  CAFE  target  and/or  the  proposed  arbitrary  lead  time.  The  Alli-
ance also opposes CAFE targets that are not based on a balance of objective criteria. 
When setting ‘‘maximum feasible’’ fuel economy standards for the Nation, Congress 
required  NHTSA  to  gather  extensive  data  on  technological  feasibility,  affordability, 
safety, emissions, consumer choice and effects on American jobs. This approach bal-
ances the many trade-offs and consequences, and it remains a solid policy approach. 
We  oppose  the  provision  in  S.  357  that  would  combine  car  and  light  truck  CAFE 
standards. Starting with the 2010 model year, the overall car/truck fleet would face 
an increase in CAFE requirements of over 40 percent by 2019. Based on today’s 50/ 
50  split  between  cars  and  light  trucks,  achieving  this  level  would  require  the  car 
fleet to reach nearly 40 mpg and the light truck fleet to reach nearly 32 mpg. These 
are  essentially  the  same  levels  of  increase  that  have  been  proposed  legislatively  in

the  last  three  energy  bill  debates  and  soundly  defeated  in  both  the  House  and  the 
Senate. 

Existing  Federal  law  rightfully  separates  cars  and  light  trucks  in  the  CAFE  pro-
gram  by  setting  differing  fuel  economy  standards  for  each.  Cars  and  light  trucks 
have distinct characteristics, so the two programs should not be combined into a sin-
gle standard, as these characteristics are essential and need to be preserved for con-
sumers  who  value  different  attributes  in  their  vehicles.  Combining  car  and  light 
truck standards would raise the costs of many popular utility and work-related vehi-
cles, hurting small businesses, trades people, farmers and others who are dependent 
on light duty trucks for their livelihoods. However, automakers support both the car 
and  light  truck  programs  being  based  on  attribute-based  systems,  though  the  at-
tributes may differ since cars and light trucks have different characteristics. 
Alternative Fuel Autos 

Alliance  members  support  enhancing  energy  security,  promoting  fuel  diversity 
and  increasing  fuel  efficiency  through  accelerating  the  availability  of  the  growing 
number of advanced technology and alternative fuel automobiles in the market. Al-
ternative fuel autos, including vehicles that run on hybrid-electric technology, clean 
diesel,  and  alternative  fuels  like  E85  ethanol  and  hydrogen,  will  help  our  country 
address the growing concerns about U.S. gasoline consumption and oil imports. 

Federal  and  state  incentives  for  consumers  who  purchase  alternative  fuel  auto-
mobiles can accelerate the introduction of these highly fuel-efficient vehicles. Work-
ing together, we believe that government and industry can put more alternative fuel 
automobiles on our roadways. 

An  important  provision  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  (EPAcT  2005)  is  the  in-
creased  promotion  of  renewable  fuels  in  the  transportation  sector.  Since  1996,  auto 
manufacturers  have  been  producing  vehicles  capable  of  using  high  concentration 
blends of ethanol, including E85. Currently there are more than five million of these 
E85  capable  vehicles  on  the  road  with  nearly  one  million  more  being  added  each 
year. 

And while EPAcT 2005 will help in E85 infrastructure development by raising the 
requirement  for  the  use  of  ethanol  and  other  renewable  fuels  to  7.5  billion  gallons 
per  year  by  2012  and  providing  tax  incentives  aimed  at  making  more  E85  pumps 
available to the driving public and helping to reduce reliance on oil imports, we still 
have a long way to go before widespread availability of E85 is achieved. Of the more 
than  170,000  fueling  stations  nationwide,  roughly  1,200  currently  offer  E85  to  con-
sumers. 

Hybrid-electric vehicles are on sale today and already saving fuel. The number of 
these vehicles will increase substantially over the next years. They offer significant 
improvements in fuel economy, up to 50 percent, and reduced emissions. These vehi-
cles use electric motors for propulsion and to reduce some burdens on the traditional 
internal  combustion  engine,  and  they  capture  usable  energy  through  regenerative 
braking.  By  2010,  more  than  50  hybrid  nameplates  are  expected  to  be  available  in 
North  America,  with  volumes  approaching  one  million  vehicles.  Hybrid  technology 
can also be applied to diesels, alternative fuel and fuel cell vehicles. 

Vehicles that are powered by clean diesel technology, such as direct injection die-
sels,  offer  greater  fuel  economy  and  better  performance  than  conventional  gasoline- 
powered engines. In Europe more than 50 percent of all new vehicles purchased are 
diesel vehicles, compared to less than 1 percent in the U.S. Diesel-powered vehicles 
are  popular  in  Europe  for  several  reasons.  Economic  incentives  have  been  estab-
lished  to  enhance  their  appeal.  Because  of  higher  fuel  costs,  European  drivers  tend 
to  put  a  premium  on  fuel  economy.  In  the  European  Union,  tax  policies  drive  con-
sumers to highly value fuel economy. The EU taxes gasoline at $4.02/gallon and die-
sel  at  $3.04,  which  incentivizes  diesel.  In  contrast,  the  U.S.  taxes  gasoline  at  $.38 
per gallon and diesel at $.45 per gallon. 

The  EU  also  prioritizes  fuel  economy  over  nitrogen  oxides  (NOX)  emission  stand-
ards.  For  instance,  NOX standards  for  diesel  in  the  light-duty  fleet  are  more  than 
seven  times  higher  in  the  EU  than  in  the  U.S.  Achievement  of  U.S.-level  NOX 
standards  would  require  expensive  after-treatment,  raising  the  costs  of  diesel  vehi-
cles, eroding the fuel-economy benefits, and reducing consumer demand. 

Recently,  ultra-low  sulfur  diesel  fuel  (ULSD)  that  is  97  percent  cleaner  went  on 
sale  in  the  U.S.  This  new  diesel  fuel  opens  the  door  for  a  new  generation  of  highly 
fuel-efficient diesel vehicles to be sold in the U.S. that will run dramatically cleaner 
than their predecessors. 

These types of vehicles could provide fuel economy gains of up to 30 percent com-
pared  to  conventional  vehicles.  In  addition,  most  diesels  are  capable  of  running  on 
good  quality  biodiesel  blends  of  up  to  5  percent  (B5)  and  many  are  designed  to  use 
up  to  20  percent  or  100  percent  biodiesel  fuel  (B20  or  B100).  If  all  diesel  vehicles 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:03 Mar 21, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80033.TXT JACKIE

60 

on  the  road  today  were  fueled  with  B5  (5  percent  biodiesel)  we  could  displace  1.85 
billion gallons of petroleum per year; and 7.4 billion gallons per year if B20 (20 per-
cent biodiesel) were utilized. 

Several  manufacturers  have  also  announced  progress  toward  the  introduction  of 
plug-in hybrid vehicles. Once batteries become available in affordable power trains, 
these  products  may  be  of  interest  to  consumers.  Plug-in  hybrid-electric  vehicles, 
which  are  hybrid  cars  with  a  larger  capacity  battery,  look  and  perform  much  like 
‘‘regular’’ cars but they can be plugged into a 110-volt outlet (for instance each night 
at home, or during the workday at a parking garage) and charged. Plug-in vehicles 
can  reduce  oil  consumption  and  rely  on  domestically  produced  energy  for  a  greater 
portion of their operation. Once the range of the battery is exceeded, the vehicle will 
automatically  switch  to  a  conventional  internal  combustion  engine.  Manufacturers 
are  still  working  on  several  significant  issues,  including  size,  lifetime  cost  and 
recyclability of the battery, but we remain optimistic. 

From  a  vehicle  perspective,  hydrogen-powered  fuel  cells  offer  the  greatest  poten-
tial  improvement  in  fuel  efficiency  and  emissions  reductions.  They  also  create  a 
great  opportunity  for  eliminating  dependency  on  petroleum.  However,  widespread 
commercialization  of  this  technology  and  establishment  of  the  hydrogen  infrastruc-
ture are some years away. 

Another promising and enabling technology is hydrogen-powered internal combus-
tion  engines  (ICEs).  The  concept  of  using  hydrogen  ICEs  offers  several  advantages: 
near-zero  emissions,  maintaining  the  utility,  flexibility,  and  driving  dynamic  of  to-
day’s  automobile,  assisting  in  the  development  of  hydrogen  storage  technology,  and 
developing  hydrogen  distribution  channels  and  helping  to  promote  hydrogen  refuel-
ing infrastructure. 

While fuel-efficient technologies are on sale today, more technology is being devel-
oped  for  possible  future  introduction.  Thousands  of  automotive  engineers  are  work-
ing on innovative technologies every day, but many promising technologies, such as 
plug-in hybrids and fuel cells, still need significant research and development before 
they will be commercially ready. 
Conclusion 

Today, there is a clear choice before the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation  Committee.  Policymakers  can  continue  to  look  backward,  reworking  a  1970s 
program that was created in a very different world. Or, policymakers can move for-
ward, focusing on broader climate change issues in a rapidly changing world. 

In  March,  the  auto  industry  testified  before  the  House  Energy  and  Commerce 
Committee to consider the creation of a broad, multi-sector cap and trade approach 
to  regulating  carbon  dioxide.  While  the  Senate  Commerce,  Science,  and  Transpor-
tation  Committee  is  focusing  on  CAFE,  we  encourage  the  Senate  to  consider  autos 
in  the  context  of  a  broader  carbon  dioxide  program.  There  are  strong  reasons  to  do 
so. 

CAFE alone does not address consumer preferences. In the U.S., 70 percent of the 
new vehicles purchased by consumers have a 6-cylinder or 8-cylinder engine. In the 
European  Union,  fleet  fuel  economy  is  about  35  mpg,  or  the  goal  of  S.  357.  But  in 
Europe, 89 percent of new automobiles are sold with a 4-cylinder or smaller engine. 
In  the  U.S.,  92  percent  of  new  autos  are  sold  with  automatic  transmissions,  com-
pared to 20 percent in Europe. 

Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) will continue to increase in the United States. VMT 
is a result of population growth and affluence, two factors that policymakers should 
never  seek  to  restrict.  In  fact,  as  autos  become  more  fuel-efficient,  consumers  tend 
to  drive  more,  which  ultimately  has  the  opposite  effect  of  increasing  gasoline  use. 
CAFE has no effect on the price of gasoline, so a broader approach is needed. 

The  carbon  burden  needs  to  be  shared.  Reducing  carbon  is  dependent  on  three 
intertwined factors: VMT (which includes consumers), fuels substitution, and vehicle 
technology.  Attempts  to  address  concerns  about  energy  security  and  carbon  dioxide 
emissions  cannot  succeed  by  focusing  only  on  one  component  of  gasoline  demand. 
Vehicle  fuel  economy  will  continue  to  increase  as  new  and  improved  technologies 
find their way into the market, but vehicle technology alone will not slow the grow-
ing demand for gasoline in the U.S. transportation sector. 

Clearly, an integrated approach is needed. In 1999, President Clinton signed into 
law EPA’s landmark regulations called Tier 2. These regulations are noteworthy be-
cause for the first time, autos and fuels were regulated as a system. Our clean autos 
needed clean fuels, and the higher sulfur fuel sold in the 1990s would have disabled 
our new clean vehicle technology. As Congress considers the broader climate change 
issue,  one  important  goal  is  to  consider  fuels  and  autos  together.  Automakers  need 
to invest to accommodate alternative fuels, and energy providers need certainty that 
more alternative fuel autos will be on U.S. roads.

An  economy-wide  approach  is  needed.  The  costs  of  reducing  a  ton  of  carbon  diox-
ide are not the same in every sector. For autos, the costs of reducing carbon dioxide 
are extremely high compared to other sectors. The most effective way to reduce car-
bon,  as  well  as  the  most  cost-effective  way,  may  be  through  an  economy-wide  cap 
and trade program. 

An economy-sensitive approach is needed. Many segments of our economy depend 
on cars and light trucks. Farmers, tradesmen, small businesses and others need ve-
hicles, especially larger cars and light trucks, for their livelihoods. Any program that 
reduces the availability of these work vehicles or significantly raises their costs rep-
resents a burden on the U.S. economy, and especially a burden on independent and 
small businesses. 

A  market-driven,  market-responsive  approach  is  needed.  Any  effective  program 
needs  to  consider  the  realities  of  the  marketplace.  CAFE  can  create  distortions  in 
the  market,  depending  on  the  price  of  gasoline.  By  contrast,  incentives  in  place  for 
the  renewable  fuels  program  enable  competitive  pricing  of  ethanol,  which  is  result-
ing in increased consumer demand for this alternative fuel. 

Incentives  are  needed  to  encourage  real  reductions  in  carbon  dioxide.  Incentives 
can  encourage  consumers  to  purchase  the  many  advanced  technology  autos  on  sale 
today.  Incentives  can  encourage  energy  providers  to  increase  availability  of  alter-
native  fuels.  And  incentives  can  reward  automakers  for  high  achievement  in  devel-
oping  new  technologies  and  producing  more  alternative  fuel  autos.  CAFE,  by  con-
trast, has few incentives and fails to bring consumers into the equation. 

Any effective, broader program to reduce carbon dioxide needs to allow for compa-
nies  to  grow  and  thrive,  without  imposing  provisions  that  would  result  in  job  loss. 
The  ultimate  goal  is  real  reductions  in  tons  of  carbon  dioxide,  not  wealth  transfer 
among companies or higher cost autos. 

Fuel economy/carbon dioxide targets are important as part of a reformed, broader- 
based  economy-wide  program,  but  lead  time  is  critical.  Some  climate  change  pro-
gram  proposals  incorporate  a  ‘‘step-down’’  approach,  which  includes  reductions  over 
a specified period of years, such as every 5 years. This approach provides more cer-
tainty  to  manufacturers,  and  a  step-down  approach  enables  an  industry  such  as 
auto  manufacturing  that  requires  5  years  to  develop  and  introduce  a  new  model, 
and 7 years to make significant changes to power trains. 

Finally,  any  effective  approach  needs  to  be  comprehensive  and  nationwide.  The 
United  States  needs  a  consistent  national  policy  that  avoids  the  marketplace  chaos 
that  would  surely  arise  from  a  patchwork  of  conflicting  state  fuel  economy/carbon 
dioxide mandates. 

Once  again,  autos  are  only  one  part  of  the  energy  security  picture.  For  30  years 
we  have  been  a  ‘‘carbon-constrained’’  industry.  Broader  based  policies  addressing 
fuels  and  the  use  of  those  fuels  by  consumers  need  to  be  explored  as  well.  To  be 
effective,  these  policies  must  incorporate  all  stakeholders,  including  alternative  en-
ergy  suppliers,  the  R&D  community,  the  investment  community,  government  at  all 
levels,  and  especially  consumers.  To  be  successful,  the  goal  of  reducing  petroleum 
consumption and carbon dioxide must be viewed as a shared responsibility. 

I  thank  the  Committee  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  testify  and  welcome  any 
questions you may have regarding the Alliance positions on improving fuel economy 
and reducing carbon dioxide. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Stanton. 
To demonstrate our interest in this issue, and because of the im-
portance  of  this  issue,  I’m  certain  you’ve  noted  that  we  have  not 
imposed any time limitation on speaking, and nor did I impose any 
limitation  on  Senators  to  speak.  And  I  can  assure  you  that  this 
Committee  will  do  its  absolute  best  to  try  to  come  up  with  some-
thing workable. 

Senator Stevens? 
Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  thank  you  very  much,  Chairman.  I  con-
gratulate  you.  I  do,  too,  agree  with  your  concept  of  letting  all  the 
witnesses  speak  fully  on  the  statements.  And  I’m  sorry  to  say  I 
have to go now, but I do want to thank Admiral Blair and Admiral 
McGinn  for  bringing  in  the  security  issue.  I  hope  the  Senate  and 
the  Committee  listened  to  you,  because  the  security  issue  is  the 
turning  point  on  this,  as  far  as  I’m  concerned.  And  I  think  if  we 
listen to you, we will get a bill that will make some sense.

I do thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank you, sir. 
Senator Kerry? 
Senator KERRY. Mr. Chairman, thank you. 
Thank you, all, on the panel. 
Picking up on what Senator Stevens just said about the security 
issue,  Admiral  McGinn,  I  heard  you  use  the  reference  to  the  10- 
year  window  here.  And  I  think  that’s  a  really  important  frame-
work. In my judgment, there’s a threshold that you’ve got to begin 
to, sort of, look at this whole picture through, if you will. And that 
is,  sort  of,  what’s  driving  this.  Really,  we’re  back  here  having  this 
discussion,  not  because  the,  the  automatics  of  20  years  of  delay 
have suddenly expired or run their course, it’s because a whole new 
set  of  compelling  facts  are  staring  us  in  the  face.  And  the  bottom 
line of those facts is, essentially, if you accept Jim Hansen’s notion, 
and  the  scientific  consensus,  there’s  a  10-year  window  here.  We 
have  a  10-year  window  within  which  to  deal  with  the  climate 
change  issue  appropriately.  Now,  that’s  if  you  accept  the  science. 
I  do.  And  I  accept  it,  because  the  feedback  that  we’re  getting  from 
the  predictions  made  by  all  of  those  scientists,  2,000-plus  strong 
from 130 countries, is coming back at a greater rate and in greater 
amount than they had predicted. So, their alarm bells are ringing. 
Given that, and recognizing that we need a 10-year concept here, 
then if you also accept that you need an economywide cap, because 
the  economywide  cap  is  the  only  way  you’re  going  to  begin  to  get 
at all the pieces of this sufficiently to get somewhere between a 65 
to 80 percent reduction by 2050—and I assume it’s the 80 percent, 
frankly, because of the rate that things are coming back—therefore, 
everything’s got to be part of it, and that includes automobiles. 

One  gallon  of  gasoline,  I  believe,  is  about  22  pounds  of  CO2.  So, 
every gallon of gasoline that you don’t use because you’re not driv-
ing  or  you  have  a  more  efficient  car,  you’re  beginning  to  reduce 
your CO2. So, that’s one reason to compel. 

The  other  is  obviously  the  security  issue  about  who  we  depend 
on  for  our  fuel,  and  what  we’re  relying  on,  and  how  independent 
America is with respect to that. 

So, let me ask you, based on that, are we able to believe that the 
35  miles  per  gallon  standard  that  they  want  to  set,  fleetwide—let 
me  just  say  parenthetically  here,  I  accept  Senator  Levin’s  argu-
ment.  Senator  Levin  and  I  met  yesterday.  I’ve  talked  to  him  over 
several  years  on  this  argument.  And  we  had  a  runaround  on  this 
when  Senator  McCain  and  I  were  the  leaders  on  the  CAFE  effort 
a  number  of  years  ago  on  the  floor.  And  I  believe  there  is  a  legiti-
mate  argument,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  we  do  have  to  take  into  ac-
count,  about  the  discrimination.  It  doesn’t  make  sense  that  a  for-
eign  manufacturer  can  come  in  here  and  sell  a  light  truck  to  a 
greater  degree,  which  gets  the  same  mileage,  or  worse,  than  an 
American  truck,  but  they  can  do  it,  because  the  corporate  average 
says  you’ve  got  a  whole—your  fleet  has  a  whole  bunch  less—you 
know,  you’ve  got  a  lot  more  small  cars,  a  lot  less  trucks,  so  go 
ahead and sell the trucks, and you make up the difference, because 
we’re  going  to  measure  the  whole  average.  It  doesn’t  make  sense 
anymore. I believe we ought to have a nondiscriminatory attribute- 
based system of some kind or another.

But  the  question,  to  come  back,  is:  Is  it  adequate,  is  it  respon-
sible, within the framework of what you’re saying, to have 35? Sen-
ator  Stabenow  and  Senator  Levin  said  that,  ‘‘We  think  maybe  we 
ought to be pushing the’’—what was the term they used? I think— 
‘‘leap-ahead  technology  and  large  technology  and  so  forth’’—well, 
one  of  those  leap-ahead  technologies  is  obviously  a  plug-in  hybrid, 
which  I  talked  about  earlier.  I  mean,  if  you’ve  got  people  who  can 
drive around and get 150 miles per gallon today, why can’t we leap 
ahead  and  have  a  whole  bunch  more  of  those  vehicles  available  to 
Americans,  which  doesn’t  require  them  to  give  up  size,  to  give  up 
ability  to  take  the  kids  to  the  soccer  game,  to  do  all  the  things 
we’ve  heard  about  in  these  arguments  for  years,  but  could  do  it  at 
much  less  cost  and  greater  efficiency?  And  we  could  provide  a 
$3,000  or  $4,000  tax  credit,  which  I,  incidentally,  proposed  3–4 
years ago, that would cover the entire cost for the consumer. 

So,  should  we  be  thinking  of  a  larger  concept  than  35?  And,  do 
we  get  enough  of  what  we’re  trying  to  grab  out  of  the  standard 
we’re  talking  about  here?  And,  the  third  part  of  the  question  is, 
why  won’t  it  do  the  things  that  Alan  Reuther  has  said  it’ll  do  to 
the industry, in your judgment? 

Admiral MCGINN. Thank you, Senator Kerry. 
In  my  view,  CAFE  is  not—it’s  necessary,  but  not  sufficient.  It’s 

a good start. We have to start in a lot of areas. 

In  terms  of  breakthrough  technologies,  certainly  plug-in  hybrids 
are  a  key  part.  I  believe  Mr.  Reuther  mentioned  that  in  his  testi-
mony,  that  the  idea  of  bringing  some  of  the  key  components  that 
would  go  into  plug-in  hybrids  to  be  built  here  so  for  example  we 
can manufacture longer-lasting, higher-capacity batteries to extend 
the  vehicle  miles  on  a  daily  basis  of  plug-in  hybrids,  reducing  the 
requirement  to  burn  any  type  of  liquid  fuel,  whether  it’s  gasoline 
or, more importantly and more likely in the future, bio-based fuels. 
I  think  there’s  a  lot  that  can  be  done  in  this  country,  in  terms  of 
the entire choice of fuels. This needs to be done beyond gasoline or 
hydrocarbons, in carbohydrate-based fuels, in a way that isn’t sim-
ply,  ‘‘Let’s  make  ethanol  from  corn,’’  but,  rather,  ‘‘Let’s  make  eth-
anol  from  prairie  grass,  switchgrass,  biomass  from  farms.’’  And,  I 
think,  also  there’s  a  great  place  for  newer,  high-efficiency  diesels. 
In a plug-in hybrid, the internal combustion engine can be literally 
anything.  It  can  be  gasoline-powered,  diesel-powered,  the  fuel  that 
goes into it can be a whole variety of bio-based or hydrocarbon. 

Senator KERRY. That’s—sorry. 
Admiral  MCGINN.  But  I  think  that  we  need  to  recognize  that 
these  technologies  are  available  now,  they  can  be  improved  by 
American manufacture—— 

Senator KERRY. Let me stop you there, just for a minute. If they 
are available now, then what’s going to get them out there into the 
marketplace faster? I met with one of the—— 

Admiral MCGINN. Right. 
Senator  KERRY.—Big  Three  CEOs  a  few  years  ago,  and  I  sat 
there  and  asked  that  question  several  years  ago,  and  I  won’t  say 
who  it  was,  but  you  know  what  the  answer  was  from  the  CEO  of 
one  of  the  Big  Three?  ‘‘Well,  the  American  consumer  isn’t  asking 
for it.’’ 

Admiral MCGINN. Yes.

Senator  KERRY.  So,  we’ve  lost  those  3  years,  essentially.  You 
want  to  answer  that,  Mr.  McCurdy,  you  can.  I  don’t  want  to—let 
the Admiral—— 

Admiral MCGINN. I would just—— 
Mr. MCCURDY. Let the Admiral finish. I want to—— 
Admiral  MCGINN.  I  would  just  say  that  incentives,  as  you’ve 
pointed  out,  Senator,  are  certainly  a  way  to  help  stimulate  that 
market.  There  are  external  forces  that  you  also  mentioned  that 
are—and I have really focused on in my testimony—that are really 
going  to  influence  the  market.  People  understand  about  high  gas 
prices.  They  really  got  a  dose  of  it—we  got  a  dose  of  it—post- 
Katrina.  That  is  not  going  to  get  less  frequent  or  less  intense,  it’s 
going to get more frequent and more intense. And we live in a very, 
very  dangerous  world.  The  threat  of  terrorism,  the  threat  of  polit-
ical  embargoes  all  are  real,  and  the  American  people  understand 
that,  and  they  understand  what  it  can  do,  right  to  their  pocket-
book, on practically a daily basis as the prices go higher at the gas 
pump. 

The  other  point  I  would  make  is  that  as  a  result  of  the  science 
being more and more consistent, longer-term, things like the Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change reports series that is going 
now,  people  understand  that  climate  change  is  a  real  threat,  not 
just  in  an  abstract  sense,  but  in  a  very  personal  way  for  us  today, 
and,  in  particular,  when  we  think  about  our  children  and  grand-
children. 

Senator  KERRY.  The  one  part  you  didn’t  answer  is  to  Mr. 
Reuther’s testimony about this negative impact that it will have on 
the industry. 

Admiral MCGINN. I believe it’s an opportunity for the industry to 
seize  on  these  technologies,  the  ones  that  exist,  the  ones  that  are 
about ready to come into production, or could come into production, 
and really do the leap-ahead. 

CAFE will, or rather could be, looked at in retrospect as an arti-
fact  of  an  old  technology  marketplace.  If  we  really,  really  invest, 
the  way  that  Americans  can,  the  way  American  industry  can,  in 
the  right  kinds  of  automotive  technology,  CAFE  does  not  preclude 
great advances in fuel efficiency, it motivates them to be produced. 

Senator KERRY. Mr. McCurdy? 
Mr. MCCURDY. Thanks, Senator. 
Couple  of  quick  points.  You  asked  the  question  why  some  of  the 
technology  is  available.  And,  actually,  Admiral  McGinn,  in  his  for-
mal  statement,  quotes  a  person  whom  I  have  a  great  deal  of  re-
spect,  and,  having  an  Air  Force  background,  probably  lean  that 
way  a  little  bit  more—and  that’s  General  Chuck  Wald.  And  Gen-
eral  Wald,  who’s  part  of  the  group,  indicated  that  if  you  factor  in 
the cost of military security into gasoline, that the real price of gas-
oline  is  somewhere  between  $6.50  and  $7  a  gallon.  And,  as  a  mat-
ter  of  fact,  Senator  Lugar’s  Committee  last  year,  when  he  was 
Chair,  had  hearings  and  testimony  that  said  it  was  closer  to  $10. 
The  price  of  gasoline—equivalent—in  London  today  is  $6.17  a  gal-
lon. The reason that the European prices are high are because they 
have  energy  taxes.  Those  taxes  drive  consumer  behavior.  What’s 
available in Europe today, 53 percent of the vehicles in Europe are 
diesel. They’re clean diesel. It’s not the diesel that we used to think

about in the 1980’s, and, you know, in the United States. This tech-
nology  could  be  available.  Now,  it’s  having  to  be  certified  in  Cali-
fornia, but, you know, we’re getting to that point. 

But  the  fact  is,  the  important  factor—and  that’s  what  I  tried  to 
raise  earlier—it’s  one  thing  to  talk  about  vehicles,  it’s  another 
thing  to  talk  about  fuels,  which  have  to  go  hand-in-hand.  It’s  why 
you  have  to  have  a  comprehensive  approach.  But  if  you  leave  the 
consumer  out,  I  don’t  believe  the  market’s  going  to  work.  And  the 
market does have a real role to play. 

And  in  some  of  my  conversations  with  the  SAFE  group,  one  of 
the  concerns  I  have  is  that  they  do  not  argue—they  do  not  believe 
that  gas  tax  or  that  the  price  signals  are  sufficient  to  drive  that 
consumer  behavior.  However,  within  the  NHTSA  criteria,  they 
would like to have a cost factor added on the cost-effectiveness that 
would, in effect, add 50 percent to the price of a gallon of gasoline. 
So,  what  we  see  here  is  a  hidden  tax  that—I  think  it  should  be 
much  more  transparent,  and  that  the  consumer  know  what  these 
costs  are.  We’re  passing  on  the  cost  to  one  sector.  And  all  we’re 
asking  is—we’re  prepared  to  do  our  share.  We  had  the  four  CEOs 
testify.  They  support  real  movement  on  climate  change  and  caps. 
And other groups may say they—— 

Senator  KERRY.  But  are  you  suggesting  that  caps  alone  is— 

would—— 

Mr. MCCURDY. No. 
Senator KERRY. OK. 
Mr.  MCCURDY.  I  think  it  has  to  be  a  combination.  There  will  be 
a  performance  metric  for  automobiles  that  should  be  applied.  I 
don’t  think  it’s  the  old  CAFE,  but  it  could  be  a  CO2 equivalent 
grams  per  mile.  That  is  fair,  and  that  is  an  appropriate  way  to  do 
it. 

Senator  KERRY.  I  don’t  want  to  abuse  my  time  here,  Mr.  Chair-
man but I do have more questions. But I just—you know, again you 
come  back  to  the  10-year  framework,  and  you  come  back  to  the, 
sort  of,  leadership  issue  necessary,  both  on  national—security  in 
terms  of  global  climate  change  and  security  in  terms  of  supply  of 
fuel  and  dependency  on  the  Middle  East  and  elsewhere.  And,  inci-
dentally,  we’re  not—that’s  not—the  Middle  East  isn’t  the  number- 
one  supplier.  But  the  bottom  line  is  that  we  have  a  responsibility 
to  put  in  place  whatever  incentives  are  going  to  bring  about  that 
consumer behavior; not wait for the consumer, but we have to lead 
the  consumer.  And  that’s  what  I  think  has  been,  sadly,  absent 
somewhat  in  the  leadership  out  in—you  know,  with  respect  to  the 
designs and what they’ve been willing to embrace. 

Prius,  you  know,  and  Insight,  are  out  there  like  crazy.  They’re 

selling like mad. 

Go ahead. 
Mr.  MCCURDY.  Senator,  I  just  want  to  make  one  comment  here. 
For the last 3 months, there have been incentives on hybrids. I own 
a  hybrid.  And  they’re  great  technologies.  There  are  second  genera-
tions that will be occurring. But when I was Chairman of the Sub-
committees on Armed Services, and Science and Space, and the In-
telligence  Committee—and  these  gentlemen  know  it  well—one  of 
the biggest challenges the military faced and NASA faced is battery 
technology.  It’s  power  storage.  And  we  still  have  challenges  there.

Senator KERRY. I completely—— 
Mr. MCCURDY. That is—— 
Senator KERRY.—understand that. 
Mr.  MCCURDY.—where  government  can,  in  fact,  help  a  great 
deal. But the fact of the matter is that fuel-efficient vehicles today, 
even  at  $3  a  gallon,  are  not  selling—there  was  early  adoption,  but 
there  is  less  demand  today  for  that,  and  manufacturers  actually 
lose money on those sales. 

Senator  KERRY.  They  do,  today.  And  I  understand  that.  But  I 
don’t  think  they  have  to.  If  we  were  to  put  the  right  policies  in 
place, is the bottom line. And also, you know, it depends partly on 
what  you’re  marketing  to  people.  I  mean,  you  can  see  the  mar-
keting  differential  between  muscle  vehicles  and  big  power.  We’ve 
even  gone  up  in  power  nowadays.  We’re—you  know,  this  is—it’s  a 
question  of  where  your  priority  is  and  what  you  want  to  start  to 
go  out  and  tell—sort  of,  suggest  to  people  is  important.  And,  I 
might  add,  I  think,  from  a  leadership  perspective,  given  what  our 
troops  are  sacrificing  on  our  behalf,  it  wouldn’t  have  been  a  bad 
idea  to  ask  Americans  to  join  in  this  effort.  And  that  might  have 
begun to change behavior. 

So,  I  think  there  are  a  lot  of  options  that  were  available  to  us 
with  respect  to  that.  And  I  know,  from  personal  experience,  I  own 
several hybrids, one here in Washington, one up in Massachusetts. 
I  would  have  loved  to  have  been  able  to  buy  a  van.  I  have  a  van 
up there, because I have to run around the state with press in the 
car,  and  staff  in  the  car,  and  I  need  the  room.  I  couldn’t  find  the 
vehicle. 

So,  we’re  not  getting  the  kind  of  choice  that  we  ought  to  be  get-

ting. And I hope that that will change, rapidly. 

Mr. Reuther? 
Mr.  REUTHER.  Senator,  there  has  been  discussion  about  incen-
tives  to  encourage  quicker  penetration  of  the  advanced  vehicles. 
And  I  just  want  to  underscore,  if  all  you  do  is  have  enhanced  con-
sumer  incentives,  we’re  going  to  lose  all  the  jobs  associated  with 
producing  these  vehicles  and  the  key  components.  What  we  need 
is  to  have  a  manufacturer’s  incentive  that  says,  yes,  here’s  assist-
ance that’s going to make it cheaper, and so we get the vehicles in 
quicker, but we want to tie it to the work being done in this coun-
try, so we also keep the jobs. 

Senator  KERRY.  As  you  recall  very  well,  Alan,  because  you  and 
I  worked  together  closely  on  all  of  this,  my  proposal  in  2004  was 
to  put  $1  billion  on  the  table  immediately  for  the  retooling  for  the 
industry  to  assist  in  that,  and  $2  billion  directly  into  some  of  the 
clean technologies so we could accelerate this development. We are 
playing  at  the  margins  right  now,  in  terms  of  what  is  really  the 
national  emergency,  urgent  issue.  It’s  not  being  treated  that  way. 
Now,  hopefully  we  have  an  opportunity—we  do  have  an  oppor-
tunity,  and  the  Chairman’s  leadership—and  I  appreciate  it  enor-
mously, because this hearing is important and long overdue. 

The  last  question,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Friedman,  or  anybody  on 
the  panel,  again,  I  think  there  are  a  lot  of  opportunities  here.  I 
think  there’s  an  enormous  amount  of  money  to  be  made.  I  think 
we  can  resuscitate  the  industry.  I  think  there’s  just  a  brilliant  op-
portunity  staring  us  in  the  face,  with  the  right  marketing  and  the

right  joint  venture  partnership  here.  Mr.  Reuther  is  articulating 
concerns about what this does to the industry if we don’t put these 
other  pieces  in  place.  Do  you  accept  the  notion  that  we  also  have 
a responsibility to try to put these incentives and cushions in place 
in order to facilitate this transition? 

Mr. FRIEDMAN. Well, I think you’ve actually heard a remarkable 
amount  of  agreement  today.  Everyone  says  cars  need  to  do  some-
thing,  but  so  does  the  rest  of  the  economy.  And  I  think  you  will 
probably  get  a  lot  of  agreement  that  we  need  incentives.  Auto-
makers  are  going  to  be  able  to  increase  profits  by  selling  higher 
fuel  economy  cars  and  trucks.  Why?  In  part,  because  if  consumers 
are spending less money on gasoline, they can buy better cars, they 
can  buy  more  expensive  cars.  They  can  also,  maybe,  rent  an  extra 
DVD  or  also  spend  some  time  creating  jobs  in  other  parts  of  the 
economy.  But,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  increasing  fuel  economy  will 
increase profits and increase jobs in the auto industry. 

Are there going to be transition costs? Absolutely. Are you going 
to  need  to  make  investments  in  technology?  Absolutely.  Is  there  a 
role  for  the  Government  to  play  to  help  industry  making  those  in-
vestments? Absolutely. Consumers are in a position to save tens of 
billions of dollars a year. Consumers’ savings will dwarf the invest-
ment  cost  to  the  auto  industry.  So,  it  absolutely  makes  sense  for 
consumer tax dollars to help the industry along the way. 

It  also  makes  sense  to  recycle  some  of  those  tax  dollars  to  help 
steer  consumers  toward  better  vehicles.  I  think  part  of  the  chal-
lenge  here  is,  we  absolutely  need  to  address  all  parts  of  the  issue, 
but you’ve got to start. You’ve got to start walking before you run. 
And the way you start is by raising fuel economy standards. 

I  sat  before  you,  about  6  years  ago,  December  of  2001,  talking 
about  this  very  issue.  You  were  chairing  this  Committee.  And  we 
were talking about 40 miles per gallon back then. We’ve gone back-
ward  in  some  ways,  despite  the  fact  that  technology  has  gone  for-
wards. So, absolutely can we do more. 

Can we switch to fuel-cell vehicles tomorrow? No. Can we switch 
to  plug-in  vehicles  tomorrow?  No.  These  are  really  exciting  tech-
nologies,  and  they  will  have  a  substantial  role  to  play  20  or  30 
years from now. Ten years ago, I helped build a plug-in hybrid ve-
hicle while I was studying engineering in graduate school. We took 
a  Ford  Taurus,  we  converted  it  into  a  plug-in,  and  we  got  over  60 
miles  per  gallon.  Clearly,  it  can  be  done.  But  right  now,  the  bat-
teries  are  too  expensive,  and  they  don’t  last  long  enough.  You  can 
do it in small volume, but not yet in large volume. 

Fuel-cell  vehicles  are  too  expensive  right  now.  But  that  doesn’t 
mean  we  should  stand  still.  We  should  invest  in  that  technology. 
But  in  that  10-year  window  you  talked  about,  the  single  biggest 
thing  that  we  can  do  to  cut  our  oil  dependence  and  reduce  global 
warming pollution is to invest in auto mechanics, is to invest in en-
gineering,  it’s  to  take  these  simple  steps  with  technologies  auto-
makers have already developed, that can raise fuel economy stand-
ards, by our analysis, to 40 miles per gallon over 10 years. I’ll take 
35 to start, but we can definitely go farther. 

I  also,  just  quickly,  in  mentioning  the  price  issue,  I  have  to  say 
that  I’m  a  little  concerned.  It’s  a  little  disingenuous  to  hear  the 
auto industry talking about gas prices, when I don’t really hear the

auto industry lobbying to raise gas taxes. It also concerns me a lit-
tle  bit  that  the  auto  industry  is  talking  about  Europe,  where  gas 
prices  are  higher,  and  they  absolutely  are,  and  fuel  economy  is 
higher,  but  it’s  not  high  enough.  The  European  Union  is  setting 
standards to reduce global warming pollution from cars and trucks, 
because their prices haven’t been enough. So, even $6 a gallon gas-
oline in Europe isn’t enough. Before we raise prices for consumers, 
let’s  save  them  money.  Maybe  down  that  road  we’ll  need  to  invest 
money  in  highways  and  make  sure  that  we  can  do  that,  but  let’s 
start  off  by  saving  consumers  money,  providing  them  incentives, 
and getting better fuels out there. 

Senator KERRY. Thank you very much. 
Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  the  time.  And,  as  I  close,  I’d  just 
mention, I hope we will work through this issue. You know, I don’t 
know  which  one  we’re  going  to  wind  up  with,  or  where,  but  I  just 
have  a  concern  about  the  off-ramp  piece,  just  given  the  record  and 
experience  we’ve  had  on  NHTSA  and  so  forth.  I  think  we’ve  got  to 
really  be  firm  here,  and  strong.  So,  I  want  to  work  through  it.  I 
talked  to  Fred  Smith  earlier  today,  and  want  to  follow  up  on  how 
we might think about it. 

But, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. You’ve been very gen-
erous  with  the  time.  And  I  thank  my  colleague  from  Delaware  for 
his patience. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Carper? 
Senator CARPER. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
To our witnesses, welcome, and thank you very much for joining 
us  today,  and,  for  some  of  you,  for  joining  us  in  recent  days  and 
weeks. 

Mr. Friedman, just a quick thought that comes to mind. Did you 
say  it  was  10  years  ago  that  you  and  some  of  your  colleagues  in 
graduate school worked on a—did you say it was a hybrid? 

Mr. FRIEDMAN. A plug-in hybrid—— 
Senator CARPER. Plug-in hybrid on a—the Ford Taurus? 
Mr. FRIEDMAN. On a Ford Taurus, exactly. 
Senator  CARPER.  I’m  just  wondering  why  Ford  didn’t  hire  you. 
Maybe  if  they  had  hired  you  and  some  of  your  friends,  we’d  still 
be making Ford Tauruses in this country, and selling them around 
the world. 

Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  Well,  frankly,  there  are  a  lot  of  really  talented 
engineers  in  the  auto  industry.  They  don’t  need  me  there.  They’ve 
got a lot of great engineers who have already developed a lot of this 
technology. But, even then, we knew that that plug-in wasn’t quite 
ready.  But  some  of  the  technologies  we  put  in  that  vehicle  were 
ready.  In  fact,  that  vehicle  was  produced  by  Ford  and  made  out  of 
aluminum. The auto industry had the technology to cut the weight 
out  of  cars  and  trucks  while  maintaining,  or  even  improving,  safe-
ty, and increasing fuel economy. We also put in a more efficient en-
gine design at that time. Many of those technologies are still here. 
The challenge I think we’ve heard before is, for the last 10 years— 
and  really  for  the  last  20  years—most  of  that  technology  has  gone 
to  nearly  doubling  the  power  of  our  cars  and  trucks.  A  family  car 
today—you  can  buy  a  family  car  that  accelerates  as  fast  as  a  late- 
1960s  Mustang  or  a  late-1960s  Porsche  911.  That’s  great.  Let’s

keep  it.  That’s  what  we  did  for  the  last  20  years.  But  let’s  spend 
the  next  20  years  taking  the  technology  we’ve  got  to  increase  fuel 
economy. 

Senator CARPER. Good. Thank you for that comment and for your 

Mr. Chairman, there are just a couple of things I want to get off 

my chest, and then I want to ask a question or two. 

insights. 

And  some  of  the  folks  in  the  audience  here  have  heard  me  say 

this before. I would just ask you to be indulgent with me. 

Lee Iacocca has a new book out. I think it’s, maybe, titled, ‘‘Lead-
ership’’. And he was interviewed recently on NPR. They were talk-
ing  about  the  auto  industry  and  how  we  ended  up  in  the  situation 
where  we  have  figured  out  how  to  lose  market  share,  close  plants, 
lay  off  employees,  and  lose  a  ton  of  money  over  the  last  10  or  so 
years,  even  longer  than  that.  And  he  said—I’ll  paraphrase  him— 
he said we weren’t very smart. What he actually said, I think—I’m 
told he said we were very stupid. And, you know, it’s easier on this 
side  of  the  dais,  looking  at  the  industry.  But  we  could  have  gone 
to flexible manufacturing, where you’d make not just one vehicle in 
a plant, but maybe two, maybe three, maybe four; you’d be able to 
vary  your  production  for  the  different  vehicles  in  accordance  with 
what’s  being  demanded  by  the  marketplace.  Or  you’d  have  a  pilot 
vehicle  that  you’re  working  on,  we  could  have  done  that.  Frankly, 
we’re sort of, ‘‘Johnny come lately’s’’ on it. 

Alan  Reuther  says,  with  great  precision  and  accuracy,  we  spend 
a  whole  lot  more  money  on  healthcare  for  the  folks  that  are  build-
ing  a—we’ll  say,  a  Durango  that  we  build  in  Newark,  Delaware, 
compared to what they spend building a similar kind of SUV in an-
other part of the world. 

Having  said  that,  though,  there  are  a  lot  of  things  we  can  do  to 
reduce the cost of healthcare in this country, and I’m just going to 
go  through  a  real  quick  list,  real  quick.  We  can  harness  health  in-
formation technology. We can incentivize folks to actually take bet-
ter  care  of  themselves,  to  exercise,  to  eat  the  right  foods,  to  not 
smoke,  not  drink  to  excess.  We  can  do  those  things.  We  can  do  a 
better job of chronic disease management. We can adopt things like 
stem cell research, whether you want to get embryonic stem cell or 
different kinds. We can build more community-based health centers 
so that folks have, right in their communities, access to healthcare, 
that  they’re  not  using  the  hospital  emergency  rooms.  We  can  put 
employee-based  health  clinics  for  primary  healthcare  right  in 
places  where  folks  work.  We  can  institute  pay  for  performance, 
where  we  actually  are  paying  for  better  healthcare  and  better  re-
sults.  We  can  actually  use  the  mapping  of  the  human  genome  to 
develop  what  I  call  boutique  drugs  that  target  in  on  certain  popu-
lations that are going to be helped more by small molecule or large 
molecule drugs. We can help incentivize the creation of small busi-
ness  purchasing  pools  to  enable  small  businesses  to  have  the  kind 
of  advantages  that  we  have  as  Federal  employees.  We  can  better 
inform  consumers  in  consumer-directed  health  insurance,  about 
health  savings  accounts,  so  they’ll  make  the  right  kinds  of  deci-
sions.  We  can  help  bring  down  the  cost  of  defensive  medicine.  We 
can  do  that.  It’s  not  just  the  folks  sitting  here  on  this  panel,  but

the  industry,  the  economy,  a  lot  of  our  folks.  There’s  a  lot  that  we 
can do. 

If  we’re  really  smart,  the  auto  industry  and  other  industries  in 
this  country  will  figure  out  how  to  do  a  variety  of  those,  to  help 
rein  in  the  grown  of  healthcare  costs.  And  I  hope  we’ll  be  that 
smart. 

I want to—under the banner of ‘‘we weren’t very smart,’’ go back 
to Lee Iacocca. I remember a conversation I had with the leader in 
one  of  our  Big  Three  auto  companies  back  in  2001.  I  think,  Mr. 
Friedman,  you  talked  about  testifying  for  a  panel  that  Senator 
Kerry was a part of. That same year, I remember being in Detroit, 
meeting  with  the  leader  of  one  of  our  auto  companies,  I  said  to 
him, ‘‘Doesn’t it frost you that we’re letting Honda and Toyota steal 
an environmental march on you, and we’re not creating, really, any 
product  to  compete  in  that  sector,  something  highly  energy  effi-
cient?’’  And  he  said  to  me  at  the  time,  he  said,  ‘‘You  know,  for 
every  Prius  that  they  build  over  at  Toyota,  they’re  going  to  lose 
$20,000.’’  They  may  lose  some  money  on  Priuses  but  one  of  the 
things they do is use that to draw people into the showrooms. And 
if  they  don’t  buy  a  Prius,  they  buy  something  else.  That’s  smart. 
And our friends at GM have learned how to build Pontiac Solstices, 
at  a  loss.  They  build  them  in  Wilmington,  Delaware.  They  don’t 
make  money  on  them,  but  it  brings  a  lot  of  people  into  Pontiac 
showrooms,  and  they  buy  something  else.  They’ve  learned  how  to 
build Saturn Skyes. They lose a little money, I believe, on the Sat-
urn  Skyes,  but  it  sure  brings  a  whole  lot  of  people  into  the  show-
room. I think maybe Toyota figured that out with the Prius. Even-
tually, they may be smart enough to figure out how to make money 
on them. They’re also smart enough to figure out how to make not 
one  vehicle  in  a  plant,  not  two  vehicles—maybe  not  three—but 
maybe four. We ought to be that smart, as well. 

Under  the  banner  of  ‘‘we  weren’t  very  smart,’’  same  company, 
someone—a  fairly  senior  guy  there  said  to  me—we  were  talking 
about  energy  efficient  vehicles,  and  he  said,  ‘‘Well,  we’re  going  to 
put  our  eggs  in  the  fuel-cell  basket.’’  This  is  6  years  ago.  ‘‘We’re 
going  to  put  our  eggs  in  the  fuel-cell  basket,  because  that’s  where 
we think the future lies.’’ And I’d say, ‘‘Shouldn’t there be a bridge 
to  the  future?  Maybe,  shouldn’t  there  be  something  like  a  hybrid 
or like a flex-fuel hybrid, or a plug-in hybrid bridge to the future?’’ 
At  the  time,  6  years  ago,  ‘‘No,  the  future  is  fuel  cells,  and  that’s 
where we’re going to invest our money.’’ To their credit, the hottest 
car  I  saw  unveiled  at  the  Detroit  Auto  Show  this  year  was  the 
Chevrolet  Volt.  A  great-looking  vehicle.  It’s  smart.  It’s  not  just  a 
plug-in  hybrid.  It  recharges  the  battery  by  putting  on  the  brakes. 
It’s  a  plug-in  hybrid  with  a  flexible-fuel  power  generator  with  it. 
The  battery  runs  the  wheels  and  you  recharge  the  battery  when 
you  put  on  the  brakes.  You  also  recharge  the  battery  with  a  fuel- 
cell power system onboard, or a diesel-powered system, or an inter-
nal combustion engine onboard. They’re always recharging the bat-
tery.  That  is  so  smart.  And  as  some  of  you  have  said,  the  impedi-
ment  for  us  is:  How  do  we—play  catchup  with  the  Japanese  and 
others  on  the  battery  technology?  And  we’re  going  to  come  back  to 
that in just a moment.

the 

folks 

But  the  idea  for  us  to  have  been  saying,  6  years  ago,  ‘‘We’re 
going  to  put  all  of  our  eggs  in  the  fuel-cell  basket.  There  doesn’t 
have  to  be  a  bridge  to  the  future’’—now  we  realize  there  does. 
We’re just behind the eight ball. 

And  last  rant  and  then  I’ll  get  over  it,  and  then  I’ll,  maybe,  ask 
a  question  or  two.  We  have  a  DaimlerChrysler  plant  in  my  state. 
It’s in Newark, Delaware, just south of the University of Delaware, 
right off of I–95. When I was State Treasurer, a million years ago, 
I actually negotiated a State’s loan to Chrysler to help—along with 
other  states  and  the  Federal  Government—to  help  save  the  com-
pany when it was about to go under. This is something I care about 
a  whole  lot,  and  have  thought  about  a  whole  lot.  That’s  a  plant 
that has been on the bubble for a long time. 

2001,  my  first  year,  I  had  just  stepped  down  as  Governor,  been 
elected  to  the  Senate,  2001,  and  had  a  meeting  here  in  Wash-
ington.  Senator  Biden,  Congressman  Castle  and  myself  had  the 
privilege  of  meeting  with  a  number  of 
from 
DaimlerChrysler.  At  the  time  DamilerChrysler  was  saying,  ‘‘We’re 
going to try to figure out whether to build a second-generation Du-
rango,  and  where  to  build  it,  if  we  do.’’  And  the  great  news  they 
shared with us that day: they’re going to build a second-generation 
Durango. We were delighted. The first one was being built in New-
ark, Delaware. They said, ‘‘We’re going to build the vehicle in Dela-
ware,’’  so  that  was  great  news.  And  they  said,  ‘‘The  third  piece  of 
good  news  is  that  we’re  going  to  offer  a  hybrid  option  starting  in 
2004.’’  Bingo.  It  was  like  the  hat  trick,  it  was  a  triple  play.  And 
we  were  delighted,  and  left  the  meeting.  A  year  later,  we  got  back 
together  with  the  same  folks,  you  know,  from  DaimlerChrysler, 
‘‘Still  going  to  build  a  second-generation  Durango,  still  going  to 
build it in Newark, Delaware. We’re not going to offer a hybrid op-
tion.’’ 

Now,  last  year,  when  gas  prices  rose  over  $3  a  gallon,  it  was 
about  150-day  inventory  of  unsold  Durangos  in  dealer  lots  across 
the  country.  You  know,  we’re  really—Iacocca’s  right,  sometimes, 
not  very  smart.  Smart  thing,  though,  that  we  did  in—on  the  tail 
end of that is, our friends from GM, DaimlerChrysler, BMW got to-
gether, created a partnership, a consortium, and now that partner-
ship  has  led  to  the  creation  of  a  new  next-generation  hybrid. 
They’re  going  to  be  in  Dodge  Durangos  next  year.  They’ll  be  in 
Chrysler  Aspens  next  year.  That’s  wonderful.  It’s  too  bad  they 
weren’t in them 2–3 years ago. 

All  right,  I’ve  got  that  off  my  chest.  Thank  you  for  bearing  with 

me. That’ll give us all something to think about. 

One of the great values of having panel like this—and I thought 
about this when Senators Levin, Feinstein, and Stabenow were be-
fore  us—I  thought,  if  we  could  get  the  three  of  them  to  agree  on 
a  path  forward,  we  could  probably  get  something  done,  and  some-
thing  good  for  our  country.  Just  sitting  here  today,  Mr.  Chairman, 
looking  at  this  panel,  I’m  thinking,  you  know,  if  we  can  get  this 
panel to agree on a path forward, it would probably be pretty good 
for our country and for the industry, as well. 

As I’ve listened to y’all speak here today and our Senators before 
you,  a  couple  of  things  have  come  to  my  mind  that  we  agree  on. 
I want to ask, Are we in agreement on this?

72 

One,  I  think  we  agree  that  the  status  quo  is  unacceptable.  I 
think  we  agree  that  we  have  a  great  deal  at  stake  here,  in  terms 
of  our  national  security—not  just  our  economic  security,  but  our 
national  security.  I  think  we  agree  on  that.  I  think  we  agree  that 
we need to get started, sooner rather than later, but there’s a need 
to  acknowledge  that  there  are  start-up  delays  because  of  tech-
nology.  You  just  can’t  turn  a  crank  and  do  this  overnight,  produce 
the  vehicles  overnight,  because  of  the—R&D,  engineering,  devel-
oping the parts, and so forth. But, over time, we can do better. But 
we need to get started. I think we agree on that. 

I think I heard consensus here today that for manufacturers that 
do  get  started  earlier,  they  ought  to  get  credit  for  early  action.  I 
think I heard consensus on that. 

I think I heard consensus on the need for whatever approach we 
take,  whether  we  take  the  attribute  approach—which  I  think 
makes  sense,  and  I  think  others  do,  too—that  there  be  some  exit 
ramps.  In  case  we  have  missed  something  here,  if  the  world 
changes in some way that we haven’t thought about, that there are 
sort of escape valves—not easy ones, but real ones. I think, for the 
most part, I’ve heard us say that. 

I  think  that  we  agree  on  the  need  to  have  not  just  a  focus  on, 
fuel  efficiency,  but  also  this  issue  of  vehicle  miles  traveled.  We’ve 
got to think about not just how much fuel we’re using in our vehi-
cles, but how do we get people out of their vehicles sometimes. How 
do we actually deal with land use to promote that? I think I heard 
us  agree  on  biofuels,  say  we  need  to  turn  some  of  those  cornfields 
into  oil  fields,  and  some  of  those  soybeans  into  oil  fields.  I  believe 
I heard a number of people say that. 

A  couple  of  you  talked  about  a  way  to  sort  of  morph  from  a 
CAFE-based approach to a more of an economy-wide approach that 
deals  with  CO2—to  find  a  way  to  morph  from  one  to  the  other  as 
a good approach. I think I heard folks say that. 

Here’s  my  question.  Did  I  misstate  any  of  those?  In  terms  of 
things  that  we  agree  on.  Secondly,  how  do  we  not  just  say  to  the 
industry,  ‘‘We’re  going  to  have  this  tough-love  approach  with  you 
on fuel efficiency and trying to change gears here’’? How do we help 
them?  How  do  we  help  the  industry?  I  know  Mr.  Reuther  has 
called for us doing a good deal more on healthcare. I’m going to set 
that  aside  for  right  now.  But  how  do  we  help  the  industry,  espe-
cially the domestic industry? 

I  think  I’ve  heard  some  of  you  say,  ‘‘Invest  in  new  battery  tech-
nology.  It’s  one  of  the  best  things  we  can  do.’’  Does  it  make  sense 
for  us  to  try  to  find  a  way  to  include  in  the  legislation  that  we’re 
going to take to the floor or bring up on the floor authorization for 
significant  new  investments  over,  maybe,  a  5-year  period  of  time, 
but  a  multiyear  period  of  time,  in  new  battery  technology?  Does  it 
make sense for us to include in the legislation that we move, either 
out of this Committee or on the floor, biofuel standards, to actually 
create  a  biofuel  standard  for—B20  or  B30  fuel  for  greater  biofuel 
content  in  our  diesel?  Does  it  make  sense  to  try  to  include  some 
adjustments  of  our  tax  credit  for  low-emission  diesel  so  that—for 
example,  does  DaimlerChrysler,  whose  BLUETEC  technologies  is 
actually  going  to  produce—is  producing  a  Bin8—not  Bin5,  but  a

73 

Bin8  emission  vehicle?  Does  it  make  sense  to  try  to  move  up  their 
eligibility to use Bin8 as a basis for consumer tax credit? 

Finally,  does  it  make  sense  for  us  to  include  in  the  language  we 
take  to  the  floor  further  incentives,  for  the  creation  of  additional 
biofuels?  I’ll  tell  you  what  I  have  in  mind.  Not  just  how  we  turn 
corncobs into ethanol. How do we turn cellulosic materials into eth-
anol?  Also,  how  do  we  develop  follow-on  biofuels,  like  biobutanol? 
At the DuPont company, do you know we’re making biobutanol out 
of  sugar  beets?  We  can  make  it  out  of  switchgrass  and  a  lot  of 
other  waste  materials.  Should  we  use  this  legislation  as  a  way  to 
incentivize  not  just  R&D  on  that  stuff,  but  to  actually  commer-
cialize the technology? 

What  do  we  append  to  this  legislation  of  the,  four  areas  that  I 
discussed, things that can actually help the industry, but also help 
reduce our country’s dependence on foreign oil? 

Thank you. 
Mr. REUTHER. Senator, if I could say I think assistance with bat-
tery development is important, but I don’t think that should be the 
only  thing.  The  retooling  costs  that  the  companies  are  going  to 
have to incur to meet significantly higher CAFE standards are very 
large, and I think there’s a role for this Committee and the Senate 
to  play  in  helping  to  provide  that  assistance  through  loan  guaran-
tees or otherwise. 

Yes,  we’ve  talked  about  healthcare,  but  it’s  not  just  healthcare, 
it’s  the  whole  range  of  retooling  costs.  And,  you  know,  there  has 
been  a  lot  of  talk  on  the  panel  in—today  about  the  national  secu-
rity  importance  of  reducing  oil  consumption.  And  we  agree  with 
that. But if you’re talking about national security, that’s something 
that  benefits  the  whole  country,  and  we  share  the  cost  of  our  na-
tional  defense.  And  we  think  a  similar  rationale  applies  here,  that 
we should be sharing, as a country, the cost of having the industry 
have these retooling costs, not have the costs all borne by the work-
ers and retirees in the industry. 

Senator CARPER. All right, thank you. Again, let’s just say to the 
panel,  my  questions—just  so  we’re  clear—of  those  things—I  went 
through  about  eight  or  nine  elements  of  things  that  I  thought  we 
agreed  on,  or  I  think  we—I  heard  us  agree  on.  And  I  want—did  I 
miss  something?  Did  I  misstate  something?  And  next,  in  terms  of 
reporting  language  out  of  here,  a  bill  out  of  here  next  week,  to  go 
to the floor, should we try to append to it some of the—I mentioned 
about  four  ideas  to  try  to  add  either  on  the—in  the  Committee  or 
on the floor. So, those are my questions. 

Yes. Mr. Friedman? 
Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  Senator—should  I  go  down  the  line?  Thank  you. 
Well, relative to the list that you went through, I would say, gen-
erally,  I  think  we  agree  very  strongly  with  the  majority  of  them. 
One  question  is  exit  ramps.  I  think  we  have  to  think  very,  very 
carefully  about  exit  ramps.  At  a  minimum,  we  know  we’ve  got  the 
technology  to  hit  at  least  35  miles  per  gallon  over  the  next  10 
years.  Maybe  after  that,  it  might  be  time  for  some  off-ramps.  But, 
for  the  next  10  years,  our  country  needs  to  stay  on  the  highway, 
going at top speed toward cutting our oil dependence. 

Second,  you  asked  about  an  economywide  cap  and  morphing 
CAFE  into  some  sort  of  similar  approach.  Well,  the  great  thing  is, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:03 Mar 21, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80033.TXT JACKIE

74 

actually,  CAFE  is  already  set  up  to  fit  perfectly  well  within  an 
economywide  cap.  How  do  you  reduce  global  warming  pollution 
from  cars?  You  improve  efficiency,  you  use  low-carbon  fuels,  and 
you drive less. Well, if you have a cap on global warming pollution, 
and if you have a standard to increase efficiency, you’ve taken care 
of  one  of  those  things.  What  else  do  you  need?  A  low-carbon  fuel 
standard. I would actually say that’s even better than a renewable 
fuel standard, because you’re directly targeting global warming pol-
lution,  and  you’re  getting  oil  at  the  same  time.  Plus,  you  want  to 
make  sure,  of  course,  that  you’re  growing  those  biofuels 
sustainably. But let’s target the carbon on those, and that way you 
know  how  to  treat  the  different  fuels.  Not  all  biofuels  are  created 
equally.  Let’s  make  sure  we  account  for  that.  And,  of  course,  we 
definitely need policies to reduce VMT. 

Do  we  need  research  for  better  batteries  for  better  fuel  cells,  for 
cellulosic ethanol, for biobutanol—in part, to reduce some of the po-
tential  health  hazards  that  you  could  get  with  low  bends  of  eth-
anol? Absolutely. Government has that role to play. 

Senator CARPER. Good. 
Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  The  Government  also  has  a  role  to  play  to  pro-
vide  incentives  and—there  are  already  tax  credits  for  diesel  vehi-
cles and hybrids. For the largest vehicles, there’s a Bin8 classifica-
tion. Over time, actually, that should come down, because the tech-
nologies you’re talking about, they’re targeting Bin5—— 

Senator  CARPER.  I  think  in  2009  they’ll  have  the  Bin5  ready  to 
roll, and I think in 2008, they’ll still be with Bin8. Thank you very 
much. 

Congressman McCurdy and then Mr. Stanton. 
Mr. MCCURDY. Tom, I actually wrote 12 questions down, so the— 

and it’s a clean dozen, so I’ll put it that way. 

Yes,  the  status  quo  is  unacceptable.  And  the  Alliance—and  I 
know  Mike  Stanton  and  I  agree—between  the  two  of  us,  our  asso-
ciations  represent  probably  100  percent  of—or  99  percent  of  the 
automobile  manufacturers  that  sell  in  the  United  States.  And  we 
both  agree  that  there  has  to  be  fuel-economy  improvements  and 
performance improvements. We support, the reform of a passenger- 
car  rule,  and  we  think  attribute-based  system  makes  sense.  So, 
that is an important step. 

There  is  a  lot  at  stake.  There’s  not  only  a  lot  at  stake  inter-
nationally from the climate change issue, but also economic and na-
tional security. 

We do want to get started. CAFE doesn’t really kick-start action 
on  climate  change  but  there  are  other  things  that  can  do  it,  and 
some  of  the  things  that  you  mentioned  are  not  contingent  on 
CAFE. 

I  do  want  to  spend  a  few  minutes  on  exit  ramps,  but  I’m  going 

to leave it until last. 

Biofuels,  yes,  absolutely.  Flex-fuels  are  important.  I  think  Con-
gress has to be a little careful, though, not to get swept up and try 
to  pick  winners  and  losers.  The  agriculture  community  is  looking 
very  excitedly  at  some  of  the  technologies,  and  that’s  important, 
but  long-term  cellulosic  and  other  types  of  ethanol  production  are 
critical,  and  enzyme  production,  all  those  things  that  go  with  that 
are critical.

I  do  believe  that  it  makes  sense  to—and  I  believe—because  our 
CEOs  testified  before  the  Congress  and  made  a  commitment  that 
they would work toward a—an economywide cap-and-trade system. 
The reason they did that is not to shift the cost from the transpor-
tation  sector,  or  from  just  automotives.  We  believe  it  is  a  national 
problem. It’s a global problem. It’s not a State problem, or local. It’s 
a global problem. We have to deal with China and India and other 
developing countries, but we do believe it’s time to step up and try 
to  do  that.  A  good  place  to  start  is  in  transportation,  by  including 
the fuels that you mentioned here. 

There  is—biofuels  standards,  absolutely.  You  know,  MIL  Spec— 
we know, where there’s a B20, there could be a civilian on commer-
cial B20. They’re the kinds of steps that are important. 

Tax credits are good for consumers. And I think there need to be 

other incentives. 

Mr.  Friedman  mentioned  exit  ramps,  and  Senator  Kerry  did,  as 

well. When you look at the—— 

can hear from Mr. Stanton. 

Senator  CARPER.  I’m  going  to  ask  you  to  sum  up  quickly  so  we 

Mr. MCCURDY. OK. 
Senator CARPER.The Chairman has been very—— 
Mr. MCCURDY. And if you’ve like to have a—— 
Senator CARPER.—generous with his time. 
Mr.  MCCURDY.—separate  discussion  on  off-ramps,  we  could  do 
that after this, because I don’t want to interrupt the flow with the 
rest. 

But I do think it’s worth bearing just a couple of minutes on the 

off-ramps, of what it really means, and that they’re serious. 

Senator CARPER. OK, good. Well, let’s have that conversation. I’m 

sure we will. 

Mr. Stanton? 
Mr.  STANTON.  I’ll,  kind  of,  pick  up  there,  because  the  off-ramps 

are very important to us, too. 

Senator CARPER. OK. 
Mr.  STANTON.  Obviously,  we  don’t  know  what  the  world’s  going 
to  look  like  in  10  years.  We  are  approaching  this  today—all  of  our 
members  are  because  we  recognize  the  fact  that  we  do  have  a  na-
tional  problem,  and  we  do  have  to  move  forward,  and  we  do  have 
to move forward aggressively. 

One  of  the  recommendations  that  we  would  make  is  that  we 
treat  all  of  the  alternative  fuel  sources  equitably.  We  don’t  know 
whether or not we’re going to get through to cellulosic ethanol. We 
know  we  need  to  do  work  there.  We  know  we  need  to  do  work  on 
battery technology development. We know to do work on raw mate-
rials.  Nickel,  right  now,  is  a  scarcity,  and  we’ve  got  nickel-metal- 
hydride  batteries,  which  we’re  using  a  lot  now  for  the  hybrids. 
Every—obviously,  everyone  would  like  to  go  to  lithium-ion  bat-
teries.  We  need  breakthroughs  to  get  there.  So,  there’s  an  urgency 
about all of this that we want to convey today. 

We  certainly  support  all  that  Dave  said,  the  need  for  the  stand-
ards,  as  well.  We  would  also,  though,  say  that  we’re  very  familiar 
with  the  CAFE  program.  We  know  what  it  is.  We  know  that  it’s 
not  the  answer,  certainly;  it’s  a  part  of  the  answer.  If  there  is 
changing to another metric, like CO2, the truth of the matter is, is

that CO2 is one way of measuring mpgs. You can go back and forth. 
We  just  want  to  make  sure  that,  as  the  Committee  goes  forward, 
we work with you, and we come up with something that is reason-
able.  Our  preference  would  be  that  NHTSA  set  the  requirements 
to do that. We’re sensitive to the need that the members here want 
to  have  a  number.  If  they  pick  a  number,  please  give  us  good  off- 
ramps. 

Senator CARPER. Admiral Blair? 
Admiral  BLAIR.  Yes,  Senator  Carper,  your  grasp  of  all  of  these 
aspects  of  this  problem  is  certainly  impressive.  But  I  just  want  to 
emphasize one major thing. 

I  remember  a  lesson  in  leadership  I  learned  early  on  in  my  ca-
reer  as  a  Navy  officer.  There  was  something  that  really—the  ship 
really had to do, everybody knew we had to do it. I asked for volun-
teers.  Nobody  volunteered.  I  went  back  and  talked  to  some  of  the 
sailors  later  and  said,  ‘‘You  know,  what  happened?  We  all  know 
this  has  to  be  done.  Asked  for  a  volunteer.  Nobody  volunteered.’’ 
Our  sailor  he  said,  XO,  if  this  has  to  be  done,  just  tell  us  to  do  it, 
and  we’ll  do  it,  and  we’ll  support  it.  We  all  know  this  has  to  be 
done.  Polls  show  it  has  to  be  done.  People  just  want  to  be  told  to 
do it, and they’ll do it. 

And  so  this  business  of  getting  a  big  move  that  sets  in  a  stand-
ard  that  we  know  is  achievable  with  some  work,  that  appeals  to 
the  best  in  America,  that  everybody  wants  to  line  up  behind,  I 
think that’s what we need to do, and not get too bogged down into, 
you  know,  a  little  incentive  for  this  guy  and  a  little  one  for  that 
guy  and  so  on.  But  let’s  put  it  out  there,  where  all  the  people  will 
say ‘‘OK, let’s do it.’’ 

Senator CARPER. Thank you. I was an old naval flight officer for 

23 years. I—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator CARPER.—appreciate what you just said. Thank you. 
Admiral MCGINN. Senator—— 
Senator CARPER. Vice Admiral? 
Admiral MCGINN.—I agree with Mr. Friedman on off-ramps. Off- 
ramps,  to  me,  presume  too  much  of  a  high  probability  of  failure. 
We  want  to  be  focused  on  success  and  positive  outcomes.  And  I  do 
believe we have the technology to do that. 

We have a history of legislative action on fuel standards that are 
just  fraught  with  loopholes.  And  we  don’t  want  to  do  that,  going 
forward.  The  problem  is  pretty  clear,  and  the  solution  ought  to  be 
clear. 

I agree with a lot of the comments and subjects that you brought 
up.  Investment  in  the  battery  technology.  It  is  basically  all  about, 
how do you store electrons and can you do it for cars? We also need 
to  be  able  to  do  it  for  renewable  forms  of  energy,  like  wind  energy 
and  solar  energy,  when  the  wind  isn’t  blowing  and  the  sun  isn’t 
shining.  So,  this  type  of  investment—national  investment  and  pri-
vate-sector investment in electron storage, battery storage, is very, 
very important, has a lot of implications for our future. 

Biofuels  are  not  just  about  the  feedstock,  where  it  comes  from. 
We  need  to  be  able  to  break  biomass  down  for  ethanol  production. 
Cellulosic  ethanol  is  an  example  of  that.  But  we  also  need  to  have 
the right kinds of industrial processes or plants that have the abil-

ity to capture and sequester carbon, not just from when we’re doing 
coal  to  electricity  or—but,  when  we’re  doing  ethanol  production  or 
biodiesel production. 

Clean  diesels,  absolutely.  There’s  a  lot  of  good  progress  that  has 
been made, particularly in some of the European countries, that we 
need to either replicate, improve upon, or import. 

Incentives,  selected  incentives  for  consumers  can,  in  fact,  move 
the  market  in  the  right  direction,  but,  as  Admiral  Blair  said,  I 
think  it’s  got  to  be  an  important  message,  ‘‘This  is  the  right  thing 
to do. It’s a real problem. Let’s get moving on it.’’ 

I  think,  also,  there  are  aspects  to  planning  land  use,  that  you 
mentioned,  total—trying  to  reduce  vehicle  miles  traveled.  Tremen-
dously positive. 

But  all  of  that  said,  I  think  the  clarity  of  this  CAFE  legislation 
ought to be unencumbered by too much complexity in amendments. 
It ought to be clear. Yes, those other things are good, and there are 
other  legislative  bills  that  could  deal  with  them  more  directly  and 
more  clearly.  And  my  recommendation  would  be,  let’s  focus  on  the 
major opportunity here, and keep it to that. 

Thank you, sir. 
Senator CARPER. Thank you, all. 
Mr. Chairman, thank you for your patience and generosity. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Klobuchar? 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  allowing  me 
to return with some questions. I was presiding over the Senate, as 
we  do,  many  hours  a  week  as  freshmen.  And  I  got  back  in  time. 
So, I wanted to thank you. 

And  I  appreciated  your  remarks,  Admiral  Blair,  about  putting 
those  standards  in  place.  As  I  said  in  my  opening  comments,  I 
think  the  American  people  are  crying  out  for  that  kind  of  leader-
ship right now. 

I’m  on  the  Agriculture  Committee,  as  well  as  the  Environment 
and  Public  Works  Committee  and  this  one,  so  I,  kind  of,  live  and 
breathe  these  issues.  And  I  knew  things  were  getting  bad  when  I 
came  home  the  other  day  and  my  11-year-old  daughter  was  work-
ing  on  a  big  tagboard,  and  it  had  this  sea  with  these  little  heads 
bobbing  above,  and  I  said,  ‘‘What  are  you  doing?  What  are  those?’’ 
She  said,  ‘‘Those  are  drowning  penguins.’’  She  was  doing  a  report 
on  global  warming.  So,  anyway  hopefully,  she  has  not  been  com-
pletely corrupted by all of this discussion. 

But  I  think  that  as  we  go  forward,  one  of  the  things  I  struggle 
with  is  how  we  make  sure  we  get  to  that  economywide  level  that 
you’re  talking  about,  Mr.  McCurdy.  And  I  understand  that  it  may 
not  all  be  in  one  bill,  but  I  think  we  have  to  start  doing  it  sector 
by  sector.  Certainly,  these  CAFE  standards,  and  doing  them  in  a 
way  that  we  understand  some  of  the  issues  that  have  been  raised 
about the American auto industry, but also, we have to start some-
where,  and  I  think  if  we  are  doing  the  CAFE  standards,  we’re 
doing  some  of  the  building  efficiency  work  that  the  Energy  Com-
mittee  is  working  on.  It’s  going  to  be  a  lot  easier  for  us  to  work 
on some of the power industry in the bills that Senator Carper and 
others have as we go forward. I think you certainly know this isn’t 
going to be singling out one industry as we go forward.

As  I  mentioned,  Minnesota  has  a  huge  growing  biodiesel,  bio-
mass  industry.  I’m  taking  the  lead  in  the  Senate  side  on  the  cel-
lulosic ethanol issue in the Agriculture Committee, because we see 
so much potential there as we move forward and build on the other 
kinds  of  ethanol.  I’m  curious  about  the  flex-fuel  vehicle  issue.  And 
I just would ask both of you at the end there what the percentages 
are  for  how  many  vehicles  we’re  producing  now  that  are  flex-fuel, 
and if left to its own devices, where it’s going. 

Mr. MCCURDY. I’ll take a run at that. Last year, 2006, there were 
1.5  million  flex-fuel  vehicles  sold.  There  are  10.5  million  on  the 
road  today.  The  challenge,  Senator,  is  that  there’s  not  the  appro-
priate  fueling  opportunities  for  those  vehicles.  There’s  just  over 
1,000—I think it’s 1,079—stations that provide E85—— 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. And, Mr. McCurdy, do you know how many 

are in Minnesota? 

Mr. MCCURDY. Most of them. Actually—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. 312. 
Mr.  MCCURDY.  That’s  right.  And  that’s  out  of  177,000  gas  sta-

tions in—— 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Right. 
Mr. MCCURDY.—this country. So, there’s—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Exactly. 
Mr.  MCCURDY.—an  infrastructure  issue  there.  So,  if  ethanol  is 
there, there are some standards issues, there are other issues that 
need  to  be  addressed.  And  this  is  where  we  do  have  to  work  to-
gether. 

There  will  be  more.  And  if  you  look  at  a  map  of  the  United 
States, where those 10 and a half million—there are 17 million ve-
hicles  sold  every  year,  so  you’re  talking  about  10  percent.  That 
would  increase  dramatically,  provided  there  was  fuel.  Unfortu-
nately,  consumers  often  don’t  know  that  they  have  that  capability, 
because it’s not there, they don’t see the fuel. 

And diesel—you know, I’m a big supporter of cellulosic and other 
forms  of  ethanol,  but  I  think  we  really  shouldn’t  neglect  diesel. 
Fifty  percent  or  more  of  the  vehicles  in  Europe,  where  they  have 
25  to  30  percent  more  fuel  efficiency—and  they  aren’t  compro-
mising on size and weight with that. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. And also, I mean—— 
Mr. MCCURDY.—is an important technology—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR.—diesel—I’m sorry to interrupt, but—— 
Mr. MCCURDY. Biodiesel is an important—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Right. 
Mr.  MCCURDY.—part  of  it.  The  Senator  from  North  Dakota, 
who’s  not  here,  they’re  just  producing  the  canola  bean  factory  in 
biodiesel. So, there’s a lot going on there, and I think it’s an impor-
tant component of this, and we support it. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Given that biodiesel’s more fuel efficient, do 
you think that the higher CAFE standard would actually encourage 
the promotion of more biodiesel and production if it? 

Mr.  MCCURDY.  No,  I  actually  think  where  you  get  to  that  is  if 
you are looking at a cap-and-trade, that you have some fuel stand-
ards,  and  you  bring  the  fuels  into  the  transportation  mix.  If  you 
look  at  the  amount  of  transportation  fuels  that  are  in  the  system, 
it  is  a  significant  part,  but  that’s—autos  and  light  trucks  are  one-

half of the transportation fuels. That’s a lot of carbon going into it. 
It’s  actually  2,000  million  metric  tons.  That’s  something  that  you 
could  capture.  And  I  think—if  you  were  looking  at  the  broader 
sense. So, we’re part of that. We’re half of that. But there’s a whole 
bunch  more  that  you  could  capture.  And  that’s  where  these  other 
standards on specs on B20 and others really come into play. 

Mr.  STANTON.  And,  Senator,  from  our  point  of  view—we  support 
the  research,  development,  and  use  of  all  biofuels,  but  we  think 
that  the  jury’s  still  out  on  which  ones  will  eventually  be  the  win-
ners. Maybe there’s a shared market for each one of the fuels. But 
it’s  still  early  in  the  process,  quite  honestly.  We  need  the  break-
through on the enzymes on the cellulose. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Mr. Friedman? 
Mr. FRIEDMAN. Thank you. 
I  think  everyone  is  justifiably  excited  about  the  potential  for 
biofuels.  They  are,  among  the  alternative  fuels,  probably  the  tech-
nology that is likely to be brought on the quickest, especially if we 
put smart policy in to support to them. 

One  of  the  problems  today,  though,  is  our  fuel  economy  policy  is 
not smart about some of the biofuels. There’s a loophole in the cur-
rent fuel economy policy that gives credit to flex-fuel vehicles, even 
if they’re not using alternative fuels. Now, does that mean flexible- 
fuel vehicles are bad? Of course not. It just means we need to close 
a  loophole  that’s  draining  away  and  increasing  some  of  our  oil  de-
pendence.  I  think  we  should  just  ask  the  auto  industry  to  follow 
through  on  what  they’ve  talked  about,  in  terms  of  the  potential  to 
deliver  about  half  their  fleet  as  flex-fuel  vehicles.  I  think  con-
sumers  would  gladly  pay  an  extra  $50  or  $100  to  know  that  they 
can  fill  up  their  tank  with  an  alternative  fuel.  Of  course,  we  need 
the  infrastructure,  and  your  state  has  clearly  been  a  leader.  We 
need to replicate that around the country. And we need low-carbon 
fuel standards to get us out there. 

One  other  important  issue  about  biodiesel  that  you  mentioned, 
one of the challenges for many consumers today is, most diesel en-
gines  are  only  warranteed  to  about  5  percent  biodiesel.  So,  one 
other  things  I’m  looking  forward  to  is  the  auto  industry  bumping 
up  that  warranty,  getting  in  the  technology  on  those  diesels,  so 
that  you  can  take  advantage  of  the  efficiency  benefit  of  a  diesel, 
about 25 percent, plus, where you can get it, the biodiesel benefits, 
as well. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  So,  do  you  think  raising  the  CAFE  stand-

ards is helping to promote the production of biodiesel? 

Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  I  would  argue  CAFE’s  focus  is  vehicle  efficiency. 
If  you  make  a  dedicated  alternative-fuel  vehicle,  then,  yes,  it  can 
have  an  impact.  But  right  now,  we’re—the  vehicles  are  focused  on 
flexible  fuel,  and  so,  you  can’t  guarantee  they’re  actually  going  to 
use  the  fuel.  Maybe  you  can  change  that  loophole  so  that  you  get 
credit based on the previous year’s alternative-fuel use. But I think 
the  best  way  is  just  to—let’s  get  the  vehicles  out  there,  with  one 
policy.  Let’s  get  the  fuels  out  there,  with  a  low-carbon  fuel  policy. 
I  think—you  know,  as  other  people  have  said,  maybe  you  don’t 
marry them, maybe you do. I think it depends on what the Senate 
can deliver in the next few months. But let’s just not let the perfect

80 

be  the  enemy  of  the  good.  There  are  a  lot  of  really  good  solutions 
out there. 

Mr.  MCCURDY.  Since  you’re  on  the  Agriculture  Committee,  you 
know about the chicken and the egg. The problem is, you’re requir-
ing the vehicles to be produced, but there’s no fuel. If the fuel’s not 
there,  how  in  the  world  are  they  going  to  be  able  to  do  it?  So,  it 
is  a  tremendous  technology,  it  should  be  explored,  it  can  be  ex-
panded. But, again, you’re putting all of it on one sector. In the fuel 
sector,  let  me  tell  you,  they’re  not  losing  money.  They  actually 
ought  to  be  in  to—in  this  system.  So,  I  think  that’s  something 
that—I  know  the  other  committees  of  jurisdiction  are  looking  at 
that.  The  difference  between  the  House  and  the  Senate,  there  you 
have one big Committee that’s pulling all this together—— 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Well—— 
Mr. MCCURDY.—here it’s a little more—— 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.—I  just  think  we  should  think  of  it  that 
there  are  a  lot  of  eggs  being  laid  everywhere.  And  I  would—part 
of this is getting some incentives, which we’re working on, as well, 
into  the  Agriculture  bill,  to  help  farmers  and  co-ops  and  to  put 
more  of  these  pumps  in  place.  Part  of  it  is  making  sure  that  we 
have  these  flex-fuel  vehicles,  and  getting  that  in  place.  And  the 
other  is,  as  we’ve  talked  about  all  day  today,  raising  the  CAFE 
standards  in  a  way  that  is  not  going  to  destroy  our  auto  industry, 
but  in  a  way  that  encourages  some  changes  that  we  just  haven’t 
been seeing the last few years. 

Thank you. 
Mr.  MCCURDY.  Senator  Carper,  could  we  revisit,  for  just  1 

minute, your off-ramp issue? 

The CHAIRMAN. Is it my turn now? 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. MCCURDY. Mr. Chairman—— 
Senator CARPER. We yield to the Chairman. 
Mr. MCCURDY.—you always control the table. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  With  all  the  discussions  we’ve  had  this  after-
noon,  my  announcement  may  come  as  a  surprise.  This  bill  before 
us  will  be  on  a  markup  next  Tuesday.  However,  based  upon  your 
testimony,  and  upon  the  studies  that  we  have  made,  we  have  con-
cluded  that  there’s  much  agreement  among  us.  One,  that  there’s  a 
fuel  problem,  an  energy  problem.  As  the  Admiral  stated,  our  na-
tional  security  is  dependent  upon  the  availability—steady  avail-
ability  of  fuel.  We  know  that  none  of  us  here  want  to  put  our  do-
mestic  auto  manufacturers  out  of  business.  We  want  to  keep  them 
not  only  alive,  but  prosperous.  Based  upon  this,  the  Committee 
staff,  together  with  the  staffs  of  Senator  Stevens,  Senator  Snowe, 
Senator  Smith,  Senator  Dorgan,  in  consultation  with  the  staff  of 
Senator  Levin  and  Senator  Feinstein,  have  been  working,  for  the 
last 10 days, day and night. I feel confident enough to tell you that, 
by tomorrow, close of business, we will have a bill, a managers’ bill, 
which  we  will  present—we  will  send  copies  to  all  of  you,  and  we 
will present at the markup on Tuesday as a substitute to the Fein-
stein bill. I think you’ll be pleased with it. Not completely, but suf-
ficiently. 

It  will  not  have  credits  in  it,  because  that’s  not  within  the  juris-
diction  of  this  Committee,  but  we  will  be  recommending  that  that

81 

be seriously considered. And I’m certain that when this measure is 
considered on the floor, some amendment will be presented to pro-
vide tax credits and grants. 

The record will be kept open for another 2 weeks. Now, you may 
be  wondering  why  the  record  will  be  kept  open  for  2  weeks  when 
the  markup  is  on  Tuesday.  I’ve  been  in  this  business  now  for  50 
years, and I know that the best way to legislate is to have a target. 
If  we  have  a  managers’  bill,  you’ll  have  something  to  work  upon. 
If you have five bills, you don’t know which one to hit. You’ll have 
one  bill  to  hit.  And  we  invite  all  of  you  to  study  the  managers’ 
package  and  come  forth  with  any  modification  you  wish  to  make. 
You will find that most of your concerns have been addressed. 

Having  said  that,  I  have  just  one  question  to  ask.  It  will  not  be 
part of this bill, but it is an energy question. It’s obvious to me that 
you cannot develop an automobile in 6 months that will come forth 
with  the  golden  answer.  It’s  going  to  take  some  time  to  do  some 
research and some development and you don’t produce a new vehi-
cle  in  a  year.  It  takes  a  little  while.  I  think  it’s  obvious  that  we 
will still be dependent upon a foreign source of fuel. Even if we do 
pass the bill, you’ll still be dependent upon foreign energy. 

So,  my  question  is,  what  are  your  thoughts  on  ANWR?  I  realize 
it’s a very contentious, controversial question. But geologists tell us 
that  the  oil  supply  in  ANWR  is  equivalent  to  that  in  the  oil  fields 
of Saudi Arabia. 

Let’s go down the line. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr.  REUTHER.  Quite  frankly,  we’ve  had  our  hands  full  dealing 

with the CAFE issue. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. REUTHER. I would defer to others on ANWR. 
Mr.  FRIEDMAN.  Senator,  there  have  been  studies  that  have 
shown that tapping into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would, 
maybe, affect gasoline prices by about a penny. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  You  know,  we  speak  of  the  Arctic  Wildlife  Ref-
uge, but if the ANWR section is the size of California, the area that 
had been designated for drilling is less than the size of Los Angeles 
city. So, we’re not talking about all of Alaska. 

Admiral  ADMIRAL MCGINN.  Senator,  each  day,  we  consume,  as 
Americans,  about  19.5  million  barrels  of  oil,  an  annual  total  of 
about 7 billion barrels. And, given this rate of consumption, if Arc-
tic  oil  was  our  Nation’s  only  source,  it  would  last  for  6  months. 
There are not sufficient oil reserves, particularly in ANWR, to jus-
tify  any  type  of  a  long-term  policy  resting  on  the  assumption  that 
it  will  be  a  big  part  of  the  solution.  It  could  be,  if  we  were  des-
perate. But I believe there are so many more effective actions that 
we can take with fuel efficiency, energy efficiency, across the board, 
for  every  use  of  liquid  fuel,  that  would  return  so  much  more,  that 
we should put ANWR oil drilling at the very end of the list of avail-
able  options.  There  are  so  many  more  productive  things  that  we 
can do with our time and with our resources. 

The CHAIRMAN. Admiral Blair? 
Admiral BLAIR. Mr. Chairman, we handle lots of very dangerous 
materials in the Armed Forces of the United States every day, and 
the  way  that  we  do  that  is  to  set  up  very  rigid  and  well-controlled

and  -enforced  procedures  in  order  to  make  sure  that  things  that 
are inherently dangerous get done in a safe way. And I believe that 
we  are  to  the  point  where  we  have  to  drill  for  oil  in  places  in  the 
United  States  that  run  risks,  and  we,  therefore,  need  to  put  in 
those sorts of tight controls, tight inspections on them, and that we 
ought to go ahead and do them, including ANWR. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Stanton? 
Mr.  STANTON.  Senator,  as  an  association,  we  have  not  taken  a 
position  on  ANWR,  but  I  think  ANWR  has  been  around  almost  as 
long as CAFE, and is—probably has been just as contentious. I re-
member the votes, back in the—1990s. 

I  think  it  has  taken  on  a  symbolism  that  maybe  it  doesn’t  de-
serve  anymore.  Today,  we  all  testified  about  the  need  to  move  our 
country forward, to decouple us with the climate change issues and 
with  the  energy  security  issues.  I  think  it  ought  to  be  back  on  the 
table, but in a rational way. If we could de-pedestalize it and have 
a  good,  honest  discussion  about  whether  or  not  it’s  necessary,  I 
think that would go a long way. 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. McCurdy? 
Mr. MCCURDY. Mr. Chairman, you have a marvelous way of put-

ting people on the spot. 

Since  I  now  represent  an  association,  our  association,  like  Mike, 
has not taken a position on ANWR. But I think you know, sir, that 
I was a Congressman from an oil state, and so, I probably have less 
reservation  about  types  of  drilling  than  some,  and  I’m  going  to 
leave it at that. 

The CHAIRMAN. Well, I thank all of you. And I hope that we will 
succeed.  As  one  who  represents  the  State  of  Hawaii,  I’m  certain 
you realize that our gas prices are the highest in the Nation. While 
you  were  paying  $2,  we  were  paying  $3,  so  we’ll  reach  $4  before 
you reach $4. 

With  that  in  mind,  I  wish  all  of  you  the  best.  Tomorrow,  we’ll 

have a new bill. 

The meeting is adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 5:45 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Thank  you  Chairman  Inouye  and  Vice  Chairman  Stevens  for  holding  this  impor-
tant  hearing  on  legislation  to  improve  fuel  economy  standards  for  American  vehi-
cles. 

I  want  to  also  thank  the  witnesses  for  appearing  here  today  to  assist  the  Com-

mittee in this effort. 

country, and the world we live in. 

I  believe  we  must  move  forward  quickly  in  this  area  for  our  constituents,  our 

More fuel efficient vehicles can help reduce our dependence on middle Eastern oil, 

decrease emissions, and make our country more secure. 

For these reasons, I look forward to this hearing as it will allow Congress to con-
tinue to make progress in our efforts to get a bill to the President that would make 
a substantial and committed step forward on this issue. 

Throughout  this  process,  I  intend  to  work  in  a  bipartisan  manner  with  my  col-
leagues in the Senate so that we can make measurable progress this year on legisla-
tion  to  improve  fuel  economy  standards  and  reduce  our  dependence  on  petroleum.
