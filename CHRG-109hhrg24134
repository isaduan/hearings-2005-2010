Financial Management at NASA:

Challenges and Next Steps

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On Thursday, October 27, 2005 at 10:00, the Committee on Science, Subcommittee
on  Space  and  Aeronautics  and  the  Committee  on  Government  Reform,  Sub-
committee  on  Government  Management,  Finance  and  Accountability,  will  hold  a
joint  hearing  to  examine  the  difficulties  that  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space
Administration (NASA) faces in managing and reporting on its finances, the effects
these  difficulties  have  on  NASA’s  ability  to  manage  its  programs,  and  NASA’s  cur-
rent and planned efforts to address these challenges.

For several years, NASA has had significant difficulties in managing its financial
operations. Auditors have not been able to sufficiently audit NASA’s financial state-
ments for three of the past four years, citing a lack of documentation and weak con-
trols  over  numerous  processes.  The  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  has
issued reports about NASA’s inability to manage and account for the costs of its pro-
grams.  In  2003,  NASA  replaced  ten  disparate  accounting  systems  with  one  agency-
wide  financial  management  system.  However,  this  system  has  had  numerous  oper-
ational  problems  that  NASA  has  been  trying  to  resolve  since  its  inception.  While
NASA  has  made  some  improvements  to  some  aspects  of  its  financial  management,
it still has numerous, significant problems to overcome.
Overarching Questions

The  Committee  plans  to  explore  the  following  overarching  questions  at  the  hear-

ing:

1. What are the key financial management challenges at NASA? What are their

underlying causes?

2. What  effects  do  these  challenges  have  on  NASA’s  ability  to  manage  its  pro-

grams and its resources?

3. What  progress  has  NASA  made  in  addressing  these  challenges?  What  fur-

ther actions are planned? Are these actions adequate?

Witnesses
Mr. Robert Cobb is the Inspector General of NASA.
Ms. Gwendolyn Sykes is the Chief Financial Officer of NASA.
Mr.  Patrick  Ciganer  is  the  Executive  Officer  for  NASA’s  Integrated  Financial
Management Program.
Mr. Gregory Kutz is the Managing Director of Forensic Audits and Special Inves-
tigations  at  GAO.  Accompanying  Mr.  Kutz  will  be  Mr.  Allen  Li,  Director,  Acquisi-
tion and Sourcing Management.

Issues

The hearing will cover the following issues with regard to NASA’s ability to man-

age its finances:

• Unsatisfactory Audit Results—In three of the past four years, independent
auditors  have  been  unable  to  give  NASA’s  financial  records  a  clean  opinion,
and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has called into question the
reliability of the remaining year’s audit.

• Lack  of  an  Improvement  Plan—While  NASA  originally  disputed  the  find-
ings  of  the  GAO  and  the  Agency’s  independent  auditors,  it  later  accepted  all
of  them  and  agreed  to  implement  each  of  the  recommendations.  In  2004,
NASA  committed  to  developing  a  plan  for  implementing  each  of  the  rec-
ommendations  and  to  providing  the  Office  of  the  Inspector  General  and  the
Science  Committee  with  a  copy  of  the  plan.  However,  NASA  has  yet  to  pro-
vide anything other than an executive summary.

• Problems  Remain  in  NASA’s  New  Financial  Management  System—
NASA  has  purchased  a  complex  system  to  manage  its  finances  and  other  as-
pects of the Agency, such as human resources. In 2003, NASA brought online
the  Core  Financial  module,  bringing  all  ten  NASA  centers  under  a  single  ac-
counting  system  for  the  first  time.  However,  in  2004,  outside  auditors  found
that  the  Core  Financial  module  failed  to  post  certain  transactions  correctly,
did not integrate well with other aspects of the financial management system,
and  did  not  contain  sufficient  controls  to  ensure  that  invalid  data  could  be
detected in a timely fashion. NASA is hoping that a major upgrade of its Core
Financial  module,  which  it  plans  to  implement  in  fiscal  year  2006,  will  help
resolve  many  of  these  issues.  Until  then,  NASA  will  not  will  not  be  able  to
comply  fully  with  the  Federal  Financial  Management  Improvement  Act.  GAO
has faulted NASA for rushing to implement the Core Financial module before
it  had  developed  an  overall  plan,  or  architecture,  for  the  entire  multi-module
system.  GAO  has  issued  four  reports  identifying  weaknesses  in  NASA’s  ap-
proach  to  implementing  its  financial  management  system  and  containing  45
recommendations to the Agency to correct these problems. At today’s hearing,
GAO is releasing a new report finding that NASA has fully implemented only
three of these recommendations and partially implemented another 13.

• Inability to Reconcile NASA’s Balance with Treasury—In 2003, NASA’s
independent  auditors  found  that  the  Agency  could  not  reconcile  a  net  dif-
ference of $1.7 billion between its financial records and NASA’s balance in the
U.S.  Treasury.  But  the 
‘‘gross’’  value,  or  the  absolute  value  of  each
unreconciled  transaction  added  up  to  $8.6  billion,  according  to  the  auditors.
As of March 2005, NASA’s Inspector General determined that the Agency had
successfully reconciled all but $144 million of the net difference, but that the
absolute value of the unreconciled transactions continued to exceed $7 billion.
In  September,  NASA’s  Chief  Financial  Officer  (CFO)  provided  each  NASA
Center guidelines for writing off portions of the remaining unreconciled trans-
actions.  According  to  NASA,  its  balance  now  agrees  with  the  Treasury  after
Centers  wrote  off  a  total  of  $14  million  in  unreconcilable  transactions.  How-
ever  it  is  unclear  what  the  absolute  value  is  of  these  transactions  adds  up
to.

• Weak Internal Controls Remain—NASA’s  independent  auditors  have  said
repeatedly  that  NASA  needs  to  strengthen  its  internal  controls—the  policies
and practices intended to provide reasonable assurance about the accuracy of
its  financial  information—especially  given  weaknesses  in  the  Agency’s  Core
Financial  module.  Such  controls  help  an  agency  ensure  that  its  employees  or
contractors  are  not  abusing  their  purchasing  authority  or  otherwise  commit-
ting fraud. NASA’s Office of the Inspector General said that NASA still must
make  substantial  adjustments  to  its  quarterly  financial  statements  produced
by the Core Financial module and that the Agency continues to fail to provide
sufficient  documentation  for  financial  data  to  ensure  its  reliability.  Under
such  conditions,  according  to  the  Office  of  Inspector  General,  NASA  is  less
likely to detect waste, fraud, or abuse.

• Contract  Management  at  High  Risk  for  Waste,  Fraud,  and  Abuse—
Since  1990,  GAO  has  consistently  identified  NASA’s  contract  management
practices  as  vulnerable  to  waste,  fraud,  and  abuse,  primarily  due  to  NASA’s
lack  of  a  modern  financial  system  that  can  provide  reliable  information  on
contract  spending  and  performance.  NASA  has  been  developing  a  Contract
Management  software  package,  but  according  to  the  Office  of  Inspector  Gen-
eral, that software lacks the financial capabilities necessary to help the Agen-
cy address GAO’s concerns. NASA plans to upgrade its Contract Management
software at some later date to provide the necessary financial data.

• Inability to Account for Physical Property—NASA reports that the value
of  its  physical  assets,  including  rockets,  satellites  and  other  hardware,  totals
more than $38 billion. However, NASA relies heavily on its contractors to ac-
curately  report  the  value  of  these  assets  to  the  Agency,  a  serious  weakness
according  to  NASA’s  independent  auditors.  While  the  auditors  have  noted
some  recent  improvements,  NASA’s  Office  of  Inspector  General  noted  that
NASA cannot hope to receive a clean audit opinion until this issue is resolved.

Overview

Agencies need accurate, timely financial information to know how much their ac-
tivities cost and to estimate their future costs. They also need effective controls over
their  operations  that  are  designed  to  prevent  or  detect  the  occurrence  of  fraud,
waste, or abuse of taxpayers’ dollars. Moreover, Congress needs reliable financial in-
formation from agencies in order to carry out effective oversight of their operations.
Over  the  past  several  years,  auditors  have  repeatedly  reported  on  NASA’s  weak
financial management and unreliable financial data. In three of the past four years,
independent  auditors  reported  that  they  were  unable  to  express  an  opinion  on
NASA’s  financial  statements.  For  example,  for  fiscal  year  2003,  NASA  made  $565
billion in adjustments—more than 37 times its total budget for that year—to correct
errors and make other changes to its accounting records. The auditors could not find
adequate  documentation  to  support  these  adjustments.  For  fiscal  year  2002,  NASA
received  an  unqualified1 or  ‘‘clean’’  audit  opinion  on  its  financial  statements.  How-
ever,  a  subsequent  review  by  the  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  called
into  question  the  reliability  of  that  audit.  The  following  table  summarizes  NASA’s
financial audit results for the past five years.

NASA’s  lack  of  reliable  financial  information  can  affect  its  ability  to  accurately
track funds, manage the costs of its programs, and develop accurate cost estimates.
For example, as a result of cost growth on the International Space Station in 2000,
Congress  legislated  a  cost  cap  for  the  program  and  directed  GAO  to  verify  that
NASA  was  accurately  accounting  for  all  costs  associated  with  the  program.  From
2001 through 2005, GAO repeatedly tried to determine if NASA was complying with
the  Congressional  limits.  However,  because  of  poor  record-keeping,  NASA  has  been
unable  to  provide  GAO  adequate  information  on  how  much  money  had  been  obli-
gated for the Station.

NASA’s new Administrator, Dr. Michael Griffin, has expressed his intent to make
improvement  of  NASA’s  financial  management  a  priority.  In  his  testimony  before
the Committee on Science in June of this year, he called the status of NASA’s finan-
cial  management  ‘‘deplorable.’’  He  also  said  that  it  was  unacceptable  for  NASA  to
be  unable  to  meet  the  same  financial  standards  to  which  it  holds  its  contractors.
NASA’s  financial  management  weaknesses  can  be  attributed  primarily  to  two
overarching conditions: the lack of an integrated financial management system and
the lack of sufficient internal control policies and procedures. In the past few years,

1 An  unqualified  opinion  means  that  the  financial  statements  fairly  present  an  organization’s
financial  position  and  results  of  operations  in  conformance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

NASA  has  been  working  to  address  both  of  these  issues  and  has  made  some
progress, although much is left to do.

During fiscal year 2003, NASA implemented a new finance and accounting system
throughout  the  entire  Agency.  However,  this  system  is  not  fully  integrated  with
other  financial-related  systems,  such  as  property  management  systems,  and  is  not
fully  functioning  as  intended.  GAO  issued  a  series  of  reports  in  2003  about  weak-
nesses  in  NASA’s  implementation  of  the  system.  At  this  hearing,  GAO  is  releasing
a follow-up report about the status of its recommendations from the earlier reports.
In  September  2004,  NASA  published  a  new  set  of  NASA  Financial  Management
Requirements  as  well  as  supplemental  policy  guidance  for  a  number  of  issues.  In
addition, NASA has continued to make other changes in its financial operations dur-
ing  fiscal  year  2005.  For  example,  it  began  requiring  the  Chief  Financial  Officers
(CFOs)  at  each  of  its  ten  field  Centers  to  report  directly  to  the  NASA  CFO,  rather
than  to  Center  Directors,  to  help  ensure  that  all  Centers  follow  the  same  proce-
dures.  However,  the  Centers  are  somewhat  resistant  to  change  and  have  continued
to  follow  some  of  their  own  procedures  and  use  some  of  their  own  systems  for  spe-
cific  purposes,  despite  the  CFO’s  efforts  to  standardize  all  procedures  throughout
the  Agency.  The  impact  that  NASA’s  various  new  policies  and  procedures  have  on
control  over  its  financial  operations  cannot  yet  be  determined,  but  should  become
more  evident  as  the  results  of  NASA’s  financial  audit  for  fiscal  year  2005  are  re-
leased.
Financial Management System Issues

Until  2003,  each  of  NASA’s  ten  Centers  and  NASA  Headquarters  had  their  own
separate  accounting  systems  that  were  operated  independently  and  were  incompat-
ible with each other. As a result, NASA did not have the ability to accumulate agen-
cy-wide  financial  data  on  a  routine,  systematic  basis.  Instead,  it  obtained  NASA-
wide data only through periodic data calls. NASA had made two attempts to develop
an  agency-wide  system  in  the  past—once  in  the  late  1980s  and  again  in  the  late
1990s—but  both  efforts  were  eventually  abandoned.  Because  of  its  lack  of  an  agen-
cy-wide system, NASA has not been in compliance with the Federal Financial Man-
agement Improvement Act (FFMIA) of 1996, which requires federal agencies to have
integrated financial management systems that comply with specific federal require-
ments.

In  2000,  NASA  began  its  third  attempt  to  modernize  its  financial  management
systems  and  processes  as  it  began  developing  an  integrated  financial  management
system, now called the Integrated Enterprise Management Program or IEMP.3 This
system  was  initially  planned  to  consist  of  nine  modules  that  would  support  a  wide
range  of  business  activities,  including  asset  management,  accounting  and  financial
operations,  and  human  capital  management.  As  IEMP  has  progressed,  NASA  has
changed  some  of  its  plans  and  has  encountered  significant  problems  in  developing
some  of  the  modules,  as  explained  further  below.  NASA  initially  planned  to  com-
plete IEMP in fiscal year 2008 with an estimated life-cycle cost of almost $1 billion.
NASA  has  stated  that  it  still  intends  to  complete  development  of  IEMP  by  the  end
of 2008. However, it is unclear how NASA will meet this deadline after recently de-
ciding to delay development of one module—the Integrated Asset Management mod-
ule—until NASA changes its asset management procedures.

Except  for  the  Core  Financial  module,  the  IEMP  modules  that  have  been  imple-
mented so far tend to be the less complex modules. The following table summarizes
the status of IEMP’s modules as currently defined.

3 NASA recently renamed the system IEMP. Previously, it was called the Integrated Financial

Management Program (IFMP).

Core Financial Module

During fiscal year 2003, NASA implemented the most significant module of IEMP,
the  Core  Financial  module,  which  performs  most  of  the  Agency’s  accounting  and  fi-
nancial  functions.  The  Core  Financial  module  uses  enterprise  resource  planning
(ERP)4 software  from  SAP,  a  large  German  company  and  one  of  only  a  handful  of
companies  that  make  ERP  software.  SAP’s  software  is  used  by  many  Fortune  500
companies  and  by  other  federal  agencies,  including  the  Department  of  Defense  and
Customs  and  Border  Patrol.  NASA  hired  the  consulting  firm  Accenture  to  develop
and implement the module using SAP’s software.

With the implementation of the Core Financial module, all ten NASA Centers and
Headquarters  began  using  one  accounting  system  for  the  first  time  in  NASA’s  his-
tory. However, the operation of the module has experienced problems since its incep-
tion. In their report on NASA’s fiscal year 2004 financial statements, NASA’s finan-
cial auditors stated that the Core Financial module:

• does not post certain transactions correctly,
• does not provide some information needed to support financial statements,
• is not integrated with certain subsidiary systems, and
• does  not  contain  sufficient  controls  to  detect  and  correct  invalid  data  in  a

timely fashion.

These  problems  have  occurred  largely  because  NASA  did  not  follow  appropriate
procedures  for  developing  and  implementing  a  complex  system  such  as  IEMP,  and
the  core  financial  module  in  particular.  GAO  identified  a  number  of  weaknesses  in
the procedures that NASA followed, which are described further below.

Because of these weaknesses, NASA is still not in compliance with Federal Finan-
cial  Management  Improvement  Act  (FFMIA).  NASA  has  been  striving  to  stabilize
and  improve  the  operations  of  the  Core  Financial  module  since  its  implementation.
It is now planning to install a major software upgrade for this module in fiscal year
2006, using a new version of SAP software, which it expects to significantly improve
the module’s performance and reliability.
Other IEMP Modules

NASA  has  had  some  difficulties  in  developing  other  modules  of  IEMP  as  well.
During  fiscal  year  2004,  it  almost  completed  development  and  implementation  of  a
Budget  Formulation  module  at  a  reported  cost  of  $29  million.  This  module  was  ex-
pected to significantly improve and streamline NASA’s process for developing its an-
nual  budget.  However,  in  late  2004,  NASA  changed  its  budget  structure.  Because

4 ERP  software  consists  of  multiple,  integrated  modules  designed  to  perform  all  business-re-
lated  functions  of  an  organization,  such  as  planning,  inventory  control,  finance,  and  human  re-
source management.

8

the  Budget  Formulation  module  was  based  on  the  old  budget  structure,  NASA
shelved the module and decided to revise its old budget system for use with the new
budget structure.

NASA had also recently begun the early stages of developing an Integrated Asset
Management  module  which  would  maintain  information  on  all  of  NASA’s  physical
assets and automatically provide relevant information to the Core Financial module.
However, during fiscal year 2005, NASA put this project on hold for two years until
it revises its procedures for managing its physical assets.
GAO Recommendations on IEMP

In  2003,  GAO  issued  four  reports  that  identified  weaknesses  in  NASA’s  strategy
for  developing  and  implementing  IEMP.  These  weaknesses  included  the  processes
that NASA followed to acquire system software, the identification, management, and
testing  of  system  specifications,  and  IEMP  cost  control.  In  its  reports,  GAO  ex-
pressed  concern  about  the  impact  these  weaknesses  could  ultimately  have  on  the
system’s performance.

Another major weakness identified by GAO was NASA’s lack of an enterprise ar-
chitecture to guide the development and implementation of IEMP. An enterprise ar-
chitecture  is  an  organizational  blueprint  that  defines—in  both  business  and  tech-
nology terms—how an organization operates today, how it intends to operate in the
future, and how it will transition to the future state. The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996
requires agencies to develop, maintain, and implement such architectures for use in
managing the integration of their business processes and systems.

To  help  correct  the  identified  weaknesses  in  IEMP,  GAO  made  a  total  of  45  rec-
ommendations  to  NASA.  GAO  recently  completed  a  follow-up  review  to  determine
the  extent  to  which  NASA  has  addressed  its  recommendations.  At  this  hearing,
GAO  will  be  releasing  a  report  that  discusses  the  results  of  its  review  and  the  sta-
tus of NASA’s efforts to address its recommendations. GAO found that NASA’s over-
all  progress  has  been  slow,  particularly  with  respect  to  establishing  an  enterprise
architecture,  but  it  has  made  some  progress  in  other  areas  such  as  enhancing  the
Core  Financial  module’s  ability  to  provide  project  management  information.  Of
GAO’s  45  recommendations,  the  report  indicates  that  NASA  has  fully  implemented
three  recommendations  and  has  partially  implemented  another  13  recommenda-
tions. A summary of the status of GAO’s recommendations is provided in Appendix
A.
Internal Control Issues

An integrated financial management system can only function as well as an agen-
cy’s underlying policies and procedures. Those policies and procedures that help en-
sure the accuracy and timeliness of financial data are called internal controls. Fed-
eral  agencies  are  required  to  have  internal  controls  in  place  to  provide  reasonable
assurance  that  transactions  are  processed  and  recorded  properly,  that  financial  re-
ports are reliable, and that the Agency complies with all applicable laws and regula-
tions. Internal controls should also provide reasonable assurance regarding the pre-
vention or prompt detection of any fraud, waste, or abuse.

Because  of  the  weaknesses  in  the  Core  Financial  module  and  in  various  NASA
processes, NASA’s independent auditors pointed out the need for additional controls
to ensure that transactions are recorded accurately and that any errors are detected
and  corrected  in  a  timely  manner.  The  auditors  noted  that  internal  control  weak-
nesses included the Core Financial module’s inability to track non-routine or correc-
tion  entries,  the  lack  of  formalized  policies  and  procedures  for  certain  processes,
such as the development of financial statements, and a lack of adequate documenta-
tion  to  support  certain  transactions.  The  auditors  made  a  number  of  recommenda-
tions to improve controls, such as enhanced reconciliation and analytical procedures.
They  also  noted  that  as  of  September  2004,  NASA  had  developed  revised  policies
and procedures to address several of the noted weaknesses. However, because these
new  policies  and  procedures  were  not  in  place  until  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  the
auditors could not assess their effectiveness.

The following sections address specific internal control issues.

Fund Balance with Treasury

An  agency’s  Fund  Balance  with  Treasury  account  is  similar  to  a  bank  account  in
that  it  represents  money  that  the  Agency  can  spend  for  authorized  transactions.  A
key control in ensuring that an agency’s transactions are accurately recorded is the
reconciliation  of  its  Fund  Balance  with  Treasury  account  with  the  U.S.  Treasury’s
records.

For  fiscal  year  2003,  NASA’s  auditors  found  that  NASA  could  not  reconcile  the
difference  between  its  Fund  Balance  account  and  the  Treasury’s  records.  The  bal-
ance in NASA’s Fund Balance account exceeded Treasury’s records by a net amount

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

9

of  $1.7  billion.  However,  the  absolute  value  of  the  differences  for  the  individual
transactions comprising the unreconciled amount was $8.6 billion. NASA attributed
much  of  the  unreconciled  amount  to  difficulties  in  converting  the  data  to  the  new
Core  Financial  module,  although  it  has  not  yet  analyzed  all  transactions  or  deter-
mined how many transactions comprise this difference.

During fiscal years 2004 and 2005, NASA worked on analyzing and resolving the
Fund  Balance  difference  from  fiscal  year  2003.  NASA’s  Office  of  Inspector  General
reviewed  NASA’s  efforts  to  reconcile  its  Fund  Balance  account  and  in  March  2005,
reported  that  NASA’s  efforts  had  resolved  $1.6  billion  of  the  net  difference,  leaving
a  remaining  unreconciled  net  difference  of  $144  million.  However,  the  Office  of  In-
spector General also pointed out that the absolute value of unreconciled differences
for individual transactions was still over $7 billion.

Although it did not resolve all differences for the individual transactions from fis-
cal  year  2003,  NASA  reported  that  its  Fund  Balance  account  balance  agreed  with
the  Treasury’s  balance  as  of  September  30,  2005.  To  make  the  balances  agree,
NASA  increased  its  Fund  Balance  account  by  $14  million  to  eliminate  a  difference
that  could  not  be  traced  to  specific  transactions.  NASA  also  said  that  it  had  devel-
oped  new  procedures  to  avoid  unreconcilable  differences  in  the  Fund  Balance  ac-
count in the future. It developed its own software program that compares the Fund
Balance  account  balances  for  each  NASA  Center  with  the  Treasury’s  balances  on  a
monthly basis. The Centers are expected to resolve any differences each month and
certify  their  results  to  the  NASA  CFO.  Because  these  procedures  are  new,  it  is  too
early to know if they are effective.
Physical Assets

NASA reported the value of its Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) and Ma-
terials to be almost $38 billion in fiscal year 2004. For several years, NASA’s audi-
tors have reported that the Agency has serious weaknesses in internal controls over
these assets, primarily because of NASA’s heavy reliance on its contractors to accu-
rately  report  costs  to  the  Agency.  In  2004,  about  $8.5  billion  of  NASA’s  PP&E  was
held  by  contractors.  Contractor-held  assets  include  everything  from  office  supplies
to  rockets  and  buildings.  Rather  than  maintaining  its  own  records  of  these  assets,
NASA relies on quarterly or monthly reporting by the contractors. While NASA pe-
riodically  reviews  the  contractors’  controls  over  the  reporting  of  these  assets,
NASA’s auditors have found these procedures to be insufficient in the past.

NASA  also  relies  on  contractors  to  report  the  costs  of  developing  or  building  its
numerous large, complex assets such rockets, satellites, and exploration equipment.
When such assets are completed and turned over to NASA, NASA has no systematic
process to ensure that the assets are properly recorded in its records. Instead, it re-
lies  on  periodic  data  calls  to  ensure  that  all  assets  are  identified,  and  on  property
managers to record the cost of the asset based on their review of certain accounting
codes  within  the  Core  Financial  module.  This  process  does  not  provide  a  means  to
ensure that all costs for NASA’s assets are recorded.

In  fiscal  year  2004,  NASA  took  some  steps  to  improve  controls  over  its  assets.  It
developed a quality assurance program in which it uses services of the Defense Con-
tract Audit Agency to review policies and procedures and to test transactions at its
most significant contractors. It also increased the required frequency of reporting by
contractors. Its auditors reported that they had noted some improvement as a result
of  these  efforts.  In  addition,  NASA  recently  established  a  team  to  work  on  devel-
oping new procedures for controlling and recording the costs of property.
Contract Management

Since 1990, GAO has identified NASA’s contract management as a high-risk area
because  of  vulnerabilities  to  waste,  fraud,  and  abuse.  GAO  attributes  these
vulnerabilities primarily to NASA’s lack of a modern financial system that can pro-
vide  reliable  information  on  contract  spending  and  performance.  Also,  GAO  found
that  NASA  lacked  data  analysis  tools  and  adequately  trained  staff  to  perform  cost
analyses,  including  a  contract  management  method  called  ‘‘earned  value  manage-
ment.’’

Although NASA obtains detailed cost and performance information for some of its
larger  contracts,  this  information  is  not  recorded  in  the  Core  Financial  module  be-
cause  the  module’s  accounting  code  structure,  which  was  carried  over  from  NASA’s
legacy  accounting  systems,  is  not  designed  to  handle  this  level  of  detailed  informa-
tion.  However,  detailed  cost  information  is  needed  by  both  program  managers  and
cost  estimators.  To  improve  the  Core  Financial  module’s  ability  to  maintain  de-
tailed,  useful  cost  information,  NASA  has  a  project  underway,  called  Project  Man-
agement  Information  Improvement  (PMI2),  to  align  its  accounting  code  structure
with  its  technical  work  breakdown  structure.  NASA  reported  that  it  completed  the

first phase of this effort this month. In addition to providing better cost information,
NASA  expects  this  new  structure  to  also  improve  its  ability  to  account  for  assets.
Environmental Liability

In  their  annual  financial  statements,  agencies  are  required  to  report  the  esti-
mated amount of liability they have incurred for environmental cleanup as a result
of  their  activities.  For  fiscal  year  2004,  NASA  reported  this  liability  to  be  almost
$1  billion.  However,  its  financial  auditors  reported  that  NASA  lacked  sufficient,
auditable  evidence  for  this  estimate.  They  also  noted  that  the  personnel  who  pre-
pared  the  estimate  had  inadequate  training  and  guidance  to  follow,  and  NASA
lacked quality control procedures to ensure the accuracy of the estimate.
OMB Circular A–123

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recently revised its Circular A–123,
Management’s  Responsibility  for  Internal  Control,  to  strengthen  agency  manage-
ment’s  responsibility  for  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  The  revised  Cir-
cular, which became effective this month with the start of fiscal year 2006, contains
provisions  similar  to  those  in  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  for  publicly  traded
companies.  Previously,  Circular  A-123  required  management  to  assess  and  report
annually on overall internal controls within an agency, including a corrective action
plan  for  any  known  weaknesses.  The  newly  revised  Circular  now  requires,  in  addi-
tion to previous requirements, that management provide a separate assurance state-
ment on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. To provide this
assurance statement, agencies are required to document their controls over financial
reporting,  follow  specific  procedures  for  assessing  these  controls,  and  document
these assessment procedures.

In preparation for complying with the revised Circular, NASA submitted a Finan-
cial  Management  Internal  Control  Plan  to  OMB  in  August  2005.  The  plan  outlines
steps  NASA  has  already  taken  as  well  as  steps  it  plans  to  take  to  meet  the  new
requirements of the Circular. OMB’s opinion of this plan is not known.

Glossary

Disclaimer of opinion—when auditors are unable to determine the reliability
of  financial  statements.  This  situation  can  occur  if  an  organization  has  signifi-
cant weaknesses in its internal controls or if the auditors are unable to perform
sufficient audit work.
Qualified  opinion—when  auditors  find  one  or  more  items  in  the  financial
statements  that  do  not  conform  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.
However,  the  auditors  do  not  believe  that  these  items  are  so  significant  as  to
invalidate the financial statements taken as a whole.
Unqualified  opinion—when  auditors  believe  the  financial  statements  fairly
present an organization’s financial position and results of operations in conform-
ance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Enterprise  architecture—an  organizational  blueprint  that  defines—in  both  busi-
ness  and  technology  terms—how  an  organization  operates  today,  how  it  intends  to
operate in the future, and how it will transition to the future state.
Enterprise Resource Planning or ERP—a type of software that consists of mul-
tiple, integrated modules designed to perform all business-related functions of an or-
ganization,  such  as  planning,  inventory  control,  finance,  and  human  resource  man-
agement.
Material weakness—a reportable condition in which the design or operation of one
or  more  internal  controls  does  not,  in  the  auditor’s  opinion,  provide  reasonable  as-
surance  that  any  significant  misstatements  in  amounts  would  occur  and  not  be  de-
tected in a timely manner by employees carrying out their normal functions.
Reportable condition—when  a  significant  deficiency  exists  in  the  design  or  oper-
ation  of  an  internal  control  that,  in  the  auditor’s  judgment,  could  adversely  affect
an agency’s ability to record and report financial data in compliance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Good  morning.  This  morning  I  want  to  wel-
come Congressman Todd Platts, Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Government  Management,  Finance,  and  Accountability  of  the
House  Committee  on  Government  Reform,  as  we  co-chair  this  im-
portant  joint  hearing  on  NASA’s  financial  management  system.  I
want  to  also  welcome  my  friend  and  Ranking  Democrat  Mark
Udall,  and  I  am  not  sure,  but  Ranking  Democrat  Edolphus  Towns
of  the  Subcommittee  on  Government  Management,  Finance,  and
Accountability may be with us shortly.

As  you  know,  I  am  a  strong  supporter  of  NASA.  I  want  NASA
to  be  successful.  However,  as  a  businessman,  I  also  know  that
without  sound  financial  management,  NASA  will  not  be  able  to
achieve the goals set for its programs. Sound financial management
is an integral part of good management of any organization. I have
met with Ms. Sykes and Mr. Ciganer and know that they are work-
ing  very  hard  to  fix  the  problems  with  NASA’s  financial  manage-
ment operations.

The  Government  Accountability  Office  will  be  releasing  a  report
at  this  hearing  today  that  summarizes  NASA’s  progress  in  imple-
menting  the  recommendations  made  by  GAO  over  the  last  two
years.  The  GAO  found  that  NASA  has  closed  out  only  three  of  the
45  recommendations,  and  13  of  the  recommendations  have  been
partially  implemented.  This  leaves  29  recommendations  that  are
still  open.  While  NASA  has  made  some  progress,  clearly,  there  is
a long way to go.

When  I  met  with  Ms.  Sykes  and  Mr.  Ciganer,  they  told  me  that
they have made some important improvements to NASA’s financial
management  system:  monthly  statements  are  now  more  timely  for
the programs and centers, although there are certain concerns over
the accuracy of these statements; NASA has improved controls over
its  assets;  and,  the  financial  management  teams  at  NASA  centers
now report to the Agency CFO, Ms. Sykes. Although there are defi-
nitely many financial management problems ahead for NASA, I am
hopeful that the Agency may be turning the corner in a more posi-
tive  direction  as  it  wrestles  with  these  very  difficult  but  critical  fi-
nancial management challenges.

I am concerned that in three of the past four years, independent
auditors have been unable to give NASA’s financial records a pass-
ing  grade.  Administrator  Griffin,  when  he  testified  before  the
Science  Committee  in  June,  characterized  the  status  of  NASA’s  fi-
nancial management as ‘‘deplorable.’’ Not only is financial manage-
ment  critical  to  successful  operation  of  the  Agency,  but  we  in  the
Congress  also  need  reliable  financial  information  in  order  to  carry
out effective oversight. We don’t want to risk the future of NASA’s
new programs and ventures by having them built on a shaky finan-
cial infrastructure. I want to see this great nation lead in the areas
of  exploration,  aeronautics,  and  the  sciences,  and  I  don’t  want  us
to risk this leadership with unstable underpinnings in the Agency’s
financial system.

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today as they iden-
tify the problems that NASA is facing, as well as offer solutions so
that NASA can address these challenges and manage its important
programs successfully.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN KEN CALVERT

This morning, I want to welcome Congressman Todd Platts, Chairman of the Sub-
committee  on  Government  Management,  Finance,  and  Accountability  of  the  House
Committee  on  Government  Reform,  as  we  co-chair  this  important  joint  hearing  on
NASA’s  Financial  Management  system.  I  also  want  to  welcome  my  Ranking  Demo-
crat  Mark  Udall  and  Ranking  Democrat  Edolphus  Towns,  of  the  same  Sub-
committee on Government Management, Finance and Accountability.

As  you  know,  I  am  a  strong  supporter  of  NASA.  I  want  NASA  to  be  successful.
However, as a businessman, I also know that without sound financial management,
NASA  will  not  be  able  to  achieve  the  goals  set  for  its  programs.  Sound  financial
management  is  an  integral  part  of  good  management  within  any  organization.  I
have  met  with  Ms.  Sykes  and  Mr.  Ciganer  and  know  that  they  are  working  very
hard to fix the problems with NASA’s financial management operations.

The  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  will  be  releasing  a  report  at  this
hearing today that summarizes NASA’s progress in implementing the recommenda-
tions  made  by  GAO  over  the  last  two  years.  The  GAO  found  that  NASA  has  closed
out only three of the 45 recommendations and 13 of the recommendations have only
been  partially  implemented.  This  leaves  29  recommendations  that  are  still  open.
While NASA has made some progress, clearly there’s a long way to go.

When  I  met  with  Ms.  Sykes  and  Mr.  Ciganer,  they  told  me  that  there  have  been
some  improvements  to  NASA’s  financial  management  system:  monthly  statements
are now more timely for the programs and centers, although there are concerns over
the accuracy of these statements; NASA has improved controls over its assets; and,
the  financial  management  teams  at  the  NASA  centers  now  report  to  the  Agency
CFO,  Ms.  Sykes.  Although  there  are  definitely  many  financial  management  prob-
lems  ahead  for  NASA,  I  am  hopeful  that  the  Agency  may  be  turning  the  corner  in
a  more  positive  direction  as  it  wrestles  with  these  very  difficult,  but  critical,  finan-
cial management challenges.

I  am  concerned  that  in  three  of  the  past  four  years,  independent  auditors  have
been unable to give NASA’s financial records a passing grade. Administrator Griffin,
when  he  testified  before  the  Science  Committee  in  June,  characterized  the  status
of NASA’s financial management as ‘‘deplorable.’’ Not only is financial management
critical to successful operation of the Agency, but we in the Congress also need reli-
able  financial  information  in  order  to  carry  out  effective  oversight.  We  don’t  want
to  risk  the  future  of  NASA’s  new  programs  and  ventures,  by  having  them  built  on
a  shaky  financial  infrastructure.  I  want  to  see  this  great  nation  lead  in  the  areas
of  exploration,  aeronautics  and  the  sciences,  and  don’t  want  us  to  risk  this  leader-
ship  with  unstable  underpinnings  in  the  Agency’s  financial  system.  I  look  forward
to hearing from our witnesses today as they identify the problems that NASA is fac-
ing, as well as offer solutions so that NASA can address these challenges and man-
age its important programs successfully.

Chairman  CALVERT.  With  that,  I  would  like  to  recognize  Mr.

Platts for his opening.

Mr.  PLATTS.  Chairman  Calvert,  thank  you  for  convening  this
hearing today and for your clear interest in important management
issues  at  NASA.  Please  also  know  that  I  share  your  support  for
NASA  and  its  very  important  mission  to  our  nation,  our  citizens,
and, really, all of humanity.

As you are aware, my Subcommittee looked at the topic of finan-
cial  management  at  NASA  last  year,  and  this  remains  a  top  pri-
ority. We have a responsibility to the taxpayers to ensure account-
ability,  especially  during  times  of  heightened  fiscal  responsibility
and tightening budgets.

In  order  to  support  America’s  space  program,  Congress  and  the
public  needs  credible,  reliable  financial  data  to  support  the  deci-
sions we make, and NASA must demonstrate effective stewardship
over the taxpayers we entrust to them. Management issues cannot
be overlooked in the context of the broader policies that will shape
NASA’s future, and I commend you, Mr. Chairman, for recognizing
this  important  fact.  Without  sound  management  and  account-

ability, even the most forward-looking and innovative programs are
unlikely to be successful.

Financial  management  at  NASA  has  produced  mixed  results,
from  clean  opinions  in  the  1990s  to  disclaimers  in  the  past  few
years.  Clearly,  this  needs  to  be  addressed,  and  the  efforts  under-
way to modernize NASA’s financial systems through the Integrated
Enterprise  Management  program  are  the  key  to  success,  whether
it  be  in  data  conversion  problems,  it  is  the  IEMP,  combined  with
the  strong  commitment  from  NASA’s  leadership,  that  will  eventu-
ally put NASA back on track.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  welcome  the  opportunity  provided  by  this  joint
hearing  to  work  closely  with  your  staff  to  ensure  that  NASA  has
the tools in place to succeed.

And  I  certainly  thank  each  of  our  witnesses  who  are  here  with
us today for the written testimony that they have provided and for
their  statements  that  they  are  about  to  provide  to  us  here  in  this
hearing.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Udall.
Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Good  morning  to  the

panel.

In  addition,  I  want  to  welcome  Chairman  Platts  and  Ranking
Member  Towns  and  the  rest  of  your  Subcommittee  to  the  hearing.
The topic of today’s hearing, the status of NASA’s financial man-
agement  system  is  an  important  one,  as  we  have  already  heard
from  the  two  distinguished  Chairmen  here.  I  am  pleased  that  our
two subcommittees are working together to determine what kind of
job  NASA  is  doing  on  financial  management  and  what  the  Agency
needs to do to improve its performance.

This challenge was put starkly in a September 9 letter to Chair-
man  Boehlert  and  Ranking  Member  Gordon  that  accompanied  the
GAO report on this topic that is being released today.

If I might, I want to quote the GAO: ‘‘As we and others have re-
ported in the past, the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion  has  fundamental  problems  with  its  financial  management  op-
erations that undermine its external financial reporting ability and
thwart  its  efforts  to  effectively  manage  and  oversee  its  major  pro-
grams.’’

That is a sobering assessment.
In  addition,  the  NASA  Inspector  General  will  testify  today  that
NASA’s  financial  statements  will  again  fail  to  receive  a  passing
grade  from  NASA’s  independent  auditors,  with  the  auditors  citing,
to quote the IG, ‘‘instances of noncompliance with generally accept-
ed accounting principles, reportable conditions in internal controls,
and  noncompliance  with  the  Federal  Financial  Management  Im-
provement  Act  and  the  Improper  Payments  Information  Act  of
2002.’’

Equally  troubling,  the  IG  will  testify  that:  ‘‘The  Agency  has  not
been  able  to  articulate  with  clarity  comprehensive  action  plans  for
how  it  will  address  its  internal  control  weaknesses  or  its  financial
management problems.’’

Now to be fair, NASA has a tough challenge in trying to develop
an integrated financial management system for an agency that has

17

had a large number of independent ‘‘legacy’’ systems at its centers.
And  both  the  IG  and  the  GAO  will  testify  that  NASA  has  made
some progress over the past several years.

Yet,  they  both  indicate  that  NASA  has  a  very  long  road  ahead
of it, with success not yet assured. I hope today’s hearing will shed
some light on the challenges that NASA is going to have to address
as  well  as  help  identify  the  most  promising  approaches  for  NASA
to take.

That  said,  Mr.  Chairman,  again,  I  want  to  welcome  the  wit-

nesses, and I look forward to your testimony.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Udall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MARK UDALL

Good morning. I want to welcome the witnesses to today’s hearing.
In addition, I want to welcome Chairman Platts and Ranking Member Towns and
the  other  Members  of  the  Government  Management,  Finance,  and  Accountability
Subcommittee to our hearing room.

The  topic  of  today’s  hearing—the  status  of  NASA’s  financial  management  sys-
tem—is an important one. And I’m pleased that our two subcommittees are working
together  to  determine  what  kind  of  job  NASA  is  doing  on  financial  management,
and what the Agency needs to do to improve its performance.

The  challenge  facing  NASA  was  put  starkly  in  a  September  9th  letter  to  Chair-
man  Boehlert  and  Ranking  Member  Gordon  that  accompanied  the  GAO  report  on
this topic that is being released today.

To  quote  GAO:  ‘‘As  we  and  others  have  reported  in  the  past,  the  National  Aero-
nautics and Space Administration (NASA) has fundamental problems with its finan-
cial  management  operations  that  undermine  its  external  financial  reporting  ability
and thwart its efforts to effectively manage and oversee its major programs.’’

That is a very sobering assessment.
In  addition,  the  NASA  Inspector  General  will  testify  today  that  NASA  financial
statements will again fail to receive a passing grade from NASA’s independent audi-
tors, with the auditors citing [to quote the IG] ‘‘instances of noncompliance with gen-
erally accepted accounting principles, reportable conditions (with most being material
weaknesses)  in  internal  controls,  and  noncompliance  with  the  Federal  Financial
Management  Improvement  Act  and  the  Improper  Payments  Information  Act  of
2002.’’

Equally troubling, the IG will testify that: ‘‘The Agency has not been able to articu-
late with clarity comprehensive action plans for how it will address its internal con-
trol weaknesses or its financial management problems.’’

In fairness, NASA has a tough challenge in trying to develop an integrated finan-
cial management system for an agency that has had a large number of independent
‘‘legacy’’  systems  at  its  Centers.  And  both  the  IG  and  the  GAO  will  testify  that
NASA has made some progress over the past several years.

Yet, they also both indicate that NASA has a very long road ahead of it, with suc-
cess  not  yet  assured.  I  hope  today’s  hearing  will  shed  some  light  on  the  challenges
that NASA is going to have to address, as well as help identify the most promising
approaches for NASA to take.

That said, I again want to welcome our witnesses, and I look forward to your tes-

timony.

Thank you and I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Towns follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE ED TOWNS

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  holding  today’s  hearing  on  the  state  of  financial
management  at  NASA.  As  a  supporter  of  NASA’s  core  mission  of  space  exploration
and  its  efforts  that  enable  us  to  further  understand  the  science  of  human  develop-
ment,  I  approach  today’s  hearing  with  mixed  emotions.  While  I’m  pleased  to  see
that the Agency is working to remedy both its financial affairs as well as recent set-
backs for its Shuttle program, I remain concerned that its pursuit of an unqualified
audit  opinion  remains  bogged  down  in  mismanagement  and  deeply  flawed  account-
ing practices.

For  the  second  year  in  a  row,  NASA  has  been  given  a  ‘‘disclaimer’’  rating  on  its
annual  financial  statements,  and  is  one  of  only  five  federal  agencies  to  be  rated  as
such. While, on balance, most agencies across the Federal Government have contrib-
uted  to  the  goal  of  achieving  a  government-wide  clean  audit  opinion,  NASA  has
proven to be a weight on the process. If NASA is to be deemed worthy of additional
funding in an era of scarce discretionary resources, it must improve upon its efforts
to identify and remedy both short- and long-term structural deficiencies.

The  recent  audit  opinion  for  NASA  clearly  details  the  depth  of  its  financial  man-
agement  problems,  particularly  within  financial  management  systems  that  are  cru-
cial  for  measuring  Agency  activities  and  performance.  While  I  realize  that  agency
conversion to a new financial management program is daunting, it does not explain
the  broad  deficiencies  in  Agency  controls  and  accounting  for  NASA  owned  con-
tractor-held assets.

Since  1990,  NASA  has  been  deemed  a  ‘‘high-risk’’  agency  by  GAO  for  its  failure
to implement adequate financial management practices, while continued Agency at-
tempts at financial systems integration has already cost taxpayers nearly $200 mil-
lion. More, deficiencies in preparing Agency financial statements and reconciling its
fund  balances  with  Treasury  place  NASA  in  violation  of  multiple  requirements  by
OMB  and  under  the  Federal  Financial  Management  Improvement  Act  of  1996.  For
these  reasons,  I  believe  only  long-term  systemic  financial  management  reform  will
enable NASA to achieve a clean audit.

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about the ways in which NASA can
improve  its  audit  results  through  internal  accountability  and  more  effective  finan-
cial management of its scarce resources.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Jackson Lee follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

I  thank  Chairman  Calvert  and  Ranking  Member  Udall  as  well  as  Chairman
Platts  and  Ranking  Member  Towns  for  your  efforts  in  holding  today’s  joint  hearing
on  the  financial  management  of  NASA.  Furthermore,  the  distinguished  panels  of
witnesses are to be thanked for their responsiveness to our call to testify.

Important  to  today’s  hearing  is  the  fact  that  of  the  $15  million  net  increase  in
appropriations passed in the FY 2006 Science, State, Justice, and Commerce (SSJC)
bill (H.R. 2862), $31 million was cut from ‘‘corporate administrative costs.’’ The up-
coming  budget  reconciliation  proposals  exacerbated  by  the  outlays  made  to  assist
victims of the two—now three major hurricanes make the job of responsibly focusing
resources very difficult. Hence, our oversight will be crucial in underscoring the pri-
orities.

Funding-wise,  the  Administration  will  face  a  crisis  in  terms  of  its  workforce.  The
way  that  the  request  is  structured,  the  number  of  full-time  equivalents  (FTEs)  will
be reduced from 19,227 in FY 2005 to 16,738 by the end of FY 2006.

Relative to space exploration, our Hubble Space Telescope mission seems tenuous
given the $220 million discrepancy between the House and Senate passed appropria-
tions for a servicing project.

One of my questions will be to NASA’s Chief Financial Officer and to the Program
Executive  Officer  of  the  Integrated  Enterprise  Management  Division  as  to  how  or
whether the FY 2006 budget request accounts for proposals to fund the Vision—the
program that calls for NASA to return humans to the Moon by 2020 and eventually
to  Mars.  The  following  excerpt  from  a  CRS  Report  entitled  ‘‘The  National  Aero-
nautics and Space Administration’s FY 2006 Budget Request: Description, Analysis,
and Issues for Congress’’:1

The President did not propose adding significant sums to NASA’s budget to pay
for  the  Vision.  Instead,  most  of  the  funding  was  to  be  redirected  from  NASA’s
other  activities.  For  example,  the  White  House  announced  that  $12.6  billion
would be made available for the Vision from FY 2005–2009, but only $1 billion
of  that  was  new  money.  The  remaining  $11.6  billion  would  come  from  other
NASA activities. Taking most of the requisite funds from other NASA programs
instead  of  adding  new  money  for  the  Agency  could  mitigate  concerns  that  the
Vision might increase the deficit or detract from other national priorities.

This  excerpt  illustrates  the  extent  of  the  judgment  that  must  be  exercised  in  de-
ciding  how  much  funding  will  go  to  important  exploratory  and  research  projects
such as Vision given the fact that other programs will suffer with certainty.

At  Dr.  Griffin’s  April  2005  confirmation  hearing,  he  indicated  that  ‘‘the  total
amount of NASA funding is not the problem, . . .NASA received approximately the
same  amount  of  money  in  its  first  16  years  as  it  has  in  the  past  16  years.  In-
stead. . .it is a matter of setting priorities.’’ His chief priorities as enumerated were
returning  the  Shuttle  to  flight  and  making  each  flight  as  safe  as  possible,  com-
pleting  construction  of  the  Space  Station  by  2010,  terminating  the  Shuttle  in  2010,
and  accelerating  the  development  of  the  CEV  to  minimize  the  gap  between  when
the  Shuttle  ends  and  the  CEV  is  available.  I  will  look  to  query  the  witnesses  as
to  where  they  would  make  cuts  to  meet  these  goals  given  the  proposed  funding  ex-
pected to come out of the Conference Report on the SSJC Appropriations Act for FY
2006.

Chairs and Ranking Members, again, I show my appreciation to you for the effort
expended  in  putting  today’s  hearing  together,  and  I  look  forward  to  receiving  an-
swers to the important questions that we pose.

Chairman  CALVERT.  We  are  going  to  start  testimony  from  each
of  our  witnesses.  We  have  a  five-minute  rule  here,  just  to  remind
you.  Certainly,  your  entire  statement  will  be  entered  into  the
record,  so  understand  the  green  light  means  there  are  four  min-
utes,  the  yellow  light  means  there  is  a  minute  left,  and  the  red
light  means  you  are  out  of  time.  So  let  us  try  to  stay  as  much  as
possible to the five-minute rule so we have plenty of time for ques-
tions.

And  with  that,  Ms.  Sykes,  you  are  recognized  for  five  minutes.

STATEMENT OF HON. GWENDOLYN SYKES, CHIEF FINANCIAL

OFFICER, NASA

Ms. SYKES. Thank you, Chairman Calvert.
Chairman  Calvert,  Chairman  Platts,  and  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee,  I  am  here  this  morning  to  give  you  an  update  on  the
challenges and steps that NASA has taken to improve its financial
management performance.

Since  I  last  reported  to  the  Subcommittee  on  Government  Effi-
ciency  and  Financial  Management  on  May  19,  2004,  NASA  has
taken  actions  towards  enhancing  its  financial  performance.  A  sig-
nificant  step  in  the  right  direction  is  now  all  ten  Center  CFOs  re-
port directly to the Agency CFO.

Prior  to  my  arrival  and  my  hearing  with  the  Subcommittee,  the
NASA Center CFOs reported directly to the directors of each of the
NASA  Centers.  With  the  support  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Govern-
ment Efficiency and Financial Management, NASA’s financial lead-
ership  was  realigned  under  the  Agency  CFO,  and  we  are  devel-
oping into a strong, unified community with common objectives.

Given  the  challenges  that  lay  ahead  for  our  agency  as  it  relates
to  financial  management,  we  CFOs  meet  on  a  quarterly  basis  to
plan, update, and track our progress in addressing key issues that
relate to our overall financial management plan.

Today,  I  have  my  team  here  with  me.  We  have  Tommy  Moyles,
Robert  Gardner,  Bruce  Ward,  Nancy  Abell,  John  Beall,  Napoleon
Carroll, Kenneth Winter, Susan Foster, Jim Bevis, and Dale John-
son.  These  are  the  Center  CFOs  that  are  with  me  here  today  as
one of the examples of the many changes that we have made in the
area of financial management since our last report to Congress.

As  you  recall,  the  integration  of  the  NASA  Financial  Manage-
ment  began  back  in  2003  with  the  implementation  of  the  Core  Fi-
nancial  System.  Before  Core  Financial,  all  of  the  NASA’s  ten  Cen-
ters  operated  separately  and  succinctly  with  regard  to  financial

20

management  objectives,  processes,  and  systems.  A  loose  set  of  fi-
nancial management policies provided high-level guidance.

Today, every Center operates under one transaction-based finan-
cial  system  as  the  system  of  record  for  the  financial  management
at NASA. Today, every Center, in fact, everyone at NASA, operates
under  the  newly-revised  financial  management  requirement,  pro-
viding  common  policies  and  procedures  for  all  financial  operations.
The changes NASA has been making to integrate and improve its
financial management have not been easy nor problem-free. The in-
troduction of the Core Financial System highlighted differences and
process  of  accounting  treatment,  small  or  large,  across  all  of  our
Centers.  The  consolidation  of  unlike  data  caused  by  these  dif-
ferences resulted in serious conversion-related account balances.

The  introduction  of  new  ways  of  recording  and  posting  financial
data highlighted issues with the initial configuration of our system.
NASA’s  implementation  of  the  SAP  software  for  Core  Finance  was
the  beta  for  the  future  agencies  and  their  efforts  on  an  enterprise
system for financial management.

As  the  beta  organization,  we  have  encountered  configuration
issues  in  the  data  being  posted  to  incorrect  accounts.  This  means
that  NASA  has  had  to  spend  an  inordinate  amount  of  time  recon-
ciling  accounts  and  implementing  compensating  controls  to  ensure
the accuracy of the information being placed within our system.

Our research tells us that these are typical issues that any major
financial system implementation faces. This doesn’t make it easier,
but  it  helps  us  to  stay  focused  on  the  goal  of  being  able  to  provide
project  and  program  managers  with  the  timely,  accurate,  and  reli-
able  data  so  they  can  manage  their  programs  effectively  and  effi-
ciently.  We  have  taken  steps  to  address  the  root  causes  of  these
issues,  but  the  fact  remains  that  NASA  did  receive  a  disclaimer  of
its financial statements during the fiscal year 2004 financial state-
ment audit, and four major weaknesses were identified.

In  my  written  testimony,  I  have  described  in  detail  the  progress
NASA  has  made  in  addressing  these  weaknesses  and  the  steps
taken to address known systemic issues.

to date.

Let  me  briefly  highlight  some  of  the  actions  that  we  have  taken

The  first  noted  weakness  concerned  the  problem  with  Fund  Bal-
ance  with  Treasury.  Difference  in  NASA’s  Fund  Balance  with
Treasury,  basically  the  difference  between  our  checkbook  and  the
balance at the bank, Treasury, stood at $1.743 billion in fiscal year
2003.  This  difference  was  the  result  of  imbalances  and  errors  re-
sulting from conversion of our data from the ten NASA Centers.

As  of  September  30,  2005,  two  years  later,  after  careful  study
and analysis and correction, NASA’s current difference with Treas-
ury  is  $46.6  million.  This  is  still  a  lot  of  money,  but  our  monthly
reconciliation  process  established  over  the  past  year  tells  us  that
over 80 percent of the difference is related to unsettled intergovern-
mental  transactions,  and  the  remaining  20  percent  are  the  recon-
ciling differences.

The process that NASA has put in place requiring that each Cen-
ter perform monthly reconciliations of its Fund Balance with Treas-
ury  accounts  helps  ensure  that  NASA’s  differences  never  again
grow  beyond  our  current  control.  And  the  certifications  of  the  rec-

onciliation  that  the  CFOs  seated  behind  me  must  provide  on  a
monthly  basis  give  me  even  greater  confidence  that  our  Fund  Bal-
ance with Treasury issues are fully being addressed.

NASA’s auditors also identified issues with our ability to prepare
financial statements. Several software-related issues limit our abil-
ity to provide auditors with sufficient transactions and audit trails
with credible balances for key accounts. We have made progress in
resolving the underlying issues in contributing to those weaknesses
through  software  fixes  and  improved  financial  management  prepa-
ration.  As  a  result,  our  year-end  financial  statements  were  gen-
erated  directly  from  our  Core  Financial  System  with  our  balance
sheet in balance where assets equal liabilities.

NASA  is  making  steady  progress  in  its  goal  toward  solid  finan-
cial  management.  I  stand  firm  in  my  commitment  to  improving
NASA’s  financial  management  performance  and  ensuring  that  all
stakeholders  have  a  clear  and  accurate  assessment  of  how  NASA’s
resources  are  being  used  and  providing  decision-makers  with  the
access to accurate, timely, and reliable data.

Thank you, Chairman Calvert.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Sykes follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GWENDOLYN SYKES

Chairman  Calvert,  Chairman  Platts  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittees,  I  am
pleased  to  be  here  this  morning  to  give  you  an  update  on  the  progress  of  NASA’s
efforts  to  improve  our  financial  management  performance.  Since  I  last  reported  to
the Subcommittee on Government Efficiency and Financial Management on May 19,
2004,  NASA  has  taken  many  steps  toward  improved  financial  performance,  and  I
am  proud  to  be  able  to  speak  with  you  today  about  those  steps,  and  the  results  we
have achieved in moving the Agency forward in financial management.

Over  the  past  17  months,  much  has  changed  at  NASA.  As  you  are  aware,  NASA
has  recently  embarked  on  its  new  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  leading  us  to  re-
evaluate operational and planned missions in light of our new goals. We, in the Of-
fice  of  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  (OCFO),  are  working  in  close  partnership  with
the NASA Mission Directorates, programs and projects to support these efforts.

The  confirmation  of  Dr.  Michael  Griffin  as  NASA  Administrator  has  also  helped
to  emphasize  the  importance  of  effective  financial  management  across  all  parts  of
the Agency. In response to guidance from the Administrator upon his confirmation,
Patrick Ciganer and I convened a Senior Advisory Group consisting of leaders from
the  Federal  Government  including  the  Under  Secretary  of  Education  and  the  Con-
troller of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). We worked closely with the
advisory group to review the current financial management improvement plan to en-
sure  we  had  the  right  strategy,  body  of  work,  and  resources  to  address  the  chal-
lenges  that  face  NASA.  The  group’s  insight  proved  so  effective  that  we  have  insti-
tuted  monthly  meetings,  which  we  use  to  gain  continued  insight  and  guidance  as
we  move  forward  on  our  path  towards  more  effective  financial  management  oper-
ations at NASA.

At  that  group’s  suggestion,  and  under  the  direct  authority  of  the  Administrator,
we have also created a Financial Integration Team, or FIT, in recognition that many
NASA organizations outside of the OCFO have responsibility for, and contribute to,
our  Agency’s  financial  health.  Their  full  support  is  essential  to  improving  NASA’s
financial  management  and  the  FIT  has  been  instrumental  in  coordinating  Agency-
wide  resources  to  address  and  resolve  the  financial  challenges  that  you  have  asked
me to report on today.

In  my  2004  testimony,  I  described  several  of  the  challenges  facing  NASA  in  the
area  of  financial  management.  Additional  challenges  were  highlighted  in  the  audit
of  our  financial  statements  for  that  year.  I  would  like  to  provide  an  update  to  you
today on the progress we have made and the challenges we continue to address.
Fund Balance With Treasury

NASA’s  September  30,  2003,  Fund  Balance  with  Treasury  (FBWT)  contained  a
$1.743  billion  discrepancy  between  the  U.S.  Treasury  (Treasury)  balance  and  the
amount  that  was  reported  from  the  NASA  Integrated  Enterprise  Management  Pro-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

gram  Core  Financial  System.  Since  that  time,  NASA  has  taken  several  corrective
actions to significantly reduce our differences with Treasury’s balances and improve
internal controls over data integrity.

In  FY  2003  and  FY  2004  a  material  weakness  was  reported  for  differences  in
NASA’s FBWT account balance. Differences were due in large part to the consolida-
tion  of  imbalances  from  ten  disparate  accounting  systems  and  data  integrity  issues
associated  with  the  conversion  process  and  implementation  of  the  Core  Financial
System.

Furthermore,  the  FY  2004  financial  statement  audit  report  indicated  that  NASA
lacked formalized procedures to analyze accounting data. It also found that a strong
oversight  function  was  needed  to  ensure  that  periodic  analyses  and  reconciliations
are  completed  to  detect  and  resolve  errors  and  irregularities  in  a  timely  manner.
To  address  these  findings,  NASA  developed  and  implemented  standard  monthly
reconciliation  and  correction  policies  and  procedures  for  its  FBWT  accounts.  These
have  been  formally  published  in  NASA’s  Financial  Management  Requirements.
NASA has also implemented monthly Headquarters reviews of those reconciliations
to  ensure  compliance  with  NASA  policy  and  to  increase  oversight  of  the  Agency’s
FBWT and any associated differences.

Through these efforts, NASA has reduced its differences in the amounts reported
by  Treasury  and  NASA’s  books  of  record  for  FBWT  by  over  97  percent.  The  Sep-
tember 2005, year-end FBWT difference was $46.5 million, versus the $1.743 billion
difference  reported  at  year-end  of  FY  2003.  Of  this  $46.5  million  FBWT  difference,
$35.8 million is due to September’s increase in transactions with other intergovern-
mental entities. The remaining $10.7 million has been reconciled.

NASA is implementing an agency-wide automated tool to assist all Centers in the
reconciliation of FBWT. This tool will provide increased speed and accuracy in iden-
tifying  and  reconciling  differences  with  Treasury.  It  will  also  increase  NASA’s  visi-
bility at Headquarters into the actions taken by NASA Centers to identify and cor-
rect differences with Treasury.
FY 2005 Year-End Close

Contributing  to  our  control  weaknesses  last  year  were  several  software  related
issues  that  limited  our  ability  to  provide  the  auditors  with  sufficient  transaction
audit trails and with credible balances to support key accounts. While we were able
to  provide  the  information  to  the  auditors  using  systems  and  processes  outside  of
our  Core  Financial  System,  our  inability  to  provide  them  through  the  system  re-
sulted in a negative audit finding.

Over  the  past  year,  we  have  made  progress  toward  resolving  the  underlying
issues  contributing  to  those  weaknesses.  The  result  of  our  improvements  is  that
most of our financial statements are generated directly from our Core Financial sys-
tem,  using  the  transactional  data  mapped  detail  by  detail  to  financial  statements.
This  year’s  publication  of  the  NASA  Financial  Management  Procedures,  a  com-
panion set of guidance to NASA’s Financial Management Requirements (FMR), pro-
vided  guidelines  that  improved  the  consistency,  effectiveness  and  accuracy  of
NASA’s  year-end  closing  process.  NASA  also  increased  its  testing  of  the  financial
statement  preparation  process  and  implemented  monthly  and  quarterly  financial
statement analysis accompanied by greater supporting detail and enhanced controls.
We will continue to monitor our financial statement procedures to seek opportuni-

ties for streamlining our process.
Environmental Liabilities

For  FY  2004,  NASA’s  financial  statement  auditors  identified  weaknesses  in
NASA’s  estimation  of  its  environmental  liabilities  (e.g.,  asbestos  removal,  ground-
water  contamination  clean-up,  etc.).  Key  issues  included  insufficient  definition  of
roles  and  responsibilities  among  all  parties  involved  in  estimating  these  liabilities,
and insufficient policies, procedures and training in the estimation process.

The resolution of this weakness requires close coordination and cooperation across
several  NASA  organizations.  OCFO  and  NASA’s  Environmental  Management  Divi-
sion  (EMD)  have  partnered  to  coordinate  policies,  processes  and  controls  for  esti-
mating  NASA’s  environmental  liabilities.  We  have  developed  and  documented  envi-
ronmental  liabilities  estimating  procedures  and  distributed  them  to  all  Centers.
These  procedures  will  be  enhanced  in  FY  2006  to  ensure  greater  consistency  and
reliability  in  NASA’s  estimates.  In  addition,  the  partnership  will  establish  a  robust
quality assurance process.

In  conjunction  with  EMD,  OCFO  has  also  developed  and  conducted  policy  and
guidance  training  for  estimating  environmental  liabilities.  Beginning  in  FY  2006,
OCFO  will  enhance  training  and  include  the  Center  CFO  staff  as  an  integral  part
of the estimate preparation and review process.

While we have accomplished a great deal toward addressing this reportable condi-
tion,  it  will  take  time  to  realize  results.  Therefore,  these  results  are  unlikely  to  be
reflected in NASA’s 2005 financial audit.
Property, Plant and Equipment

The  last  major  finding  from  NASA’s  financial  statement  audits  concerns  weak-
nesses in NASA’s ability to recognize and account for its property, plant, and equip-
ment  (PP&E),  and  in  particular  its  ‘‘theme  assets’’  or,  the  products,  such  as  the
Space  Shuttle  and  Hubble  Space  Telescope,  that  are  developed  in  direct  support  of
NASA’s  mission.  NASA’s  FY  2004  audit  report  recommended  that  NASA  review  its
accounting  policies  governing  how  the  Agency  determines  the  value  of  these  prod-
ucts  as  they  are  being  developed.  NASA  auditors  also  cited  the  need  for  improved
processes and controls for tracking parts and components.

In response, NASA reviewed and evaluated its capitalization policy for these prod-
ucts  to  determine  if  the  policy  provided  useful,  meaningful  and  timely  financial  in-
formation to decision-makers and stakeholders as suggested by the objectives of fed-
eral  financial  reporting.  Based  on  that  evaluation,  NASA  has  revised  its  capitaliza-
tion policy and is currently formulating supporting procedures for implementing the
approach.

Beyond accounting treatment, resolving PP&E valuation and controls weaknesses
requires  the  integration  and  improvement  of  overall  acquisition,  development,  and
disposal processes. The FIT established a cross-functional PP&E team comprised of
members representing NASA’s Institutional Management, Procurement, and Finan-
cial  Management  functions.  The  team  is  conducting  a  comprehensive  review  of
NASA’s  product  acquisition,  development,  disposal,  and  accounting  processes  and
controls  and  developing  recommendations  for  improving  them.  These  recommenda-
tions  will  be  evaluated  for  implementation  over  the  course  of  the  next  several
months.

While  taking  steps  to  improve  its  internal  processes,  NASA  has  also  taken  steps
to improve contractor compliance with NASA’s PP&E policies. Contractors currently
hold  over  $9  billion  worth  of  NASA  PP&E,  representing  a  significant  and  material
portion of our balance sheet. We are working directly with our contractors to ensure
they have proper training and controls to implement policy. We have also expanded
our  contract  with  the  Defense  Contract  Audit  Agency  to  increase  our  oversight  of
contractor compliance.

Improving these processes will not only enable NASA to improve its ability to ac-
curately control and value assets but will also help pave the way for the successful
implementation of NASA’s Integrated Asset Management (IAM) module. Ultimately,
IAM, an integral part of the Agency’s Integrated Enterprise Management (IEM) sys-
tem will integrate, automate and strengthen control of NASA’s PP&E processes. The
recent  re-phasing  of  IAM’s  schedule  is  based  on  priority  being  given  to  the  SAP
Version Upgrade in October 2006, and the introduction of NASA’s new budget struc-
ture.  Given  the  changes  to  the  schedule,  the  PP&E  recommendations  will  include
internal  controls  designed  to  address  weaknesses  so  that  PP&E  processes  are  im-
proved before IAM is implemented.
Internal Controls

OMB recently released enhanced guidance for improving internal controls over fi-
nancial  reporting  and  documentation  in  OMB  Circular  A–123,  ‘‘Management’s  Re-
sponsibility  for  Internal  Control.’’  In  August  2005,  we  provided  NASA’s  high-level
plan for implementing the new requirements to OMB. Our goal is to satisfy the re-
quirement by applying the guidance to four key accounts in FY 2006: FBWT, Mate-
rials  and  Supplies,  PP&E,  and  Environmental  Liabilities.  We  have  crafted  a  plan
that should move us toward successful compliance with the new requirement.

To set the stage for work that will be done this fiscal year, agency-wide financial
management  internal  control  assistance  visits,  risk-assessments  and  self-assess-
ments were conducted at all ten NASA Centers in FY 2005. Those activities helped
refocus  and  reinvigorated  interest  in  financial  internal  controls  across  the  Agency
and  provided  information  that  will  serve  as  a  baseline  for  the  upcoming  FY  2006
internal controls assessments.
Overall Improvements

To  ensure  that  these  improvements  are  sustained,  OCFO  has  also  taken  steps  to
enhance  our  workforce  and  improve  our  internal  processes.  Over  the  past  several
years,  OCFO  staffing  levels  have  been  inadequate  to  successfully  address  our  chal-
lenges  and  operate  on  a  going  forward  basis.  We  simply  have  not  had  the  staff,  in
terms  of  both  head-count  and  skill  set  mix,  to  contend  with  the  many  changes  we
have  faced.  New  responsibilities,  new  systems,  new  processes,  new  federal  require-

24

ments  and  changing  expectations  from  our  customers  all  require  a  flexible,  well-
trained and appropriately staffed financial management organization.

To  address  these  issues,  the  NASA  Administrator  has  made  a  personal  commit-
ment  towards  improving  our  posture,  including  approving  staff  increases  in  FY
2005. In the past month, we have begun to increase our staff in the budget and ac-
counting  functions.  In  addition,  we  have  undertaken  a  series  of  workforce  develop-
ment  initiatives  aimed  at  enhancing  and  improving  the  skills  of  our  staff.  One  of
our  first  priorities  has  been  to  ensure  that  we  are  providing  staff  with  the  skills
and tools they need to respond to changes in policy, process and procedures related
to  the  implementation  of  the  Core  Financial  System.  Prior  to  the  implementation
of Core Financial, the NASA community participated in extensive preparatory train-
ing.  We  are  now  supplementing  that  training  with  refresher  courses  that  incor-
porate our lessons learned.

Within OCFO, we are also establishing a training curriculum to help ensure that
the financial community is equipped with the skills and knowledge required to fulfill
current  job  responsibilities  while  developing  new  analytical  skills  needed  to  fulfill
new roles. Recognizing our obligation to provide the NASA community with the tools
and knowledge need to make sound financial and resource decisions, OCFO has also
developed  and  piloted  a  course  entitled  ‘‘Financial  Management  for  Non-Financial
Managers.’’  We  are  currently  exploring  ways  to  roll-out  the  course  to  the  broader
NASA community in 2006.

NASA  has  also  lacked  consistent  policies  and  processes.  Through  NASA’s  Finan-
cial  Management  Requirements  (FMR),  we  have  established  a  single  set  of  policies
for  NASA  financial  management.  All  Centers,  all  programs,  all  projects  and  all  in-
stitutional  functions  are  required  to  adopt  and  comply  with  these  policies.  The  im-
plementation  of  the  FMR  is  helping  us  to  both  increase  the  consistency  in  philoso-
phies  and  approaches  to  the  treatment  of  financial  management  across  NASA  and
to  generate  constructive  debate  about  the  ways  in  which  we  have  chosen  to  move
forward.  As  a  result,  new  processes  have  been  developed  and  implemented  across
the Agency that incorporate best practices from our Centers and programs.

In  summary,  NASA  is  making  steady  progress  in  addressing  the  Agency’s  finan-
cial  management  challenges.  I  am  confident  that  we  are  well  on  our  way  toward
enhancing  financial  management  at  NASA,  one  step  at  a  time.  Even  though  NASA
may  not  receive  a  clean  opinion  on  our  statements  in  2005,  the  Agency  has  made
headway and we will continue to push forward in meeting this challenge.

I  reiterate  my  full  commitment  to  improving  NASA’s  financial  management  per-
formance,  to  ensuring  that  all  stakeholders  have  a  clear  and  accurate  assessment
of how NASA’s resources are being used, and to providing decision-makers with ac-
cess  to  accurate,  timely  and  reliable  data.  We  are  making  steady,  measurable
progress toward those goals.

Mr. Chairmen, I would be pleased to respond to questions.

BIOGRAPHY FOR GWENDOLYN SYKES

Gwendolyn  Sykes  is  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  for  the  National  Aeronautics  and
Space  Administration  (NASA).  Through  her  leadership,  Ms.  Sykes  ensures  the  fi-
nancial  health  of  the  organization,  including  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  NASA
resources are effectively employed toward the achievement of NASA’s strategic plan.
She  manages  the  organization’s  budget  and  financial  operations,  directs  the  prepa-
ration  and  submission  of  annual  financial  and  budgetary  reports,  and  coordinates
Agency  financial  management  activities  with  other  federal  agencies.  She  also  is  an
active  participant  with  other  agency  Chief  Financial  Officers  in  supporting  imple-
mentation of the President’s Management Agenda.

Ms.  Sykes  joined  NASA  in  November  2002  when  she  was  selected  as  the  Deputy
Chief  Financial  Officer  for  Financial  Management.  Since  that  time,  she  has  made
significant  strides  toward  improving  agency-wide  financial  integrity.  She  has
launched several management initiatives, aligned with the principles of the Federal
Government’s  Joint  Financial  Management  Improvement  Program  (JFMIP),  de-
signed to improve NASA’s financial health and performance. Her leadership and re-
sourcefulness are invaluable assets to the NASA community.

Prior to arriving at NASA, Ms. Sykes provided program and financial control sup-
port to the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). She was instrumental in insti-
tuting streamlined financial reporting requirements and developing electronic finan-
cial  management  reports,  significantly  reducing  the  amount  of  paper  work  that
flowed from the Department of Defense to the Department of Treasury and the Of-
fice of Management and Budget.

Ms. Sykes began her public service career with the Defense Contract Audit Agen-
cy. Subsequently, she served as a legislative correspondent for Senator Ted Stevens,
where she coordinated activities related to protecting Alaska’s vital fishery industry
during the Valdez oil spill.

In  20303,  Ms.  Sykes  was  awarded  the  NASA  Exceptional  Achievement  Medal  for
outstanding budgetary and financial management leadership of the NASA financial
community.  She  is  considered  an  expert  in  the  areas  of  accounting  and  financial
management,  and  frequently  lectures  at  a  variety  of  financial  management  con-
ferences and symposia.

Financial Management Program in NASA.
You are recognized, sir, for five minutes.

STATEMENT OF MR. PATRICK CIGANER, EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

INTEGRATED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, NASA
Mr. CIGANER. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I am here this
morning  to  report  on  the  current  state  of  NASA’s  long-term  plan
to  deploy  and  operate  the  broad  range  of  new  processes  and  sys-
tems  collectively  developed  under  our  Integrated  Enterprise  Man-
agement Program initiative.

The  overall  objective  of  this  effort  is  to  enable  the  Agency  to  op-
erate and manage more efficiently and transparently its major pro-
grams and initiatives. In summary, we are aiming at providing the
necessary  tools  and  information  to  allow  NASA  to  make  better
business  decisions  in  planning  and  managing  its  investments  and
major  undertakings.  This  objective  goes  beyond  just  being  able  to
consistently identify and record accounting information. In order to
succeed,  we  must  generate  timely  and  reliable  accounting,  finan-
cial,  and  project  information  supporting  all  levels  of  our  agency’s
decision-making process.

For  historical  context,  in  fiscal  year  2000,  after  two  previously
unsuccessful  attempts  in  the  previous  decade,  NASA  initiated  a

29

long-term, agency-wide effort aimed at operating under a single, in-
tegrated  suite  of  financial,  project,  contract,  and  human  capital
management tools.

To  reach  this  goal,  NASA  selected  an  Enterprise  Resource  Plan-
ning suite of commercial-off-the-shelf software applications and de-
signed  and  implemented  new  processes  and  operating  practices
consistent with the selected systems and tools.

For  its  financial  accounting  and  reporting,  the  Agency  licensed
the Core Financial software application from SAP, and the integra-
tion support was provided by our Center. In implementing this ap-
plication,  NASA  became  one  of  the  first  agencies  in  the  U.S.  gov-
ernment to deploy a single ERP-based accounting system.

It  should  also  be  noted  that,  in  contrast  to  many  private  sector
organizations of this size and complexity, due to resource and budg-
etary constraints, NASA did not have the ability of running its leg-
acy  accounting  system  in  parallel  to  its  new  system  for  a  few
months  before  cutting  over.  Additionally,  and  again  in  contrast  to
most organizations in the private sector, a very large volume of de-
tailed  historical  accounting  and  contractual  data  had  to  be  con-
verted at the same time to enable the generation of regulatory-com-
pliant financial statements and related audit trails.

When we last presented our status before Congress in May 2004,
the  Agency  had  been  operating  for  eight  months  using  our  new
Core  Financial  module,  which  replaced  over  10  major  and  140
minor  local  and  often  incompatible  accounting  systems  and  sub-
systems.  Incidentally,  NASA  also  migrated  to  full  cost  accounting
and reporting as part of this implementation.

We are now entering our third fiscal year of operation under this
new  accounting  and  financial  reporting  environment,  along  with
using  several  other  related  human  capital  and  business  manage-
ment tools, which are also part of the IEMP initiative.

The  operation  of  our  Core  Financial  module  has  allowed  NASA
over  the  past  two  years  to  identify  additional  agency-specific  sys-
tem  and  process  areas,  which  needed  further  improvement.  We
have  worked  closely  with  both  our  integrator  and  software  vendor
to  develop  those  identified  enhancements,  and  most  of  them  are
part  of  our  forthcoming  2006  upgrade  to  our  current  software
version.

Additionally, as the quality of our historical and current financial
information  gradually  improved  over  the  past  two  years,  we  are
now ready to enter the next phase of our plan, which is to provide
an  enhanced  correlation  of  accounting  and  project  management  fi-
nancial  information.  This  added  functionality  is  also  a  key  compo-
nent  in  being  able  to  generate  more  realistic  and  dependable  cost
estimates for our project and programs.

We  are  more  than  halfway  through  the  full  implementation  of
the current IEM planned functionality. Forthcoming capabilities in
the next three years will include standardized contract generation,
monitoring  and  reporting,  enhanced  tracking  and  management  of
environmentally-sensitive assets, integrated inventory controls and
automated  warehousing  systems,  agency-wide  property  and  equip-
ment  management,  deeper  integration  of  contractor-held  property
valuation  procedures  and  reporting  methodologies,  and  the  deploy-
ment  of  more  powerful  project  and  program  management  tools  in-

cluding  Earned  Value  Management  applications  and  an  agency-
wide  Labor  Distribution  system.  As  you  can  see,  those  capabilities
will  take  us  beyond  financial  accounting  and  reporting  into  fun-
damentally  transforming  how  NASA  manages  itself.  That  is  our
goal.

Experience has shown that in significant business transformation
efforts,  the  technical  facet  of  the  implementation  is  usually  easier
to  manage  than  the  training  component.  One  can  design  and  de-
ploy  a  very  powerful  system  meeting  all  of  the  internal  and  exter-
nal requirements, but if no one uses it, or has great difficulty using
it,  in  the  long  term,  this  effort  might  be  left  wanting.  We  are  ad-
dressing  this  important  issue  by  enhancing  the  collection  of  end-
user  feedback  and  focusing  on  improved  training  approaches  and
communication.

We have also been working closely with GAO in identifying areas
of possible improvement for the implementation of our forthcoming
modules. We fully endorsed and adopted all GAO recommendations
for  all  future  module  development.  The  development  and  imple-
mentation  of  IEMP  will  be  completed  in  fiscal  year  2008,  and  the
current life cycle cost estimate for this development and implemen-
tation  is  $662.6  million.  We  are  also  updating  our  program  life
cycle cost estimate.

In  conclusion,  NASA  is  again  involved  in  a  multi-year,  complex,
difficult,  and  far-reaching  initiative.  In  this  instance,  though,  the
objective  is  far  more  prosaic  than  what  our  deep  space  exploration
or human space flight missions aim to accomplish, but not less im-
portant.  We  clearly  understand  that,  if  we  are  to  meet  our  long-
term  goals  as  an  agency,  we  must  continuously  improve  not  only
the accounting of our finances, but the way we manage our invest-
ments, our programs, and our people.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Ciganer follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF PATRICK CIGANER

Mr. Chairmen and Members of the Subcommittees, I am here this morning to re-
port  on  the  current  state  of  NASA’s  long-term  plan  to  deploy  and  operate  a  broad
range of new processes and systems collectively developed under our Integrated En-
terprise Management Program (IEMP) initiative. The overall objective of this effort
is  to  enable  the  Agency  to  operate  and  manage  more  efficiently  and  transparently
its major programs and initiatives. In summary, we are aiming at providing the nec-
essary  tools  and  information  to  allow  NASA  to  make  better  business  decisions  in
planning and managing its investments and major undertakings. This objective goes
beyond  being  able  to  record  accounting  information.  In  order  to  succeed,  we  must
generate timely and reliable financial information for decision-making.

For  historical  context,  in  FY  2000,  after  two  previously  unsuccessful  attempts  in
the previous decade, NASA initiated a long-term, Agency-wide effort aimed at oper-
ating under a single, integrated suite of financial, project, contract and human cap-
ital  management  tools.  To  reach  this  goal,  NASA  selected  an  Enterprise  Resource
Planning  (ERP)  suite  of  commercial-off-the-shelf  (COTS)  software  applications  and
had to design and implement new Agency-specific processes and operating practices
consistent  with  the  selected  systems  and  tools.  For  its  financial  accounting  and  re-
porting,  the  Agency  licensed  the  Core  Financial  software  application  from  SAP  and
its integration and deployment was performed by the IEM Program (then known as
Integrated  Financial  Management,  or  IFM)  throughout  2003  with  primary  integra-
tion support provided by Accenture. In implementing this application, NASA became
one  of  the  first  agencies  in  the  U.S.  Government  to  deploy  a  single,  ERP-based,
Agency-wide  integrated  budget  execution  and  accounting  system  and,  as  such,  the
Agency  had  to  rely  mostly  on  private  sector  experiences,  lessons  learned  and  best
practices.

Core  Financial,  our  new  accounting  system,  would  become  the  foundation  upon
which the rest of our new business capabilities would be subsequently built. Its suc-
cessful  rollout,  adoption  and  operation  would  be  critical  to  the  success  of  all  fol-
lowing planned improvements. It should also be noted that, in contrast to many pri-
vate sector organizations of this size and complexity, due to resource and budgetary
constraints, NASA did not have the ability of running its legacy accounting systems
in  parallel  to  its  new  system  for  a  few  months  before  ‘‘cutting  over.’’  Additionally,
and  again,  in  contrast  to  most  organizations  in  the  private  sector,  a  very  large  vol-
ume  of  detailed  historical  accounting  and  contractual  data  had  to  be  converted  at
the same time to enable the generation of regulatory-compliant financial statements
and  related  audit  trails.  Finally,  private  sector  statistics  for  this  type  and  mag-
nitude  of  conversion  currently  show  that  approximately  seven  out  of  10  organiza-
tions  attempting  to  convert  to  an  ERP  from  distributed  legacy  systems  fail  in  their
first attempt.

When we last presented our status before the Subcommittee on Government Man-
agement,  Finance  and  Accountability,  in  May  2004,  the  Agency  had  been  operating
for  eight  months  using  our  new  Core  Financial  module,  which  replaced  over  10
major  and  140  minor  local  and  often  incompatible  accounting  systems  and  sub-
systems. This conversion also required fundamentally new procedures and processes
to  be  implemented  and  used.  Incidentally,  in  addition  to  the  rollout  of  the  Core  Fi-
nancial  module,  NASA  also  migrated  in  parallel  to  full  cost  accounting  and  report-
ing.

We  are  now  entering  our  third  fiscal  year  of  operation  under  this  new  financial
accounting  and  reporting  environment,  along  with  using  several  other  related
human capital and business management tools which are also part of our IEMP ini-
tiative.  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  update  the  Subcommittees  on  the
current status of the various facets of this far-ranging effort and report on our forth-
coming next phase of upgrades, deployments and related challenges.

The deployment and subsequent initial ‘‘live’’ operation of our Core Financial mod-
ule  has  allowed  NASA,  over  the  past  two  years,  to  identify  additional  Agency-spe-
cific  system  and  process  areas  which  needed  further  improvement  in  order  to  effi-
ciently  log  and  report  in  detail  certain  types  of  transactions  and  postings  to  our
General Ledger and related reporting environments and databases. We have worked
closely with both our software vendor and our integrator to develop those identified
enhancements  and  most  of  them  are  part  of  our  forthcoming  2006  scheduled  up-
grade to our existing version of the software application.

Additionally,  as  the  quality  of  our  historical  and  current  financial  information
gradually improved over the past two years through the ability, brought by the con-
version  of  the  legacy  data  to  our  new  system,  to  identify  erroneous  or  incomplete
historical  information,  we  are  now  ready  to  enter  the  next  phase  of  our  plan  which
is  to  provide  an  enhanced  correlation  of  accounting  and  project  management  finan-
cial  information.  This  will  specifically  help  our  program  and  project  analysts  and
managers in their upcoming decisions related to assessing the cost-benefit perform-
ance  of  individual  project  task  elements  and  program  components.  This  Project
Management  Information  Initiative  (PMII)  is  being  deployed  Agency-wide  as  we
speak and was developed in close coordination with our Programmatic and Financial
users. This added functionality is also a key component in being able to better man-
age  the  cost  elements  of  our  existing  programs  and  develop  a  reliable  and  accurate
empirical  knowledge  base  to  be  used  in  generating  more  realistic  and  dependable
cost estimates for future projects and initiatives.

We  are  more  than  halfway  through  the  full  implementation  of  the  current  IEM
planned  functionality.  Forthcoming  capabilities  in  the  next  three  years  will  include
standardized  contract  generation,  monitoring  and  reporting,  enhanced  tracking  and
management  of  environmentally  sensitive  assets,  integrated  inventory  controls  and
automated  warehousing  systems,  Agency-wide  property  and  equipment  manage-
ment,  deeper  integration  of  contractor-held  property  valuation  procedures  and  re-
porting  methodologies  and  the  deployment  of  more  powerful  project  and  program
management  tools  including  Earned  Value  Management  applications  and  an  Agen-
cy-wide  Labor  Distribution  system.  As  you  can  see,  those  capabilities  will  take  us
beyond  financial  accounting  and  reporting  into  fundamentally  transforming  how
NASA manages itself. That is our goal.

As we move forward, one of our major challenges is to effectively analyze current
policies,  procedures  and  systems  related  to  those  activities  and  then  determine
whether the best and most cost-effective solution lies in integrating, updating or re-
placing existing processes and systems.

For  example,  in  the  case  of  aircraft  maintenance,  one  of  our  Centers  has  devel-
oped  for  internal  use  a  system  capable,  through  manageable  upgrades,  of  meeting
our Agency-wide requirements. After completing a detailed cost-benefit analysis, we

32

decided  to  enhance  this  system  for  Agency-wide  deployment  in  2007  rather  than
purchasing and deploying a completely new application and retiring all existing leg-
acy systems.

Our  approach  with  existing  legacy  systems  is  to  map  them  against  our  planned
requirements and determine, on a case by case basis, what implementation strategy
to adopt moving forward. One of the key elements in this decision process is weigh-
ing the training impact of migrating varied user communities to fundamentally dif-
ferent  operating  environments.  Experience  over  the  past  two  decades  has  shown
that  in  significant  business  transformation  efforts,  the  technical  facet  of  the  imple-
mentation  strategy  element  is  usually  easier  to  manage  than  the  training  compo-
nent.  In  summary,  one  can  design  and  deploy  a  very  powerful  system  meeting  all
of  the  internal  and  external  technical  and  operational  requirements,  but  if  no  one
uses  it  or  has  great  difficulty  using  it,  in  the  long-term,  this  effort  might  be  left
wanting.. . .

We  are  addressing  this  important  issue  by  enhancing  the  collection  of  end-user
feedback and focusing on a ‘‘Train the Trainer’’ approach in our methodology, where
highly respected and knowledgeable subject matter experts are selected and used to
lead  our  field  training  activities  thereby  increasing  the  initial  acceptance  in  the  in-
formation being presented.

We  also  respect  and  pro-actively  support  the  dynamic  nature  of  our  Agency.  Our
original  IEM  plan  and  schedule  was  generated  in  2000;  since  then,  although  we
have been reasonably successful to date in keeping our program on budget and with-
in  schedule,  some  of  our  Agency  priorities  have  changed  and  related  requirements
have  evolved.  We  try  to  be  flexible  enough  to  accommodate  those  changes  as  dem-
onstrated by the recent scheduling of our PMII and Core Financial Upgrade projects
ahead  of  several  (but  not  all)  of  the  modules  of  our  Integrated  Asset  Management
project.

Another  daunting  challenge  was  to  build  and  deploy  systems  meeting  required
levels  of  security  while  minimizing  the  operational  impact  on  authorized  users.
Since  the  system  went  into  full-scale  deployment  in  October  2003,  we  have  exten-
sively used input and recommendations from our external auditors and oversight or-
ganizations,  who  analyzed  our  initial  operations  to  improve  both  our  internal  con-
trols  and  operational  security  protocols  and  measures.  The  forthcoming  FY  2005
audit results should indicate how far we have gone in this effort, but this is clearly
a long-term process. Successfully managing the conversion to such a broad, complex
and  deeply  distributed  universe  of  integrated  processes,  controls  and  systems  takes
time, resolve and patience.

In  addition  to  consistently  trying  to  enhance  our  project  development  approach
with  each  new  module  through  an  exhaustive  and  inclusive  internal  ‘‘lessons
learned’’  process,  we  have  also  been  working  closely  with  the  Government  Account-
ability  Office  (GAO)  in  continuously  identifying  areas  of  possible  improvements  for
the  design,  development  and  deployment  of  our  forthcoming  modules.  We  fully  en-
dorse GAO recommendations in module development and are implementing all new
modules  using  an  enhanced  methodology  which  was  adopted  following  Industry
‘‘best practices.’’

For  example,  in  late  2003,  our  operation  facility,  the  IEMP  Competency  Center,
deployed a Test Management software tool that has since provided the basis for im-
proved  requirements  management  and  regression  testing  of  existing  and  forth-
coming  systems.  This  tool  was  quite  helpful  in  defining  the  front-end  requirements
and priorities of our 2006 major version upgrade to the Core Financial module. Ad-
ditionally,  a  separate  Quality  Assurance  team  was  established  last  year  as  part  of
the  Competency  Center  to  focus  on  improving  requirements  collection  and  docu-
mentation  for  all  current  and  future  IEMP  modules.  Following  this  deployment,  in
February 2004, the Quality Assurance team deployed another automated tool giving
us an additional level of control over managing, correlating and prioritizing the sev-
eral thousands of detailed requirements associated with the development, configura-
tion and performance of individual modules.

Now,  after  two  years,  our  operating  framework  is  fairly  stable  and  our  aim  is  to
steadily improve our requirements management procedures for both existing and fu-
ture  modules.  As  stated  in  the  related  GAO  report  on  future  IEM  module  develop-
ment and deployment, NASA is addressing the remaining outstanding requirements
documentation  issues  from  the  initial  Core  Financial  module  deployment  analysis
in time to integrate them into the design, development, and testing associated with
the SAP Version Upgrade activities scheduled for FY 2006. As this will be a complex
and challenging task, we plan to continue working closely with GAO on these activi-
ties and adopt their recommendations as efficiently as possible.

Specifically,  a  recent  GAO  report  section  titled,  ‘‘Improvements  Made  to  NASA’s
IEMP (IFMP) Life-Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCE) and Processes for Calculating Fund-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

33

ing  Reserves,’’  has  been  a  gratifying  observation,  but,  as  also  noted  by  the  GAO,
NASA’s  LCCE  was  a  ‘‘work  in  progress.’’  Since  then,  the  quality  and  detail  of  the
information  contained  in  our  LCCE  has  steadily  improved  as  we  continue  to  refine
the  mapping  of  IEMP  data  sources  to  the  new  PMII  Work  Breakdown  Structure
(WBS)  in  our  LCCE.  The  development  and  implementation  of  IEMP  will  be  com-
pleted in FY 2008, and the current LCCE for this development and implementation
is $662.6 million.

We  are  in  the  process  of  producing  the  most  recent  update  to  our  Program  Life
Cycle  Cost  Estimate,  to  be  included  in  our  current  budget  cycle.  Our  record  in  the
past  four  years  in  estimating  the  life  cycle  cost  of  our  deployed  modules  has  been
reasonably  good.  However,  we  are  cognizant  of  the  fact  that,  as  we  move  forward,
from  trying  to  meet  the  discrete  requirements  of  our  accounting  community,  to
meeting the requirements of highly distributed and individual organizations in pro-
gram  management,  asset  management  and  contract  management,  we  will  face  in-
creasingly complex Life Cycle Cost Estimating challenges. In this instance, past suc-
cesses are not indications of future successes.

In  conclusion,  NASA  is  again  involved  in  a  multi-year,  complex,  difficult  and  far
reaching  initiative.  In  this  instance  though,  the  objective  is  far  more  prosaic  than
what our deep space exploration or human space flight missions aim to accomplish,
but not less important. We clearly understand that, if we are to meet our long-term
goals  as  an  Agency,  we  must  continuously  improve  not  only  the  accounting  of  our
finances but the way we manage our investments, our programs and our people.

Mr. Chairmen, I would be pleased to respond to questions.

BIOGRAPHY FOR PATRICK CIGANER

Mr.  Ciganer  was  initially  asked  by  NASA  in  2001  to  help  develop  a  set  of  rec-
ommendations  for  improving  the  Financial  Management  of  the  International  Space
Station  program.  His  analysis  and  recommendations  on  Financial  Management  are
part  of  the  Young  Commission  report.  Prior  to  accepting  his  current  position  with
NASA’s Office of the Administrator in February 2002 as Special Assistant to the Ad-
ministrator  for  Financial  Management  and,  subsequently,  Program  Executive  Offi-
cer  for  the  Integrated  Enterprise  Management  Program  (IEMP),  Mr.  Ciganer  was
a  financial  executive  in  the  private  sector  where,  over  the  past  two  decades,  he  su-
pervised  and  participated  in  the  deployment  of  several  successful  Enterprise  Re-
source Planning and Financial Management information systems and organizations.
In  his  current  capacity  as  Program  Executive  Officer  for  Integrated  Enterprise
Management, Mr. Ciganer has overall responsibility for the formulation, implemen-
tation and management of the Integrated Enterprise Management Program (IEMP),
whose long-term objective is to enable NASA to operate and manage more efficiently
and transparently its major programs and initiatives.

Until accepting his current appointment in NASA’s Office of the Administrator in
early 2002, and for most of his professional career, Mr. Ciganer has been an execu-
tive  in  the  private  sector,  in  both  COO  and  CFO  positions.  Most  recently,  prior  to
moving  to  NASA,  Mr.  Ciganer  was  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  of  Mobileway  Inc.,
(Now  Mobile  365),  a  telecommunication  company  with  operations  in  the  U.S.,  Eu-
rope  and  Asia.  Over  the  past  two  decades,  he  has  held  executive  positions  in  both
private  and  public  companies  including  IWC,  Trimble  Navigation  and  Cygna  Cor-
poration.  He  started  his  career  in  at  Bank  of  America’s  where  he  was  part  of  the
Bank’s first deployment of a worldwide financial information system.

Mr.  Ciganer  did  his  undergraduate  work  in  Economics  at  Georgetown  University
and  pursued  his  Graduate  studies  in  Finance  at  San  Francisco  State  University.
Over the past fifteen years, he has been a frequent guest lecturer in financial man-
agement and advanced information systems at several organizations including Stan-
ford’s  ACE  executive  program,  Case  Western’s  Weatherhead  Graduate  School  of
Management, Golden Gate University School of Business, the U.S. Merchant Marine
Academy at King’s Point, and China’s Shanghai University.

STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT W. COBB, INSPECTOR

bers,  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  oppor-

tunity  to  discuss  NASA’s  financial  management  challenges  and
next steps.

NASA  does  not  currently  have  a  financial  system  that  can  prop-
erly  account  for  the  taxpayers’  dollars  or  support  program  man-
agers  with  accurate  financial  information  necessary  to  carry  out
their  responsibilities.  In  fiscal  years  2003  and  2004,  the  Inde-
pendent  Public  Accountant  auditing  NASA’s  financial  statements
was unable to render an opinion on those statements. The primary
reason was that NASA could not provide sufficient evidence to sup-
port the statements throughout the year and at year-end. My office,
which  hires  and  supervises  the  auditor,  expects  that  the  auditor
will  be  unable  to  render  an  opinion  on  NASA’s  fiscal  year  2005
statements for the same reason. The auditor’s report is due by No-
vember 15.

Auditor’s reports have identified material weaknesses in NASA’s
internal  controls  and  cited  instances  of  noncompliance  with  gen-
erally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  the  Federal  Financial
Management Improvement Act and the Improper Payments Act—In-
formation Act of 2002. For example, NASA does not have sufficient
controls over property, plant, and equipment, and materials, which
represents  75  percent  of  NASA  assets,  to  reasonably  assure  that
these  assets  are  properly  valued.  This  is  particularly  important
given that NASA relies on its contractors to value a significant por-
tion of government property that they hold.

NASA  does  not  have  sufficient  controls  for  ensuring  that  the
fund  balance  carried  in  its  records  reconciles  with  that  of  the
United States Treasury. The Agency could not reconcile its balance
over  the  last  couple  of  years,  and  there  are  still  unresolved  dif-
ferences.

Also,  in  fiscal  year  2003,  the  Agency  transferred  incomplete  and
inaccurate  data  to  its  integrated  financial  system,  and  in  some
cases, posted that data to wrong accounts. Now two years later, the
Agency still cannot produce auditable financial statements because
data in the integrated system continues to be incomplete and inac-
curate.

NASA  has  demonstrated  some  progress  in  addressing  material
weaknesses.  For  example,  one  material  weakness  dealing  with  the
inadequacy of information security controls over the integrated sys-
tem has been mostly resolved this year.

NASA  also  achieved  some  limited  success  in  producing  adjusted
financial  statements  from  its  Core  Financial  module.  We  are  as-
sessing the appropriateness and accuracy of the adjustments.

We  also  note  that  the  Office  of  Chief  Financial  Officer  has  filled
key  leadership  positions  and  established  a  Quality  Assurance  Of-
fice.  In  addition,  the  Center  Chief  Financial  Officers  now  report  to
the  NASA  Chief  Financial  Officer  instead  of  the  Center  directors.
NASA  has  also  made  progress  in  implementing  the  Integrated
Enterprise  Management  Program  and  is  using  several  modules  in
addition  to  the  Core  Financial  module.  However,  NASA  has  had
trouble in implementing systems that are critical for budget devel-
opment  and  property  reporting.  Specifically,  NASA  canceled  the
Budget  Formulation  module  in  November  2004  and  it  postponed
the  Integrated  Asset  Management  module,  which  was  to  be  used

for  the—to  account  for  the  Agency’s  contractor-held  assets  and
other property.

Over  the  last  3c  years  in  my  service  as  Inspector  General,  we
have  seen  the  Agency  begin  a  number  of  initiatives  to  address  its
challenges. But these plans have not been adequately developed or
put into final form. They have never gotten to a point where if you
actually  executed  the  plans  you  would  have  great  confidence  that
the material weaknesses would be resolved.

When  I  testified  before  Chairman  Platts’  Subcommittee  on  May
19,  2004,  I  noted  that  the  high-level  goals  of  the  draft  plan  as  of
that  date  appeared  to  be  appropriate  given  the  state  of  NASA’s  fi-
nancial  systems  and  underlying  records.  However,  as  the  Agency
attempted to develop details on how it would address specific weak-
nesses,  we  found  that  it  did  not  articulate  a  clear  strategy  to  re-
solve  the  weaknesses.  In  November  2004  and  in  March  and  April
of  2005,  we  recommended  that  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  articu-
late a strategy that discusses the scope of each problem, the actions
required  to  resolve  the  problem,  and  the  personnel  and  other  re-
sources that will be required.

In  addition,  we  recommended  that  the  Chief  Financial  Officer
work  with  NASA  leadership  to  get  concurrence  on  the  plan  and
present  it  to  the  Administrator  for  approval.  These  recommenda-
tions have never been implemented.

Our  continuing  efforts  to  obtain  comprehensive  corrective  action
plans  to  address  the  internal  control  deficiencies  identified  during
NASA’s  financial  statement  audits  have  largely  been  unsuccessful.
My  office,  along  with  the  Chief  Financial  Officer,  is  currently  en-
gaged  in  a  conversation  with  the  Administrator  in  identifying  the
best path forward.

I  am  encouraged  by  the  Administrator’s  lack  of  tolerance  for  the
status  quo,  a  financial  system  that  does  not  provide  proper  ac-
countability,  or  accurate  financial  information  to  program  man-
agers.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT W. COBB

Chairmen, Ranking Members, and Members of the Subcommittees:

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  financial  management  at  the  National
Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA).  The  Office  of  Inspector  General
(OIG)  has  identified  NASA’s  efforts  to  improve  financial  management  as  one  of  the
most serious management and performance challenges facing Agency leadership.

My testimony will address the specific questions in your letter of October 7, 2005,

regarding NASA’s financial management challenges and next steps.
Implementation of the Core Financial Module

Independent  Public  Accountant 

NASA  received  a  disclaimer  of  opinion  on  its  financial  statements  as  a  result  of
the 
by
PricewaterhouseCoopers and in FY 2004 by Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y); a disclaimer
of opinion is expected from E&Y again for FY 2005 because NASA has been unable
to  provide  auditable  financial  statements  and  sufficient  evidence  to  support  state-
ments throughout the fiscal year. The reports that the IPAs have submitted identify
instances of noncompliance with generally accepted accounting principles, reportable

in  FY 

2003

conditions1 (with  most  being  material  weaknesses2 )  in  internal  controls,  and  non-
compliance  with  the  Federal  Financial  Management  Improvement  Act  (FFMIA)  and
the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA). Many of the weaknesses the
audits disclosed resulted from a lack of effective internal control procedures and con-
tinued  data  integrity  issues,  as  well  as  problems  related  to  NASA’s  conversion  in
FY  2003  from  10  separate  systems  to  a  new  single  Integrated  Enterprise  Manage-
ment  Program  (IEMP).3 NASA  implemented  the  Core  Financial  module4 in  FY
2003.  Now,  two  years  later,  the  Agency  cannot  produce  auditable  financial  state-
ments because the data in the module is incomplete and inaccurate.
Persistent Internal Control Weaknesses

Internal  control  weaknesses  from  FY  2004  still  exist  today,  which  have  impacted
the FY 2005 audit, and data conversion issues have not been fully resolved. For ex-
ample,  incomplete  data  was  transferred  to  the  Core  Financial  module  and,  in  some
cases,  that  data  was  posted  to  the  wrong  accounts.  NASA’s  continued  problems  in
resolving its internal control weaknesses have contributed to its inability to produce
complete  and  accurate  financial  statements.  Many  of  NASA’s  internal  control  defi-
ciencies  are  material  weaknesses  that  have  been  reported  for  several  years,  as
shown  in  Table  1.  Two  of  the  most  significant  material  weaknesses  are  property,
plant,  and  equipment  and  materials  (PP&E)  and  Fund  Balance  with  Treasury
(FBWT).

1 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants standards define reportable conditions as
significant  deficiencies  in  the  design  or  operation  of  internal  control  that,  in  the  auditor’s  judg-
ment, could adversely affect the entity’s ability to record, process, summarize, and report finan-
cial data consistent with the assertions of management in the financial statements.

2 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants standards define a material weakness as
a  reportable  condition  in  which  the  design  or  operation  of  one  or  more  of  the  internal  control
components does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that misstatements caused by error
or fraud in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial statements being audited
may occur and not be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of per-
forming their assigned functions.

3 IEMP was previously referred to as the Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP).

The IEMP processes NASA’s significant financial applications.

4 The  Core  Financial  module  consists  of  the  standard  general  ledger,  accounts  receivable,  ac-

counts payable, purchasing, cost management, and general systems management.

Inadequate Corrective Action Plans

The  Agency  has  not  been  able  to  articulate  with  clarity  comprehensive  action
plans for how it will address its internal control weaknesses or its financial manage-
ment  problems.  Over  the  past  three  and  one  half  years,  the  Agency  has  attempted
to  develop  several  corrective  action  plans  to  correct  the  identified  weaknesses,  but
those  plans  have  not  outlined  a  clear  strategy  for  resolving  those  weaknesses,  nor
have  they  been  put  into  final  form.  My  office  continues  to  work  with  the  Office  of
the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), as it has for the past three and one half years,
toward  solutions.  NASA  must  solve  these  issues  by  coordinating  and  implementing
corrective action plans that are the product of NASA program and institutional lead-
ership,  within  parameters  set  by  financial  management  and  accounting  laws  and
regulations. The plans must be detailed enough to ensure successful implementation
with desired results.

You have asked:

• What  progress  has  NASA  made  in  addressing  the  financial  management

challenges identified in the audit reports from the past two years?
NASA has demonstrated some limited progress in addressing three of its four re-
ported  material  weaknesses  and  one  reportable  condition  from  the  FY  2004  audit.
NASA has made significant progress in correcting the fourth material weakness re-
ported  by  E&Y  in  FY  2004,  ‘‘Improvements  in  the  IFMP  Control  Environment’’  (in-
cluded as part of the General Controls Environment shown in Table 1).

NASA  also  achieved  some  limited  success  in  producing  interim  financial  state-
ments  from  its  Core  Financial  module,  although  many  manual  adjustments  were
still  necessary.  NASA  generated  its  year-end  financial  statements  directly  from  the
Core  Financial  module.  It  accomplished  this  by  posting  adjustments  in  the  module,
rather  than  manually  adjusting  the  financial  statements.  We  are  assessing  the  ap-
propriateness and accuracy of those posted adjustments. Other areas of progress in-
clude the implementation of reconciliation procedures for selected general ledger ac-
counts  and  preparing  checklists  for  Centers  to  complete  and  sign  to  certify  the
transactions. We also note that the OCFO has added additional personnel, filled key

leadership positions, and established a Quality Assurance office. The Quality Assur-
ance  office  has  the  responsibility  of  providing  oversight  and  quality  control  reviews
of financial management and assisting the Centers with compliance issues. In addi-
tion,  the  Center  Chief  Financial  Officers  now  report  to  the  NASA  Chief  Financial
Officer instead of the Center directors.

.

NASA also made some progress on the material weakness in ‘‘Property, Plant, and
Equipment  and  Materials’’  by  developing  an  Internet-based  Contractor  Held  Asset
Tracking System (CHATS) for contractors to report information on their contractor-
held, NASA-owned property.

tion procedures;
NASA’s  procedures  for  preparing  financial  statements  have  improved  since  the
preparation  of  the  FY  2004  statements.  Specifically,  the  OCFO  implemented  a
checklist  for  completing  the  statements,  supervisory  reviews  of  the  statements  are
now  documented,  and  an  analysis  for  each  line  item  is  now  prepared  to  ensure  ad-
justments are made when required.

For  the  three  interim  (quarterly)  reporting  periods  during  FY  2005,  the  OCFO
produced its quarterly financial statements from the Core Financial module but had
to  make  many  high  dollar-value  line  item  adjustments.  Those  adjustments  had  to
be made because of data integrity and configuration issues with the Core Financial
module. For example, ‘‘unexpended appropriations’’ was decreased by $1.157 billion;
‘‘cumulative result of operation’’ was increased by $626 million; and ‘‘appropriations
received’’ was decreased by $296 million.

Based  on  reviews  by  E&Y  and  my  office  of  the  first,  second,  and  third  quarter
statements, the Balance Sheet from the Core Financial module did not balance (i.e.,
assets  do  not  equal  liabilities  plus  equity).  In  addition,  E&Y  could  not  always  find
an audit trail from the Core Financial module general ledger accounts to the finan-
cial statements. NASA needs to consistently ensure that the general ledger accounts
are properly mapped to the financial statements and adjustments are properly sup-
ported.  Also,  Statement  of  Federal  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFFAS)  No.  4,
Managerial  Cost  Accounting  Concepts  and  Standards  for  the  Federal  Government,
requires  that  financial  reporting  meet  the  objective  of  providing  program  managers
with relevant and reliable information related to program costs. However, the OCFO
does not report net costs by mission directorate.
Subsidiary Account Ledgers. During FY 2004, E&Y found that the OCFO could not
routinely  provide  listings  of  subsidiary  balances  to  support  accounts  receivable,  ac-
counts payable, and undelivered orders, as well as cash receipts and cash disburse-
ments.  These  problems  have  not  been  fully  resolved  during  the  FY  2005  audit.  In
order  for  E&Y  to  test  the  account  balances,  NASA  had  to  create  reports  from  the
subsidiary ledgers for accounts receivable, accounts payable, and undelivered orders.
Once E&Y auditors started testing the sample account balances from those prepared
reports,  they  noted  that  the  subsidiary  ledgers  did  not  have  running  balances,  but
were just a list of actual transactions. As a result of receiving transaction data and
not  balances,  E&Y  had  to  redesign  its  testing  procedures  to  recreate  the  account
balances. In addition, when E&Y tried to test the account balances for cash receipts
and  cash  disbursements,  it  determined  that  those  accounts  contained  prior-year
transactions.  Those  prior-year  transactions  had  been  included  in  reports  to  the
Treasury covering FY 2005 activity.
Adjustments  and  Corrections.  PricewaterhouseCoopers  found  that  the  Core  Finan-
cial  module  does  not  allow  the  OCFO  to  identify,  differentiate,  and  track  non-rou-
tine and corrected transactions from original transactions or prior-year transactions
(e.g.,  prior-period  adjustments).  During  FY  2005,  NASA  made  adjustments  in  its
current-year  financial  data  to  correct  errors  from  the  FY  2003  data  conversion.  It
is  important  for  the  auditors,  as  well  as  the  OCFO,  to  quantify  the  dollar  impact
of  prior-period  adjustments  because  the  financial  statements  should  only  represent
current-year activity. At the present time, this cannot be done in the Core Financial
module.

Prior to the preparation of the FY 2005 year-end financial statements, thousands
of  adjustments  were  recorded  outside  the  Core  Financial  module  to  address  data
conversion  errors.  The  manner  in  which  the  Agency  corrects  those  errors  loses  the
audit trail. Specifically, to record the adjustments within the Core Financial module,
users  deleted  the  incorrect  transaction  completely  and  entered  the  correct  trans-
action in its place. The needed solution is reversing the incorrect entry and entering
the correction (which would leave an audit trail).

.

• Specifically,  address  each  of  the  following  areas  identified  in  previous

.including inconsistent procedures among NASA Centers;

audits: .
E&Y’s internal controls testing at NASA Centers during FY 2005 determined that
the Centers have various work-around procedures, which are outside of normal, es-
tablished accounting procedures. For example, one Center had its own tracking sys-
tem to ensure compliance with the Prompt Payment Act, while another Center used
the Core Financial module for that purpose.

To improve its financial practices, NASA created standardized Financial Manage-
ment  Requirements  (FMRs),  which  are  designed  to  enable  consistent  financial  poli-
cies,  processes,  and  data  management  among  NASA  Headquarters  and  its  Centers.
NASA  has  released  13  FMRs  since  September  2004.  NASA  released  eight  FMRs  at
the end of FY 2004 and five during FY 2005. These FMRs include policies and pro-
cedures applicable to such critical financial management processes as budget execu-
tion,  accounting,  external  reporting,  internal  management  controls,  and  periodic
monitoring of controls and activities. We have not assessed whether the FMRs com-
ply with accounting principles and practices.

.

The OCFO’s Quality Assurance office completed quality assistance visits to NASA
Centers and at Headquarters in September 2005. The visits focused on determining
the  adequacy  of  compliance  at  Centers  and  affected  Headquarters  organizations,  to
include  compliance  with  NASA’s  FMRs.  The  visits  were  also  an  opportunity  for  the
Quality Assurance office to assist with any questions or concerns in identifying and
improving  financial  management  practices  and  internal  controls  and  to  assess  the
current  financial  management  control  structure.  We  are  awaiting  the  results  of
these visits. All indications from discussions with the personnel who made the visits
is  that,  if  they  had  to  provide  a  red,  yellow,  or  green  rating,  most  Centers  would
receive  a  yellow  rating.  My  office  has  not  assessed  the  quality  assurance  process,
but we note that the office is understaffed and has been required to fulfill multiple
obligations beyond quality assurance.
• Specifically,  address  each  of  the  following  areas  identified  in  previous

.discrepancies in Fund Balance with Treasury;

audits: .
NASA  still  has  unresolved  discrepancies  with  its  FBWT.  As  of  September  30,
2005,  NASA’s  FBWT  account  was  $59  million  higher  than  Treasury’s  balance.  This
figure  is  a  net  number.  The  absolute  value  of  the  difference  is  $1.13  billion  when
you add together the differences, at the Center level, of ‘‘Application of Funds.’’ E&Y
is  currently  reviewing  the  reconciliation  and  the  underlying  information.  E&Y’s
audit  of  NASA’s  FY  2004  financial  statements  also  found  differences  between  the
two fund balances.

The  FY  2003  audit  report  from  PricewaterhouseCoopers  found  that  NASA  posted
year-end adjustments of approximately $1.743 billion to decrease the Core Financial
module’s  balance  to  that  of  the  Treasury’s  balance.  Those  year-end  adjustments  to
the FBWT account were not recorded in the Core Financial module.

On  March  24,  2005,  we  issued  a  memorandum  to  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  ad-
dressing NASA’s corrections of approximately $1.598 billion of the net $1.743 billion
discrepancy  in  the  FY  2003  FBWT.  Our  work  on  the  FBWT  through  March  2005
led  us  to  conclude  that  the  remaining  amount  of  net  adjustments  to  be  corrected
was  $144  million.  It  should  be  noted  that  while  the  net  amount  was  $144  million,
the absolute value of those adjustments (when increases and decreases to the FBWT
account  are  added  together)  was  $7.018  billion.  Table  2,  which  we  included  in  the
memorandum  to  the  Chief  Financial  Officer,  shows  the  absolute  and  net  values  of
the  adjustments,  the  amounts  of  OCFO  corrections,  and  the  amounts  we  verified.

On May 31, 2005, the OCFO issued comprehensive, Agency-wide FBWT reconcili-
ation  procedures  to  each  Center  to  ensure  that  monthly  reviews  and  correction  of
data would be consistent across all Centers. We believe those procedures will ensure
consistency and also readily identify differences to be resolved. The OCFO’s Quality
Assurance  office  has  been  conducting  on-site  quality  assistance  reviews  of  Center
compliance  with  the  new  procedures.  We  anticipate  reviewing  those  results  when
they are finalized.

As of September 30, 2005, the OCFO reported that the remaining FY 2003 adjust-
ments requiring correction totaled a net of $23 million, meaning NASA’s FBWT ac-
count  was  still  $23  million  higher  than  what  Treasury  reported.  While  this  is  sig-
nificant  progress  from  March  2005,  when  we  reported  a  net  of  $144  million  adjust-
ments  remaining  in  the  ‘‘Other  Reconciling  Items’’  category,  we  have  not  yet  had
an  opportunity  to  validate  the  corrections  made.  Preliminary  documentation  pro-
vided by the OCFO does not provide sufficient competent evidence. For example, the
$144  million  we  reported  comprised  three  journal  vouchers  posted  outside  of  the
Core Financial module at the end of FY 2003. Our initial review of OCFO’s analysis
to  support  the  $23  million  does  not  show  that  those  vouchers  have  been  corrected
in the system.
• Specifically,  address  each  of  the  following  areas  identified  in  previous
audits:  .
.controls  over  Property,  Plant,  and  Equipment  and  Materials;
For the last three years, internal controls over PP&E has been identified as a ma-
terial  weakness.  PP&E  totals  approximately  $34.6  billion  and  comprises  more  than
75 percent of NASA’s assets. The reported weaknesses were due primarily to a lack
of  PP&E  capitalization  policy  and  NASA’s  reliance  on  contractors  to  value  property
they hold.

.

NASA  had  hoped  that  the  implementation  of  the  Integrated  Asset  Management
(IAM) module would serve as a cornerstone to the resolution of NASA property prob-
lems. However, in June 2005, NASA postponed the implementation of the IAM mod-
ule pending architectural review.
Lack  of  PP&E  Capitalization  Policy.  Over  the  past  two  fiscal  years  (FYs  2003  and
2004),  auditors  have  recommended  that  NASA  implement  a  formal  capitalization
policy  for  property.  The  Agency  has  implemented  a  number  of  initiatives  to  deal
with  issues  concerning  PP&E,  but  it  has  not  articulated  what  the  elements  of  a
properly  working  property  management  and  accounting  system  would  involve.  The
internal control report from the FY 2004 audit articulates what NASA needs to do:
NASA’s  approach  to  recognizing  and  accounting  for  fixed  assets  is  heavily  de-
pendent  on  activities  at  its  contractors,  and  subsequent  reviews  to  determine
amounts  that  should  be  capitalized.  Currently,  NASA  expenses  all  costs  and
then  performs  a  review  of  the  transactions  to  determine  which  costs  should  be
capitalized.  The  subsequent  review  and  dependence  on  contractor  reporting  in-
creases the risk that costs will not be properly capitalized. Until NASA success-
fully implements a single integrated system for reporting property, and develops
a  methodology  to  identify  costs  that  need  to  be  capitalized  as  the  transaction
is  processed,  the  Agency  will  continue  to  experience  difficulties  in  recording
these transactions.

This  is  the  heart  of  the  findings  of  material  weaknesses  in  accounting  for  PP&E
identified in the past several financial statement audits. Fundamentally, NASA has
not  yet  addressed  the  problem.  For  example,  NASA  has  not  established  a  system
that  relies  on  the  Agency’s  personnel,  not  contractors,  to  establish  what  costs  are
capitalized and expensed as the dollars on a particular contract are spent.

As  part  of  NASA’s  ongoing  efforts  to  address  the  capitalization  issue,  the  OCFO
put  out  a  white  paper  in  September  2005  with  an  analysis  of  theme  assets  and  a
proposed  capitalization  policy  for  theme  assets.  While  dialogues  continue  between
my  office  and  the  OCFO  regarding  the  analysis  and  proposed  policy,  theme  asset
capitalization  is  just  one  component  of  the  overall  property  capitalization  problem
reported  over  the  years.  Therefore,  NASA’s  focus  on  implementing  capitalization
policy  for  theme  assets  by  itself  does  not  adequately  address  the  PP&E  weakness
articulated in the FY 2004 report.
Lack  of  NASA  Validation  of  Contractor-Held  PP&E.  In  both  the  FY  2004  and  the
FY  2003  financial  statement  audits,  NASA  validation  of  information  provided  by
contractors  concerning  contractor-held  PP&E  was  cited  as  a  weakness.  At  the  time
of  those  audits,  NASA  contractors  periodically  reported  PP&E  values  to  NASA
manually on a spreadsheet called NASA Form 1018, a process that the IPAs stated
was  prone  to  error.  At  a  minimum,  they  recommended  that  NASA  ensure  that  all
of  its  contractors  have  formal  policies  and  procedures  in  place  to  detect  and  correct

errors  in  PP&E  values  the  contractors  report  to  NASA.  During  E&Y’s  FY  2004
audit,  it  found  a  $300  million  computational  error  in  the  NASA  Form  1018s.  The
error,  which  was  discovered  by  neither  the  contractors  nor  NASA’s  validation  proc-
ess, highlights the control weaknesses in this area.

To  address  the  problem,  NASA  automated  its  contractor  PP&E  reporting  process
in  FY  2005  by  implementing  CHATS.  While  replacing  the  manual  process  with  an
automated one is a step in the right direction, data is still entered manually because
CHATS  does  not  interface  with  the  contractors’  systems.  Therefore,  we  do  not  be-
lieve  that  CHATS  decreases  the  risk  of  errors.  Further,  PP&E  data  can  be  entered
by a single contractor representative, and there appears to be no evidence of super-
visory review of the PP&E reporting process at the contractors.

.

NASA’s  approach  to  the  PP&E  validation  process  was  to  decentralize  it  by  shift-
ing  validation  responsibilities  to  the  NASA  Centers.  NASA  stated  that  decen-
tralizing the validation responsibilities allows NASA Headquarters to focus more ef-
fectively  on  conducting  oversight  of  the  process.  NASA  now  holds  regularly  sched-
uled  teleconferences  with  property  accountants  at  various  NASA  Centers  and  con-
tractors  to  discuss  the  status  of  the  corrective  actions  taken  to  resolve  previously
reported  deficiencies.  The  periodic  teleconferences  will  help  NASA  resolve  some  of
the  problems.  However,  decentralizing  the  PP&E  validation  process  requires  effec-
tive oversight by NASA Headquarters and a strong internal control environment at
the Centers. As NASA’s control weakness in this area is persistent, it is imperative
that  NASA  Headquarters  develop  a  strategic  plan  for  how  effective  oversight  will
be  accomplished.  We  also  note  that  there  are  two  reporting  systems  for  contractor-
held  assets  that  are  not  being  reconciled  (CHATS  and  NASA  Form  533s,  used  by
contractors to report project costs as costs are being incurred).

Also,  in  FY  2004,  NASA  developed  procedures  to  address  the  contractor-held
PP&E deficiency, including risk assessment of various contractors to be used by the
Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) in reviewing contractor-held property for its
FY  2005  audit.  NASA  is  relying  on  the  results  of  DCAA’s  work  to  provide  a  review
of contractors’ corrective action plans for previously reported deficiencies. E&Y is in
the process of reviewing that work.
• Specifically,  address  each  of  the  following  areas  identified  in  previous

.controls over estimating NASA’s environmental liability.

audits: .
NASA’s environmental liabilities totaled $986 million in FY 2004. E&Y identified
NASA’s  ability  to  generate  an  auditable  estimate  of  its  unfunded  environmental  li-
abilities  as  a  weakness  during  E&Y’s  FY  2004  audit  of  those  liabilities  and  related
financial  statement  disclosures.  The  reportable  condition  occurred  because  of  four
problem  areas  in  NASA’s  estimation  process:  roles  and  responsibilities;  training;
documentation; and quality assurance procedures.
Roles and Responsibilities. During the FY 2004 audit, E&Y noted that roles and re-
sponsibilities for the estimation of unfunded environmental liabilities were not suffi-
ciently defined to ensure appropriate integration and input into the estimation proc-
ess.  Specifically,  NASA’s  accounting  function  deferred  to  the  Environmental  Man-
agement  Division  for  preparing  estimates.  As  a  result,  environmental  professionals
were interpreting accounting requirements. During E&Y’s testing of FY 2005 inter-
nal  controls  over  the  environmental  estimation  process,  the  auditors  noted  that
OCFO representatives were present at Centers during some portions of the environ-
mental  liability  estimation  process,  but  that  their  role  was  limited  to  that  of  audit
liaison.  The  OCFO  still  has  not  taken  on  the  role  as  the  principal  accounting  deci-
sion-maker in the environmental liability estimation process.
Training.  In  FY  2004,  E&Y  reported  that  NASA  personnel  and  its  contractors  had
not  received  sufficient  training  in  the  process  for  estimating  environmental  liabil-
ities.  Although  NASA  released  a  handbook  on  environmental  cost  restoration  in
June  2004  to  provide  guidance  to  the  NASA  Centers,  the  handbook  is  not  detailed
enough to produce auditable estimates. In June 2005, NASA’s Environmental Man-
agement  Division  conducted  estimation  training  and  invited  OCFO  participation,
but OCFO employees did not attend. While that training is a step in the right direc-
tion, joint training needs to be held that addresses detailed estimation processes and
requirements to produce auditable estimates. E&Y noted that the training left Cen-
ter  estimators  with  many  unanswered  questions  regarding  the  estimation  process.
Documentation.  E&Y  reported  during  FY  2004  that  NASA  did  not  have  adequate,
auditable  documentation  to  support  its  FY  2004  environmental  liability  estimates.
NASA  developed  a  corrective  action  plan  for  the  environmental  liability  estimation
weakness,  but  did  not  submit  it  to  E&Y  until  late  in  FY  2005.  E&Y  testing  for  the
FY  2005  audit  indicates  that  the  OCFO  is  still  not  able  to  provide  sufficient  docu-

mentation.  In  addition,  E&Y  noted  that  the  Environmental  Management  Division
was not in agreement with some of E&Y’s findings, which could further delay imple-
mentation  of  corrective  actions.  Until  such  actions  are  taken,  NASA  will  not  be  in
a position to provide documentation that will stand audit scrutiny.
Quality Assurance Procedures. E&Y reported in FY 2004 that NASA did not conduct
formal,  independent  quality  reviews  of  the  Centers’  environmental  liability  esti-
mates  before  including  the  estimates  in  NASA  financial  statements.  In  FY  2005,
NASA  created  an  advocate  role  at  each  of  the  Centers  to  review  estimates  before
including  them  in  the  financial  statements.  Although  NASA  is  not  conducting  for-
mal, independent quality reviews, E&Y stated that the creation of an advocate role
is a positive step forward; however, that advocate role must be staffed appropriately,
and  procedures  and  requirements  for  the  review,  including  formal  documentation,
must be implemented.
• What financial management challenges remain?

There are three basic requirements for sound financial management: (1) financial
statement amounts are obtained from the financial management system and adjust-
ments  outside  of  the  system  are  generally  limited,  (2)  financial  statement  amounts
agree  with  the  general  ledger  trial  balance,  and  (3)  detailed  transactions  are  main-
tained  in  subsidiary  ledgers  that  agree  with  the  amounts  reported  on  the  financial
statements.  NASA’s  financial  management  system,  specifically  the  Core  Financial
module,  does  not  meet  those  requirements.  The  outlook  for  future  financial  state-
ment  audits  is  highly  dependent  on  whether  an  IPA  can  rely  on  NASA’s  system  of
internal  controls,  NASA’s  ability  to  generate  complete  and  accurate  financial  state-
ments  from  its  Core  Financial  module,  and  NASA’s  ability  to  provide  a  clear  and
accurate audit trail. In addition, establishing reliable internal controls will be a par-
ticular  challenge  with  respect  to  NASA-owned,  contractor-held  assets,  a  significant
Balance Sheet item. Data integrity is an issue for both challenges.
• What are the underlying causes of these challenges?

E&Y  found  that  NASA’s  financial  records  continued  to  be  plagued  with  data  in-
tegrity issues, which adversely affected NASA’s ability to prepare accurate financial
statements  for  FY  2005.  NASA  made  adjustments  to  the  interim  financial  state-
ments  outside  of  the  system  to  arrive  at  the  amounts  reported  externally  on  the  fi-
nancial  statements  either  because  of  continuing  data  integrity  issues  related  to
NASA’s conversion in FY 2003 from 10 separate systems to a new single system or
because current-year transactions were not properly processed.

The following are some examples of problems that have been identified during the

FY 2005 audit:

• SAP5 functionality creates inappropriate transaction postings in some account
balances.  For  example,  during  the  third  quarter  of  FY  2005,  NASA  reported
that  accounts  payable  balances  existed  that  were  considered  invalid  because
they related to canceled appropriations.

• SAP  could  not  distinguish  between  current-year  transactions  and  corrections

to prior-year transactions posted in the current year.

• During  reporting  for  the  third  quarter  of  FY  2005,  amounts  reported  for  fi-
nancial  statement  line  items  had  to  be  manually  adjusted  to  arrive  at  the
amounts NASA reported to the Office of Management and Budget. For exam-
ple,  ‘‘unexpended  appropriations’’  was  decreased  by  $1.157  billion;  ‘‘cumu-
lative result of operation’’ was increased by $626 million; and ‘‘appropriations
received’’  was  decreased  by  $296  million.  NASA  indicated  that  the  adjust-
ments  were  due  to  corrections  posted  in  the  current  year  in  an  effort  to  re-
solve data integrity issues from prior years.

• The  SAP  configuration  for  NASA’s  Core  Financial  module  does  not  capture
all relevant information for financial reporting. For example, the OCFO stat-
ed that information relating to recovery of prior-year obligations (upward and
downward  obligation  adjustments)  is  not  routinely  isolated  in  SAP-produced
reports.

These  financial  management  system  deficiencies  will  result  in  E&Y’s  inability  to
determine whether NASA’s financial statements are fairly stated in all material as-
pects.

and Education, Inc., is referred to as SAP.

• How  will  the  new  requirements  levied  in  Office  of  Management  Budget
‘‘Management’s  Responsibility  for  Internal  Control’’

Circular  A–123, 
present new challenges to NASA’s financial management efforts?
Given  that  NASA  has  three  multi-year  repeat  weaknesses  in  internal  controls,  it
will have difficulty in meeting documentation requirements under the revised OMB
Circular  A–123,  Management’s  Responsibility  for  Internal  Control,  dated  December
21, 2004. We noted three new, specific requirements in the OMB Circular: (1) docu-
menting the Agency’s understanding of its internal controls over financial reporting;
(2) documenting the assessment process of internal controls, which align with man-
agement’s assertions for each account or group of accounts over financial reporting;
and  (3)  documenting  the  tests  of  operating  effectiveness  of  controls  whose  design  is
deemed  effective  or  moderately  effective.  These  new  requirements  must  be  met
starting in FY 2006.

The key message underlying the three requirements is documentation. Competent
and  sufficient  documentation  supporting  NASA’s  financial  statements  is  required
but  continues  to  be  a  challenge  for  NASA,  judging  by  the  delay  E&Y  experienced
in  obtaining  updates  from  NASA  on  E&Y’s  previous  year’s  ‘‘cycle  memorandums.’’
Cycle  memorandums  document  the  auditor’s  understanding  of  the  key  processes
surrounding  financial  transactions.  It  provides  the  policies  regulating  the  process,
the procedures followed in the process, and the types of internal control procedures
present  and  in  operation  throughout  the  Agency.  In  order  for  NASA  to  meet  the
OMB  Circular’s  FY  2006  requirements,  NASA  must  meet  the  challenge  of  docu-
menting its own understanding of controls over financial reporting.
• What  progress  has  NASA  made  in  implementing  an  integrated  financial

management system?
NASA  continues  to  make  progress  in  implementing  IEMP.  The  Agency  has  com-
pleted implementation of several modules in addition to the Core Financial module:

nouncements to the Office of Personnel Management (October 2005); and

partment of Interior (August 2004);

calculating and allocating labor costs (October 2005).

Most  recently,  on  October  18,  2005,  NASA  implemented  Phase  I  of  Project  Man-
agement  Information  Improvement  (PMI2).  PMI2 is  a  data  management  process—
the  result  of  a  study  to  develop  an  approach  and  strategy  to  expand  the
functionality  of  NASA’s  Core  Financial  module.  The  purpose  of  PMI2 is  to  improve
project  information  management  by  aligning  both  technical  and  financial  work
breakdown structures, allowing a single data management structure. Such an align-
ment  is  needed  for  managers  to  exercise  sound  financial  management  of  their  pro-
grams  and  projects.  My  office  is  in  the  process  of  reviewing  the  implementation  of
PMI2 Phase I. During our review, we found that NASA had not adequately commu-
nicated the changes that would result from PMI2 Phase I and the benefits resulting
from  those  changes.  In  addition,  the  PMI2 Project  Office  had  not  provided  Head-
quarters  and  the  Centers  with  clear  and  definitive  implementation  steps  and  mile-
stones to be met. In a September 2005 memorandum, we made several recommenda-
tions  to  the  OCFO  to  correct  these  problems.  In  response  to  our  memorandum,  the
NASA  Administrator  sent  an  ‘‘all  hands’’  e-mail  stressing  the  importance  of  PMI2
and providing additional information on communications and training events. While
this  has  been  a  high-risk  implementation,  we  believe  that  it  has  been  successful
thus far.

However, NASA has experienced some difficulty in implementing systems that are
critical for budget development, financial reporting, and full-cost management. Spe-
cifically,  the  Budget  Formulation  module  was  canceled  in  November  2004  because

6 In  March  2007,  NASA  plans  to  replace  Travel  Manager  with  E-Travel,  which  is  part  of  the

President’s E-Gov initiatives and is the General Services Administration’s vendor for travel.

44

the  NASA  OCFO  determined  that  the  module  no  longer  met  the  Agency’s  budget
requirements. We noted in our March 2004 audit report on the Budget Formulation
module7 that its development did not include the input of critical users, the module
experienced  significant  processing  performance  problems,  and  the  module  initially
did  not  include  five  key  system  requirements.8 In  addition,  implementation  of  the
IAM  module,  which  was  to  be  used  to  account  for  the  Agency’s  contractor-held  as-
sets  and  its  PP&E,  was  postponed  pending  architectural  review.  Currently,  NASA
must account for its contractor-held assets using alternative methods outside of the
IEMP. The last three financial statement audits have reported material weaknesses
in internal controls over contractor-held property.

One of NASA’s most significant planned developments is the SAP Version Update
(SVU).  During  FY  2005,  NASA  was  informed  by  SAP’s  manufacturer  that  it  would
no  longer  be  supporting  SAP  version  4.6c,  implemented  by  NASA  in  FY  2003,  and
that NASA would have to upgrade its financial management system. NASA initiated
its  SVU  project  in  September  2005  to  manage  the  implementation  of  the  upgrade.
The  implementation  will  occur  as  part  of  the  Competency  Center  Release  Manage-
ment process next October for an FY 2007 startup.

According  to  the  IEMP  Program  Office,  the  SVU  should  deliver  enhanced

functionality to the existing Core Financial module, including:

tribution,

• improved data integrity based on SAP Funds Management redesign,
• improved processes for reducing errors and mispostings,
• additional automation of adjustment accounting entries,
• improvements to the budget distribution process,
• analysis  and  potential  redesign  of  lower  level  funds  control  and  funds  dis-
• addressing  program/project  management  needs  by  modifying  business  proc-
esses and systems architecture to unbundle management reporting from gen-
eral ledger accounting through analytical staff and data warehouse configura-
tion, and
• streamlined  year-end  processing  starting  with  FY  2007  year-end  processing.
Collectively,  these  improvements,  if  realized  through  the  SVU,  should  contribute
to  improving  NASA’s  financial  tracking  and  reporting.  To  ensure  that  the  SVU
project  is  successful,  an  effective  project  governance  structure  and  process  must  be
established  that  will  integrate  and  prioritize  the  diverse  requirements  that  will  be
levied on the project through the active participation and commitment of key stake-
holders. We have initiated a review to determine whether NASA has established an
effective project governance structure and process to manage the SVU.

In June 2005, the NASA Administrator directed the re-baselining of IEMP, which
included renaming the program (from IFMP), reworking schedules, and revising the
funding source. The most dramatic impact on IEMP as a result of the re-baselining
was  the  change  in  funding  source  from  multiple  Headquarters  and  Center  general
and administrative overhead accounts to a single program line item, effective for FY
2006.  That  change  resulted  in  the  IEMP  Program  Office  developing  new  business
processes for budget execution. The use of one funding source should ultimately re-
sult  in  a  more  accurate  accounting  of  the  full  cost  of  IEMP  because  it  consolidates
all  costs,  regardless  of  which  Center  incurred  them,  into  one  budget  line  item.  The
FY 2006 budget for IEMP showed that the total estimated program cost for develop-
ment and implementation of all IEMP modules was about $746 million for FY 2000
through FY 2010. However, that did not include the costs for Center implementation
or annual system maintenance. We were told that the FY 2007 budget request con-
solidates  all  known  IEMP  costs,  including  Center  implementation  costs,  into  one
program line item.
• How  have  the  problems  with  the  financial  management  system  affected

the Agency’s ability to effectively manage its programs?
Until NASA has a fully operational and integrated financial management system,
it  will  not  be  able  to  address  its  longstanding  financial  management  practice  and
business  process  issues.  IEMP  in  its  current  state  will  not  routinely  provide  pro-

7 ‘‘Integrated  Financial  Management  Program  Budget  Formulation  Module  (BFM)’’  (IG–04–

017, March 30, 2004).

8 The  requirements  were  (1)  data  integrity  business  checks  that  would  ensure  that  budget
planners  do  not  assign  the  wrong  appropriation  to  a  project,  (2)  full  system  traceability  (audit
trail),  (3)  restricted  access  to  embargoed  budget  data,  (4)  acceptable  system  response  time,  and
(5)  an  online  quick  reference  tool.  Those  five  key  system  requirements  were  critical  to  Center
program and project staff in developing their bottom-up budget data.

gram  managers  and  other  key  stakeholders  and  decision-makers—including  the
Congress—with the financial-related information needed to estimate costs, measure
program  performance,  and  ensure  accountability.  For  example,  the  Core  Financial
module does not appropriately capture PP&E or transaction-level information in its
general ledger, which is needed to provide independent control over these assets. As
a  result,  program  managers  and  cost  estimators  continue  to  use  systems  outside  of
IEMP  and  other  labor-intensive  means  to  capture  the  data  they  need  to  manage
their programs.

The Government Accountability Office previously reported that the Core Financial
module  does  not  comply  with  the  objectives  of  the  Statement  of  Federal  Financial
Accounting  Standards  (SFFAS)  No.  4,  Managerial  Cost  Accounting  Concepts  and
Standards  for  the  Federal  Government.  SFFAS  No.  4  is  aimed  at  achieving  three
general objectives: (1) providing program managers with relevant and reliable infor-
mation  relating  costs  to  program  outputs,  (2)  providing  relevant  and  reliable  cost
information  to  assist  the  Congress  and  executives  in  making  decisions  about  allo-
cating federal resources and evaluating program performance, and (3) ensuring con-
sistency  between  costs  reported  in  general  purpose  financial  reports  and  costs  re-
ported to program managers. Because this information is not available through the
Core  Financial  module,  program  managers  will  continue  to  rely  on  hard-copy  re-
ports,  electronic  spreadsheets,  or  other  means  to  monitor  contractor  performance.
Consequently,  NASA  risks  operating  with  two  sets  of  books-one  that  is  used  to  re-
port information in the Agency’s general-purpose financial reports and another that
is used by program managers to run NASA’s projects and programs.

Finally, until the Core Financial module is operating properly, the Agency will ex-
perience internal control deficiencies in its financial accounting procedures that will
increase the likelihood of errors and irregularities. During its FY 2005 testing, E&Y
auditors  found  that  duties  were  not  adequately  segregated  for  some  Core  Financial
module  users.  For  example,  some  users  were  given  one  role  to  create  or  maintain
purchase  orders  and  another  role  to  enter  vendor  invoices.  The  effect  of  allowing  a
user  those  dual  roles  could  be  that  a  single  person  could  authorize  both  the  pur-
chase and the payment for that purchase.
• What  does  NASA  need  to  do  to  address  its  remaining  financial  manage-

ment deficiencies, including staffing, budget, etc.?
At the beginning of FY 2005, the OCFO was authorized to maintain a level of 121
staff  members.  NASA  reduced  this  to  103  positions  by  March  31,  2005.  In  June
2005, the Administrator authorized additional resources to the OCFO to ensure that
NASA  is  adequately  staffed  to  improve  financial  management  and  reporting  capa-
bilities.  The  total  OCFO  ceiling  of  authorized  positions  at  the  end  of  FY  2005  was
132. In October 2005, NASA completed an Institutional Requirements Review of the
Headquarters  workforce  requested  by  the  Administrator  to  assess  consistency  of
Headquarters staffing with the Agency’s revised strategic direction. The review rec-
ommended  setting  the  OCFO  ceiling  at  103.  NASA  has  a  reclama  process  that  will
allow each area to request a ceiling adjustment, and the Chief Financial Officer has
stated that the reduction levied on the OCFO will severely affect its ability to meet
the Administrator’s goal to improve financial management.
• What  areas  of  NASA’s  current  corrective  action  plan  need  increased  at-

tention?
In  order  for  NASA  to  address  its  financial  management  problems,  it  will  need  to
articulate  a  strategy  that  addresses  both  the  problem—the  financial  management
system and the resulting internal control weaknesses causing the recording and re-
porting  of  inaccurate  and  incomplete  data  to  the  financial  statements—and  the  ac-
tions  required  to  resolve  those  problems,  including  the  personnel  and  other  re-
sources  needed  to  fix  the  problems.  Once  the  corrective  action  plans  have  been  de-
veloped,  approved,  and  implemented,  our  IPAs  will  need  to  test  those  plans  to  en-
sure Agency compliance.

In  FY  2003,  NASA  management  prepared  a  NASA  Financial  Management  Im-
provement  Plan.  I  reported  last  year9 that  the  plan  appeared  to  be  designed  to  im-
prove  the  organization  of  the  OCFO  and  to  improve  financial  policies  and  proce-
dures. One purpose of that plan was to provide a detailed framework for correcting
the  deficiencies  identified  during  the  financial  statement  audits  in  order  to  achieve
an  audit  opinion.  Since  then,  that  plan  has  gone  through  several  draft  iterations
and is now referred to as the Financial Leadership Plan (FLP). The draft FLP estab-
lishes  goals,  priorities,  and  supporting  initiatives  for  improving  overall  financial

management  within  the  Agency.  According  to  OCFO  personnel,  the  FLP  will  be
used  to  isolate  and  monitor  progress  on  specific  areas  targeted  for  improvement  in
financial  management  and  includes  specific  strategic  initiatives.  NASA  has  already
started to integrate some of those initiatives with other related activities, including
NASA’s  IEMP  project  milestones.  However,  my  office  reported  in  November  2004,
in March 2005, and in April 2005, that the plan does not appear to:

• articulate a strategy that discusses the scope of each problem, the actions re-
quired to resolve the problem, and the personnel and other resources that will
be required;
• ensure  that  the  strategy  defines  specific  roles  and  responsibilities  of  other
Agency organizations, including Center finance offices, for carrying out correc-
tive  actions,  and  that  the  Center  plans  for  improving  financial  management
support the strategy;
• compare the personnel and resources required to execute the strategy against
existing resources to determine what actions can realistically be accomplished
and when;
• establish  relative  priorities,  based  on  available  resources,  that  focus  first  on
actions  to  ensure  that  the  Agency  can  correctly  process  current-year  trans-
actions; or
• contain  realistic  milestones  and  completion  dates.  If  a  date  cannot  be  deter-
mined, then the plan should indicate that the date is to be determined (TBD)
later.

Our  continuing  efforts  to  obtain  comprehensive  corrective  action  plans  to  address
the internal control deficiencies identified during NASA’s financial statement audits
have largely been unsuccessful. NASA senior management continues to provide only
high-level, broadly worded proposed initiatives that lack sufficient detail and strate-
gies to address the outstanding deficiencies. My office, along with the OCFO, is en-
gaged in a conversation with the Administrator in identifying the best path forward.

BIOGRAPHY FOR ROBERT W. COBB

Following  nomination  by  President  George  W.  Bush  and  confirmation  by  the
United  States  Senate,  Robert  W.  Cobb  took  office  as  NASA’s  Inspector  General  on
April 22, 2002. As Inspector General, Mr. Cobb is a member of the President’s Coun-
cil on Integrity and Efficiency. He also served as an ‘‘observer’’ to the Columbia Ac-
cident Investigation Board, which examined the February 1, 2003, loss of the Space
Shuttle Columbia and its crew.

Mr. Cobb was previously Associate Counsel to the President. In this role, he han-
dled  the  administration  of  the  White  House  ethics  program  under  the  supervision
of  the  Counsel  to  the  President  and  was  responsible  for  administration  of  the  con-
flict of interest and financial disclosure clearance processes for candidates for nomi-
nation to Senate-confirmed positions.

Prior  to  joining  the  Office  of  the  Counsel  to  the  President  in  January  2001,  Mr.
Cobb worked for almost nine years at the United States Office of Government Eth-
ics.  Prior  to  Government  service,  he  worked  for  five  years  as  an  associate  attorney
at  Ober,  Kaler,  Grimes  &  Shriver.  Mr.  Cobb  is  a  1986  graduate,  cum  laude,  from
George  Washington  University’s  National  Law  Center,  and  a  1982  graduate,  cum
laude, from Vanderbilt University.

Earth  and  increased  our  understanding  of  the  universe.  At  the
same  time,  NASA  has  struggled  in  the  area  of  financial  manage-
ment, with significant challenges in accounting and record keeping.
My testimony has two parts: first, NASA’s financial management
challenges;  and  second,  the  key  elements  necessary  for  successful
business transformation.

First, NASA’s financial management challenges impact its ability
not  only  to  prepare  financial  statements,  but  more  importantly  to
effectively manage its contractors and major programs.

The  causes  of  the  financial  management  challenges  include
human  capital,  processes,  and  systems.  GAO  and  IG  reports  have
highlighted  problems  overseeing  contractors  and  controlling  pro-
gram  costs,  producing  credible  cost  estimates,  and  reporting  reli-
able costs for the Space Station and related Shuttle support. These
problems are not new with NASA’s contract management being on
GAO’s high-risk list since our first report in 1990.

Financial  management  is  key  to  this  ongoing  high-risk  area.
Why? Because NASA remains unable to provide timely, reliable fi-
nancial  and  performance  information  for  program  managers  and
cost estimators to effectively do their jobs. Further, the lack of reli-
able information for NASA’s massive contracting operation has not
provided  the  transparency  necessary  for  effective  Congressional
oversight.

With respect to external reporting, the recent IG financial audits
clearly  show  the  ongoing  challenges.  Although  an  important  mile-
stone, a clean opinion on annual financial statements is not the ul-
timate  goal.  Instead,  the  goal  is  world-class  mission  support  for
NASA’s  large,  complex  programs  and  high-quality  financial  and
performance information for the Congress.

Let  me  move  on  to  my  second  point:  the  key  elements  necessary
for successful business transformation. Notice that I say ‘‘business’’
and  not  ‘‘financial’’  transformation.  The  reason  is  that  financial
management challenges must be addressed as part of a comprehen-
sive,  integrated,  NASA-wide  business  process  reform.  Clearly,
strong  leadership  from  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  is  important.
However, there is a significant cultural resistance to change across
NASA.

Moving from an environment of stove-piped operations to a more
integrated, transparent environment with accountability for results
is a substantial challenge. Thus, sustained and visible support from
the  Administrator  and  other  senior  management  is  a  key  element
to success.

Another key to successful implementation of NASA’s system that
is intended to address both the program management and external
reporting  needs,  we  agree  with  NASA’s  goal  for  the  new  system.
However, in 2003, we issued a series of reports expressing our con-
cerns  that  the  new  system,  as  implemented,  would  not  meet
NASA’s  stated  goals.  Our  report  released  today  shows  some
progress. However, overall progress to date has been slow.

Another  key  to  success  is  consistent  Congressional  oversight.  I
commend both Subcommittees for having today’s hearing, and I en-
courage you to continue your oversight. The challenges we are dis-
cussing today require well-managed, long-term effort by NASA.

In conclusion, as NASA embarks on a new vision for space explo-
ration,  successful  transformation  of  its  business  operations  is  crit-
ical. Over the next several decades, the Congress will likely be en-
trusting  NASA  with  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  of  taxpayer
money. In light of this enormous investment, the status quo is not
acceptable.

We  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with  NASA,  the  IG,  and
both  Subcommittees  to  see  that  NASA  successfully  addresses  its
human capital, process, and system challenges.

Mr. Chairman, this ends my statement. With me is Allen Li, who
is our Program Director for our NASA work. We both look forward
to your questions.

Long-standing Financial Management Challenges Threaten

NASA’s Ability to Manage Its Programs

What GAO Found

NASA’s  new  core  financial  management  system  has  not  addressed  many  of  the
Agency’s  most  significant  management  challenges—including  improving  contract
management,  producing  credible  cost  estimates,  and  producing  auditable  financial
statements.  Because  NASA  did  not  use  disciplined  acquisition  and  implementation
practices,  the  new  system  lacks  basic  functionality—such  as  the  ability  to  (1)
produce transaction-level support for key account balances, (2) properly identify ad-
justments  or  correcting  entries,  and  (3)  correctly  and  consistently  post  transactions
to the right accounts. In addition, NASA did not use the implementation of its new
system as an opportunity to transform its operations and instead, automated many
of its existing, ineffective processes. Compounding its existing problems, NASA also
failed to recognize the importance and need for highly skilled, well-trained financial
personnel.

Most  federal  agencies  have  been  able  to  obtain  unqualified  audit  opinions,  while
NASA’s  financial  statements  remain  unauditable.  However,  the  problems  experi-
enced  by  NASA  in  its  effort  to  reform  its  financial  management  organization  and
implement  a  modern,  integrated  financial  management  system  are  not  uncommon
among federal agencies. In fact, many federal financial system modernization efforts
have exceeded budgeted cost and scheduled delivery dates without providing the an-
ticipated system functionality.

GAO’s  related  report,  released  today,  details  NASA’s  progress  toward  imple-
menting prior recommendations related to its financial management system. Overall
progress has been slow, but in some areas NASA is beginning to take steps toward
improvements.

To  its  credit,  NASA  has  recognized  the  need  to  enhance  the  capabilities  and  im-
prove  the  functioning  of  its  core  financial  management  system.  Strong  executive
leadership will be critical for ensuring that NASA’s financial management organiza-
tion  delivers  the  kind  of  analysis  and  forward-looking  information  it  needs  to  effec-
tively manage its many complex programs. Such leadership must be combined with
effective  organizational  alignment,  strategic  human  capital  management,  and  end-
to-end business process reform.

Mr. Chairmen and Members of the Subcommittees:

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  the  financial  management  challenges
facing  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA).  Since  its  incep-
tion in 1958, NASA has undertaken numerous programs—involving Earth and space
science,  aerospace  technology,  human  space  flight,  and  biological  and  physical  re-
search—that  have  resulted  in  significant  scientific  and  technological  advances  and
enhanced  the  quality  of  life  on  Earth.  In  recent  years,  NASA  has  experienced  a
number  of  setbacks  with  its  programs  and  operations,  including  massive  cost  over-
runs  associated  with  the  International  Space  Station  and,  with  the  Columbia  trag-
edy,  the  need  for  the  Agency  to  develop  return-to-flight  strategies  and  mitigate  the
impact of the loss of the Shuttle on the construction of the space station. On Janu-
ary  14,  2004,  President  Bush  outlined  a  bold  new  vision  for  U.S.  space  exploration
that  will  set  a  new  course  for  NASA.  However,  a  key  to  the  successful  execution
of  this  new  vision  is  NASA’s  ability  to  address  a  number  of  long-standing  financial
management challenges that threaten NASA’s ability to manage its programs, over-
see  its  contractors,  and  effectively  allocate  its  budget  across  its  numerous  projects
and programs.

For  years,  NASA  has  cited  deficiencies  within  its  financial  management  systems
as  a  primary  reason  for  not  having  the  data  required  to  oversee  its  contractors,  ac-
curately  account  for  the  full  cost  of  its  operations,  and  efficiently  produce  accurate
and reliable information needed for both management decision-making and external
reporting purposes. In fact, since 1990 we have identified NASA’s contract manage-
ment  as  an  area  of  high  risk,  in  part  because  the  Agency  lacked  effective  systems
and  processes  for  overseeing  contract  spending  and  performance.  In  April  2000,
NASA  began  its  third  attempt  at  modernizing  its  financial  management  processes
and  systems.  The  first  two  efforts  were  eventually  abandoned  after  a  total  of  12
years  and  a  reported  $180  million  investment.  NASA  expects  this  current  effort,
known  as  the  Integrated  Enterprise  Management  Program  (IEMP),1 to  produce  an
integrated,  agency-wide  financial  management  system  through  the  acquisition  and
incremental implementation of commercial software packages and related hardware
and  software  components.  However,  in  April  and  November  2003—three  years  into
NASA’s  IEMP  implementation  effort  and  with  significant  investment  already  made
in  the  program—we  issued  a  series  of  four  reports2 that  detailed  weaknesses  in
NASA’s  acquisition  and  implementation  strategy  for  IEMP.  As  part  of  the  four  re-
ports  we  issued,  we  made  45  recommendations  aimed  at  improving  NASA’s  overall
management  and  implementation  of  IEMP.  Our  related  report,3 released  today,  de-
tails  our  assessment  of  NASA’s  progress  toward  implementing  each  of  our  45  rec-
ommendations.

Our  testimony  today  will  focus  on  the  results  of  our  recent  work  related  to
NASA’s financial management challenges and the Agency’s efforts to implement our
recommendations related to IEMP. Specifically, I will discuss (1) NASA’s key finan-
cial management challenges, (2) how NASA’s financial management challenges com-
pare with other federal agencies, (3) our assessment of NASA’s progress toward im-
plementing  our  recommendations  aimed  at  improving  IEMP,  and  (4)  the  steps
NASA must take to reform its financial management organization.

1 The  effort  was  formerly  known  as  the  Integrated  Financial  Management  Program  (IFMP).
According  to  NASA,  IFMP  was  renamed  to  reflect  the  addition  of  program  management  and
labor distribution.

We  have  performed  work  and  issued  several  reports  in  response  to  legislative
mandates and at the request of the House Science Committee. We also reviewed the
reports of NASA’s Office of Inspector General and the independent public accounting
(IPA)  firms  that  audited  NASA’s  financial  statements  for  fiscal  year  2004  and  for
several previous years. However, we did not review the IPA’s underlying audit work.
We  performed  all  work  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  government  au-
diting  standards.  Our  statement  today  is  drawn  from  the  findings  and  conclusions
in reports issued by GAO, NASA’s Office of Inspector General, and the IPAs.

In  summary,  NASA  currently  lacks  the  systems,  processes,  and  human  capital
needed to produce credible cost estimates, oversee its contractors and their financial
and program performance, control program costs, and produce timely, reliable finan-
cial information and auditable annual financial statements. Although NASA has ac-
knowledged  the  need  for  improved  financial  management  systems,  processes,  and
human capital and has begun to take steps toward achieving that goal, progress has
been slow. Because NASA did not adopt disciplined acquisition and implementation
practices  when  implementing  its  financial  management  system,  IEMP,  it  has  been
forced to take actions that should have been accomplished prior to implementation—
causing the Agency to unnecessarily invest time and resources to rework already de-
ployed  system  components  in  order  to  produce  a  system  that  meets  user  require-
ments.  Further,  NASA  did  not  use  IEMP  as  an  opportunity  to  transform  the  way
it  does  business  and  instead,  automated  many  of  its  existing  ineffective  business
processes.  As  a  result,  NASA  has  yet  to  address  its  most  significant  program  man-
agement and external financial reporting issues—including improving contract man-
agement,  producing  credible  cost  estimates,  and  properly  accounting  for  nearly  $38
billion of reported property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) and material.

NASA  has  fundamental  problems  with  its  financial  management  operations  that
not  only  affect  its  ability  to  externally  report  reliable  information,  but  more  impor-
tantly,  hamper  its  ability  to  effectively  manage  and  oversee  its  major  programs,
such  as  the  space  station  and  Shuttle  program.  Since  1990,  we  have  identified
NASA’s  contract  management  as  a  high-risk  area.  This  assessment  has  been  based
in part on our repeated finding that NASA does not have good cost-estimating proc-
esses or the financial information needed to develop good cost estimates for its pro-
grams,  making  it  difficult  for  NASA  to  oversee  its  contracts  and  control  costs.
NASA’s  difficulties  are  rooted  in  an  agency  culture  that  has  not  viewed  financial
management  as  an  integral  part  of  the  Agency’s  program  management  decision
process. Although NASA has acknowledged the need for improved financial manage-
ment  information  and  has  begun  to  take  steps  toward  achieving  that  goal,  NASA
currently  lacks  the  systems,  processes,  and  human  capital  needed  to  produce  cred-
ible  cost  estimates,  oversee  its  contractors  and  its  financial  and  program  perform-
ance, control program costs, and produce auditable financial statements.
NASA  Lacks  the  Systems,  Processes,  and  Human  Capital  Needed  to  Effec-

tively Manage Its Programs

As  currently  designed,  NASA’s  financial  management  system  has  not  addressed
many  of  the  Agency’s  most  significant  program  management  challenges—including
improving contract management and producing credible cost estimates. Because pro-
gram  managers  and  cost  estimators  were  not  involved  in  the  initial  design  and  im-
plementation  of  the  core  financial  module,  the  system  was  not  designed  to  meet
their needs and thus, does not contain the cost data needed to manage NASA’s most
complex  projects  and  programs.  This,  combined  with  NASA’s  failure  to  reengineer
its  contractor  cost-reporting  processes  and  a  lack  of  trained  financial  management
personnel, has undermined NASA’s recent efforts to improve its cost-estimating and
contract monitoring capabilities.

As we have reported numerous times, NASA consistently develops unrealistic cost
and  schedule  estimates,  which  at  least  in  part,  contributes  to  the  cost  growth  and
schedule  increases  in  many  of  its  programs.  To  adequately  oversee  NASA’s  largest
and  most  complex  programs  and  projects  and  mitigate  potential  cost  growth  and
schedule  increases,  managers  need  well-defined  processes  for  estimating  the  cost  of
programs  and  monitoring  progress  against  those  estimates.  A  well-recognized  tech-
nique  used  to  monitor  progress  on  contracts,  and  a  long-time  NASA  program  man-
agement  requirement,  is  earned  value  management  (EVM).4 EVM  goes  beyond  the
two-dimensional  approach  of  comparing  budgeted  costs  to  actuals.  Instead,  it  at-
tempts  to  compare  the  value  of  work  accomplished  during  a  given  period  with  the
work scheduled for that period. Recognizing the need to establish a disciplined cost-

4 NASA  requires  EVM  reporting  and  analysis  for  research  and  development  contracts  with  a
total  anticipated  final  value  of  $70  million  or  more,  and  for  production  contracts  with  a  total
anticipated final value of $300 million or more.

estimating  process  that  incorporates  the  concepts  of  EVM,  NASA  developed  a  cost-
estimating  handbook  in  2002—the  first  such  guidance  provided  to  its  cost-esti-
mating community and program and project managers. However, as we reported in
April 2003, the information requirements of program managers and cost estimators,
which  were  outlined  in  the  cost-estimating  handbook,  were  not  considered  when
NASA designed and implemented the core financial module—the backbone of IEMP.
When  NASA  deployed  the  core  financial  module  in  2003,  NASA’s  cost-estimating
guidance  was  inconsistently  applied  across  programs.  However,  NASA  has  recently
begun  to  take  steps  to  institutionalize  the  use  of  more  disciplined  cost-estimating
and contract-management processes.

For  this  initiative  to  be  successful,  as  we  have  previously  recommended,  NASA
will also need to re-engineer its business processes—including its contractor cost-re-
porting requirements—and configure its financial system to accommodate the infor-
mation required by program managers and cost estimators. However, NASA has yet
to fully address weaknesses in its (1) contractor cost-reporting requirements and (2)
financial and technical work-breakdown structure.

• Weaknesses  in  NASA  contractor  cost-reporting  requirements  affect  NASA’s
ability  to  manage  its  programs  and  monitor  contractor  performance.  NASA
obtains contractor cost data from two primary sources—monthly contractor fi-
nancial  management  reports  (i.e.,  NASA  Form  533),  and  monthly  contractor
cost  performance  reports.  Both  reports  contain  budget  and  actual  cost  data,
but  only  contractor  cost-performance  reports  contain  the  data  needed  to  per-
form EVM analysis. However, NASA did not evaluate the adequacy of its ex-
isting contractor cost-reporting vehicles to determine whether the reports met
the  information  needs  of  program  managers  and  cost  estimators.  Instead,
NASA chose to use NASA Form 533 data to populate the core financial mod-
ule  without  considering  the  merits  of  the  data  contained  in  the  contractor
cost-performance  reports.  Consequently,  the  cost  data  maintained  in  the  core
financial  module  are  not  adequate  for  monitoring  contractor  performance  for
NASA’s  largest,  most  complex  contracts—those  requiring  EVM  reporting  and
analysis.  As  discussed  in  our  related  report,  through  an  initiative  known  as
Project  Management  Information  Improvement  (PMI2),  NASA  plans  to  en-
hance  the  core  financial  module  to  provide  better  project  management  infor-
mation  for  decision-making  purposes.  As  part  of  this  initiative,  NASA  plans
to evaluate its contractor cost-reporting policies and processes.
• The core financial module as currently implemented does not capture cost in-
formation at the same level of detail that it is received from NASA’s contrac-
tors. Instead of implementing a financial-coding structure that met the infor-
mation needs of program managers, NASA embedded the same financial-cod-
ing structure that it used in its legacy reporting systems in the core financial
module. As a result, the availability of detailed cost data depends on the ade-
quacy of NASA’s legacy-coding structure. Therefore, in some cases, contractor-
provided  cost  data  must  be  aggregated  to  a  higher,  less  detailed  level  before
they are posted against the legacy financial-coding structure. To its credit, as
part  of  PMI2,  NASA  is  in  the  process  of  addressing  this  issue.  However,
NASA  is  still  several  years  away  from  reaping  the  benefit  of  these  planned
improvements.

In  addition  to  ineffective  business  processes  that  result  in  inadequate  manage-
ment information, we reported in May 2004 that NASA’s use of disciplined cost-esti-
mating  practices  and  EVM  analysis  was  undermined  by  a  lack  or  trained  staff  and
ineffective use and placement of cost analysts across the Agency. According to NASA
officials,  at  the  time,  resource  constraints  have  prevented  the  Agency  from  staffing
many project offices with appropriate personnel to fulfill all project functions. In re-
sponse  to  recommendations  we  made  in  our  May  2004  report,  NASA  has  begun  to
take  action  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  its  cost-estimating  and
EVM  analysis  staffs.  Specifically,  NASA  has  included  requirements  in  its  March
2005  update  to  NASA’s  Program  and  Project  Management  Processes  and  Require-
ments  document  that  should  facilitate  efficient  and  effective  use  of  cost-estimating
EVM analysis staff. Further, according to NASA, it plans to provide both awareness
briefings  and  in-depth  training  to  project  management  and  cost-estimating  and
analysis  personnel  to  ensure  understanding  and  knowledge  of  NASA’s  cost-esti-
mating  and  program  management  policies  and  procedures.  However,  because  these
initiatives  have  only  recently  begun,  we  cannot  determine  to  what  degree  these  ef-
forts will enable NASA to provide credible cost estimates.

As discussed in our related report, released today, NASA has recognized the need
to  enhance  the  capabilities  of  the  core  financial  module  in  order  to  better  serve  its
program management and cost-estimating communities. As NASA proceeds with its

planned improvements, it will be critical that the Agency address weaknesses in its
financial  management  systems,  processes,  and  human  capital  in  a  comprehensive
manner. Anything short of this will continue to put NASA’s programs at risk of cost
and schedule overruns.
Ineffective  Systems  and  Processes  and  Inadequately  Trained  Financial
Management  Personnel  Hamper  External  Financial-Reporting  Ef-
forts

NASA’s core financial module—the backbone of IEMP—does not currently address
many  of  the  Agency’s  most  challenging  external  reporting  issues—including  prob-
lems related to budgetary accounting and property accounting. NASA’s independent
financial  statement  auditors  disclaimed  an  opinion  on  NASA’s  fiscal  year  2003  and
2004 financial statements. The disclaimer resulted from NASA’s inability to provide
the auditors with sufficient evidence to support the financial statements throughout
the fiscal year and at year end. Further, material weaknesses were found in NASA’s
controls for: (1) financial systems, analysis, and oversight used to prepare the finan-
cial statements; (2) reconciling differences in Fund Balance with Treasury; (3) assur-
ing  that  PP&E  and  materials  are  presented  fairly;  and  (4)  securing  the  computing
environment that supports IEMP. Although many of these material weaknesses and
NASA’s  difficulty  in  producing  auditable  financial  statements  can  be  linked  to
IEMP,  weaknesses  in  NASA’s  business  processes  and  human  capital  management
are  also  factors.  Based  on  our  review  of  NASA’s  fiscal  year  2005  interim  financial
statements,  problems  associated  with  NASA’s  financial  management  persisted  dur-
ing fiscal year 2005.

Although  NASA  has  been  working  to  stabilize  the  core  financial  module  since  it
was  deployed  in  June  2003,  NASA  has  yet  to  produce  auditable  interim  or  annual
financial statements. In fact, as part of its report disclaiming an opinion on NASA’s
fiscal year 2004 financial statements, NASA’s independent auditor reported that the
core  financial  module  was  unable  to  (1)  produce  transaction-level  detail  in  support
of  financial  statement  account  balances,  (2)  identify  adjustments  or  correcting  en-
tries,  and  (3)  correctly  and  consistently  post  transactions  to  the  right  accounts.
These  are  basic  system  requirements  that  are  integral  to  the  effective  functioning
of a financial management system. For this and other reasons, for fiscal year 2004,
NASA’s  auditor  found  that  NASA’s  financial  system  did  not  comply  substantially
with  the  requirements  of  the  Federal  Financial  Management  Improvement  Act  of
1996 (FFMIA).5 FFMIA stresses the need for agencies to have systems that can gen-
erate  timely,  accurate,  and  useful  financial  information  with  which  to  make  in-
formed decisions, manage daily operations, and ensure accountability on an ongoing
basis. NASA’s ongoing inability to meet the basic requirements of FFMIA is central
to our reporting of NASA’s contract management as an area of high risk.

Because NASA’s core financial module does not meet basic federal financial man-
agement system requirements, NASA was unable to provide support for certain fis-
cal year 2004 financial statement balances including accounts payable and undeliv-
ered orders. Additionally, NASA was unable to provide the auditors with subsidiary
listings  of  cash  receipts  and  cash  disbursements  to  support  its  budgetary  outlays
during the fiscal year. Finally, according to the auditor’s report, NASA management
continues  to  identify  certain  transactions  that  are  being  posted  incorrectly  due  to
improper configuration of the core financial module. Based on our review of NASA’s
fiscal  2005  quarterly  financial  statement  notes,  many  of  these  same  problems  re-
main.  For  example,  due  to  functionality  and  configuration  issues,  the  system  con-
tinues  to  create  inappropriate  transactional  postings  which  result  in  abnormal  bal-
ances  and  misstatements  in  unobligated  balances  and  other  budgetary  accounts.  In
addition,  due  to  data  integrity  issues  from  fiscal  years  2003  and  2004,  the  opening
balances  for  many  budgetary  and  proprietary  accounts  in  fiscal  year  2005  are  mis-
stated.

Similarly,  as  part  of  our  recent  work  assessing  NASA’s  controls  over  travel  and
the use of its passenger aircraft,6 NASA was unable to provide us with timely, reli-
able  data  and  support  for  amounts  spent  on  travel  for  fiscal  year  2004.  After  four
months  of  trying  to  extract  travel  data  from  the  IEMP  system,  NASA  officials  pro-
vided  us  with  what  they  said  was  a  complete  population  of  travel-related  disburse-

FFMIA  requires  CFO  Act  agencies  to  implement  and  maintain  financial  management  systems
that  comply  substantially  with  federal  financial  management  system  requirements,  applicable
federal accounting standards, and the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger at the trans-
action level. FFMIA also requires the auditors of agencies’ financial statements to report on such
compliance.

ment  transactions.  However,  the  data  provided  were  missing  significant  travel  ex-
pense categories. For example, NASA had several contracts with major hotel chains
to  provide  rooms  at  discount  rates;  however,  NASA  did  not  include  the  charges  re-
lated to rooms purchased under these contracts as travel-related expenses. Further,
although  Agency  personnel  regularly  used  NASA-owned  passenger  aircraft  and
other  charter  aircraft  in  support  of  official  business  travel,  the  cost  associated  with
the use of these aircraft was not considered a travel expense and, therefore, the mil-
lions  of  dollars  associated  with  this  travel  were  not  included  in  the  data  provided.
In  addition  to  missing  data,  the  travel  data  NASA  provided  contained  duplicate
transactions and other data anomalies that made it appear as if NASA were paying
the  same  bill  multiple  times,  which,  for  those  transactions  we  tested,  was  not  the
case.

NASA’s  failure  to  provide  reliable  data  related  to  its  travel  disbursements  is  sig-
nificant  for  three  reasons.  First,  it  illustrates  the  shortcomings  of  NASA’s  financial
management  system  and  NASA’s  ongoing  struggle  to  provide  transaction-level  sup-
port  for  key  account  balances.  Second,  it  indicates  that  the  budget  amounts  NASA
reports  for  travel  each  year  to  the  Congress  are  significantly  understated.  As  part
of  its  budget  submission,  NASA  is  required  to  report  estimated  and  actual  obliga-
tions in terms of object classification. Object classes describe the nature of the serv-
ice  or  article  for  which  the  obligations  are  first  incurred.  One  such  object  class  is
object  class  21,  travel  and  transportation  of  persons.  However,  because  NASA  does
not  properly  classify  certain  travel  expense  categories  as  object  class  21—including
business travel on noncommercial aircraft and travel services procured using a con-
tract—the  Agency  travel  budget  is  significantly  understated.  Finally,  the  problems
we found with NASA’s travel data point to weaknesses in NASA’s full-cost account-
ing  initiative.  According  to  NASA,  on  October  1,  2003,  NASA  implemented  its  full-
cost  initiative  and  is  currently  operating  in  a  total  full-cost  environment,  which  in-
cludes  managing  programs  and  projects  in  terms  of  their  total  costs;  accounting  for
all costs as either direct or as general and administrative; and budgeting for a pro-
gram  or  project’s  full  costs.  However,  if  NASA  has  failed  to  capture  and  properly
link  travel-related  costs  to  the  appropriate  object  classification,  it  raises  serious
questions  about  the  Agency’s  ability  to  properly  classify  other  less  straightforward
cost categories.

As discussed previously, NASA did not use IEMP as an opportunity to transform
the way it does business and instead, NASA automated many of its existing, ineffec-
tive  business  processes—including  its  process  for  recording  PP&E  and  material  in
its general ledger. As we reported in November 2003, NASA does not appropriately
capture  and  record  PP&E  and  material  in  the  core  financial  module  general  ledger
at the transactions level. Instead, NASA first expenses its property acquisitions and
then  updates  the  core  financial  module’s  general  ledger  using  periodic  summary-
level manual entries—for both NASA-held and contractor-held property.

Recording  PP&E  and  material  in  the  general  ledger  at  the  transaction  level  or
item level at the time NASA makes disbursement for it would provide independent
control over these assets. However, just as it did with its legacy systems, NASA con-
tinues  to  (1)  record  the  cost  of  PP&E  and  materials  as  expenses  when  initially  in-
curred, (2) periodically determine which of those costs should have been capitalized,
and (3) manually adjust these records at a summary level. Because NASA does not
maintain transaction-level detail, the Agency is not able to link the money it spends
on  the  purchase  or  construction  of  its  property  to  discrete  property  items,  which  is
needed  to  provide  independent  control  over  these  assets.  Although  NASA  manually
records property at the summary level for both NASA-held and contractor-held prop-
erty,  NASA’s  most  significant  challenge  with  respect  to  property  accounting  stems
from  property  located  at  contractor  facilities—which  accounts  for  $8.5  billion  or
about  one-fourth  of  NASA’s  reported  $34.6  billion  of  PP&E  and  materials—because
NASA must rely solely on its contractors to periodically report summary-level infor-
mation on these assets to NASA. Until NASA successfully implements a single inte-
grated  system  for  reporting  property,  and  develops  a  methodology  to  identify  and
record capital costs as they occur, the Agency will continue to experience difficulties
maintaining  effective  control  over  PP&E  and  ensuring  that  it  is  not  vulnerable  to
fraud, waste, and abuse.

In  fiscal  years  2003  and  2004,  NASA’s  auditor  reported  that  continued  weak-
nesses in NASA’s financial statement preparation processes resulted in major delays
and  errors  in  preparing  fiscal  year-end  financial  statements.  According  to  the  audi-
tor’s  report,  NASA  personnel  were  not  consistently  utilizing  uniform  accounting
processes that record, classify, and summarize information for the preparation of fi-
nancial statements. Further, because significant weaknesses exist in the core finan-
cial  module,  NASA  management  must  compensate  for  the  weaknesses  by  imple-
menting  and  strengthening  additional  controls  that  will  ensure  that  errors  and

54

irregularities  are  detected  in  a  timely  manner.  However,  according  to  the  auditor’s
report,  many  of  these  control  procedures  were  not  adequately  performed.  As  such,
the  auditor  recommended  that  NASA  provide  additional  training  for  financial  per-
sonnel  to  ensure  that  they  understand  their  role  in  processing  transactions,  per-
forming  account  analysis  and  reconciliations,  and  maintaining  supporting  docu-
mentation.
While  Most  Agencies  Receive  Unqualified  Opinions  on  Their  Financial

Statements, Systems Modernization Continues to be a Challenge

The  problems  experienced  by  NASA  in  its  effort  to  reform  its  financial  manage-
ment  organization  and  implement  a  modern,  integrated  financial  management  sys-
tem are not uncommon. While the majority of CFO Act agencies have obtained clean
or  unqualified  audit  opinions  on  their  financial  statements,  the  underlying  Agency
financial systems remain a serious problem. Agencies still generally lack the capac-
ity  to  create  the  full  range  of  information  needed  to  effectively  manage  day-to-day
operations.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  for  fiscal  year  2004,  auditors  reported  that  finan-
cial  management  systems  of  only  seven  of  the  23  CFO  Act  agencies7 complied  sub-
stantially with the requirements of FFMIA.

7 There  were  initially  24  CFO  Act  agencies.  See  Pub.  L.  No.  101–576,  §205,  104  Stat.  2838,
2842–2843 (1990). The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), one of the 24 CFO Act
agencies, was subsequently transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) effective
March  1,  2003.  With  this  transfer,  FEMA  is  no  longer  required  to  prepare  and  have  audited
financial  statements  under  the  CFO  Act,  leaving  23  CFO  Act  agencies  for  fiscal  year  2004.  For
fiscal  years  2003  and  2004,  DHS  was  required  to  prepare  audited  financial  statements  under
the  Accountability  of  Tax  Dollars  Act  of  2002  (Pub.  L.  No.  107–289,  116  Stat.  2049  (Nov.  7,
2002) ).  Because  DHS  was  not  a  CFO  Act  agency,  it  was  not  subject  to  FFMIA  for  fiscal  year
2004.  The  DHS  Financial  Accountability  Act,  Pub.  L.  No.  108–330,  118  Stat.  1275  (Oct.  16,
2004),  added  DHS  to  the  list  of  CFO  Act  agencies  and  deleted  FEMA,  increasing  the  number
of CFO Act agencies again to 24 for fiscal year 2005.

Similarly,  as  shown  in  Table  1,  auditors  reported  that  only  four  agencies  had  no
material  internal  control  weaknesses.  A  material  weakness  is  a  condition  that  pre-
cludes  the  entity’s  internal  control  from  providing  reasonable  assurance  that
misstatements,  losses,  or  noncompliance  material  in  relation  to  the  financial  state-
ments  or  to  stewardship  information  would  be  prevented  or  detected  on  a  timely
basis.

NASA’s  problems  implementing  IEMP  are  similar  to  those  of  other  agencies  we
have  audited.  Modernizing  financial  management  systems  is  critical  to  instituting
strong  financial  management  so  that  the  systematic  measurement  of  performance,
the  development  of  cost  information,  and  the  integration  of  program,  budget,  and
financial  information  for  management  reporting  can  be  achieved.  The  federal  gov-
ernment  has  spent  billions  of  dollars  developing  and  implementing  financial  man-
agement  systems  throughout  federal  agencies.  However,  many  of  these  efforts  have
exceeded  budgeted  cost  and  scheduled  delivery  dates  without  providing  the  antici-
pated system functionality.

Although  the  implementation  of  any  major  system  is  not  risk  free,  organizations
that  follow  and  effectively  implement  disciplined  processes,  along  with  effective
human  capital  and  IT  management  practices,  can  reduce  these  risks  to  acceptable
levels.  We  have  issued  numerous  reports  highlighting  the  problems  associated  with
the  inability  to  effectively  implement  disciplined  processes  in  the  areas  of  require-
ments  management,  testing,  data  conversion  and  system  interfaces,  risk  manage-
ment, and project management. For example, ill-defined or incomplete requirements
have  been  identified  by  many  experts  as  a  root  cause  of  system  failure.  As  a  case
in  point,  we  recently  reported8 that  the  Army  has  encountered  problems  imple-
menting a new system intended to improve depot operations. One reason that users
had  not  been  provided  with  the  intended  systems  capabilities  was  because  of  the
breakdown  in  the  requirements  management  process.  As  a  consequence,  the  Army
implemented  error-prone,  time-consuming  manual  work-arounds  to  minimize  dis-
ruption  to  critical  operations,  and  the  financial  management  operations  continued
to be affected by systems problems.

Similarly,  many  of  NASA’s  financial  management  problems  outlined  in  our  testi-
mony are the result of an undisciplined, ineffective requirements management proc-
ess—including the failure of NASA’s financial management system to (1) post trans-
actions  to  the  right  accounts,  (2)  properly  identify  adjustment  or  correcting  entries,
and (3) provide the information program managers and cost estimators need to mon-
itor contractor performance and produce credible cost estimates. To its credit, as dis-
cussed  in  our  related  report  released  today,  NASA  officials  acknowledged  that  the

the  core  financial  module  did  not  result  in  requirements  that  were  consistent,
verifiable, and traceable, or that contained the necessary specificity to minimize the
requirement-related  defects.  NASA  has  recently  implemented  a  new  requirements
management and testing methodology. However, NASA does not plan to use its im-
proved  requirements  management  process  to  properly  define  and  document  system
requirements  for  already  deployed  IEMP  modules  until  October  2006—when  NASA
plans  to  redefine  the  core  financial  module  requirements  as  part  of  the  core  finan-
cial module system upgrade.
NASA  Has  Begun  Taking  Steps  to  Implement  Some  of  Our  Recommenda-

tions for IEMP, but Progress Is Slow

Our related report, released today, details our assessment of NASA’s progress to-
ward  implementing  our  prior  recommendations  related  to  IEMP.  Overall,  progress
has  been  slow,  particularly  with  respect  to  developing  a  well-defined  enterprise  ar-
chitecture,  which  is  critical  for  guiding  and  constraining  NASA’s  investment  in
IEMP. However, in some other areas—such as NASA’s initiative to enhance the core
financial module to provide better project management information—NASA is begin-
ning to make progress. Of the 45 recommendations we made, NASA has closed three
and partially implemented 13; however, 29 recommendations remain open.

In 2003, we issued four reports outlining the considerable challenges NASA faces
in meeting its IEMP commitments and providing NASA with the necessary tools to
oversee  its  contracts  and  manage  its  programs.  For  example,  in  April  2003,  we  re-
ported  that  NASA  had  deferred  addressing  the  needs  of  key  system  stakeholders,
including  program  managers  and  cost  estimators,  and  was  not  following  key  best
practices  for  acquiring  and  implementing  the  system.  Then,  in  November  2003,  we
reported that NASA (1) acquired and deployed system components of IEMP without
an  enterprise  architecture,  or  agency-wide  modernization  blueprint,  to  guide  and
constrain  program  investment  decisions;  (2)  did  not  use  disciplined  cost-estimating
processes  or  recognized  best  practices  in  preparing  its  life-cycle  cost  estimates;  and
(3) had delayed implementation of many key external reporting capabilities.

As  part  of  the  four  reports  we  issued  on  IEMP,  we  made  45  recommendations  in
the  following  areas:  commercial  system  component  integration;  enterprise  architec-
ture development and use; risk mitigation; system requirements definition, manage-
ment, and testing; external financial reporting; and program cost and schedule con-
trol. Since that time, NASA’s effort has been focused primarily on trying to stabilize
the  core  financial  module,  the  backbone  of  IEMP.  However,  in  our  report  being  re-
leased today, we recognize that NASA has begun taking steps to implement a num-
ber  of  our  recommendations.  Table  2  summarizes  our  assessment  of  the  extent  to
which NASA has implemented our recommendations.

57

In its written comments on our draft report, NASA raised concerns that our char-
acterization  of  certain  recommendations  as  ‘‘open’’  did  not  appropriately  recognize
the  full  extent  of  the  Agency’s  effort  and  suggested  that  we  use  instead  ‘‘partially
implemented’’  or,  whenever  appropriate,  ‘‘closed.’’  We  disagree  with  NASA’s  assess-
ment.

We considered a recommendation closed when NASA provided us with documenta-
tion  that  demonstrated  it  had  fully  addressed  the  concerns  we  raised  in  our  prior
reports. Recognizing that many of our recommendations may take considerable time
and effort to fully implement, we considered the recommendation to be partially im-
plemented if the documentation provided indicated that NASA had made significant
progress  addressing  our  concerns.  For  recommendations  we  consider  open,  NASA’s
documentation  indicated  that  the  Agency  was  either  in  the  very  early  planning
stages or had not yet begun to implement the recommendation.
NASA Faces Significant Challenges in Reforming Its Financial Management

Operations

Successfully  stabilizing  and  enhancing  NASA’s  financial  management  system  are
essential  to  enabling  the  Agency  to  provide  its  managers  with  the  kind  of  timely,
relevant, and reliable information that they need to manage cost, measure perform-
ance,  and  make  program-funding  decisions.  However,  NASA  cannot  rely  on  tech-
nology alone to solve its financial management problems. Rather, NASA must trans-
form its financial management organization into a customer-focused partner in pro-
gram results, but its ability to do this hinges on the sustained leadership of NASA’s
top executives.

Clear, strong executive leadership will be critical for ensuring that NASA’s finan-
cial  management  organization  delivers  the  kind  of  analysis  and  forward-looking  in-
formation that the Agency needs to effectively manage its many complex programs.
To  be  effective,  such  leadership  must  also  combine  with  effective  organizational
alignment,  strategic  human  capital  management,  and  end-to-end  business  process
improvement.  This  goes  far  beyond  merely  obtaining  an  unqualified  audit  opinion
and  requires  that  agency  financial  managers  focus  on  their  overall  operations  in  a
strategic  way  and  not  be  content  with  an  automated  system  that  helps  the  Agency
get  a  ‘‘clean’’  audit  opinion  once  a  year  without  providing  additional  value  to  the
program managers and cost estimators who use its financial data.

The challenges that NASA faces in reforming its financial management operations
are daunting, but not insurmountable. However, our experience has shown that im-
provements in several key elements are needed for NASA to effectively address the

underlying  causes  of  its  financial  management  challenges.  These  elements,  which
will be key to any successful approach to financial management reform, include:

58

• addressing NASA’s financial management challenges as part of a comprehen-

sive, integrated, NASA-wide business process reform;

• providing for sustained leadership by the Administrator to implement needed

financial management reforms;

• establishing  clear  lines  of  responsibility,  authority,  and  accountability  for

such reform tied to the Administrator;

• incorporating  results-oriented  performance  measures  and  monitoring  tied  to

financial management reforms;

• providing appropriate incentives or consequences for action or inaction;
• developing and using an enterprise-wide system architecture to guide and di-

rect financial management modernization investments; and

• ensuring effective oversight and monitoring.

Conclusion

As  NASA  embarks  upon  the  new  course  set  by  the  President  in  2004,  a  key  to
successfully  implementing  the  vision  of  expanded  U.S.  space  exploration  is  NASA’s
ability to address a number of long-standing financial management challenges. The
lack of reliable, day-to-day information continues to threaten NASA’s ability to man-
age  its  programs,  oversee  its  contractors,  and  effectively  allocate  its  budget  across
its  numerous  projects  and  programs.  Although  NASA  has  acknowledged  the  need
for improved financial management systems, business processes, and human capital
management  and  has  begun  to  take  steps  toward  achieving  those  goals,  progress
has  been  slow.  By  expeditiously  implementing  each  of  the  recommendations  con-
tained  in  our  related  report,  NASA  has  the  opportunity  to  minimize  the  impact  of
past mistakes and begin to reap the benefits of operating with an integrated finan-
cial management system. Further, clear, strong executive leadership will be critical
for  ensuring  that  NASA’s  financial  management  organization  delivers  the  kind  of
analysis  and  forward-looking  information  needed  to  effectively  manage  its  many
complex programs.

In closing, we commend the Subcommittees for holding this hearing as a catalyst
for  improving  NASA’s  financial  management  and  business  processes.  Continued
oversight  will  be  critical  to  ensuring  that  NASA  achieves  its  goals  for  improved  fi-
nancial  management  and  reformed  business  processes.  Mr.  Chairmen,  this  con-
cludes  our  prepared  statement.  We  would  be  pleased  to  respond  to  any  questions
that you or other Members of the Subcommittees may have.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Thank  you.  And  thank  you  for  your  testi-

mony.

SARBANES-OXLEY COMPARISONS

As  you  all  were  giving  your  testimony,  I  was  thinking—I  have
been  listening  to  complaints  from  friends  of  mine  in  the  business
sectors about Sarbanes-Oxley and the difficulties that they have in
meeting  the  requirements  of  Sarbanes-Oxley,  and  especially  small
corporations  that  are  burdened  with  tremendous  accounting  dif-
ficulties  and  the  rest.  So  I  was  thinking,  before  I  get  into  my  list
of  questions,  if  NASA  was  subject  to  Sarbanes-Oxley,  and  Ms.
Sykes,  you  are  the  Chief  Financial  Officer,  would  you  sign  that  fi-
nancial statement?

Ms. SYKES. At this point, no, sir.
Chairman  CALVERT.  You  know,  we,  in  government,  pass  laws,
and  we  submit  businesses  and  corporations  to  difficult  processes
and with penalties involved if they don’t meet them, but I think it
is important that we, in government, attempt to do as we ask oth-
ers to do.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PLAN AND THE

CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN

And so with that, Ms. Sykes, Mr. Cobb outlined in his testimony
the  ingredients  necessary  for  a  successful  plan  to  correct  NASA’s
financial problems. He says you have been working on such a plan
since  2003.  And  indeed,  you  promised  to  deliver  to  this  committee
a plan for some time. Yet, so far, Mr. Cobb says, the plans you pro-
vided,  based  on  his  testimony,  have  been  high-level,  broadly-word-
ed  proposals  that  lack  sufficient  detail  and  strategies  to  address
the  outstanding  deficiencies.  Do  you—one,  do  you  agree  with  the
Inspector General’s assessment? If so, when do you propose to pro-
vide an adequate plan?

Ms. SYKES. Thank you, Chairman Calvert.
NASA does have a financial management improvement plan. We
have been working on that plan for the last two years. It has been
solidified,  and  we  have  been  working  towards  the  elements  within
that  plan.  That  plan  has  been  shared  with  our  IG  as  well  as  with
your staff.

The  plan  that  the  IG  is  talking  about  are—has  been  developing
or  we  have  been  having  discussions  about,  is  the  corrective  action
plan. And let me kind of give the Committee a little bit of a detail.
The  plan  that  we  have  at  NASA  is  very  comprehensive.  It  in-
cludes  recommendations  that  we  received  from  GAO,  the  IG,  the
independent  auditor,  as  well  as  those  things  that  have  also  been
identified by Mr. Kutz here today that says you have to look at the
culture,  the  process,  and  the  systems  associated  with  that.  So  I
have  a  very  overarching,  detailed  financial  management  plan  that
we have been working towards and making progress on in the last
two years.

What  I  believe,  and  this  is  an  ongoing  discussion,  what  the  IG
is  looking  for  is  a  corrective  action  plan  which  focuses  on  those
items that have been identified in our audit reports or our—on our
financial  management  statements,  which  have  the  four  material
weaknesses that have been identified. We have had ongoing discus-
sions regarding that, and we are looking towards being able to pro-
vide one after we get our November 15 audit statement. And what
it will actually entail is basically taking information out of our cur-
rent  financial  management  plan  and  consolidating  it  into  a  dif-
ferent format.

We  will  be  working  with  the  IG  to  see  if  we  can  accommodate
his  wishes  in  that  area  and  also  provide  that  to  the  Committee,
which will provide additional oversight.

But  I  would  like  to  also  characterize,  as  Greg  Kutz  says,  the
overall goal is not to get a clean opinion, which I think a corrective
action  plan  would  be  its  overarching  goal,  but  mostly  trying  to  get
to a place within NASA where we are able to provide timely, accu-
rate, and reliable data for our program and project managers. And
that  is  the  plan  that  we  are  implementing,  and  that  is  the  plan
that we have been working on.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Well,  obviously,  as  we  move  forward  on—
and  as  you  know,  the  new  Administrator  has  a  very  aggressive
plan  to  move  ahead  with  the  CEV,  wants  to  get  it  operating  as
quickly as possible after the retirement of the Shuttle in 2010. We

have  a  definitive  schedule  that  has  been  laid  out  by  this  Adminis-
tration. And so I guess the American public, and I think—are prob-
ably  looking  at—that  we  can’t  seem  to  get  our  act  together  finan-
cially  over  a  long  period  of  time  relative  to  what—if  I  was  still  in
business, you know, if it took me a number of years to get this re-
solved, I probably, you know, wouldn’t be around. So I—you know,
I  guess  it  is—we  are  turning  up  the  heat  a  little  bit  today  to  say
that we need to get this resolved.

And  that—Mr.  Cobb,  listening  to  Ms.  Sykes,  your  office  has  re-
viewed  NASA’s  previous  draft  corrective  plans.  Can  you  explain
your  opinion  of  those  drafts?  And  what  would  you  like  to  see  in  a
corrective action plan?

Mr.  COBB.  As  my  testimony  reflects,  what  we  would  like  to  see
is,  in  effect,  how  the  plan  can,  if  implemented,  get  you  to  the  re-
sults  that  you  are  looking  for.  In  other  words,  what  is  the  vision
for  where  you  want  to  be,  and  then  what  are  the  principles  that
will  guide  your  implementation  strategies,  and  what  are  the  steps
that  you  need  to  take  to  get  to  that  end  goal?  And  in  many  re-
spects,  what  we  have  found  lacking—and  many  times  there  are
very detailed suggestions, but what we find lacking is how are you
going to get from point A to point B?

Chairman  CALVERT.  And  how  long  is  that  going  to  take  to  get
the—if we can’t get the plan together—if it has taken us two years
to  get  the  plan  together,  you  know,  some  people  may  ask  how  are
we going to fix the problem in general?

Mr.  COBB.  Well,  I  would  agree  with  the  idea  that  there  is  not
going to be a quick fix, that once you have your plan in place that
makes  sense,  that  it  may  still  take  years  to  execute  the  plan.  But
where  you  don’t,  in  my  view,  have  a  plan  that  gets  you  to—even
lays out how you are going to get to the end result, then you have
got no chance of ever getting there.

CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN TIMETABLE

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  guess  the  question  is  when  are  we  going
to  get  the—when  are  we  going  to  have  a  definitive  plan  that  this
committee and the public can look at?

Ms.  SYKES.  Currently,  NASA  does  have  a  plan.  The  one  that
the—‘‘Moose’’ is relating to, we have. We actually had a review that
was  done  since  Administrator  Griffin  came  on  board,  and  we  had
Linda Combs and Ted McPherson and other government represent-
atives  come  in  and  review  our  plan,  review  our  strategy,  review
what  was  in  the  plan,  mapping  that  to  the  people,  the  personnel,
the time, the requirements that were necessary. After we had that
review, the IG was also a part of that discussion, it was an all-day
session,  with  Linda  Combs  in  attendance,  and  they  provided  us
guidance  and  information  as  far  as  what  things  we  needed  to
tweak.  That  has  been  the  plan  that  NASA  has  been  operating
under  for  the  last  two  years.  It  is  not  that  we  need  to  develop  a
plan; it is the fact that we need to execute.

As you know, and I have shared with the Committees before, and
since  Administrator  Griffin  has  come  in,  I  have  had  significant
challenge  trying  to  get  staff  to—in  order  to  meet  these  financial
management  challenges.  Since  Administrator  Griffin  came  on

board, I have been able to fill key elements or key leadership posi-
tions within my organization. That is a very significant start.

So  now  we  have  the  leadership  by  which  to  execute  the  body  of
work  that  we  already  knew  that  we  had  to  do  over  two  years  ago
and  that  we  have  actually  planned  and  developed.  And  with  that,
he has also given us the additional resources.

So what needs to happen at this point in time is basically coming
to  the  table,  between  myself  and  Mr.  Cobb  and  your  committee,
and sharing with you guys the detailed plan that we have and the
body of work that we plan on doing in order to provide sound finan-
cial management.

Chairman CALVERT. We look forward to that.
Ms. SYKES. Thank you.
Chairman CALVERT. Mr. Platts, you are recognized.
Mr. PLATTS. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, my appreciation for all of your
efforts,  and  as  I  said,  we  are,  hopefully,  all  on  the  same  team  in
what we are ultimately after.

PERSONNEL

I  want  to  pick  up,  Ms.  Sykes,  with—kind  of  where  you  left  off
on  staff.  And  a  number  of  statements  of  yours  and  Mr.  Ciganer’s
referencing  the  importance  of  staff  and  leadership  and  training.
You  can  have  great  systems,  but  having  staff  there.  And  I  am,  on
one hand, encouraged by some of the staffing changes, and you, as
Chief  Financial  Officer  for  the  Agency,  working  with  your  Center
CFOs and the more direct interaction that is now in place. I think
that  is  a  very  positive  step.  But  one  of  the  issues,  and  you  ref-
erenced getting critical positions. And looking at the Inspector Gen-
eral’s  statement  he  provided,  it  talks  about  your  office,  in  par-
ticular, and the variation that we started 2005 with an authorized
level  of  121.  That  was  then  reduced  to  103  in  March.  And  then  at
the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  in  September,  it  was  back  to  132,  but
now,  in  this  month,  it  has  been  proposed  that  the  ceiling  be  103.
I mean, that is all within one year. And so what is the explanation
of  that,  just  from  a  staffing  standpoint,  if  we  are  demanding  a  lot
from you? Your immediate office, the Center CFOs and staff is crit-
ical, and it seems like we can’t even quite get an understanding of
what your staffing needs are in your own office.

Ms.  SYKES.  We  have  identified  for  the  Agency  what  the  staffing
needs  are  in  order  to  overcome  the  financial  management  chal-
lenges  here  at  NASA.  That  has  been  presented  upon  Mr.  Griffin
coming  into  NASA.  I  was  one  of  the  first  two  individuals  that  he
met  with.  In  that  meeting,  I  provided  him  with  the  plan  and  an
articulation  of  the  staffing  requirements,  the  contractual  require-
ments,  everything  that  we  needed  to  do  in  order  to  be  aggressive
in  meeting  our  goals  and  improving  financial  management  here  at
NASA.

As  you  know,  and  as  Congressman  Calvert  has  already  stated,
we have some other emerging challenges throughout the Agency of
trying  to  fund  our  new  vision  and  exploration  missions.  So  as  an
agency, we have been doing internal reviews, and of course, NASA
has  to  play—NASA  CFO  Office  plays  a  role  in  that.  But  I  will—
I am here today to confirm to the Committee that my staffing level

62

will  remain  at  132  and  that  the  Administrator  fully  supports  and
backs that. And there has been no deviation from that. There have
been,  you  know,  memos  and  things  as  far  as  the  review  was  con-
cerned,  but  as  far  as  the—Administrator  Griffin  is  concerned,  he
knows that this a very important area, he knows that he is in full
support of this, and he is recognizing that these resources are need-
ed.

Mr.  PLATTS.  The—and  so  that  commitment  from  the  Adminis-
trator  is  since  that  review  proposing  103  that  you  are  going  to
have—there are——

Ms. SYKES. 132, correct, sir.

INTERNAL CONTROLS

Mr.  PLATTS.  Okay.  Following  up  on  the  Chairman’s  statements
regarding  Sarbanes-Oxley,  because  I  think  it  is  a  very  important
point of what we expect from the private sector internally, and you
gave  a  frank  answer  that  no,  you  would  not  want  to  sign  your  fi-
nancials  as  they  stand  today  and  where  you  are.  Let  me  focus  on
a  specific  aspect  of  getting  to  those  good  financials  is  internal  con-
trols.  This  Administration,  I  think,  has  taken,  you  know,  great
leadership  in  the  A–123  Circular  revision  and  really  focused  more
on that—what I call the kind of bedrock of good financial manage-
ment, which is solid internal controls. And you know, that deadline
is approaching in mid-2006, and to get to that deadline, you should
be pretty far along. Would you be willing to sign today on the line
saying  you  are  ready  to  be  in  full  compliance  with  A–123  Circular
regarding  your  internal  control  review  process  and  validation  of
that process?

Ms. SYKES. Actually, I would. Part of the—one of the things that
myself  and  Mr.  Ciganer  recognized  when  we  actually  implemented
our  new  system  was  that  the  level  of  internal  controls,  not  only
within  the  Office  of  the  CFO  and  my  ten  CFO  Centers,  but  also
that we needed to enhance or enforce internal controls as it related
to  other  financial  managers,  i.e.,  the  program  and  project  man-
agers.  Today,  we,  at  NASA,  have  already  established  our  Office  of
Quality  Assurance.  We  have  policies  already  in  place  for  internal
controls  in  order  to  implement.  We  provided  our  high-level  review
plan  to  OMB,  as  we  were  required  to  in  September.  But  however,
when we talked with some of the contractors that are actually com-
ing in to assist many of our agencies in implementing the internal
controls  for  A–123,  we  found  that  we  were  actually  further  along
than  some  of  our  counterparts,  because  we  have  actually  already
done  our  risk  assessments,  we  are  already  starting  to  validate  our
policies  and  our  processes  and  our  procedures  associated  with  our
financial  operations,  and  we  have  also  went  out  and  done  an  as-
sessment at all ten Centers to find out where we are, strengths and
weaknesses,  with  regards  to  our  internal  controls.  And  these  are
key  elements  that  are  going  to  be  helpful  in  moving  us  forward  in
financial  management  and  ensuring  that  the  data  that  we  record
is timely, accurate, and reliable.

Mr.  PLATTS.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  could,  just  a  follow-up  before

yielding, to Mr. Cobb.

The  process  that  the  CFO  just  talked  about,  I  think,  is  a  solid
one  and  an  important  one.  It  seems  like  your  concern  is  that,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

63

again,  getting  to  kind  of  the  baseline  that  the  documentation,  the
accuracy of the documentation that we would put into that analysis
may  still  be  problematic  to  having  good  internal  controls.  Do  you
want to expand on that or respond?

Mr.  COBB.  Sure,  if  you  can’t  verify,  that  is  a  significant  internal
control  failure,  and  so,  you  know,  in  terms  of  our  ability,  we
haven’t  verified—have  not  been  able  to  verify  many  of  the  steps
that  the  CFO’s  Office  has  taken,  such  that  they  have  established
a quality assurance. The effectiveness of the Quality Assurance Of-
fice we have not been able to verify yet in terms of its application.
So I really——

Mr.  PLATTS.  And  that  is  just  because  of  where  you  are  in  this

stage? I mean, that is pretty early on, I guess?
Mr. COBB. It is really where both of us are.
Mr. PLATTS. Right.
Mr.  COBB.  So  we—but  I  don’t  have  a  sense.  I  mean,  really  what
our  testimony  about—is  about  and  what  the  auditors  have  found
are  breakdowns  in  the  internal  control  structures,  and  those  are
manifest and really are the primary reason that the financial state-
ments can’t get a positive opinion.

Mr. PLATTS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Udall.
Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thanks to the panel for your insightful comments.
If I could, I want to direct a question to Mr. Cobb and Mr. Kutz.

IMPACT OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ON PROJECT

MANAGEMENT

In  your  written  testimony,  Mr.  Cobb,  you  state  that  NASA’s  fi-
nancial management system, in its current state, will not routinely
provide  programs  managers  and  other  key  stakeholders  and  deci-
sion-makers,  including  the  Congress,  with  the  financial  related  in-
formation needed to estimate costs, measure program performance,
and ensure accountability.

Mr. Kutz, your testimony appears to agree with the IG. You have
entitled it long-standing financial management challenges threaten
NASA’s ability to manage its programs. And then you go on to say
NASA’s new Core Financial Management system has not addressed
many  of  the  Agency’s  most  significant  management  challenges,  in-
cluding  improving  contract  management,  producing  credible  cost
estimates,  and  producing  auditable  financial  statements.  I  think
that obviously concerns all of us.

Would you both elaborate on the specific ways that the problems
with  NASA’s  financial  management  system  are  affecting  NASA’s
ability to manage its projects?

Mr.  Kutz,  maybe  we  could  start  with  you  and  then  go  to  Mr.

Cobb.

Mr.  KUTZ.  Yeah,  overall,  if  you  look  at  the—our  testimony,  we
talk  about  preparation  of  financial  statements,  accountability  for
property, plan, and equipment, budgetary reporting, program man-
agement,  cost  estimating,  and  all  of  those  types  of  factors,  and  we
have  had  NASA  on  a  high-risk  list  for  contract  management  since
1990, so this goes back since our first high-risk report then, which

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

64

means  that  the  problem  probably  pre-dates  1990.  And  the  funda-
mental issue that is central to really today’s hearing is the timely,
reliable  information  going  to  program  managers  and  cost  esti-
mators, who, as of the time we had done our studies of NASA’s new
IEMP, were not using the information from IEMP. They were using
their  own  cuff  information  and  their  own  separate  records  to  actu-
ally  manage  their  programs.  Now  I  know  that  Mr.  Ciganer  spoke
in  his  opening  statement  that  they  are  attempting  to  address  that
issue, and that really is the fundamental thing.

We  don’t  want  to  see  this  system  become  simply  an  accounting
system. We would like to see it be a management system that does
more  than  just  prepare  financial  statements  once  a  year  for  audi-
tors.  And  so  that  is  the  fundamental  issue  here,  and  the  most  im-
portant element of success for IEMP will be if it will help program
managers and cost estimators do their jobs effectively.

Mr.  UDALL.  Hence  your  comment  that  this  is  about  a  business

transformation not just a financial transformation.

Mr. KUTZ. Absolutely. Yes.
Mr. UDALL. Mr. Cobb.
Mr. COBB. I agree entirely with Mr. Kutz and his testimony.
You  know,  fundamentally,  we,  as  overseers,  you,  as  overseers,
the program managers want to be able to tell what happens to the
dollar  of  taxpayers’  money  that  they  spent,  and  the  system  fun-
damentally doesn’t tell them what happened to that. So from a pro-
gram  management  standpoint,  how  much  you  have  spent,  how
much  you  owe  vendors,  if  you  ask  for  ‘‘I  would  like  a  list  of  all  of
the  accounts,  vendor  accounts  where  I  have  accounts  payable,’’  my
understanding is that the system cannot generate that information
easily for you.

The—and I must say in connection with my overall duties as In-
spector General to root out fraud, waste, and abuse, when your in-
ternal  control  frameworks  don’t  work,  it  provides  an  environment
where  the  fraudsters  might  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  the  sys-
tem.

Mr. LI. Mr. Udall, I would like to address this, if I could.
I  have  had  the  honor  and  privilege  of  doing  work  for  the  Sub-
committee,  former  Chairman  Rohrabacher,  and  over  the  years,  we
have  reported  about  many,  many  challenges,  many  programs.  And
many  of—the  common  thread  amongst  them  was  that  program
managers  did  not  have  a  good  handle  not  only  on  what  state  the
program  was  in,  but  be  able  to  compare  how  much  value  of  the
work  that  we  have  expended  versus  what  we  had  planned.  And
that  is  the—that  resulted  in  such  situations  as  a  surprise  a  few
years ago when the Space Station incurred a $4.5 billion possibility
of a cost increase, cost growth.

And  what  the  IG  is  saying  is  absolutely  correct,  and  Mr.  Kutz,
also.  You  have  to  have  that  information,  have  that  early  warning
system  to  prevent  those  situations  from  happening.  You  can’t  wait
to  have  that  happen  and  then  to  have  to  react.  You  need  to  know
before that happens.

Mr. CIGANER. In—Mr. Udall, if I could——
Mr. UDALL. Sure.
Mr. CIGANER.—just comment on——
Mr. UDALL. Please.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

65

Mr. CIGANER.—NASA’s approach, there is—there are two compo-
nents  to  solving  this  issue,  and  as  I  stated  in  my  written  state-
ment, the goal of this effort is to improve the way the Agency man-
ages. But we are in full agreement with both the GAO and the IG
on that.

Unfortunately,  this  is  a  long-term  effort.  Our  plan  for  IEMP  is
eight years. We are now starting year five of that eight-year period.
And we have to basically stay the course and understand that, you
know,  the  fundamental  IT  premise  of  garbage-in,  garbage-out  is
still very prevalent in the sense that unless the fundamental integ-
rity  of  the  data  is  solved,  the  information  that  then  gets  provided
to  decision-makers  outside  of  the  financial  community  might  be
flawed.  So  we  have  been  concentrating  over  the  past  three  years
in  really  cleaning  up  our  historical  records  along  with  imple-
menting those just fundamental budget execution processes that al-
lows the integrity of that data.

As  I  stated,  we  are  now  in  the  process  of  rolling  out  module
Project  Management  Improvement  initiative.  I  think  that  the  title
of  that  module  answers  part  of  the  question.  That  is  specifically
aimed  at  helping  a  crosswalk  or  a  correlation  between  what  exists
in our books and what project and program managers need to make
decisions.  Unfortunately,  contractually,  in  some  cases,  the  way  in-
formation is presented to us from a billing standpoint when we re-
ceive a bill from a contractor might not be exactly what project and
program managers need for cost estimation. The information might
not be broken down the way it would be useful to do so. And what
PMII  is  attempting  to  do  is  crosswalk  and  correlate  that  informa-
tion.

Chairman CALVERT. Mr. Rohrabacher.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE

First  of  all,  let  me  express  that  I  have  faith  in  the  Chairman  of
this Subcommittee, Mr. Calvert, who I think has the business back-
ground to fully comprehend the depth of the challenge that we are
facing  in  bringing  this  situation.  Mr.  Calvert  managed  his  own
businesses,  and  I  know  that  he  wouldn’t  have  managed  them  long
because  his  businesses  would  have  been  out  of  business  had  the
same financial systems been in place in his operation, so I am look-
ing forward to working with you, Chairman Calvert, as well as the
other Members of this committee and Subcommittee to try to make
a  dent  in  the  problem.  And  I  think  if—that  should  be  our  number
one goal in this subcommittee with your leadership.

The—let me just say that the testimony we have heard has been
depressing, totally depressing. I mean, we—NASA has an image of
overcoming  the  challenges  that  are  preventing  humankind  from
going into space, and it seems that NASA has been unable to over-
come  the  challenges  of  good  financial  record  keeping.  That  is  de-
pressing.  In  an  age  of  computers  and  technology,  I  was  expecting
to  hear  about—more  about  accountability  and  success  of  account-
ability in an age of computers than we had 10 or 20 years ago.

Mr. Li has been a tremendous source of guidance and enlighten-
ment over the years, and I appreciate his contributions to this tes-
timony today.

Poor  financial  management  is  what  we  are  talking  about,  not
just  recent  financial  management,  but  over  a  long  period  of  time.
This can’t help but lead to waste, at the very least. Has it also led
to fraud? Whoever wants to answer that.

Ms. SYKES. I will start, sir.
With the implementation of the new financial system, that is one
of  the  new  architectures  that  we  have  been  working  towards,  we
have  noticed  that,  within  our  system,  that  we  have  been  able  to
process  and  be  able  to  track  transactions  throughout.  Having  ten
desperate systems would probably leave yourself much wider, much
open  to  the  possibility  of  fraud.  Recognizing  now  that  we  have  it
in  one  central  consolidated  area  helps  us  to  be  able  to  be  account-
able,  as  you  mentioned,  sir,  and  also  being  able  to  track  and  mak-
ing  sure  that  we  are  keeping  up  with  those.  And  also,  as  we  have
moved  through,  I  have  noticed—I  read  the—our  friend,  the  IG’s,
quarterly  reports  that  now  that  we  have  a  centralized  system  and
a  process  by  which  we  are  reconciling,  we  are  finding  that  if  there
were  some  opportunities  for  fraud,  waste,  and  abuse,  those  are  ac-
tually  coming  to  the  forefront.  Actually,  within  his  last  quarterly
statement,  there  have  been  two  that  he  has  identified  that  have
been actually reviewed, the data was provided, and there was some
type of——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Action taken.
Ms. SYKES.—action taken. So that is a definite enhancement, and
that is something that comforts me and makes me be able to sleep
at night.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  have  we  found  that  this  has  led  to

fraud, Mr. Cobb? Is that——

Mr.  COBB.  It  is  difficult  to  draw  a  direct  link  between  the  sys-
temic  weaknesses  and  internal  control  problems  and  the  frauds.
But let me give you a couple of instances. One, we had a case that
was prosecuted this semi-annual period where an employee at God-
dard,  in  effect,  stole  $194,000  of  taxpayers’  funds.  And  unfortu-
nately, the fraud was not identified by any NASA employee. It was
brought  to  our  attention  by  another  law  enforcement  organization
that  was  investigating  a  separate  crime.  And  when  they  were  exe-
cuting,  along  with  our  staff,  the  warrants  in  connection  with  that,
they found the evidence of this fraud.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  But  would  that—under  the  changes  that  we
have just heard about, would that have been taken care of? Would
that  have  been  exposed,  or  would  this—is  it  still—are  we  still  vul-
nerable to that type of fraud?

Mr. COBB. Well, I think, if you—in terms of, for example, the tes-
timony  of  GAO  in  terms  of  the  high-risk  list  for  contract  manage-
ment, that those vulnerabilities still exist. And I don’t believe that
we are anywhere near creating an internal control framework that
addresses  that  problem.  And  it—and  I  must  say  that  in  our  Office
of Investigations, we are having, unfortunately, a great deal of suc-
cess  in  terms  of  finding  frauds  of  employees,  for  one,  but  more
often of contractors in connection with kick-backs, setting up fraud-
ulent 
them,
misscharging,  stealing  grant  funds,  theft  of  government  property,
and  all  of  these  things  are  coming  up.  And  it  is—again,  it  is  very
difficult to draw the direct link between those frauds and the inter-

companies  and  diverting 

taxpayer 

funds 

to

nal control weaknesses, but I presume that where you have an en-
vironment  where  internal  control  weaknesses  are  poor,  inevitably,
you are going to have fraud.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. It encourages people, or at least it gives peo-
ple—it  puts  a—let  us  put  it  this  way.  What  you  are  describing  is
putting  a  temptation  in  front  of  people  to  make  more  money  than
they are supposed to make and, thus, they have gamed the system.

IMPLEMENTATION OF GAO RECOMMENDATIONS

The  GAO  issued  a  report  two  years  ago  asking  for—well,  they
made  45  recommendations  as  to  how  to  fix  NASA’s  financial  man-
agement  system.  This  was  two  years  ago.  And  it  is  like,  of  those
45 recommendations that were suggested two years ago, how many
of those recommendations has NASA implemented so far?

Ms.  SYKES.  Sir,  those  recommendations  were  related  to  our  sys-

tems, and our——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Yes.
Ms.  SYKES.—financial  management,  or  what  we  call  our  Inte-
grated  Enterprise  Management  Program  to  date,  I  am  going  to
defer  to  Mr.  Ciganer,  who  is  our  program  Executive  Officer  for
IEMP.

Mr.  CIGANER.  Sir,  out  of  the  45  recommendations,  GAO  ascer-
tains  that  three  have  been  closed,  13  have  been  partially
addressed——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Say this again now.
Mr. CIGANER. Three have been closed, 13 have been partially ad-

dressed, and 29 are still open. NASA——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Three have been closed?
Mr. CIGANER. Yes.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  So  you  accomplished  three  of  the  rec-

ommendations?

Mr.  CIGANER.  NASA  respectfully  disagreed  with  GAO  and  sur-
mises that 35 have been closed in our response. Now there is defi-
nitely room for differences here. A lot of those recommendations ad-
dress system issues, which, in many cases, are not going to be fully
addressed  until  the  entire  range  of  our  implementation  has  been
completed. That is in fiscal year 2008. We have been very up front
early on with the fact that this is a progressive series of steps that
are being taken. Some of GAO’s recommendations—by the way, we
endorsed  and  fully  addressed  each  one  of  those  recommendations.
It  is  taking  time.  Some  of  those  recommendations  are  long-term
and will hopefully get us off the high-risk list for contract manage-
ment,  but  until  the  forthcoming  applications  that  we  are  currently
developing are implemented, they will stay open.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Would——
Chairman CALVERT. The gentleman’s time——
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Would  the  Chairman  indulge  me  one  more

follow-up question on this answer?

Chairman CALVERT. Very quickly.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Just—Mr.  Kutz,  is  the  GAO  satisfied  that
NASA  is  moving  forward  with  trying  to  implement  these  rec-
ommendations that were made two years ago?

Mr.  KUTZ.  As  we  said  in  our  written  statement,  there  has  been
some  progress,  particularly  in  the  area  of  requirements  manage-

ment  and  life  cycle  cost  development.  In  the  other  areas,  we
haven’t seen as much progress, for example, in the area of external
financial  reporting.  And  I  would  say,  with  respect  to  the  29  rec-
ommendations  that  we  say  are  open,  that  does  not  mean  nec-
essarily  that  they  have  done  nothing.  It  means  in  some  cases  that
they are in the early formulative stages of putting a plan together,
and  so  I  would  clarify  that  to  some  extent.  But  we  do  have,  prob-
ably,  a  disagreement  as  to  how  far  they—how  much  progress  they
have  actually  made.  We  would  say  progress  has  been  slow,  al-
though moving forward in some areas.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Green, you are recognized.
Mr.  GREEN.  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  thank  the  Rank-
ing  Member  as  well.  Thank  you  for  your  dedication  to  NASA,  as
evidenced by our visit with you this weekend, Mr. Chairman.

Thank you again.

TIMETABLE FOR IMPLEMENTING GAO RECOMMENDATIONS

Friends,  I  think  that  the  Member  before  me  has  borrowed  my
question,  but  I  will  restate  it.  Sometimes  it  is  not  where  you  are
that is of paramount importance. Sometimes it is the direction that
you are moving in.

And I would query with Mr. Li first. Are we moving in the right

direction, sir?

Mr.  LI.  Yes,  we  are.  As  we  have  said  in  our  statement,  I  think
this  is  an  issue  that  is  long-standing.  NASA  has  had  these  prob-
lems  for  many,  many  years.  The  quantitative  comparison  of  how
many recommendations were closed and what is partially open and
what  has  been—still  remains  to  be  done  is  one  in  which  Mr.  Kutz
has  provided  the  right  perspective.  It  is  an  issue  that  how  far  and
what  does  the  Agency  have  to  show  to  you  before  you  can  be  cer-
tain  that  they  are  in  the  right  direction.  As  Mr.  Kutz  said,  some
of  those  recommendations  that  we  have  provided,  NASA  has  only
started the initial planning stages, and we were not willing to give
them a characterization of partially implemented.

Mr.  GREEN.  Mr.  Kutz,  sir,  at  the  present  rate  of  success,  do  you
have a prognostication as to how long it will take us to reach, say,
90 percent of our goal?

Mr. KUTZ. I would say that we haven’t seen enough, and I would
concur  with  Mr.  Cobb’s  earlier  statements  on  the  plans.  Some  of
the  plans  do  not  have  enough  detail  for  us  to  see  that  they  under-
stand the problem in some cases and have plans in place to address
the issues. So I think that until we see more firm plans that recog-
nize  fully  the  depth  of  the  issues  and  the  magnitude  of  the  prob-
lems,  there  is  no  way  to  predict  if  they  will  be  a  success  or  when
they will be a success. I think that there will be marginal success,
and  there  has  been  marginal  improvement  at  this  point.  But  what
we are all hoping for is that this will in fact transform NASA, and
that  is  a  very  significant  challenge.  And  many,  many  government
agencies  have  attempted  to  do  this  and  fallen  far  short,  and  what
happens—and  what  we  don’t  want  to  happen  here  is  a  billion-dol-
lar  system  that  does  marginal  accounting  and  doesn’t  transform

NASA’s  business  operations,  and  that  is  a  risk  you  face  with  this
system.

Mr. GREEN. And my final question will be to Ms. Sykes.
Ms.  Sykes,  what  is  your  prediction  in  terms  of  our  success  with

reference to a timeline?

Ms.  SYKES.  I  look  at  success  in  increments.  Last  year,  when  I
came before a different subcommittee before Congress, the issue at
that point in time was you just implemented a new financial man-
agement  system.  Will  you  be  able  to  continue  to  operate  on  that
new  system  or  should  you  pull  the  plug?  Two  years  later,  I  have
been  able  to  finalize  and  prepare  financial  statements.  That  is  a
significant  progress  since  that  time  frame  in  2003.  We  are  oper-
ating.  We  are  paying  our  vendors.  We  are  paying  our  contractors.
We  are  providing  information  to  our  program  and  project  man-
agers.  It  is  an  incremental  step,  incremental  progress  that  we  are
making.  We  have  a  plan.  We  have  been  executing  that  plan,  and
we  have  been  discussing  with  all  of  the  folks  here  at  the  table,
GAO, IG, as well as my counterparts in the other CFO agencies as
to  what  is  the  best  way  not  only  to  make  transformation  in  finan-
cial  management,  but  also  the  overall  business  portfolio  manage-
ment  that  we  will  need  in  order  to  do  our  new  vision  on  explo-
ration.

So we are making progress.
What is my prognosis? Where I am today will not be where I will
be tomorrow. And I could assure you that at any point in time, we
are making sure, here at NASA, that we are accountable and cred-
ible  for  the  resources  that  we  have  that  you  are  entrusting  to  us.

Mr. GREEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I yield back.
Chairman CALVERT. Thank you, Mr. Green.
And  I  am  going  to  recognize  Ms.  Jackson  Lee.  And  I  apologize

to both of you. I wasn’t able to bring any luck to your Astros.

So with that, I recognize Ms. Jackson Lee.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, we will take any apologies and
any  excuse  that  we  can  possibly  secure  this  morning,  even  the  In-
spector General’s review, but I think the Congressman and myself,
we still believe.

Let me thank both of the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the
Government  Reform  and  the  Space  Subcommittee  for  this  very
vital hearing.

Let  me  ask,  Chairmen  and  Ranking  Members,  I  would  like  for

unanimous consent to submit my statement into the record.

Chairman CALVERT. Without objection.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Needless  to  say  that  those  of  us  who  come
from areas where there are various centers, like the Johnson Space
Center, are strong advocates for both the mission and the message
and the purpose of NASA. But also, in the backdrop of the horrific
incidents  of  Hurricane  Katrina  and  the  President  oversight  now
given  to  FEMA  in  assessing  how  taxpayers’  dollars  are  being  uti-
lized,  NASA  cannot  expect  not  to  come  under  the  same  kind  of  fi-
nite and definitive scrutiny. But at the same time, I think it is im-
portant to make note of the structure that was not of NASA’s mak-
ing,  policy  decisions  that,  frankly,  I  have  vigorously,  in  many  in-
stances,  disagreed  with,  and  that  is  the  over-percentaging,  if  you

will,  of  contracting  out  NASA’s  work.  That  means  that  added  to
their  general  operations  is  the  idea  of  keeping  up  with  a  myriad
of  overlapping,  complex  streams  of  contracts.  Of  course,  the  indus-
try  has  been  a  very  viable  partner  with  NASA.  And  as  was  indi-
cated by my colleague, we were able to see, along with Mr. Calvert,
this weekend some very viable and productive coalitions, collabora-
tions, and partnerships. But let us make it very clear, NASA is an
agency  unlike  the  Department  of  Justice,  unlike  Health  and
Human  Services,  unlike,  if  you  will,  maybe  the  Department  of  En-
ergy in that the larger percentage of its employees are contract em-
ployees, the large percentage of its work is contractual work.

So I am not sure where we are going with that, but I would com-
mend  to  my  members  that  I  don’t  know  if  you  are  ever  going  to
get  your  hands  around  this.  I  hope  we  can.  But  I  hope  before  we
throw  the  baby  out  with  the  bath  water,  we  will  take  some  of  the
blame, because we have mandated to NASA to cut its employment
base.  That  is  an  easy  way  to  account.  You  give  someone  a  salary,
they  have  pension  benefits,  they  have  Social  Security  take-outs,
and they work. But it is very difficult when you have these massive
contracts.

Now  let  me  ask  both  Ms.  Sykes  and  Mr.  Ciganer,  if  I  can,  and
let me thank you all for your service. And let me also suggest that
our  questions  are  not  personal,  but  we  are  here  to  try  to  fix  the
problem.

The  first  question  that  I  ask,  and  let  me  just  share  these

thoughts with you.

The  first  question  I  want  to  know  is  how—I  heard  you  yield  to
him, but I want to know what is the interrelatedness of your work
together?  And  to  the  interrelatedness  of  your  work  together,  how
do you collaborate and cooperate and know the streams of revenue
and oversight?

Mr.  Li,  are  we  in  the  middle  of  proposals  to  be  received  for  the
CEV? Are you dealing with that issue on the outsourcing? Are you
dealing  with  that  on  the  outsourcing  area?  Is  that  your  area?  If
that  is  your  area,  I  would  appreciate  you  telling  me  what  present
outsourcing issues that you are dealing with with respect to NASA
at this point. I am going to a series of questions.

And then to the Inspector General.
What  is  the  time  frame  that  you  would  expect  to  begin  to  see
some  of  the  responses  and  the  corrections  that  you,  at  least,  have
indicated  to  come  from  NASA?  What  kind  of  time  frame  are  you
looking—having  looked  at  what  you  have  just  addressed  to  us,  as
I  have  been  listening?  What  kind  of  time  frame  should  we  be  ex-
pecting, as Members of Congress? How complex is it so that we can
be  realistic  in  the  steps  that  we  would  probably  be  putting  in
place?

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CFO AND THE IEMP EXECUTIVE

Ms. Sykes and Mr. Ciganer, if you can tell me what your collabo-

rative work is. How do you all work together?

Ms. SYKES. Mr. Ciganer and I are pretty much joined at the hip,
as  you  can  see.  Outside  of  our  offices  possibly  being  on  separate
floors, we work and collaborate continually. Both our staffs work in
continual operations as we move forward.

71

One  of  the  key  elements  that  we  have  found  in  working  in  part-
nership together and moving forward is Mr. Ciganer is in charge—
is  the  Program  Executive  Officer  for  the  Integrated  Enterprise
Management  Program.  That  is  the  overarching  of  which  Core  Fi-
nancial  is  one  of  the  keys,  but  one  of  the  modules  that  we  are  im-
plementing  as  we  move  forward.  There  are  other  modules,  like
travel management, contract management, human resources. Those
are  other  systemic  or  system  type  modules  that  we  are  imple-
menting. So as he implements and moves forward in those and any
financial  data  that  is  required,  we  partner,  we  team,  we  ensure
that we are moving in mock step. That is why we have a plan, and
that is what we have been operating towards.

Patrick?
Mr.  CIGANER.  Yes.  To  further  define  the  working  relationship,  I
am part of the Office of the Administrator, and I report directly to
that office. The logic behind that is to make sure that our task, the
task  of  my  program  as  tool  builders,  goes  beyond  just  financial
processes transformation——

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  But  does  it  make  your  job  tougher  the  way
that  the—NASA  is  constructed  that  you  are  doing—most  of  your
work is done through contracts? Yes or no?

Mr. CIGANER. It is more complex.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Okay.  So  it  makes  the  work  between  the  two

of you more complex?

Mr.  CIGANER.  Between  the  two  of  us,  it  doesn’t.  It  is  the  work
itself,  tracking  contractor-held  property,  tracking  very  large  and
complex  contracts  using  off-the-shelf  software  environments  that
were  not  initially  designed  for  that  has  made  it  difficult.  Now  the
reason NASA decided to put my program as part of the leadership
is  to  give  us  the  horsepower  to  get  not  only  the  financial  commu-
nity  but  the  programmatic  community  to  understand  this  is  not
only  an  OCFO  issue,  it  is  an  agency-wide  business  transformation
effort.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Cobb, can you quickly——
Mr. COBB. You asked about timeline and when you would expect

us to be able to see the——

Ms. JACKSON LEE. And also whether their structure makes it dif-

ficult.

Mr.  COBB.  I  think—in  terms  of  their  structure,  I  think  that——
Ms. JACKSON LEE. The contractual structure.
Mr.  COBB.  On  the  contracts  issue,  I—my  only  point  would  be  I
think  that  the  Administrator  has  articulated  that  there  is  a  lot  of
activities  that  previously  have  been  contracted  out  that  should  be
conducted  by  NASA  employees,  particularly  as  it  regards  to  sys-
tems  engineering  activities  and  that  that  is  something—that  is  a
capability  that  is  important  for  succession  planning  and  for  car-
rying  out  the  President’s  space  exploration  vision.  So  that  is  my
view on that.

With respect to timeline, again, I go back to what Mr. Kutz said
and  what  we  have  said  in  our  testimony.  Until  we  see  a  plan  that
we  think  will  work,  it—we  can’t  give  you  a  timeline.  And  I  must
say that, you know, this is not just a Chief Financial Officer’s prob-
lem. This is a NASA problem. You have got—whether you are talk-
ing  about  financial  management  or  procurement,  you  have  got  in-

72

stitutional  functions  within  the  Agency  that  are  on  one  side.  And
then  over  on  the  other  side,  you  have  got  program  management.
And  until  the  program  management  is  completely  locked  into  and
integrated  with  the  institutional  management  of  the  Agency,  this
problem  is  not  going  to  be  solved,  so  it  goes  well  beyond  the  Chief
Financial Officer.

Chairman CALVERT. The gentlelady’s time has expired.
Thank you.

NASA’S PROBLEMS IN CONTRAST TO OTHER AGENCIES

I am going to recognize myself for a question.
I  would  disagree  with  the  gentlelady  in  that  I  think  every—
NASA  is  different,  but  I  would  say  that  every  government  organi-
zation, every vision, every part of government has to be responsible
to  the  taxpayer,  and  we  need  to  know  where  our  money  is  being
spent, whether it is directly on contract employees or in any place.
And  so  I  would  ask  Mr.  Kutz  and  Mr.  Li  just  to  give  us  kind  of
a  relative  feel  for  this.  How  severe  are  NASA’s  problems,  if  you
compare it to other agencies?

Mr. KUTZ. With respect to systems, I believe there is—seven out
of  23  federal  agencies  have  compliant  systems,  so  NASA  would  be
one of the ones that does not have compliant systems. With respect
to  internal  control  issues,  there  are  only  four  agencies  in  the  Fed-
eral Government that have no material weaknesses. Some have as
many as double digits. NASA has three to five, I believe.

And with respect to implementing systems, such as the SAP soft-
ware  package,  we  have  looked  at  that  at  other  agencies,  particu-
larly  at  the  Department  of  Defense,  and  they  have  faced  many  of
the  same  challenges  that  NASA  has  in  implementing  systems.  So
I  think  that  some  of  the  struggles  that  NASA  has  had  are  not  un-
common in federal agencies.

Mr. LI. I agree with Mr. Kutz.
I—and the other perspective, Mr. Chairman, that I would like to
provide  is  that  up  until  now,  NASA  has  been  building  spacecraft
probably  on  a  onesie  and  twosie  basis.  In  the  next  few  years,  we
will  building  in  the  constellation  system,  building  the  CEVs  in
greater  numbers  and  the  lunar  modules  in  greater  numbers.  And
from that perspective, we are probably moving more towards a pro-
duction  environment  rather  than  the  types  of  uniqueness  that  we
had in the past.

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  guess  I—a  more  definitive  answer.  I—you
are  saying  that  there  are  a  number  of  agencies  that  are  in  the
same situation as NASA?

Mr. KUTZ. Yes, and again——
Chairman CALVERT. How many would that be?
Mr. KUTZ. In exactly the same position as NASA?
Chairman CALVERT. Approximately. Just approximately.
Mr.  KUTZ.  A  handful,  I  would  say.  Five  to  ten,  possibly,  in  the

same type of a situation.

Chairman  CALVERT.  And  how  many  agencies—for  instance,  that
you  supervise  and  you  take  a  look  at  in  your  responsibility,  how
many agencies of government do you take a look at?

Mr.  KUTZ.  Over  time,  I  have  looked  at  all  of  them  from  a  finan-

cial perspective.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

73

Chairman CALVERT. And how many, approximately, is that?
Mr. KUTZ. That would be 23 now, with FEMA being part of DHS.
So I have looked at them all. The one that I think is most common
with  NASA,  that  I  have  seen  from  an  accounting  standpoint  with
some of the challenges, is, in fact, the Department of Defense, par-
ticularly  if  you  look  at  areas  like  property,  plan,  and  equipment.
They  have  the  very  same  contractors.  They  have  property  in  pos-
session  of  contractors.  They  have  many  of  the  same  types  of  con-
tracts written. So I would say the Department of Defense has a lot
of common characteristics, the difference being the Defense Depart-
ment  is  enormous  compared  to  NASA,  and  so  the  challenges  at
DoD, I don’t see any solutions to those in the short-term.

This  problem  with  NASA  is  much  more  fixable.  And  if  you  look
at  the  idea  that  they  are  trying  to  accomplish  here  with  the  inte-
grated financial systems and business process reengineering, NASA
is  of  such  a  size  and  scope  that  it  should  be  something  that  could
be accomplished within a five-plus year period.

Chairman CALVERT. Well, do you think the lessons learned going
through this process could be transferred to the Department of De-
fense?

Mr. KUTZ. Yeah——
Chairman  CALVERT.  I  am  also  on  that  Committee,  so  I—both  of

us.

Mr. KUTZ. Yes, I do think that. And I think, again, that some of
the same root cause problems are there and some of the same chal-
lenges.  It  is  just  that  the  Department  of  Defense  is  such  a  large
organization with moving parts across the world, mobilized soldiers
for  the  global  war  on  terrorism,  that  even  there  you  have  payroll
problems. And I have testified on those issues multiple times, that
they have trouble even paying mobilized Army National Guard and
Reserve soldiers. So those problems—and Chairman Platts has had
hearings  along  those  lines.  So  I  think  that  their  problems  are
broader and more challenging.

Chairman CALVERT. Mr. Honda.
Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

FULL COST ACCOUNTING TO MISSION-ORIENTED

ACCOUNTING

This has been an interesting conversation, and I am sorry I came
a  little  late,  but  my  sense  is  that,  from  what  I  heard,  that  some
of these problems have come to our attention because of the change
in  Administrators.  Is  that  a  true  statement?  Yes  or  no?  Mr.  Cobb?
No?

Mr.  COBB.  Well,  I  think,  before  the  Government  Reform  Com-
mittee,  we  had—Subcommittee,  we  had  the  hearing  on  May  19,
2004,  and  I  can  tell  you,  for  the  last  3c  years  that  I  have  been  in
my  position,  this  has  been  an  issue  at  the  forefront,  primarily  be-
cause  when  I  walked  in  the  door  as  Inspector  General,  NASA  was
facing  a  disclaimer  that  had  been  issued  by  its  prior  independent
auditor.

Mr. HONDA. So——
Mr.  LI.  Mr.  Honda,  we  have  identified  contract  management  as

a high-risk item since 1990.

Mr. HONDA. Okay.

74

Mr. LI. That is how far it goes back.
Mr.  HONDA.  Okay.  So  from  what  I  understand  that  has  been
happening in NASA in terms of the administration of it, is that we
went  towards  full-cost  accounting  and  trying  to  run  NASA  as  if  it
were  a  regular  business,  if  you  will,  where,  you  know,  you  talk
about  FTEs  outside  of  the  issue  of  the  mission  of  NASA.  Now  the
Administrator has indicated that he is looking at realigning the fi-
nances of NASA based upon its mission and try to keep it as close
to that as possible. Has that caused more of a problem in terms of
managing—or well, the financial management of it because we are
moving towards a mission-oriented financing?

Mr. CIGANER. If I can answer, first of all, in full-cost accounting,
our  basic  premise  at  NASA  is  you  cannot  manage  what  you  don’t
know. Accounting only for contracts and external procurement and
basically  looking  at  all  internal  resources  that  are  essentially  free
is,  right  now,  in  exact  opposite  of  what  we  are  trying  to  do,  which
is be more sophisticated in the trade-offs. in moving forward, there
are major——

Mr. HONDA. Okay.
Mr. CIGANER.—and problematic issues.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FINANCIAL AND PROGRAM

MANAGEMENT

Mr. HONDA. Okay. So what I hear is that contracting now makes
it more difficult to manage, and what I heard a comment also was
that  the  Administrator  indicated  that  bringing  more  of  these  work
into  NASA  to  be  done  by  NASA,  in  terms  of  their  mission,  makes
more  sense  for  the  Administrator,  and  it  would  simplify  financial
management,  it  seems  by  the  comments.  What—is  that  a  true
statement? Mr. Cobb, would you mind answering that question?

Mr.  COBB.  I  would  say  that  the  Administrator’s  view  on  how  to
run  the  Agency  from  a  mission  standpoint  and  what  employees  he
needs  to  execute  the  mission  is  unrelated  to  the  financial  manage-
ment issues. It really has to do with mission management and how
to best carry out the program from that standpoint.

Mr. HONDA. It has to do with mission management?
Mr.  COBB.  Yes,  managing  to  the  mission  of  the  Agency  in  terms
of executing the programs. He thinks that for certain types of items
that developing a robust systems engineering capability within the
Agency  is  critical  for  the  Agency  to  carry  out  the  mission  over  a
long period of time.

Mr. HONDA. Does that mean that he wants to see more stuff done

in-house?

Mr.  COBB.  Wants,  basically,  thinks  like  the  architecture  and
making sure that the contractors are carrying out their roles is per-
formed by government employees rather than contractors.

Mr.  HONDA.  And  does  that  make  financial  management  easier?
Mr.  COBB.  I  think  it  is  unrelated  to  financial  management  and
really  doesn’t  make  it  any  easier  or  tougher,  in  my  view,  but  that
is a——

Mr. HONDA. The issue of contracting, then, if it is within the mis-
sion and it is in line with the mission and the expenditures are in
line  with  the  mission,  in  spite  of  whether  it  is  in-house  or  con-

tracting, then it is irrelevant in terms of what we are talking about
then?

Mr.  CIGANER.  If  I  may  add,  I  am  in  full  agreement  with  the  IG.
Basically,  what  we  are  trying  to  accomplish  is  maintain  a  set  of
core  competencies  in-house.  This  will  allow  the  Agency  to  have
much  better  control  over  overall  engineering  and  system
development——

Mr. HONDA. Which is in line with the Administrator’s idea.
Mr.  CIGANER.  Exactly,  but  he  does  know,  from  a  financial  man-
agement system, tracking, monitoring standpoint, it has very little
bearing. As a matter of fact, those are independent issues, like Mr.
Cobb mentioned.

Mr. HONDA. Okay.
To the Chair, if I may, the last question.
My understanding, as far as the mission of NASA, from this Ad-
ministrator—from  the  previous,  that  the  previous  only  looked  at
the  financial  issue  in  how  to  reduce  costs,  not  independent  of  the
mission  for  NASA,  and  the  current  Administrator  has  a  complete,
180-degree  approach—different  approach  to  the  running  of  NASA
and  its  management,  so  I  am  not  quite  sure  why  those  two  tech-
niques  or  styles—why  they  are  not  relevant  to  the  problems  that
you  are  having,  but  I  guess  I  need  to  understand  how  you  see  the
problem in a—more intimately.

Ms.  SYKES.  We  would  be  happy  to  get  with  you,  Chairman,  and
actually  have  a  conversation  and  delve  into  those  two  issues,  be-
cause they are separate and distinct.

Mr. HONDA. I would appreciate that.
Ms.  SYKES.  But  we  would  get  on  your  staff  and  get  with  your

staff and have that conversation with you at that point in time.

Mr.  HONDA.  But  I  can  sit  here  with  some  confidence  that  the
mission of NASA is intact and it is in line with—and they are hav-
ing  the  kind  of  support  they  need  financially  to  move  forward  on
their mission?

Ms. SYKES. Correct, and be in a position to provide them with the
information  that  they  need  to  manage  as  they  move  forward.  And
again,  we  have  been  following  our  current  Administrator  as  far  as
what  he  is  trying  to  do  in  mission  management  with  our  financial
system,  but  those  decisions,  as  we  move  forward,  are  implemented
within  our  financial  system.  But  we  need  to  have  a  separate  con-
versation as to——

Mr. HONDA. Okay. And we will have that.
Ms. SYKES.—what he is trying to do and how we could——
Mr.  HONDA.  And  Mr.  Chairman,  I  lied  about  the  last  question.
Let me ask one more last question.
Chairman CALVERT. Shame on you.
Mr.  HONDA.  These  are  the  current  deficiencies  of  the  financial
management system we have currently, then, and it is unclear how
NASA can credibly, you know, make that kind of a statement that,
you know, they can continue.

Mr.  Cobb,  in  your  opinion,  can  NASA  credibly  do  full-cost  ac-
counting,  given  the  shortfalls  of  its  current  financial  management
system?

Mr.  COBB.  I  think  it  is  inevitable  that  getting  the  full  benefit  of

full-cost accounting is a challenge for the Agency.

Mr. HONDA. Okay. It is a doable challenge?
Mr. COBB. It is a worthy challenge.
Mr. KUTZ. If I could add, too, it isn’t necessarily a software chal-

lenge; it is more of a process challenge.

Mr. HONDA. Okay.
Mr. KUTZ. And we have looked at the area of travel, for example,
and  found  that  the  information  NASA  reports  up  on  travel  is  in-
complete  and  inaccurate,  and  it  isn’t  because  the  software  doesn’t
work.  It  is  because  of  what  is  being  entered  into  the  system  and
what buckets it is being put into.

Mr. HONDA. Is it timely?
Mr. KUTZ. It is timely, but it is wrong, and so——
Mr. HONDA. Okay.
Mr. KUTZ.—you know, it is inaccurate, but it isn’t because of the
software  that  was  implemented.  It  is  because  of  the  processes  and
what—how the transactions are being coded in the first place.

Mr. HONDA. Okay. I think I am getting it. Thank you.
I look forward to our meeting.
Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Platts.
Mr. PLATTS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CORE FINANCIAL MODULE

Maybe  a  follow-up  there  on  the  processes  and  what  is  entered
goes  to  where  I  left  off  on  internal  controls  and  specifically  some
questions  specifically  on  the  Core  Financial  module.  And  in  Mr.
Cobb’s  written  testimony  in  talking  about  internal  controls,  there
is  an  example  of  the  new  Core  Financial  module  allowing  unau-
thorized  procedures  or  actions  by  some  parties,  and  for  example,
the example cited is that a single person could both authorize pur-
chases  as  well  as  make  the  payment  for  those  purposes,  so  you
have a breakdown in the internal controls within this new system.
First, is—I guess, Mr. Ciganer, is that a proper assessment? And
if  so,  what  is  your  response  to  how  you  are  making  sure  that  this
new  system  isn’t  moving  forward,  you  know,  that  is  not  guarding
against  that  kind  of  opportunity  for  error,  both  intentional,  mean-
ing fraudulent, or just unintentional?

Mr.  CIGANER.  At  the  time,  the  observation  from  the  IG  was  cor-
rect.  That  observation  was  made  when  we  had  just  rolled  out  the
new system. And as a consequence, the people that were in charge
of helping the testing of a lot of the functionality had multiple lev-
els  of  insight  into  the  system.  What  we  are  talking  about  here  is
segregation of duties where the internal control means certain peo-
ple  are  allowed  to  do  only  certain  things  through  the  system,  and
there  is  a  chain  with  an  audit  trail  in  which  everybody’s  input  is
recorded.

At the time where this observation was made, we absolutely had
folks  that  were  part  of  the  implementation  team.  They  were  not
permanent  people  that  would  operate  the  system  for  a  long  time.
They  were  a  part  of  the  set-up  team,  and  yes,  they  had  multiple
duties,  and  they  had  multiple  access,  which  could  have  potentially
resulted in some issues from an internal control standpoint.

This is something that we are addressing. We have tightened the
segregation of duties. As a matter of fact, we have now streamlined

77

some  of  the  processes  and  taken  people  out  of  the  loop,  which
means  that  although  the  number  of  transactions—there  is  a  chart
in  your  package,  I  believe,  that  shows  the  number  of  transactions
and  the  number  of  users,  and  you  will  notice  that  for  2005,  there
is  a  slight  decrease  in  the  number  of  users  although  the  number
of  steps  and  transactions  were  the  same.  That  is  because  we  have
streamlined, actually, some of those activities.

So  yes,  it  was  an  issue,  but  I  believe  that  we  have  addressed  it.
Mr.  PLATTS.  Mr.  Cobb,  have  you  done  any  follow-up  on  that  as-
sessment  that  it  is  an  issue  that  was  acknowledged  and  has  been
adequately addressed?

Mr. COBB. Yes, and I would say that this is an area of good news
for the Agency where it developed a clear and a step-by-step correc-
tive  action  plan  that  executed  the  plan.  And  many  of  the  defi-
ciencies that led to this being material weakness in the 2004 finan-
cial  statement  audit  have  been  remedied  so  that  it  is  very  likely
that  when  Ernest  and  Young  issues  its  audit  report  that  this  will
be removed as a material weakness.

Mr. PLATTS. Thank you.
Follow-up on the Core Financial module. There seems to be a dis-
agreement  on  the  ability  of  the  CFM  to  generate  financial  state-
ments  without  an  extensive  manual  effort,  you  know,  a  heroic  ef-
fort,  you  know,  on  top  of  the  program.  I  think  Mr.  Cobb’s  opinion
is that it still can’t do that, and Ms. Sykes, in your statement ear-
lier,  your  statement  was  to  finalize  and  prepare  financial  state-
ments  that—today,  versus  a  year  ago,  you  now  have  that  capa-
bility.  So  do  you  believe  that  you  are  at  a  point  where  you  can  do
that in an automated way without that heroic effort?

Ms.  SYKES.  Yes.  In  2003,  when  we  did  our  conversion,  we  still
had  to  actually  push  the  financial  transactional  data  out  of  the
Core Finance system into what we would call an access or a reposi-
tory and actually develop financial statements. And through—from
that  point  in  time,  we  have  been  consistently  and  methodically
working through the process, working with Patrick Ciganer and his
team, and we have developed a process by which we are able to de-
velop  financial  statements  directly  out  of  the  SAP  Core  Finance
system.  We  do  not  push  the  data  anywhere  else.  We  actually  use
the data transactions within the system in order to prepare the fi-
nancial statements. And when we delivered this past Friday our fi-
nancial statements, we did not make any outside or topside adjust-
ments.  All  of  the  transactions  related  to  the  financial  statements
for  the  audit  trail  are  within  the  system,  and  those  are  what  we
used to produce our financial statements for this year-end.

Mr.  PLATTS.  Mr.  Cobb,  what  is  your  assessment  of  that  is  it—is
more  the  accuracy  of  what  has  been  generated  as  opposed  to  the
ability to generate?

Mr.  COBB.  Let  me  answer  it  this  way.  Under  the  system,  as  de-
scribed  by  Ms.  Sykes,  before,  wrong  numbers  would  be  generated,
and numbers that NASA knew were wrong, and they had to make
adjustments outside the system to make the numbers right, as best
they  could.  And  that  is  what  the  system  was  before.  And  it  was
that way, my understanding is, up through the third quarter of fis-
cal  year  2005.  But  what  I  understand—and  I  am  not  altogether
clear  on  this,  but  what  I  understand  is  that  now  they  have  basi-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00083 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

78

cally constructed a system so that those adjustments that they pre-
viously  made  outside  the  system,  they  are  now  making  those  ad-
justments inside the system so that they get wrong numbers in the
system, then they adjust them inside the system so that when they
press  a  button,  they  get  the  numbers  that  they  wanted,  and  so
that—in effect, there isn’t, in my view, necessarily a big difference.

Mr. PLATTS. Ms. Sykes, you obviously have a different——
Ms. SYKES. I obviously disagree.
Mr. PLATTS.—thought.
Ms. SYKES. The statements that we produced for this fiscal year,
for  this  ending  fiscal  year,  were  produced  in  the  system—out—in
our  system  via  the  transactional  data,  and  I  am  not  sure  that  we
want  to  actually  make  a  comment  until  we  actually  receive  from
their—his independent auditors as far as their ability to go into the
system  to  actually  review  the  system  and  actually  look  at  how  we
produced  those  financial  statements.  We  are  not  making  any  ad-
justments  within  the  system,  only  to  correct  transactions  at  the

anything  else.  If  the  transaction  is  incorrect,  I  have  to  fix  the
transaction  in  and  of  itself,  and  I  have  to  have  supporting  docu-
mentation  and  detailed  information  in  which  to  do  that.  And  that
is what our ten Center CFOs have done in preparing for this year’s
financial statements.

Mr. PLATTS. Okay. Mr. Cobb, just to follow-up there——
Mr. COBB. Yes. And I feel that Gwen’s comment there is perfectly
fair, and really appropriate, and I was speculating in terms of what
was  happening,  and  I  do  not  have  the  factual  basis  completely  in
hand,  and  we  will  conduct  verification  activities  and  try  to  figure
out exactly how they get from point A to point B.

Mr. PLATTS. And once we get that—the audit, that will also give

us additional information?

Mr. COBB. I am hoping it will get to that exact point.
Mr. PLATTS. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

THE EFFECT OF NASA’S FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

ON CEV MANAGEMENT

If I might, I would like to direct questions to Mr. Cobb, Mr. Kutz.
And  then  Ms.  Sykes,  if  you  want  to  add  your  two  bits,  please  free
to do so.

We all know we have this major exploration initiative underway.
Estimates that—are that it will cost $100 billion between now and
2018.  How  confident  are  you  that  NASA  will  be  able  to  effectively
manage  all  of  these  projects,  given  the  state  of  its  financial  man-
agement  system?  And  will  Congress  be  able  to  get  the  information
it  needs  to  meet  these—our  oversight  responsibilities?  And  then  if
you  have  some  lack  of  confidence,  what  would  it—would  have  to
happen for you to be confident?

Mr. COBB. Having just made an error maybe in terms of specula-
tion,  it  is  probably  safer  to  say  that,  from  my  standpoint,  we  are
going to be auditing these activities and—from the Office of Inspec-

tor General in terms of the expenditure of the taxpayers’ dollars on
the President’s vision.

If  history  is  any  help,  as  a  history  major  in  college,  I  would  say
one  might  conclude  that—might  have  a  lack  of  confidence  in  the
ability of NASA to deliver with—on the dime.

Mr. KUTZ. I would say that——
Mr. UDALL. Mr. Kutz?
Mr.  KUTZ.—I  am  certainly  hopeful  but  not  confident  at  this
point.  And  again,  back  to  a  prior  comment  I  have  made,  I  have
been  asked  at  numerous  hearings  across  all  agencies  to  make  pre-
dictions  about  success,  and  I  have  learned  that  that  is  not  a  good
thing,  because  a  hearing  five  years  down  the  road  might—you
might  say,  ‘‘Well,  you  said  that  five  years  ago.  Things  might  get
better.’’

But again, I think back to—there are certain areas where I think
that  they  need  to  have  more  complete  plans,  and  one  area,  for  ex-
ample,  is  property  accounting.  And  I  think  just  a  fundamental
point  on  that  is  that  to  get  property  accounting  right,  you  have  to
record  it  correctly  at  the  point  of  the  transaction.  When  you  pur-
chase  something  or  you  make  a  payment  to  a  contractor,  if  you
don’t  record  it  properly  then,  you  are  in  a  catch-up  exercise.  And
that is where they are today. And so there is a lot of work that will
go into fixing something like that, such as readjusting the way con-
tracts  are  written,  the  kind  of  information  contractors  report  to
NASA,  the  way  that  the  system  is  configured  to  accept  that  infor-
mation to roll that up. So until we see a concrete plan, for example,
in that area, it is hard to predict that it will ever get fixed.

And again, some of the initiatives Mr. Ciganer and I have talked
about,  we  see  promise  in  those,  and  we  really  would  like  to  see
them carried forward.

IMPLEMENTING A NEW FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Mr.  UDALL.  Mr.  Calvert  and  I  are  discussing  the  fact  that  there
is  something  wrong  with  you  two  gentlemen,  because  everybody
else in this town speculates, and the fact that you are unwilling to
do  so  is  actually  a  credit,  and  we  do  appreciate  the  work,  in  gen-
eral, that IGs do and the GAO to do—to work diligently to try and
bring  us  the  factual  information  and  lay  it  out  for  us  and  then  let
the  facts  speak  for  themselves.  So  thank  you  for  the  work  you  do
that—in that regard.

Ms. Sykes, do you want to take your cut at my question?
Ms.  SYKES.  Well,  I  believe  NASA  excels  at  challenges,  and  that
is  something  that  we  do  best.  And  I  recognize  here,  as  your  CFO,
and  as  well  as  my  ten  Center  CFOs  that  are  here  supporting  me
today,  that  we  do  have  a  challenge  in  financial  management,  but
it is our intention, not only as a core group, but overall as an agen-
cy,  to  make  sure  that  we  are  providing  you  with  credible,  timely,
and accurate information. And that is—has been our goal since the
inception.  That  has  been  our  goal  since  we  have  implemented  the
new  Core  Finance  system,  implemented  full  cost,  and  as  we  move
forward in the Enterprise Management Program, implementing the
Contract  Management  module  to  get  back  to  this—what  Mr.  Kutz
is talking about, being able to receive information from our contrac-
tors to be able to blend and meld that with our transactional data-

base  information  that  we  have  on  our  current  financial  manage-
ment, and moving forward.

I  am  definitely  hopeful.  I  am  not  going  to  speculate,  but  I  will
say  I  am  definitely  hopeful,  because  again,  what  kept  me  up  at
night  in  2003,  trying  to  prepare  financial  statements.  What  keeps
me up at night in 2005? Being able to see this come to fruition and
being  able  to  be  a  real,  true  business  enterprise,  moving  forward,
and supporting the space exploration vision.

Mr.  UDALL.  Well,  it  is  clear  that  you  bring  a  professional  back-
ground and a deep commitment to this effort. I want to thank you
for  what  you  are  doing,  and  I  know  that  the  next  time  that  you
have—appear  before  us,  you  will  be  able  to  answer  in  the  affirma-
tive when Mr. Calvert asks you about Sarbanes-Oxley. That would
be the goal, I believe.

Ms. SYKES. I am only thankful I am a federal CFO and not a pri-
vate  CFO,  but  I  believe  myself  and  my  agency  CFOs,  we  have  al-
ready  started  that  practice  and  process  of  signing  accountability
statements.  That  was  not  something  that  this  agency  did  when
we—when  I  first  came  on  board.  So  now,  when  I  turn  over  my  fi-
nancial statements and produce my performance and accountability
report, not only do I sign and the Administrator signs, but also the
ten  individuals  behind  me.  And  probably  future,  and  maybe  if  the
Committee  would  like  to  help,  we  could  get  the  mission  directors
to  also  sign  up,  because  that  is  part  of  what  Sarbanes-Oxley  is  all
about:  making  sure  that  everybody  in  the  organization  who  has  a
financial  impact  or  financial  process  within  their  purview  has  to
sign  up  for  the  internal  controls  to  make  sure  that  they  are  man-
aging our funds properly.

Mr. UDALL. And anybody who pays a little bit of attention under-
stands  that  government  accounting  is  different  from  the  for-profit
world,  although  there  are  many  overlaps,  and  I  think  it  is  incum-
bent on us to do everything we can to equal what the private sector
does. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.

So thank you, again, panel——
Mr.  LI.  Mr.  Udall,  I  am  not  going  to  speculate,  but  you  asked  a
question  with  regards  to  what  can  be  done,  and  I  would  like  to
kind of answer that question, if I could.

I think that one of the issues that we have been talking to here,
both in our report and some of the issues, is that the level of speci-
ficity of the data being provided by the contractors is not sufficient
for NASA to do the sort of program management and careful moni-
toring of the contracts. What I would suggest, respectfully suggest,
is  that  perhaps  contracts,  like  the  CEV,  that  are  coming  up  could
be  pilots  in  which,  while  the  system  is  not  totally  implemented,
that  could  be  the  pilot  by  which  we  would  cause  whoever  the  win-
ner of the—of that contract is coming on board, to provide the sort
of data that we would need.

That is what I suggest.
Chairman  CALVERT.  That  would  be  good.  We  don’t  want  to  have
to  go  through  what  we  went  through,  I  hate  to  say,  on  the  F&A–
22  where  we  keep  picking  up  that  price  on  the—on  a—we  don’t
want  that  to  happen  to  the  CEV.  We  just  don’t  have  the  money  to
do that.

CONTRACTOR OVERSIGHT

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Yes. Thank you very much.
And  let  me  note  that  I  just  had  a  meeting,  and—that  I  will  re-
turn  to  in  the  outer  office  there,  with  Commander  Eileen  Collins,
who  was  our  great  astronaut  and  Commander  of  the  Shuttle,  of
course, that we are so proud of. And that—being proud of the peo-
ple  who  are  doing  the  job  at  NASA,  whether  it  is  on  the  ground
or whether they are the ones who are actually flying the missions,
this is not in question today. We are proud of these people, and we
are  grateful  for  the  good  job  that  those  people  do.  The  question  is
what  is  the  most  efficient  way  of  doing  the  job  and  once  NASA  is
doing that part of the job, how to effectively account for the money
so that—and the spending of that money so that the mission is ac-
complished  and  our  people  are  able  to  come  home  safely  when  it
is a manned mission.

Let  me  just  note,  I  reject  the  idea  that  there  has  been  too  much
outsourcing.  As  far  as  I  am  concerned,  there  hasn’t  been  enough
outsourcing. When given a choice as to who to hire to complete the
job  on  some  of  these  engineering  projects,  I  do  not  believe  that  it
is better to hire our—or it is better to let Sergeant Bilco do the job
rather than hiring Mr. Goodwrench. I mean, that is what it comes
down to.

Public  employees  have  limitations;  private  sector  people  have
limitations.  And  there  are  strengths  and  weaknesses  both  in  hav-
ing a government employee do the job, and there is a weakness, as
well,  in  having  government  employees  do  the  jobs,  because  there
are a certain lack of incentives at that level. In short, Burt Rutan,
I  would  certainly—if  I—we  are  going  to  set  out  a  mission,  we  can
let  Burt  Rutan  do  the  mission  and  offer  a  price  to  do  that  and  get
the  private  sector  involved.  That  is  a  lot  better—to  me,  it  seems  a
lot  more  effective  use  of  government  money,  limited  government
money,  than  to  simply  have  the  NASA  bureaucracy  do  the  job,  be-
cause it seems to me that we have a history that indicates that bu-
reaucracy  does  not  necessarily  accomplish  the  missions  in  a  most
cost-effective way.

Now in terms of financial accounting, it may make things a little
bit more difficult, however, in an age of computerization, I don’t be-
lieve  that  that  type  of  complication  is  an  excuse  for  not  having
proper  accounting.  I  mean,  maybe  in  the  past  where  you  really
didn’t  have  this  instantaneous  communication,  but  today,  that
doesn’t  make  sense.  It  is  not  an  excuse,  and  we  can  oversee  con-
tractors  in  the  same  way  that  we  oversee  government  employees.
That is possible. That is, at least, my perspective.

And  I  want  to  throw  that  out  to  the  GAO  people  or  anyone  else
who would like to comment on that. Is it not possible for us to over-
see contractors in an efficient way?

Mr. KUTZ. I will go first and let Mr. Li comment.
But  yeah,  I  think  that  the—it  is  not  a  reason  or  an  excuse  that
we  can’t  be  successful  in  implementing  an  integrated  financial
management  and  business  system  or  transforming  the  way  that
business is done. So from that perspective, there is the technology.
And  certainly  this  SAP  software  package  that  they  are  using  here

should be capable of addressing whether they are in a contract-out
environment or a government employee environment.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. Well, I would hope so.
And let me note——
Mr. CIGANER. If I may, I——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Sure.
Mr. CIGANER.—am in full agreement with Mr. Kutz.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay.
Mr. CIGANER. Our objective since day one, since the implementa-
tion  of  our  plan,  has  been  to  take  into  account  those  complex  con-
tracts,  and  there  has  been  no  effort  to  simplify  processes.  I  mean,
we  are  basically  delivering,  you  are  right,  tools  that  are  meeting
those requirements. We are not going to make the requirements fit
the tools. We are building what needs to be built.

RESTRUCTURING NASA FOR THE BENEFIT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTABILITY

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. One of the things that I am—well, first
of  all,  let  me  state  this  for  the  record.  The  reason  why  we  want  to
have  a  good  financial  accounting  system  is  so  we  will  not  have  to
make  emergency  appropriations.  Emergency  appropriations  be-
cause  something  is  now  cost  $4  billion  more  than  we  thought  it
would  is  not  the  way  to  have  a  well-run  program  and  the  most
cost-effective way to have a space program, because you are bound
to,  in  emergency  appropriations,  not  do  the  most  effective  thing  if
you have long-run planning. So this financial examination today is
aimed  at  trying  to  do  a  long—utilize  the  taxpayers’  money  so  that
Commander  Collins  and  others  will  come  home  safely  and  accom-
plish their mission.

But  one  last  thought,  and  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  that—and  I
would  like  a  comment  from  the  panel,  and  that  is  this  isn’t  just
about the way the money is handled and the financial system that
we  have  of  accounting  for  the  money.  This  problem  may  be  to  the
point  that  we  have  set  up  a  structure  in  NASA  with  the  various
Centers  that  are  somewhat  independent  that  make  that  job—
that—rather  than  outsourcing,  it  may  be  the  structure  of  NASA
itself that makes this financial accounting much more difficult. And
maybe  we  should  try  to—I  know  it  is  hard  to  think  about  revolu-
tionary change in structure of an organization like NASA, but per-
haps  that  is  what  will  be  required  to  have  the  level  of  accounting
that  we  need  to  feel  comfortable  with  with  all  of  these  billions  of
dollars being spent.

And I would ask anyone in the panel to comment on that, if they

would like.

Mr.  COBB.  I  would  like  to  comment  on  why  we  need  to  know
what  we  have  spent  is  important  in  terms  of  not  only  the  appro-
priations process, but it is also, you know, critical so that you know
what  you  have  spent,  as  you  have  spent  it,  so  that  as  you  face
budget  issues,  for  example,  you  can  set  your  priorities  and  make
intelligent decisions as you are going along.

On the point about the Centers, there is no question that wheth-
er  you  are  talking  about  financial  management,  you  are  talking
about  information  technology,  if  you  are  talking  about  procure-
ment.  These  institutional  functions  are  made  much  more  com-

83

plicated when you have a management structure that is decentral-
ized.

Mr. KUTZ. I would comment, also, on your first point with respect
to  the  transparency  of  information  that  you  get  in  overseeing
NASA’s programs. I mean, one of the goals here is, in fact, so that
it  won’t  necessarily—having  the  information  won’t  necessarily  pre-
vent  cost  overruns  and  things  like  that,  but  hopefully  you  will
know  sooner  that  there  is  an  issue  so  it  can  be  dealt  with  rather
than  getting  a  $4  or  $5  billion  surprise.  So  I  think  that  is  one  of
the goals here.

On  the  structure,  I  would  agree  with  Mr.  Cobb  that  that  has
been historically a challenge to break down the cultural barriers of
the  different  Centers,  very  similar  to  DHS  and  the  Department  of
Defense with the different pieces that they have got trying to oper-
ate  at  one  platform  with  consistent  policies  and  procedures.  And
again, what Ms. Sykes said earlier, I think they are trying to head
in the right direction in that area.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. How about Ms. Sykes?
Chairman CALVERT. Ms. Sykes, go ahead.
Ms. SYKES. Oh, not a problem.
Yeah,  and  we  are  addressing  that,  sir,  in  our  area,  as  you—as
I noted in my opening testimony and in my testimony. When I first
came to NASA, all ten Center CFOs reported directly to the Center
directors,  not  to  the  Agency  CFO.  Now,  today,  they  all  report  di-
rectly  to  me.  And  that  is  just  one  of  the  areas.  But  as  Mr.  Cobb
and Mr. Li have pointed out, we still have CIO functions, we have
procurement  functions,  but  they  don’t  necessarily  report  to  the
Agency  head  at  this  point  in  time.  I  am  the  only  proponent  right
now that has that structure.

Chairman CALVERT. Thank you.
Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I  would  not  want  to  suggest  in  the  Committee  that  has  worked
in such a bipartisan way that our philosophical differences does not
ultimately result in us finding some solutions.

DEVELOPING A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN

Ms.  Sykes,  you  have  made  some  excellent  points,  and  I  am  de-
lighted that your CFO officers from the different Centers are here.
I  think  you  have  made  an  important  step  in  the  central  reporting
process. And frankly, I am going to recommend that the CIO in the
procurement process be handled accordingly.

I  would  appreciate  it  if  you  would  provide  for  me,  and  you  can
do  that  in  coordination  with  your  procurement,  the  list  of  inde-
pendent,  outside  contracts  that  you  are  presently  monitoring,  that
are  presently  under  your  financial  umbrella.  In  addition,  include
the  breakdown  between  large  and  minority  and  small  business  so
that  either  that  multiplies  your  responsibility  or  it  does  not.  You
can,  you  know,  provide  that  accordingly.  [See  Appendix  2:  Addi-
tional Material for the Record.]

The  other  question,  and  let  me  ask  my  questions,  and  I  think
that  works  very  well,  and  make  sure  that  individuals  are  allowed
to  answer  them,  I  still  believe  that  the  complexity  of  the  process

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

84

of  NASA  with  large  and  small  and  medium-sized  contracts  in  a
large  number,  does  provide  a  different  process  and  complexity.
Would  you,  if  I  missed  it,  give  me  the  sense  of  when  you  believe
the  plan  that  is  being  asked  for  by  the  Inspector  General  where
you  are  at  a  comfort  level,  a  new  plan  can  either  be  activated  and
what  stage  it  is  at?  You  may  have  answered  that,  but  I  want  to
do that.

And  let  me  do  this  so  that  I  can  likewise  get  the  questions  in

that I ask.

Mr.  Li,  you  did  not  answer  the  question,  because  my  time  had
run out. So I want you to again—I want to raise the question about
outsourcing  procurement  and  what  you  sense  is  the  structure  at
NASA and how it can be improved.

Mr.  Kutz,  if  you  can  again  go  back  to  your  commentary  about,
well,  it  is  no  big  deal.  NASA  is  along  with  the  others  who  are  not
complying and don’t—and have complex situations. You need to go
back  to  that  and  give  me  the  list  of  entities,  agencies  that  have
that.  Maybe  you  want  to  use  the  DoD  as  the  largest  offender,  but
then what is the solution? Is the solution just to accept that or not?
Ms.  Sykes,  would  you  go  forward  with  the  plans  and  the  time

frame that you think that we can see a plan?

Ms. SYKES. Sure. Thank you, ma’am.
Just  to  make  sure  that  we  comply  with  your  additional  request
on  information  regarding  contractors,  we  will  be  getting  with  you
and  your  staff  to  ensure  that  we  give  you  a  complete  listing
and——

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you.
Ms. SYKES.—make sure that we have that information.
As  far  as  the  plan,  one  of  the  benefits  of  my  job  is  I  get  to  meet
with  my  Inspector  General  on  a  daily—on  a  weekly  basis.  As  a
matter  of  fact,  we  meet  every  Monday.  So  that  was  one  of  the  key
topics regarding the plan. Again, we, at NASA, have developed sev-
eral  different  plans.  Myself  and  Patrick  work  continually  as  we
keep  revising  and  implementing  as  we  move  forward,  due  to
changes, due to architectural changes.

What  we  are  going  to  look  for  right  now,  and  hopefully  in  order
to  solve  both  the  Committee’s  requests  and  also  your  requests  and
the  IG  and  GAO’s  requests,  is  we  are  going  to  take  a  more  tradi-
tional  approach  and  develop  what  we  call  a  corrective  action  plan.
And we will be working with the IG to architect what are the com-
ponents of that traditional approach. And we have both agreed, on
this past Monday, that we would provide that within 90 days after
our November 15 audit report.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. All right. So 90 days. Very good.

OUTSOURCING

I  would  like  to  recommend  that  we  look  at  the  question  of  the
CIO  and  the  procurement  reporting  to  central  headquarters.  I
think  that  provides  a  consistency,  and  it  also  provides  the  correc-
tive oversight that I think needs to occur here in the United States
Congress. So I would just recommend that.

I  will  let  you  comment,  but  let  me  go  ahead  to  over  here  to  Mr.
Kutz  and  Mr.  Li  on  this  procurement  issue  and  outsourcing  as  it
relates to NASA.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00090 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

85

Mr.  LI.  I—on  the  issue  of—the  questions  you  had  with  regards
to  the  CEV,  I  don’t  have  an  active  engagement  right  now.  NASA
is in the midst of its solicitation for that particular vehicle.

Let me note that the CEV is no more of an outsourcing issue any

more than the Space Station or the Shuttle. They are both——

Ms. JACKSON LEE. What would you see the outsourcing and pro-

curement problems at NASA?

Mr.  LI.  And  I  am  glad  you  asked  that  question,  because  this  is
something that has concerned me throughout the government, and
it  is  the  issue  of  when  we  do  have  contractors  that  the  contract
monitor,  on  the  part  of  the  government,  is  losing  technical  exper-
tise, because they don’t have enough hands-on on how to do things.
And as a result, if they are evaluating the work of the contractors,
it  is  getting  harder  and  harder  for  them  to  get  the  job  done.  And
I have heard that throughout all agencies.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  So  in  doing  so,  then  they  are  not  sure  if  they
are getting their money’s worth, because they don’t have the exper-
tise to see what is being submitted by the contractor?
Mr. LI. That is the trend that I am worried about.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  And  that  is  an  element  of  improvement  that
we  need  to  assess,  as  Members  of  Congress,  and  possibly  legisla-
tively.

Mr. Kutz, if I am pronouncing your name——
Mr. KUTZ. Kutz, yeah.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Kutz. Thank you very much.

NASA COMPARED TO OTHER AGENCIES

Mr. KUTZ. With respect to who you can compare NASA to in the
government,  the  most  similar  entities,  from  a  contracting-out  and
a  capital-intensive  nature,  would  be  the  Department  of  Defense
and  Department  of  Energy.  And  those  two  are  at  kind  of  opposite
ends  of  the  spectrum.  The  Department  of  Energy  is  one  of  the
agencies,  I  believe,  that  has  compliant  systems  and  has  fewer  no
material  weaknesses  and  controls  and  I  believe  is  one  of  the  ones
on the better side of the equation.

The  one—the  Department  of  Defense  is  the  one  whose  problem
may  not  be  solvable  any  time  ever,  possibly.  And  so  NASA  would
possibly be in the middle. But comparing NASA to, like, the Social
Security  Administration,  is  probably  not  fair.  The  operations  are
very  different.  Social  Security  is  a  disbursement  organization.
NASA  has  a  lot  more  complexity,  and  the  degree  of  difficulty  is
much harder.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Are  you  saying  the  Department  of  Defense

does not have a reputable compliance system in place?

Mr. KUTZ. No, they don’t.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  But,  Ms.  Sykes,  you  believe  that  NASA  has

the capability of such a system to be put in place?

Ms.  SYKES.  Correct.  And  my  Program  Executive  Officer  will,

hopefully, echo that.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Yes?
Mr. CIGANER. Yes, I——
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Is  it  in  place  now,  or  you  are  looking  to  put

such in place?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00091 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

86

Mr. CIGANER. It is not in place yet. We have several components.
This  is—a  lot  of  individual  elements,  as  I  mentioned  earlier,  were
about halfway there. Our aim is by 2008 to have it in place.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. 2008?
Mr. CIGANER. Yes.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  All  right.  But  you  are  working  on  a  compli-

ant—is it halfway working?

Mr.  CIGANER.  Several  components  are  already—it  is  not  half
working or not. Several of the elements have been deployed and are
operating, but the overall requirements have not been satisfied yet.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Mr.  Chairman,  as  you  indulge,  I  just  want  to

finish with Mr. Cobb, and I will finish.

Mr. Cobb, if you have been listening today to the testimony, com-
pliance  systems,  a  plan  in  place,  we  hear  some  difficulties  with
outsourcing. Do you see this as a fixable challenge?

Mr. COBB. Absolutely. It—you know, it—but from my standpoint,
it has got—has to be implemented from a top-down standpoint. You
have  to  have  an  architecture.  You  have  to  have  strategies.  You
have got to know where you want to go, and then design steps that
will get you there.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentlelady.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you.
Chairman CALVERT. Mr. Platts.

IMPROPER PAYMENTS

Mr. PLATTS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to turn to the issue of improper payments.
My predecessor in the Subcommittee as Chair, Steve Horne, had
been  a  great  leader  in  this  issue  and  spots  of  the  legislation  of
2002.  In  the  2004,  there  was  some  concern  about  compliance  with
the Improper Payments Act of 2002 by NASA and the failure to es-
timate improper payments, and in some of my interactions with the
Agency, that concern is, I guess, heightened that we are not really
being serious about this.

So  can  you  give  us  an  update  about  where  you  believe  you  are
in full compliance, you know, in trying to comply with the Improper
Payments Act?

Ms. SYKES. Correct. Improper Payments Act is something that we
take quite serious here at NASA. We have actually had the ability,
particularly  with  Administrator  Griffin  coming  on  board,  in  order
to  put  a  contract  in  place  in  order  to  go  out  and  do  the  assess-
ments,  in  order  to  make  sure  that  we  have  the  proper  review,  be-
cause  beforehand  we  had  been  relying  mostly  and  specifically  on
Defense  Contract  Audit  Agency,  and,  recognizing  that  they  are
pretty much stretched, also, we needed to bring in some additional
horsepower,  and  that  is  what  we  did  at  NASA  in  order  to  make
sure  that  we  have  true  coverage.  Because  as  what  has  been  pre-
sented  here  by  the  Committee,  we  are  approximately  80  percent
contracted out. That is one of the areas that I have to keep diligent
vigilance on in order to ensure there is no fraud, waste, and abuse
in that area.

Mr.  PLATTS.  Is  your  reason  for  not  having  done  an  estimate  in
the  2004  financials—that  is  one  of  the  issues  that,  you  know,  in
compliance is what is your estimate and not only what is your esti-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

87

mate,  then,  you  know,  what  are  you—steps  are  you  taking  to  be
proactive  to  guard  against  these  types  of  improper  payments,  be-
cause it—the audit agency is kind of after the fact, and you go out
and  find  them.  But  what  we  are  really  trying  to  do  is  prevent
them.

Ms.  SYKES.  Prevent  them  in  the  beginning.  I  would  like  to  come
back  to  the  record  on  that  in  order  to  be  able  to  tell  you  what  we
did  in  2004,  what  we  have  done  for  the  estimates,  and  how  we
have moved forward and provide that for the record.

Mr. PLATTS. Okay.

INFORMATION FOR THE RECORD

Subsequent  to  receipt  of  its  FY  2004  audit  report,  NASA  improved  its  Improper
Payments  Information  Act  (IPIA)  procedures  by  entering  into  a  multi-year  contract
with  a  recovery  audit  firm.  The  scope  of  work  for  the  contract  includes  conducting
audit  recovery  procedures  on  all  contract  and  vendor  payments;  recovering  pay-
ments  that  were  made  improperly;  and  providing  reports  that  will  help  NASA  im-
prove internal controls regarding the payment process. The contract stipulates that
the firm will be paid based on a percentage of improper payments that they identify
and  recover.  In  2006,  NASA  will  continue  to  strengthen  its  procedures  for  moni-
toring improper payments.

Mr.  PLATTS.  Mr.  Cobb  and  Mr.  Kutz,  your  view  on  compliance

with the Improper Payments Act, as we stand today?

Mr.  COBB.  My  understanding  is  that  where  NASA  had  a  non-
compliance was that, in connection with implementing the act, that
they considered the fixed price contracts, but that they failed to in-
clude the cost-type contracts in the assessment and that that is the
root of the problem

Mr. PLATTS. In the 2004 audit?
Mr. COBB. Yes.
Mr.  PLATTS.  And  it  is  your  belief  that  actions  have  been  taken

in the 2005 year to try to address that?

Mr.  COBB.  I  have  got  nothing  that  verifies  that  those  actions

have been taken?

Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Kutz.
Mr. KUTZ. No comment on that.
Mr. PLATTS. Okay.

CONTRACT MANAGEMENT MODULE

Separate  issue.  Contract  Management  module,  a  key  when  we
talk  about,  you  know,  getting  on  top  of  this  issue  of  contract  man-
agement,  the  concern  has  been  raised  with  me  that  it  really  is
going  to  be  more  about  writing  contracts  and  providing  the  forms
and  things  but  not  truly  oversight  of  the  contracts  and  truly  man-
aging them, as opposed to just having a uniformity on how they are
presented.  And  I  would  be  interested  in  your  opinion,  Mr.  Ciganer
or Ms. Sykes.

Mr. CIGANER. The Contract Management module, as a module in
itself, is, above all, you are correct, focused on generating contracts
that  are  both  traceable  and  clearly  structured  so  all  of  the  over-
sight  and  reporting  related  to  those  contracts  can  be  facilitated.
What  is  really  an  additional  component  of  managing  contracts
more  efficiently,  what  the  GAO  is  focused  on,  is  actually  the  mod-
ules that are related to enhance project management. For example,
earned value management is applicable in quite a few of our activi-

88

ties.  That  will  sit  on  top  of  the  Contract  Management  module.  It
is not part of that specific effort, but it is an activity that is sched-
uled to also be rolled out in the next three years.

Mr. PLATTS. What is the time frame for that to be——
Mr. CIGANER. We——
Ms. SYKES. Actually, if we could cue the charts, I know we have
charts there, and go to the last chart, because I—keep going. Next
chart. Next chart. Next chart. Right there.

Just  to  give  an  idea,  every  time  we  keep  talking  about  the  sys-
tem,  and  we  keep  trying  to  tell  you  that  we  are  almost  there  or

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

89

part  way  there,  if—Patrick,  do  you  want  to  walk  through  your—
this is our famous planning chart.

Mr.  CIGANER.  To  really  look  at  the  monitor  in  detail,  but  I  can
tell  you  that  the  earned  value  management  functionality  is  sched-
uled  to  be  deployed  by  2008,  along  with  some  of  the  project  man-
agement  improvement  activities,  which  have  started  now  in  the
Contract  Management  module.  So  again,  this  is  a  series  of  steps.
So  we  would  like  to  be  able  to  present  to  GAO  the  tools  that  are
needed  to  hopefully  get  us  off  the  high-risk  by  the  end  of  that  pe-
riod.

By  the  way,  we  have  developed  a  plan  with  GAO  on  what  are
the  steps  needed  to  get  the  Agency  off  the  high-risk  list.  And  the
plan  is  not  only  systems,  but  it  is  also  changing  the  way  some  of
our  processes  are  taking  place  and  also  changing,  and  that  is  the
discussion, the way the Agency manages its major programs, which
is  get  the  cost  trade-off  element  embedded  into  the  programmatic
community as opposed to being something that maybe the financial
community is responsible.

Mr. PLATTS. If I am reading the chart right on the Contract Man-
agement,  it  talks  about  roll-out  now  and  implementation,  you
know, over this year, basically. But the actual follow-through to ac-
tually  make  that  information  more  meaningful,  from  an  oversight,
will be another two years later. Is that——

Mr. CIGANER. That is correct, because the other thing is the Con-
tract  Management  tool  is  obviously  going  to  be  used  for  new  con-
tracts.  The  goal  is  to  eventually  get  the  majority  of  our  existing
contract rolled out into that information environment. That, in ad-
dition to the tool being able to process them, is going to take some
additional time.

Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Kutz, did you have a comment on where we are

and how——

Mr. KUTZ. I would. I think——
Mr. PLATTS.—effective it is going to be?
Mr.  KUTZ.  Absolutely.  I  think  Mr.  Li  made  a  great  point  earlier
in  talking  about  some  of  the  new  programs.  I  mean,  that  is  the
time  to  really  start  changing  the  way  contracts  are  written  and
what  information  is  required  from  contractors  so—and  that  is
something that you, from an oversight perspective, can try to make
sure  happens  with  NASA.  I  don’t  know  how  you  will  do  that  ex-
actly,  but  that  is  something  that  if  they  don’t  do  that,  2008  will
come,  and  we  might  implement  new  software  but  not  change  our
processes  and  contracts,  and  we  will  have  the  same  data  quicker,
but it will not be the kind of data we need.

So  there  is  a  lot  of  work  to  actually  do  with  respect  to  re-
engineering  the  contracting  and  the  processes  and  the  configura-
tion of the data coming. And that is not easy, because if you think
about a lot of NASA’s contracts, they are very long-term in nature,
so the question is what do you do with the other contracts that are
already in place that are going to run past 2008? And so there are
a lot of issues to deal with there.

Mr. PLATTS. But your assessment is that there is a detailed effort
underway  to  get  us  to  that  2008  goal,  you  know,  at  least  for  the
new contracts and then oversight of where we stand today? We are
moving——

Mr. KUTZ. I wouldn’t go as far as saying we see 2008—something
happening. We have seen promising steps that recognize the depth
of the problem and the things that need to be done, and I wouldn’t
go  any  further  than  that.  And  so  those—I  haven’t  seen  them  for-
mulated into a real action plan, as Mr. Cobb was talking about, as
to how you get from knowing where you are trying to go to having
the steps to get you there.

Mr.  PLATTS.  Okay.  I  have  one  or  two  others,  but  my  time  is  up,

and I don’t know if we will have another round.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Well,  I,  unfortunately—unless  you  want  to
go—continue  to  Chair  the  meeting,  I  have  an  appointment  I  have
to get to, so if you want to go ahead and continue the——

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman——
Mr. PLATTS. I don’t mind if I——
Chairman  CALVERT.  I  will  do  my  last  real  quick  statement,  and

then you can continue the hearing, if you——

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman——
Chairman CALVERT.—would like.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  If—when  you  do  your  statement,  I  just  want
to  yield  to  you  for  an  inquiry,  and  then  I  am  going  to  let  him  con-
tinue on, but——

Chairman  CALVERT.  Just  basically,  to  Mr.  Cobb  and  Mr.  Kutz,  I
would  just  like  you  to,  in  writing  to  the  Committee,  please  lay  out
the top three or four issues that NASA needs to address, and what
progress  they  need  to  make  in  the  next  12  months  where  we  can
continue  our  oversight  role.  If  you  could  get  that  and  submit  that
for the record.

And  Ms.  Sykes,  based  upon  your  testimony,  I  understand  ap-
proximately February 15 we can expect that you will have the cor-
rective action plan to submit to the Committee?

Ms. SYKES. Correct.
Chairman CALVERT. Okay. For the record, I just wanted to make

sure that that is the date, February 15.

Again, I want to thank this committee for coming out today, and
this  is  a  difficult  problem.  We  are  not  going  to  back  away  from  it.
We will continue to pursue this. We want to get this thing straight-
ened  out  as  we  move  forward  on  our  new  architecture  in  outer
space.  We  want  to  make  sure  that  we  have  sufficient  financial
records to make sure we do things properly.

And with that——
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, would you——
Chairman CALVERT.—your inquiry.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Yes, I would.
And  I  thank  you  very  much.  I  echo  your  comments,  Mr.  Chair-
man, and look forward to the written material and look forward to
the written material I have asked Ms. Sykes for.

I  would  just  simply  say  that  I  think  out  of  the  testimony  today,
Mr.  Chairman,  I  hope,  though  we  don’t  want  to  legislate  every  as-
pect  of  the  management  of  NASA,  that  we  will  recognize  they  are
unique. 80 percent of them are—80 percent contracted. That is not
bad,  but  they  are  unique.  And  I  would  hope  that  there  may  be
some legislative efforts that we can generate that would be helpful
to  their  systems  and  to  their  process  and  that  we  can  get  NASA

back  on  its  mission,  or  maybe  focusing  on  its  mission,  because  of
course, its financial systems will be in order.

And  I  thank  the  witnesses,  and  particularly  Ms.  Sykes,  for  the
strides  that  you  have  made  with  your  CFOs.  We  appreciate  it
greatly.

I yield back.
Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentlelady.
And I turn it over to Mr. Platts.
Mr.  PLATTS.  [Presiding]  Just  a  couple  other  follow-up  before  we
wrap  up,  and  I,  again,  appreciate  the  Chairman  allowing  me  to
continue here for a few minutes.

RECONCILIATING FUND BALANCE WITH TREASURY

One of the issues we have had a lot of discussions on is the Fund
Balance  issue  with  Treasury,  and  I  thought  it  would  be  helpful  to
maybe  just  have  a  quick  assessment  of,  you  know,  where  we  be-
lieve  we  are  from  both  the  CFO’s  Office  as  well  as  IG  and  GAO.
And  I  think  this  brings  to  light  one  of  the  things  that  is  a  chal-
lenge.  Mr.  Ciganer  earlier  talked  about  historical  data,  corrections
or  recapturing  a  lot  of  this  information.  And  if  I  remember  the  in-
formation  share  correctly,  that  in  one  of  the—that  instead  of  hav-
ing—writing  off  or  writing  up  some  accounts  receivable  from  the
1960s was something that you were dealing with, that——

Mr. CIGANER. That is correct.
Mr.  PLATTS.—I  think,  does  kind  of  go  to  the  challenge  before  us
as we are trying to get all of our information, not just new informa-
tion  going  forward,  but  what  we  already  have,  accurately  reported
and able to be relied on in going forward.

But  Ms.  Sykes,  if  you  want  to  give  where  we  are  a  year  ago,  we
had,  roughly,  a  $2  billion  imbalance.  And  my  understanding  is  we
are down into the tens of millions from that $2 billion figure.

Ms.  SYKES.  Sure.  Also,  if  I  could  have  them  cue  up  the  slides

again. It will be the first slide. Right there, sir. Thank you.

As  you  will  notice,  in  2003,  when  I  closed  our  books,  we  had  a
$1.743  billion  difference  in  our  books,  those  that  were  recorded  in
our  Core  Finance  versus  what  was  at  Treasury.  Since  that  time
frame, when I closed the books this year, September 2005, we have
a  $46.5  million  difference.  That  difference  is  made  up  of  approxi-
mately  $36  million  in  intergovernmental  transfers,  which  every
agency  is  dealing  with  and  having  to  deal  with,  and  then  the  rest,
approximately  $10  million,  is  associated  with  timing  differences
and reconciliation issues that we are still working with at the Cen-
ter level.

But  we  have  a  reconciliation  process  that  we  have  put  in  place
and that we are operating under by which all ten Center CFOs are
required  to  reconcile  their  individual  accounts  at  the  Center  level
with  the  Fund  Balance  with  Treasury,  and  they  are  to  certify  to
that each month. So therefore, we are keeping our hands and eyes
and  hearts  on  the  Fund  Balance  with  Treasury  as  we  move  for-
ward.  So  this  includes  both  historical  and  current,  that  $46.5  mil-
lion.

Mr.  PLATTS.  Mr.  Cobb  and  Mr.  Kutz,  your  assessment  of  where
we  are  in—or  not  just  the  improvement  from  where  we  looked  at
a  year  ago,  but  the  processes  that  are  in  place  to  sustain  the  good

news,  I  think  that,  we  have  addressed  a  lot  of  that  unbalancing
going  forward  and  the  ability  to  continue  to  be  accurate  in  that
fund balance discrepancies.

Mr.  COBB.  On  the  good  news  side,  the  Office  of  Chief  Financial
Officer  has  instituted  some  controls  at  the  Center  level  and  some
policies  pursuant  to  which  the  Centers  are  to  reconcile  Fund  Bal-
ance with Treasury, and that is a positive step. We haven’t verified
the  content  of  those,  but  inherently,  that  is  something  that  had  to
be done and has been done.

In terms of the articulation and the information that was on the
chart,  it  is  very  difficult  to  rely  on  the  numbers  to  tell  the  story.
And the reason is that behind each of those numbers that are rep-
resented, there might be a number of transactions that balance off
each  other.  So  instead  of,  in  effect,  one  checkbook  where  you  have
a net amount that is, in effect, the amount that you are out of bal-
ance  with  the  bank,  there  might  be  a  whole  bunch  of  different
checkbooks.  And  one  checkbook  might  be  out  of  balance  one  way,
and the other checkbook might be out of balance another way, and
then when you add it all up, in effect, what you have got is a small
number. And that really doesn’t give you the full story.

So  my  understanding  is  that  the  Fund  Balance  with  Treasury
issue  is  going  to  remain  a  material  weakness  in  the  2005  audit.
You  know,  until  the  auditors,  until  my  office  can  get  an  under-
standing  of  what  those  numbers  represent  when  they  are  rep-
resented  to  us,  in  terms  of  what  are  the  problems  that  underlie
them,  and  that  they  can  see  an  audit  trail  that  explain  how  those
reconciliations  are  made,  then  I  won’t  be  able  to  come  before  you
and say that, you know, ‘‘Gee, this problem has been fixed.’’

Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Kutz.
Mr.  KUTZ.  I  would  defer  to  Mr.  Cobb  on  the  details,  but  this  is
obviously a very important issue, a fundamental issue, primarily a
human  capital  issue,  and  one  that  I  agree  with  Mr.  Cobb  that  the
gross is just as important as the net, in many respects, because we
have  looked  at  this,  and  your  predecessor,  Mr.  Horne,  had  a  hear-
ing years ago where another agency was doing something like that,
and again, I have no idea that this is the same case, but they were
hitting  canceled  appropriations  with  current  expenditures.  And  so
there are risks and things that can happen, so it is very important
that this is fully reconciled and addressed.

Mr.  PLATTS.  Ms.  Sykes,  your  response  to  the  specific  concerns
that  is—you  know,  the  net  versus  gross  issue  and  that  we  really
have  that  documentation  of  what  the  offsets  are  or  the  discrep-
ancies are, not just the total end number.

Ms. SYKES. Correct. We have been actually focusing on that, and
my  Office  of  Safety  and  Quality  Assurance  has  also  gone  out  and
not  only  reviewed  the  compliance  to  our  internal  controls  that  we
have  established  for  the  reconciliation  for  the  Fund  Balance  with
Treasury,  but  they  have  actually  went  out  and  actually  reviewed
the  policy,  making  sure  that  the  Center  CFOs  are  in  compliance
with that.

I  do  share  with  Mr.  Kutz  and  Mr.  Cobb,  I  was  getting  ready  to
call  him  ‘‘Moose’’  there—I  agree  with  Mr.  Cobb  with  regards  to
gross versus net. I mean, we have been looking at that. If you like,
we  can  kind  of  show  you  an  instance  as  to  how  we  view  gross

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00098 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

versus net, but again, it is—we have to track each and every trans-
action within our system. We just can’t go in and change one trans-
action.  We  have  to  put  something  in  and  push  something  out.  So
in doing so, you are going to have multiple transactions, which will
get you to a very big gross number. But again, we have to account
for and track those transactions.

Mr.  PLATTS.  If—the  way  I  understood  Mr.  Cobb’s  comment,
though,  it  wasn’t  as  much  that  that  is  not  accurate,  the  gross
versus  the  net,  and  I  would  appreciate  it  being  walked  through
that in how these numbers differ in our previous conversation, but
it  seems  like  what  he  is  really  going  after  is  what  is  generating
those  differences,  those—the—what  is  requiring  those  additions  or
subtractions  is  what  we  really  need  to,  you  know,  focus  on  to  ulti-
mately eliminate, you know, the problem at the beginning.

Ms. SYKES. Correct. And that is something that I also mentioned
in  my  opening  statement  with  regards  to  being  able  to  capture
those  transactions.  Prior  to  them  actually  going  into  our  system,
we recognize that we had some difficulties after 2003 with our con-
figuration.  We  have  implemented  what  we  call  compensating  con-
trols,  because  of  the  configuration  awaiting  the  new  upgrade  that
we were—are expecting in fiscal year 2006. So how can we capture,
track,  and  monitor  those  transactions  that  we  know  because  of
transfiguration  issues  are  going  to  go  in,  not  necessarily  erro-
neously,  but  differently  than  what  we  would  expect  to  be  able  to
see if we are providing a correct audit procedure? So we track that,
and  we  reconcile  that.  And  then  of  course,  as  our  users  have  actu-
ally  increased  in  their  knowledge  in  the  use  of  the  new  software,
we are finding that we are finding a little bit of a decrease in erro-
neous  transactions  also  going  into  our  system,  because  people  are
becoming more familiar with our system.

Mr. PLATTS. Sure. Thank you.
And Mr. Wu, did you have any questions?
Mr. WU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

FISCAL CONSTRAINTS

I  had  not  intended  to  express  any  thoughts  in  this  particular
hearing.  I—the  topic  of  this  hearing,  following  audit  trails  and
working  with  discrepancies  is  certainly  very,  very  important.  We
are  not  dealing  with  trivial  numbers  when  there  is  a  $1.7  billion
discrepancy  in  fiscal  year  2003.  My  recollection  was  that  the  last
Administrator,  one  of  the  things  that  was  supposed  to  be  accom-
plished was a much tighter set of fiscal control mechanisms.

But  I—Mr.  Chairman,  I  cannot  resist  this  opportunity  to  touch
on  an  area  of  policy  concern  that  I  have,  and  I  will  readily  admit
that  this  is  not  generally  within  the  purview  of  the  witnesses  cur-
rently here.

I have had a couple of conversations with both NASA people and
the  contractors  in  recent  times,  and  going  back  in  the  history  of
NASA, there are at least some who feel that in a race to the Moon
in the 1960s that we made some decisions that perhaps, if we were
in less of a hurry, we might have made those decisions differently.
And  it  is  terrific  that  we  won  the  race  to  the  Moon.  And  that  was
a  very,  very  important  thing  to  do.  But  then  we  had  a  complete
technologic shift to the Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle had some

94

fiscal  constraints  to  it  that  may  have  caused  some  subsequent
issues  with  that  program.  And  now  we  see  a  proposal  for  a  new
generation of human exploration of space.

It is my impression, and I intend to follow-up on this with discus-
sions  with  both  people  in  NASA  and  with  the  contracting  commu-
nity, is my impression that the proposals I have seen for this next
generation  of  space  vehicles,  every  bit  as  much  as  the  1960s  gen-
eration  was  somewhat  time-constrained  and,  perhaps,  rushed,  we
are fiscally constrained in what to do about this next generation of
vehicles and that because of these severe fiscal constraints, we may
not be taking the kinds of steps toward future generations of explo-
ration  that  would  more  logically  follow  or  more  wisely  follow,  in  a
policy  sense,  just  because  they  are  trying  to  accomplish  certain
things within tight budgets. And some people have denied that this
is  the  case,  and  other  folks  have  just  stepped  up  to  the  plate  and
said,  ‘‘Oh,  yeah.  This  is  completely  driven  by  the  funds  available.’’
And  I  intend,  in  coming  weeks,  months,  and  years,  to  further  ex-
plore  this  topic  to  see  whether  we  are  taking,  in  a  policy  sense,
wise  steps  for  a  long-term  vision  of  human  space  exploration  or
whether  we  are  embarking,  once  again,  as  we  have  in  some  dec-
ades in the past, down some courses which we will regret in a dec-
ade  or  two,  because  it  was  inappropriately  time  constrained  or  fis-
cally constrained.

I  know  that  you  all  are  here  talking  about  a  very  different  set
of  fiscal  controls.  I  respect  that  very  much,  but  I  wanted  to  more
clearly  get  my  concerns  in  the  public  record  and  what  I  will  be
doing in coming months and years.

And  with  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my

time.

Mr. PLATTS. Thank you, gentleman.
A  quick  wrap-up,  and  I  apologize.  I  have  got  to  go  to  a  markup,

as well, in another committee.

CULTURAL CHANGE

But two quick issues. One, Ms. Sykes, you talked in your written
statement and part of your testimony here today about the cultural
change reflected by your presence of your Center CFOs here today
with  you  and  the  partnership  with  them  and  them  answering  to
you,  the  fact  that  Mr.  Ciganer  answers  to  the  Administrator,  and
you know, the emphasis on this mission, from a financial—or busi-
ness transformation. But you referenced the CIOs and procurement
aren’t  yet  following  that  approach.  And  to  the  best  of  your  knowl-
edge,  is  there  an  effort  looking  at  using  the  model  with  CFOs  in
the  CIO  community  and  NASA  and  procurement  as  well  to  get  a
more,  you  know,  kind  of  control  at  the  top  to  have  uniformity  and
make sure that they are all on the same page?

Ms. SYKES. Yes, that is one of the areas that the—we have been
discussing internally quite often, and I know the IG has made ref-
erence  to  that  on  occasion,  also,  to  our  Administration.  So  that  is
something that they are deliberating at this point in time. Yes.

Mr. PLATTS. It is not something directly under my subcommittee,
but  it  does  relate  to  our  Subcommittee’s  area  of  jurisdiction  be-
cause  of  the  impact  it  has  on  finance  when  we  are  talking  about
procurement  maybe—especially  or  over  CIO  and  the  investment  of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00100 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

95

important  funds.  And  hopefully  the  example  being  followed  with
CFOs will be followed with CIO and procurement.

So—Mr. Cobb.
Mr. COBB. Congressman Platts, I just would like to mention that
in  connection  with  the  new  Administrator’s  vision  for  how  institu-
tional  management  gets  done  in  the  Agency,  there  has  been  a
change  in  the  sense  that  he  now  expects  the  Center  directors  to
have  responsibility  for  the  institutional  management  at  the  par-
ticular  Centers  but  not  programmatic  responsibility,  other  than
providing the support for the programs in the form of, for example,
engineering  and  that  those  Center  directors  now  report  directly  to
the  Administrator.  So  there  is  a  little  bit  of  a  change  in  terms  of
the  dynamic  and  structure  of  the  top-level  organization  that  could
come to bear in terms of how this question is ultimately answered.

COMPARISONS WITH PAST EFFORTS

Mr.  PLATTS.  Final  question,  actually,  Mr.  Cobb  and  Mr.  Kutz,
and  Mr.  Li,  with  your  history  here  as  well,  earlier  I  asked  to  give
a prognosis. You were hesitant to do so, and I don’t blame you, but
not so much on this specific program and success coming, but in—
being  familiar  with  the  previous  two  efforts  by  NASA  to  try  to  do
this,  how  do  we  shake  out  in  comparison?  My  hope  is,  and  belief
is, that we are a lot further along on the right track than they were
when  they,  you  know,  kind  of  scuttled  the  last  two  efforts.  But  I
would  be  interested,  in  comparison  to  two  previous  attempts,  and
Mr. Cobb, I guess you would have more limited knowledge because
of the timing when you came into your position, but any, you know,
familiarity  you  have  gained  since  you  have  been  there,  and  Mr.
Kutz,  Mr.  Li,  your  assessment  of  where  we  are  in  this  effort  and
huge  commitment  of  manpower,  dollars,  you  name  it,  compared  to
those previous two.

Mr.  LI.  I—let  me  start,  because  I  have  given  it  some  thought  in

terms of—and we have reported on this issue before.

But  the  reasons  why  the  two  previous  efforts  failed,  it  was  an
unclear  linkage  in  terms  of  the  financial  management  system  to
the  mission  itself.  I  think  that  that  was  unclear.  They  were  trying
to  fix  an  accounting  system,  and  now—hopefully,  now  they  have
recognized the fact that it is the basis from which they can do busi-
ness. It was what I considered to be sporadic top management sup-
port.  It  came  at  times  in  which  when  the  contract  had  problems,
the Administrator would get involved, and things would get better.
Then when he disengaged, things got worse again.

And  finally,  I  thought  that  there  was  no  commitment  to  that
transformation that I have mentioned earlier. That transformation
itself was not viewed as something that was important to do as far
as the business change.

What  I  see  in  terms  of  what  they  are  doing,  I  think  that  they
are going to need—to me, the common word that comes through is
persistence.  They  are  going  to  need  to  be  persistent  in  being  able
to  provide  visible  management  support.  And  I  am  not  just  talking
about  funding  support.  I  am  talking  about  the  difficulty  it  is  that
they have right now in terms of change management. That is some-
thing that is very, very difficult to do. They need to keep the pipe-
line open to receive critical skills. They are facing a lot of difficulty

in  terms  of  being  able  to  attract  and  compete  with  other  people,
their  business  and  expertise  area  that  is  very  difficult  to  receive.
And  finally,  again,  keep  moving  on  transformation.  I  think  that  is
something they have to do.

Mr. KUTZ. I mean, I think it is a very important crossroads here,
because  they  have  this—they  are  doing  the  right  thing,  and  they
have  the  right  goals,  and  the  issue  is  is  this  going  to  be  a  system
that  costs  a  lot  that  provides  marginal  improvement,  or  is  this
going to be something that transforms NASA’s business operations.
And  you  know,  history  would  show  that  the  latter  is  much,  much
harder  than  the  former.  And  I  do  think  you  are  going  to  get  some
marginal improvements, but the jury is out as to whether this will
truly be a transformational event at NASA, and that is why we are
all  sitting  here.  That  is  why  you  are  having  this  hearing,  because
we all want it to be that transformational event.

Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Cobb.

MEASURING PROGRESS

Mr.  COBB.  I  would  just  like  to  add  that  we  have  talked  a  little
bit  about  measuring  progress,  and  it  has  been  very  difficult  to  do
in  the  absence  of  a  corrective  action  plan  that  I  view  would  get
them to the goals that all of us would like to see them get to.

Mr. PLATTS. And Ms. Sykes, Mr. Ciganer, I will give you the final
word. Anything you would like to add that we haven’t touched on?
Ms. SYKES. No, sir, and I appreciate your having the opportunity
of having us here today, and just to reiterate that I have committed
to the Committee that we will have a corrective action plan in part-
nership  that  we  will  deliver  that  he  is  agreed  to  and  that  I  have
agreed to.

Mr.  PLATTS.  Well,  we,  again,  appreciate  all  of  your  efforts  day-
in and day-out on these very important issues as well as your time
and preparation and participation here today.

As  I  said  earlier,  we  are  all  on  the  same  team,  after  the  same
ultimate  goals  for  NASA  and  its  mission,  and  hopefully,  working
together,  we  will  achieve  that  goal  in  the  months  and  years  to
come.

We will keep the record open for one week for any of that follow-
up information that is going to be provided, and again, just thanks
for your participation.

This hearing stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:40 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Gwendolyn  Sykes,  Chief  Financial  Officer,  NASA,  and  Mr.  Patrick

Ciganer, Executive Officer, Integrated Financial Management Program, NASA

Questions submitted by Chairman Ken Calvert
Q1. In a recent briefing to the committee, as well as at the hearing, the Office of the
Chief  Financial  Officer  (OCFO)  provided  an  example  of  the  type  of  transaction
that might make up a significant part of the previously unreconciled balance in
NASA’s  Fund  Balance  with  Treasury  (FBWT)  account.  This  explanation  illus-
trated  how  one  transaction  can  result  in  four  times  the  amount  of  the  trans-
action being recorded in NASA’s records. How much of the $7 billion ‘‘gross’’ or
absolute unreconciled difference for FBWT, as identified by the Office of Inspec-
tor  General  in  March,  was  due  to  this  type  of  transaction?  Is  there  documenta-
tion to support this amount? How much of the $7 billion has documented expla-
nations of any type?

A1. In  order  to  balance  its  FY  2003  Financial  Statements  after  the  conversion  of
the 10 NASA Centers to a new Core Financial System, NASA discovered that there
was  a  $1.74  billion  difference  between  the  amounts  recorded  by  the  U.S.  Treasury
Department  as  NASA’s  Fund  Balance  with  Treasury  (FBWT)  and  the  amount  re-
flected  in  its  system.  In  FY  2003  NASA  used  an  external  database  to  produce  its
financial  statements.  Journal  entries  in  the  amount  of  $1.74  billion  were  recorded
in  the  external  database.  As  a  result  of  these  journal  entries,  the  FBWT  amount
reported on NASA’s Financial Statements agreed with the amount reported by U.S.
Treasury.

The $7 billion in question is a by-product of the journal entries that netted to the
$1.74 billion. The $7 billion is the result of adding debits and credits together from
the  journal  entries  that  comprised  the  $1.74  billion  adjustment.  As  an  illustration,
when  a  firm  transfers  $1  million  between  two  bank  accounts,  the  absolute  value  of
those debit and credit transactions totals $4 million; however, the net cash balance
of the firm remains unchanged.

Over  the  past  two  years,  NASA  has  focused  on  identifying  the  detailed  trans-
actions which make up the $1.74 billion difference. NASA has determined that these
transactions have now been substantially recorded in the core financial system.

Finally,  with  respect  to  current  processing,  NASA  has  put  internal  controls  in
place  to  ensure  current  and  future  activity  is  recorded  and  reconciled  on  a  timely
basis.  The  September  2005  FBWT  difference  of  $46.5  million,  or  c  of  one  percent,
is  reconcilable  by  NASA  Centers.  Of  the  $46.5  million  FBWT  difference,  $35.8  mil-
lion is due to September’s increase in the Intergovernmental Suspense Account used
for the Agency Interagency Payment and Collection System (IPACS).
Q2. During  fiscal  year  2005,  NASA  indicated  that  it  was  continuing  to  work  on  re-
solving the remaining unreconciled FBWT transactions from fiscal year 2003. At
the  hearing,  NASA’s  Chief  Financial  Officer  indicated  that  the  FBWT  account
was almost reconciled except for $36 million in intragovernmental transfers and
$10  million  in  other  differences.  For  the  FBWT  transactions  from  fiscal  year
2003, please provide a list of the amounts that each NASA Center reconciled and
the  amounts  that  each  Center  wrote  off  (or  ‘‘wrote  up’’)  during  fiscal  year  2005.
Please  note  that  we  would  like  these  amounts  for  each  Center  rather  than  the
net amounts for the Agency as a whole.

A2. Write off transactions were processed Agency-wide as follows:

99

In total, NASA’s cash balance was less than Treasury’s, which resulted in an over-

all write up.
Q3. NASA is planning a major software upgrade for the Core Financial module this
year.  What  specific  problems  with  the  current  version  of  Core  Financial  do  you
expect to remedy with the upgrade?

A3. The SAP Version Update (SVU) project will address several issues and require-
ments for improvement identified by NASA and the Government Accountability Of-
fice  (GAO),  as  identified  in  their  report  GAO–04–151  (BUSINESS  MODERNIZA-
TION:  NASA’s  Integrated  Financial  Management  Program  Does  Not  Fully  Address
Agency’s  External  Reporting  Issues).  The  update  will  contribute  to  improvements  in
NASA’s  financial  tracking  and  reporting,  support  the  goal  of  achieving  financial
management  integrity,  and  expand  core  financial  functionality  to  provide  better
project management information. The update will improve NASA’s compliance with
Federal Financial Management System Requirements (FFMSR), Federal Accounting
Standards  (FAS),  and  the  Federal  Financial  Management  Improvement  Act
(FFMIA).

Specifically,  the  SVU  will  provide  enhanced  capabilities  and  better  integration
with the new Budgetary Ledger. This will provide greater integrity in NASA’s State-
ment  of  Budgetary  Resources,  Standard  General  Ledger  account  relationships,  and
Statement of Transactions report to Treasury.

Improved support for the Budget Distribution process will be achieved from proc-
ess re-engineering activities and additional software capabilities from the new Budg-
et  Control  System.  The  Internal  Operating  Plan  can  be  recorded  in  SAP  providing
increased  budget  planning  capability  for  the  year  of  execution  and  the  potential
elimination of duplicate data entry and reconciliation activities. Additional software
capabilities  include  less  reliance  on  user  selections  during  postings  resulting  in
greater data integrity; improved support and flexibility in execution against the new
budget structures; and automated routing and approval of budgetary documents.

The updated version provides additional automation of existing business processes
resulting  in  reductions  in  current  manual  processes,  reconciliations,  and  workload.
Specific  areas  where  problems  are  addressed,  or  existing  ‘gaps’  in  the  current
version are filled, include:

• The  ability  to  control  the  timing  of  the  commitment  and  obligation  posting
through  work  flow  configuration  options—eliminates  current  manual  control
and  reconciliation  processes.  This  fully  resolves  one  of  the  GAO’s  issues  re-
lated to FFMIA compliance.
• Additional  automation  of  adjustment  accounting  entries—reduces  manual
processes  and  reconciliations.  This  addresses  one  of  the  GAO’s  concerns  re-
lated to FFMIA compliance.
• The  ability  to  track  returned  invoices—eliminates  the  manual  tracking  proc-
• The  streamlined  year-end  closing  process  provides  greater  automation,  less
manual effort and resource requirements and shortens the cycle time to com-
plete closing.

ess in the current version.

Additionally, NASA has taken steps to address the issues related to cost in excess
of  obligations  and  downward  adjustments,  another  issue  identified  by  the  GAO  re-
lated  to  non-compliance  with  Federal  Accounting  Standards.  Process  improvements
in this area will be implemented as part of the SAP Version Update.
Q4. How  will  the  migration  of  certain  functions  to  NASA’s  Shared  Services  Center
affect the operations of the Core Financial module? In light of the new integrated
financial system, why is a Shared Services Center necessary? What benefits does
NASA expect to gain from this Center?

A4. The decision to implement a shared services model for a broad spectrum of ad-
ministrative functions was made several years ago. Finance is one component of the
NASA  Shared  Services  Center  (NSSC).  Other  components  include  Human  Capital,
Procurement,  and  Information  Technology  areas.  The  NSSC  does  not  currently  af-
fect the Integrated Enterprise Management Program (IEMP) Core Financial module
operations.  Representatives  from  the  NSSC  and  IEMP  are  working  closely  to  iden-
tify  any  configuration  changes  required  to  the  Core  Financial  module.  The  more
challenging and complex transition will be of accounts payable and accounts receiv-
able processing which is scheduled for FY 2008.

As NASA improves its financial systems and strengthens its internal financial op-
erations,  we  will  monitor  the  transfer  of  financial  operations  to  the  shared  services
center to optimally balance the benefits and the associated risks.

IEMP provided a platform for transactional activities in financial management to
be  performed  using  a  consolidated  shared  service  delivery  model.  NASA  hopes  to
benefit  from  a  shared  services  center  that  supports  a  more  judicious  distribution  of
discretionary funding to mission core competencies.
Q5. In their report on internal control for fiscal year 2004, NASA’s external auditors
indicated that NASA had not fully complied with the Improper Payments Infor-
mation  Act.  What  steps  has  NASA  taken  to  improve  its  estimates  of  improper
payments in accordance with this Act?

A5. Subsequent to receipt of its FY 2004 audit report, NASA improved its Improper
Payments  Information  Act  (IPIA)  procedures  by  entering  into  a  multi-year  contract
with  a  recovery  audit  firm.  The  scope  of  work  for  the  contract  includes  conducting
audit  recovery  procedures  on  all  contract  and  vendor  payments;  recovering  pay-
ments  that  were  made  improperly;  and  providing  reports  that  will  help  NASA  im-
prove internal controls regarding the payment process. The contract stipulates that
the firm will be paid based on a percentage of improper payments that they identify
and  recover.  In  2006,  NASA  will  continue  to  strengthen  its  procedures  for  moni-
toring improper payments.
Q6. Ms.  Sykes’  testimony  indicated  that  NASA  has  a  new  capitalization  policy  for
its assets, and is developing procedures to implement that policy. Please provide
a  copy  of  that  policy  and  a  brief  description  of  how  the  policy  will  be  imple-
mented.

A6. Prior  to  full  implementation  of  NASA’s  revised  capitalization  policy  for  its  as-
sets,  OCFO  management  plans  to  meet  with  OMB,  GAO,  FASAB,  and  OIG  to  dis-
cuss  NASA’s  revised  capitalization  policy  and  to  explain  the  effect  of  the  changes
on  the  assets  currently  being  reported.  The  revised  capitalization  policy  will  be  fi-
nalized following these discussions. The policy can be provided upon finalization.
Q7. The  NASA  Financial  Audit  Committee  established  under  the  previous  NASA
Advisory Council met several times during the past year, spending much of that
time  learning  about  NASA’s  financial  and  accounting  operations.  That  com-
mittee  was  recently  decommissioned.  Under  the  new  NASA  Advisory  Council,  a
new  Audit  and  Finance  Committee  has  been  designated  with  all  new  members.
How  will  this  new  committee  leverage  the  knowledge  developed  by  the  previous
committee  so  that  it  can  build  upon  that  knowledge  rather  than  beginning  the
learning  process  all  over  again?  For  example  has  the  new  committee  been  pro-
vided minutes of the previous committee’s meetings? Are there any plans for the
new  committee  to  meet  with  the  Chairman  or  other  members  of  the  prior  com-
mittee?

A7. The  new  Audit  &  Finance  Committee  is  populated  with  members  possessing
tremendous expertise in both public and private sector financial management: Hon.
Ted McPherson (former CFO, Dept. of Agriculture; Deputy Secretary, Dept. of Edu-
cation); Hon. Michael Montelongo (former CFO, U.S. Air Force; Member, Audit Com-
mittee,  Denny’s);  Robert  Hanisee  (Managing  Director,  Trust  Company  of  the  West;
Member, Audit Committee, Orbital Sciences); Harold Stanislawski (attorney, Sidley
Austin Wood) has been at the forefront of his firm’s practice in the areas of Govern-
ment contract cost accounting issues.

OCFO staff support has been provided to both committees by the same Executive
Secretary, who has retained all records from the prior committee. Copies of minutes
and  presentations  delivered  to  the  previous  committee  are  readily  available  for  use
by the current committee. The continuity of the Executive Secretary will assure that
precious  time  and  resources  are  not  spent  deliberating  issues  covered  by  the  pre-
vious  committee  and  available  in  the  records.  The  new  committee  Chairman  is
aware  of  these  records  and  their  availability  upon  his  request.  The  Executive  Sec-
retary has provided contact information for prior committee members to the current
Chairman for use as he deems appropriate.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. What  do  you  see  as  the  biggest  challenge  in  improving  NASA’s  financial  man-

agement situation?
• Which material weakness is the most challenging for NASA to correct?
• What specific actions have you taken to correct it?

A1.

• NASA’s  FY  2005  Report  on  Internal  Controls  identified  material  weaknesses
for Financial Systems, Analyses, and Oversight; Fund Balance with Treasury;
and  Controls  over  Property,  Plant,  and  Equipment  and  Materials;  as  well  as
a  reportable  condition  for  Controls  in  Estimating  NASA’s  Environmental  Li-
abilities.  We  intend  to  treat  each  of  these  areas  of  equal  importance  in  im-
proving financial management at NASA. To characterize any one area as the
most  challenging  could  detract  from  the  appropriate  focus  and  attention
across all improvement areas.

• In  my  October  testimony,  I  highlighted  areas  of  improvement  made  through
FY 2005. In FY 2006, we are continuing to execute and strengthen our correc-
tive action plans to address these audit findings.

Q2. GAO’s testimony describes in some detail the difficulty GAO had in trying to ob-
tain  information  on  travel  costs  during  its  recent  review  of  aircraft  utilization
at  NASA.  Mr.  Kutz  points  out  that  this  raises  a  question  of  the  accuracy  of
NASA’s ‘‘full-cost’’ accounting, if these travel costs are not being captured to the
relevant  accounts.  Yet  the  Travel  Manager  system,  an  IFMP  element,  has  been
in place since May 2003. Why is NASA still having such difficulty tracking and
reporting travel costs?

A2. Mr.  Kutz’s  comments  with  respect  to  NASA  aircraft  utilization  refer  to  the
fixed,  variable  and  other  costs  of  aircraft  ownership  and  operation.  OMB  Circular
A–126  requires  that  such  aircraft  utilization  costs  be  captured  and  visible  in  an
automated agency system. NASA is currently working to identify the policies, proce-
dures and system changes necessary to fully comply with the Circular.

NASA’s  Travel  Manager  system  is  a  fully  automated  capability  that  creates  and
routes  travel  authorizations  (request  to  travel)  and  vouchers  (request  travel  ex-
penses)  of  individual  travelers.  Travel  Manager  is  integrated  with  NASA’s  core  fi-
nancial  system,  where  traveler  costs  are  captured  and  reportable  utilizing  NASA’s
Business Warehouse tool.
Q3. NASA is planning to do a major upgrade of the core financial module next year.
• Will  that  upgrade  address  the  problems  described  by  the  Inspector  General

and GAO?

• Is  NASA’s  process  for  integrating  the  upgrade  into  the  existing  system  struc-
tured to avoid the kinds of problems that accompanied the rollout of the origi-
nal core financial module?

A3.

• The  core  financial  system  upgrade,  the  SAP  Version  Update  (SVU)  project,
will address several issues and needs for improvement identified by the Office
of  Inspector  General  (OIG)  and  the  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO).
The update will contribute to improvements in NASA’s financial tracking and
reporting,  support  the  goal  of  achieving  financial  management  integrity,  and
expand  core  financial  functionality  to  provide  better  project  management  in-
formation.  The  update  will  improve  NASA’s  compliance  with  Federal  Finan-
cial Management System Requirements (FFMSR), Federal Accounting Stand-
ards  (FAS),  and  the  Federal  Financial  Management  Improvement  Act
(FFMIA).
Specifically,  the  SVU  will  provide  enhanced  capabilities  and  better  integra-
tion  with  the  new  Budgetary  Ledger.  This  will  provide  greater  integrity  in
NASA’s Statement of Budgetary Resources, Standard General Ledger account
relationships, and Statement of Transactions report to Treasury.
Improved  support  for  the  Budget  Distribution  process  will  be  achieved  from
process re-engineering activities and additional software capabilities from the
new Budget Control System. The Internal Operating Plan can be recorded in
SAP providing increased budget planning capability for the year of execution
and the potential elimination of duplicate data entry and reconciliation activi-
ties.  Additional  software  capabilities  include  less  reliance  on  user  selections
during  postings  resulting  in  greater  data  integrity;  improved  support  and
flexibility  in  execution  against  the  new  budget  structures;  and  automated
routing and approval of budgetary documents.
The updated version provides additional automation of existing business proc-
esses resulting in reductions in current manual processes, reconciliations and
workload.  Specific  areas  where  problems  are  addressed,  or  existing  ‘gaps’  in
the current version are filled, include:

• The  ability  to  control  the  timing  of  the  commitment  and  obligation  post-
ing  through  work  flow  configuration  options—eliminates  current  manual
control  and  reconciliation  processes.  This  fully  resolves  one  of  the  GAO’s
issues related to FFMIA compliance.
• Additional automation of adjustment accounting entries—reduces manual
processes  and  reconciliations.  This  addresses  one  of  the  GAO’s  concerns
related to FFMIA compliance.
• The  ability  to  track  returned  invoices—eliminates  the  manual  tracking
• The  streamlined  year-end  closing  process  provides  greater  automation,
less manual effort and resource requirements and shortens the cycle time
to complete closing.

process in the current version.

Additionally,  NASA  has  taken  steps  to  address  the  issues  related  to  cost  in
excess  of  obligations  and  downward  adjustments,  another  issue  identified  by
the GAO related to non-compliance with Federal Accounting Standards. Proc-
ess  improvements  in  this  area  will  be  implemented  as  part  of  the  SAP
Version Update.
• For the core financial system upgrade, the SAP Version Update (SVU) project,
NASA does not expect to experience the magnitude of problems that were ex-
perienced  during  the  rollout  of  the  original  core  financial  module.  However,
NASA recognizes that a large software version upgrade such as this is a sig-
nificant challenge. There are major architectural differences between the cur-
rent  version  of  SAP  and  the  newer  version  that  NASA  plans  to  implement.
NASA  has  put  in  place  very  thorough  requirement  management  and  testing
processes  which  will  be  critical  to  the  success  of  the  upgrade.  Also,  as  noted
above,  there  are  a  large  number  of  new  capabilities  and  improvements  that
are  inherent  in  the  upgrade,  which  will  necessitate  rigorous  training.  NASA
has established a project team focused on the upgrade, with sub-teams estab-
lished  for  technical  integration,  functional  process  integration,  change  man-
agement,  data  management,  application  development,  and  quality  assurance.
The  core  team,  at  full  strength,  will  consist  of  16  civil  servants  and  over  80
contractors.  This  team  will  follow  proven  and  successful  approaches  to  re-
quirements  management,  design,  testing,  risk  management,  change  manage-
ment,  and  other  disciplines  required  to  successfully  implement  the  financial
upgrade.

Q4. The  IEMP  modules  implemented  at  this  point—resume  management,  position
descriptions, calculating and allocating labor costs, travel—don’t appear central
to the main problems NASA has in financial management.
• Is  the  prioritization  of  effort  correct?  Are  the  core  financial  module  problems
• You’ve recently deferred the asset management module, and the contract man-
agement  module  doesn’t  seem  to  do  much  more  than  sort  Federal  Acquisition
Regulation clauses for contracting officers.

getting the bulk of your attention and resources at this time?

Could  you  please  provide  the  Committee  with  an  analysis  demonstrating  how
your staff’s time and resources are being used on these projects?

A4.

• When  the  IEMP  program  was  formulated  in  FY  2000,  its  first  priority  was
to implement a single financial system for NASA. This was completed in June
2003. During this same time frame, smaller projects such as resume manage-
ment,  position  description,  and  travel  manager,  were  implemented  while  the
financial  system  was  still  in  development.  These  smaller  projects,  or  ‘‘path-
finders,’’ represented an opportunity to gain experience in Agency-wide imple-
mentations,  filled  important  functional  needs  in  other  non-financial  areas,
and  helped  build  momentum  for  the  larger  core  financial  effort.  As  noted  by
the GAO, NASA, and others, the initial core financial system needed improve-
ment  in  several  areas.  Ongoing  improvements  have  been  made  since  the  ini-
tial  implementation.  Since  2003,  bi-annual  configuration  changes  have  been
made  to  the  current  version  of  the  software,  which  have  resulted  in  various
process  and  data  integrity  improvements.  However,  larger  changes  were  im-
plemented  during  FY  2005,  and  became  currently  operational  at  the  begin-
ning of this fiscal year (2006). Specifically, the Project Management Informa-
tion  Improvement  (PMII)  initiative  implemented  a  new  coding  structure
which  improves  how  NASA  manages  project  information  by  aligning  the
Agency’s many technical and financial work breakdown structures into a sin-

gle  data  management  structure.  The  Agency  Labor  Distribution  System
(ALDS) project extended the Core Financial system such that NASA now has
a  single  capability—versus  10  Center-specific  legacy  systems—for  allocating
labor  costs,  significantly  improving  consistency  of  cost  calculations  and  im-
proving  NASA’s  overall  full  cost  management.  IEMP  is  currently  focused  on
a  major  update  of  the  financial  system.  This  effort,  by  far,  is  IEMP’s  largest
project underway this fiscal year, both in terms of budget and personnel.
• Currently, NASA has five civil servants and two contractors focused on anal-
ysis  of  future  asset  management  capabilities.  They  are  performing  market
analysis and benchmarking with federal and private sector organizations, and
are  developing  a  business  case  describing  various  alternatives,  including  the
costs, risks, and benefits of each alternative. The business case and associated
recommendations  will  be  presented  in  the  spring  of  2006  to  NASA  executive
management for their review and decision.
Currently,  NASA  has  six  civil  servants  and  43  contractors  working  on  the
Contract Management Module (CMM) project. Prior to now, they had been fo-
cused  on  requirements  development,  design  and  configuration,  unit  testing,
project  management,  and  overall  planning  and  communications  on  the
project.  Presently,  they  are  conducting  system  and  integration  testing.  The
CMM module, which will become operational in May 2006, will do much more
than  sort  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  (FAR)  clauses  for  contracting  offi-
cers. Specifically, it provides major functionality in four areas:

1. Contract  Writing  System:  Provides  electronic  document  generation  and
transmission  system  capable  of  seamlessly  interfacing/integrating  with
the Agency’s IEM Core Financial System.

2. Procurement  Workload  Management:  Provides  workload  tracking  capa-
bility  to  sufficiently  supply  metric  and  status  data  to  Procurement  per-
sonnel, managers, customers, and stakeholders.

3. Data Management: Meets Federal requirements for reports by efficiently
providing accurate data to General Services Administration’s (GSA) Fed-
eral  Procurement  Data  System  (FPDS)  and  NSF’s  Federal  Assistance
Awards  Data  System,  along  with  reports  to  the  Department  of  Labor
(DOL) and Small Business Administration (SBA).

4. Contract  Administration:  Supports  more  effective  contract  management
by  providing  automated  capabilities  to  expedite  and  assist  the  contract
professional in administering contracts.

Q5. Have you issued a financial management corrective action plan?

• When do you plan on completing a corrective action plan?
• What specific steps have you taken/are you taking to identify the needs of the
Mission  Directorates  and  Support  Offices  and  to  incorporate  those  needs  into
the corrective action plan?
• What specific steps have you taken/are you taking to ensure that the corrective

action plan will be approved by the Administrator?

to work closely with the NASA Center Directors in supporting their respective Cen-
ter’s financial management requirements. The change in reporting has increased the
Center  CFO’s  accountability  for  the  overall  Agency’s  financial  management  condi-
tion.  Center  CFOs  are  aware  of  this  increased  accountability  as  they  are  now  re-
quired  to  sign  monthly  certifications  attesting  to  the  condition  of  their  financial
records.

Center CFOs played a key role in developing the financial management corrective
action plan. The Center CFOs provided input to a root cause analysis which directly
contributed to the draft corrective action plans.

Center CFOs receive feedback regarding their Center’s financial reporting through
several venues. Biweekly video teleconferences are held to discuss financial manage-
ment  issues  with  the  Agency  CFO,  Center  CFOs,  and  headquarters  staff.  In  addi-
tion,  the  Agency  CFO  and  Center  CFOs  meet  in  person  at  least  quarterly.  These
meetings provide an opportunity for the Agency CFO to discuss overall strategic di-
rection,  review  Agency  financial  management  priorities,  and  provide  detailed  direc-
tion to the Center CFOs.

Responses by Robert W. Cobb, Inspector General, NASA

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Ken Calvert
Q1. Please provide what you believe are the top three or four financial management-
related  issues  that  NASA  needs  to  address,  and  what  progress  NASA  needs  to
make on these issues in the next 12 months.

A1. During  the  next  12  months,  the  Agency  should  focus  on  addressing  two  impor-
tant  issues:  (1)  demonstrating  that  current  processes  are  working  as  intended,  and
(2)  demonstrating  that  it  is  making  progress  in  addressing  and  resolving  the  exist-
ing  material  weaknesses  and  reportable  conditions  in  its  internal  controls.  While  it
is  unlikely  that  NASA  will  be  able  to  remediate  all  of  its  deficiencies  over  the  next
12  months,  the  ability  to  show  that  it  is  making  progress  in  addressing  its  defi-
ciencies will be an important step in the right direction.

To  demonstrate  that  current  processes  are  working  as  intended,  the  Agency  will
need  to  ensure  that  all  accounting  policies  and  procedures  comply  with  applicable
requirements  and  all  users  and  system  components  are  processing  current  year
transactions in accordance with those policies and procedures. If the Agency can do
this  it  will  enable  the  independent  public  accountant  (IPA)  to  begin  the  process  of
assessing whether the processes are working as intended and providing financial in-
formation that is accurate and reliable. Given the accelerated year-end reporting re-
quirements, revised policies and procedures should be established and implemented
as early as possible in the fiscal year so the independent public accountant can test
them  because  later  implementations  present  a  testing  challenge  for  that  year’s  fi-
nancial statement audit.

In order to demonstrate progress in addressing and resolving internal control defi-
ciencies,  the  Agency  will  need  to  develop  and  implement  a  corrective  action  plan
that articulates a strategy for addressing the underlying problems. Some of the ma-
terial weaknesses/reportable conditions should be easier to address than others. For
example,  resolving  the  weaknesses  in  NASA’s  internal  controls  for  estimating  envi-
ronmental  liability  should  require  less  effort  and  time  than  those  for  property,
plant, and equipment (PP&E), which will require a coordinated long-term effort. The
goal  should  be  to  remediate  the  deficiency  where  possible  and  to  show  progress  in
addressing these areas where it will take time to develop and implement a remedy.
The  material  weaknesses  and  reportable  conditions  (identified  by  these  that
should  be  the  easiest  to  address  to  the  most  difficult)  and  the  progress  that  NASA
should make during the next 12 months are:
Estimates of NASA’s Environmental Liability

In both the FY 2004 and FY 2005 audit reports, the IPA found a reportable weak-
ness  in  NASA’s  ability  to  generate  auditable  estimates  of  its  unfunded  environ-
mental liabilities (UEL), which totaled $825 million as of September 30, 2005. This
deficiency is one that the Agency should be able to resolve over the next 12 months.
To do so, the Agency will need to complete the following actions:

• Revising its action plan developed in response to the FY 2004 audit.
• Expediting the timeline for completion of the final UEL estimates.
• Executing the corrective actions, including ensuring that NASA personnel re-

ceive sufficient training on how to prepare auditable estimates.

• Perforining a self-assessment of the estimation and aggregation process to en-

sure all weaknesses are identified and corrected.

• Validating  and  accrediting  the  Integrated  Data  Evaluation  and  Analysis  Li-

brary model and methodology used to prepare UEL estimates.

Fund Balance With Treasury Differences

The  IPA  reported  Fund  Balance  with  Treasury  as  a  material  weakness  for  the
past three years. Significant differences existed between the Treasury’s and NASA’s
fund  balances.  Treasury  regulations  require  that  each  federal  entity  ensure  that  it
reconciles  its  financial  records  with  Treasury’s  records  on  a  monthly  basis,  and
promptly resolve differences. The Agency may be able to resolve this deficiency over
the next 12 months if it can successfully accomplish the following actions:

• Improving current procedures so that reconciliations are timely and in accord-
ance  with  policy;  differences  are  thoroughly  researched,  timely  resolved,  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00111 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

106

reviewed by Center and headquarters OCFO management; and the audit trail
is sufficiently documented.

• Ensuring  that  the  reasons  for  historical  imbalances  have  been  identified  and
corrected  and  there  is  an  audit  trail  for  verification  by  management  and  the
independent public accountant.

• Revising policies for reconciling differences in the fund balance to ensure com-

pliance with applicable requirements.

Financial Systems, Analyses, and Oversight

The  IPA  reported  financial  systems,  analyses,  and  oversight  as  a  material  weak-
ness  for  the  past  four  years.  During  FY  2004  and  FY  2005,  NASA’s  management
continued  to  identify  and  work  toward  resolving  its  major  system  conversion,  con-
figuration,  and  data  integrity  issues.  Many  of  the  deficiencies  in  this  area  are  com-
plex  and  longstanding,  and  resolving  all  of  them  may  take  several  years.  However,
the Agency can demonstrate progress in the next 12 months by taking the following
actions:

• Developing a plan to bring the financial management system into compliance
with  the  Federal  Financial  Management  Improvement  Act  of  1996  (FFMIA).
• Identifying  and  resolving  data  errors  in  Systems,  Applications,  and  Products
(SAP)  resulting  from  data  conversion,  and  support  the  resolution  of  data  er-
rors by sufficiently documenting how the errors were identified and corrected.
• Maintaining  sufficient  documentation  to  serve  as  an  audit  trail  for  both  rou-
tine  and  non-routine  adjustments  to  transactions  and  balances  in  SAP.  The
FY 2006 quarterly financial statements must not only be generated from SAP,
but any adjustments made to reported amounts, whether made within or out-
side of SAP, need to be fully substantiated by adequate documentation.

• Completing  configuration  in  SAP  to  accommodate,  to  the  extent  possible,  ac-
counting  and  reporting  requirements  for  NASA’s  business  processes.  For  ex-
ample,  NASA  must  configure  SAP  to  identify  corrections  to  prior-year  trans-
actions as adjustments rather than as current-year transactions.

• Establishing a periodic monitoring mechanism to run queries in SAP to iden-
tify  inconsistencies  such  as  abnormal  balances  in  accounts  and  abnormal  ac-
count  relationship  issues.  This  would  also  help  NASA  discover  errors  in  ac-
count balances well before quarterly financial statements are prepared.

• Improving  the  process  of  financial  statement  preparation  and  analysis  with
a  goal  of  complying  with  all  applicable  requirements  (e.g.,  producing  a  state-
ment of net cost that meets requirements).

• Ensuring  that  accounting  policies  and  procedures  comply  with  applicable  re-
quirements and that all users and system components are processing current-
year transactions in accordance with those policies and procedures. Given the
accelerated  year-end  reporting  requirements,  revised  policies  and  procedures
should be established and implemented as early as possible in the fiscal year
so the independent public accountant can test them. Implementations late in
the  fiscal  year  present  a  testing  challenge  for  that  year’s  financial  statement
audit.

Property, Plant, and Equipment Management

The  IPA  reported  repeated  material  weaknesses  in  NASA’s  internal  control  over
property,  plant,  and  equipment  (PP&E).  If  not  corrected,  these  weaknesses  could
prevent material misstatements from being detected and corrected in a timely man-
ner.  The  total  worth  of  NASA’s  PP&E  is  approximately  $34.9  billion,  or  75  percent
of  NASA’s  reported  assets.  The  most  serious  internal  control  weaknesses  in  this
area relate to contractor-held property reporting and NASA’s property capitalization
policies and procedures. Solving this complex deficiency will take time, so a reason-
able goal for the Agency is to demonstrate progress in the next 12 months by devel-
oping a coordinated comprehensive plan that provides for:

• Resolving prior year audit recommendations;
• Revisiting its approach to capitalizing property to include establishing and in-
stituting  a  comprehensive  and  consistent  property  capitalization  policy.  Such
a  policy  would  also  include  establishing  a  system  to  help  NASA  accumulate
and record the cost of capitalized property as it is acquired.
• Vetting  its  draft  policy  on  capitalization  for  theme  assets  with  the  financial

oversight community and making revisions to the policy as necessary.

107

• Requiring  that  supervisory  approval  of  data  is  provided  by  someone  other
than the individual who is entering values of contractor-held property into the
Contractor Held Asset Tracking System (CHATS).
• Ensuring  that  internal  controls  over  property  specify  that  adequate  informa-
tion on all expenditures made by NASA, including its contractor activities, is
available for scrutiny as necessary.
• Requiring  contractors  to  report  property  subsidiary  details  to  support  prop-
erty  values  reported  in  CHATS.  This  detailed  subsidiary  report  should  in-
clude a list of individual property items and values.
• Reconciling  property  values  reported  on  NASA  Form  533s  (used  to  report
project costs as incurred) with the related amounts reported in CHATS. This
reconciliation  should  be  included  as  part  the  NASA  property  accountants’
periodic contractor-held property validation process.
• Ensuring  that  the  Inspector  General  and  IPA  confirm  the  coordinated  com-
prehensive  plan,  if  executed,  will  meet  all  management  and  audit  require-
ments.

Q2. What  do  you  believe  is  the  earliest  year  that  NASA  might  be  able  to  receive  a

clean audit opinion?

A2. It is difficult to project when NASA might be able to receive a clean audit opin-
ion.  Given  the  complexity  and  longstanding  nature  of  the  Agency’s  internal  control
deficiencies, with sustained focus on correcting the root causes of the material weak-
nesses,  it  will  still  likely  take  a  few  years  for  the  Agency  to  be  able  to  prepare
auditable  financial  statements.  In  order  for  NASA  to  address  its  financial  manage-
ment  problems,  it  will  need  to  articulate  a  strategy  that  addresses  both  the  prob-
lems  and  the  actions  required  to  resolve  those  problems,  including  the  personnel
and  other  resources  needed  to  fix  the  problems.  Once  a  corrective  action  plan  has
been  developed,  approved,  and  implemented,  and  the  Agency  can  represent  that  it
is  producing  auditable  financial  statements,  the  IPA  will  then  be  in  a  position  to
conduct the detailed testing required to render an opinion.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. What  do  you  see  as  the  biggest  challenge  in  improving  NASA’s  financial  man-

agement situation?

A1. NASA’s  biggest  challenge  is  to  implement  a  fully  automated  integrated  finan-
cial  management  system  that  provides  program  managers  and  other  key  stake-
holders  and  decision-makers—including  the  Congress—with  reliable  financial  infor-
mation  needed  to  measure  program  performance,  estimate  future  costs,  and  ensure
accountability.

Until NASA has a fully operational and integrated financial management system,
it  will  not  be  able  to  address  its  longstanding  financial  management  practice  and
business process issues. The Integrated Enterprise Management Program (IEMP) in
its  current  state  does  not  routinely  provide  reliable  financial  information.  As  a  re-
sult,  program  managers  and  cost  estimators  continue  to  use  systems  outside  of
IEMP  and  other  labor-intensive  means  to  capture  the  data  they  need  to  manage
their programs.
Q2. Which material weakness is the most challenging for NASA to correct?
A2. Instituting  adequate  internal  control  over  PP&E  is  NASA’s  greatest  material
weakness  challenge.  PP&E  represents  75  percent  of  NASA’s  reported  assets.  The
two  categories  of  PP&E  most  difficult  to  correct  are  controls  over  contractor-held
property and theme assets. Contractor-held property presents the greater of the two
challenges  because  it  is  not  controlled  by  NASA  employees  and  is  not  located  in
NASA  facilities,  thus  meeting  this  challenge  requires  an  internal  control  plan  that
provides the Agency a basis for independently ensuring the reliability and accuracy
of  contractor-reported  property  values.  Theme  assets,  those  things  that  the  Agency
launches into space, present a unique challenge in developing a capitalization policy
that conforms to generally accepted accounting principles and results in the report-
ing of meaningful values on NASA’s financial statements.
Q3. NASA is planning to do a major upgrade of the core financial module next year.
Will that upgrade address the problems described by the Inspector General and
the Government Accountability Office (GAO)?

A3. It  is  too  early  to  tell  given  that  the  Agency  just  initiated  the  SAP  Version  Up-
date (SVU) in September 2005. However, according to the IEMP Program Office, the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:03 May 20, 2006 Jkt 024134 PO 00000 Frm 00113 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\102705\24134 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

SVU  is  intended  to  deliver  enhanced  functionality  to  the  existing  Core  Financial
module, including:

108

• improved data integrity based on SAP Funds Management redesign,
• improved processes for reducing errors and mispostings,
• additional automation of adjustment accounting entries,
• improvements to the budget distribution process,
• analysis  and  potential  redesign  of  lower  level  funds  control  and  funds  dis-

tribution,

• addressing  program/project  management  needs  by  modifying  business  proc-
esses and systems architecture to unbundle management reporting from gen-
eral ledger accounting through analytical staff and data warehouse configura-
tion, and

• streamlined  year-end  processing  starting  with  FY  2007  year-end  processing.
Collectively,  these  improvements,  if  realized  through  the  SVU,  should  contribute
to  improving  NASA’s  financial  tracking  and  reporting.  However,  to  ensure  that  the
SVU  project  is  successful,  an  effective  project  governance  structure  and  process
must be established that will integrate and prioritize the diverse requirements that
will be levied on the project through the active participation and commitment of key
stakeholders.  We  have  initiated  a  review  to  determine  whether  NASA  has  estab-
lished an effective project governance structure and process to manage the SVU.
Q4. Is NASA’s process for integrating the upgrade into the existing system structured
to avoid the kinds of problems that accompanied the rollout of the original core
financial module?

A4. We recently initiated an audit of NASA’s project governance structure and proc-
ess  to  manage  the  upgrade  effort.  We  intend  to  focus  that  audit  on  determining
whether NASA is taking action to avoid problems encountered with the deployment
of the Core Financial module. Specifically, we will determine whether NASA has (1)
ensured  there  is  adequate  leadership  and  direction  to  coordinate,  evaluate,  and
monitor the upgrade; (2) resolved data integrity issues and initiated end-to-end busi-
ness  process  re-engineering  before  upgrading  the  core  financial  module;  and  (3)  fo-
cused  training  on  user  needs—all  actions  NASA  did  not  take  during  the  initial  im-
plementation  of  the  core  financial  module.  Given  that  we  only  recently  begun  the
audit, we do not yet have any findings to disclose.
Q5. In  your  opinion,  why  has  NASA  been  unable  to  outline  either  a  clear  strategy
for  resolving  the  weaknesses  or  develop  a  corrective  action  plan  over  the  past
three and a half years?

A5. Over the past three and a half years, the Agency has attempted to develop sev-
eral  corrective  action  plans  to  correct  the  identified  weaknesses,  but  those  plans
have  not  outlined  a  clear  strategy  for  resolving  those  weaknesses,  nor  have  they
been put into final form. NASA senior management continues to provide only high-
level,  broadly  worded  proposed  initiatives  that  lack  sufficient  detail  and  strategies
to address the outstanding deficiencies. Moreover, the Agency has not embraced the
idea that an effective corrective action plan should be the product of NASA program
and  institutional  leadership,  within  parameters  set  by  financial  management  and
accounting laws and regulations.
Q6. What do you think it will take for NASA to do so?
A6. My  office,  along,  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  (OCFO),  is  engaged
in  a  conversation  with  the  NASA  leadership  for  identifying  the  best  path  forward.
However,  for  a  corrective  action  plan  to  come  to  fruition,  the  collaboration  of  many
organizations within NASA including the OCFO, Center CFOs, institutional leader-
ship,  the  Integrated  Enterprise  Management  Program  Office,  mission  program  of-
fices,  and  infrastructure  and  administrative  offices  both  at  Headquarters  and  at
NASA  Centers  is  required.  A  necessary  prerequisite  for  a  successful  corrective  ac-
tion  plan  is  cross-organizational  collaboration  and  coordination,  especially  as  finan-
cial management is an issue that cuts across these many organizations. As each or-
ganization  within  NASA  has  its  own  mission,  interests,  and  operational  require-
ments, involvement by each of these organizations is necessary in both the formula-
tion and implementation stages of the plan.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Gregory  D.  Kutz,  Managing  Director,  Forensic  Audits  and  Special  In-

vestigations, GAO

Question submitted by Chairman Ken Calvert
Q1. What are the top three to four financial management issues NASA needs to ad-
dress  and  the  progress  the  Agency  should  make  in  addressing  these  issues  over
the next 12 months?

A1. Because  NASA  did  not  adopt  disciplined  acquisition  and  implementation  prac-
tices  as  part  of  its  Integrated  Enterprise  Management  Program  (IEMP)  effort,  it
must now take actions that should have been accomplished prior to implementation
in order to produce a system that meets user needs. To minimize the impact of past
mistakes  and  begin  to  reap  the  benefits  of  operating  with  an  integrated  financial
management  system  sooner,  we  believe  that  NASA  should  expeditiously  implement
each  of  the  IEMP  recommendations  we  made  in  fiscal  year  2003.  However,  there
are three issues that should take priority and be addressed immediately.

First,  to  stabilize  and  improve  the  functionality  of  IEMP,  we  continue  to  believe
that  NASA  needs  a  detailed,  comprehensive  financial  management  improvement
plan. Such a plan should include the specific improvement activities required to ad-
dress  deficiencies  in  NASA’s  systems,  processes,  and  human  capital  that  we  and
other auditors have identified; dates for completion; how progress will be measured;
and clear accountability for each action not completed in a timely and effective man-
ner.  Further,  the  plan  should  be  developed  in  coordination  with  the  Offices  of  the
CFO,  Chief  Engineer,  and  Program  Analysis  and  Evaluation  to  ensure  that  it  ad-
dresses  weaknesses  associated  with  external  financial  reporting  as  well  as  internal
management decision making capabilities. A detailed, comprehensive financial man-
agement  improvement  plan  will  not  only  help  NASA  develop  and  implement  solu-
tions to its long-standing financial management problems more efficiently and effec-
tively, it will serve as a tool that will allow the Congress to oversee NASA improve-
ment  efforts  in  the  coming  months  and  years.  By  continuing  to  operate  without  an
adequate financial management improvement plan, NASA risks developing solutions
that only partially address its financial management challenges.

Second, NASA must begin implementing its plans to reengineer its contractor cost
reporting  requirements  and  processes.  Re-engineering  NASA’s  contractor  cost  re-
porting  process  is  the  key  to  ensuring  that  program  managers  and  cost  estimators
have  the  information  they  need  to  do  their  jobs  as  well  as  the  key  to  obtaining  the
information needed to properly account for billions of dollars of property, plant, and
equipment (PP&E) and materials. Although NASA has indicated that it plans to re-
engineer its contractor cost reporting requirements by October 2006, many questions
remain  unanswered  as  to  how  NASA  will  implement  these  new  requirements.  For
example,  it  is  unclear  whether  NASA  will  renegotiate  existing  contracts  to  include
new contractor reporting requirements or implement these changes prospectively as
new contracts are awarded. We suggested at the hearing that, at a minimum, NASA
pilot  the  re-engineered  contractor  cost  reporting  requirements  and  processes  using
the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV)  contract.  Further,  these  plans  do  not  consider
and  have  not  addressed  the  issue  of  property  accounting.  Until  NASA  successfully
develops a methodology to identify and record capital costs as they occur, the Agen-
cy  will  continue  to  experience  difficulties  maintaining  effective  control  over  PP&E
and ensuring that it is not vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. The key to identi-
fying and recording capital costs as they occur is ensuring that those costs are iden-
tified and reported on NASA’s contractor cost reports.

Over the next 12 months, NASA’s Office of the CFO in partnership with the Office
of  the  Chief  Engineer  and  Office  of  Program  Analysis  and  Evaluation  should,  as
part  of  a  comprehensive  financial  management  improvement  plan,  (1)  determine
what  contractor  data  are  needed  for  both  external  reporting  and  internal  manage-
ment decision making, (2) outline the steps NASA needs to take to routinely obtain
the contractor data needed, (3) determine how NASA should address deficiencies in
contractor  cost  reporting  requirements  on  existing  contracts,  (4)  ensure  that  new
contractor cost reporting requirements are included in all new contracts, and (5) as
part  of  the  disciplined  requirements  management  and  testing  process  discussed

contractors.

Finally,  NASA  must  establish  core  financial  system  requirements  that  are  con-
sistent,  verifiable,  and  traceable—containing  the  necessary  specificity  to  minimize
requirement-related  defects.  Requirements  represent  the  blueprint  that  system  de-

velopers and managers use to design, develop, and acquire a system. Improperly de-
fined  or  incomplete  requirements  have  been  commonly  identified  as  a  cause  of  sys-
tem failure, resulting in systems not meeting their costs, schedules, or performance
goals. Due in part to weaknesses in NASA’s requirements management and testing
processes,  the  core  financial  module  NASA  fielded  in  June  2003  was  not  properly
configured  or  designed  to  meet  NASA’s  financial  reporting  and  management  needs.
While  NASA  has  improved  its  requirements  management  and  testing  processes
since  it  implemented  the  core  financial  module  in  June  2003,  the  effectiveness  of
these  processes  cannot  be  determined  until  they  are  used  for  the  software  upgrade
to  the  core  financial  module,  which  is  scheduled  to  be  completed  in  October  2006.
As part of this upgrade, NASA plans to redefine the requirements for the core finan-
cial module and has cited this upgrade as the solution to many of its current IEMP
problems. However, unless NASA takes the time to effectively implement disciplined
requirements  management  and  testing  processes,  the  system  will  continue  to  fall
short of NASA’s expectations. Therefore, over the next year, it is critical that NASA
provide  the  management  support  and  sustained  leadership  needed  to  successfully
implement this important initiative.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. What  is  NASA’s  biggest  challenge  with  respect  to  improving  its  financial  man-

agement situation?

A1. While NASA has focused much attention on obtaining an unqualified or ‘‘clean’’
opinion on its financial statements, this will not be NASA’s greatest financial man-
agement  challenge.  Instead,  NASA’s  greatest  challenge  to  improving  its  financial
management  operations  will  be  ensuring  that  its  financial  management  operation
fully supports and is integrated with its program management decision making. As
we  and  others  have  reported  in  the  past,  NASA’s  financial  management  difficulties
are  rooted  in  an  agency  culture  that  has  not  viewed  financial  management  as  an
integral  part  of  the  Agency’s  program  management  decision  process.  Successfully
stabilizing and enhancing NASA’s financial management system are essential to en-
abling  the  Agency  to  provide  its  program  managers  with  the  kind  of  timely,  rel-
evant,  and  reliable  information  that  they  need  to  manage  cost,  measure  perform-
ance,  and  make  program-funding  decisions.  However,  NASA  cannot  rely  on  tech-
nology alone to solve its financial management problems. Rather, NASA must trans-
form its financial management organization into a customer-focused partner in pro-
gram results.

Clear, strong executive leadership will be critical for ensuring that NASA’s finan-
cial  management  organization  delivers  the  kind  of  analysis  and  forward-looking  in-
formation that the Agency needs to effectively manage its many complex programs.
To  be  effective,  such  leadership  must  be  combined  with  effective  organizational
alignment,  strategic  human  capital  management,  and  end-to-end  business  process
improvement.  This  goes  far  beyond  merely  obtaining  an  unqualified  audit  opinion.
It  requires  that  agency  financial  managers  focus  on  their  overall  operations  in  a
strategic  way  and  not  be  content  with  an  automated  system  that  helps  the  Agency
get  a  ‘‘clean’’  audit  opinion  once  a  year  without  providing  additional  value  to  the
program managers and cost estimators who use its financial data.
Q2. What material weakness will be the most challenging for NASA to correct?
A2. The material weakness that presents NASA with the greatest challenge to cor-
rect  will  likely  be  its  internal  controls  over  PP&E  and  materials.  As  discussed  pre-
viously, NASA has yet to develop a methodology to identify and record capital costs
as they occur—which will ultimately require NASA to re-engineer its contractor cost
reporting  processes.  As  a  result,  the  Agency  continues  to  experience  difficulties
maintaining  effective  control  over  PP&E  and  ensuring  that  it  is  not  vulnerable  to
fraud, waste, and abuse.
Q3. Given  the  fact  that  NASA  has  implemented  a  new  travel  system,  why  is  NASA

having difficulty tracking and reporting travel costs?

A3. Many  of  the  problems  we  encountered  when  trying  to  obtain  information  on
NASA’s  travel  costs  during  our  recent  audit  of  NASA’s  utilization  of  passenger  air-
craft  can  be  linked  to  weaknesses  associated  with  NASA’s  financial  management
system. However, NASA’s failure to properly classify the cost associated with its use
of  passenger  aircraft  as  a  travel  expense  was  not  a  system-related  weakness.  In-
stead, it was a failure on the part of NASA to fully understand how it does business
and  properly  capture  the  cost  associated  with  doing  business.  According  to  NASA
officials,  the  only  expenditures  it  classifies  as  travel  related  costs  are  (1)  expendi-

tures  that  are  submitted  on  employee  travel  vouchers  through  NASA’s  travel  man-
ager  system  and  (2)  centrally  billed  travel  card  expenditures.  Travel  expenditures
that were paid for on contract were not captured as a travel related cost. For exam-
ple,  it  was  not  uncommon  for  NASA  to  utilize  its  own  passenger  aircraft  or  other
charter  aircraft  services  as  a  means  of  transportation  for  business  travel.  However,
because  NASA  paid  for  these  passenger  aircraft  services  using  a  contract,  expendi-
tures associated with this travel were not classified as a travel cost.
Q4. Will  NASA’s  planned  core  financial  system  upgrade  address  the  problems  de-
scribed by GAO and NASA’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) at the hearing
and is NASA’s process for integrating the upgrade into the existing system struc-
ture  intended  to  avoid  the  kind  of  problems  that  accompanied  the  rollout  of  the
original core financial module?

A4. It is too early to predict whether NASA’s planned core financial system upgrade
will  address  the  problems  we  and  the  NASA  OIG  have  outlined  in  our  testimonies
or  whether  NASA’s  upgrade  process  will  avert  the  kind  of  problems  that  accom-
panied the rollout of the original core financial module. NASA’s success will depend
on whether the Agency follows the disciplined requirement management and testing
processes we have recommended in our prior reports on this topic. As discussed pre-
viously, unless NASA takes the time to effectively implement these disciplined proc-
esses,  the  system  will  continue  to  fall  short  of  NASA’s  expectations.  This  will  re-
quire  more  than  just  CFO  involvement.  The  mission  functions  of  NASA  will  need
to play a key role in determining what the new system needs to provide and event-
driven project schedules will need to be developed to support this upgrade. If NASA
views  the  upgrade  as  a  ‘‘fix’’  for  its  financial  statement  problems  and  adopts  the
same  schedule-driven  approach  that  was  used  in  its  original  efforts,  then  the  up-
grade  has  little  likelihood  of  addressing  the  long-standing  financial  management
system weaknesses.

Further,  many  of  the  financial  management  problems  we  and  the  OIG  have  dis-
cussed—including  problems  associated  with  providing  program  managers  and  cost
estimators  with  the  information  they  need  to  do  their  jobs  and  obtaining  the  infor-
mation  needed  to  properly  account  for  PP&E  and  material—will  not  be  resolved  by
the systems upgrade alone. As discussed previously, re-engineering NASA’s business
processes—including its contractor cost reporting process—will be the key to resolv-
ing many of NASA’s most challenging financial management problems.

We are currently undertaking a review of the Core Financial System Upgrade and

will advise the Committee of any concerns when our work is completed.
Q5. With respect to NASA’s failure to develop a complete enterprise architecture, you
asked  us  what  specific  information  is  lacking  that  would  affect  NASA’s  ability
to complete its financial management system?

A5. The  enterprise  architecture  provides  the  authoritative  frame  of  reference
against  which  program  or  system-specific  requirements  (e.g.,  functional,  perform-
ance,  data,  security)  can  be  vetted  to  ensure  that  they  are  in  alignment  with  cor-
responding enterprise-wide requirements. Without this frame of reference, program-
specific  requirements  and  subsequent  design  decisions  for  individual  program  and
system  investments,  like  the  financial  management  system  modernization,  may
later  prove  inconsistent  with  the  kind  of  enterprise-wide  standards  needed  to
achieve  integration  and  avoid  overlap.  It  is  this  lack  of  enterprise-wide  information
that  would  affect  an  agency’s  ability  to  complete  a  financial  management  system
modernization,  for  example,  in  a  way  that  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Agency  as
a whole.
Q6. Is  it  accurate  to  say  that  the  enterprise  architecture  is  for  the  most  part  not  the
Chief Financial Officer’s responsibility? If the delay in developing that architec-
ture  is  a  primary  reason  for  the  difficulties  experienced  in  the  CFO  office,  who
should Congress hold accountable?

A6. An enterprise architecture is a tool to guide and constrain business and system
investments in a way that promotes integration and minimizes overlap and duplica-
tion  across  an  organization.  Thus,  enterprise  architecture  management  best  prac-
tices  and  federal  guidance  assign  responsibility  and  accountability  for  its  develop-
ment and use to a senior-level, executive committee or board, reporting to the head
of the organization and consisting of the business leaders from across the organiza-
tion.  Such  an  executive-level  body  would  include  the  CFO,  who  would  thus  share
responsibility  and  accountability  for  the  enterprise  architecture’s  development  and
use.  Ultimate  accountability  and  responsibility  for  the  architecture  would  reside
with the NASA Administrator.

Q7. What  other  effects  is  the  lack  of  a  complete  enterprise  architecture  having  on

management at NASA?

A7. Our  work  at  NASA  has  focused  on  the  development  and  use  of  an  enterprise
architecture  relative  to  NASA’s  financial  management  system.  We  have  not  at-
tempted  to  examine  other  effects  related  to  NASA  having  operated  without  an  en-
terprise architecture.
