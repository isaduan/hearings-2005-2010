NOMINATION  OF  CARLOS  M.  GUTIERREZ  TO 

BE  SECRETARY  OF  COMMERCE 

WEDNESDAY,  JANUARY  5,  2005

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  4  p.m.  in  room  SR–
253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Ted  Stevens,  Chairman 
of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS,

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The  CHAIRMAN.  The  hearing  on  the  nomination  of  Carlos
Gutierrez  to  be  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  will  come  to  order.  It’s 
a  pleasure  to  have  some  new  Members.  I’ll  welcome  them  later. 
We’ll begin now, and in order that Senator Levin may return, Sen-
ator Inouye and I will make our statements after you make yours, 
Carl. 

I’m  pleased  to  call  the  Senator  from  Michigan  to  introduce  our 

nominee. 

STATEMENT OF HON. CARL LEVIN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN 

Senator LEVIN. Well, I’m very grateful for that, Senator Stevens, 

Senator Inouye. 

Senator  Pryor,  I  see  you’re  in  your  traditional  position  on  the 
Committee.  We  lost  Senator  Pryor  to  the  Armed  Services  Com-
mittee, where he was sitting in a very similar position; and, there-
fore,  we  were  unable  to  retain  him.  But  he’ll  make  a  terrific  con-
tribution to this Committee. 

But,  Mr.  Chairman,  congratulations  to  you  on  your  new  duties 

here. And, Senator Inouye, it’s always great to see you. 

And  it’s  particularly  a  pleasure  for  me  to  be  with  Carlos
Gutierrez here this afternoon. He is somebody that we’re very, very 
proud  of  in  Michigan,  as  CEO  and  president  of  the  Kellogg  Com-
pany.  He  has  done  wonderful  things  with  that  company.  It’s  on  a 
very  strong  financial  footing,  for  many  reasons;  particularly,  the 
community  that  it  is  centralized  and  localized  in,  but  also  because 
of his leadership. 

His experience in running various parts of the Kellogg Company 
across  this  globe  will  help  him  to  be  a  tremendous  Secretary  of 
Commerce. He worked, really, up from the bottom rung of the Kel-
logg ladder. He came to the United States when he was 7 years old, 
and  his  first  job  with  Kellogg’s  was  delivering  cereal  from  a  van,

stocking  the  shelves,  I  believe,  in  Mexico,  and  working  himself  up 
from  there  so  that,  during  his  career  with  Kellogg’s,  he  has  man-
aged  several  international  divisions,  including  general  manager  of 
Kellogg of Mexico, president and CEO of Kellogg Canada, president 
of  Kellogg  Asia  Pacific.  And  this  vast  business  experience  in  the 
United  States  and  abroad  has  given  him  a  unique  understanding 
of  our  country’s  role  and  the  challenges  that  we  face  in  the  global 
marketplace. 

We  need  greater  access  to  foreign  markets;  he  knows  that  first-
hand. We need to address the soaring trade deficit; he understands 
that  firsthand.  And  he  also,  in  addition  to  coming  from  mid-Amer-
ica,  the  Heartland  of  America,  in  a  mid-sized  town,  Battle  Creek, 
he  understands  the  values  of  mid-America  and  the  value  of  hard 
work.  He  also  understands  some  of  the  challenges  that  we  face  in 
the  manufacturing  sectors  of  America,  because—Kellogg  being,  of 
course, a major manufacturer. 

Mr.  Gutierrez  also  represents  the  quintessential  American 
dream—as I said, emigrating to America when he was 7 years old, 
from Cuba, and then working himself up the ranks of Kellogg. 

His  story  is  as  American  as  cornflakes  and  baseball,  and  he’s  a 
fan of both. Of course, being born in Cuba, I think he probably had 
that love of baseball even before he reached here, but it’s been em-
phasized, I’m sure, significantly as an American. 

His  home,  in  Battle  Creek,  Michigan—again,  a  medium-sized 
mid-western  city  in  our  heartland—he’s  got  a  very  firm  grounding 
in  the  values  and  strengths  that  make  our  country  great,  and  he’s 
got  a  firm  grasp  of  the  challenges  that  face  American  manufactur-
ers in the global economy that we are in. 

So I know this Committee will address this nomination speedily, 
as  well  as  thoroughly.  I  couldn’t  be  more  pleased  than  to  be  here 
for just these few minutes to introduce Carlos Gutierrez to our col-
leagues. And I see Senator Stabenow is now at my side. So for both 
of us, representing Michigan, it is a real privilege and an honor to 
represent a man who stands for so many of the values that we be-
lieve  in  here  in  this  country,  and  that  we  represent  in  the  U.S. 
Senate. 

And,  again,  I  thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  allowing 
me  to  go  first  so  that  I  could  return  to  the  Armed  Services  Com-
mittee. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Levin follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. CARL LEVIN, U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  it  is  my  privilege  to  introduce 
President  Bush’s  Commerce  secretary  nominee,  Carlos  Gutierrez,  Chairman  of  the 
Board and CEO of Michigan’s Kellogg Company. 

I  am  delighted  with  this  choice  and  heartily  support  the  nomination  of  Mr. 
Gutierrez to be Secretary of Commerce. Mr. Gutierrez has vast business experience 
in  the  United  States  and  abroad,  which  gives  him  a  unique  understanding  of  our 
country’s role and challenges in the global marketplace. 

During  his  time  at  Kellogg,  Mr.  Gutierrez  managed  several  of  the  company’s 
international divisions, including serving as the general manager of Kellogg of Mex-
ico,  the  president  and  CEO  of  Kellogg  Canada  Inc.,  and  the  president  of  Kellogg 
Asia-Pacific.  These  experiences  provide  him  with  the  expertise  needed  to  address 
our  soaring  trade  deficit  and  create  a  climate  where  U.S.  products  have  the  same 
access to foreign markets as we give in this county to foreign products. 

Mr.  Gutierrez  represents  the  quintessential  American  dream,  emigrating  to  this 
country  with  his  parents  at  the  age  of  7  from  Cuba  and  working  his  way  up  the

ranks of the Kellogg company, starting with selling Kellogg cereal from a van, stock-
ing  the  shelves  of  his  customers,  to  becoming  the  highly  respected  President  and 
CEO  of  a  top  American  Fortune  500  Company.  His  story  is  as  American  as  Corn 
Flakes and baseball, of both of which he is a passionate fan. 

Mr.  Gutierrez’s  home  is  in  Battle  Creek,  Michigan,  a  medium-sized,  mid-western 
city in America’s heartland. Mr. Gutierrez has a firm grounding in many of the val-
ues  and  strengths  that  make  this  country  great.  He  also  has  a  firm  grasp  of  some 
of the challenges facing American manufacturers. 

The  U.S.  has  battled  for  decades  to  open  foreign  markets  to  U.S.  goods.  Carlos 
Gutierrez  knows  the  ropes  of  those  markets  and  can  provide  this  nation  with  that 
invaluable  experience.  I  have  confidence  that  he  will  recommend  firm  action  both 
to pry open foreign markets now closed or partially closed to American goods as well 
as to reinvigorate America’s manufacturing base. 

I  urge  the  Committee  to  report  Mr.  Gutierrez’s  nomination  favorably  as  soon  as 
possible  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  him  in  this  new  and  important  role  as 
Secretary of Commerce.

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you,  Senator  Levin.  We’re  delighted  to 

Senator  Stabenow,  we’d  be  pleased  to  have  your  remarks  con-

have you come. 

cerning the nominee. 

STATEMENT OF HON. DEBBIE A. STABENOW,

U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN 

Senator  STABENOW.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Ranking 

Member Inouye. 

I’m  very  pleased  to  be  here  today  with  all  of  you.  And  I  do  also 
want  to  clarify—when  Senator  Levin  talks  about  ‘‘cornflakes,’’  it  is 
‘‘Kellogg Corn Flakes’’ that we are speaking about here. That’s im-
portant. 

But I am very pleased to be here to support the nomination and 
present to you a fellow Michiganian as our next Secretary of Com-
merce.  Carlos  Gutierrez  is  a  man  with  a  remarkable  story.  As  you 
have  heard  on  many  occasions,  his  impressive  background  reveals 
a  shining  example  of  an  individual  who  came  to  America,  to  our 
nation  of  immigrants,  and  enjoyed  a  very  real  opportunity  to  pur-
sue the American Dream, which he continues to pursue today. 

Mr. Gutierrez was born in Havana, Cuba. His father was a pine-
apple  merchant  in  Havana  before  he  brought  his  family  to  the 
United  States.  From  this  humble  beginning,  Mr.  Gutierrez  has 
risen  to  become  one  of  the  most  respected  and  influential  Latino 
leaders  in  American  business  today,  and,  I  would  say,  most  re-
spected leaders in business today, as well. 

Our  Secretary-designate  first  joined  Kellogg  in  Mexico  City  at 
age  20,  with  an  entry-level  sales  and  delivery  job.  And  by  age  30, 
Mr.  Gutierrez  was  general  manager  of  Kellogg’s  Mexican  oper-
ations, truly an impressive story. 

In  1982,  Kellogg  promoted  and  transferred  him  to  the  corporate 
headquarters  in  Battle  Creek,  Michigan.  There,  he  continued  to 
rise through the executive ranks to become Kellogg’s president and 
chief executive officer in April 1999. 

Mr.  Gutierrez  has  been  an  effective  and  visionary  leader  at  Kel-
logg. When he began his leadership, sales were flagging. He turned 
things  around,  he  reduced  the  company’s  debt—we  could  use  your 
help—and  increased  net  sales  by  43  percent,  helping  to  make  Kel-
logg the number-one cereal-maker in the United States.

Now, more than ever, our nation needs a strong leader to create 
jobs  here  at  home.  The  loss  of  2.8  million  manufacturing  jobs,  and 
increased outsourcing, continues to hurt millions of American fami-
lies.  And  we  need  his  help  in  Michigan,  as  well,  where  we’ve  lost 
over 225,000 jobs over the last 4 years. That number puts Michigan 
near  the  top  of  the  list  of  states  in  the  country  with  the  highest 
number of recent job losses. And I’m so appreciative of his insight, 
coming from Michigan. 

With his experience, Mr. Gutierrez is, without a doubt, the right 
man  for  the  job.  His  journey  from  the  bottom  of  the  corporate  lad-
der  to  the  top  shows  how  big  dreams  can  triumph  over  traditional 
barriers, and he draws on the lessons of his journey to help create 
new opportunities for America’s next generation of leaders. 

Mr.  Gutierrez  is  co-trustee  of  the  W.K.  Kellogg  Foundation, 
which is such an important source of investment and—creating op-
portunities  in  Michigan,  as  well  as  around  the  world.  In  1997,  the 
Foundation launched one of the single largest philanthropic efforts 
in  the  country  to  increase  educational  opportunities  for  Latinos,  a 
group  with  one  of  the  top  high  school  dropout  rates  in  the  United 
States. 

That’s one of many, many reasons that I am pleased that Carlos 
Gutierrez  will  be  a  member  of  the  President’s  Cabinet.  I  wish  him 
the  best  as  he  takes  on  the  challenges  of  this  new  assignment, 
working  on  business  and  commerce  issues  that  affect  families  in 
Michigan, across the country, and around the world. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  pleased  to  be  here  to  support  the  nomina-
tion  of  Carlos  Gutierrez,  and  I  hope  the  Committee  and  the  full 
Senate will confirm him as soon as possible. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Stabenow follows:]

Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member  Inouye.  I  am  very  pleased  to  be

That’s important.

The  loss  of  2.8  million  manufacturing  jobs  and  increased  outsourcing  continues  to 
hurt millions of American families.

Thank you.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator. 
Mr.  Gutierrez,  you  come  very  well  recommended  by  your  state’s 
Senators, and I’m delighted that this first hearing of this Congress 
starts  off  on  a  truly  bipartisan  basis,  with  the  Senators  endorsing 
the  President’s  nomination  that  you  take  the  position  of  Secretary 
of Commerce. 

This is, sort of, a different Committee. Senator Inouye and I have 
served  together  now  for  31⁄2 decades  or  more,  and  we  have  formed 
a  partnership,  really,  in  many  ways,  and  conduct  our  business  in 
a  different  way.  So  I  will  be  greeting  the  new  Members  here  soon, 
and  make  some  comments.  But  we  hope  that  we  can  start  off  lis-
tening  to  witnesses.  We’d  like  to  hear  your  statement  first,  and 
then we’ll make our comments. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary? 

STATEMENT OF CARLOS M. GUTIERREZ, NOMINEE TO BE 

SECRETARY OF COMMERCE 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
If  I  may,  sir,  I  would  like  to  briefly  introduce  my  family,  who’s 
with  me  today.  Sitting  behind  me  is  my  wife  Edilia,  of  25  years. 
We  met  in  Mexico,  at  the  time  when  I  was  there  with  Kellogg.  To 
her left is our youngest daughter, Karina, who is 18 and currently 
lives  in  Florida.  And  to  her  left,  is  Erica,  21,  a  resident  of  Michi-
gan.  And  then,  to  her  left,  is  my  son,  Carlos,  Jr.,  who  is  24.  And 
thank you for allowing me to introduce them. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  we’re  delighted  to  have  you  with  us,  as 
members of the future Secretary’s family, and we note the beautiful 
daughters, Mr. Secretary. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, sir. Thank you. I think they’ve been 

harder to manage than the Kellogg Company, sir.

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Inouye,  and  Members  of  the  Committee, 
I  thank  you  very  much  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you

very  kind  and  generous  introductions.  I’m  grateful  for  your  cour-
tesy  and  support,  and  I’m  very  grateful  for  the  kindness  shown  to 
me  by  Members  of  Congress  during  this  process.  I  have  welcomed 
the advice—it’s been very helpful—and the views that many of you 
have shared with me, in person or by phone. 

Before  proceeding,  if  I  may,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  how 
humbled  and  honored  I  am  that  President  Bush  would  ask  me  to 
work  in  his  Cabinet.  If  confirmed,  I  will  be  proud  to  work  under 
his leadership. 

I  am  especially  appreciative  of  the  tremendous  opportunity  to 
build  on  the  accomplishments  achieved  at  the  Commerce  Depart-
ment  under  Secretary  Evans’  distinguished  and  exemplary  leader-
ship, as well as those of his predecessors. 

Today,  I  would  like  to  give  you  a  better  sense,  briefly,  of  who  I 
am  and  what  I  believe  I  can  do  for  our  country  as  Secretary  of 
Commerce,  if  given  that  opportunity.  Most  of  all,  I  hope  to  leave 
you  with  a  clear  understanding  of  my  commitment  to  the  ideals  of 
our  country,  and  of  my  strong  support  for  the  Commerce  Depart-
ment’s  mission  of  creating  conditions  for  economic  growth  and  op-
portunity  by  promoting  innovation,  entrepreneurship,  competitive-
ness, and environmental stewardship. 

My  passion  for  this  country  is  rooted  in  the  opportunities  I  re-
ceived after coming to America as a young Cuban refugee with my 
family. We arrived with few material possessions, but we had many 
dreams at that time. 

My  parents  instilled  in  me  a  belief  that,  in  the  United  States, 
one  could  achieve  almost  anything  through  hard  work,  determina-
tion, and the hunger and the humility to learn. They taught me the 
noble  American  values  of  personal  liberty  and  personal  responsi-
bility, and the importance of both to our democratic and free-enter-
prise system. 

When my parents and my brother and I became U.S. citizens, in 
a  Brooklyn,  New  York,  courtroom,  in  1965,  I  can  assure  you,  I  be-
lieve  it  was  one  of  my  father’s  proudest  moments,  as  it  was  when 
my whole family and children became U.S. citizens. 

After  I  joined  the  Kellogg  Company,  in  1975,  I  focused  on  doing 
my  very  best  at  each  job,  as  a  way  of  preparing  myself  for  the  op-
portunities  that  may  arise  in  the  future.  This  approach  served  me 
well, leading to wonderful experiences in Kellogg, including impor-
tant  managerial  assignments  on  four  continents.  Ultimately,  I  as-
sumed the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. But little 
did  I  imagine—little  did  I  imagine—that  I  would  be  preparing  for 
the challenges of public service as Secretary of Commerce. 

I welcome the prospect of this new challenge and the opportunity 
to  give  back  something  to  the  country  that  has  provided  us  with 
so  much.  My  journey,  from  young  refugee  to  the  leadership  of  a 
great  American  company,  has  prepared  me  to  do  so  by  engraining 
in  me  a  deep  appreciation  of  the  individual  contributions  made 
by—and the challenges facing—employees at all levels of American 
industry. I also developed a keen sense of the forces of global com-

petition  that  will  continue  to  reshape  our  business  environment  in 
the years to come. 

Drawing  on  these  experiences,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  hope  to 
pursue several goals as Secretary of Commerce, including, one, fos-
tering  the  environment  in  which  our  free-enterprise  system  will 
flourish  by  serving  as  an  advocate  for  reducing  trade  and  regu-
latory  barriers  that  unreasonably  burden  our  businesses  and  their 
workers;  two,  collaborating  with  the  U.S.  Trade  Representative 
both  in  the  negotiation  of  sound  trade  agreements  that  will  open 
markets  to  U.S.  exports  and  in  vigorous  challenges  to  policies  and 
practices  abroad  that  violate  those  agreements;  three,  enhancing 
management  of  our  marine  resources,  especially  our  marine  fish-
eries  and  threatened  marine  ecosystems;  and,  finally,  developing 
greater  analytical  and  predictive  capabilities  concerning  the  global 
climate  system,  including  an  enhanced  forecasting  capability  with 
regard  to  potentially  hazardous  weather  and  maritime  conditions. 
And  I  know  this  is  a  subject  that  is  very  much  top-of-mind,  given 
the recent tragedies in several countries off the Indian Ocean. 

I  recognize  that  the  continued  success  of  the  Commerce  Depart-
ment  will  require  collaboration  across  all  departments  of  the  U.S. 
Government  and  with  Congress.  If  confirmed,  I  would  serve  as  a 
committed  and  inclusive  leader  that  builds  bridges  across  bound-
aries,  whether  it  be  political,  cultural,  economic,  or  geographic.  I 
would  work  with  all  stakeholders  to  generate  effective  ideas  and 
actions.  And  just  as  I  have  insisted  at  the  Kellogg  Company,  I 
pledge  to  maintain  the  highest  standards  of  integrity  in  the  man-
ner in which the Department conducts its business. 

I  have  been  blessed  with  the  rewards  of  American  freedom,  and 
I  have  a  great  confidence  in  the  direction  of  the  country  and  the 
prosperity of this great country. I am eager to work with the Mem-
bers  of  this  Committee  and  other  Members  of  Congress  to  find 
ways to help our fellow Americans realize their dreams, as well. 

In  closing,  I  wish  to  thank  my  family  for  their  support  in  this 
new endeavor. I believe if we—if confirmed, Mr. Chairman, and we 
move to Washington, that would be about our 15th move since my 
wife  and  I  were  married.  They  have  supported  me  in  all  others, 
and we have undertaken this whole journey together. 

I  would  also  be  remiss  if  I  did  not  recognize  and  thank  the 
25,000  employees  of  the  Kellogg  Company  who  have  had  a  great 
deal to do with my personal success. 

I  thank  this  Committee,  again,  for  the  time  provided  to  address 
you  today.  And  I  also  want  to  thank  President  Bush  for  the  con-
fidence that he has expressed in me. 

That concludes my statement. Thank you, again. And I would be 

pleased to address any of your questions at this point in time. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gutierrez follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CARLOS M. GUTIERREZ, NOMINEE TO BE SECRETARY OF 

COMMERCE 

Mr. Chairman, Senator Inouye, and Members of the Committee: 
Thank you very much for the opportunity to appear before you this morning. And 
thank you, Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow, for those kind and generous intro-
ductions.  I  am  grateful  for  your  courtesy  and  support,  as  I  am  for  the  kindness 
shown  to  me  by  all  Members  of  Congress  so  far  in  this  process.  I  have  welcomed

the  helpful  advice  and  views  many  of  you  have  shared  with  me,  in  person  or  by 
phone. 

Hearing your perspectives and your ideas has given me an even greater apprecia-
tion for the significant responsibilities of the Secretary of Commerce, and for the im-
portant  work  that  lies  ahead.  There  clearly  is  a  shared  understanding  of  the  eco-
nomic challenges that our nation faces, both at home and abroad; and just as impor-
tant,  a  sincere  commitment  to  work  together  to  create  an  even  more  robust  econ-
omy, one in which all of our fellow Americans fully share. If confirmed, I very much 
hope to work closely with the Members of this Committee to advance the best inter-
ests of our country. 

Before  proceeding,  if  I  may,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  how  humbled  and  hon-
ored  I  am  that  President  Bush  would  ask  me  to  work  in  his  Cabinet.  If  confirmed, 
I  would  be  proud  to  work  under  his  leadership.  And  I  am  especially  appreciative 
of  the  tremendous  opportunity  to  build  on  the  accomplishments  achieved  at  the 
Commerce Department under Secretary Evans’ distinguished and exemplary leader-
ship, as well as those of his predecessors. 

Today,  I  would  like  to  briefly  give  you  a  better  sense  of  who  I  am  and  what  I 
believe I can do for our country as Secretary of Commerce if given that opportunity. 
Most  of  all,  I  hope  to  leave  you  with  a  clear  understanding  of  my  commitment  to 
the ideals of our country and of my strong support for the Commerce Department’s 
mission of creating conditions for economic growth and opportunity by promoting in-
novation, entrepreneurship, competitiveness, and environmental stewardship. 

My passion for this country is rooted in the opportunities I received after coming 
to America as a young Cuban refugee with my family. We arrived with few material 
possessions,  but  we  had  many  dreams.  My  parents  instilled  in  me  the  belief  that 
in  the  United  States,  one  could  achieve  almost  anything  through  hard  work,  deter-
mination,  and  the  hunger  and  the  humility  to  learn.  They  taught  me  the  noble 
American values of personal liberty and personal responsibility, and the importance 
of  both  to  our  democratic  and  free  enterprise  system.  When  my  parents  and  their 
two  sons  became  U.S.  citizens  in  a  Brooklyn,  NY  courtroom  in  1965,  it  was  one  of 
my father’s proudest moments. 

After  I  joined  the  Kellogg  Company  in  1975,  I  focused  on  doing  my  very  best  at 
each  job,  as  a  way  of  preparing  for  whatever  the  next  opportunity  would  be.  This 
approach served me well, leading to wonderful experiences in Kellogg, including im-
portant managerial assignments on four continents. Ultimately, I assumed the roles 
of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer—but my approach remained the same. I’ve 
worked  hard  at  my  current  positions.  But  little  did  I  imagine  that  I  might  be  pre-
paring for the challenges of public service, as Secretary of Commerce! 

I welcome the prospect of this newest challenge, and the opportunity to give back 
something  to  the  country  that  has  provided  me  with  so  much.  My  journey  from 
young  refugee  to  the  leadership  of  a  great  American  company  has  prepared  me  to 
do so, by engraining in me a deep appreciation of the individual contributions made 
by—and  the  challenges  facing—employees  at  all  levels  of  American  industry.  I  also 
developed  a  keen  sense  of  the  forces  of  global  competition  that  will  continue  to  re-
shape our business environment in the years to come. 

Drawing  on  my  experiences,  I  thus  hope  to  pursue  several  goals  as  Secretary  of 

Commerce, including:

1)  Fostering  the  environment  in  which  our  free  enterprise  system  will  flourish, 
by  serving  as  an  advocate  for  reducing  trade  and  regulatory  barriers  that  un-
reasonably burden our businesses and their workers;
2)  Collaborating  with  the  U.S.  Trade  Representative  both  in  the  negotiation  of 
sound trade agreements that will open markets to U.S. exports, and in vigorous 
challenges to policies and practices abroad that violate those agreements;
3)  Enhancing  management  of  our  marine  resources,  especially  our  marine  fish-
eries and threatened marine ecosystems; and
4)  Finally,  developing  greater  analytical  and  predictive  capabilities  concerning 
the global climate system, including an enhanced forecasting capability with re-
gard to potentially hazardous weather and maritime conditions.

I  recognize  that  the  continued  success  of  the  Commerce  Department  will  require 
collaboration across all departments of the United States Government and with the 
Congress.  If  confirmed,  I  would  serve  as  a  committed  and  inclusive  leader  that 
builds bridges across boundaries—whether it be political, cultural, economic, or geo-
graphic.  I  would  work  with  all  stakeholders  to  generate  effective  ideas  and  actions. 
And just as I have insisted at the Kellogg company, I pledge to maintain the highest 
standard  of  ethics  in  the  manner  in  which  the  Department  conducts  its  business.

I have been blessed with the rewards of America’s freedoms, and I have great con-
fidence in our nation’s direction and future prosperity. I am eager to work with the 
Members  of  this  Committee,  and  other  Members  of  Congress,  to  find  ways  to  help 
our fellow Americans realize their dreams as well. 

In  closing,  I  wish  to  thank  my  family  for  their  support  in  this  new  endeavor,  as 
they  have  supported  me  in  all  others  we  previously  have  undertaken  together.  I 
would  also  be  remiss  if  I  did  not  recognize  and  thank  the  25,000  employees  of  the 
Kellogg  Company  who  have  had  a  great  deal  to  do  with  my  success.  I  thank  this 
Committee again for the time provided to address you today. And I thank President 
Bush for the confidence that he has expressed in me. 

That  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  pleased  to  address  your  questions  at 

this time.

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Gutierrez.  Yours  is 

an inspiring story, and——
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, sir. 
The  CHAIRMAN.—we  all  share  your  feelings  about  the  oppor-
tunity you now have at this magnificent Department. As I said be-
fore  the  hearing,  you’ll  see  much  more  of  us  than  you  really  want 
to  see  of  us;  but  it  will  be  a  working  partnership,  we  assure  you. 
And  we’re  very  pleased  that  you  have  brought  your  wife  and  chil-
dren along with you today to be with you. 

You  come  before  us  at  a  time  when  there’s  been  significant 
change to the American economy. The shock of September 11th, the 
series  of  corporate  scandals,  and  the  pressures  of  spending  on  the 
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the war against terror generally 
really  are  taking  their  toll,  as  far  as  our  national  scene  is  con-
cerned.  The  President’s  economic  stimulus  program  and  tax  relief 
that  we  put  into  effect  are  helping.  There  are  a  whole  series  of 
issues  we’ll  face  as  we  go  forward.  We’ll  be  guided  by  your  advice, 
in terms of changes for the future. 

You will find most of your budget is devoted to the National Oce-
anic  and  Atmospheric  Administration.  NOAA’s  programs  will  be  a 
major  focus  of  this  Committee’s  efforts.  We’ll  seek  to  reauthorize 
the  Magnuson-Stevens  Act,  the  Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act, 
the  Coastal  Zone  Management  Act,  and  other  laws  affecting  the 
use  of  the  marine  environment.  And  we’ll  review  the  report  of  the 
U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. We have a whole series of other 
issues  before  us,  from  all  forms  of  transportation,  communication, 
science,  and  space.  This  Committee’s  jurisdiction  is  extremely 
broad,  and  we  intend  to  pursue  all  of  these  areas  to  the  utmost 
during this period of time. 

As I said, Senator Inouye and I have worked together now for so 
many years. We have never found an issue we couldn’t resolve ami-
cably.  I  don’t  think  we’ve  ever  had  an  argument  and  we  don’t  in-
tend  to  break  that  record.  So  I  commend  the  Committee  to  work 
with  us  on  a  bipartisan  basis  to  try  to  resolve  some  of  the  issues 
that will come before us. 

And  I  want  to  take  the  time,  before  I  recognize  my  colleague,  to 
recognize  Senator  Ben  Nelson,  and  Senator  Pryor  and  Senator 
DeMint  and  Senator  Vitter,  who  are  new  Members.  They  will  be 
confirmed  in  those  roles  tomorrow,  but  we’re  meeting  today  with 
the  idea  that  we’ll  probably  meet  off  the  floor,  after  the  first  vote, 
to  vote  on  the  nomination,  because  I  don’t  think  we’ll  have  a  full 
quorum here today.

We  have  a  little  problem:  Our  colleagues  have  not  been  con-
firmed as Members of the Committee yet, and we haven’t been con-
firmed as chairmen yet. It’s one of those things. 

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  I  just  want  to  close,  before  I  introduce  my  col-
league  and  ask  him  for  his  comments,  we’ll  go  through  a  round  of 
5  minutes  each.  Members  can  make  a  statement  or  ask  questions. 
After  the  first  round,  we’ll  go  back  through  again,  if  that’s  nec-
essary.  But  I  do  hope  that  Members  will  keep  in  mind,  as  we  go 
through  these  hearings,  that  we  want  full  participation,  and  we 
will  recognize  Members  based  on  the  time  that  they  come  to  the 
hearing,  at  this  and  all  hearings.  It’s  the  early  bird  rule,  which  I 
think is the fairest way to handle matters. And Senator Inouye and 
I have followed that procedure in other areas, and we intend to fol-
low it now. 

So, let me call on my colleague, Senator Inouye, at this time. 

STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE,

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

Senator INOUYE. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
I  wish  to  join  my  Chairman  in  welcoming  you,  Mr.  Gutierrez,  to 
your  first  appearance  before  this  Committee.  You  may  not  be 
aware of this, but it’s through sheer determination that we’re meet-
ing today. As you noted, we’re not technically confirmed to do this, 
but that’s how we do business. 

in 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Chairman,  when  Mr.  Gutierrez  and  I  met 
in December, we discussed many things. As he noted in his opening 
statement,  he  said  that  it  is  critical  that  the  Department  play  an 
active  role 
linking  businesses  with  market  opportunities 
throughout  the  world,  supporting  our  companies  where  needed, 
and, I think, ensuring that the Department’s role in our embassies 
is expanded. And I look forward to working with you on these and 
many  other  important  matters  within  the  Department’s  jurisdic-
tion. 

As  you’ve  noted,  Mr.  Gutierrez,  in  the  past  2  weeks  we’ve  seen 
photos  after  photos  of  devastation,  death,  and  misery  throughout 
the Indian Ocean area. The unprecedented loss of life and devasta-
tion  is  beyond  comprehension.  And  living  in  an  island  state  in  the 
midst of volcanic activity, such as Hawaii, the people of Hawaii are 
very  well  aware  of  the  destructive  power  of  tsunamis.  And  the 
Chairman,  who  is  from  Alaska,  is  also  familiar  with  the  threats 
posed  by  earthquakes  and  tsunamis  to  our  coastal  communities. 
And  that’s  why  we  have  worked  together  very  closely,  throughout 
the many years, to increase our support for the funding of NOAA’s 
tsunami  warning  program,  including  warning  sensors  in  Hawaii 
and Alaska. 

Despite  our  efforts,  much  more  must  be  done.  And,  as  you  are 
well  aware,  85  percent  of  all  the  tsunamis  occur  in  the  Pacific 
Ocean  area,  and  we  spend  about  $10  million  annually  for  the  Pa-
cific system. We have only six buoys deployed; we need at least 12 
more.  And  I’m  assured  that  the  expansion  will  be  completed,  not 
next  year,  but  in  the  next  7  years,  and  I  think  that  is  not  accept-
able,  with  what  is  happening  out  there.  We  have  the  technology,

11

we  have  the  system  in  place.  All  we  need  is  the  commitment  to 
carry this out. And I think with your commitment, we can do this. 

So I look forward to working with you, Mr. Gutierrez——
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator  INOUYE.—to  assure  that  our  Department  has  adequate 
resources to address this matter and fulfil your many other impor-
tant responsibilities. 

And I’ll wait for my second turn. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  let  me  just  take  this  occasion,  Mr.  Sec-
retary,  if  you  will—I’d  like  to  introduce  the  Chief  of  Staff  of  the 
Committee  now,  Lisa  Sutherland,  who’s  been  with  me  for  many 
years,  and  General  Counsel  of  this  Committee  will  be  David  Rus-
sell. The Deputy Chief of Staff will be Christine Drager. The Press 
Secretary will be Melanie Alvord. 

I  only  have  one  question  to  ask  before  we  yield  under  the  early-

bird rule. 

I noticed a report yesterday that the board of Kellogg has grant-
ed you special consideration on the pension plan, based upon a de-
termination  that  you  had  not  quite  reached  30  years.  It’s  my  un-
derstanding  the  board  will  compensate  you  beginning,  I  guess, 
when you leave government, or 2009, on a basis that you had com-
pleted the full 30 years. How far were you from reaching 30 years, 
Mr. Gutierrez? 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I will—I would have my 30-

year anniversary on September 1st, 2005. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  And  this  determination,  as  I  understand  it,  was 

filed with the SEC? 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, sir, it was filed through an 8–K report, and 
it  was  a  determination  made  by  the  board  of  directors,  which  is  a 
body,  in  our  company,  made  up  of  all  independent  directors,  with 
the exception of myself. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  And  that  compensation  is  roughly  equivalent  to 

what it would have been if you had served the full 30 years? 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, sir. Yes, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Under the early-bird rule, I now recognize Senator Pryor. 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR,

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And in lieu of making 
an  opening  statement,  I  would  just  like  to  submit  my  prepared 
statement for the record. I would also like to say thank you for wel-
coming  me  to  this  Committee.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you 
and  Senator  Inouye  and  everybody  on  this  Committee.  I  look  for-
ward  to  really  diving  into  these  issues.  I  know  we  have  a  lot  of 
challenges, and I just look forward to your leadership. 

And, Mr. Secretary-designee, thank you for being here today. It’s 

nice to meet you today. 

I  have,  really,  basically  two  questions.  One  is  about  broadband, 
specifically  about  broadband,  getting  broadband  out  into  rural 
America.  And,  of  course,  that  impacts  my  state  and  a  number  of 
other  states  here.  And  I’d  just  like  to  get  your  thoughts  on  any

plans  or  proposals  or  ideas  you  have  to  try  to  get  broadband  out

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Inouye,  I  am  delighted  to  be  joining  the  Commerce  Com-
mittee  and  look  forward  to  working  with  my  colleagues.  Mr.  Gutierrez,  good  after-
noon, I am pleased to meet you. 

This  is  truly  a  Committee  that  impacts  much  of  Arkansas  as  well  as  the  Nation. 
In  that  light,  I  wanted  to  take  a  moment  to  highlight  for  the  Committee—and  for 
Mr  Gutierrez—some  key  areas  within  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  that  are 
important to Arkansas. 
International Trade Administration 

Arkansas is home to a diverse and vibrant business community, one that depends 
on  fair  and  transparent  trade  laws.  From  Wal-Mart,  to  Tyson  Food,  Riceland  Rice, 
Producer’s  Rice  Mill,  Stevens,  Aciom  or  Nucor  Steel,  Arkansans  care  about  inter-
national trade and the actions of the International Trade Administration. 

Arkansans  welcome  fair  competition.  Arkansans  also  expect  trade  rules  to  be 
transparent  and  for  all  countries  to  play  by  the  rules.  During  times  of  economic 
struggles for much of the globe, this goal can be very difficult. 

I  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Committee  and  you,  Mr.  Gutierrez,  in 
strengthening the international trade and investment position of the United States. 
Minority Business Development Agency 

I am also keenly devoted to minority business development and, therefore, I hope 
to  work  with  you  on  empowering  the  Minority  Business  Development  Agency.  I  ex-
tend  the  offer  to  my  colleagues  and  to  you,  Mr.  Gutierrez,  to  join  me  in  Arkansas 
and  meet  with  the  many  industrious  men  and  women  from  our  African-American 
and Hispanic communities who could be our next generation of great entrepreneurs 
but are daunted by economic disadvantages. 

Mr.  Gutierrez,  Arkansas  has  a  population  consisting  of  15.58  percent  African-
Americans  and  3.25  percent  Hispanics.  The  growth  rate  in  the  Arkansas  Hispanic 
population is the second highest in the country. 

We must ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to reach their full poten-

tial and I urge you to join me in reaching out to these communities. 
Economic Development Administration 

I  am  a  strong  supporter  of  the  Economic  Development  Administration  (EDA). 
EDA  has  provided  essential  assistance  to  economically  distressed  communities  in 
Arkansas, especially in the Delta. EDA is an important tool to ensure that the vast 
wealth of this great nation provides opportunities for all. 
Technology Administration 

With  regard  to  the  Department  of  Commerce’s  Technology  Administration,  you 
might  be  interested  to  learn  that  Arkansas  is  at  the  forefront  of  important  techno-
logical  advancement  for  enhanced  commercialization, 
logistics  and 
nanotechnology. 

The  University  of  Arkansas  and  Arkansas  State  University  have  developed  and 
continue to work on initiatives that support real commerce opportunities for Arkan-
sas businesses such as agriculture, oil, timber, cotton and advanced manufacturing. 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration 

including 

Finally,  the  National  Telecommunications  and  Information  Administration  has 
and will continue to change the landscape of Arkansas. Arkansas has a strong tele-
communications industry. If fact, ALLTEL Corporation, an integrated telecommuni-
cations provider with almost 13 million consumers and over $8 billion in annual rev-
enues, is headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas. 

The future of telecommunications could offer vast opportunities for rural America 
and  especially  its  children.  We  must  do  more  to  provide  broadband  to  our  smaller 
communities  at  a  reasonable  cost.  We  must  do  more  to  ensure  that  the  benefits  of 
telecommunications are within reach of more of our population. 

Thank  you  for  this  time  to  speak  Mr.  Chairman.  I  look  forward  to  working  with 

you and the other Committee members.

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, Senator Pryor, thank you.

I hope to have a lot more knowledge of the subject, if confirmed, 
and  elaborate  a  little  bit  more  in  the  future.  My  understanding  is 
that  the  President  has  set  a  goal  to  provide  accessible  and  afford-
able  broadband  for  all  Americans,  and,  of  course,  including  rural 
America,  which  is  an  important  objective.  I  think  that  is  a  very 
powerful  goal,  both  on  a  global  scale,  competitively  for  the  nation, 
and  it’s  one  that  I—it’s  one  that  I  totally  endorse  and  totally  sup-
port, sir. 

Senator PRYOR. Great. And the second question I have, again, re-
lates  to  one  of  the  President’s  policies—and  one  of  your  prede-
cessor, Don Evans, policies—about the steel industry. There’s been 
a steel monitoring—import monitoring program in place since 2002. 
In  December  of  2003,  President  Bush  made  the  determination  to 
extend that program—along with Secretary Evans. But, as I under-
stand  it,  as  of  today,  the  Commerce  Department  has  not  adopted 
regulations  to  extend  the  program.  And  I  don’t  know  if  you’re  fa-
miliar  with  that,  but  I’d  ask  you  to  please  look  into  it.  And  that’s 
an  important  industry  to  a  lot  of  different  states  in  the  United 
States, but I think it’s an important industry to the American econ-
omy. Do you know anything about that? 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Not  enough,  as  I  should,  Senator  Pryor.  I  have 
not  been  involved  in  the  budgetary  process.  I  will  do  so,  if  con-
firmed. And I know that is important to you; I know it’s important 
to many Members of the Committee. That was a program that was 
mentioned  to  me  quite  frequently  during  the  courtesy  visit.  So  I 
will  definitely  keep  that  in  mind  and  remember  your  commitment 
to that, as well. 

Senator PRYOR. Great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
We  have  enough  people  here—if  you  listen  to  me  just  a  minute, 

will you please? 

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Based  on  the  fact  that  we  will  be  confirmed  by 
the time we vote on this nomination on the floor, and we will vote 
off  the  floor  on  reporting  the  nominee,  I  want  to  put  in  the  record 
now  a  motion  that  the  Secretary—that  the  nomination  be  rec-
ommended  to  the  floor  for  confirmation.  We  will  vote  on  that  after 
the first vote on the floor. Is there objection? 

Senator SMITH. Is that tomorrow? 
The CHAIRMAN. I believe it will be tomorrow. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Mr. Chairman? 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes. 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  I  have  a  whole  series  of  written  ques-
tions,  which  I  wish  to  submit,  as  well  as  the  ones  that  I’ll  ask 
today.  And  I  didn’t  know  that  this  was  going  to  happen,  until  last 
night. And, you know, people who have not been sworn in as Com-
mittee  Members,  or  whatever,  the—approved  by  the  Senate  as 
Committee  Members—can’t  vote.  I  suppose  that’ll  happen  tomor-
row,  but  I  doubt  that  I’ll  get  the  answers  to  my  questions  tomor-
row,  and  I’ve  never  been  through  a  hearing,  that  I  can  remember, 
where  I’ve  voted  in  favor  of  somebody  who  hasn’t  responded  to 
written questions. And so, my approach would be that I would have 
to vote no in Committee, if you’re going to do that today, and then

hopefully  wait  until  the  Secretary-designate  answered  the  ques-
tions. 

I mean, I’m a United States Senator. I represent the people from 
West  Virginia.  I  have  a  right  to  get  the  answers  to  my  questions. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator is correct. I asked if there’s any ob-
jection.  You’ve  objected.  I’ll  withdraw  the  request.  We’ll  take  care 
of it at the proper time. 

As  for  the  qualifications,  they  will  be  qualified  by  the  time  they 
vote.  As  for  your  questions,  we  intend  to  vote  on  this  on  January 
20th. And it’s my understanding that we’ll not be here after Friday, 
and  the  first  time  we’ll  be  back  will  be  January  20th.  I  hope  you 
get  your  questions  by  that  time,  because  we’ll  vote  after  the  first 
vote on the floor. I will make the motion at that time. 

I Recognize Senator Smith. 

STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH,

U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Senator SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Gutierrez, it’s a pleasure to see you here. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator  SMITH.  I  enjoyed  our  visit.  I  want  to  re-emphasize  what 
I  told  you  in  private—is  that,  before  this  job  is  over  for  you,  you 
will know more about fish than cornflakes. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator SMITH. And I look forward to working with you on those 

issues. 

As you’re aware, I think, from our conversation, the largest trade 
case in American history is between the United States and Canada 
on the soft wood lumber issue. Currently, the Department of Com-
merce  is  collecting  duties  on  that.  I’m  hoping  that  you  will  tell  me 
that  those  duties  will  not  be  surrendered  until  they  are  part  of  a 
negotiated settlement. And that is very important in my part of the 
world. Do you have a position on that, at this point? 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Senator,  I—just  in  deference  of  this  Committee 
and  yourself,  I  would  like  to  commit  to  things  that  I  know  I  can 
deliver  on,  and  I’d  like  to  delve  into  this  matter  a  little  bit  before 
expressing  any  commitment.  I  do  know  that  the  lumber  issue  is 
one  that  has  come  up.  You  are  very  strong  on  it.  I  believe  just 
about  every  Member  of  the  Committee  was  very  forceful  on  this 
issue.  It  is  a  serious  matter.  It’s  been  lingering  for  quite  awhile, 
and it is something that I will definitely pursue. 

Senator  SMITH.  It’s  very  important,  and  it’s  in  the  interest  of 
Canada  and  the  United  States  that  we  negotiate  a  settlement  so 
that  this  industry,  on  both  sides  of  the  border,  can  survive.  And 
these  duties  that  are  being  collected  are  an  important—a  very  im-
portant part of that negotiated settlement. 

On the issue of piracy, Mr. Gutierrez, America’s copyright indus-
try  generates  some  12  percent  of  American  GDP,  and  account  for 
over  8  percent  of  the  total  U.S.  employment.  Specifically,  the  four 
copyright  categories  are  movies,  music,  publishing,  and  software—
computer  software.  They  account  for  over  $90  billion  in  foreign 
sales  and  exports—more  than  agriculture,  more  than  automobiles, 
and more than aircraft. And there are just untold numbers of peo-
ple  whose  jobs  are  in  jeopardy  because  of  the  amount  of  theft  that 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  09:43 Nov 14, 2005 Jkt 022734 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22734.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

15

is  occurring  overseas  on  American  copyrighted  materials.  And  so, 
I don’t know if you have a comment on that, but I raise this issue, 
because I think it’s so important to highlight to the Department of 
Commerce  that  we  vigorously  pursue  piracy  issues,  specifically 
with  China,  specifically  with  Russia,  where  we  have  lost  billions. 
Pretty soon our entertainers are going to be on street corners with 
monkey-grinders, trying to get people to pay them. But, ultimately, 
if we lose copyright issues, we’re going to lose a great and valuable 
part of the American economy. 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Senator,  I  agree.  And  I  agree  with  the  passion 
with  which  you  state  the  problem.  We  actually  lived  through  this, 
as  a  food  company,  ironically,  where  we  had—we  found  that  our 
brand was actually being copied and used in some markets, and ob-
viously without any authorization. And one of the great assets that 
we have as a country are our brands, our technology. 

So  I  agree,  I  think  this  is  a  matter  to  focus  on.  I  think  it  is  a 
big  issue,  and  I  know  it’s  a  matter  of  great  concern  to  you,  as  it 
is for me, Senator. 

Senator  SMITH.  Finally,  Mr.  Chairman—Mr.  Gutierrez,  I  under-
stand  that  China  is  on  the  verge  of  releasing  government  procure-
ment regulations for China that will have the effect of barring most 
U.S.  soft-wood  products  from  being  sold  in  China.  I  don’t  know  if 
you’re  aware  of  that.  I  want  to  make  you  aware  of  that.  It’s  obvi-
ously  an  issue  of  real  importance  to  timber  workers  in  the  State 
of  Oregon.  So,  I  don’t  know  if  you’ve  heard  of  it,  or  will  focus  on 
it, but I sure hope you will. 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Senator,  I  will  focus  on  it.  I  know  it’s  of  impor-

tance to you and the Committee, and I will focus on that. 

Senator  SMITH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  If  I  may,  for  the 

record, I’ll put my opening statement in the record. 

The CHAIRMAN. Without objection. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Smith follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GORDON H. SMITH, U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Thank you Mr. Chairman. I want to first congratulate you on your election as our 
new Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. I look forward to working with 
you and all our colleagues on the many difficult issues the Committee will be tack-
ling this year. 

Mr.  Gutierrez,  I  want  to  welcome  you  to  today’s  confirmation  hearing  and  want 
to  congratulate  you  for  being  nominated  as  our  next  Secretary  of  Commerce.  Your 
success  story  will  continue  to  be  an  encouragement  to  many  young  entrepreneurs 
in America. I would like to invite you to Oregon to see the new and emerging tech-
nologies  in  my  state.  Oregon  continues  to  have  economic  development  needs  and, 
unfortunately, leads the country in unemployment. 

On  a  more  specific  issue,  it  is  my  understanding  that  Oregon  has  not  been  able 
to  receive  any  assistance  from  the  Minority  Business  Development  Agency  for  at 
least  10  years  because  the  agency  has  focused  its  efforts  primarily  on  larger  states 
and  cities.  I  would  like  to  ask  for  your  assistance  to  investigate  this  issue  at  the 
MBDA,  so  that  all  minority-owned  businesses  can  benefit  from  this  agency.  I  look 
forward  to  working  with  you  to  develop  and  coordinate  policies  that  will  provide 
spur growth and jobs for our nation. 

On  the  issue  relating  to  the  wake  of  the  recent  tsunami,  we  continue  to  mourn 
the  enormous  loss  of  life  in  southeast  Asia.  As  policymakers,  we  must  look  for  les-
sons  we  can  learn  from  this  tragedy  and  what  steps  we  can  take  to  help  prevent 
such  devastation  should  a  similar  event  occur  in  the  future.  I  have  no  doubt  that 
in  the  coming  months  and  years  this  panel  will  spend  a  great  deal  of  time  evalu-
ating  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  our  current  ocean  monitoring  and  research 
systems.  As  a  Senator  from  a  coastal  state,  I  have  a  very  obvious  and  personal  in-

terest  in  this  debate.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you,  the  Administration,  and 
those in our coastal communities to address these and other issues. 

Mr.  Gutierrez,  thank  you  for  your  appearance  today.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.

The CHAIRMAN. Next, I’ll recognize Senator Lautenberg. 
STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  welcome, 

Mr. Gutierrez. 

You’re  here  at  a  historic  moment,  not  only  for  you,  but  for  this 
Committee,  as  well,  because  it  is  a—I  don’t  want  to  use  the  term 
‘‘reformed’’—restructured  Committee.  And  I  welcome  our  new  col-
leagues,  not  as  joyously  as  I  might  have  had  if  they  were  sitting 
on this side of the aisle——

[Laughter.] 
Senator LAUTENBERG.—but, nevertheless, I look forward to work-

ing with you. 

And,  Mr.  Gutierrez,  I  would  think  that  you’d  have  to  note  that 
Senator  Inouye,  Senator  Stevens,  and  I  are  among  the  more  ma-
ture  Members  here,  and  we,  the  three  of  us,  served  in  World  War 
II.  We  are,  I  think,  the  last  ones  to  have  been  active  during  the 
period  in  the—in  this  Senate.  And,  therefore,  you  have  some  idea 
of our age; we’re all over 60. And——

[Laughter.] 
Senator LAUTENBERG. I hear a snicker go through the crowd. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator LAUTENBERG. But——
The CHAIRMAN. For some of us, it’s not that apparent. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well,  you  know  why,  Mr.  Gutierrez.  It’s 

that Special K and Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator LAUTENBERG. That’s what did it. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator LOTT. Salmon is what did it. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Oh, salmon, I’m sorry. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  And  if  we  continue  like  this,  we’ll  never 

get to talk about the serious subject. 

But we do welcome you and really look at your history as a quin-
tessential  American  story.  And  it’s  wonderful  to  be  repeated.  In 
many  instances  through  this  body,  we’ve  met  people  who  simi-
larly—I  was  born  of  immigrant  parents,  and  had  a  fortunate  and 
somewhat  lucky  business  career  before  coming  here,  so  I  respect 
greatly  what  you’ve  accomplished,  from  the—where  you  started  to 
where you are today. And we’re going to look to you, Mr. Gutierrez, 
for  a  response  that  I  noted  in  your  comments,  and  that  was  that 
you hoped to bridge the boundaries, and you included, in there, po-
litical,  economic,  et  cetera.  And  I  urge  you  to  do  that.  We  some-
times have disagreements that ought to be able to be dealt with in 
a more comprehensive fashion, and I hope that you’ll help us. 

This  department,  this  Committee,  has  an  enormous  array  of 
items  that  we  work  with,  and  you’ll  have  a  chance  to  hear  about

them  and  learn  about  them,  and  going  from  the  communications 
side  to  the  marine  side  to  the  trade  and  business  side.  And  when 
I  look  at  where  we  are,  Mr.  Gutierrez,  I  don’t  understand  what  it 
is that has us with a dollar that’s so cheap compared to other cur-
rencies.  And  yet,  our  trade  balance  is  still  in  the  negative  column. 
What  has  to  happen  with  our  products  that  are  sold  at  these  very 
relatively  low  prices  and  still  don’t  enable  us  to  gain  a  favorable 
trade balance? 

So those are among the things that—and, Mr. Chairman, I would 

ask that my full statement be included in the record. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Lautenberg follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Mr. Chairman: 
I  want  to  commend  our  outgoing  Chairman,  Senator  McCain,  and  congratulate 
him for the Committee’s accomplishments during his tenure. I think I can speak for 
all of the Committee Members on this side of the dais when I say that he has been 
very fair to the minority. 

I also want to note how much we will miss Senator Hollings. 
And  I  want  to  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  our  incoming  Chairman  and 
Ranking  Member,  Senator  Stevens  and  Senator  Inouye.  The  Committee  will  be  in 
good  hands  with  these  two  men  at  the  helm.  Between  them,  they  have  nearly  80 
years of Senate service. 

Today’s hearing is on the nomination of Carlos Gutierrez to be Secretary of Com-
merce. I welcome the nominee and look forward to hearing his views on how he will 
promote American business interests in a way that creates jobs. There are still fewer 
jobs today than there were four years ago; meanwhile, the labor force keeps getting 
bigger. 

Mr.  Gutierrez’s  story  is  an  inspirational  one—he  came  to  America  as  a  six-year 
old immigrant from Cuba, he worked hard, and he became the CEO of a well-known 
American company, Kellogg, at the age of 45. 

Mr.  Gutierrez,  your  story  is  the  quintessential  ‘‘American  Dream.’’  I  know  about 
the American Dream because I have lived it, too. My parents arrived here as immi-
grants and I was able to rise to the top of the business world as you have, so I can 
appreciate your success. 

Mr. Gutierrez, at the outset, let me alert you of my concern over this administra-
tion’s  budget  and  trade  policies.  We  are  currently  running  the  biggest  budget  and 
trade  deficits  in  history.  We  need  to  borrow  2.5  billion  dollars  from  foreign  sources 
each  and  every  day  to  finance  our  current  consumption.  As  a  businessman,  you 
should know that’s just not sustainable. 

I  also  want  to  apprise  you  of  my  strong  support  of  the  Manufacturing  Extension 
Program  (MEP),  which  helps  thousands  of  small  manufacturers  to  increase  their 
productivity and create and retain high-skilled American jobs. 

In Fiscal Year 2003, because of the assistance they received, MEP clients:
• saved 681 million dollars in operating/production costs; 
• invested 940 million dollars in new plant and equipment; 
• retained or created 35,000 jobs; and 
• reported sales of 1.84 billion dollars.
I  hope  that  you  will  work  to  preserve  Commerce  Department  programs  like  the 

Manufacturing Extension Program. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  And  I  would  just  ask  this  one  question  of 
Mr.  Gutierrez,  and  that  is,  If  the  dollar  continues  to  fall,  would  it 
be  your  view  that  it’s  either  good  or  bad  for  the  economy?  What 
would your perspective be, sir? 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Senator, thank you. 
Senator,  I  have  a  lot  to  learn  about  Washington  and  about  how 
our  business  is  conducted  here.  One  thing  I  have  learned  is  that 
the  only  two  people  who  speak  on  behalf  of  the  currency,  or  about

the  currency,  are  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  and  the  President. 
So  if  you’ll  forgive  me,  I  will  refrain  from  answering  that  specifi-
cally. I would hate to get myself in trouble before I even start this 
mission, sir. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Think about it. The question——
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, sir. 
Senator LAUTENBERG.—could come up again. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you——
[Laughter.] 
Senator LAUTENBERG.—very much, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Well, thank you very much. 
We will now recognize Senator Vitter. 

STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID VITTER,

U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA 

Senator  VITTER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Ranking  Mem-

ber, and thank you for the warm welcome to the Committee. 

Mr. Gutierrez, good to have you, and congratulations on a splen-

did career, as well as your appointment. 

I  have  just  a  couple  of  quick  areas  of  interest.  One  of  them  is 
trade.  I’m  a  strong  supporter  of  free  and  fair  trade.  In  a  lot  of 
cases,  a  lot  of  trade  cases,  I  think  the  great  frustration  among  a 
lot  of  Americans  is  that  we  don’t  have  reasonable  or  quick-enough 
relief when there are trade violations by our trading partners. And 
so,  even  when  we  have  a  trade  agreement,  when  the  other  side 
breaks  the  rules,  they  often  do  it  with  relative  impunity,  at  least 
for  a  good  amount  of  time.  And  for  a  lot  of  small  business,  justice 
delayed  is  justice  denied.  Louisiana,  I’m  thinking  of  seafood, 
shrimp, and crayfish, and some other things. 

What  can  we  do,  both  with  our  bureaucracy  and  the  inter-
national bureaucracy, so we can respond more effectively and more 
quickly to trade violations? 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Senator Vitter, this is something that I have had 
brief  discussions  on,  and  it  concerns  me,  as  well.  As  someone  who 
does business in a way where we like to follow the rules, it is some-
times  extremely  frustrating  when  we  find  that  our  partners  over-
seas  aren’t  following  the  same  rules.  I  share  that  sentiment.  And 
if  there’s  something  that  we  can  do  in  terms  of  speed,  something 
that we can do in terms of being more efficient and effective about 
that,  please  be  assured  that  that  will  be  high  on  my  agenda,  Sen-
ator. 

Senator VITTER. Well, great. 
Let  me  mention  a  couple  of  examples  that  are,  again,  important 

to Louisiana. I——

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, sir. 
Senator VITTER.—mentioned crayfish. There are tariffs on certain 
foreign crayfish. One of the problems has been that, within our own 
bureaucracy,  the  rate  of  properly  imposing  those  is  under  20  per-
cent;  whereas,  the  overall  rate,  in  terms  of  proper  tariff  enforce-
ment  by  our  own  people—I’m  talking  about  our  government—is 
over 95 percent. And we’ve been pushing and pushing and pushing 
Customs  and  others  to  get  our  act  together  to  fix  that.  So  I’d  com-
mend that to you.

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, sir. 
Senator  VITTER.  Also,  another  case  affects  Louisiana’s  shrimp. 
There  have  been  recent  decisions  that  have  confirmed  that  there’s 
dumping—illegal  dumping  of  foreign  shrimp,  and  we’re  moving  to 
respond to that. But, again, some of this process takes so long that 
if  you’re  a  small  business,  which  every  Louisiana  shrimper  is,  it 
doesn’t matter if it happens 5 years from now. It’s too late. It’s way 
too late. So I’d commend that situation——

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, sir. 
Senator VITTER.—to you, too. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, Senator, thank you. 
Senator  VITTER.  I’d  also  like  to  touch  on  NOAA,  which  is  very 
important  to  my  part  of  the  world,  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  I’m  a 
strong  supporter  of  NOAA,  and  it  does  a  lot  of  important  things, 
including pure science and research, but it also does some very ap-
plied  things,  which  are  important,  like  survey  work  in  Alaska,  in 
the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  elsewhere.  I’m  a  big  supporter  of  making  sure 
we  get  that  survey  work  done,  because  it’s  not  several  steps  re-
moved from commerce; it is directly related to commerce, certainly 
in  the  Gulf.  And  I’d  just  like  your  reaction  to  that,  and  your 
thoughts on that end of, sort of, the NOAA spectrum of work. 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Well,  NOAA,  from  what  I  have  seen,  is  a  tre-
mendous  part  of  the  budget  of  the  Commerce  Department.  It  is  a 
big  part  of  what  we  do,  and  it  is  something  that  is  a  priority  be-
cause  it  is  a  priority  for  this  Committee,  because  it  is  right,  and 
because it is something with which the Commerce Department has 
been  charged.  So  I  can’t  claim  to  be  an  expert  on  NOAA,  Senator, 
but  I  can  promise  you  that  this  is  going  to  be  one  of  my  biggest 
areas of focus. 

Senator VITTER. Great. Well, I appreciate that. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. It has to be. And I——
Senator  VITTER.  And  I’d  offer  two  thoughts.  One  is  that,  in  the 
NOAA  scheme  of  things,  my  observation  is  that  the  pure-science 
end is often the, sort of, ‘‘sexy’’ end that gets attention and money, 
and  the  applied  end  sometimes  gets  short  shrift.  And  that  is  often 
the  end  that  has  the  most  immediate  impact  on  commerce.  And 
things  like  routine  updating  of  surveys  of  the  Gulf  and  the  waters 
off Alaska and elsewhere is very important for maritime commerce. 
Also,  I’m  a  strong  supporter  of  getting  the  most  bang  for  the 
buck for that sort of work, however the chips may fall, whether it’s 
a  government-owned  vessel  or  whether  it’s  contracting  out  to  pri-
vate  firms.  And  I  would  encourage  you  to  use  no  test,  other  than 
what  is  going  to  get  the  taxpayer  the  most  bang  for  the  buck.  In 
survey  work,  it’s  pretty  simple,  in  terms  of,  you  know,  How  much 
surveying  are  you  going  to  be  able  to  do  for  X  amount  of  dollars? 
And I hope we can do that, in the future. 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Thank  you.  I  appreciate  the  pragmatism,  Sen-

ator, and I will definitely keep that in mind. 

I also want to say, I think it’s very insightful, the comment about 
small  businesses,  that  they  are  in  a  hurry,  they  do  want  to  get 
their  matters  solved.  They  are  worried  about  cash-flow.  They  can’t 
wait  as  long  as  sometimes  we’d  like  them  to.  And  I  understand 
that  urgency,  and  I  understand  that  that  is  the  reality  that  they

live. So I just want to say, I agree with that, and I share that con-
cern. 

Senator VITTER. Thank you. And that also translates, ultimately, 
into  how  much  political  support  we  have  for  trade,  because  if  we 
don’t have reasonable enforcement in a reasonable amount of time, 
and small business is hurt every step of the way, obviously——

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Right. 
Senator VITTER.—that erodes support for the whole policy.

STATEMENT OF HON. JIM DEMINT,

U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA 

Senator  DEMINT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I,  too,  am  ap-
preciative  of  the  warm  welcome.  I’m  honored  to  serve  on  the  Com-
mittee. As you know, my predecessor, Senator Hollings, from South 
Carolina,  served  many  years,  and  I  don’t  know  if  I  can  serve  as 
many, but I look forward to serving with all of you. 

As  I  understand  the  protocol  from  your  opening  statement,  you 
have  to  still  approve  me  as  a—or  confirm  me  as  a  Member  before 
we  confirm  you  as  Chairman  before  we  confirm  Mr.  Gutierrez——

[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. You’ve got that right, but it will all happen after 

the first vote. 

Senator DEMINT. OK, good deal. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator DEMINT. All right. Well, we can still ask questions. 
And  I  want  to  thank  Mr.  Gutierrez  for  being  here,  being  willing 
to serve. And I liked a lot of the things you said, particularly about 
fostering  a  better  business  environment  in  this  country.  As  I  visit 
businesses  all  over  the  country,  particularly  in  South  Carolina,  I 
hear  more  and  more  about  the  burden  of  costs  and  regulation  and 
taxes  and  liability  that  comes  from  being  a  U.S.-based  manufac-
turer,  particularly.  And  as  a  producer,  yourself,  for  many  years, 
doing business internationally, I’d just like to hear you talk a little 
bit  about  how  we  can  make  American  business  more  competitive, 
and  cut  the  costs  of  doing  business  in  this  country,  and  make  this 
the  best  place  in  the  world  to  do  business.  And  I’m  sure,  in  your 
role  at  Kellogg,  many  times  you’ve  said,  ‘‘If  I  was  in  Washington, 
this is what I would do, this is what I would change.’’ And I’d just 
love to hear you just talk a few minutes, generally, about what you 
think we need to focus on here in the Senate, in the Congress, the 
President,  and  what  you  would  do,  in  the  Department  of  Com-
merce, to make America the best place in the world to do business. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator. 
I  would  say,  first  of  all,  that  throughout  the  last  century,  I  be-
lieve,  American  business  has  led  the  way,  and  it  has  done  so 
through,  I  think,  the  spirit  of  free  enterprise,  innovation,  invest-
ment, just being able to be the engine for growth around the world. 
I  understand  the  need  for  regulation.  And  as  a  businessperson,  I 
understood the need for certain regulations that, perhaps, were not 
evident or were not in place. I think we have to be careful that we 
do  not  make  business  risk  almost  a  liability,  or  business  risk  al-

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  09:43 Nov 14, 2005 Jkt 022734 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22734.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

most a crime. I think what has driven our economy is, over time—
our  country—is  the  idea  that  someone  can  take  a  risk,  they  can 
have  an  idea,  and  they  can  strive  and  dream  to  make  their  busi-
ness larger and prosperous. 

And  we  do  have  to  be  careful.  Sitting  on  the  other  side,  it  is—
it  can  become  a  point  where  businesspeople  become  a  little  bit 
paranoid,  where  businesspeople  become  a  little  fearful  to  do  their 
job.  And  that  notion  frightens  me,  just  the  idea  that  we  are  not 
promoting  risk-taking,  we  are  not  promoting  innovation,  entrepre-
neurship in the future. And I’m not suggesting that that is the case 
today,  but  that  is  a  notion  that  does  give  me  some  nightmares 
sometimes, Senator. 

Senator  DEMINT.  And  if  I  could  just  echo  some  of  the  things 
we’ve heard, as far as trade, I’m from a textile-producing state. I’m 
very  much  a  free-trader  myself.  But  the  political  support  and  just 
the pragmatism of trade really only exists if we’re going to enforce 
our  agreements,  if  we’re  going  to  protect  our  copyrights  and  our 
patents.  And  I  think  if  there’s  one  thing  we  need  from  the  Com-
merce  Department  more  than  anything  else,  is  a  level,  balanced 
playing  field  around  the  world,  and  just  good  enforcement,  so  we 
can do business everywhere in the world with—and on a fair basis. 
So I would hope that would be a priority of yours. 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Yes,  sir,  it  is.  And  I  share  that  same  concern. 
And  it  is  an  evolutionary  process,  and  I  think  every  time  we  have 
an  agreement,  every  time  we  have  a  new  agreement  with  a  coun-
try,  or  with  a  set  of  countries,  it  is  an  opportunity  to  evolve,  to 
make  progress  toward  the  kind  of  world  we’d  like  to  see.  But  I 
share your concern. I think the rest of the world has to understand 
what  ‘‘fair  and  free  trade’’  means  to  us.  And  I  am  as  concerned  as 
you are, Senator. 

Senator DEMINT. Yes. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you. 
Senator DEMINT. Thank you, sir. And thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

I yield back. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
I Recognize Senator Dorgan. 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you. 
Mr.  Gutierrez,  thank  you  very  much.  I  have,  kind  of,  a  foghorn 

voice today. Excuse me for that. 

You have a very compelling life story, and I’m really pleased that 

you’re willing to provide public service to your country. 

Unless  I  hear  something  startling  from  you,  it’s  my  expectation 
I  will  support  your  nomination.  But  I  am  going  to  precede  your 
nomination  vote  on  the  floor  with  about  a  1-hour  speech  on  trade, 
and I’m only going to ask you about trade today. 

You  began  your  statement  with  trade.  And  the  reason  I’m  only 
going  to  ask  you  about  trade  is,  I  think  we  have  a  growing  and 
dangerous  trade  deficit.  And  it’s  not  just  this  Administration,  al-
though—I  mean,  it  started  15,  20  years  ago.  It  has  grown  and 
grown and grown. It’s the highest in the history of the world. It is 
dangerous.  And  this  Congress  and  this  Administration,  and  pre-

22

vious Administrations, seem willing to snore through it by chanting 
about free trade. 

Let me show you a chart that shows the red ink on trade deficits. 
I  mean,  you  don’t  need  a  lot  of  understanding  to  understand  that 
bar  chart.  These  trade  deficits  are  dramatic  and,  I  think,  reckless 
and dangerous. 

Now, let me ask you about a couple of specific things. First of all, 

I have to ask you about sugar, as you might well expect. 

You  were  CEO  of  an  excellent  company,  but  you  lobbied  very 
hard  in  Congress  to  kill  the  sugar  program,  with  that  company. 
And  the  Mexico  Economy  Minister,  Fernando  Canales,  has  said 
that  you  and  he  have  spoken  about  the  sweetener  dispute  in 
NAFTA,  and  that  you  and  he  have  established  a  work  plan  for 
when you take office. Obviously, I have a lot of constituents—prob-
ably  Mr.  Vitter  does,  as  well,  and  some  others—about  the  sugar 
program, who are concerned about the sugar program. I don’t know 
whether  you  will  have  decision  points  in  the  Commerce  Depart-
ment  on  this  issue,  but,  if  you  do,  how  will  you  deal  with  them? 
Will  you  recuse  yourself  on  those  issues?  Do  you  intend—some 
have  suggested  that  you  will  come  to  Washington  to  lobby  to  kill 
the sugar program. That was in a couple of press reports. Give me 
your assessment of what all that is. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Senator, thank you. 
A couple of things on the sugar program. And I should say that, 
as a manufacturer and business which relies on sugar, I had to see 
the  world  in  a  certain  way,  I  was  paid  to  do  that,  that  was  in  the 
best interest of the owners of the company. But I fully understand 
that the scope of my responsibilities will be a lot greater than just 
having  one  set  of  share  owners  who  are  interested  in  the  price  of 
sugar.  So,  I  fully  recognize  that  I  would  have  to  expand  my  scope 
and realize that I am no longer the Chairman and CEO of the Kel-
logg Company, but the Commerce Secretary. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Have  you  determined  whether  you  would 
recuse  yourself  on  sugar  issues  if,  in  fact,  you  had  a  decision-
making authority there? 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Senator, if it is deemed, for the purpose of ethics 
or even optics, that I not participate, and this Committee feels that 
way, I would be very comfortable in recusing myself. I believe I can 
be  very  objective.  I  believe  I  can  avoid  the  conflict,  but  I’d  be  will-
ing to do so, sir, if that’s the——

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Gutierrez, thank you. 
On  another  issue,  then—Senator  Ashcroft  and  I  passed  a  piece 
of  legislation,  that  has  become  law,  that  allows,  for  the  first  time 
in  40-some  years,  us  to  sell  agricultural  products  into  the  Cuban 
marketplace for cash. We have sold nearly $1 billion worth of agri-
cultural  products  to  Cuba  for  cash.  The  Department  of  the  Treas-
ury is now taking an exceptional and unusual interpretation of the 
language  of  the  law,  and  trying  to  do  everything  they  can  to  im-
pede  and  stop  the  legitimate  sale,  under  current  law,  of  agricul-
tural commodities to Cuba. You and I spoke about that just briefly. 
You  talked  about  wanting  to  reduce  the  barriers  and  burdens  of 
our  ability  to  sell  overseas.  Would  that  include  in  the  market  of 
Cuba, since it is now legal?

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Senator,  you  mentioned  this  during  our  visit, 
and  I  understand  you  feel  very  strongly  about  this.  I  am  aware  of 
the  subject  of  the  payment  or  the  cash  in  advance,  and  the  inter-
pretation  of  that.  I  know  that  is  a  matter  to  be  resolved  by  the 
Treasury  Department.  I  have  not  gotten  into  that,  obviously.  But 
I  understand  that  you  are  worried  about  that  and  you  think  that 
that is a different interpretation than what it should be. And I will 
certainly look into that. 

I  should  say,  Senator,  as  well,  as  I  mentioned  to  you,  I  support 
the President’s policy on Cuba. I’m very concerned about doing any-
thing that would prolong the current status. And, most of all, I be-
lieve  very  firmly  in  the  objective  of  bringing  democracy  to  Cuba, 
which I know is what drives the policy. 

But  I  know  where  you  stand,  and  I  know  your  concern  on  the 
payments  issue,  and  I  will  look  into  that.  And  I  would  be  glad  to 
discuss  that  in  the  future,  although,  from  a  Commerce  standpoint, 
that is a little bit outside our purview. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Well,  I  see  my  time  is  about  up.  I’ll  stay  for  a 
second  round,  I  guess.  But  let  me  just  ask  one  other  question,  if 
I might, under the yellow light. 

There  are  proposals  by  the  USTR,  that  we  would  be  willing  to 
negotiate  away  our  anti-dumping  provisions.  I’m  very  concerned 
about  trade  remedies.  We  don’t  have  the  backbone  or  the  will  or 
the  steel  to  employ  them  hardly  at  all,  ever,  but  negotiating  them 
away  is  fundamentally  folly,  in  my  judgment,  for  this  country. 
What’s your position on that? 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Well, I think we absolutely need—remedies, and 
trade  agreements  without  some  sort  of  remedy,  without  some  sort 
of  course  of  action,  would  make  them  somewhat  feeble.  So  I  share 
the  concern  and  the  belief  that  we  need  a  way  to  enforce  our  laws 
in a way that our partners understand. 

Senator, may I go—I’m sorry, I just wanted to address something 

you said earlier. 

I  did  receive  a  call  from  Mr.  Canales,  who,  I  believe,  would  be 
my counterpart in Mexico if I am confirmed and sworn in. I believe 
the  conversation  was  one  of,  ‘‘Look  forward  to  working  with  you. 
Thank  you  very  much.’’  But  I  can  assure  you  I  did  not  make  any 
commitments  on  behalf  of  the  Administration  or  the  U.S.  Govern-
ment,  knowing  that  I  have  not  been  confirmed  as  Secretary  of 
Commerce. 

Senator  DORGAN.  So  you  have  not  established  a  work  plan  with 

him, as he alleges. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. No, Senator. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator’s time has expired. 
Senator Rockefeller is recognized. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV,

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Gutierrez, I, also, very, very much admire—it was very inter-
esting the way the press just fastened right on the story of how you 
came  up  and  just  did  things  that  are  possible  in  America,  but 
which  rarely  happen.  And  you,  sort  of,  captivated  a  nation,  really, 
before anybody knew anything about you.

I’ve  spent  20  years  here  trying  to  convince  Byron  Dorgan  and 
others  that  I,  sort  of,  came  up  the  same  way,  but  I  haven’t  made 
much progress. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. But it does give me a chance to really pay 
honor  to  that.  I  mean,  that  is—that’s  very,  very—it’s  a  marvelous 
thing, an emotional, marvelous tribute to, obviously, a strong man. 
I  don’t  mean  to  hold  anything  up,  and  it  would—I  will  probably 
end  up  voting  for  you,  but  I  do  want  to  get  the  answers  to  some 
questions that I will submit to you, and they’re—and they won’t be, 
I  don’t  think,  particularly  difficult.  But  I  do  want  to  get  answers 
to  them,  because  they—I  come  from  the  State  of  West  Virginia, 
which is the second-poorest state in the country—I think I can say 
that safely. Can I, Mark? All right. 

And  steel—there’s  a  big  question  there—and  steel,  to  some  peo-
ple, is, kind of, a subject which has passed us by. I remember talk-
ing  with  a  former—member  of  a  former  Administration,  a  Demo-
cratic Administration, and I talked about the fact that free-trade—
I mean, you made mention that you’ve got to have good trade-rem-
edy  laws,  in  an  answer  to  Senator  Dorgan.  And  somehow,  free 
trade  and  free-trade  remedies  and  the  holding  on  to—not  weak-
ening the laws at Doha, et cetera, which our current USTR Ambas-
sador  promised  me,  and  then,  within  3  months,  was  giving  them 
away,  negotiating  them  away—that’s  very,  very  serious  in  West 
Virginia,  where  our  unemployment  is  very  high,  and  where  only  4 
percent of the land is flat, and where life is constantly hard. There 
are many rural states here, and that’s why you’re hearing about in-
dividual problems. There are very few, sort of, states that have all 
kinds of opportunities, economic opportunities. 

The  Doha  package  is  very  important  to  me,  and  I  want  to 
know—although—that  you  will  do  everything  in  your  power,  as 
Secretary of Commerce, which I think you will become, to not nego-
tiate any further trade-remedy laws away. We’re hurting. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, Senator. First of all, I’m——
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  I  understand  it’s  under  USTR,  but  you’ll 

be a part of that——

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER.—Cabinet. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, Senator. 
First  of  all,  I  just  want  to  recognize  the  seriousness  of  the  steel 
matter  and  the—and  acknowledge  the  importance  to  you  and  your 
state. And I—that is something that I was aware of, just as—read-
ing  the  papers  before  this  process  got  started.  And  it  worries  me, 
and  I  agree  with  you  that  steel  is  as  much  a  part  of  our  future  as 
it’s  been  part  of  our  past,  and  there  is  room  for  us  to  be  a  power 
in  steel,  and  to  continue  to  grow.  And  I  just  pledge  to  you,  sir,  to 
keep  your  concern  very  much  in  mind  and  do  what  I  can  to  make 
sure that our workers are protected. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  It’s  not  a  high-tech,  in  the  usual  sense—
you know, the Silicon Valley sense—but, oh, there are so many peo-
ple  that  work  for  it  for  generations,  and  then  they  come  out,  and 
their  retirement  is  gone,  their  pension  is  gone,  their  health  bene-
fits,  gone,  everything  is  gone.  And  that,  of  course,  is  the  point  of 
trade-adjustment  assistance.  And  when  that  was—when  some  of

these  changes  were  made,  in  2002,  the  Congress  passed  a  TAA, 
which—a  reform  act,  which  said  that  up  to  65  percent  of  the  cost 
of health insurance would be borne and available to the employees. 
Now,  what’s  interesting  is  that  only  6  percent  of  the  employees 
that  this  affects  have  taken  advantage  of  that,  which  is  shocking, 
in a sense, but it means that the 65 percent doesn’t do the job. And 
the  thinking,  generally  around  here  is,  it’s  got  to  be  95  percent  if 
it’s  going  to  do  the  job.  But  the  6  percent  thing,  I  wish  you  would 
look  into  why—why  is  it  so  little,  when  healthcare  costs—these,  of 
course,  are  much  older  people,  people  who  have  been  injured,  et 
cetera,  and  I  would  like  to  hear,  at  some  point,  your  thoughts  on 
that question. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. I will——
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  You  may  not  have  had  a  chance  to  study 

it yet. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ.—I will, Senator, as soon as I can, yes, sir. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. I appreciate that. 
Also—and  my  time  is  about  up—when  the  President  put  in  the 
existing  Steel  Import  Monitoring  Program,  there  was  a—that  was 
also,  at  the  same  time,  a  Section  201  pass,  which  was  temporary 
relief  for  steel.  And,  at  that  time,  Secretary  Evans,  your  prede-
cessor,  stated,  unequivocally,  that  the  existing  program  would  be 
expanded to additional steel products, and made indefinite in dura-
tion.  Now,  that  program  is  about  to  run  out,  in  fact;  it’s  about  to 
expire.  And  I  would  hope  that  you  would  commit  yourself,  to  the 
extent that you can, that this program would continue. 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Senator,  my  commitment  to  you  is  that  I  will 
give  it  the  attention  that  it  warrants,  and  I  will  heed  your  advice 
on that. And once I’ve had some time to even go through our budg-
et and where our funds are being allocated, I would like to get back 
to you and discuss that with you. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. I thank you very much, sir. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE ALLEN,

U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA 

Senator  ALLEN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I  welcome  our 
new Members to the Committee, and thank Mr. Gutierrez for being 
here, and, moreover, thank him for the service that he will be per-
forming for our country. It’s no easy task to be a Cabinet Secretary. 
Secretary of Commerce is an important position. So thank you and 
your  family  for  your  patriotism  and  your  service  and  leadership 
and insights you’ll be providing to us and, obviously, the President 
and, ultimately, benefiting the American people. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator  ALLEN.  I’m  one,  Mr.  Gutierrez,  that  believes  that  we 
need  to  do  everything  we  can  to  make  sure  that  this  country  is 
more  competitive,  more  desirable  for  investment  and  job  creation. 
That  means  our  tax  policies,  regulatory  policies,  research,  edu-
cation—all  need  to  make  sure  that  every  American  has  a  better 
ability to compete and succeed internationally. And so, many of the

issues  that  have  been  brought  up  here  by  some  of  my  colleagues 
are important in that regard. 

Trade  agreements  are  important,  but  they  need  to  be  enforced, 
So  I’m  glad  to  hear  your  comments.  It’ll  be  important  that  you 
work  with  our  trade  representatives  to  enforce  when  China  is 
cheating  in  a  variety  of  areas,  whether  it’s  intellectual  property, 
whether  that’s  software  or  other  matters,  furniture,  textiles,  or 
semiconductor chips. If we’re going to have trade agreements, those 
contracts  need  to  be  enforced,  and  enforced  quickly.  This  will  be 
necessary  if  we’re  going  to  continue  to  try  to  have  the  support  of 
the American people for trade agreements as a net-plus. 

Trade  adjustment  assistance  is  important,  understanding  that 
there  are  some  folks  that  are  hurt  by  international  treaties,  trade 
agreements.  And  I’m  one  who’s  been  advocating  making  sure  that 
folks don’t lose their homes, have a transition for mortgages for 12 
months  so  they  don’t  lose  their  homes  as  they’re  retraining  and 
finding another job. 

One  thing  we’ve  done  on  the  Foreign  Relations  Committee,  to 
Senator  Smith’s  comments  on  intellectual  property  and  piracy,  is 
provided  $5  million  to  help  train  and  enforce  copyright  or  intellec-
tual  property  rights,  and  make  sure  those  countries  are  enforcing 
them,  because  it’s  pretty  hard  for  us  to  do  it  in  another  country  if 
they don’t care about it there. 

Senator  Pryor,  on  the  issue  of  broadband—and  I  do  think 
broadband is important. And one issue we’re going to bring up here 
is  the  whole  Telecommunications  Act  and  getting  that  thing  up  to 
date  so  that  broadband  will  be  available.  It  is  the  way  that  small 
businesses  in  small  towns  and  rural  areas  can  communicate,  con-
duct business, get education and information. 

Your predecessor was helpful in my efforts to make sure that the 
Internet  was  not  taxed  with  access  taxes—on  average  of  about  18 
percent, if the state and local commissars have their way. Can you 
give us assurance that you’ll continue to be in favor of keeping the 
Internet  free  of  Internet  access  taxes,  no  matter  which  platform 
one  receives  broadband,  whether  it’s  by  DSL,  satellite,  over  power 
lines, or wireless? 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Senator,  I’m  very  much  in  favor  of  the  current 
status  and  the  fact  that  we  are  not  taxing  the  Internet.  And  it  is 
a  source  of  competitive  advantage.  It  is  something  that  we  cannot 
afford  to  fall  behind  on.  I  sometimes  read  about  some  countries 
which are making great progress on the Internet, and I don’t think 
we  can  afford  to  fall  behind.  So  I  share  that  concern,  and  I  share 
that vision for the future, as well. 

Senator  ALLEN.  Good,  because  I  think  the  people  who  would  be 
hurt  the  most  by  taxes  on  broadband  would  be,  clearly,  those  of 
lower income, as well as smaller jurisdictions. 

One  other  measure—that  I’ve  worked  on—and  this  Committee 
has  passed,  for  the  knowledge  of  some  of  the  new  Members—is  a 
measure to upgrade the technology capabilities at minority-serving 
institutions,  higher  education—whether  they’re  historically  black 
colleges and universities, tribal universities, or Hispanic-serving in-
stitutions—to  upgrade  their  technology  so  those  students  have  the 
faculty, the training, the education to get the good jobs, 60 percent 
of which require technological proficiency. And so, I’m going to keep

working  on  that.  We  got  it  through  the  Senate;  we’ve  got  to  get  it 
through the House and get the Administration onboard. 

But could you share with me any experiences that you’ve had as 
a leader of the Kellogg Company, insofar as working with minority-
serving institutions? 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Yes,  Senator.  We—several  years  ago,  we  joined 
a  partnership—in  a  partnership  with  Tom  Joyner,  who  is  a  radio 
broadcaster—and,  as  a  company,  we  made  donations  to  him  which 
were earmarked for historically black universities. And, as you talk 
about  bringing  technology  for  everyone  and  making  sure  that  ev-
eryone has access and making sure that our Internet and our tech-
nology  is  a  sign  of  our  freedom  and  our  democracy,  I  was  very 
proud,  as  a  business  leader,  to  be  able  to  contribute.  And  that’s 
been  my  experience.  There  are  ways  of  being  able  to  do  that.  Our 
experience  was  with  historically  black  universities,  but  I  under-
stand that there are others. So I appreciate your bringing that up. 
Senator  ALLEN.  Is  your  wonderful  bride,  Edilia,  and  your  chil-

dren going to be moving with you, if you are so-confirmed? 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Well, we are—we have just experienced the tran-
sition  to  empty-nesters,  although  we’ll  try  to  convince  some  of  our 
children to study here in Washington, Senator. 

Senator  ALLEN.  Well,  I  hope  you  will  reside  in  Virginia.  Choose 

Virginia, in this region. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  ALLEN.  You’ll  find  that  sales  taxes  on  your  cereals  are 

less than in the other jurisdictions. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator ALLEN. Thank you, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Snowe is recognized. 

STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE,

U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Senator SNOWE. And I ask unanimous consent to include my en-

tire statement in the record. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Snowe follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 
Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  calling  today’s  hearing  concerning  the  President’s 

nominee for Secretary of Commerce, Carlos M. Gutierrez. 

Mr.  Gutierrez,  welcome  to  the  Senate  Commerce  Committee  and  congratulations 
on your nomination. Let me begin by saying how impressed I am with your personal 
history and experience. As a corporate leader, you have proven yourself a skilled ex-
ecutive  and  innovative  leader  who  understands  what  it  takes  to  create  jobs  and 
build  a  business—and  you  will  certainly  need  that  entrepreneurial  know-how  writ 
large as you take the helm from Secretary Don Evans, who has served our country 
so effectively over the past four years. 

Your  nomination  comes  at  a  time  of  monumental  challenges  for  our  economy,  as 
unfair  trade  practices  and  currency  manipulation  deepen  our  nation’s  $535  billion, 
record-high  trade  deficit,  and  continue  to  threaten  U.S.  manufacturing  jobs.  Our 
trade relationship with China is particularly troublesome, with a $158 billion trade 
deficit, and is only exacerbated by a barrage of product dumping and the end of tex-
tile export quotas just last week. On that count, I urge you to review and act upon 
recommendations from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s 
2004 Report to Congress. That examination revealed that the U.S. is failing to vigi-
lantly protect intellectual property rights, and pointed out that we are not properly 
addressing China’s illegal trade subsidies and unfair manipulation of the yuan.

We  will  look  to  you  to  help  American  businesses  overcome  these  and  other  trade 
obstacles by aggressively enforcing our trade laws, standing up to violations and in-
sisting that WTO members abide by their own commitments. It is my hope that you 
will draw upon your international trade expertise as you fight to help our American 
workers and businesses compete and win on a level playing field. 

Because no industry has paid a steeper price for unfair trade than domestic man-
ufacturing,  which  lost  nearly  2.7  million  jobs  from  January  2001  through  August 
2004—and  17,600  in  my  home  State  of  Maine.  I  applaud  the  President  for  recog-
nizing the critical need for government to be a partner with domestic manufacturers 
by  appointing  the  first  ever  Assistant  Secretary  of  Manufacturing  and  Services—a 
post to which he named Albert Frink, Jr. It is imperative that you work closely with 
Mr.  Frink  to  promote  open  markets  and  a  level  playing  field,  as  well  as  developing 
strategies to lower the structural costs for U.S. manufacturers and help those firms 
remain  competitive.  As  we  take  those  steps  forward,  let  us  also  understand  that  it 
is counter-intuitive to take any leaps backward by reducing programs like the Man-
ufacturing  Extension  Partnership.  I  was  pleased  to  help  lead  efforts  in  the  Senate 
to restore the MEP to a funding level of $109 million for FY 2005, and I am troubled 
by  suggestions  that  the  Administration’s  budget  may  severely  reduce  funding  for 
this invaluable program. So that is certainly one issue I hope we can come together 
on. 

Shifting  from  land  to  sea,  as  a  Senator  from  a  state  with  a  three  quarter  billion 
dollar  fishing  industry,  I  am  acutely  concerned  with  the  stewardship  of  our  oceans. 
And  as  Chair  of  the  Commerce  Subcommittee  on  Oceans,  Fisheries,  and  Coast 
Guard,  I  am  responsible  for  overseeing  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Ad-
ministration—which comprises 59 percent of the Department of Commerce’s budget. 
In that oversight role, I have seen both the opportunity and dire need for enhanc-
ing  NOAA—and  the  time  for  action  is  now.  A  clear  starting  point  is  the  U.S.  Com-
mission  on  Ocean  Policy’s  final  report—which  includes  212  recommendations.  One 
pressing  priority  among  the  recommendations  is  establishing  a  global  ocean  and 
coastal observation system. And indeed, the urgency of such action was underscored 
by  the  unfathomable  toll  of  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami—about  which  NOAA  alerted 
only  two  of  eleven  affected  countries.  That  narrow  warning  demonstrates  the  cur-
rent  observation  system  limitations,  but  also  raises  questions  about  the  unrespon-
siveness  of  the  NOAA  bureaucracy  in  apparently  not  having  the  ability  to  contact 
all  vulnerable  nations.  Sadly,  another  case  of  bureaucratic  paralysis  contributed  to 
tragedy last month, as five fisherman died while scalloping—trying to avoid ill-con-
ceived NMFS penalties that encourage fisherman to remain at sea even under dan-
gerous  weather  conditions.  So  recognizing  the  grave  challenges  facing  the  agency, 
I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  to  make  NOAA  as  responsive  and  effective  as 
possible, as quickly as possible. 

As  Secretary  you  will  also  help  develop  the  Administration’s  telecom  policy,  just 
as  Congress  embarks  on  anticipated  reform  of  the  Telecom  Act  of  1996.  The  Presi-
dent  has  called  for  universal  affordable  access  to  broadband  technology  by  the  year 
2007,  and  recently-passed  spectrum  relocation  legislation  will  help  make  next  gen-
eration  wireless  telephone  technologies  a  reality.  I  could  not  be  more  supportive  of 
these  initiatives  that  promise  to  bridge  the  economic  and  technological  divide  be-
tween urban and rural areas. Also critical is strengthening Universal Service, as the 
Universal Service High Cost Fund and the E-Rate Program guarantee affordable ac-
cess  to  phone  and  Internet  service  for  all  segments  of  our  society.  And  that’s  why, 
when  an  arbitrary  application  of  new  accounting  rules  prevented  the  issuance  of 
$400  million  in  E-Rate  funding  to  schools  and  libraries,  Senator  Rockefeller  and  I 
fought  successfully  to  exempt  the  Universal  Service  Fund  from  those  accounting 
rules—an exemption that should be made permanent this year. 

Again,  Mr.  Gutierrez,  I  welcome  you  to  the  Commerce  Committee  and  thank  you 

for your willingness to serve our country. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Senator SNOWE. And I also want to welcome our new colleagues, 

here on the Committee, as well. 

I  want  to  welcome  you,  Mr.  Gutierrez,  and  am  looking  forward 
to  working  with  you  in  the  future.  Certainly,  the  Commerce  De-
partment has a number of issues that are vital, not only to my own 
constituency in Maine, but throughout this country. 

And, first and foremost, I know that many have raised the issue 
of trade. And, certainly, that is—been one of my major areas of con-
cern  for  some  time,  since  I’ve  been  in  both  the  House  and  Senate, 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  09:43 Nov 14, 2005 Jkt 022734 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22734.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

29

particularly from the standpoint that our government has failed to 
aggressively enforce our trade laws. And you’re in a prime position, 
given  your  very  impressive  personal  history  and  your  entrepre-
neurial abilities, and being a skilled leader and corporate executive, 
in how to create jobs and to build a business, and I think that en-
trepreneurial  spirit  will  be  absolutely  vital  at  a  time  when  we’re 
confronting monumental change in our own economy. 

As  others  have  mentioned  here,  you  know,  we  have  had,  obvi-
ously, huge disparities with respect to trade, unfair trade subsidies. 
We’ve had currency manipulation, certainly by China. And that has 
certainly  aggravated  the  domestic  manufacturing  sector.  Certainly 
the case in Maine, and it’s true across America. 

Whereas,  you  probably  know,  there  are  more  than  2.7  million 
jobs that have been lost in the manufacturing segment of our econ-
omy;  and,  in  Maine  over  the  last  4  years,  17,600  jobs.  And  so,  it 
is  vital  that  we  aggressively  pursue  the  tools  to  enforce  our  agree-
ments. 

And  I  would  encourage  you  to  review  the—Congress  created  a 
commission,  the  U.S.–China  Economic  and  Security  Review  Com-
mission, and it recently issued a report. And it was—that examina-
tion  indicated,  very  specifically  and  explicitly,  that  the  U.S.  was 
failing to vigilantly protect intellectual property rights. And it also 
said  that  we  were  not  properly  addressing  China’s  illegal  trade 
subsidies,  and,  of  course,  the  unfair  manipulation  of  its  currency, 
the  yuan.  And  I  know  that’s  not  your  area.  But  it’s  all,  I  think, 
intertwined to the problems that we’re facing that has undermined 
our manufacturing sector unfairly. 

So,  I  would  hope  you  would  use  your  leadership  and  your  abili-
ties  and  your  knowledge  to  fight  these  issues  and  to  challenge  our 
trading  partners,  where  they  are  trading  illegally,  unfairly,  and 
also  holding  our  WTO  members  accountable  to  the  commitments 
that  they’re  required  to  make.  And,  certainly,  that  has  been  the 
case  with  China  in  the  past,  and  that’s  why  we’ve  got  this  enor-
mous record-high trade deficit. 

It  all  goes  back  to  the  domestic  manufacturing  sector  that  has 
paid a very steep price for this unfairness. And so, you really have 
a  prime  opportunity.  And  I  urge  you,  and  I  encourage  you,  to  use 
it, to fight on behalf of our industry. 

You know, the President created, for the first time ever, a manu-
facturing czar, an Assistant Secretary for Manufacturing, and that 
was  recently  filled  as  a  position,  and  I  would  hope  that  you  would 
work  with  the  Assistant  Secretary,  Mr.  Frink,  to  work  on  these 
issues,  to  open  up  markets,  to  help,  as  others  have  indicated  here, 
to reduce the structural costs to manufacturers so that they can re-
main competitive and to keep that competitive edge. 

So, I would hope that you would use the auspices of this position 
to  do  all  that  you  can  to  enforce  these  agreements.  And  I  hope  we 
can work, in the future, in that area. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator. I appreciate the encourage-
ment.  And,  as  a  manufacturer  and  someone  who  has  worked  in 
manufacturing  for  all  my  life,  I  believe  that  manufacturing  is  a 
competitive advantage. I believe we have some of the best factories 
in  the  world,  and  the  technologies  and  the  supply  chain  systems 
and just the ability to use manufacturing to make us more efficient

than  our  competition  abroad.  So  I  share  that,  and  I  thank  you, 
Senator, for that. 

Senator  SNOWE.  I  appreciate  that.  And  I  also  would  certainly 
point  out  that  one  program  within  the  Commerce  Department  is 
the  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  Program—it’s  now  the 
Hollings  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership—and  that  program 
is  vital  to  manufacturers.  And  I  was  very  concerned  that  that  pro-
gram  was  cut—in  fact,  from,  like,  106  million  in  2004,  to  39  mil-
lion.  It’s  sort  of  counterintuitive,  at  a  time  in  which  we’re  creating 
a new position for Assistant Secretary for Manufacturing, we were 
cutting  the  program  that  provides  the  very  tools  and  expertise  to 
manufacturers in our country. We now have restored it to its prop-
er  funding  level,  but  I  understand  the  Administration’s  budget 
might  contain  another  severe  cut,  and  I  think  that’s  the  wrong  di-
rection,  the  wrong  message  at  a  time  in  which  our  manufacturers 
have  been  hurting  as  a  result  of  all  the  issues  that  I  have  raised. 
So, I hope you will be very supportive of that program. 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  I  will  look  into  that  as  soon  as  I  get  into  the 

budget, Senator Snowe. 
Senator SNOWE. OK. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. And I will——
Senator SNOWE. Great. I hope so. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes. 
Senator  SNOWE.  And  I  would  like  to  talk  to  you  further  about 

that, as well. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. I would look forward to that. 
Senator  SNOWE.  Another  area—because  I  know  my  time  will  be 
expiring, so can I shift from land to sea—I have chaired the Ocean, 
Fisheries,  and  Coast  Guard  Subcommittee.  And,  as  the  Chairman 
indicated,  NOAA  represents  about  59  percent  of  the  Commerce 
budget. So it’s a critical program. And the stewardship to the ocean 
is  absolutely  vital.  And  I  would  commend  you,  as  well,  to  the  U.S. 
Commission  on  Ocean  Policy  and  the  212  recommendations  that 
they have made. And to use your leadership to begin to work with 
the Committee and the Congress to systematically implement those 
recommendations,  where  we  can,  to  find  the  funding  on  those  crit-
ical  issues,  because  it  is  evermore  important.  In  fact,  I  do  believe 
that  we  should  create  a  national  global  warning  system,  ocean  ob-
serving  and  warning  system.  And  I  have  established  one  in  the 
State of Maine, and I have recommended, and the Commission has 
recommended, creating a national system. And we can tie it to the 
tsunami warning system. I know there’s a Pacific warning system, 
and  I’ve  had  concerns  about  NOAA,  and  I  have  expressed  that  re-
cently,  after  the  devastating  tsunami,  where  they  did  not  contact 
officials  in  other  countries.  They  did  contact  Australia,  and  Aus-
tralia contacted Indonesia when there were signs of this impending 
tsunami  in  the  Indian  Ocean.  I  realize  it’s  a  Pacific  warning  sys-
tem,  but  I  think  we  have  to  work  through  those  issues  to  see  how 
we can set up an observation system that will work. 

And this global warning system can work in that regard, not only 

for monitoring the sea, but also to provide these indications.

Senator SNOWE. I guess my time is up. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF HON. TRENT LOTT,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI 

Senator LOTT. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I’m delighted 
to be here this afternoon, with you presiding for the first time over 
this  Committee.  I’m  looking  forward  to  an  exciting  2  years  under 
your leadership. 

I  want  to  say  how  proud  I  am  to  have  the  new  Members,  and 
I’ve  already  been  visiting,  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle,  and  I’ve  been 
assured  that  the  gentleman  from  Arkansas  is  going  to  be  voting 
with me more over the next 2 years than he did the previous years. 
And I’ll get around to Nelson next. 

And  I  want  to  say,  Mr.  Gutierrez,  that  we’re  very  proud  of  you. 
Like  others,  we  know  of  your  history  and  what  a  magnificent  life 
you’ve lived. And we congratulate you on your nomination, and we 
extend to your family, sitting behind you, our thanks for their will-
ingness to sacrifice so that you can do this job. So, to you, congratu-
lations; to them, commiserations. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator LOTT. We understand that there’s a certain loss of funds 

involved in this process. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  LOTT.  But  we’re  so  proud  that  you’re  willing  to  do  it. 

We’re looking forward to working with you. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator  LOTT.  Mr.  Secretary-designee,  do  you  remember  the  pic-

ture I drew for you——

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, sir. 
Senator LOTT.—when you visited? What was that? 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. I still have it. 
Senator LOTT. What——
Mr. GUTIERREZ. It’s a picture of a fish. 
Senator LOTT. Very good. Very good. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator LOTT. You’re going to be fine. 
Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  If  confirmed,  I  would  like  to  get  it  framed,  Sen-

ator. 

Senator  LOTT.  Well,  you  can  feel  free  to  do  so.  And  with  your 
predecessor,  every  time  I  got  a  letter  from  him,  or  sent  one,  there 
was always a fish drawn at the bottom of the letter. But the prob-
lem  is,  at  Commerce,  you’ve  got  so  many  things  you’re  going  to  be 
dealing with, important issues, that sometimes fisheries sort of fall 
off the end of the table. And that’s unfortunate, because this is a—
it’s a tremendous industry. It creates jobs, produces revenue. I com-
mend  the  new  Senator  from  Louisiana.  I  was  afraid  we  wouldn’t 
hear  any  more  about  Gulf  shrimp,  but—with  John  Breaux  gone—
but  I’m  reassured  that  I’ve  got  an  ally  here,  and  am  making  the 
point to you that fisheries are in the Gulf, not just in the Northeast 
and the Northwest. And we’ll look forward to working with you on 
that. 

I also join my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, and particu-
larly the new Senator from South Carolina, on the trade issue. Like 
most  of  them,  I  have  voted  consistently  for  all  the  trade  agree-
ments—GATT,  NAFTA,  China  agreement,  all  of  them—but  I  do 
think  that  we’ve  got  to  also  use  common  sense,  and  we’ve  got  to

make  sure  that  they  are—our  trading  partners  are  fair  in  their 
treatment and dealings with us. They have not been. 

I was pleased to see the rulings with regard to shrimp. I thought 
that  the  Administration  has  done  some  good  work  in  the  timber 
area.  But  don’t  let  it  slip  away.  And  not  good  enough  yet.  And  I 
could just go down the list. 

I just hope that you will continue to push for trade and—Ameri-
cans can compete as long as they don’t cheat on the other side. So 
I won’t repeat all of that. 

And,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  consent  that  my  entire  statement  be 

made a part of the record. 

The CHAIRMAN. It will be. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Lott follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. TRENT LOTT, U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI 

Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman,  and  congratulations  on  holding  your  first  hearing  as 
Chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Commerce,  Science  and  Transportation.  I  met  with 
Mr.  Gutierrez  last  month  and  am  impressed  with  his  personal  story  and  his  busi-
ness  background.  I  look  forward  to  moving  his  nomination  through  this  Committee 
and the Senate as soon as possible. 

The  Department  of  Commerce  has  a  diverse  collection  of  agencies  with  a  variety 
of  missions,  but  I  would  like  Mr.  Gutierrez  to  focus  on  three  specific  areas:  oceans 
and fisheries; trade enforcement; and automotive manufacturing. 

My  interest  in  Gulf  of  Mexico  fisheries  is  well  known  to  his  predecessors,  as  I’m 
sure  it  will  be  with  him.  It  is  important  that  he  understand  that  fisheries  issues 
in  the  Gulf  are  often  different  from  those  in  the  Chairman’s  home  State  of  Alaska, 
or  from  those  in  New  England,  but  no  less  important.  The  Gulf  commercial  fishing 
industry has been the subject of intensive regulation by the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries 
Management  Council  without  adequate  representation  on  that  Council  and  Gulf 
fisheries have not received adequate support from the Department and its agencies. 
I hope that Mr. Gutierrez will improve on that record. 

While  I  am  a  supporter  of  expanded  international  trade,  I  also  insist  that  it  be 
conducted  fairly.  The  Department  of  Commerce  has  a  vital  role  in  protecting  U.S. 
industries against unfair dumping by other countries. I believe the Department has 
made a good effort to address this problem with respect to imported shrimp and Ca-
nadian  softwood  lumber.  I  hope  Mr.  Gutierrez  will  ensure  that  the  Department 
strongly enforces U.S. laws against unfair trade actions by other countries. This will 
make our current and future trade agreements more effective. 

I  note  that  last  month  the  Department  of  Commerce  announced  a  new  partner-
ship, called the U.S. A–TEAM, directed at improving the competitiveness of the U.S. 
automotive  industry.  However,  I  am  concerned  that  this  partnership  includes  one 
foreign-owned  company,  DaimlerChrysler,  but  excludes  others  with  a  significant 
manufacturing  and  R&D  presence  in  the  United  States,  especially  Nissan  North 
America.  I  call  on  Mr.  Gutierrez  to  recognize  that  the  U.S.  automotive  industry  is 
much broader than Ford, GM, and DaimlerChrysler by expanding the U.S. A–TEAM 
partnership to companies such as Nissan that are growing the automotive industry 
here in America. 

I thank the Chairman and ask that my statement be included in the record.

Senator  LOTT.  One  point,  though,  that  I  don’t  believe  has  been 
raised,  and  that’s  with  regard  to  the  new  partnership  called  the 
U.S.  A–Team.  Has  anybody  asked  about  that?  This  is  directed  at 
improving  competitiveness  of  the  U.S.  automotive  industry,  and 
it—but  it  only  includes—it  includes  just—basically,  Ford,  General 
Motors, and DaimlerChrysler, but not other foreign companies that 
have  significant  domestic  activity.  And  that  could—you  know,  that 
includes, obviously, Nissan and Honda and Toyota and—well, Mer-
cedes is DaimlerChrysler. 

I’d like you to take a look at this and make sure that we are ap-
proaching this right, that we don’t penalize companies that are cre-

ating jobs and doing significant business in this country. To include 
one  foreign  company,  but  not  others  that  are  doing  this  domestic 
work, I believe is a mistake, and I hope that you will look at that. 
And I’d appreciate a response from you when—once you get settled 
in.  It’s  an  issue  that,  obviously,  I’m  not  going  to  use  in  any  way 
to delay. 

I  look  forward  to  voting  for  your  nomination  and  confirmation, 

and to working with you in the next 4 years. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator Lott. 
Senator LOTT. Thank you. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Appreciate it. Thank you. 
Senator LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Let me recognize Senator Nelson. 

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON,

U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Senator BILL NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Gutierrez, a lot of my constituents are very proud of you. We 
have  a  very  large  Cuban-American  community,  as  you  know. 
Bienvenido al Senado. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Gracias. Gracias. 
Senator  BILL NELSON.  We’ve  talked,  already,  about  a  number  of 
issues, when you and I had the opportunity to sit down. I just want 
to  underscore.  Because  since  we  had  our  personal  visit,  and  I  told 
you  about  the  fact  that  Brazil,  if  it  were  to  have  the  tariff  elimi-
nated  on  Florida  citrus,  would  not  become  free  trade;  it  would  be-
come  monopoly  trade.  They  would  have  100  percent  of  the  world 
market.  But  since  then,  in  late  December,  as  reported  by  the  Wall 
Street  Journal,  the  Brazilians  are  still  up  to  no  good.  They  are 
dumping, on the market, both frozen concentrate, at 37 percent less 
than production costs, and selling pasteurized not-from-concentrate 
juice at 78 percent lower than production costs. The Commerce De-
partment  is  going  to  weigh  in  on  these  kinds  of  things,  and  I  just 
want to underscore to you what we had talked about before. 

I flew on one of your hurricane hunters. And, as a matter of fact, 
I  was  flying  off  the  southern  coast  of  Cuba,  as  we  had  surrounded 
Hurricane  Charley,  as  it  was  moving  to  the  northwest,  dropping 
those  instruments  that  gave  realtime  data  that,  then,  we  collected 
on  the  airplane  and  beamed  it  by  satellite  back  to  the  National 
Hurricane  Center,  and  has  given  us  the  opportunity  for  very  accu-
rate forecasting. And then, lo and behold, we end up getting hit by 
four hurricanes within a 6-week period. Some of your equipment is 
getting  old.  Those  aircraft  that  are  like  the  Navy  P–3s,  and  they 
need a replacement. NOAA is a big part of your Department. 

I think Senator Snowe mentioned that it was actually the NOAA 
Pacific  Tsunami  Warning  Center  in  Hawaii  that  picked  up  the 
earthquake off Indonesia, but they didn’t have the buoys out there 
to know where the tsunami was going. But they alerted people that 
there  was  a  9.0  earthquake.  And  with  a  little-better  warning  sys-
tem, we can be a little more accurate. 

And  then,  in  your  Department,  you  have  the  National  Tele-
communications  and  Information  Administration  that  oversees 
Federal  Government  spectrum  usage  of  the  electromagnetic  spec-

trum.  We  simply  need  to  relieve  some  of  the  spectrum  that  now, 
with  digital,  can  be  combined  and—do  what  with  it?  To  give  it  to 
first-responders.  And  that  was  one  of  the  recommendations  of  the 
9/11 Commission. 

We have battled here on this Committee, because there are pow-
erful  entities  that  we  are  battling.  And  yet,  for  the  good  of  the 
country, we’re going to have to do that, and we’re going to have to 
accommodate  all  these  people  in  the  telecommunications  industry. 

So, Mr. Chairman, I’ll leave it at that. 
Eventually,  we’re  going  to  have  to  address  the  intellectual  prop-
erty  issue  with  regard  to  other  countries,  particularly  China.  That 
means  a  great  deal  to  our  country  and  to  its  ability  to  compete  in 
the  world,  and  that’s  going  to  be  in  your  sphere  of  influence,  as 
well. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Nelson? 

STATEMENT OF HON. E. BENJAMIN NELSON,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA 
Senator BEN NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
And thank you, Mr. Gutierrez, for being here today. I enjoyed our 
brief conversation the other evening, and I look forward to working 
with you. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator  BEN NELSON.  Nebraska’s  economy,  as  is  the  case  with 
many economies in the Midwest, is driven by agricultural and non-
agricultural trade, especially as it pertains to exports to other parts 
of the world. I doubt that you expected to talk as much about trade 
today  as,  perhaps,  you  have,  given  the  fact  that  Ambassador 
Zoellick gets an earful, as well, about the challenges we have with 
trade,  the  growing  deficit  that  we  have  in  so  many  parts  of  the 
world,  particularly  with  the  People’s  Republic  of  China;  the  weak 
dollar  and  how  that  is  supposed  to  work  to  our  benefit,  but  it  gets 
pegged  by  other  currency  and,  therefore,  there  is  no  major  advan-
tage;  the  European  barriers,  which  I  suspect  you  may  know  first 
hand, coming from the food-processing and packaging and distribu-
tion  industry,  as  it  relates  to  the  genetically  modified  organisms 
and all the other ways that the Europeans seem to have not to im-
port  our  agricultural  products.  And  you  probably  have  received  an 
earful about the importance of free trade combined with fair trade, 
so  that  we  do  have  the  ability  to  throw  a  flag  when  there’s  a—
where  there’s  an  infraction,  to  try  to  get  something  resolved  as 
quickly as we possibly can. 

Having  set  that  up  as  a  background,  without  setting  you  up,  do 
you have any particular thoughts about what you might do to work 
with  Ambassador  Zoellick,  within  the  Administration,  and  with 
this Committee and others, to try to resolve some of the major dis-
putes,  such  as  with  the  European  trading  partners,  perhaps  with 
Canada and some of the areas that we challenge there. You under-
stand  the  sugar  challenges  that  we’ve  had  there  in  the  past.  Ne-
braska  is  also  a  sugar  state,  as  well.  So  maybe  you  have  some 
thoughts,  just  general  thoughts  that  you  have.  One  big  idea  or

35

something  that  might  be  able  to  give  us  some  idea  of  what  you 
have in mind. 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Well,  Senator,  one  of  the  things  that  you  men-
tioned,  the  whole  subject  of  non-tariff  barriers,  is  something  that 
I have personally lived through over——

Senator BEN NELSON. Yes. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ.—you know, 29 years. 
Senator BEN NELSON. Yes, you have. 
Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Little  things  like  the  vitamin  fortification  that 
we  have  in  the  U.S.  is  not  accepted  in  Canada,  so,  therefore,  our 
products,  if  they’re  going  to  be  exported,  they  have  to  be  re-manu-
factured,  which  adds  some  cost.  We  have  the  same  problem  across 
the European Union, where some countries will just say, ‘‘We don’t 
want fortification.’’ So, therefore, we have to manufacture specially 
for  them,  which  raises  our  costs.  And  I  think  that  is  something 
that, perhaps, is a little bit under the radar, but it’s there. 

Senator BEN NELSON. It’s there. 
Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  It’s  there,  and  our  products  have  been  held  up, 
in  many  countries,  in  many  markets,  because  of  these  hard-to-ex-
plain  non-tariff  barriers.  And  it’s  something  that  I  would  like  to 
work with the U.S. Trade Representative to try to put the issue on 
the  table  and  begin  to  address  it,  because  it  is  as  impactful  as  a 
tariff. It impedes us from actually competing in those markets. 

Senator BEN NELSON. As it relates to the currency, I suspect that 
Secretary  Snow  has  some  interest  in  that,  and  you’ll  have  the  op-
portunity  to  work  with  him.  But  we  were  all  told  that  a  weak  dol-
lar would be good for exports from America, because the high value 
of the other currency should be able to buy more. We haven’t seen 
that occur. Do you have any thoughts about that? 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Senator,  respectfully,  I  will  refrain  from  having 

any thoughts on the currency, if you’ll allow me. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  BEN NELSON.  Well,  can  you  assure  me  that  you’ll  talk 

to Secretary Snow about it? Because I intend to——

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, sir. 
Senator BEN NELSON.—as well. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes, Senator. 
Senator  BEN NELSON.  As  it  relates  to  balance  of  trade,  as  you 
look to the future, because of the importance of exports from Amer-
ica,  particularly  as  it  relates  to  manufactured  goods,  do  you  have 
any  thoughts  about  steel  prices?  You’ve  said,  ‘‘Steel  has  been  part 
of our past, and will be part of our future.’’ But the challenge that 
we  have  right  now  with  the  steel  prices  in  the  U.S.  versus  steel 
prices elsewhere, and the outsourcing and the offshoring of jobs——
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Senator, I’m aware that steel is a major concern 
and a major problem. I am not aware of the intricacies of the price 
differences and subsidies that foreign countries may be receiving at 
our  expense.  But,  as  I  mentioned  to  Senator  Rockefeller,  that  is 
something that I want to look into, and it concerns me, as well. 

Senator BEN NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Gutierrez. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, sir. 
Senator BEN NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.

Mr. Gutierrez, we’ll start a second round if anyone wants to ask 
questions.  I’ve  neglected  to  go  through  my  usual  procedure  of  ex-
plaining  to  you  the  state  that  I  represent,  Mr.  Gutierrez.  We  have 
half the coastline of the United States. We are one-fifth the size of 
the  lower  48.  We  have  very  few  roads,  and  we  depend  primarily 
upon  aviation.  But  we  use  the  oceans  a  lot.  We  are  involved  with 
your people, with EDA, with tourism, with trade, with science, and 
with NOAA, but there’s only one way to really understand Alaska, 
and that’s to come see us. So you have my invitation, when——

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator. 
The  CHAIRMAN.—you’re  the  Secretary,  to  come  soon,  and  we’ll 
have a little side venture, which should be a little bit of exploration 
to see how we recover from the oceans some of the creatures of the 
deep. Some people call it ‘‘fishing.’’

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  I  look  forward  to  introducing  you  to  my  state, 
and  hopefully  we’ll  take  the  whole  Committee  up  there  sometime. 
But I do encourage you, at your first opportunity, to come visit us. 
Have you ever been to Alaska? 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Senator,  I  have  not,  and—actually,  I  just  spoke 
with  someone  who  was  on  a  terrific  tour  of  Alaska,  one  of  these 
cruise tours, and they said it was the most incredible thing they’ve 
ever  seen  in  their  life.  So  I  don’t  know  what  my  travel  schedule 
is—I  haven’t  seen  a  travel  schedule—but  I  make  a  commitment  to 
be in Alaska as soon as possible, sir. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  The  President,  by  executive  order,  recently  cre-
ated  a  new  Oceans  Commission—it’s  really  a  committee  on  ocean 
policy,  as  I  understand  it—within  the  White  House.  This  is  pri-
marily the jurisdiction of your Department, but we’re going to take 
that  initiative  and  try  to  work  with  the  new  Committee.  And  we 
would  encourage  you  to  join  us—get  your  people  from  NOAA—so 
that  we  can  work  in  partnership  and  not  end  up  in  crossed  pur-
poses, as far as this new initiative is concerned. 

I  think  we  will  have  a  Subcommittee  that  addresses  the  ocean 
policy.  I  want  to  reconstruct—really,  call  back  into  existence—the 
National  Ocean  Policy  Study,  which  was  authorized  by  Congress 
several Congresses ago. It, sort of, was ignored for a couple of Con-
gresses, but we’re going to put it back into being. So, it will be an-
other  function  of  this  Committee  that  I  would  urge  you  to  become 
familiar with. 

This Committee also started an initiative on tourism. And we be-
lieve  that  the  tourism  portion  of  our  trade  is  extremely  important. 
And the Congress passed a bill that we initiated here, and we look 
forward to working with you on that. The funding——

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN.—on that is very small. 
But  I  do  want  to  tell  you  that—I  don’t  have  any  more  ques-
tions—I think your willingness to serve this nation, that has served 
you  so  well  for  your  own  career—and  the  freedoms  of  this  country 
are  demonstrated  by  your  being  here,  as  you  stated  yourself.  We 
look  forward  to  trying  to  work  with  you  to  develop  a  strong  rela-
tionship  with  your  Department,  so  that  we  don’t  have  investiga-
tions;  we  have  active  participation,  on  a  bipartisan  basis,  on  legis-
lation,  or  amendments  to  legislation,  that  are  necessary  to  make

the programs that you administer function, and function as best as 
we possibly can arrange for them to do so. 

I  do  thank  you,  again,  for  agreeing  to  meet  with  us  here  this 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  We’ll  do  our  best  to  get  this  nomination  to  the 
floor  and  voted  on  after  the  first  vote  that  the  Senate  will  make. 
It may be tomorrow. We’re not sure. 

I would yield to my good friend and colleague—we call each other 
‘‘co-chairman.’’  We  also  call  each  other  ‘‘brother.’’  So,  we  look  for-
ward to working with you in tandem. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr.  Chairman,  I  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Committee, 
and  I  commit  to  you  to  working  in  partnership  with  this  Com-
mittee, sir. 

Senator INOUYE. Mr. Chairman, before proceeding with my ques-
tions,  I’d  like  to,  most  respectfully,  suggest  to  the  Secretary-des-
ignee  that  when  Chairman  Stevens  invites  you  to  Alaska,  there’s 
only one answer:——

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Yes. 
Senator INOUYE.—‘‘Yes.’’
[Laughter.] 
Senator  LOTT.  Could  I  inquire  of  the  Senator  from  Hawaii, 
maybe  a  trip  with  the  Secretary  to  your  state  would  be  in  order. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  INOUYE.  My  only  problem  is,  they  all  want  to  go  there.

Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I’d  like  to  submit  questions  for 

the record.

The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, that will be submitted. 
The CHAIRMAN. And we would ask that you respond, to the ques-
tions  that  have  been  submitted  to  you,  by  Friday,  if  it’s  possible, 
Mr. Secretary. 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Yes,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  will  do  everything  pos-

Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Gutierrez,  I’ve  had  the  high  privilege  and 
the  great  honor  of  serving  in  the  Congress  for—since  1949—1959, 
I’m sorry—and in the Senate for 42 years. And in that period, I’ve 
had  the  opportunity  to  work  with  Cabinet  Secretaries,  appointees 
of  several  Presidents.  And  all  of  them  would  have  resumes  speak-
ing highly of their academic accomplishments, doctorate from Har-
vard, or a Ph.D. from some other place, Oxford and all of this. And 
all  the  appointees  that  I’ve  sat  through  on  their  hearings  of  this 
nature, you’re the only appointee that I know of who has no college 
degree. And the job that you’re about to undertake is a highly tech-
nical  one.  What  makes  your  background  such  that  you  believe 
would well serve the country as Secretary of Commerce? 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator. 
I would like to say, first of all, that, although you’re right, I don’t 
possess  a  college  degree,  I  have  never  ceased  to  be  a  student,  and 
I have been a student of business for 30 years. And I will be a stu-
dent  of—if  confirmed—of  the  Commerce  Department,  as  I  have 
been of business. And perhaps the fact that I did not have a college 
degree,  working  my  way  up  the  system,  forced  me  to  work,  some-

times, harder; to work sometimes smarter. But I always knew that 
perhaps I had a handicap that I had to confront. 

I  have  been  able  to  work  around  the  world,  which  I  consider  a 
great fortune, being able to work with different cultures, being able 
to  understand  the  nuances  of  how  to  deal  with  people  of  other 
countries,  the  minor  nuances  of  the  difference  between  an  Argen-
tinian and a Chilean, the difference between Korea and China and 
Japan,  which,  as  you  know,  are  very  marked.  And  I  think  that  is 
something  that  I  can  bring  to  this  job—very  practical  experience 
and  knowledge  of  dealing  with  foreign  cultures  and  understanding 
how to get the best of our foreign partners. 

Also,  growing  up  in  the  system—and,  as  you’ve  mentioned,  I’ve 
had many MBAs reporting to me over my career. If it’s—one thing 
that  it  has  done  is  taught  me  the  value  of  having  the  best  people 
you can, and that, really, a team is only as good as its people, and 
a  good  leader  surrounds  himself  or  herself  with  the  best  people, 
and  hopefully  would  have  the  self-confidence  to  do  so.  I  have  been 
able  to  do  that.  I  think  that’s  a  big  part  of  why  I  am  where  I  am. 
I  am  very  pleased  that,  in  my  few  weeks  in  Washington,  I  have 
met some of the brightest people I’ve ever met in my life. And that 
is a great source of motivation, a great source of inspiration for me. 
So  I  hope  to  bring  those  things,  I  hope  to  add  value.  That  is  my 
prime  objective,  Senators—to  bring  something  to  the  party,  to  add 
value,  to  deliver  results,  which  is  really  what  I  have  been  trained 
to  do  throughout  my  30-year  career.  And,  hopefully,  maybe  even, 
one  day,  as  I  have  told  my  wife,  just  go  back  and  pick  up  on  that 
one piece of my life and get a college degree. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  INOUYE.  Well,  yours  is  an  extraordinary  American  suc-
cess  story.  And  I  know  that  it’s  quite  un-senatorial  to  announce 
your decision before decision-time, but I’m prepared to cast my vote 
in your favor at this moment. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator INOUYE. I think America is fortunate to have you, sir. 
Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator INOUYE. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Does any Senator wish anything further? 
[No response.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  We  really  do  commend  you  for  coming  here  on 
such  short  notice.  I  want  to  tell  you  that  I  served  as  an  assistant 
to  a  Cabinet  Officer,  Secretary  of  the  Interior  Fred  Seaton,  who 
had  no  college  degree.  One  of  the  finest  men  I  ever  worked  with, 
and  probably  the  brightest.  So  I  feel  sorry  for  your  assistants,  be-
cause  I  think  you  know  how  to  work,  and  you’ll  work  the  people 
around you as they should work. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. And we’re happy to have you, and I’ll join my col-
league in voting for your confirmation and bring it before the Sen-
ate as rapidly as possible. 

Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much for taking on the challenge 

Mr.  GUTIERREZ.  Thank  you  very  much.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair-

of this job.

A P P E N D I X

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN MCCAIN TO

CARLOS M. GUTIERREZ 

Question  1.  In  2001,  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)  reported  the  fol-
lowing:  ‘‘Greenhouse  gases  are  accumulating  in  the  Earth’s  atmosphere  as  a  result 
of  human  activities,  causing  surface  air  temperatures  and  subsurface  ocean  tem-
peratures  to  rise.  Temperatures  are,  in  fact,  rising.  The  changes  observed  over  the 
last  several  decades  are  likely  mostly  due  to  human  activities,  but  we  cannot  rule 
out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural varia-
bility.’’ Do you agree with the NAS’s assessment? 

Answer.  I  do  not  know  whether  NAS’s  assessment  is  correct.  While  I  am  not  an 
expert  on  climate  change,  I  will  work  closely  with  the  Under  Secretary  for  Oceans 
and  Atmosphere,  Conrad  Lautenbacher,  and  the  National  Oceanic  &  Atmospheric 
Administration  (NOAA)  to  increase  my  understanding  of  this  important  issue.  The 
NAS  question  points  to  significant  uncertainties  in  the  field  of  climate  change 
science. I understand that the Climate Change Science Program, an interagency re-
search effort led by the Department of Commerce and NOAA, is working on the key 
uncertainties  in  climate  change  science  in  order  to  provide  the  federal,  state,  and 
local  officials  and  the  private  sector  with  the  most  up-to-date  information  products 
to  support  decision-making  concerning  climate  change  issues.  I  intend  to  continue 
Secretary  Evans’  support  for  these  efforts,  as  well  as  the  parallel  interagency  Cli-
mate  Change  Technology  Program,  led  by  the  Department  of  Energy,  which  is  di-
recting substantial research and development work on new technologies intended to 
reduce, avoid, or capture greenhouse gases.

Question 2. In a December 2004 report issued by the Council on Competitiveness 
on  Innovation  (Council),  the  Council  stated  that  where,  how,  and  why  innovation 
occurs  are  in  flux  and  that  the  barriers  to  innovation  are  falling.  The  Council’s  re-
port  further  asserts  that  for  innovation  in  the  United  States  to  thrive  it  will  not 
be enough—in fact, it could be counterproductive—simply to intensify current stim-
uli, policies, and management strategies, and to make incremental improvements to 
organizational  structures  and  curricula.  As  a  former  CEO  of  a  major  international 
corporation,  what  changes  do  you  believe  are  necessary  in  our  nation’s  innovation 
system to ensure continued leadership in this area? 

Answer.  While  I  am  not  in  a  position  to  discuss  changes  to  the  Nation’s  innova-
tion system at the present time, I know firsthand that innovation is the key to our 
economic future. I am pleased that virtually the entire Department has been playing 
a leading role in advancing innovation. Innovation makes our nation more competi-
tive  and  is  necessary  to  maintain  our  technological  preeminence.  It  is  critical  that 
both  our  public  and  business  leaders  focus  on  developing  America’s  innovative  ca-
pacity. It is also critical that the Federal Government support America’s innovative 
capacity.  The  Federal  Government  can  help  ensure  that  the  United  States  main-
tains  the  intellectual  capital  that  catalyzes  innovation,  encourages  workforce  flexi-
bility and life-long learning, and supports entrepreneurship.

Question  3.  The  Kyoto  Protocol  will  become  effective  in  February  2005.  Pursuant 
to  the  treaty,  many  countries  around  the  world  will  be  required  to  reduce  their 
greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  United  States  is  not  a  signatory  to  the  protocol. 
What impact do you believe this treaty will have on the competitiveness of U.S. in-
dustry? 

Answer. I do not have sufficient information on which to make an informed judg-
ment about the relative impact, if any, of the Kyoto Protocol on the competitiveness 
of  U.S.  industry.  I  have  been  advised,  however,  that  the  Bush  Administration’s  ap-
proach  to  greenhouse  gas  reduction  is  to  decrease  emission  intensity—emissions  of 
greenhouse  gas  per  unit  of  economic  productivity—by  18  percent  by  2010.  The  Ad-
ministration  has  challenged  U.S.  businesses  and  industries  to  develop  new  tech-
nologies  to  meet  this  goal,  and  is  supporting  such  efforts  through  the  Climate 
Change  Technology  Program  and  other  means.  I  agree  with  President  Bush’s  view

that a healthy economy—one in which investments in research and development can 
thrive—is  central  to  any  successful  emissions  reduction  strategy.  I  expect  that 
American  businesses  utilizing  cutting-edge  technologies  to  reduce  greenhouse  gases 
and boost energy efficiency will have a competitive edge in the world market.

Question  4.  Last  fall,  SpaceShipOne  won  the  $10  million  Ansari  X-Prize  competi-
tion  for  the  first  privately  funded  group  to  send  three  people  on  a  suborbital  flight 
and repeat the feat within two weeks using the same vehicle. Some believe that this 
event will open a new area of space commerce for suborbital space flights. Also last 
year,  Congress  passed  legislation  authorizing  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration 
to  regulate  these  suborbital  space  launches.  What  are  your  plans  for  the  Depart-
ment of Commerce’s Office of Space Commercialization? 

Answer.  I  expect  that  the  Department  will  continue  to  play  an  important  role  in 
the  development  of  U.S.  Government  policies  that  foster  the  growth  and  competi-
tiveness  of  the  U.S.  commercial  space  industry.  I  understand  that  several  DOC  bu-
reaus  (NOAA,  ITA,  TA,  NTIA,  BIS)  are  and  will  remain  engaged  in  commercial 
space  issues  ranging  from  GPS  to  commercial  remote  sensing,  fair  trade  and  ex-
ports,  space  transportation,  protection  of  space  frequencies,  and  protection  of  the 
U.S.  industrial  base.  I  am  advised  that  pursuant  to  the  FY05  appropriations  bill, 
the  Department  intends  to  integrate  the  Office  of  Space  Commercialization  func-
tions into NOAA. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. CONRAD BURNS TO

CARLOS M. GUTIERREZ 

Timber Industry 

Question  1.  [Submitted  on  behalf  of  Senators  Burns  and  Snowe]  U.S.  timber  in-
dustry jobs and operations, including small mill operators in Montana, rely on effec-
tive  enforcement  of  U.S.  trade  laws,  particularly  against  unfair  Canadian  lumber 
imports.  In  evaluating  the  extent  of  Canadian  timber  subsidies,  for  example,  it  is 
imperative  that  the  Commerce  Department  ascertain  the  true  market  value  of  Ca-
nadian timber in comparison to timber pricing data that reflects full value. Will you 
ensure  full  enforcement  of  the  trade  laws  in  the  softwood  lumber  sector,  including 
selection of accurate subsidy-measurement benchmarks? 

Question 1a. [Submitted on behalf of Senators Burns and Snowe] The unfair trade 
determinations  under  review  by  NAFTA  panels  are  the  original  Commerce  Depart-
ment  and  International  Trade  Commission  final  determinations  issued  at  the  end 
of  countervailing  duty  and  antidumping  duty  investigations  in  2002.  I  understand 
that under U.S. law, the decisions of these NAFTA panels can only have prospective 
effect.  That  is,  their  only  impact  can  be  to  change  the  rates  at  which  duty  deposits 
are collected on imports entering the United States after publication of notice of the 
NAFTA panel decisions. The outcomes of these appeals could not result in the U.S. 
Government  returning  cash  deposits  already  paid  on  Canadian  lumber  imports  or, 
for  that  matter,  collection  of  additional  deposits  on  those  imports.  Can  you  confirm 
that  this  is  your  understanding  as  well?  Furthermore,  can  you  confirm  my  under-
standing that the U.S. Government would be legally forbidden to return duty depos-
its  in  response  to  these  NAFTA  panel  decisions  (apart  from  special  authority  that 
would be available to allocate deposits in the context of settlement of the Canadian 
lumber dispute)? 

Answer.  Yes,  I  will  ensure  full  enforcement  of  the  trade  laws  in  all  respects  and 

in all sectors, including the softwood lumber sector. 

Regarding  the  impact  of  NAFTA  litigation,  I  understand  that  the  Department’s 
position  is  that  the  general  rule  is  that  NAFTA  decisions  only  apply  prospectively. 
There  is  an  exception  to  that  general  rule,  but  it  only  applies  with  respect  to 
NAFTA  decisions  regarding  a  review  of  an  existing  antidumping  or  countervailing 
duty  order,  not  the  original  investigation.  I  have  been  advised  that,  because  that 
exception does not apply to investigations, the Department’s position is that the cur-
rent litigation will not impact pre-judgment imports of lumber. Any assessments or 
refunds of antidumping and countervailing duties on the pre-judgment imports will 
be decided in subsequent administrative reviews by the Department. 
Broadband Deployment 

Question.  Last  year  the  Administration  came  out  with  a  goal  of  universal 
broadband  deployment  by  2007,  and  I  applaud  that.  I  wanted  to  ask  if  you’ve  had 
an  opportunity  to  look  at  the  broadband  expensing  legislation  that  Senator  Rocke-
feller and I have pushed for several years now. I think it could really help us meet 
the 2007 goal. We have passed it through the Senate twice now, but it’s always got-
ten  hung  up  in  the  House.  I  think  your  support  would  make  all  the  difference  in 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  09:43 Nov 14, 2005 Jkt 022734 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22734.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

43

getting  that  legislation  through  the  House.  I  know  tax  legislation  is  not  your  baili-
wick,  but  broadband  deployment  is,  so  I  would  like  to  ask  if  you  and  the  Adminis-
tration in general would reconsider this bill and see if you can support it. 

Answer. As you note in your question, President Bush has articulated a bold new 
vision for broadband in America by setting a national goal for universal and afford-
able  access  to  broadband  by  2007.  I  think  that  this  is  a  very  important  goal,  both 
for  the  Nation  and  on  a  global  scale,  in  terms  of  our  nation’s  competitiveness  and 
it is one that I wholeheartedly endorse and fully support. 

I  have  been  advised  that  although  the  recently  enacted  American  Jobs  Creation 
Act  of  2004  did  not  include  the  broadband  provision  that  you  and  Senator  Rocke-
feller  sponsored,  the  President  signed  the  Jobs  and  Growth  Tax  Reconciliation  Act 
of  2003,  which  included  provisions  that  allow  companies  to  accelerate  depreciation 
of  capital-intensive  broadband  equipment.  I  have  also  been  informed  that  the  Ad-
ministration  has  championed  making  the  research  and  experimentation  tax  credit 
permanent,  and  the  President  has  signed  into  law  an  18-month  extension  of  this 
credit. The President has also supported dramatic increases in funding for research 
and development initiatives. 

I  believe  that  President  Bush  is  dedicated  to  keeping  our  nation  on  the  leading 
edge  of  progress  in  the  21st  century  by  encouraging  entrepreneurship  and  making 
the best technology available to our citizens. If confirmed, I hope to join him in help-
ing to achieve his goal of universal and affordable access to broadband for all Ameri-
cans. I will look forward to working with you and other members of the Committee 
and  the  Congress  on  achieving  the  President’s  goal,  and  I  would  be  willing  to  look 
at your bill and other relevant legislation introduced in the 109th Congress. I would 
also  consult  with  other  members  of  the  Administration  on  this  issue  which  crosses 
a number of departments. 
Agriculture Safeguards 

Question. Perishable and cyclical agricultural products face special needs because 
of  the  perishability  of  the  product.  One  of  the  negotiating  objectives  in  the  Trade 
Act of 2002 was for the U.S. to ensure that special rules were negotiated to address 
the  needs  of  this  sector.  The  Australian  Free  Trade  Agreement  represented  a  posi-
tive  commitment  to  this  objective  by  including  safeguards  for  beef.  Please  indicate 
your  views  on  special  rules  for  perishable  products  and  their  role  in  future  trade 
negotiations. 

Answer.  I  appreciate  the  importance  the  agriculture  community  attaches  to  the 
special issues associated with perishable products, and the role of such issues in fu-
ture  trade  negotiations.  I  also  understand  that  specific  agriculture  safeguard  meas-
ures  with  respect  to  imports  of  beef  and  horticultural  goods  have  been  included  in 
our trade agreements. Since this is an issue that falls primarily under the purview 
of  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  the  U.S.  Trade  Representative,  I  will  be 
pleased to discuss this issue with my colleagues in those agencies if I am confirmed. 
Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) 

Question.  One  program  I  have  been  supportive  of  over  the  years,  within  the  De-
partment of Commerce is the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program. 
Congress appropriated $109 million for this program in FY 2005 and it is doing im-
portant  work  in  Montana  where  we  have  over  2,000  manufacturing  firms.  We  are 
a rural state but we have needs and opportunities that MEP has addressed. For ex-
ample,  our  MEP  Center  helps  companies  understand  costs,  implement  Lean  Manu-
facturing.  I  would  like  to  hear  your  thoughts  on  the  program  and  get  some  assur-
ance your office will work with this Committee and my colleagues on the Appropria-
tions Committee to address the yearly funding struggles we face with the program. 
Answer.  As  someone  who  has  spent  his  professional  career  with  a  U.S.  manufac-
turer, I can assure you that I know how vital a role manufacturers large and small 
play in our economy. The national manufacturing network of the Hollings Manufac-
turing  Extension  Partnership  is  assisting  our  nation’s  small  manufacturers  and 
seeks to contribute to a strong economy. I will work with the members of the Com-
merce and Appropriations Committees to ensure that small manufacturers have ac-
cess to technical and information resources to allow them to remain competitive. 
ICANN and Internet Domain Name Security 

Question 1. What is your view on ICANN as an institution, and how do you think 
its  functioning  could  be  improved,  if  at  all?  Is  it  currently  responsive  enough  to  all 
Internet stakeholders?

Question  1a.  What  is  your  assessment  of  the  White  Paper/Green  Paper  processes 
that  were  initiated  under  former  Clinton  Administration  official  Ira  Magaziner  in 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  09:43 Nov 14, 2005 Jkt 022734 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22734.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

44

the mid-1990s? Do you feel that there was sufficient consultation at that time with 
the Congress regarding the major commitments that were made?

Question 1b. What is the current number of full-time equivalent employees in the 
NTIA  who  monitor  and  participate  in  ICANN  activities?  Given  the  broad  scope  of 
ICANN’s  authority  over  the  Internet  and  the  direct  impact  its  actions  could  have 
on Internet users and businesses, both in the U.S. and abroad, do you feel that this 
is sufficient?

Question 1c. ICANN currently sends regular reports to NTIA in which it outlines 
its  progress  toward  certain  ‘‘milestones’’,  which  are  set  in  ICANN’s  MOU  with  the 
Commerce  Department  and  which  were  initially  outlined  by  the  Magaziner  task 
force.  If  NTIA  feels  all  these  milestones  have  been  met,  according  to  my  under-
standing,  the  MOU  will  be  allowed  to  expire  next  year  and  the  USG  will  have  no 
more  role  in  ICANN  than  any  other  government.  Given  the  USG’s  historic  role  in 
developing,  funding,  and  overseeing  the  Internet,  do  you  feel  the  USG  should  have 
no oversight role at all over the future development and security of the DNS? If not, 
what specific role and/or authority should the USG retain into the future?

Question  1d.  What  is  your  view  on  the  proper  use  of  the  WHOIS  databases,  and 
what is your assessment of current ICANN processes underway regarding WHOIS?
Answer.  I  have  not  had  the  opportunity  to  study  the  history  of  the  Internet  Cor-
poration for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) or its current operations. I un-
derstand  that  the  Department,  through  its  Memorandum  of  Understanding  with 
ICANN,  has  closely  monitored  and  assessed  ICANN’s  evolution  since  its  inception. 
If  confirmed,  I  expect  to  be  briefed  more  fully  and  would  be  pleased  to  discuss 
ICANN issues with you and the Committee.

With regard to the second part of your question, I do not have enough information 
to comment on actions taken by officials in the previous Administration. I do believe 
the Bush Administration has valued its opportunities to consult with Congress, and 
will continue to do so in its second term.

I  am  not  aware  of  the  exact  staffing  levels  devoted  to  ICANN  activities,  but  un-
derstand the Department believes that it devotes sufficient resources within the De-
partment to monitoring and participating in ICANN-related activities. If confirmed, 
I  am  committed  to  ensuring  that  the  Department’s  resources  are  appropriately  fo-
cused on priority issues of importance to the Administration, the Congress, and the 
economy as a whole.

I have been advised that the underlying premise for the creation of ICANN is the 
privatization  of  the  management  of  the  domain  name  system,  and  that  the  MOU 
between  the  Department  and  ICANN  is  structured  to  meet  that  goal.  If  I  am  con-
firmed,  I  expect  to  be  more  fully  briefed  on  this  important  issue,  as  well  as  the 
many other issues related to ICANN and the management of the domain name sys-
tem,  including  the  WHOIS  database,  and  will  be  pleased  to  hold  further  exchanges 
with you and the Committee at a later time. 
Implementation of New E–911 Law 

Question  1.  What  unobligated  or  carry-forward  balances  exist  that  would  permit 

the Department to immediately activate the newly authorized E–911 office?

Question  1a.  How  soon  does  the  Department  plan  to  have  the  Office  staffed  and 

operational?

Question  1b.  How  does  the  Administration  envision  the  Office  operating  and  re-

porting within the Department?

Answer.  I  view  the  recently  enacted  ‘‘Enhance  911  Act  of  2004’’  as  an  important 
piece of legislation intended to move forward the availability of critical E–911 serv-
ices.  I  have  been  informed  that  appropriate  Departmental  personnel  are  currently 
reviewing the requirements under the legislation and evaluating ways to best imple-
ment them. It is my understanding that there were no funds appropriated. I under-
stand  that  Department  of  Commerce  officials  will  be  working  closely  with  the  De-
partment  of  Transportation  to  develop  an  approach  to  fulfill  the  statutory  obliga-
tions of the legislation. 
International Digital Television Outreach 

Question  1.  What  can  the  Commerce  Department  do  to  assist  the  FCC,  industry 
groups and consumers to make the transition to terrestrial digital TV (DTV) broad-
casting more successful in the United States?

Question  1a.  The  U.S.  has  adopted  one  DTV  standard  (ATSC)  and  the  European 
Union  and  several  other  countries  around  the  world  have  adopted  a  different,  in-
compatible  standard  (DVB).  Japan  has  a  third  DTV  standard  still  in  development, 
but  many  developing  countries  are  soon  expected  to  choose  between  the  U.S.  and

45

European  standards.  At  stake  is  the  technology  for  many  millions  of  future  DTV 
sets  and  broadcasting  equipment  around  the  world,  and  the  corresponding  possible 
sales for many of the firms who have been implementing DTV in the U.S. What will 
the  Commerce  Department  do  under  your  leadership  to  advocate  for  the  ATSC 
standard  in  the  near  future?  What  kinds  of  resources  can  you  devote  to  supporting 
and complementing U.S. industry outreach, particularly in Latin America?

Answer.  I  have  been  advised  that  the  President’s  Fiscal  Year  2005  budget  in-
cluded a proposal that would require television broadcasters to begin paying an an-
nual fee for the continued use of analog broadcast spectrum beyond the initial dead-
line.  I  support  this  proposal  and  believe  that  it  is  a  necessary  tool  to  encourage 
broadcasters to transition to digital broadcasting so that recovered analog spectrum 
can  be  used  for  a  number  of  new  wireless  and  public  safety  services.  If  confirmed, 
I  would  look  forward  to  continuing  this  and  other  efforts  to  hasten  the  transition 
to digital television. 

The Administration supports the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) 
standard and has repeatedly advocated its adoption in bilateral dialogs with a num-
ber  of  nations,  including  those  in  Latin  America.  If  confirmed,  I  would  continue  to 
promote  this  standard  through  discussions  with  my  foreign  counterparts.  Addition-
ally,  if  confirmed,  I  will  review  the  Department’s  budget  to  ensure  that  adequate 
resources  are  being  brought  to  bear  to  support  the  adoption  of  this  standard  in  the 
global marketplace.

CARLOS M. GUTIERREZ 

Question  1.  Mr.  Gutierrez,  will  you  pledge  to  me  that,  if  you  are  confirmed,  you 
will  open  the  U.S.  A–TEAM  partnership  to  other  foreign-owned  automotive  manu-
facturers beyond DaimlerChrysler that have invested in a significant U.S. manufac-
turing and R&D presence? 

Answer.  I  have  been  informed  about  the  collaboration  established  by  the  U.S. 
Council  for  Automotive  Research  (USCAR)  and  the  Department  of  Commerce’s 
Technology  Administration  on  December  9,  2004,  that  created  the  U.S.  A–TEAM 
partnership.  I  understand  this  collaboration  was  initiated  over  a  year  ago  by 
USCAR,  the  pre-competitive  research  consortium  of  General  Motors,  Ford  and 
DaimlerChrysler, and thus the collaboration is not with individual auto manufactur-
ers. The Department of Commerce, however, continues to work very closely with all 
American  automotive  manufacturers  and,  we  would  be  open  to  discussions  with 
other companies or organizations interested in establishing similar cooperative man-
ufacturing R&D relationships.

Question  2.  Mr.  Gutierrez,  I  understand  that  the  Department  of  Commerce  is 
working with the U.S. Trade Representative to address problems with China enforc-
ing contracts under the 1958 New York Convention, of which it is a signatory. Many 
U.S.  companies  have  experienced  problems  with  Chinese  companies  not  abiding  by 
contracted  agreements.  If  you  are  confirmed,  will  you  aggressively  confront  this 
problem with China, and any other countries with similar problems? 

Answer.  I  understand  that  the  Bush  Administration  is  committed  to  encouraging 
China  to  strengthen  its  commercial  legal  system,  including  the  need  to  recognize 
and  enforce  foreign  arbitral  awards  under  the  1958  United  Nations  Convention  on 
the  Recognition  and  Enforcement  of  Foreign  Arbitral  Awards.  I  have  been  advised 
that the Commerce Department, through the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Com-
merce and Trade, has long sought to promote commercial law development in China, 
particularly with respect to promoting arbitration and ensuring that arbitral awards 
are  honored.  If  confirmed,  I  intend  to  continue  this  work  and  to  fully  support  U.S. 
companies  in  China,  as  well  as  in  any  other  country  where  they  might  encounter 
similar problems.

Timber Industry 

Question  1.  [Submitted  on  behalf  of  Senators  Burns  and  Snowe]  U.S.  timber  in-
dustry jobs and operations, including small mill operators in Montana, rely on effec-
tive  enforcement  of  U.S.  trade  laws,  particularly  against  unfair  Canadian  lumber 
imports.  In  evaluating  the  extent  of  Canadian  timber  subsidies,  for  example,  it  is 
imperative  that  the  Commerce  Department  ascertain  the  true  market  value  of  Ca-
nadian timber in comparison to timber pricing data that reflects full value. Will you

ensure  full  enforcement  of  the  trade  laws  in  the  softwood  lumber  sector,  including 
selection of accurate subsidy-measurement benchmarks?

46

Question 1a. [Submitted on behalf of Senators Burns and Snowe] The unfair trade 
determinations  under  review  by  NAFTA  panels  are  the  original  Commerce  Depart-
ment  and  International  Trade  Commission  final  determinations  issued  at  the  end 
of  countervailing  duty  and  antidumping  duty  investigations  in  2002.  I  understand 
that under U.S. law, the decisions of these NAFTA panels can only have prospective 
effect.  That  is,  their  only  impact  can  be  to  change  the  rates  at  which  duty  deposits 
are collected on imports entering the United States after publication of notice of the 
NAFTA panel decisions. The outcomes of these appeals could not result in the U.S. 
Government  returning  cash  deposits  already  paid  on  Canadian  lumber  imports  or, 
for  that  matter,  collection  of  additional  deposits  on  those  imports.  Can  you  confirm 
that  this  is  your  understanding  as  well?  Furthermore,  can  you  confirm  my  under-
standing that the U.S. Government would be legally forbidden to return duty depos-
its  in  response  to  these  NAFTA  panel  decisions  (apart  from  special  authority  that 
would be available to allocate deposits in the context of settlement of the Canadian 
lumber dispute)? 

Answer.  Yes,  I  will  ensure  full  enforcement  of  the  trade  laws  in  all  respects  and 

in all sectors, including the softwood lumber sector. 

Regarding  the  impact  of  NAFTA  litigation,  I  understand  that  the  Department’s 
position  is  that  the  general  rule  is  that  NAFTA  decisions  only  apply  prospectively. 
There  is  an  exception  to  that  general  rule,  but  it  only  applies  with  respect  to 
NAFTA  decisions  regarding  a  review  of  an  existing  antidumping  or  countervailing 
duty  order,  not  the  original  investigation.  I  have  been  advised  that,  because  that 
exception does not apply to investigations, the Department’s position is that the cur-
rent litigation will not impact pre-judgment imports of lumber. Any assessments or 
refunds of antidumping and countervailing duties on the pre-judgment imports will 
be decided in subsequent administrative reviews by the Department.

Softwood Lumber 

Question.  As  you  know,  the  lumber  dispute  between  the  United  States  and  Can-
ada is the largest trade case in our history. Four years of well-intentioned work has 
yielded  little  progress  in  bringing  the  dispute  to  a  conclusion.  Do  you  intend  to 
maintain  the  Commerce  Department’s  position  that  duties  collected  on  Canadian 
lumber will not and cannot be returned unless it is part of a negotiated settlement? 

Answer. Yes. 

Piracy 

Question  1.  Mr.  Gutierrez,  America’s  copyright  industries  generate  some  12  per-
cent of GDP and account for over 8 percent of total U.S. employment. The four core 
copyright industries—movies, music, publishing and computer software—account for 
almost  $90  billion  in  foreign  sales  and  exports—more  than  agriculture,  more  than 
automobiles and parts, more than aircraft. How do you intend to protect this signifi-
cant component of our economy in an age when technological theft is so easy? 

Answer. The Bush Administration recognizes the importance of protecting the in-
tellectual  property  of  the  copyright  industries  and  other  U.S.  businesses  and  has 
made  it  a  priority  to  fight  counterfeiting  and  piracy.  Having  spent  a  number  of 
years  with  a  consumer  products  company,  I  fully  recognize  the  value  of  intellectual 
property  assets  and,  if  confirmed,  would  continue  to  give  intellectual  property  pro-
tection priority status. 

Recently, the Department of Commerce helped launch an Administration coopera-
tive  initiative  called  the  Strategy  Targeting  Organized  Piracy  (STOP)  to  combat 
counterfeiting and piracy. If confirmed, I would work with Administration colleagues 
to make that initiative a success. 

In negotiations and consultations with our trading partners, I would place signifi-
cant  emphasis  on  the  need  for  improved  criminal,  civil  and  administrative  enforce-
ment  and  the  need  to  protect  copyright  over  the  Internet  and  promote  accession  to 
the World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) Internet Treaties by all coun-
tries, especially those with a high incidence of piracy. 

In  addition,  if  confirmed,  I  would  work  to  support  the  Administration’s  commit-
ment to vigorously enforce trade laws and agreements and to make sure our trading 
partners comply with their TRIPs (Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellec-
tual  Property  Rights)  obligations.  The  Administration  has  negotiated  and  will  con-

47

tinue  to  negotiate  strong  intellectual  property  provisions  in  all  free  trade  agree-
ments. If confirmed, I would strongly support those efforts.

Question  2.  Copyright  piracy  is  a  huge  problem  in  China  for  our  creative  indus-
tries.  For  the  computer  software  industry,  only  about  8  percent  of  the  software  in-
stalled  in  a  given  year  in  China  is  legally  purchased—much  of  it  by  the  Chinese 
government.  Now  it  seems  that  the  Chinese  government  is  about  to  implement  a 
policy  of  buying  only  Chinese  software.  How  do  you  propose  to  address  these  twin 
market access barriers of piracy and discriminatory procurement policies? 

Answer.  I  understand  that  China’s  top  leadership  has  committed  to  reducing  in-
fringement  of  intellectual  property  rights  (IPR)  in  China  and  that  last  year,  during 
the  U.S.-China  Joint  Commission  on  Commerce  and  Trade  meeting,  China  specifi-
cally  committed  to  extend  its  ban  on  the  use  of  pirated  software  in  central  govern-
ment  and  provincial  agencies  to  include  local  governments.  I  am  advised  that  in 
September 2004, Vice Premier Wu Yi directed that all institutions at the provincial 
level  use  only  legal  software  by  the  end  of  the  year,  and  many  local  governments, 
including  Shanghai,  Beijing,  and  Guangzhou,  have  undertaken  measures  to  ensure 
that  their  agencies  use  only  legal  software.  If  confirmed,  I  will  follow  up  with  Chi-
na’s  leadership  to  ensure  these  commitments  are  honored.  I  also  understand  that, 
for an industry such as software, where U.S. companies either dominate or are com-
petitive  in  nearly  all  segments  of  the  sector,  having  access  to  China’s  government 
procurement market is critical. I understand that the Administration is already ac-
tively engaged with the Chinese Government to encourage China to keep its govern-
ment procurement market open to American firms, and, if confirmed, I will continue 
to press the Chinese leadership on this issue. 
Trade Policy 

Question 1. I understand that China is on the verge of releasing government pro-
curement  regulations  that  will  bar  most  U.S.  software  products  from  the  govern-
ment  market.  What  is  the  Administration’s  position  on  this  issue,  and  what  is  its 
strategy for addressing it? 

Answer. I understand that the Administration has been monitoring China’s devel-
opment  of  its  software  government  procurement  policy  since  the  issue  emerged  in 
early  2003,  and  has  been  actively  engaging  Chinese  leadership  to  encourage  China 
to allow U.S. companies to continue to provide software products and services. I un-
derstand  Secretary  Evans  intends  to  raise  this  issue  with  senior  Chinese  leaders 
when he travels to China this week. This is a priority issue for the Administration, 
and, if confirmed, I will continue to press the Chinese on this issue at senior levels.
Question  2.  Many  nations,  unlike  the  United  States,  have  not  signed  the  WTO 
Agreement  on  Government  Procurement  or  similar  bilateral  trade  agreements  with 
the U.S., which means that these nations are free to exclude U.S. firms from govern-
ment  procurement  contracts.  Even  some  countries  that  have  signed  onto  the  Gov-
ernment Procurement Agreement seek to benefit domestic suppliers over U.S. firms 
indirectly—for  instance,  by  extended  preferences  to  software  firms  that  follow  spe-
cific  development  or  licensing  models,  regardless  of  the  underlying  merits  of  the 
software at issue. As Secretary of Commerce, will you work aggressively to persuade 
United States’ trading partners that such barriers to open and merit-based procure-
ment  undermine  the  principles  of  neutrality  and  non-discrimination  that  are  the 
foundation of international trade? Will you also assure this Committee that you will 
continue  the  Department’s  advocacy  against  software  procurement  preferences  that 
limit competition or are based on factors unrelated to merit? What specific steps will 
you take with respect to China’s efforts to cut off access of U.S. software companies 
to  its  government  procurement  market,  a  development  that  foreshadows  the  exclu-
sion of many other U.S. industries to PRC government procurement? 

Answer.  If  confirmed  as  Secretary  of  Commerce,  I  will  be  aggressive  in  encour-
aging  our  trading  partners  to  adopt  non-discriminatory  approaches  to  government 
procurement  that  conform  to  generally  accepted  international  practices.  I  will  en-
sure  the  Department  continues  to  advocate  for  government  procurement  rules 
whereby  decisions  are  made  based  on  the  principle  of  best  value.  I  will  also  reach 
out to my counterparts in the European Union and Japan, and other countries that 
have  invested  significantly  in  China,  to  encourage  Chinese  Government  leadership 
to  reconsider  their  proposed  software  procurement  policy.  If  confirmed,  I  will  take 
advantage of every opportunity to raise our concerns about China’s government pro-
curement policy with China’s senior leadership.

Question  3.  Technology  innovation  has  been  the  engine  of  American  economic 
growth for years, and America’s innovation industries are leaders in the global econ-
omy.  The  Department  of  Commerce  has  long  been  a  champion  of  American  innova-
tion, and I have no doubt that this will continue under your leadership. Your coun-

48

terparts in other countries, however, may not always perceive U.S. innovation as we 
do  and  may  even  view  U.S.  leadership  in  this  area  as  a  threat  to  their  own  indus-
tries. In particular, there is a risk that other nations may condemn, as anti-competi-
tive,  business  practices  that  from  a  U.S.  perspective  promote  innovation  and  are 
pro-consumer.  As  Secretary  of  Commerce,  would  you  make  it  a  priority  for  the  De-
partment to advance the interests of America’s innovation industries in foreign mar-
kets? Specifically, would you engage actively with other U.S. agencies to ensure that 
our  key  trading  partners  do  not  use  competition  law  to  unfairly  disadvantage  U.S. 
firms in foreign markets? 

Answer.  If  confirmed  as  Secretary  of  Commerce,  I  am  committed  to  maintaining 
the  competitiveness  of  America’s  technology  innovation  industries.  Advancing  those 
industries’  interests  in  foreign  markets  will  be  on  my  agenda.  I  will  work  with  my 
colleagues in the Administration as well as our trading partners to ensure that com-
petition laws are not used to disadvantage American firms in foreign markets.

Question 4. As you know, China has a huge trade surplus with the United States. 
China’s  Premier  has  stated  that  China  will  reduce  this  surplus  by  importing  more 
American  products.  Yet  it  appears  that  the  Chinese  Government  is  about  to  throw 
up a new barrier to market access for one of our most competitive exports by requir-
ing government ministries to purchase only Chinese software. What will the Depart-
ment of Commerce do, under your leadership, to hold China to its word? 

Answer. I understand that the Administration has been monitoring China’s devel-
opment  of  its  software  government  procurement  policy  since  the  issue  emerged  in 
early  2003,  and  has  been  actively  engaging  Chinese  leadership  to  encourage  China 
to  allow  U.S.  companies  to  continue  to  provide  software  products  and  services.  Sec-
retary Evans intends to raise this issue with senior Chinese leaders when he travels 
to  China  during  this  week.  This  is  a  priority  issue  for  the  Administration,  and,  if 
confirmed, I will continue to press the Chinese on this issue at senior levels. 
Columbia River Issues 

Question 1. You are aware of the importance of the Federal Columbia River Power 
System to the economy of the Pacific Northwest as it provides transportation, irriga-
tion, flood control, and almost one-half of the electricity used in the region. The De-
partment of Commerce (NOAA Fisheries) plays an enormous role in how this system 
is  managed.  As  you  oversee  the  Department’s  role  in  managing  the  Fisheries  and 
Endangered Species Act aspects of salmon and steelhead policy, how will you ensure 
that  the  Department  adequately  considers  the  impacts  of  those  policies  on  farmers, 
ranchers, and electricity ratepayers in the Northwest? 

Answer.  I  am  aware  that  NOAA  Fisheries,  in  conjunction  with  the  Bonneville 
Power Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers, plays a key role in the op-
eration  of  the  Federal  Columbia  River  Power  System.  The  existence  of  the  dams 
that make up this system contribute significantly to the economic foundation of the 
Pacific Northwest by providing electric power generation, navigation, irrigation, and 
flood  control.  I  understand  that  great  attention  is  warranted  as  we  attempt  to  bal-
ance  the  needs  of  listed  salmon  and  steelhead  with  the  operation  of  a  hydropower 
system. Should I be confirmed, I will work diligently to ensure that decisions made 
by  the  Department  of  Commerce  give  adequate  consideration  to  all  of  the  region’s 
stakeholders,  including  farmers,  ranchers,  and  the  electricity  ratepayers  you  men-
tioned.

Question 2. NOAA Fisheries is responsible for developing recovery plans for ESA-
listed  fish  in  the  Northwest  that  take  into  account  impacts  to  the  fish  beyond  the 
narrow  focus  of  the  hydropower  system  (many  factors  such  as  harvest,  hatcheries 
and habitat play a large role). NOAA expects to issue these plans by the end of the 
year. Is this pace realistic, and can you please give details regarding whether there 
is adequate funding allocated to this effort? 

Answer.  I  understand  that  NOAA  Fisheries  has  been  working  collaboratively  at 
the  local  level,  including  through  the  Northwest  Power  Planning  and  Conservation 
Council’s  sub-basin  planning  process  to  develop  and  acquire  the  information  nec-
essary to issue recovery plans for ESA-listed fish. Nevertheless, I am unable to com-
ment  specifically  on  the  efficacy  of  the  timelines  you  mention  until  I  have  time  to 
become  familiar  with  the  details  of  this  process.  With  respect  to  your  question  re-
garding funding for this effort, the President’s FY 2006 Budget is in its final stages 
of  review  and  will  be  released  in  February.  Should  I  be  confirmed,  I  would  be 
pleased  to  have  additional  discussions  with  you  about  these  issues  after  the  Presi-
dent’s Budget request is submitted to the Congress.

Question 3. For several years, salmon and steelhead have returned to the Colum-
bia River in record numbers. Does NOAA Fisheries have a clear definition for what 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  09:43 Nov 14, 2005 Jkt 022734 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22734.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

49

constitutes numerical ‘‘recovery’’ of these runs? If so, please elaborate on that defini-
tion. Also, please describe the status of any pending de-listing determinations. 

Answer.  I  am  still  working  to  educate  myself  on  the  particulars  of  many  NOAA 
issues,  notably  the  complexities  of  salmon  policy.  Nevertheless,  I  understand  the 
critical importance of recognizing what defines ‘‘recovery’’ and that this issue is one 
that  will  continue  to  dominate  the  salmon  policy  debate.  If  confirmed,  I  will  work 
with  NOAA  Fisheries  to  ensure  that  realistic  recovery  targets  are  developed  as  ex-
peditiously  as  possible.  With  respect  to  your  question  regarding  pending  de-listing 
determinations, I am unable to comment until I have more time to become familiar 
with NOAA’s work on this issue.
Klamath Basin Issues 

Question 1. One of the pressing issues in southern Oregon and northern California 
concerns the Klamath Project and NOAA Fisheries biological opinions for coho salm-
on in the Klamath River. In 2001, a NOAA Fisheries biological opinion was largely 
responsible  for  cutting  off  water  to  family  farms  and  wildlife  refuges  that  depend 
on  water  supplied  through  the  federal  Klamath  Project.  As  a  result  of  an  inde-
pendent review of that opinion by the National Research Council we now know that 
the requirement for higher flows was not backed by science or existing data. At the 
same  time,  there  remains  in  place  a  biological  opinion  that  calls  for  high  Klamath 
River flows, to be achieved to a large degree by idling productive farmland and tax-
ing  groundwater  supplies.  It  is  my  understanding  that  the  Bureau  of  Reclamation 
and NOAA Fisheries will complete a new ESA consultation for the Klamath Project 
and  coho  salmon  before  the  2006  irrigation  season.  Will  you  provide  me  with  the 
anticipated  schedule  for  that  consultation  and  a  description  of  the  role  that  will  be 
played by the affected water users in the Klamath Project?

Question  1a.  The  report  of  the  National  Research  Council  makes  it  abundantly 
clear  that  in  the  recent  past  there  has  been  an  ineffective  emphasis  on  regulating 
the  Klamath  Project  water  supply  as  a  means  to  attempt  to  benefit  coho  in  the 
mainstem  Klamath  River.  Will  you  provide  me  with  information  on  how  NOAA 
Fisheries and the Bureau of Reclamation will go about achieving a more appropriate 
and  equitable  approach  to  addressing  the  coho  in  the  Klamath  Basin,  including 
avoidance of land idling and excessive groundwater pumping as tools?

Question 1b. It is my understanding that in past consultations the Bureau of Rec-
lamation  and  NOAA  Fisheries  have  taken  different  conceptual  approaches  to  the 
analysis of impacts to coho resulting from Klamath Project operations. In particular, 
they have apparently not agreed on how one is to identify or characterize the ‘‘envi-
ronmental  baseline’’  that  is  a  critical  element  in  ultimately  identifying  impacts  of 
a  federal  action.  It  seems  highly  appropriate  that  your  agency  and  the  Bureau  of 
Reclamation  resolve  this  issue  well  in  advance  of  the  consultation  itself.  Will  you 
pursue  an  effort  to  resolve  any  such  areas  of  disagreement  and  provide  me  with  a 
schedule and process for doing so? 

Answer.  I  recognize  the  importance  of  the  issues  you  raised  regarding  the  Klam-
ath  Basin.  I  am  also  aware  that  balancing  the  water  needs  in  the  Basin  has  been 
a  priority  of  this  Administration.  I  am  advised  that  is  why,  in  early  March  2002, 
the President created the Klamath River Basin Working Group of which the Depart-
ment of Commerce is a member. I understand that Working Group has worked dili-
gently  to  coordinate  federal  efforts  within  the  Basin.  Should  I  be  confirmed,  I  will 
work closely with you and your colleagues in the region to ensure the concerns you 
raise are given every consideration by NOAA. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. GEORGE ALLEN TO

CARLOS M. GUTIERREZ 

Question 1. I am interested in how you view your responsibilities under our Trade 
laws with respect to administering dumping cases against the Chinese. It is my un-
derstanding  that  dumping  cases  against  Chinese  firms  have  reached  such  signifi-
cant volume that the Office of Import Administration has created a special office for 
the dispensation of these cases. At the same time, I am concerned that there is often 
a lack of appreciation for the quality and accuracy of data used to measure the costs 
of  Chinese  firms.  This  is  often  to  the  detriment  of  U.S.  manufacturers  in  these 
cases. I was pleased to see that in the House Report accompanying the Consolidated 
Appropriations  Act  there  was  language  that  emphasizes  the  need  to  utilize  ‘‘surro-
gate’’ data from market economies that more accurately reflects the costs of Chinese 
production.  This  I  believe  would  reverse  a  disturbing  trend  toward  ‘‘zeroing’’  out 
U.S. firms in China. Can you provide me with an indication of your intentions with 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  09:43 Nov 14, 2005 Jkt 022734 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22734.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

50

respect  to  how  these  cases  that  so  directly  affect  U.S.  jobs  can  be  fairly  adminis-
tered? 

Answer. I fully appreciate the seriousness of the disputes involving unfairly trad-
ed products from the People’s Republic of China that are entering the United States. 
I  understand  that  the  Commerce  Department  has  aggressively  enforced  applicable 
trade laws against unfairly traded products from China, and, if I am confirmed, the 
Department will continue to do so under my leadership. I am informed that the De-
partment  has  recently  published  antidumping  duty  orders  on  color  televisions  and 
wooden bedroom furniture from China, and has reached an affirmative dumping de-
termination  on  certain  canned  and  frozen  shrimp  from  China.  I  understand  that, 
since  2001,  the  Commerce  Department  has  published  24  antidumping  duty  orders 
on  products  from  China,  and  that  over  the  last  four  years  the  number  of  investiga-
tions initiated and antidumping orders put into place by the Commerce Department 
against products from China is approximately two times greater than the next lead-
ing country. 

Further, I am informed that the Department’s enforcement of the U.S. trade laws 
against unfairly traded products from China has recently been strengthened by the 
creation  of  the  Office  of  China  Compliance  within  the  Commerce  Department’s  Im-
port Administration. This office has a large staff of individuals with methodological, 
language,  accounting  and  computer  programming  expertise  in  the  conduct  of  anti-
dumping  investigations  involving  non-market  economy  countries,  of  which  China  is 
the largest. I understand that, consistent with the law, it is the Department’s prac-
tice  to  use  surrogates  from  market  economy  countries  in  all  proceedings  involving 
non-market  economy  countries  such  as  China.  I  am  advised  that  the  Department 
will continue to evaluate the usefulness and reliability of these surrogate values on 
a case-by-case basis and will modify or update them as appropriate. 

Finally, I understand that the Import Administration is also in the process of re-
viewing  the  Department’s  practices  in  conducting  antidumping  proceedings  involv-
ing non-market economy countries. If confirmed as Secretary, I will ensure that this 
review  continues.  I  will  also  direct  the  Import  Administration  to  continue  with  its 
program  of  pro-active  measures  to  identify  and  address  unfair  trade  practices  and 
policies at their source, including continuing to monitor the 30 largest categories of 
imports  from  China  with  the  goal  of  identifying  unfairly  traded  goods  and,  where 
warranted, resolving the problems before domestic industries are injured.

Question 2. One of our most longstanding trade issues involves imports of cement 
from Mexico, which are covered by a U.S. antidumping order. This case is an exam-
ple of why we need strong enforcement of laws against unfairly priced imports. Un-
like U.S. cement producers, Mexican producers have a home market in Mexico that 
is closed to any outside competition, allowing them to earn high profits by charging 
among the highest cement prices in the world to Mexican customers. They use their 
high  profits  from  home  market  sales  in  Mexico  to  subsidize  their  exports  to  the 
United  States  at  unfairly  low  prices.  Without  an  antidumping  order  in  place,  im-
ports  from  Mexico  would  injure  U.S.  producers  and  impede  investment  in  new  ce-
ment capacity in the United States. Can you assure us that, under your leadership, 
the  Department  of  Commerce  will  be  aggressive  in  enforcing  U.S.  laws  against  un-
fairly traded imports from all countries? 

Answer.  I  have  been  informed  that  the  antidumping  duty  order  on  cement  from 
Mexico  has  been  in  place  for  many  years,  and  that  the  Commerce  Department  has 
conducted  numerous  annual  administrative  reviews  of  the  order.  These  reviews 
have  helped  ensure  that  the  amount  of  dumping  occurring  is  measured  in  a  timely 
manner,  and  that  the  appropriate  amount  of  duties  are  collected  so  that  these  im-
ports  do  not  continue  to  injure  domestic  producers.  If  I  am  confirmed  as  the  Sec-
retary of Commerce, I will ensure that the Department continues to work vigorously 
to  ensure  that  domestic  industries  are  not  injured  by  unfairly  traded  imports,  in-
cluding imports of cement from Mexico. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO

CARLOS M. GUTIERREZ 

Question  1.  Importance  of  NOAA  in  Commerce  Department.  NOAA’s  2005 
budget  of  $3.9  billion  will  represent  more  than  60  percent  of  the  Department  of 
Commerce’s  budget.  In  fact,  this  is  the  largest  budget  ever  given  to  NOAA.  How-
ever,  past  Secretaries  of  Commerce  have  not  given  NOAA  the  attention  or  priority 
that  it  deserves  with  respect  to  oceanic  and  atmospheric  issues.  How  do  you  see 
NOAA’s role within the Department under your direction?

Question  1a.  What  kind  of  support  can  we  expect  to  see  for  NOAA  and  its  mis-

sions?

Answer.  NOAA  is  the  largest  bureau  within  the  Department  of  Commerce,  and 
with  responsibilities  of  exceptional  importance  to  our  economy,  public  safety,  and 
marine  environment,  I  take  NOAA’s  mission  very  seriously.  Recent  world  events 
have  made  it  clear  to  everyone  just  how  important  is  that  the  work  that  the  sci-
entists and managers of NOAA do every day. In speaking with members of the Com-
mittee,  they  have  impressed  upon  me  the  depth  and  breadth  of  issues  NOAA  han-
dles.

Question  2.  NOAA  Funding  Needs.  The  U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy  rec-
ommended up to a $4 billion increase in funding for ocean programs—from fisheries 
to  exploration  and  mapping.  The  importance  of  capitalizing,  maintaining  and  per-
haps  expanding  many  of  these  critical  NOAA  programs—including  the  Pacific  Tsu-
nami Warning System—has become all too apparent as the press reports on natural 
disasters, climate change, marine mammal die-offs, oil spills, and the like. What are 
your plans for the agency’s budget, given these emerging fiscal needs? 

Answer.  The  Administration  is  still  developing  the  FY  2006  budget,  and  while  I 
have  not  been  involved  in  that  process,  I  expect  it  will  reflect  the  President’s  com-
mitment to sound ocean policy. For example, I have been informed that the Admin-
istration  has  already  announced  that  it  will  be  requesting  $2.7  million  to  support 
state and local coral conservation efforts to implement local action strategies devel-
oped by the states, territories and commonwealths that make up the U.S. Coral Reef 
Task Force. 

On December 17, 2004, the President released the Administration’s reponse to the 
U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy,  the  ‘‘U.S.  Ocean  Action  Plan.’’  As  noted  in  the 
NOAA statement from Admiral Lautenbacher on the release of the Administration’s 
Plan, ‘‘this is a commitment we are making not just for the short term. We can look 
no  further  than  the  President’s  commitment  to  promote  lifelong  ocean  education  as 
a  sign  that  the  Ocean  Commission  will  have  an  impact  for  generations  to  come.’’
Question  2a.  Do  you  foresee  a  significant  increase  as  recommended  by  the  Com-

mission, or do you see the budget operating at the status quo? 

Answer.  I  expect  to  testify  before  the  Senate  Appropriations  Committee  after  the 
President’s FY 2006 budget is released in early February, and look forward to work-
ing with the Congress on NOAA funding needs.

Question 3. NOAA Management Changes. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Pol-
icy  also  recommended  management  changes  for  NOAA,  such  as  the  integration  of 
six line offices, establishing an integrated regional presence (i.e., in the Western Pa-
cific), moving programs from other agencies, and substantial improvements in exist-
ing programs. Can you please tell us how you plan to address the Commission’s rec-
ommendations relating to the restructuring of NOAA? 

Answer.  I  have  been  advised  that  the  U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy  rec-
ommended a phased approach to strengthening NOAA. The first recommended step 
is the passage of an organic act codifying NOAA’s existence and mission within the 
Department of Commerce. Secretary Evans transmitted such a proposal to Congress 
last June. The next phase would be a review of the various recommendations relat-
ing to agency institutional structures and consolidation. It is my understanding that 
the President has tasked the new interagency Committee on Ocean Policy with this 
review. If confirmed as Secretary, I would serve on this Cabinet-level committee. 

I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  meet  with  VADM  Lautenbacher,  Under  Secretary 
of  Commerce  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere,  to  discuss  the  activities  and  structure  of 
NOAA.  He  briefly  reviewed  the  organizational  changes  that  have  already  occurred 
to  integrate  the  activities  of  the  Line  Offices.  I  hope  to  bring  my  own  management 
experience  to  further  discussions  within  the  Administration  and  with  Members  of 
Congress about how to build upon these improvements.

Question  4.  Opportunities  for  Strengthening  both  Commerce  and  NOAA. 
There  has  been  widespread  support,  from  the  U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy, 
former NOAA Administrators, ocean policy experts, and this very Committee, to pro-
viding  NOAA  more  budgetary  and  programmatic  independence  from  the  Depart-
ment  of  Commerce—and  ultimately  full  independence.  NOAA’s  budget  growth,  and 
the  continuing  need  for  increased  funding,  indicates  that  the  agency  may  have 
reached  a  funding  ceiling  within  the  Department.  This  poses  a  problem  for  both 
NOAA  and  the  Department.  As  Secretary,  will  you  give  consideration  to  this  idea 
that NOAA should be more independent, and that a transition to independence may 
in turn present an opportunity to strengthen the Department of Commerce by focus-
ing more on trade and business? 

Answer. If confirmed as the Secretary of Commerce, I will certainly be examining 
all  of  the  Department’s  operations  with  an  eye  towards  identifying  ways  to  make 
each  operating  unit  more  efficient  and  effective.  Knowing  the  particular  interests 
that  many  members  of  Congress  have  in  NOAA,  I  will  pay  special  attention  to  the

52

many  ideas  that  have  been  raised  about  NOAA’s  current  structure.  I  should  note, 
however,  that  based  upon  my  experience  as  a  CEO,  I  frankly  would  be  skeptical 
about  any  proposal  that  would  make  the  Secretary  responsible  for  an  organization 
for which he lacks budgetary and personnel authority.

Question  5.  Implementing  U.S.  Ocean  Commission  Recommendations.  As 
Secretary of Commerce, you will have significant responsibility for implementing the 
recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. As you know, the Presi-
dent responded to these recommendations in December of 2004 with the U.S. Ocean 
Action Plan. Do you believe that this Action Plan adequately addresses the Commis-
sion’s recommendations?

Question 5a. Will the President’s proposal to establish an interagency Ocean Com-
mittee  within  CEQ  undermine  the  existing  authority  of  the  Department  of  Com-
merce and NOAA as the expert civilian ocean agency?

Question  5b.  What  other  initiatives  do  you  plan  to  support  at  NOAA  in  order  to 

expand its role in oceanic and atmospheric management?

Answer. The President’s U.S. Ocean Action Plan outlines some immediate actions 
as well as a process and structure for addressing the other recommendations of the 
U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy’s  report.  I  have  been  informed  that  the  Commis-
sion’s  report  included  over  200  recommendations.  I  look  forward  to  learning  more 
about the report and would expect to be actively engaged in the new Committee on 
Ocean Policy. I anticipate that the increased attention to these important issues will 
enhance,  not  undermine,  the  existing  authorities  of  the  Department  and  NOAA.  If 
confirmed,  I  will  be  working  closely  with  NOAA  leadership  to  improve  oceanic  and 
atmospheric science and management activities.

Question  6.  Hollings  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership.  The  Hollings 
Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) supports a network of locally-run cen-
ters that provide technical advice and consulting to small manufacturing companies 
in  all  fifty  states  and  Puerto  Rico.  Many  of  these  firms  lag  behind  foreign  competi-
tors in technology and operations, leading larger American firms to look increasingly 
for  offshore  suppliers.  MEP-assisted  companies  surveyed  reported  $2.79  billion  in 
new or retained sales, $681 million in cost savings, and $940 million in new invest-
ment  in  FY  2002.  During  that  period,  these  firms  created  or  retained  41,017  jobs 
that otherwise might have been lost. For the past two years, the Administration has 
proposed supporting only the MEP office at NIST and withdrawing support from the 
centers  around  the  country  that  directly  provide  these  valuable  services  to  small 
manufacturers.  While  Congress  has  restored  full  funding  for  MEP,  I  understand 
that  OMB  has  once  again  recommended  this  program  for  elimination  in  FY  2006. 
You  have  pledged  to  help  small  businesses  like  the  small  manufacturers  that  MEP 
helps.  Can  you  assure  me  that,  if  confirmed,  you  will  do  everything  in  your  power 
to ensure full funding for this important and successful program? 

Answer.  Coming  from  a  Michigan-based  manufacturer,  I  am  aware  of  the  impor-
tance  of  manufacturing  to  the  economy.  If  confirmed  as  Secretary  of  Commerce,  I 
will support our nation’s manufacturers in their efforts to become more competitive 
and  productive  in  the  global  marketplace.  I  have  been  advised  that  the  national 
manufacturing  network  of  the  Hollings  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  has 
assisted  small  manufacturers  and  has  demonstrated  potential  for  assisting  other 
federal  agencies  in  meeting  their  missions.  I  will  make  every  effort  to  ensure  that 
small  manufacturers  have  access  to  technical  and  information  resources  to  allow 
them to remain competitive.

Question  7.  Advanced  Technology  Program.  The  Advanced  Technology  Pro-
gram  (ATP)  is  an  industry-led,  competitive,  and  cost-shared  program  that  allows 
U.S.  companies  to  develop  the  next  generation  of  breakthrough  technologies.  These 
new innovations enable the U.S. to aggressively compete against foreign rivals. The 
National  Academy  of  Science  has  found  it  to  be  an  effective  program  which  could 
use  more  funding  wisely.  ATP  is  funding  research  ranging  from  cancer  vaccines  to 
hi-tech  flexible  displays  to  composite  materials.  These  are  the  kinds  of  ground 
breaking  technologies  that  provide  the  country  a  competitive  advantage.  Yet,  the 
Administration  has  moved  to  eliminate  this  program.  What  can  you  do  to  help  me 
revive ATP? 

Answer.  I  understand  that  the  Advanced  Technology  Program  has  sponsored  nu-
merous successful research projects over the years, but that scarce federal resources 
caused  by  the  need  to  fight  the  war  on  terrorism  and  protect  the  homeland  have 
forced  the  Administration  and  the  Congress  to  make  difficult  budget  choices  affect-
ing  ATP  and  other  programs.  As  a  businessman,  I  can  appreciate  the  need  to  set 
priorities and to watch the bottom line.

53

I  also  appreciate  the  need  for  our  industries  to  stay  competitive  in  a  global  econ-
omy, and I believe that it is important to look at initiatives that offer benefits broad-
ly serving all U.S. businesses. For instance, the President’s Manufacturing Initiative 
sets out a plan to reduce the cost and complexity of the tax code, making tax relief 
permanent, and lowering health care, energy, and legal costs.

Question 7a. In the absence of a program like ATP that fills the gap between basic 
R&D and a project ready for venture funding, how will the government ensure that 
we don’t just win Nobel Prizes but also win the profits that go with them? 

Answer. As someone who has worked in manufacturing in my professional career, 
I  believe  that  the  U.S.  continues  to  enjoy  a  competitive  advantage  in  the  manufac-
turing sector. We have some of the best factories in the world with technologies and 
supply chain systems that give us the ability to use manufacturing more efficiently 
than  our  competition  abroad.  I  agree  that  we  need  to  not  only  develop  but  also  im-
plement  technologies  into  the  factory.  We  can  also  support  our  federal  technology 
transfer  structure  in  order  to  move  new  technology  from  the  laboratories  into  the 
commercial marketplace.

Question 8. Patent. We hear a lot of back and forth about the backlog in the Pat-
ent Office. For FY 2005, Congress has provided an additional $342 million over the 
FY 2004 level for the patent office. What will it take to reduce the backlog and have 
the Patent Office operate more efficiently? 

Answer.  I  have  been  advised  that  the  USPTO,  at  Congress’  direction,  developed 
a  21st  Century  Strategic  Plan  to  not  only  increase  productivity  in  processing  time 
but  also  to  enhance  quality  and  promote  electronic  filing  and  processing.  The  Plan 
has  the  backing  of  a  wide  range  of  businesses,  industries  and  trade  groups.  If  con-
firmed, I would work with the Director of the USPTO to ensure that the initiatives 
in the Plan are fully funded and implemented in a timely manner. 

Since  implementation  of  the  majority  of  the  Plan’s  initiatives  is  contingent  upon 
adoption  of  changes  in  the  fee  system  that  are  contained  in  the  United  States  Pat-
ent  and  Trademark  Fee  Modernization  Act,  if  confirmed,  I  would  work  with  Con-
gress  to  make  those  adjustments  permanent.  To  ensure  effective  implementation  of 
the USPTO’s strategic plan, we should work toward certainty in achieving stability 
and certainty in the USPTO’s access to future revenues.

Question  8a.  Are  you  able  to  find  the  kind  of  folks—educated  in  both  technology 

and the law—that you need to fill the new positions you intend to create? 

Answer.  My  understanding  is  that  the  USPTO  has  been  successful  in  attracting, 
hiring  and  retaining  personnel  with  high  levels  of  education  and  professionalism. 
While private sector competition in certain ‘‘hot’’ areas such as communications and 
electronics  has  been  a  challenge,  the  opportunity  for  public  service,  flexible  work 
schedules,  telecommuting  opportunities,  enhanced  pay  and  pro-family  and  life  style 
benefits the USPTO offers are highly valued by employees and job applicants.

Question  9.  Technology Transfer.  What  is  your  evaluation  of  the  nation’s  tech-
nology  transfer  policy?  How  can  we  improve  our  system  for  getting  inventions  out 
of the labs and onto production lines? 

Answer.  The  new  knowledge  and  technologies  that  flow  from  U.S.  research  uni-
versities  and  federal  laboratories,  supported  in  large  part  by  federally-funded  R&D 
dollars, are key aspects of the Nation’s overall innovation system. Effectively trans-
ferring and harnessing new technology and know-how in order to create commercial 
products  and  new  business  opportunities  has  been  strategically  important  for  my 
past industry—as it has been for many other industry sectors. 

The  Commerce  Department,  through  the  Technology  Administration,  leads  our 
nation’s federal technology transfer efforts. I understand that the President’s Coun-
cil  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Technology  (PCAST)  reviewed  the  Nation’s  federal 
technology  transfer  structure  in  2003  and  made  recommendations  to  improve  upon 
the  successful  system  we  already  have.  I  would  be  pleased  to  work  with  the  Con-
gress to identify high priority Commerce initiatives to support innovation and tech-
nology transfer.

Question  10.  Space  Commercialization.  When  SpaceShipOne  won  the  X-Prize 
last  year  by  becoming  the  first  privately-funded  aircraft  to  visit  and  return  from 
space, many had high hopes for a revitalized U.S. space commerce sector. Yet, your 
Department’s  Office  of  Space  Commercialization  is  moribund,  at  best.  Under  your 
leadership, what role will the Department play in promoting space commerce? 

Answer.  The  Department  has  played  and  will  continue  to  play  a  key  role  in  the 
development of U.S. Government policies that foster the growth and competitiveness 
of  the  U.S.  commercial  space  industry.  It  serves  as  an  advocate  for  the  industry 
within  interagency  deliberations  affecting  the  future  of  space,  encouraging  the  pro-
motion of commercial interests as well as national security, foreign policy, and other 
interests. The Department will remain engaged in commercial space issues ranging

from  GPS  to  commercial  remote  sensing,  fair  trade  and  exports,  space  transpor-
tation,  protection  of  space  frequencies,  and  protection  of  the  U.S.  industrial  base.
Question  10a.  Do  you  intend  to  appoint  a  Director  of  Space  Commercialization? 
Answer. Yes.
Question  10b.  Virgin  airways  intended  to  invest  a  significant  amount  in  the  nas-
cent  space  tourism  business,  specifically  in  the  company  which  flew  SpaceShipOne 
to  the  X-prize.  In  the  aviation  world,  our  airlines  have  always  faced  restrictions  on 
foreign ownership. Given the strategic, as well as economic, importance of the poten-
tial  private,  commercial  space  launch  business,  should  we  consider  foreign-owner-
ship restrictions similar to those imposed on the airlines?

Answer.  I  agree  that  the  U.S.  commercial  space  launch  industry  is  of  great  stra-
tegic and economic importance to the United States. To the extent foreign ownership 
in this industry may become an issue, I understand that laws are currently in place 
that  can  effectively  address  it.  Proposed  transactions  involving  foreign  ownership 
and  control  in  our  domestic  industry  would  likely  require  review  by  the  Committee 
on  Foreign  Investment  in  the  United  States  (CFIUS),  chaired  by  the  Treasury  De-
partment,  under  the  Exon-Florio  provision  of  the  Omnibus  Trade  and  Competitive-
ness Act of 1988. I understand that the Department of Commerce is an active mem-
ber  of  this  committee,  and  that  CFIUS  regularly  reviews  proposed  foreign  acquisi-
tions  of  U.S.  companies  to  ensure  that  U.S.  interests,  such  as  technological  leader-
ship  in  areas  affecting  U.S.  national  security,  are  not  compromised  by  the  trans-
action.

Question 11. Census. The 2000 Census missed about 6 million Americans, accord-
ing to adjusted Census data that the Department was forced to release. How do you 
plan to ensure that the Census counts all Americans? 

Answer.  It  is  my  understanding  that  Congress  has  approved  and  funded  a  short-
form-only  2010  census.  The  Census  Bureau  will  be  able  to  focus  every  resource  on 
the  Constitutional  mandate  of  counting  all  the  people.  The  collection  of  detailed 
characteristics  data,  performed  once  a  decade  on  the  long  form  and  constituting  60 
percent  of  the  workload,  will  now  occur  every  year  through  the  American  Commu-
nity Survey (ACS). I am advised that the ACS will provide better and more current 
data  and  reduce  peak  work  load  spikes.  Re-engineering  the  short  form  will  use  the 
latest  technology  and  methodologies  and  re-engineering  the  Master  Address  lists 
will provide greater accuracy.

Question  11a.  Will  scientific  adjustment  of  the  data,  known  as  ‘‘sampling,’’  be  on 

the table if you are confirmed? 

Answer.  I  am  advised  that  the  Director  of  the  Census  Bureau  has  informed  Con-
gress that the Census Bureau is not seeking any funds for planning or implementa-
tion of statistical adjustment in the 2010 Census. 

In  November  2004,  the  GAO  issued  a  report  entitled  ‘‘Census  Bureau  Needs  to 
Accelerate Efforts to Develop and Implement Data Quality Review Standards.’’ The 
report  built  on  earlier  GAO  work  examining  flaws  in  2000  Census  data  reporting 
the  Hispanic  and  the  homeless  populations.  The  report  says  that  standards  were 
never  in  place  to  assess  data  quality  in  2000.  Furthermore,  the  report  states  that 
while  limited  improvements  and  standards  have  been  implemented  since  then,  the 
Bureau must accelerate its efforts to review data quality and implement new stand-
ards in time for the 2010 Census.

Question 11b. What steps will you take as Secretary to accelerate this process and 

Data quality? 

bring it more in to the open? 

Answer. I am advised that the Census Bureau has responded to the GAO Report 
and is writing an action plan to be submitted by the end of January to address the 
GAO recommendations.

Question 11c. Do you intend to follow GAO’s recommendations to improve Census 

Answer.  I  have  studied  neither  the  report  nor  the  response.  I  have  confidence  in 
the  professionalism  of  the  Census  Bureau  and  understand  that  the  Bureau  has  a 
long history of continuously improving data quality in a transparent, comprehensive 
process. 

The Census Bureau is now sharing information with the Department of Homeland 
Security breaking down the Arab population by zip code and with the Mexican gov-
ernment  to  allow  them  to  better  assess  and  tax  the  value  of  U.S.  exports.  Some 
worry  that  this  kind  of  data  sharing  will  effect  the  quality  of  Census  data  because 
Americans and American businesses will become reluctant to share data that could 
be used for law enforcement or taxation purposes.

Question 11d. What is your reaction to this kind of data sharing?

Answer.  I  am  advised  that  the  Census  Bureau  responded  to  one  request  for  pub-
licly  available  data  from  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  just  as  it  would 
have to any other requester. I also am advised that the Census Bureau and the De-
partment of Homeland Security, after consultation with U.S. industry, have entered 
into  a  limited  agreement  with  Mexican  law  enforcement  authorities  that  permits 
these  authorities  to  request  verification  within  broad  ranges  of  export  value  data 
being  reported  by  exporters  to  both  governments.  Like  the  Census  Bureau  profes-
sionals,  I  am  committed  to  the  protection  of  individual  and  business  data  as  pro-
vided  by  law.  Federal  law  provides  heavy  fines  and  imprisonment  for  any  breach 
of privacy, although I understand none occurred in either case you mentioned. I will 
be vigilant against any violation of the law.

Question  12.  The  Economy,  the  Workforce,  and  Jobs.  Do  you  believe  that 
outsourcing  is  a  problem  for  the  United  States?  If  so,  what  can  we  do  to  keep  jobs 
in America? 

Answer.  I  understand  that  of  all  the  major  U.S.  layoffs  in  the  past  three  years, 
only  a  small  fraction—about  2  percent—were  due  to  overseas  relocation  of  jobs. 
While  losing  a  job  is  always  traumatic,  to  create  and  keep  jobs  here  in  the  United 
States, American workers must remain the best qualified and most productive. Edu-
cation  is  the  key.  We  have  to  have  our  youngest  students  ready  to  learn.  We  need 
to encourage excellence in math and science. We need to train our young people for 
tomorrow’s jobs and offer retraining to experienced workers. 

The  President  and  the  Congress  have  a  role,  too,  to  help  businesses  cut  costs. 
Working  together,  the  Executive  and  Legislative  Branches  of  government  can  help 
businesses  get  control  of  health  care  costs,  litigation  costs,  energy  costs,  and  so  on. 
I  want  trade  and  investment  to  remain  a  two-way  street.  The  U.S.  benefits  from 
a  large  amount  of  ‘‘insourcing’’—six  million  Americans  work  in  the  United  States 
for foreign companies and millions more jobs are created indirectly from this invest-
ment. 

I look forward to working with the Congress to enhance the environment for busi-

ness here at home.

Question 12a. The Administration and your predecessor, Secretary Evans, consist-
ently  cite  job  growth  as  a  sign  that  the  economy  is  moving  in  the  right  direction. 
Yet  we’re  losing  manufacturing  jobs  and  poverty  continues  to  rise.  We’re  starting 
to see the first signs of inflation. What will you do as Secretary to help put the na-
tion on sound financial footing? 

Answer.  From  my  vantage  point  at  Kellogg,  the  U.S.  economy  is  on  the  right 
track.  Clearly,  our  economy  has  overcome  several  blows  in  the  past  few  years.  But 
going forward, it appears to me, the essentials of a strong and growing economy are 
in place. 

Job  creation  and  economic  growth  are  signals  that  we  are  on  firm  footing.  The 
economy  grew  more  than  4  percent  in  2004  and  is  expected  to  grow  at  3.5  percent 
in 2005. We are experiencing a broad-based jobs recovery, with 2.6 million jobs cre-
ated  since  August  2003.  Inflation  is  relatively  low  and  energy  prices  are  nudging 
down. 

As Secretary, I will work with the Congress to exercise federal spending restraint, 
foster  a  tax  and  regulatory  climate  that  allows  businesses  to  grow  and  hire,  and 
serve as a steward of our resources.

Question  13.  As  you  know,  Senator  Stevens  and  I  have  annually  supported  in-
creased  funding  for  the  NOAA’s  tsunami  warning  program,  including  warning  cen-
ters  in  Hawaii  and  Alaska.  Despite  our  strong  support,  we  still  do  not  have  suffi-
cient  coverage  in  the  Pacific,  where  85  percent  of  all  tsunamis  occur.  I  understand 
that  NOAA  may  be  considering  developing  a  20-buoy  array  for  the  Indian  Ocean, 
where  we  today  have  no  buoys.  Could  you  please  provide  details  on  NOAA’s  plan 
for the Indian Ocean, and how the Administration plans to fund this endeavor? Will 
these  funds  be  part  of  a  future  emergency  supplemental  funding  package  or  part 
of your 2006 budget request? 

Answer. I have been advised that the Bush Administration is currently reviewing 
a proposal to implement a Global Tsunami Warning System that would include en-
hanced coverage in the Pacific Ocean and extension of coverage to the Indian Ocean. 
This  system  will  be  a  critical  component  of  the  Administration’s  plan  to  establish 
a  Global  Earth  Observing  System.  The  new  system  will  include  additional  tsunami 
buoys, tide monitoring stations, and efforts to improve community-based preparation 
for future events. The tsunami buoys would be placed along the major seismic fault 
lines to ensure accurate and timely warnings for tsunami events. 

I  am  further  advised  that  the  Administration  is  currently  completing  its  review 
of  the  proposal  for  the  Global  Tsunami  Warning  System,  but  at  this  time  has  not 
made any decisions on funding strategies.

Question  14.  With  respect  to  the  program  in  the  Pacific  Ocean,  how  will  you  en-
sure we improve accuracy of the Pacific warning system and will you provide fund-
ing for such increases in your FY 2006 and 2007 budget requests? 

Answer.  The  President’s  FY  2006  budget  will  be  released  in  early  February,  and 
I have not, of course, been involved in its development. As indicated in the previous 
question,  however,  the  Administration  is  currently  considering  a  proposal  to  imple-
ment  a  Global  Tsunami  Warning  System.  The  proposal  includes  specific  initiatives 
to  improve  observations,  warnings,  and  community  preparedness  in  each  of  the 
world’s  major  oceans,  including  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Given  the  frequency  of  tsunamis 
in the Pacific Ocean, the Pacific Region will be a high priority. 

The  Administration  is  currently  reviewing  the  proposal  for  the  Global  Tsunami 
Warning  System.  At  this  time,  the  Administration  has  not  made  any  decisions  on 
funding strategies for FY06 and FY07 budget requests. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV 

TO CARLOS M. GUTIERREZ 

Negotiating a Solution To The CDSOA Dispute 

Question. Since the Executive Branch’s strategy report in 2002, the United States 
has  lost  important  issues  raised  in  another  six  Rules  cases  at  the  WTO,  including 
the  statutory  challenge  to  the  Continued  Dumping  and  Subsidy  Offset  Act  of  2000 
or  ‘‘CDSOA’’—this  provision  is  also  known  as  the  ‘‘Byrd  amendment’’  as  it  was 
added by my senior colleague. 1 The Administration has recognized the CDSOA deci-
sion as imposing new obligations on the United States by prohibiting its distribution 
of  monies  sourced  from  assessed  antidumping  and  countervailing  duties.  Congress 
has  repeatedly  called  for  negotiations  to  address  the  issue  not  only  in  letters  but 
in  the  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2004  consolidated  appropriations  law  enacted  on  January 
23, 2004. 2 In response, the United States submitted a proposal in the Rules negotia-
tions  to  recognize  ‘‘the  right  of  Members  to  distribute  monies  collected  from  anti-
dumping and countervailing duties.’’ 3 The United States, however, has not yet sub-
mitted a formal textual proposal to address the issue. 

As  the  Secretary  of  Commerce,  can  you  commit  to  working  with  the  U.S.  Trade 
Representative  to  develop  a  formal  textual  proposal  in  the  context  of  the  Doha 
Round and to negotiate an early agreement which recognizes the sovereign right of 
WTO  Members  to  distribute  monies  collected  from  antidumping  and  countervailing 
duties?  This  provision  has  helped  the  very  companies  and  workers  who  have  been 
injured by illegal dumping and the U.S. Congress has every right to direct revenues 
in this common sense manner. 

Answer. I am advised that the Administration intends to continue to address this 
issue in the context of the WTO’s ongoing Doha Round of multilateral trade negotia-
tions.  I  understand  the  Administration  has  staunchly  defended  the  Continued 
Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 (CDSOA) throughout a long WTO dispute 
settlement  process  and  will  continue  to  work  with  our  trading  partners  to  achieve 
a  negotiated  resolution  of  the  underlying  issues.  While  I  understand  the  United 
States has not tabled a text on this issue, I understand a paper has been submitted 
indicating our intent to negotiate on this matter. 

As required in Senate Report language, the Department of Commerce and the Of-
fice  of  the  U.S.  Trade  Representative  are  consulting  to  ensure  proper  implementa-
tion  of  the  requirements  of  U.S.  law  regarding  negotiations  over  the  distribution  of 
antidumping  and  countervailing  duties.  I  am  advised  that  the  Administration  in-
tends to comply with all such requirements, including reporting requirements. I un-
derstand  that  the  Administration  will  complete  these  consultations  as  soon  as  pos-
sible  and  will  continue  to  work  to  advance  Congressional  objectives  in  the  Doha 
Round negotiations. 
Addressing Problems With The WTO Dispute Settlement System 

Question.  As  I  understand  it,  there  has  also  been  a  startling  lack  of  progress  in 
the Doha dispute settlement negotiations. This is despite the fact that the WTO dis-
pute  settlement  system  has  consistently  been  used  to  erode  the  effectiveness  of  our 
trade remedy laws. Two years ago, in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act 
of 2002, Congress expressed its concern with the pattern of WTO decisions imposing 
new obligations and restrictions on the use of antidumping, countervailing, and safe-

guard  measures. 4 In  the  Senate  Report,  Congress  recognized  that  foreign  govern-
ments  have  been  successfully  using  dispute  settlement  procedures  to  ‘‘erode  bar-
gained-for  trade  remedy  protections,’’  which  negatively  affects  American  firms, 
workers,  and  farmers  and  could  jeopardize  public  support  for  a  liberal  trading  sys-
tem. 5 Therefore,  one  of  principle  negotiating  objectives  with  respect  to  dispute  set-
tlement  is  the  negotiation  of  provisions  that  would  require  ‘‘determinations  based 
on facts and the principles of the agreements. . . .’’ 6 

Congress  further  required  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  to  submit  a  report  to  Con-
gress by December 31, 2002, identifying the Executive Branch’s strategy to address 
WTO  decisions  that  impermissibly  add  to  obligations  or  diminish  U.S.  rights  under 
the WTO Agreement. 7 In that report, the Executive Branch acknowledged the prob-
lem  with  the  dispute  settlement  system,  particularly  in  the  context  of  Rules  cases, 
and  pledged  to  address  the  problem  in  the  ongoing  Dispute  Settlement  and  Rules 
negotiations as well as in ongoing disputes. 

The  fact  is  that  the  United  States  has  been  on  the  receiving  end  of  more  GATT 
and  WTO  challenges  than  any  other  Member. 8 Over  the  past  two  years,  roughly 
half of all WTO decisions were issued in cases challenging U.S. measures, and over 
three-quarters  of  those  decisions  addressed  the  administration  of  our  trade  remedy 
laws.  Despite  our  frequent  posture  as  a  responding  party  in  WTO  dispute  settle-
ment  proceedings,  the  United  States  has  only  made  four  publicly-available  submis-
sions  in  the  dispute  settlement  negotiations  concerning  two  topics.  The  United 
States  has  yet  to  submit  a  textual  proposal  as  to  how  it  would  provide  ‘‘some  form 
of  additional  guidance  to  WTO  adjudicative  bodies  concerning  (i)  the  nature  and 
scope of the task presented to them (for example when the exercise of judicial econ-
omy is most useful) and (ii) rules of interpretation of the WTO agreements.’’ 9 While 
I  am  told  that  efforts  are  underway  to  submit  such  a  proposal,  I  find  it  alarming 
that  the  United  States  has  not  yet  approached  these  negotiations  with  the  same 
vigor and creativity as our trading partners. 

As  the  Secretary  of  Commerce,  how  do  you  intend  to  advance  the  negotiation  of 
changes to the WTO dispute settlement system or the Rules agreements that would 
reverse the long line of adverse (anti-U.S.) trade remedy decisions? 

Answer. Like my predecessor, Secretary Evans, I intend to work very closely with 
the  Office  of  the  U.S.  Trade  Representative  to  advance  the  negotiation  of  changes 
to  the  WTO  Dispute  Settlement  Understanding,  as  well  as  the  Antidumping  and 
Subsidies  Agreements,  that  will  not  only  reverse  the  most  egregious  decisions  of 
WTO dispute settlement panels and the Appellate Body, but will ensure that in fu-
ture  disputes,  the  panels  and  the  Appellate  Body  will  adhere  to  the  appropriate 
standards of review and give appropriate deference to the fact-finding and technical 
expertise of national investigating authorities. 

If  confirmed,  I  intend  to  follow  the  strategy  outlined  in  Secretary  Evans’  Decem-
ber 2002 report to Congress on this topic. First, it will entail working to gain great-
er  Member  country  control  over  the  dispute  settlement  process  and  greater  flexi-
bility  for  Member  countries  to  settle  disputes.  This  should  help  prevent  panels  and 
the  Appellate  Body  from  making  erroneous  and  unnecessary  findings  that  have 
often  added  or  reduced  the  rights  and  obligations  contained  in  the  Rules  Agree-
ments.  Second,  it  will  entail  working  to  make  the  dispute  settlement  system  more 
transparent. Greater public scrutiny of the system should make panels and the Ap-
pellate  Body  more  accountable  and  less  likely  to  impose  obligations  on  Member 
countries  not  found  in  the  WTO  agreements.  The  Administration  intends  to  pursue 
changes  to  the  Rules  Agreements  that  will  ensure  that  panels  and  the  Appellate 
Body  adhere  to  the  standards  of  review.  Finally,  I  understand  the  Administration 
will  continue  to  pursue  changes  to  those  Agreements  that  will  reverse  specific  ad-
verse  findings,  including  those  regarding  the  Continued  Dumping  and  Subsidy  Off-
set Act, ‘‘zeroing,’’ and injury determinations. 
TAA for Firms 

Question. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 established the Trade Adjustment As-
sistance program for firms to assist firms and industries negatively impacted by im-
port competition. The TAA for Firms program, which is administered by the Depart-
ment  of  Commerce  through  the  Economic  Development  Administration,  offers  tech-
nical  assistance  to  help  trade-impacted  firms  make  the  strategic  adjustments  nec-

essary  to  remain  competitive  in  a  global  economy.  Technical  assistance  is  provided 
through  one  of  12  regional  trade  adjustment  assistance  centers,  usually  involving 
private-sector contractors. 

In  a  December  2000  report  on  the  TAA  for  Firms  program,  the  Government  Ac-
countability  Office  (GAO)  made  two  disturbing  findings  regarding  the  Department 
of Commerce’s administration of the program:

• Less  than  half  (39  percent)  of  center  expenditures  (which  average  about  $10 
million  annually)  were  used  to  fund  technical  assistance  to  eligible  firms  with 
approved  business  recovery  plans.  Instead,  the  vast  majority  of  center  expendi-
tures (61 percent) went to fund operational and administrative costs.

• The impact of the TAA for Firms program is unclear because the Economic De-
velopment Administration has failed to formally monitor and track program re-
sults.

Mr.  Gutierrez,  to  your  knowledge,  has  the  Commerce  Department  taken  steps  to 
ensure that all 12 program centers are making the best use of the limited program 
funding? 

Since this report, has the Department developed a standard process for evaluating 

program outcomes? 

Answer.  Senator  Rockefeller,  I  have  been  advised  that  the  Department  of  Com-
merce  has  undertaken  substantial  efforts  to  ensure  that  the  Trade  Adjustment  As-
sistance  Centers  (‘‘TAACs’’)  (11  centers  as  of  2004)  are  being  run  more  efficiently 
and producing favorable results for its clients. 

I  have  been  informed  that  in  the  five  years  since  the  GAO  report,  the  Economic 
Development  Administration  (EDA)  has  implemented  several  substantive  improve-
ments.  As  reported  in  the  Department’s  GPRA  (Government  Performance  and  Re-
sults  Act)  measurements,  EDA  closely  tracks  the  number  of  adjustment  proposals 
implemented,  the  specific  firms  receiving  assistance,  as  well  as  documenting  the 
project descriptions of the assistance provided. 

In  addition,  I  have  been  advised  that  EDA  has  implemented  a  revised  allocation 
model for the TAA for Firms programs that rewards those TAACs that excel in pro-
ducing  results  (such  as  number  of  firms  assisted  and  number  of  jobs  impacted), 
while  acknowledging  the  different  geographic  and  demographic  factors  in  each 
TAAC service area. 
Defending  and  Preserving  Existing  Trade  Remedy  Laws,  Including  Our 

Ability to Capture the Full Amount of Dumping 

Question.  As  you  know,  the  WTO  Agreement  condemns  the  unfair  trade  practice 
of  injurious  dumping  and  provides  rules  for  how  WTO  Members  should  calculate 
dumping  margins.  The  Commerce  Department  has  the  responsibility  for  admin-
istering  U.S.  trade  remedy  laws  such  as  the  antidumping  and  countervailing  duty 
laws.  Despite  efforts  by  the  United  States  to  negotiate  clear  obligations  consistent 
with  U.S.  practice,  a  number  of  our  trading  partners  have  challenged  our  compli-
ance with the agreements negotiated. Unfortunately, the WTO panel and Appellate 
Body  dispute  review  system  has  resulted  in  a  series  of  decisions  that  are  contrary 
to the U.S. understanding of obligations assumed. 

Congress  has  mandated  that  as  part  of  the  ongoing  negotiations  problems  in  the 
dispute settlement process in our trade remedy cases be corrected and that our laws 
be maintained. One particularly troubling string of decisions out of the WTO Appel-
late Body is worth noting as if ever applied to U.S. law would fundamentally weak-
en  the  protection  promised  by  the  Congress  to  our  companies,  workers  and  their 
communities. The string of cases involves whether a government is allowed to offset 
100  percent  of  the  dumping  found.  Some  of  our  trading  partners  are  arguing  that 
they are entitled to ‘‘credit’’ for any exports which are not dumped. In the U.S., 100 
percent of the dumping found is captured and, if dumping continues, will be charged 
dumping duties. This common sense approach is what the U.S. has done for decades 
and  represents  the  desire  of  the  Congress  for  a  remedy  that  addresses  100  percent 
of  the  dumping  found.  Trading  partners  want  to  reduce  the  liability  by  receiving 
‘‘credit’’  for  non-dumped  transactions  even  though  this  was  never  contemplated  by 
the  U.S.  (or  other  countries)  during  the  negotiations  and  would  seriously  weaken 
the  remedial  purpose  of  U.S.  law.  The  claim  by  our  trading  partners  is  similar  to 
a  driver  telling  a  police  office  that  well,  yes,  they  were  going  70  miles  per  hour  in 
a 30 mile per hour zone but that infraction should be reduced or eliminated because 
they had been stopped at a traffic light shortly before! 

While the Secretary of Commerce has many functions in any Administration, the 
role of ensuring that our trade remedies are vigorously enforced and our rights fully 
protected is in my and many members of Congress’ view, paramount.

Can  you  assure  this  Committee  today  that  you  will  do  everything  within  your 
power  as  Commerce  Secretary  to  defend  and  preserve  our  existing  trade  remedy 
laws, including our ability to continue to capture 100 percent of the actual dumping 
(without any offset for non-dumped sales)? 

Answer. If confirmed, I will vigorously defend and enforce our existing trade rem-
edy laws, and implement those laws as intended to stop dumped or subsidized goods 
from injuring U.S. industries. 

With  respect  to  the  WTO  disputes  seeking  to  require  a  credit  for  non-dumped 
goods,  it  is  my  understanding  that  this  issue  has  not  been  finally  resolved.  The 
Commerce  Department,  working  closely  with  the  Office  of  the  United  States  Trade 
Representative,  is  vigorously  defending  its  ability  to  assess  duties  on  100  percent 
of the dumping, without offset from non-dumped goods, in several ongoing WTO dis-
putes. If confirmed as the Secretary of Commerce, I will instruct Commerce officials 
to  continue  to  defend  this  important  methodology  so  that  no  offset  is  required  for 
non-dumped sales. 
Technology Opportunity Program 

Question.  As  the  Secretary  of  Commerce,  you  will  oversee  the  National  Tele-
communications  and  Information  Administration  (NTIA).  As  a  keen  advocate  for 
broadband  technology  and  telecommunications,  I  believe  that  NTIA  should  play  an 
active role in policy and in community outreach. 

I  am  disturbed  that  this  Administration  has  sought  to  eliminate  funding  for  the 
popular  and  effective  Technology  Opportunity  Program  (TOPs),  and  that  funding 
was  eliminated  in  the  2005  Omnibus  Appropriations  bill.  In  2004,  TOPs  issued 
$14.4  million  in  27  grants  but  there  were  494  applications  seeking  $277  million. 
There were 6 grants from West Virginia in 2004, and one telemedicine grant to WV 
Primary  Care  Network  was  successful.  Other  TOPs  grants  are  helping  faith-based 
programs and supporting first responder networks. 

As Secretary of Commerce will you re-evaluate and reconsider the TOPs program. 
And if not, how do you propose to aggressively fulfill the mission of NTIA to promote 
telecommunications  access,  especially  in  rural  areas  which  has  less  access  to 
broadband, according to NTIA reports? 

Answer.  I  have  been  advised  that  the  Administration  viewed  the  TOP  program, 
established  in  1994,  as  one  that  has  fulfilled  its  mission  of  generating  awareness 
about  how  the  World  Wide  Web  can  enhance  delivery  of  social  services.  Increasing 
numbers  of  Americans  have  integrated  the  Internet  into  their  daily  lives  and  are 
using the Internet at a record pace. 

As  you  note,  Congress  eliminated  funding  for  the  TOP  program.  Nevertheless,  I 
understand  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  is  working  hard  to  bring  tele-
communications  and  broadband  services  to  rural  areas  through  a  variety  of  pro-
grams, including the rural broadband program created by the 2002 Farm bill. 

Should  I  be  confirmed,  I  would  work  to  ensure  that  wireless  broadband  services 
and  other  new  and  emerging  technologies  are  brought  to  the  marketplace  so  that 
broadband service is available to more Americans at affordable prices. 
TAA for Workers 

Question. I trust you are familiar with our Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA, 
program.  In  your  experience  with  Kellogg  or  as  a  board  member  of  Colgate-
Palmolive, you have likely seen examples of American workers benefiting from TAA 
when global free trade policies resulted in business decisions costing American jobs. 
In 2002, Congress passed the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act, which of-
fered  trade  displaced  workers  and  retirees  a  tax  credit  of  up  to  65  percent  of  the 
cost  of  health  insurance  coverage.  The  participation  rate  for  this  program  has  been 
very low (as of July 2004, less than 6 percent of the 229,044 who were eligible were 
enrolled).  Although  this  is  not  something  over  which  you  will  have  direct  oversight 
as  Secretary  of  Commerce,  would  you  be  willing  to  explain  how  you  might  advise 
the President and Congress on ways to improve the program, or do you believe there 
are  other  appropriate  ways—that  may  be  within  your  purview  as  Secretary—to 
ameliorate some of the negative impacts of trade policies on our domestic workforce? 
Answer.  From  my  roles  in  the  private  sector  I  have  seen  firsthand  the  powerful 

effect of trade in creating economic opportunity for workers across the globe. 

As I have learned, the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) for Workers is admin-
istered  by  the  Department  of  Labor.  I  am  aware,  however,  that  the  Department  of 
Commerce  administers  the  related  TAA  for  Firms  program.  I  have  been  advised 
that the Petition for Certification used by firms applying for TAA for Firms benefits 
includes a section highlighting the TAA for Workers program. 

In  my  discussions  with  senior  Department  officials,  I  have  further  learned  that 
the  Department  of  Commerce’s  Economic  Development  Administration  has

60

partnered closely with the Department of Labor’s Employment Training Administra-
tion  to  jointly  respond  to  communities  experiencing  sudden  or  severe  economic  dis-
location, such as caused by changing trade patterns. 

Should  I  be  confirmed  as  Secretary  of  Commerce,  I  will  work  to  strengthen  the 
ties  between  the  Commerce  Department  and  other  federal  entities  with  compatible 
missions  in  order  to  provide  the  most  effective  federal  response  possible  to  those 
communities facing economic challenges. 
Assessment  of  the  Commerce  Department’s  Application  of  Duty  Drawback 
Question.  I  understand  that  the  Department  of  Commerce  has  recently  changed 
their  practice  as  to  granting  duty  drawback  adjustments  to  U.S.  price  in  anti-
dumping  investigations  and  reviews.  Where  a  country  imposes  tariffs  on  imported 
products  used  as  inputs  in  domestically  sold  products,  and  which  are  not  collected 
on  exported  products,  the  statute  directs  the  Commerce  Department  to  adjust  for 
the  inclusion  of  these  duties  in  costs  and  prices  of  the  home  market  merchandise. 
However,  I  understand  that  Commerce  has  begun  granting  these  adjustments  in 
cases  in  which  the  subject  foreign  producers  use  no  imports  as  inputs  and  pay  no 
duties  for  products  sold  in  the  home  market.  This  contradicts  a  recent  Court  case, 
Hevensa  v.  U.S.,  has  resulted  in  low  or  no  margins  and  increased  dumped  imports 
from these countries and rewards countries for having high tariffs. This has resulted 
in layoffs and has caused economic injury to domestic industries. 

Can  you  please  consult  with  the  appropriate  Department  personnel  and  respond 

to me in writing regarding these actions at the Department? 

Answer. I am advised that there has been no change in the Department’s practice 
on  granting  adjustments  for  duty  drawback  and  that  the  Department’s  practice  is 
based on the language of the statute. I further understand that in the Hevensa case, 
the party at issue failed to satisfy the two-part test that the Department has tradi-
tionally  applied  and  that  the  U.S.  Court  of  International  Trade  has  consistently 
upheld. I am told that there has been no departure from that test or from relevant 
court precedent. One requirement of the two-part test is that there be sufficient im-
ports  of  raw  materials  to  account  for  the  duty  drawback.  I  understand  the  Depart-
ment  has  not  begun  granting  duty  drawback  adjustments  where  there  were  no  im-
ports  of  raw  materials.  Such  a  change  to  the  Department’s  practice  would  require 
a change in the law. The Department continues to grant adjustments only if the re-
spondent satisfies the court-sanctioned two-part test. 
Broadband Deployment in Rural America 

Question.  The  President  has  set  a  goal  of  universal  broadband  deployment  by 
2007.  I  wanted  to  ask  about  your  position  on  a  bill  that  Sen.  Burns  and  I  have 
worked  on  for  four  years  now  which  is  designed  to  help  meet  that  goal.  We  have 
proposed  a  tax  incentive  for  broadband  deployment.  It’s  targeted  primarily  at  rural 
areas  and  gives  special  emphasis  to  next-generation  broadband  like  fiber-to-the-
home. 

That bill has passed the Senate twice now. Last year in the FSC–ETI conference, 
the Senate conferees supported this provision 21–0. But the Ways and Means chair-
man  opposed  it  and  it  died  on  the  House  side.  What  I  can’t  understand  is  why  the 
Administration  did  not  weigh  in  support  of  the  broadband  tax  incentive.  It  is  com-
pletely  bi-partisan.  Senator  Burns  and  I  have  worked  hand  in  hand  on  this,  with 
60  other  members  of  the  Senate.  The  House  sponsor  is  a  Republican,  Mr.  English 
from  Pennsylvania.  We  could  have  passed  this  bill  with  your  support,  and  it  would 
have helped us meet the goal of universal deployment by 2007. 

So  my  question  is  this:  Can  I  have  your  pledge  to  look  at  this  legislation  anew 
and get back to me in the next month with a specific answer on whether the Admin-
istration  will  support  it?  I  think  if  you  look  at  it  with  a  fresh  eye,  you  will  agree 
that  it  is  good  policy  and  will  be  very  helpful  in  meeting  our  mutual  objective  of 
universal broadband deployment. 

Answer. As you note in your question, President Bush has articulated a bold new 
vision for broadband in America by setting a national goal for universal and afford-
able  access  to  broadband  by  2007.  I  think  that  this  is  a  very  important  goal,  both 
for  the  Nation  and  on  a  global  scale,  in  terms  of  our  nation’s  competitiveness,  and 
it is one that I wholeheartedly endorse and fully support. 

I  have  been  advised  that  although  the  recently  enacted  American  Jobs  Creation 
Act  of  2004  did  not  include  the  broadband  provision  that  you  and  Senator  Rocke-
feller  sponsored,  the  President  signed  the  Jobs  and  Growth  Tax  Reconciliation  Act 
of  2003,  which  included  provisions  that  allow  companies  to  accelerate  depreciation 
of  capital-intensive  broadband  equipment.  I  have  also  been  informed  that  the  Ad-
ministration  has  championed  making  the  research  and  experimentation  tax  credit 
permanent,  and  the  President  has  signed  into  law  an  18-month  extension  of  this

credit. The President has also supported dramatic increases in funding for research 
and development initiatives. 

I  believe  that  President  Bush  is  dedicated  to  keeping  our  nation  on  the  leading 
edge  of  progress  in  the  21st  century  by  encouraging  entrepreneurship  and  making 
the best technology available to our citizens. If confirmed, I hope to join him in help-
ing to achieve his goal of universal and affordable access to broadband for all Ameri-
cans. I will look forward to working with you and other members of the Committee 
and  the  Congress  on  achieving  the  President’s  goal,  and  I  would  be  willing  to  look 
at your bill and other relevant legislation introduced in the 109th Congress. I would 
also  consult  with  other  members  of  the  Administration  on  this  issue  which  crosses 
a number of departments. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO

CARLOS M. GUTIERREZ 

European Government Subsidies to Airbus 

Question  1.  I  am  pleased  the  Administration  decided  in  October  to  terminate  the 
1992  US–EU  Bilateral  Agreement  on  Aircraft  and  instead  rely  on  the  stricter  dis-
ciplines  of  the  World  Trade  Organization’s  Subsidies  Agreement.  The  1992  Agree-
ment  has  become  outdated  and  unhelpful  to  U.S.  interests.  It  is  well  past  time  to 
end  ‘‘launch  aid  for  the  development  and  production  of  large  commercial  aircraft.’’ 
Can I assume that you agree with the position that President Bush and the Admin-
istration have taken that European government subsidies to Airbus must cease? 

Answer.  I  do  support  the  President’s  position  on  ending  EU  subsidies  to  Airbus. 
These subsidies have caused unfair loss of U.S. exports, the laying off of highly paid, 
highly  skilled  workers  critical  to  the  U.S.  manufacturing  base,  and  loss  of  market 
share to key U.S. companies, and therefore must cease. 

I  understand  that  International  Trade  Administration  staff  has  been  working 
closely with the Office of the United States Trade Representative on its case against 
the  European  Commission.  I  will  see  to  it  that  the  Department  of  Commerce  con-
tinues to devote its resources and expertise to resolve this issue.

Question  2.  In  October,  the  U.S.  filed  a  ‘‘Request  for  Consultation’’  at  the  World 
Trade  Organization  regarding  European  government  subsidies  to  Airbus.  On  Janu-
ary 13, 2005, the U.S. will have the opportunity to request that the WTO’s Dispute 
Settlement  Body  include  this  issue  on  its  agenda  for  its  monthly  meeting  on  Janu-
ary  23rd.  Does  the  Administration  intend  to  file  a  formal  request  at  the  January 
23rd meeting to establish a panel to look into the Airbus subsidies and the resulting 
economic damages it has caused? Would you support such an action? 

Answer.  I  am  advised  that  the  U.S.  Trade  Representative  is  leading  Administra-
tion efforts on this issue with the Europeans. I understand that the Administration 
has  made  clear  that  it  is  time  to  bring  an  end  to  the  subsidies  to  Airbus.  While  I 
am  advised  that  the  Administration  is  prepared  to  achieve  that  objective  through 
litigation,  I  also  understand  that  the  Administration  continues  to  explore  ways  to 
achieve the same goal through negotiation. If I am confirmed, I can assure you that 
working  with  USTR  and  my  other  interagency  colleagues  to  bring  an  end  to  these 
subsidies will be a major priority.

Question  3.  Would  you  support  Administration  efforts  to  negotiate  a  new  agree-
ment  on  large  commercial  aircraft  with  the  European  Union,  with  the  underlying 
premise for negotiations that all ‘‘launch aid’’ must cease immediately? 

Answer.  It  is  important  to  level  the  playing  field  between  the  United  States  and 
European  aerospace  industries  whether  it  be  through  a  negotiated  agreement  or 
through  WTO  dispute  settlement  proceedings.  If  confirmed,  I  will  support  any  ef-
forts by the Administration toward that end. 

I  consider  this  a  very  important  issue  and,  if  confirmed,  I  would  look  forward  to 

continuing to work with you to resolve the matter. 
Pacific Northwest Salmon Recovery 

Question 1. Washington State, along with the entire Pacific Northwest, have been 
engaged  in  a  bipartisan,  on-the-ground  effort  to  recover  our  iconic  salmon  runs  to 
healthy,  harvestable  levels.  NOAA  Fisheries  plays  a  vital  role  in  these  recovery  ef-
forts. However, over the past year they have issued and proposed several extremely 
troubling  rule  changes  that  lead  many  of  us  to  question  the  agency’s  commitment 
to using sound science to recover our endangered salmon stocks. 

Specifically,  these  erosions  include  a  flawed  rewrite  of  the  government’s  plan  to 
recover salmon on the Columbia River that is unlikely to withstand judicial review; 
proposals  to  reduce  critical  habitat  designations  for  endangered  and  threatened 
salmon and steelhead in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California by up to 80 per-

62

cent;  a  hatchery  fish  listing  policy  that  would  count  salmon  grown  in  a  bucket  the 
same  as  those  reproducing  in  the  wild;  and  finally  amendments  to  the  Northwest 
Forest Plan which seriously dilute the ability of the Federal Government to protect 
salmon habitat on federal lands. 

I am very concerned that these proposals will move us away from the consensus- 
based  recovery  efforts  and  back  to  uncertainty  and  turmoil  and  to  the  era  of  court 
induced  ‘‘remedies.’’  I  do  not  want  to  see  that  happen.  Do  NOAA’s  proposals  rep-
resent  a  concerted  effort  to  erode  the  Pacific  Northwest’s  regional  efforts  to  recover 
endangered salmon runs?

Question  1a.  I  am  also  very  concerned  about  the  allegations  of  politics  trumping 
scientifically  based  decision-making.  If  confirmed  as  Secretary  of  Commerce,  what 
will you do to restore confidence in NOAA Fisheries?

Question 1b. To date our region has spent several billion dollars over the past 25 
years to protect the habitat and survivability of stream-bred wild salmon. Now that 
we  are  finally  beginning  to  see  results  of  these  efforts,  what  can  you  do  to  assure 
me that the Commerce Department will continue to request the resources necessary 
to support our collaborative, science-based recovery efforts?

Question  1c.  I  am  concerned  that  these  policy  shifts  will  not  be  legally  defensible 
and,  as  occurred  in  the  past,  a  federal  judge  may  overturn  NOAA’s  finding  and  my 
region  would  again  be  plunged  into  uncertainty  and  conflict  over  how  to  proceed 
with  salmon  recovery  efforts.  How  confident  are  you  that  these  policies  will  stand 
up to court challenges?

Answer.  First,  I  appreciate  you  raising  these  issues  with  me.  I  have  come  to  un-
derstand just how essential healthy salmon populations are to the Pacific Northwest 
region,  both  culturally  and  economically.  The  issues  you  raise  are  as  important  to 
me  as  Secretary-designate  as  they  are  to  you  as  a  representative  of  the  people  of 
Washington. I understand there is a good team of professionals at NOAA, and I as-
sure you I will work closely with them as the issues relating to salmon recovery are 
considered. I am committed to also working closely with all the stakeholders in the 
region,  as  well  as  their  elected  representatives  and  senators,  to  ensure  the  actions 
taken  by  NOAA  Fisheries  under  my  tenure  are  based  on  the  best  available  science 
and  every  appropriate  opportunity  for  peer  review  is  honored.  I  look  forward  to 
working  with  you  on  these  issues  and,  should  I  be  confirmed  as  Secretary  of  Com-
merce, I would welcome the chance to meet with you to discuss them in greater de-
tail. 
Recent Listing of Puget Sound Orcas Under the Endangered Species Act 

Question 1. Last month NOAA Fisheries proposed listing Puget Sound’s Southern 
Resident orcas population as ‘‘threatened’’ under the Endangered Species Act. Since 
the orcas range all over the Puget Sound and are the keystone species, I understand 
that  an  ESA  listing  could  potentially  have  a  dramatic  impact  on  my  home  state.  I 
do not want to see Puget Sound economic activity curtailed or the recovery of these 
majestic  whales  slowed  because  of  a  lack  of  agency  resources  to  process  the  likely 
increase in NOAA permit requirements. If confirmed as Secretary of Commerce, will 
your  provide  NOAA  Fisheries  with  the  additional  resources  they  will  need  to  fulfill 
these additional legal requirements?

Question 1a. As you know, an Endangered Species Act listing triggers the develop-
ment  of  a  conservation  plan.  Over  the  past  three  years  I  have  provided  resources 
to help inform and develop a plan for these orcas allow our region to move forward 
and  begin  identifying  the  steps  necessary  to  recover  these  regional  icons.  Will  you 
commit to a clear schedule so this plan can be finalized?

Question  1b.  Will  you  commit  to  working  to  see  that  NOAA  has  the  funding  to 

research what is causing these animals to decline?

Answer.  I  am  aware  of  the  Committee’s  strong  interest  in  the  southern  resident 
killer  whale  stock.  If  confirmed  as  Secretary,  I  will  consult  with  the  Committee  on 
all activities involving the recovery of southern resident killer whales. I am advised 
that  a  conservation  plan  is  under  development,  and  a  draft  should  be  available  in 
the early Spring of this year. I look forward to working with you with regard to this 
and other vital economic issues in the Pacific Northwest.
Magnuson-Stevens Reauthorization 

Question  1.  As  Secretary  of  Commerce,  you  would  have  primary  responsibility 
over the nation’s fisheries under the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Management Act. 
Recreational  and  commercial  fishing  is  vitally  important  contributor  to  Washing-
ton’s  economy,  generating  billions  of  dollars  in  economic  activity  and  thousands  of 
jobs. As you know, the Magnuson-Stevens Act will be brought up for reauthorization

63

in  the  upcoming  Congress.  Could  you  please  identify  the  reauthorization  priorities 
you would push as Secretary of Commerce?

Question 1a. How do you think we can best balance the economic needs of fisher-
man while maintaining the long-term sustainability of harvestable fish populations?
Question  1b.  I  was  pleased  that  the  U.S.  Ocean  Commissions  Report  found  that 
North  Pacific  seafood  resources  are  responsibly  managed  and  can  serve  as  a  model 
of  how  local  interests  can  collectively  address  overfishing  and  create  a  sustainable 
and  high  value  use  of  ocean  resources.  Do  you  agree  with  the  Commission’s  find-
ings?

Answer.  I  am  advised  that  the  Administration  plans  to  submit  a  revised  Magnu-
son-Stevens  Act  reauthorization  proposal  during  the  first  session  of  the  109th  Con-
gress  that  will  include  themes  similar  to  those  contained  in  the  Administration’s 
proposal that was transmitted to the 108th Congress. 

I am further advised by NOAA’s fisheries that there are several components nec-
essary  to  balance  the  economic  needs  of  fishermen  with  maintaining  harvestable 
fish  populations,  including:  (1)  providing  up-to-date  and  accurate  stock  assessment 
information  to  the  Regional  Fishery  Management  Councils;  (2)  expanding  scientific 
programs to address long-term environmental factors; (3) continuing to upgrade the 
application  of  Magnuson-Stevens  Act  management  requirements,  especially  the  na-
tional  standards  and  other  provisions  that  specifically  address  the  economics  and 
community needs of federally managed fisheries; and (4) working with the Councils 
to  encourage  the  development  of  management  measures  which  appropriately  use 
market-based economic incentives to promote resource sustainability as well as eco-
nomic viability. 

I  am  advised  that  the  North  Pacific  Fishery  Management  Council,  the  State  of 
Alaska,  and  all  the  user  groups  they  represent  have  done  an  excellent  job  in  man-
aging the resources in Alaskan waters. 
Counterfeiting of U.S. Goods in China 

Question  1.  The  counterfeiting  of  software,  movies,  music,  and  video  games 
abroad, particularly in China, costs the U.S. software and entertainment industries 
untold  billions  in  loses  annually.  Initiatives  to  crack  down  on  pirated  U.S.  intellec-
tual  property  and  counterfeit  goods  have  been  pursued  across  several  Administra-
tions  with  little  sustained  success.  What  priority  will  you  place  on  stemming  the 
flow  of  pirated  and  counterfeit  software,  games,  CDs,  and  DVDs  into  the  U.S.  from 
China and other countries? 

Answer.  I  know  that  this  Administration  recognizes  the  importance  of  protecting 
the intellectual property of U.S. businesses here and abroad and has made it a pri-
ority  to  fight  counterfeiting  and  piracy.  Intellectual  property  is  a  vital  component 
of our nation’s economy and our businesses and innovators deserve full government 
engagement  in  this  effort.  Having  spent  a  number  of  years  with  a  consumer  prod-
ucts company, I fully recognize the value of intellectual property assets and, if con-
firmed,  would  continue  to  follow  Secretary  Evans’  path  in  giving  intellectual  prop-
erty protection high priority status.

Question 2. Last October, the Commerce Department announced the Strategy Tar-
geting Organized Piracy initiative. What elements of the initiative focus specifically 
on stopping the piracy and counterfeiting of the U.S. goods in China? 

Answer.  The  Strategic  Targeting  Organized  Piracy  (STOP)  initiative,  to  my 
knowledge, is intended to address worldwide piracy and counterfeiting and does not 
specifically  target  any  particular  country.  All  countries  need  to  focus  domestically 
on the escalating problem of piracy and counterfeiting to eradicate the harm it does 
to  the  global  economy.  Because  of  the  scope  of  the  problem  in  China,  the  world’s 
largest  producer  of  and  market  for  counterfeit  goods,  attacking  this  issue  is  a  high 
priority  for  the  Department.  Under  STOP,  Commerce  will  work  on  the  problem  of 
piracy  and  counterfeiting  of  U.S.  goods  in  China  by  providing  technical  assistance 
and training to Chinese officials to help them bring their regime for protecting IPR 
into  compliance  with  their  obligations  under  the  WTO,  by  ensuring  that  U.S.  busi-
nesses understand the importance of taking steps to protect and enforce their intel-
lectual  assets,  and  by  helping  U.S.  rights  holders  navigate  the  Chinese  system.  We 
also  see  international  cooperation  with  our  likeminded  trading  partners,  such  as 
through  the  WTO,  WIPO,  and  APEC,  as  critical  to  improving  China’s  IPR  regime. 
Additionally, I have been advised that as part of STOP, a new Investigations and 
Compliance  unit  has  been  created  to  identify  and  pursue  the  elimination  of  foreign 
trade practices in violation of our trade agreements with respect to IPR. To combat 
the widespread piracy and counterfeiting in China, the unit established a case refer-
ral  program  with  its  Chinese  counterparts  to  address  specific  IPR  issues  of  U.S. 
companies in a timely and effective manner.

64

Question 3. What is the current status of the initiative’s implementation? 
Answer.  My  understanding  is  that  the  Department  of  Commerce  and  the  other 
agencies  involved  in  this  cooperative  effort  are  sharing  information  and  strategies, 
interacting  with  representatives  of  the  affected  industries,  and  continuing  to  map 
out the most effective and efficient means of stopping the flow of illicit merchandise. 
The Department of Commerce has set up a hotline and website to assist U.S. right 
holders  in  securing  intellectual  property  protection  abroad.  The  Department  also 
has produced and distributed a publication to small businesses detailing how STOP 
can protect their intellectual property at home and abroad.

Question 4. When should U.S. software companies and the entertainment industry 
expect to see a marked reduction in counterfeit products as a result of the initiative? 
Answer. While I would hope and expect to see positive results from the initiative 
on  an  expedited  basis,  I  am  not  in  a  position  at  this  point  to  provide  any  specific 
estimates. You have my assurance that, if confirmed, I will devote substantial effort 
to making this initiative work to the benefit of the affected industries.

Question 5. How does the Department plan on measuring the success of the initia-

tive? 

Answer. I am unaware that any specific method has been determined to measure 
the success of the initiative. If confirmed, I would work with the other agencies and 
representatives  of  the  affected  industries  to  develop  a  reasonable  method  to  do  so.
Question 6. What is the Administration doing to encourage and assist the Chinese 
Government  to  fix  the  apparent  shortcomings  in  its  judicial  system  with  respect  to 
the theft of intellectual property and the counterfeiting of goods? 

Answer. My understanding is that the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellec-
tual  Property  has  led  delegations  to  China  for  consultations  with  senior  officials  at 
China’s  patent,  trademark,  and  copyright  agencies  and  other  agencies  involved  in 
intellectual  property  issues  to  further  the  Administration’s  goals  of  improving  the 
intellectual  property  environment  for  U.S.  right  holders  in  China.  Those  consulta-
tions  have,  to  my  knowledge,  included  specific  discussions  on  improving  the  effec-
tiveness of the enforcement mechanisms available through the judicial and adminis-
trative systems. 

I  was  pleased  to  learn  that  for  the  first  time  an  attorney  from  USPTO’s  Office 
of  Enforcement,  who  is  fluent  in  Mandarin,  has  been  placed  as  a  full-time  attache´ 
at  our  embassy  in  China  to  help  make  sure  that  China  keeps  its  commitments  on 
intellectual  property  protection.  I  also  understand  that  the  USPTO  maintains  a 
team of China intellectual property rights experts here in Washington and has con-
ducted many training programs over the past several years for Chinese intellectual 
property  officials  on  the  importance  of  intellectual  property  protection  and  enforce-
ment.  In  recent  months,  Commerce  has  devoted  considerable  energies  to  improving 
the  criminal  IPR  enforcement  environment.  The  Department  has  also  worked  with 
the courts, police, judges and other officials in addressing relevant IPR concerns and 
business issues. 

If  confirmed,  I  would  certainly  encourage  further  consultations,  training  sessions 

and dialogue with Chinese officials. 
Diversion of User Fees From the Patent and Trademark Office 

Question  1.  The  general  sense  of  the  high-tech  community  is  that  the  United 
States  patent  approval  system  is  under-funded  and  over  burdened.  Last  year,  the 
creators of intellectual property—businesses, universities, and individuals, said that 
they  would  be  willing  to  pay  higher  fees  on  patent  applications,  as  well  as  change 
how  these  fees  are  structured,  if  the  Administration  and  Congress  would  promise 
not to divert these fees to fund unrelated government programs at the Department. 
Since 1992, approximately $700 million in PTO user fees have been diverted to un-
related  programs.  While  the  FY05  omnibus  appropriations  bill  includes  provisions 
that allowed the PTO to raise its fees over the next two years, and change the way 
the  fees  are  structured,  it  did  not  incorporate  language  that  would  once  and  for  all 
end patent-fee diversion. Is it your position that patent fees should be used only for 
their  intended  purpose  at  the  Patent  and  Trademark  Office  and  not  diverted  for 
other purposes within the Department? 

Answer. My understanding is that Secretary Evans and this Administration have 
worked  to  provide  USPTO  full  access  to  its  fees  and  that  the  recently  enacted  FY 
2005  budget  gives  the  USPTO  access  to  most  if  not  all  of  the  fees  it  expects  to  col-
lect.  The  USPTO  plays  a  critical  role  in  our  intellectual  property  system  and  econ-
omy.  If  confirmed,  I  would  work  with  my  colleagues  within  the  Administration  and 
the  Congress  to  help  ensure  that  the  USPTO  receives  full  access  to  its  fees  in  the 
future.

65

Question  2.  Can  you  assure  me  that,  if  confirmed,  you  will  do  everything  in  your 
power  to  ensure  that  user  fees  received  by  the  Patent  and  Trademark  Office  will 
not be diverted for other purposes within the Department in budgets you submit to 
Congress? 

Answer.  Consistent  with  my  answer  to  the  above  question,  if  confirmed,  I  would 
work with my colleagues within the Administration to help ensure that the USPTO 
receives  full  funding  in  the  future.  My  understanding  is  that  the  USPTO  submits 
its  proposed  budget  directly  to  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  for  consider-
ation.

Question  3.  What  additional  plans  do  you  have  to  ensure  high-quality  patent 
search  and  examinations,  to  reduce  the  time  it  takes  to  award  patents,  and  to  im-
prove the overall cost efficiency of the Patent and Trademark Office? 

Answer.  My  understanding  is  that  the  USPTO,  at  Congress’  direction,  developed 
a  21st  Century  Strategic  Plan  not  only  to  increase  productivity  in  processing  time 
but  also  to  enhance  quality  and  promote  electronic  filing  and  processing.  The  Plan 
has  the  backing  of  a  wide  range  of  businesses,  industries  and  trade  groups.  If  con-
firmed, I would work with the Director of the USPTO to ensure that the initiatives 
in the plan are fully funded and implemented in a timely manner.

Question 4. The increase in user fees will allow the Patent Office to hire a signifi-
cant number of new patent examiners. As the fee increase is for only two years, will 
you have to come back and ask Congress to make the fee increases permanent? 

Answer. My understanding is that implementation of the majority of the USPTO’s 
Strategic  Plan’s  initiatives,  including  the  hiring  and  training  of  patent  examiners, 
is  contingent  upon  adoption  of  changes  in  the  fee  system  that  are  contained  in  the 
United States Patent and Trademark Fee Modernization Act. Effective implementa-
tion  of  the  USPTO’s  strategic  plan  requires  that  the  USPTO  have  certainty  as  to 
future  revenues.  If  confirmed,  I  would  work  with  Congress  to  make  those  adjust-
ments permanent. 
Imports of Cement From Mexico Covered By U.S. Antidumping Orders 

Question.  One  of  our  most  longstanding  trade  issues  involves  imports  of  cement 
from Mexico, which are covered by a U.S. antidumping order. This case is a perfect 
example of why we need strong enforcement of laws against unfairly priced imports. 
Unlike  U.S.  cement  producers,  Mexican  producers  have  a  home  market  in  Mexico 
that  is  closed  to  any  outside  competition,  allowing  them  to  earn  high  profits  by 
charging among the highest cement prices in the world to Mexican customers. They 
use  their  high  profits  on  home  market  sales  in  Mexico  to  subsidize  their  exports  to 
the  United  States  at  unfairly  low  prices.  Without  an  antidumping  order  in  place, 
imports from Mexico would injure U.S. producers and impede investment in new ce-
ment capacity in the United States. Can you assure me that, under your leadership, 
the  Department  of  Commerce  will  be  aggressive  in  enforcing  U.S.  laws  against  un-
fairly traded imports, including those from Mexico? 

Answer.  I  have  been  informed  that  the  antidumping  duty  order  on  cement  from 
Mexico  has  been  in  place  for  many  years,  and  that  the  Commerce  Department  has 
conducted  numerous  annual  administrative  reviews  of  the  order.  These  reviews 
have  helped  ensure  that  the  amount  of  dumping  occurring  is  measured  in  a  timely 
manner,  and  that  the  appropriate  amount  of  duties  are  collected  so  that  these  im-
ports  do  not  continue  to  injure  domestic  producers.  If  I  am  confirmed  as  the  Sec-
retary of Commerce, I will ensure that the Department continues to work vigorously 
to  ensure  that  domestic  industries  are  not  injured  by  unfairly  traded  imports,  in-
cluding imports of cement from Mexico. 
Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership 

Question  1.  The  manufacturing  sector  is  important  to  my  state’s  economy.  Wash-
ington  State  has  lost  nearly  20  percent  of  its  manufacturing  workforce  since  Feb-
ruary  2001.  As  you  know,  last  March  the  Department  announced  the  President’s 
Manufacturing  Initiative  and  released  a  report  with  63  recommendations.  One  rec-
ommendation  called  for  ‘‘support  of  a  newly  coordinated  Manufacturing  Extension 
Partnership  (with  other  Department  programs)  and  creation  of  a  national  virtual 
network of centers of manufacturing excellence,’’ but was silent on funding program-
funding level. 

For  over  15  years,  the  MEP  program  nationally  has  provided  small  and  medium 
sized  manufacturers  with  the  help  they  need  to  make  them  more  globally  competi-
tive. In Washington, the Washington Manufacturing Services (WMS) provides exper-
tise  and  services  tailored  to  meeting  the  needs  of  our  smaller  manufacturers—from 
introducing  lean  manufacturing  to  suppliers  to  the  aerospace  industry  in  the  west-
ern  part  of  the  state  to  improving  the  efficiency  of  food  processors  in  the  eastern 
part  of  the  state.  In  2003,  Washington  Manufacturing  Services  completed  168

projects,  increasing  sales  of  its  clients  by  over  $17  million  and  reducing  their  costs 
by  over  $11  million.  This  is  a  program  that  works  for  Washington’s  smaller  manu-
facturers.  Can  you  assure  me  that,  if  confirmed,  you  will  do  everything  in  your 
power to ensure full funding for this important and successful program? 

Answer.  As  someone  who  has  spent  his  professional  career  with  a  U.S.  manufac-
turer,  I  can  assure  you  that  I  know  how  vital  the  role  manufacturers  large  and 
small  play  in  our  economy.  The  national  manufacturing  network  of  the  Hollings 
Manufacturing Extension Partnership is assisting our nation’s small manufacturers 
and  seeks  to  contribute  to  a  strong  economy.  I  will  work  with  the  members  of  the 
Commerce and Appropriations Committees to ensure that small manufacturers have 
access to the needed resources which allow them to remain competitive.

Question  2.  What  are  your  plans  to  coordinate  the  Hollings  MEP  program  with 

other Department programs? 

Answer. I have been informed that the Hollings MEP is working with other Com-
merce  agencies  as  well  as  with  other  Departments  that  may  be  interested  in  the 
program’s national manufacturing network. If I am confirmed as Secretary, I would 
support  greater  collaborations  with  other  Departments  which  can  use  MEP  to  ben-
efit their mission.

Question  3.  What  are  you  plans  to  create  a  national  virtual  network  of  centers 

of manufacturing excellence? 

Answer. Since I have not yet been confirmed, I am not yet part of the budget proc-
ess,  so  I  cannot  speak  to  any  plans  for  a  ‘‘virtual  network  of  centers.’’  I  am  aware 
of  the  importance  of  manufacturing  to  the  economy.  If  confirmed  as  Secretary  of 
Commerce, I will support our nation’s manufacturers in their efforts to become more 
competitive  and  productive  in  the  global  marketplace  by  ensuring  that  they  have 
access to technical and information resources. 
Digital Divide 

Question 1. This past fall, the NTIA in collaboration with ESA, released ‘‘A Nation 
Online:  Entering  the  Broadband  Age.’’  The  report  describes  the  results  of  NTIA’s 
most  recent  in  a  series  of  biennial  surveys  on  our  Nation’s  access  and  use  of  the 
Internet  and  broadband.  The  report  acknowledged  that  there  remains  a  digital  di-
vide  between  urban  and  rural  populations  with  respect  to  broadband  connections, 
but  was  silent  on  whether  there  remains  a  digital  divide  with  respect  to  race  and 
ethnicity. Buried in Appendix Table I there are statistics that would indicate a dig-
ital divide remains with respect to race and ethnicity. While 65 percent of non-His-
panic  whites  use  the  Internet  from  any  location,  only  45  percent  of  blacks  and  37 
percent  of  Hispanics  do.  Additionally,  there  is  roughly  twice  as  many  non-Hispanic 
whites  living  in  households  with  broadband  (25.7  percent)  as  there  are  black  and 
Hispanic  households  (13.9  percent  and  12.6  percent  respectively).  Given  these  sur-
vey results, I have serious doubts whether President Bush’s goal that all Americans 
should  have  universal,  affordable  access  to  broadband  technology  by  2007  will  be 
met. Over the years, the Department has funded these biennial surveys through the 
Technology Opportunities Program (TOP). 

As  you  know,  TOP  promotes  the  use  of  advanced  telecommunications  and  infor-
mation technologies to improve the provision of education, health care, or public in-
formation  in  the  non-profit  and  public  sectors.  Unfortunately,  the  Administration 
did  not  request  nor  did  the  Congress  provide  any  new  appropriations  for  TOP  in 
2005. Funding from TOP also funded the biennial survey and reports. With the TOP 
ending  in  FY  2004,  it  is  not  clear  that  the  Department  intends  to  fund  future  sur-
veys  and  reports.  Do  you  believe  there  remains  a  digital  divide  for  access  to  dial-
up and broadband Internet with respect to race and ethnicity? With respect to rural 
and urban populations? 

Answer.  It  is  my  understanding  that  Internet  usage  and  broadband  usage  have 
grown dramatically since President Bush took office. I have been advised that in the 
four  years  since  the  President  took  office,  broadband  subscribership  has  grown  by 
over  300  percent,  with  the  number  of  high  speed  lines  growing  from  9.6  million  to 
32  million,  and  today  more  Americans  access  the  Internet  through  broadband  than 
dial-up connections. The President has also worked to harness the forces of market 
competition  to  lower  the  costs  of  Internet  access.  For  example,  the  price  of  com-
puters  themselves  have  fallen  substantially  to  bring  the  Internet  within  the  finan-
cial  reach  of  most  households.  I  have  also  been  informed  that  while  there  may  be 
some  differences  in  use  of  the  Internet  across  some  demographic  and  geographic 
groups,  this  gap  is  closing  rapidly  and  there  has  been  tremendous  growth  in  Inter-
net and broadband usage across all racial, ethnic, and geographic groups.

Question 2. What do you see as the federal role in reducing these so called digital 

divides? 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  09:43 Nov 14, 2005 Jkt 022734 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22734.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

Answer.  I  share  the  President’s  vision  of  the  role  of  government  in  addressing 
these  issues.  The  President  has  stated  that  ‘‘[t]he  role  of  the  government  is  not  to 
create  wealth;  the  role  of  the  government  is  to  create  an  environment  in  which  the 
entrepreneur  can  flourish,  in  which  minds  can  expand,  in  which  technologies  can 
reach  new  frontiers.’’  If  confirmed,  I  would  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Presi-
dent to sustain an environment in which we can continue strong growth in Internet 
and broadband usage across all demographic and geographic groups. 

As  you  note  in  your  question,  President  Bush  has  articulated  a  bold  new  vision 
for broadband in America by setting a national goal for universal and affordable ac-
cess  to  broadband  by  2007.  I  think  that  this  is  a  very  important  goal,  both  for  the 
Nation and on a global scale, in terms of our nation’s competitiveness, and it is one 
that I wholeheartedly endorse and fully support.

Question 3. What will be the Department’s role in achieving the President’s stated 
goal that all Americans should have universal, affordable access to broadband tech-
nology by 2007? 

Answer. If confirmed, I would look forward to working with President Bush to en-
sure  that  we  create  and  sustain  an  economic  and  regulatory  environment  in  which 
broadband  can  continue  to  grow.  I  would  work  with  the  President  to  ensure  that 
proper fiscal policies, such as the moratorium on Internet taxes, which I have been 
informed  that  the  President  signed  into  law,  are  in  place  to  promote  broadband.  I 
have been advised that the Department of Commerce plays an important role in the 
management  of  spectrum  and  development  of  spectrum  policy.  Should  I  be  con-
firmed,  I  would  continue  the  Administration’s  efforts  to  ensure  that  adequate  radio 
spectrum is available for wireless broadband services and work to ensure that overly 
burdensome  regulations  do  not  impede  the  development  of  new  broadband  tech-
nologies, in order to make broadband service available to more Americans at afford-
able prices.

Question  4.  Can  you  assure  me  that,  if  confirmed,  you  will  do  everything  in  your 
power to continue funding the biennial surveys and reports on our Nation’s Internet 
and broadband usage. 

Answer.  I  have  been  informed  that  the  Department  of  Commerce  has  produced 
reports  on  Internet  and  broadband  usage.  If  confirmed,  I  will  be  pleased  to  review 
the budget and get back to you on this matter. I have been advised that the prepa-
ration of the President’s Fiscal Year 2006 budget request is nearing completion and 
as I stated in the hearing I am not willing to commit to promises that I cannot keep 
as  I  have  not  been  involved  in  the  Fiscal  Year  2006  budget  to  date.  Should  I  be 
confirmed,  I  will  be  actively  involved  in  the  Department’s  budget  and  determining 
how the Department can best carry out its mission. 
Unimpeded Market Access for U.S. Software Products in China 

Question.  As  you  know,  China  has  a  huge  trade  surplus  with  the  United  States. 
China’s  Premier  has  stated  that  China  will  reduce  this  surplus  by  importing  more 
American  products.  Yet  it  appears  that  the  Chinese  government  is  about  to  throw 
up a new barrier to market access for one of our most competitive exports by requir-
ing  government  ministries  to  purchase  only  Chinese  software.  I  understand  that 
China is on the verge of releasing government procurement regulations that will bar 
most U.S. software products from the government market. What is the Administra-
tion’s position on this issue, and what is its strategy for addressing it? 

Answer. I understand that the Administration has been monitoring China’s devel-
opment  of  its  software  government  procurement  policy  since  the  issue  emerged  in 
early  2003,  and  has  been  actively  engaging  Chinese  leadership  to  encourage  China 
to  allow  U.S.  companies  to  continue  to  provide  software  products  and  services.  Sec-
retary Evans intends to raise this issue with senior Chinese leaders when he travels 
to China during the week of January 10. This is a priority issue for the Administra-
tion  and,  if  confirmed,  I  will  continue  to  press  the  Chinese  on  this  issue  at  senior 
levels. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO

CARLOS M. GUTIERREZ 

Question 1. In your view, have the policies of the Bush administration contributed 
to  our  huge  trade  deficit?  Do  you  view  the  trade  deficit  as  a  problem  that  govern-
ment has any role in correcting? 

Answer.  No,  I  do  not  believe  the  policies  of  the  Bush  Administration  contributed 
to  our  huge  trade  deficit.  The  trade  deficit  is  a  symptom  of  several  developments 
in the world economy. For example, the trade deficit certainly reflects large dispari-
ties in the growth rates of the economies of the United States and its major trading

partners.  The  strong  U.S.  economy  has  attracted  imports,  while  slow  growth  in 
Japan and Europe has impeded growth in U.S. exports. Encouraging growth abroad 
and breaking down foreign barriers to U.S. exports, by negotiating new trade agree-
ments and enforcing existing agreements, are important actions for the Government 
to  continue  to  pursue.  In  addition,  if  Americans  increase  national  savings,  that 
would reduce our reliance on foreign sources of capital to fund U.S. investment. The 
Administration’s recommended policies to increase national saving—by reducing the 
budget deficit and expanding tax-deferred savings accounts—can play an important 
role in reducing the trade deficit.

Question 2. During President Bush’s first term, no net jobs were created. Why did 
the tax cuts fail to spur payroll employment? Doesn’t the policy need to be changed? 
Answer.  As  I  experienced  firsthand  at  the  Kellogg  Company,  the  U.S.  economy 
was  affected  by  an  unusual  series  of  powerful  shocks  over  the  past  four  years—in-
cluding the collapse of the high-tech stock bubble, the terrorist attacks of 9/11, cor-
porate accounting scandals, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Those were con-
siderable headwinds for the U.S. economy. Fortunately, the Administration’s tax re-
lief—along  with  aggressive  action  by  the  Federal  Reserve—helped  to  moderate  the 
impact of these shocks. As a result, the recent recession was the mildest on record—
and  U.S.  economic  growth  has  been  faster  than  any  other  G–7  country  since  the 
fourth quarter of 2000. Total employment as of the most recent reports in fact shows 
a  net  gain  in  employment  since  January  2001.  In  addition,  I  understand  that  ac-
cording  to  the  payroll  survey,  the  U.S.  economy  has  created  2.6  million  new  jobs 
over the past 16 months and the unemployment rate is 5.4 percent.

Question  3.  Many  observers  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  acknowledge  that  the  role 
of cabinet secretaries in this Administration, particularly when it comes to economic 
policy,  has  been  to  cheerlead  rather  than  to  make  policy.  As  a  relative  outsider  to 
a very insular group of people, how will you make your voice heard? 

Answer.  I  plan  to  be  actively  involved  in  policy  and  decisionmaking  that  affects 
the Department of Commerce and the business community. I believe that my experi-
ences  running  a  business,  hiring  people,  and  selling  products  in  the  United  States 
and  overseas,  will  make  mine  a  valuable  voice  advising  the  President.  I  will  work 
closely with my colleagues in the Cabinet and Members of Congress to continue poli-
cies that foster the conditions for businesses and the economy to grow.

Question 4. What business dealings did Kellogg’s have with Cuba while you were 

CEO? 

Answer.  Kellogg  Company  did  not  do  business  with  Cuba  while  I  was  the  Chief 
Executive  Officer.  In  2002,  our  Caribbean  division  considered  participating  in  a 
Cuba  Trade  Show,  but  decided  not  to  and  no  Kellogg  Company  employees  partici-
pated.

Question 4a. Do you believe sanctions against Cuba should be lifted? 
Answer. No, I fully support the policy of this Administration as established under 
the  Cuban  Democracy  Act  and  other  laws.  The  Administration  has  indicated  that 
it  is  prepared  to  reduce  sanctions  against  the  Cuban  government  once  Cuba  has  a 
transition government that is committed to the establishment of a fully democratic, 
pluralistic  society.  I  understand  the  Administration  has  stated  that  the  embargo  is 
the best leverage to promote such change, and I agree.

Question  5.  In  September  of  2004,  Kellogg’s  was  cited  in  one  of  the  five  worst 
cases  of  corporate  lawsuit  abuse  by  the  Foundation  for  Taxpayer  and  Consumer 
Rights.  According  to  the  Foundation,  Kellogg’s  engaged  in  a  multi-year  harassment 
campaign  against  a  small  business,  Toucan  Golf,  just  because  the  Toucan  bird  was 
also used to sell Kellogg’s Froot Loops. As Secretary of Commerce, you will have ju-
risdiction over the Patent and Trademark Office, which has a large role in resolving 
such disputes. How can we be assured you’ll treat small companies fairly in disputes 
with giant corporations? 

Answer.  As  you  know,  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  has  responsibility  for  many 
agencies, from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to the Mi-
nority Business Development Agency. If confirmed, I assure you that I will take all 
of  these  responsibilities  seriously  and  make  decisions  in  a  fair  and  impartial  man-
ner, regardless of the size or type of business involved in any particular matter. 

The litigation mentioned above is not an action involving the Department if Com-
merce;  it  is  an  action  between  two  private  parties  who  have  taken  their  dispute  to 
the U.S. court system. The Department does not play a role in such matters. To the 
extent  that  the  Department,  through  the  USPTO,  does  hear  disputes  between  pri-
vate  parties  or  ex  parte  appeals,  its  proceedings  are  fully  transparent  and  subject 
to the rule of law, case precedents, and court review.

Question 6. As you know, the Commerce Department has jurisdiction over the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I have introduced legislation to pro-
tect deep water corals. ‘‘Deep water corals’’ make up two-thirds of the ocean’s corals 
and provide vital fishery habitats, but they are being destroyed by bottom trawling. 
The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy has made several recommendations regarding 
the  protection  of  deep  water  corals.  If  confirmed,  would  you  work  to  get  these  rec-
ommendations implemented? 

Answer.  As  one  part  of  the  Administration’s  response  to  the  U.S.  Commission  on 
Ocean  Policy’s  report,  the  U.S.  Ocean  Action  Plan,  the  President  tasked  the  newly 
formed  Committee  on  Ocean  Policy  with  determining  which  agency  or  agencies 
should take the lead in coordinating the Federal Government’s research and science 
activities  related  to  deep-sea  corals.  I  understand  that  the  role  of  deep-sea  corals 
in  marine  ecosystems,  is  an  important  emerging  issue.  I  will,  if  confirmed,  ensure 
that  the  Department,  including  NOAA,  works  with  you  and  your  staff  and  other 
Members  of  Congress  on  this  important  natural  resource  issue.  I  expect  the  Com-
mittee on Ocean Policy and its subordinate bodies will be taking a very careful look 
at this issue. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK PRYOR TO

CARLOS M. GUTIERREZ 

Foreign Trade Barriers on Scrap Exports 

Question.  Concerns  about  foreign  trade  barriers  on  the  export  of  steel  scrap  have 
been brought to my attention. Specifically, I have been advised that the barriers on 
the  export  of  steel  scrap  may  be  harming  our  manufacturing  economy,  including 
U.S.  steel  consumers,  U.S.  steel  producers,  and  the  manufacturing  jobs  associated 
with  these  companies.  Scrap  prices  have  tripled  in  the  last  two  years,  and  while 
U.S.  steel  scrap  exports  continue  to  increase,  our  trading  partners  like  Russia,  the 
Ukraine, and Korea continue to restrict or even prohibit their own scrap exports to 
the detriment of U.S. steel consumers and producers. Today, nearly half of all scrap 
exported  by  the  United  States  goes  to  countries  that  themselves  maintain  export 
taxes or other barriers on steel scrap. I am concerned that the reported barriers on 
steel  scrap  trade  may  constitute  unfair  subsidies  that  are  harming  our  manufac-
turing  economy.  If  confirmed  as  Secretary  of  the  Department  of  Commerce,  what 
will  you  do  to  address  this  crisis  and  to  level  this  fundamental  imbalance  in  the 
global steel scrap market? 

Answer.  I  share  your  concerns  that  foreign  government  restrictions  on  scrap  ex-
ports  are  a  problem  for  steel  producers  and  consumers  and  their  employees  in  the 
United States. I am especially concerned about the export duties imposed by Russia 
and Ukraine. 

I  understand  that  Secretary  Evans  worked  actively  with  Ambassador  Zoellick  to 
encourage  these  countries  to  remove  these  duties  as  soon  as  possible.  In  the  World 
Trade Organization (WTO) accession negotiations with both countries, the Adminis-
tration is seeking the elimination of the duties on steel scrap. I understand that the 
Commerce Department believes that the Administration’s advocacy has helped keep 
Russia from raising further barriers to scrap exports requested by consumers there. 
I have been advised that the Korean government, which began monitoring scrap ex-
ports early in 2004, stopped doing so on September 30, 2004. 

I  understand  the  Administration  continues  to  monitor  the  scrap  and  steel  price 
situation carefully, and raises the issue of foreign government export restrictions on 
steel  raw  materials  in  multiple  international  fora.  Moreover,  I  have  been  advised 
that  Commerce,  working  with  USTR  and  the  governments  of  Canada  and  Mexico, 
developed  a  joint  NAFTA  governments’  statement  for  the  January  12–13,  2005 
OECD  Global  Steel  Conference,  urging  governments  of  steel-producing  countries  to 
work with us to eliminate steel raw material export duties and restrictions. 

If  confirmed  as  Secretary  of  Commerce,  I  will  continue  Commerce’s  close  collabo-
ration  with  USTR  to  seek  the  removal  of  foreign  government  restrictions  that  con-
tribute to increased prices for steel raw materials for U.S. manufacturers. 
Assessment  of  the  Commerce  Department’s  Application  of  Duty  Drawback 
Question.  I  understand  that  the  Department  of  Commerce  has  recently  changed 
their  practice  as  to  granting  duty  drawback  adjustments  to  U.S.  price  in  anti-
dumping  investigations  and  reviews.  Where  a  country  imposes  tariffs  on  imported 
products  used  as  inputs  in  domestically  sold  products,  and  which  are  not  collected 
on  exported  products,  the  statute  directs  the  Commerce  Department  to  adjust  for 
the  inclusion  of  these  duties  in  costs  and  prices  of  the  home  market  merchandise. 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  09:43 Nov 14, 2005 Jkt 022734 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\22734.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

70

However,  I  understand  that  Commerce  has  begun  granting  these  adjustments  in 
cases  in  which  the  subject  foreign  producers  use  no  imports  as  inputs  and  pay  no 
duties  for  products  sold  in  the  home  market.  Concerns  have  been  raised  that  this 
contradicts a recent Court case, Hevensa v. U.S.; has resulted in low or no margins 
and increased dumped imports from these countries; and rewards countries for hav-
ing high tariffs. As a result, the domestic industry has suffered economic injury and 
layoffs have occurred. 

Can  you  consult  with  the  appropriate  Department  personnel  and  respond  to  me 

in writing regarding these actions at the Department? 

Answer.  I  have  been  advised  that  there  has  been  no  change  in  the  Department’s 
practice  on  granting  adjustments  for  duty  drawback  and  that  the  Department’s 
practice  is  based  on  the  language  of  the  statute.  I  further  understand  that  in  the 
Hevensa case, the party at issue failed to satisfy the two-part test that the Depart-
ment  has  traditionally  applied  and  that  the  U.S.  Court  of  International  Trade  has 
consistently  upheld.  I  have  been  told  that  there  has  been  no  departure  from  that 
test  or  from  relevant  court  precedent.  One  requirement  of  the  two-part  test  is  that 
there be sufficient imports of raw materials to account for the duty drawback. I un-
derstand the Department has not begun granting duty drawback adjustments where 
there were no imports of raw materials. Such a change to the Department’s practice 
would require a change in the law. The Department continues to grant adjustments 
only if the respondent satisfies the court-sanctioned two-part test.
