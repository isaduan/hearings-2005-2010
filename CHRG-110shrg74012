ASSESSING  THE  RECOMMENDATIONS  OF  THE 

FEDERAL-STATE  JOINT  BOARD 

TUESDAY,  JUNE  12,  2007 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:05  a.m.  in  room

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator  STEVENS.  Good  morning.  The  Chairman  will  be  along, 
we  hope,  in  a  little  while.  For  those  of  you  who  are  interns,  you 
can come up and use some of these chairs up here. 

Today,  the  Committee  revisits—this  is  the  Chairman’s  state-
ment—today,  the  Committee  revisits  a  familiar  topic,  Universal 
Service. More than a decade ago, in the Telecommunications Act of 
1996,  as  a  Congress,  we  made  clear  that  we  are  committed  to  the 
principle of Universal Service. We stated that, in all regions of the 
Nation—rural,  urban,  and  everywhere  in  between—consumers  are 
entitled  to  comparable  services  at  comparable  rates.  The  Federal 
Communications  Commission  was  charged  with  translating  this 
lofty  principle  into  concrete  action.  To  do  so,  they  set  up  the  Uni-
versal Service Fund. 

Today,  that  Fund  faces  some  difficult  challenges.  If  the  Fund 
continues  to  expand  at  current  pace,  some  say  we  may  jeopardize 
Universal Service itself. Incumbent carriers urge us to place limits 
on the ability of other carriers to access these funds. ‘‘How is it fea-
sible,’’  they  ask,  ‘‘for  the  Universal  Service  Fund  to  support  so 
many  different  carriers  serving  so  few  customers  in  rural  areas?’’ 
Still other carriers, many of them, wireless providers, ask if it’s fair 
to  reduce  support  that  may  be  necessary  to  serve  large  swaths  of 
rural  America.  ‘‘In  order  to  provide  comparable  services  at  com-
parable rates,’’ they say, ‘‘we need to access these funds.’’ 

Last  month,  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service 
weighed  in  on  this  matter.  It  recommended  the  Commission  cap 
the  amount  of  funds  available  to  competitive  providers  as  an  in-
terim  measure,  pending  broader  Universal  Service  reform.  In  the 
end,  we  cannot  let  short-term  proposals  free  us  from  the  need  to 
address long-term reform. If comprehensive reform requires a more 
vigorous review of the identical support rule or any other aspect of

existing policy, we should proceed down that road. After all, ensur-
ing  the  long-term  sufficiency  and  stability  of  Universal  Service 
funds  means  ensuring  all  of  our  citizens  have  communications  ca-
pabilities they need to compete in the global economy. 

I’ll  place  my  statement  in  the  record,  following  the  remarks  of 

the Chairman. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Stevens follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

I  thank  the  Chairman  for  scheduling  this  hearing.  Senator  Inouye  is  my  great 
friend  who  has  become  a  leader  with  respect  to  Universal  Service  ever  since  we 
worked  together  to  assure  Alaska  and  Hawaii  had  the  same  phone  rates  as  in  the 
rest of our country. 

This  Committee  has  heard  much  about  problems  with  Universal  Service  which 

need to be addressed: 

• contributions only come from long distance service. 
• broadband is not explicitly supported. 
• and critics continue to raise accountability concerns. 
For  me  the  importance  of  a  unified  and  national  communications  infrastructure 
remains  paramount  and  Universal  Service  is  needed  to  ensure  the  availability  of 
communications  services  throughout  the  country.  I  hope  this  hearing  today  will 
move  the  Committee  forward  to  engage  Universal  Service  reform  in  a  comprehen-
sive fashion. 

The  Committee  will  hear  today  about  the  proposed  cap  on  wireless  Universal 
Service support. My hope is the panel will explain if and how an interim cap would 
advance the fundamental reform Universal Service needs. 

To put off such reform the more risk there is that there will be a communications 
divide  in  this  country,  a  shameful  outcome  which  would  hurt  jobs  and  small  busi-
nesses throughout rural America, including my home state Alaska. 

Thank you. 

Senator STEVENS. Senator, do you have an opening statement? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 
Senator DORGAN. Just very briefly, Senator Stevens. 
I’m  not  going  to  be  able  to  stay  for  the  entire  hearing,  because 
of  other  committees,  but  I  do  want  to  say—it’s  been  obvious,  for 
some  long  while,  I  think,  to  many  of  us  on  this  Committee,  that 
the  Universal  Service  Fund  issue  needs  attention,  and  needs  seri-
ous attention. 

I  think  those  of  us  that  come  from  rural  states  understand  the 
urgency  of  fixing  this  problem.  The  ‘‘comparable  services  at  com-
parable  prices,’’  represents  the  language  that  we  included  in  1996. 
Those  of  us  who  were  on  the  Committee  then  were  deliberate,  in 
terms  of  what  we  wanted  to  do  and  what  we  intended  to  accom-
plish. We included, by the way, ‘‘advanced services.’’ At that point, 
we didn’t know much about broadband, but we included ‘‘advanced 
services’’ in that requirement. 

I  acknowledge  that  the  Joint  Board  has  done  its  work.  It’s  now 
very important that we proceeds, and see that the FCC proceed, in 
untangling these problems, resolving them, and having a Universal 
Service Fund that does what it’s intended to do so that we are not 
left, a year or 2 or 5 years from now wondering how on Earth this 
gets fixed.

Senator  Stevens,  you  and  I,  and  others  on  this  Committee,  have 
introduced  legislation  on  these  issues.  And  my  hope  is  that  at 
last—at long, long last—we will be able to see these resolved. 

Senator STEVENS. Thank you very much. 
Senator Sununu? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 

Senator SUNUNU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I simply want to offer a few comments about the recent decision 

by the Joint Board. 

As  Senator  Dorgan  indicated,  this  is  an  issue  we’ve  been  going 
around  for  some  time.  We  tried  to  deal  with  it  in  the  comprehen-
sive telecommunications bill we marked up last year. And, unfortu-
nately, that didn’t move forward. We had a proposal in Committee 
for  an  overall  cap  on  the  Fund,  which  I  think  is  extremely  impor-
tant, because there is so much going on within the Fund for which 
it  was  not  intended.  It  provides  subsidies  to  companies  instead  of 
consumers.  It  provides  subsidies  to  consumers  in  areas  that  aren’t 
necessarily  deserving  of  subsidies,  because  they’re  not  areas  that 
are  underserved,  they’re  not  at  an  economic  disadvantage,  or 
they’re  not  true  rural  high-cost  areas.  That  should  be  the  focus  of 
the Fund. 

What  the  Joint  Board  has  done  is  recommend  a  relatively  arbi-
trary  cap  for  one  segment  of  Universal  Service,  the  CETCs.  I  had, 
with other members of this Committee, written a letter specifically 
suggesting  they  not  take  this  approach,  that  they  look  at  a  more 
comprehensive approach for capping funds. 

And,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  ask  that  that  letter  be  made  part 

of the record. 

Senator STEVENS. Without objection.

UNITED STATES SENATE 

Washington, DC, April 13, 2007 

Hon. DEBORAH TATE, 
Chairman, 
Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, 
Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Joint Board Chairman Tate, 

The  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service  (Board)  was  established,  in 
part, to provide recommendations on how best to preserve and advance the Federal 
Universal  Service  (USF)  program.  We  arc  writing  today  to  provide  the  Board  with 
our  views  on  the  USF  program,  which  we  believe  must  be  substantially  reformed 
to  if  it  is  to  continue,  and  to  share  our  serious  concerns  over  reports  of  recent  and 
future  increases  in  the  contribution  factor,  which  has  pushed  the  entire  program 
closer  to  a  boiling  point.  The  Board  has  the  opportunity  and,  in  our  judgment,  the 
obligation, to suggest reforms and structural changes to the USF program that could 
result  in  long-term  solvency,  and  ensure  that  only  consumers  who  truly  need  the 
program’s  support  receive  it.  Failure  of  the  Board  to  make  the  difficult  decisions 
necessary at this critical juncture will reduce political support and sustainability of 
the  program.  We  urge  the  Board  to  make  the  tough  decisions  and  proposals  nec-
essary  to  place  the  program  on  a  new  course.  In  other  words,  it  is  time  to  be  bold. 
We strongly request that the Board recommend an overall cap on the entire USF 
program.  Last  year,  the  four  of  us  and  others  supported  an  amendment  to  a  tele-
communications  reform  bill  during  consideration  in  the  Senate  Commerce  Com-
mittee  that  would  have  capped  the  overall  USF  program.  We  believe  a  cap  would 
ensure  that  the  administrators  of  the  USF  program  spend  the  money  more  effec-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:14 May 07, 2012 Jkt 074012 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74012.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

tively  and  efficiently,  and  would  work  to  reduce  this  limitless  and  recurring  tax  on 
consumers. 

We do not support any plan that would cap only one select group of providers but 
not  others,  as  we  believe  such  a  fix  would  unfairly  skew  the  marketplace.  Instead, 
we reiterate the need for capping the overall program and doing so in a manner that 
does not pick winners and losers or favor one technology over another. We also urge 
you  not  to  use  interim  measures,  such  as  a  temporary  cap,  to  address  the  pressing 
issues  facing  the  USF  program.  Many  interim  measures  enacted  by  the  Federal 
Communications  Commission  in  the  past  have  lived  far  longer  than  intended  when 
proposed. 

While a cap on all USF program funding is truly needed, a cap is only as valuable 
as  the  corresponding  changes  made  to  the  USF  distribution  mechanism.  Funding 
multiple providers without a reduction in the level of support for existing providers 
losing  customers  has  put  the  Fund  on  an  uncontrollable  growth  pattern  that  will 
only  result  in  higher  telephone  bills  for  all  Americans.  If  this  is  not  addressed,  the 
USF  program  will  over  subsidize  some  markets  at  the  expense  of  those  markets 
most in need. 

In addition, we strongly recommend the Board give significant weight to a reverse 
auction  mechanism  for  distributing  USF  support.  This  can  be  done  in  a  number  of 
ways,  including  establishing  the  support  level  for  a  study  area,  state,  or  otherwise 
(i.e.,  maximum  price  support  point),  or  establishing  a  sole  provider  eligible  for  sup-
port  in  a  respective  market.  However  accomplished,  allowing  all  providers  to  take 
part of one unified auction in a market—not just a platform-specific proposal—to bid 
down support needed to serve particular consumers will reduce the total cost of the 
USF high-cost program. It will also bring much needed efficiency to the system, fa-
cilitate regulatory parity, allow for the emergence of new technologies to many mar-
kets, eliminate the distinction between rural and non-rural incumbent carriers, and 
instill necessary market-oriented solutions. 

In sum, the USF program has not kept pace with the remarkable innovation that 
has  occurred  in  the  communications  industry  over  the  last  few  years.  It  must  be 
dramatically  reformed  to  operate  in  a  way  that  best  serves  the  American  people. 
The Board must transform this program into one that takes in and distributes USF 
funds in a responsible manner that ensures Americans are not subjected to limitless 
increases  on  their  phone  bills.  We  respectfully  request  that  you  take  the  steps  nec-
essary to fully reform the USF program and reject short-term solvency solutions. 

We ask that this letter be handled in strict accordance with existing agency rules, 

regulations, and ethical guidelines. 

Sincerely, 

JOHN E. SUNUNU 
JOHN MCCAIN 
JIM DEMINT 
JOHN ENSIGN 

Senator SUNUNU. I think that a piecemeal approach like this one, 
it’s  not  necessarily  fair,  it  has  the  potential  to  skew  the  markets; 
but, two, it’s just passing these significant problems within the sys-
tem down the road. And, in many ways, I think it’s going to make 
it  harder  for  Congress  to  act  in  a  comprehensive  way.  I  think  it’s 
going  to  create  additional  inequities  in  the  system.  And  I  find  it 
somewhat disappointing. The Joint Board has said, ‘‘We’re going to 
recommend  a  more  comprehensive  approach  in  6  months.’’  That 
brings  us  really  to  the  heart  of  a  2008  campaign  season,  and, 
frankly,  I  think  that  is  highly  unlikely.  I  hope  we  hear,  today,  not 
just from Commissioner Tate, but from other stakeholders and par-
ticipants, some very specific ideas about how to enact additional re-
forms,  what  really  needs  to  be  done  to  make  sure  this  program 
works  effectively  for  those  it  was  intended,  and  how  and  why  we 
should  have  confidence  that  the  costs  of  the  program  aren’t  going 
to  simply  continue  to  accelerate  and  continue  to  be  passed  on  to 
consumers.  A  10  percent  or  12  percent  or  15  percent  surcharge  on 
interstate calls is pretty significant, and that’s levied on every con-
sumer  in  America.  And  when  you’re  assessing  surcharges  that 
high,  you  ought  to  be  delivering  something  that’s  measurable,

that’s  tangible,  and  something  that’s  going  to  those  people  that 
need it most. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator  STEVENS.  Senator  Pryor,  did  you  have  a  statement  you 

wished to make? 

Senator PRYOR. I don’t. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator STEVENS. Thank you very much. 
Our  first  witness  is  the  Honorable  Deborah  Taylor  Tate,  Com-

missioner of the FCC. We’re pleased to have your statement. 

STATEMENT OF HON. DEBORAH TAYLOR TATE, 

COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION; 

AND CHAIR, FEDERAL-STATE JOINT BOARD 

ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE 

Ms. TATE. Thank you, Vice Chairman Stevens and distinguished 

Members of the Committee. 

I  do  welcome  the  opportunity  to  be  here  to  testify  today  and  to 
talk  with  you  all  as  the  Federal  Chair  of  the  Joint  Board  on  Uni-
versal  Service  regarding  our  recent  consensus  recommendation  of 
the Joint Board, that the FCC take immediate action to rein in the 
explosive  growth  in  the  high-cost  Universal  Service  support  dis-
bursements.  Like  many  of  you  all,  I’m  from  a  rural  state,  and  I’ve 
seen and experienced, firsthand, opportunities that are provided by 
Universal Service in those rural areas. I’ve told you all before that 
I remember the day the telephone wire was rolled up a gravel road 
to my grandmother’s house in rural Tennessee, an event that likely 
would not have occurred without Universal Service. 

I now have the distinct honor and responsibility and privilege to 
help design and implement policies that will preserve and advance 
Universal Service for all Americans. 

I  think  we  all  agree  a  modern  and  high-quality  communications 
infrastructure is essential to ensure all Americans, especially those 
living  in  rural  communities,  have  access  to  the  full  array  of  edu-
cational,  economic,  and  other  opportunities  that  are  delivered  via 
advanced  services.  Indeed,  Congress—you  all—have  directed  con-
sumers in all regions of the Nation have access to reasonably com-
parable  telecommunications  services,  including  advanced  services, 
at comparable rates. 

As we look to achieve the long-term goals of the Universal Serv-
ice  program,  as  you  all  have  mentioned,  including  deployment  of 
those  advanced  services,  we  must  recognize  how  technological 
changes are putting strains on the mechanics of both the contribu-
tion  and  distribution  systems.  The  high-cost  support  mechanism 
alone  has  grown  from  about  $2.6  billion  in  the  year  2000  to  ap-
proximately  $4  billion  in  2006,  placing  significant  pressure  on  the 
stability of the Fund. 

This  growth  was  largely  due  to  increased  support  provided  to 
multiple  competitive  eligible  telecommunications  carriers,  CETCs, 
as  illustrated  in  this  series  of  charts.  As  you  can  see  from  Chart 
1,  since  2003,  incumbent  LEC  payments  have  been  relatively  flat, 
the dark blue—you can see how flat that line is—and actually have 
even  begun  to  start  downward.  On  the  other  hand,  Chart  1  also 
shows that almost all of the recent growth in the high-cost support 
is largely as a result of distributions to CETCs.

6 

As  Chart  2  shows,  the  CETC  high-cost  distributions  have  been 
growing at a rate trend of 101 percent per year since 2002. Specifi-
cally,  in  2000  CETCs  received  a  million  dollars,  and,  according  to 
USAC, now receive almost a billion, in 2006. 

Chart  3  shows  the  rapid  year-over-year  dollar  growth  of  CETC 
payments.  This  chart  highlights  another  problem  with  the  current 
system, CETCs presently receive high-cost support based on the in-
cumbent LEC’s embedded cost, or per-line support amount that the 
LEC receives, rather than on their own costs. 

Overall,  these  charts  illustrate  our  current  high-cost  mechanism 
is  in  need  of  repair  and  revision.  As  stewards  of  public  funds,  our 
obligation  is  to  preserve  and  advance  Universal  Service.  It  man-
dates  immediate  action  to  stem  this  explosive  growth  in  the  high- 
cost support, while doing all we can to move quickly toward funda-
mental reform to ensure that quality services are, indeed, available 
to all of our citizens. 

I would have preferred, and hoped, the Joint Board act more im-
mediately to fundamentally reform the high-cost distribution mech-
anism. Unfortunately, I was not able to move us to a consensus on 
that  point.  The  Joint  Board  was,  however,  able  to  reach  a  con-
sensus on an interim step. Seven out of eight members of the Joint 
Board agreed an interim emergency cap on the amount of high-cost 
support  that  CETCs  receive  for  each  state,  based  on  2006  support 
levels, was required to stabilize the high-cost fund while the Board 
and  the  FCC  further  explore  comprehensive  high-cost  distribution 
reform. 

The  Recommended  Decision  and  its  companion  Public  Notice 
made clear the Joint Board is totally committed to making further 
recommendations,  as  the  Senator  noted,  by  November  1st,  within 
6  months  of  our  decision.  Whether  through  reverse  auctions  or 
some  other  cost-effective  mechanism,  a  fundamental  reform  plan 
will  ensure  that  Universal  Service  promotes  the  availability  of 
services  at  reasonably  comparable  rates  throughout  the  country; 
hopefully, in a technologically and competitively neutral manner. 

Comprehensive  reform  also  must  take  into  account  areas  of  our 
country  that  are  uniquely  situated.  For  example,  any  comprehen-
sive reform plan, by necessity, must continue the Commission’s tra-
ditional  recognition  that  there  are  underserved  lands.  Tribal  lands 
in  the  Lower  48,  in  Alaska  Native  Regions,  are  uniquely  situated 
and  deserving  of  individual  treatment  to  ensure  that  they  are  not 
left behind. 

I  hope  to  continue  to  facilitate  these  discussions  between  you, 
this  Committee,  Congress,  the  Commission,  and,  of  course,  mem-
bers  of  the  Joint  Board,  while  doing  all  we  can  to  preserve  the 
Fund and ensure these services are available to consumers no mat-
ter where they choose to live. 

Thank you, again, for the opportunity to discuss these important 

issues, and, of course, I’m pleased to answer questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON.  DEBORAH TAYLOR TATE,  COMMISSIONER, 
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION;  AND CHAIR,  FEDERAL-STATE JOINT 
BOARD ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE 
Good  morning,  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  and  distinguished 
Members of the Committee. I welcome the opportunity to testify today on the recent 
recommendation of the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service (Joint Board) 
to  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC  or  Commission).  Like  many  of 
you, I have seen and experienced firsthand the opportunities provided by Universal 
Service  in  very  rural  areas.  I  remember  the  day  the  telephone  wire  was  rolled  up 
a  gravel  road  to  my  grandmother’s  house  in  rural  Tennessee—an  event  that  likely 
would  not  have  occurred  without  a  Universal  Service  program.  As  a  Commissioner 
and  the  Federal  Chair  of  the  Joint  Board,  I  now  have  the  honor  and  responsibility 
to  help  design  and  implement  policies  that  will  preserve  and  advance  Universal 
Service to all Americans. 

All  of  the  Joint  Board  members—FCC  Chairman  Kevin  Martin,  FCC  Commis-
sioner Michael Copps, Commissioner and Joint Board State Chair Ray Baum of Or-
egon, Chairman Lisa Edgar of Florida, Commissioner Larry Landis of Indiana, Com-
missioner  John  Burke  of  Vermont,  and  Director  Billy  Jack  Gregg  of  the  Consumer 
Advocate  Division  of  West  Virginia—deserve  praise  for  their  commitment  to  ad-
dressing  these  complex  issues  in  addition  to  their  full  time  jobs  as  Federal  or  state 
government officials. I should also thank the members of the state and Federal staff 
whose  dedication  and  professionalism  reflect  the  highest  ideal  of  government  serv-
ice. 

Congress  directed  the  FCC  to  institute  the  Joint  Board  ‘‘to  recommend  changes 
to  any  of  [the  FCC’s]  regulations  in  order  to  implement  sections  214(e)  and  [254]’’ 
of the Act. The Commission has referred a number of issues to the Joint Board and 
relied heavily on its recommendations. Most relevant to the subject of today’s hear-
ing, the Commission in 2002 asked the Joint Board to review Commission rules re-
lated to the high-cost Universal Service support mechanisms.1 Among other things, 
the  Commission  asked  the  Joint  Board  to  review  the  Commission’s  rules  relating 
to high-cost Universal Service support in study areas in which a competitive eligible 
telecommunications  carrier  (CETC)  is  providing  service.2 In  response,  the  Joint 
Board recommended, inter alia, that the Commission implement a ‘‘primary line’’ re-
striction  limiting  the  scope  of  high-cost  support  for  each  household  to  a  single  con-
nection  that  provides  access  to  the  public  telephone  network.  The  Joint  Board  also 
made  a  number  of  recommendations  concerning  the  designation  of  eligible  tele-
communications  carrier  (ETCs)  in  high-cost  areas,  but  declined  to  recommend  that 
the Commission modify the basis of support (i.e., the methodology used to calculate 
support) in study areas with multiple ETCs.3 Instead, the Joint Board recommended 
that  it  and  the  Commission  consider  possible  modifications  to  the  basis  of  support 
for  CETCs  as  part  of  an  overall  review  of  the  high-cost  support  mechanisms  for 
rural and non-rural carriers.4 

In 2004, the Commission asked the Joint Board to review, inter alia, the Commis-
sion’s rules relating to the high-cost Universal Service support mechanisms for rural 
carriers  and  to  determine  the  appropriate  rural  mechanism  to  succeed  the  plan 
adopted  in  the  Rural  Task  Force  Order.5 In  August  2004,  the  Joint  Board  sought 
comment on issues the Commission referred to it related to the high-cost Universal 
Service  support  mechanisms  for  rural  carriers.6 The  Joint  Board  also  specifically 
sought comment on the methodology for calculating support for ETCs in competitive 
study  areas.7 Since  that  time,  the  Joint  Board  has  sought  comment  on  a  variety  of 
specific  proposals  for  addressing  the  issues  of  Universal  Service  support  for  rural 
carriers  and  the  basis  of  support  for  competitive  ETCs,  including  proposals  devel-
oped by members and staff of the Joint Board and the use of reverse auctions (com-
petitive bidding) to determine high-cost Universal Service funding to ETCs.8 

Since I was named the Chair of the Joint Board in 2006, the Joint Board has con-
tinued  its  work  to  review  the  Universal  Service  policies  and  respond  to  the  FCC’s 
referrals. I have been committed to keeping our work on a timetable paced to fulfill 
our  statutory  role  in  a  thoughtful  and  deliberative  manner.  The  Joint  Board  has 
held  a  number  of  face-to-face  meetings,  countless  conference  calls,  issued  notices 
and  referrals,  and  reviewed  hundreds  of  comments  from  interested  parties.  The 
Joint  Board  staff  held  a  retreat  for  3  days  in  June  2006  to  review  outstanding  and 
new proposals, and the Joint Board met in August 2006 during the NARUC summer 
meeting.  On  August  11,  2006,  the  Joint  Board  issued  a  Public  Notice  and  sought 
comment  on  primary  questions,  such  as  the  overall  appropriateness  and  legality  of 
implementing  reverse  auctions,  as  well  as  questions  about  the  mechanics  of  imple-
menting  reverse  auctions,  such  as  the  role  of  Federal  and  state  jurisdictional  roles, 
defining quality of service obligations, and the unique questions regarding the treat-

ment of incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs). The Joint Board received numer-
ous  comments  and  reply  comments  last  fall,  and  also  received  additional  submis-
sions in the record. 

In  September  2006,  because  there  were  several  newer  members  of  the  Joint 
Board,  including  myself,  the  Joint  Board  hosted  a  two-day  meeting  at  the  FCC  fo-
cusing  on  training.  We  heard  from  the  Universal  Service  Administrative  Company 
(USAC), the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA), and FCC staff experts 
about  the  mechanics  of  the  Universal  Service  programs.  The  state  members  of  the 
Joint Board and staff met again in November 2006 during the NARUC winter meet-
ings. Further, on February 20, 2007, as a part of its en banc hearing in Washington, 
D.C., the Joint Board heard from a number of experts, including witnesses from the 
National  Telecommunications  Cooperative  Association,  Verizon,  and  CTIA—The 
Wireless Association, discussing specific proposals, benefits, and concerns regarding 
reverse  auctions.  The  Joint  Board  also  heard  from  experts  on  geo-spatial  mapping 
and  approaches  to  more  effectively  targeting  the  distribution  of  support,  including 
witnesses from the Polis Center in Indianapolis, CostQuest Associates, and Embarq. 
We were pleased that members of your staffs attended as well. 

It became clear to the Joint Board during the course of its deliberations that high- 
cost  support  has  been  rapidly  increasing  in  recent  years,  largely  due  to  increased 
support provided to CETCs. According to FCC and USAC data, in the 6 years from 
2001  through  2006,  CETC  support  grew  from  $15  million  to  almost  $1  billion—an 
annual growth rate of over 100 percent. Over the same time period the USF support 
to  the  incumbent  local  exchange  carriers  serving  high-cost  rural  areas  under  the 
Fund has leveled out. 

Based  on  current  estimates,  CETC  support  in  2007  will  reach  at  least  $1.28  bil-
lion  absent  Commission  action.  Moreover,  if  the  Commission  were  now  to  approve 
all  33  CETC  petitions  currently  pending  before  the  Commission,  high-cost  support 
for CETCs could rise to as much as $1.56 billion in 2007. This does not include the 
financial  impact  of  the  approximately  35  additional  CETC  applications  that  are 
pending or have been approved by the states since the beginning of 2007. High-cost 
support to CETCs is estimated to grow to almost $2 billion in 2008 and $2.5 billion 
in 2009 even without additional CETC designations in 2008 and 2009. 

This  growth  is  not  only  due  to  multiple  providers  receiving  high-cost  support  in 
many study areas, but also because CETCs receive Universal Service support based 
on  the  incumbent  LEC’s  embedded  costs  or  the  per  line  support  amount  that  the 
incumbent  LEC  receives.  But  as  we  heard  at  the  en  banc,  a  CETC’s  actual  costs 
are likely to be very different, and perhaps lower, than the incumbent telephone car-
rier’s costs on a per line basis. 

In light of those facts, the Joint Board reached a consensus that immediate action 
was required to stabilize the high-cost fund. On May 1, 2007, the Joint Board issued 
a  Recommended  Decision  advocating  that  the  Commission  adopt  an  interim  emer-
gency cap on the amount of high-cost support that CETCs may receive for each state 
based on 2006 support levels.9 The Commission issued a Public Notice seeking com-
ment  on  the  Joint  Board’s  recommendation  on  May  14,  2007.  The  Commission  re-
ceived  over  60  comments  on  June  6,  2007,  and  reply  comments  are  due  June  13, 
2007. 

The  Joint  Board  also  recommended  that  both  it  and  the  Commission  further  ex-
plore  comprehensive  high-cost  distribution  reform,  and  sought  comment  on  various 
reform proposals in a Public Notice released on the same day as the Recommended 
Decision.10 

The Recommended Decision and its companion Public Notice make clear that the 
Joint Board is committed to making further recommendations regarding comprehen-
sive  high-cost  Universal  Service  reform  by  November  1,  2007.  I  am  committed,  as 
the  Federal  Chair,  to  putting  the  Joint  Board  in  a  position  to  make  those  rec-
ommendations. 

As  we  look  to  achieve  the  long-term  goals  of  the  Universal  Service  program,  we 
must  balance  the  goal  of  encouraging  competitive  entry  with  the  other  challenges, 
such  as  the  further  deployment  of  advanced  services.  It  is  essential  that  we  recog-
nize how technological changes are putting strains on the mechanics of our contribu-
tion  and  distribution  systems.  As  stewards  of  public  funds,  our  obligation  to  pre-
serve  and  advance  Universal  Service  mandates  that  we  recommend  immediate  ac-
tion  to  stem  the  explosive  growth  in  high-cost  Universal  Service  support  disburse-
ments, while doing all we can to achieve fundamental reform to ensure that afford-
able, quality services are available to consumers all across the country. 

As Chair of the Joint Board, my goal has been to encourage discussion among my 
colleagues  and  facilitate  consensus  that  will  ensure  that  American  consumers 
throughout the Nation continue to have access to an evolving level of services. Every 
member of this Joint Board supports the principles of Universal Service: to promote

the  availability  of  quality  services  at  just,  reasonable,  and  affordable  rates;  to  in-
crease  access  to  advanced  telecommunications  services  throughout  the  Nation;  and 
to  advance  the  availability  of  such  services  to  all  consumers.  Our  recommendation 
is a step toward more fully implementing those principles. I look forward to working 
with  my  Federal  and  state  colleagues  and  with  all  stakeholders  as  we  continue  to 
make progress. 

Again, I appreciate your invitation to be here with you today. I am pleased to an-

swer any questions you may have.

FEDERAL-STATE JOINT BOARD OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE RECOMMENDED DECISION 

Before the Federal Communications Commission 

Washington, DC 

In the Matter of High-Cost Universal Service Support 
Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service 
WC Docket No. 05–337 
CC Docket No. 96–45 Service 

Recommended Decision 

Adopted: April 26, 2007 
Released: May 1, 2007 

By  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service:  Chairman  Martin,  Com-
missioner  Tate,  Chairman  Edgar,  Commissioner  Landis,  and  Commissioner  Burke 
issuing  separate  statements;  Director  Gregg  concurring;  Commissioner  Baum  con-
curring  and  issuing  a  statement;  Commissioner  Copps  dissenting  and  issuing  a 
statement. 
I. Introduction 

1.  In  this  Recommended  Decision,  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal 
Service  (Joint  Board)  recommends  that  the  Commission  take  immediate  action  to 
rein  in  the  explosive  growth  in  high-cost  Universal  Service  support  disbursements. 
Specifically, we recommend that the Commission impose an interim, emergency cap 
on the amount of high-cost support that competitive eligible telecommunications car-
riers  (ETCs)  may  receive  for  each  state  based  on  the  average  level  of  competitive 
ETC support distributed in that state in 2006.11 We also recommend that the Joint 
Board and the Commission further explore comprehensive high-cost distribution re-
form.  As  part  of  that  effort,  today  in  a  companion  Public  Notice  we  seek  comment 
on  various  proposals  to  reform  the  high-cost  Universal  Service  support  mecha-
nisms.12 We also commit to making further recommendations regarding comprehen-
sive high-cost Universal Service reform within 6 months of this Recommended Deci-
sion. Finally, we recommend that the Commission act on these further recommenda-
tions within 1 year from the date of our further Recommended Decision. 
II. Background 

2.  In  2002,  the  Commission  asked  the  Joint  Board  to  review  certain  of  the  Com-
mission’s  rules  related  to  the  high-cost  Universal  Service  support  mechanisms.13 
Among other things, the Commission asked the Joint Board to review the Commis-
sion’s  rules  relating  to  high-cost  Universal  Service  support  in  study  areas  in  which 
a  competitive  ETC  is  providing  service.14 In  response,  the  Joint  Board  made  many 
recommendations  concerning  the  designation  of  ETCs  in  high-cost  areas,  but  de-
clined  to  recommend  that  the  Commission  modify  the  basis  of  support  (i.e.,  the 
methodology  used  to  calculate  support)  in  study  areas  with  multiple  ETCs.15 In-
stead,  the  Joint  Board  recommended  that  it  and  the  Commission  consider  possible 
modifications  to  the  basis  of  support  for  competitive  ETCs  as  part  of  an  overall  re-
view of the high-cost support mechanisms for rural and non-rural carriers.16 

3.  In  2004,  the  Commission  asked  the  Joint  Board  to  review  the  Commission’s 
rules  relating  to  the  high-cost  Universal  Service  support  mechanisms  for  rural  car-
riers and to determine the appropriate rural mechanism to succeed the plan adopted 
in the Rural Task Force Order.17 In August 2004, the Joint Board sought comment 
on  issues  the  Commission  referred  to  it  related  to  the  high-cost  Universal  Service 
support  mechanisms  for  rural  carriers.18 The  Joint  Board  also  specifically  sought 
comment  on  the  methodology  for  calculating  support  for  ETCs  in  competitive  study 
areas.19 Since  that  time,  the  Joint  Board  has  sought  comment  on  a  variety  of  spe-

cific  proposals  for  addressing  the  issues  of  Universal  Service  support  for  rural  car-
riers  and  the  basis  of  support  for  competitive  ETCs,  including  proposals  developed 
by  members  and  staff  of  the  Joint  Board  and  the  use  of  reverse  auctions  (competi-
tive bidding) to determine high-cost Universal Service funding to ETCs.20 
III.  Recommendation  for  an  Immediate  Interim  Cap  on  Support  for 

Competitive Eligible Telecommunications Carriers 

A. Need for Immediate Action 

4. High-cost support has been rapidly increasing in recent years and, without im-
mediate  action  to  restrain  growth  in  competitive  ETC  funding,  the  Federal  Uni-
versal Service Fund is in dire jeopardy of becoming unsustainable.21 Today, the Uni-
versal  Service  Fund  provides  approximately  $4  billion  per  year  in  high-cost  sup-
port.22 Yet, in 2001 high-cost support totaled approximately $2.6 billion.23 In recent 
years, this growth has been due to increased support provided to competitive ETCs 
which  receive  high-cost  support  based  on  the  per-line  support  that  the  incumbent 
local exchange carriers (LECs) receive rather than the competitive ETC’s own costs. 
While  support  to  incumbent  LECs  has  been  flat  or  even  declined  since  2003,24 by 
contrast,  in  the  6  years  from  2001  through  2006,  competitive  ETC  support  grew 
from  $15  million  to  almost  $1  billion—an  annual  growth  rate  of  over  100  percent. 
Based  on  current  estimates,  competitive  ETC  support  in  2007  will  reach  at  least 
$1.28  billion  if  the  Commission  takes  no  action  to  curtail  this  growth.  Moreover,  if 
the Commission were now to approve all competitive ETC petitions currently pend-
ing  before  the  Commission,  high-cost  support  for  competitive  ETCs  could  rise  to  as 
much as $1.56 billion in 2007.25 High-cost support to competitive ETCs is estimated 
to grow to almost $2 billion in 2008 and $2.5 billion in 2009 even without additional 
competitive ETC designations in 2008 and 2009.26 

5. We conclude that immediate action must be taken to stem the dramatic growth 
in high-cost support. We therefore recommend that the Commission immediately im-
pose  an  interim  cap  on  high-cost  support  provided  to  competitive  ETCs  until  such 
measures  can  be  adopted  that  will  ensure  that  the  Fund  will  be  sustainable  for  fu-
ture  years.  We  believe  that  taking  this  action  will  prevent  increases  in  high-cost 
support due to the designation of additional competitive ETCs or line growth among 
existing competitive ETCs. While imposition of the interim cap will not address the 
current  disproportionate  distribution  of  competitive  ETC  support  among  the 
states,27 the cap will stop growth in competitive ETC support while the Joint Board 
and  the  Commission  consider  fundamental  reforms  to  address  issues  related  to  the 
distribution  of  support.  At  this  time,  we  do  not  recommend  additional  caps  on  sup-
port provided to incumbent LECs, because the data show less growth pressure from 
incumbent  LECs.  Moreover,  incumbent  LEC  high-cost  loop  support  is  already 
capped  and  incumbent  interstate  access  support  has  a  targeted  limit.28 Also,  local 
switching support and interstate common line support provided to incumbent LECs 
have been stable in recent years.29 Accordingly, we recommend that the Commission 
immediately  impose  an  interim  high-cost  support  cap,  but  one  that  is  limited  to 
high-cost support provided to competitive ETCs. 

6. We believe that adopting an interim cap on high-cost support only for competi-
tive  ETCs  would  not  violate  the  Commission’s  Universal  Service  principle  of  com-
petitive neutrality for several reasons.30 Fundamental differences exist between the 
regulatory  treatment  of  competitive  ETCs  and  incumbent  LECs.  For  example,  com-
petitive  ETCs,  unlike  incumbent  LECs,  have  no  equal  access  obligations.  Competi-
tive ETCs also are not subject to rate regulation. In addition, competitive ETCs may 
not have the same carrier of last resort obligations that incumbent LECs have. Fur-
thermore, under the identical support rule, both incumbent rural LECs and competi-
tive ETCs receive support based on the incumbent rural LECs’ costs. Therefore, in-
cumbent  rural  LECs’  support  is  cost-based,  while  competitive  ETCs’  support  is  not. 
Due to this, as discussed below, we recommend that the Commission consider aban-
doning the identical support rule in any comprehensive and fundamental reform ul-
timately adopted.31 

7.  We  decline  to  recommend  that  the  Commission  adopt  General  Communication 
Inc.’s (GCI) proposal that we exempt wireline competitive ETCs from the cap.32 The 
growth of support to wireless competitive ETCs may indeed have been much greater 
than  the  growth  of  support  to  wireline  competitive  ETCs.  However,  we  recommend 
a cap today largely because we conclude that the identical support rule has become 
dated  and  may  no  longer  be  the  most  appropriate  approach  to  calculating  support 
for  competitive  ETCs.  Today  wireline  competitive  ETCs  (such  as  GCI)  and  wireless 
competitive  ETCs  both  derive  their  Universal  Service  support  from  the  identical 
support  rule.  Neither  receives  support  based  on  its  own  costs.  In  addition,  GCI 
would have us create an exemption based upon the ETC’s chosen technology, rather 
than  its  legal  status.  We  are  not  aware  of  anything  in  the  Commission’s  current 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:14 May 07, 2012 Jkt 074012 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74012.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

11 

rules  that  provides  a  precedent  for  such  a  technology-based  differentiation  within 
Universal Service policy. 
B. Length of Time 

8.  We  emphasize  that  the  cap  on  competitive  ETC  support  that  we  recommend 
here should be an interim measure that is used to stem the growing crisis in high- 
cost support growth while the Commission and the Joint Board consider further re-
form.  We  remain  committed  to  comprehensive  reform  of  the  high-cost  Universal 
Service  support  mechanisms.  Accordingly,  we  recommend  that  the  Commission  im-
mediately adopt an interim cap on high-cost support to competitive ETCs, and that 
the  cap  expire  1  year  from  the  date  of  any  Joint  Board  recommended  decision  on 
comprehensive  and  fundamental  Universal  Service  reform.  As  discussed  below,  we 
commit  to  adoption  of  a  further  recommended  decision  addressing  fundamental 
high-cost reforms within 6 months of today’s Recommended Decision. We also antici-
pate  that  the  Commission  will  act  promptly  on  the  Joint  Board’s  subsequent  rec-
ommended  decision  in  light  of  the  interim  nature  of  the  cap,  notwithstanding  the 
fact that the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act) imposes a one-year 
time limit on such action.33 
C. Operation of the Cap 

9. We recommend that the Commission immediately impose a cap on competitive 
ETC  support  for  each  state.  We  believe  that  a  competitive  ETC  cap  applied  at  a 
state  level  effectively  curbs  growth  but  allows  states  some  flexibility  to  direct  com-
petitive  ETC  support  to  the  areas  in  the  state  that  are  most  in  need  of  such  sup-
port.34 An  interim,  state-based  cap  on  competitive  ETC  support  will  also  avoid  cre-
ating  an  incentive  for  each  state  to  designate  as  many  new  ETCs  as  possible.  A 
state-based  cap  will  require  newly  designated  competitive  ETCs  to  share  funding 
with other competitive ETCs within the state. 

10. Under the proposed state-based cap, support would be calculated using a two- 
step  approach.  First,  on  a  quarterly  basis,  the  Universal  Service  Administrative 
Company (USAC) would calculate the support each competitive ETC would have re-
ceived  under  the  existing  (uncapped)  equal  per-line  support  rule  and  would  sum 
these amounts by state.35 Second, USAC would calculate a state reduction factor to 
reduce  this  amount  to  the  competitive  ETC  cap.  Specifically,  USAC  would  compare 
the  total  amount  of  uncapped  support  to  the  cap  amount  for  each  state.  Where  the 
total state uncapped support is greater than the available state cap support amount, 
USAC  would  divide  the  state  cap  support  amount  by  the  total  state  uncapped 
amount to yield the state reduction factor. USAC would then apply the state-specific 
reduction factor to the uncapped amount for each competitive ETC within the state 
to arrive at the capped level of high-cost support. Where the state uncapped support 
is  less  than  the  available  state  capped  support  amount,  no  reduction  would  be  re-
quired. 

11.  For  example,  if  in  State  A,  the  capped  amount  is  $90  million  and  the  total 
uncapped  support  is  $130  million,  the  reduction  factor  would  be  69.2  percent  ($90/ 
$130). In State A, each competitive ETC’s support would be multiplied by 69.2 per-
cent to reduce support to the capped amount. If in State B, however, the base period 
capped amount is $100 million and the total uncapped support is $95 million, there 
would  be  no  reduction  factor  because  the  uncapped  amount  is  less  than  the  capped 
amount. Each quarter, for the duration of the cap, a new reduction factor would be 
calculated  for  each  state.  Finally,  if  in  State  C  the  base  period  capped  amount  is 
$0  (i.e.,  there  were  no  competitive  ETCs  receiving  support  in  State  C  as  of  when 
the cap was established), then no competitive ETCs would be eligible to receive sup-
port in that state. 

12.  Although  the  competitive  ETC  cap  retains  the  so-called  identical  support  or 
portability  rule  in  the  first  step  of  calculating  capped  support  amounts,  the  Joint 
Board recommends that the Commission consider abandoning or modifying this rule 
in any comprehensive reform it ultimately adopts. The identical support rule seems 
to  be  one  of  the  primary  causes  of  the  explosive  growth  in  the  fund.  Most  of  the 
reform  options  that  we  seek  comment  on  in  today’s  companion  Public  Notice  would 
replace  this  approach  with  approaches  that  better  reflect  the  economic  realities  of 
different  technologies.36 Thus,  we  recommend  that  the  Commission  expressly  place 
competitive  ETCs  on  notice  that  identical  support  without  cost  justification  may  be 
an outdated approach to USF funding. 
D. Base Period for the Cap 

13.  We  recommend  that  the  Commission  cap  competitive  ETC  support  for  each 
state  at  the  level  of  competitive  ETC  support  actually  distributed  in  that  state  in 
2006. Although this approach likely results in a lower cap in most jurisdictions than 
the  level  of  support  that  is  being  distributed  in  2007,  we  find  that  the  need  for

12 

adopting this emergency interim cap to stabilize support for competitive ETCs iden-
tified  above  justifies  using  2006  support  levels.37 Moreover,  using  2006  data  allows 
the  Commission  to  use  actual  support  amounts,  rather  than  relying  on  USAC  pro-
jections  to  set  the  cap  amounts.  By  using  actual  distributions  over  four  quarters  of 
2006,  the  Commission  will  be  able  to  smooth  out  any  seasonal  or  one-time  fluctua-
tions  that  may  be  reflected  in  any  single  quarter.38 Consistent  with  our  rec-
ommendation  to  cap  competitive  ETC  support  on  an  interim  basis,  we  find  that 
there is no need to index the cap to a growth factor. 
IV. Fundamental High-Cost Distribution Reform 

14.  The  imposition  of  an  interim  cap  on  competitive  ETC  high-cost  support  rep-
resents only a temporary solution to the problems that plague the high-cost support 
distribution  mechanisms.  As  noted  above,  we  are  committed  to  making  further  rec-
ommendations  regarding  comprehensive  high-cost  Universal  Service  reform  within 
6 months. So that we may accomplish that goal, we seek comment, in a companion 
Public  Notice,  on  several  proposals  that  have  been  placed  in  the  record  since  the 
close of the last comment cycle, as well as other possible reforms.39 Specifically, we 
seek  comment  on  proposals  related  to  the  use  of  reverse  auctions,  the  use  of  geo-
graphic  information  systems  (GIS)  technology,  the  disaggregation  of  high-cost  sup-
port, and support for broadband services.40 As we state in the Public Notice, we ex-
pect  parties  to  submit  comprehensive  reform  proposals  pursuant  to  the  pleading 
cycle set forth in the Public Notice.41 
V. Recommending Clause 

15. For the reasons discussed herein, the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal 
Service,  pursuant  to  sections  254(a)(1)  and  410(c)  of  the  Communications  Act  of 
1934,  as  amended,  47  U.S.C.  §§ 254(a)(1),  410(c),  recommends  that  the  Commission 
adopt recommendations set forth herein concerning an interim cap on high-cost Uni-
versal Service support for competitive ETCs.

STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN KEVIN J. MARTIN 

In  the  Matter  of  High-Cost  Universal  Service  Support,  WC  Docket  No.  05–337; 

Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, CC Docket No. 96–45 

I  am  pleased  that  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service  rec-
ommends measures to the Commission to address the rapid growth in the high-cost 
Universal  Service  program.  It  is  essential  that  we  take  actions  that  preserve  and 
advance the benefits of the Universal Service program. 

The United States and the Commission have a long history and tradition of mak-
ing  sure  that  rural  areas  of  the  country  are  connected  and  have  similar  opportuni-
ties  for  communications  as  other  areas.  I  believe  our  Universal  Service  program 
must  continue  to  promote  investment  in  rural  America’s  infrastructure  and  ensure 
access  to  telecommunications  services  that  are  comparable  to  those  available  in 
urban  areas  today,  as  well  as  provide  a  platform  for  delivery  of  advanced  services. 
Changes  in  technology  and  increases  in  the  number  of  carriers  that  receive  Uni-
versal Service support, however, have placed significant pressure on the stability of 
the  Fund.  A  large  and  rapidly  growing  portion  of  the  high-cost  support  program  is 
now  devoted  to  supporting  multiple  competitors  to  serve  areas  in  which  costs  are 
prohibitively  expensive  for  even  one  carrier.  These  additional  networks  in  high-cost 
areas  don’t  receive  support  based  on  their  own  costs,  but  rather  on  the  costs  of  the 
incumbent  provider,  even  if  their  cost  of  providing  service  is  lower.  The  Rec-
ommended Decision emphasizes the problems of maintaining the equal support rule. 
The  recommendation  also  caps  competitive  ETC  funding  to  address  the  escalating 
impact  of  this  problem.  I  would  argue  that  if  a  competitive  ETC  can  demonstrate 
that its costs meet the support threshold in the same manner as the rural provider, 
the competitive ETC should receive support, despite the cap. Thus, a preferable rule 
would  be  to  cap  those  providers  that  do  not  receive  support  based  on  their  own 
costs. 

Today’s  recommendation  is  not  an  end  in  itself,  but  rather  signals  the  need  for 
comprehensive  reform.  Among  the  reform  ideas  the  Joint  Board  continues  to  con-
sider is the use of reverse auctions (competitive bidding for support in defined areas) 
to  determine  high-cost  Universal  Service  funding  for  eligible  telecommunications 
carriers. I believe that reverse auctions could provide a technologically and competi-
tively  neutral  means  of  controlling  the  current  unsustainable  growth  in  the  Fund 
and ensuring a move to most efficient technology over time. Although the use of re-
verse  auctions  is  one  way  of  limiting  the  growth  of  the  fund,  I  will  give  any  rec-
ommendation  submitted  by  the  Joint  Board  my  full  consideration  and  remain  open 
to  other  ideas  that  could  restrain  fund  growth  and  prioritize  investment  in  rural 
and high-cost areas of the country. 

I  look  forward  to  working  with  my  colleagues  at  the  Commission  to  address  the 
Joint Board recommendation in a timely manner. I also look forward to a continued 
dialogue  with  my  Joint  Board  colleagues  as  the  Joint  Board  continues  to  address 
comprehensive and fundamental reform. 

STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER DEBORAH TAYLOR TATE 

In  the  Matter  of  High-Cost  Universal  Service  Support,  WC  Docket  No.  05–337; 

Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, CC Docket No. 96–45 

Congress  directed  the  Commission  to  institute  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on 
Universal  Service  so  that  the  Joint  Board  could  recommend  necessary  changes  to 
the  Commission’s  regulations.  As  stewards  of  public  funds,  our  obligation  to  pre-
serve  and  advance  Universal  Service  mandates  that  we  recommend  immediate 
changes  to  stem  the  explosive  growth  in  high-cost  Universal  Service  support  dis-
bursements. I am proud of the consensus achieved by this Joint Board in fulfillment 
of its duties. 

This  interim  action  is  just  that:  interim.  As  the  Recommended  Decision  and  its 
companion  Public  Notice  make  clear,  the  Joint  Board  is  committed  to  making  fur-
ther  recommendations  regarding  comprehensive  high-cost  Universal  Service  reform 
within  6  months  of  this  Recommended  Decision.  I  am  committed,  as  the  Federal 
Chair, to putting the Joint Board in a position to make those recommendations. 

Every  member  of  this  Joint  Board  supports  the  principles  of  Universal  Service: 
to  promote  the  availability  of  quality  services  at  just,  reasonable,  and  affordable 
rates;  to  increase  access  to  advanced  telecommunications  services  throughout  the 
Nation;  and  to  advance  the  availability  of  such  services  to  all  consumers.  Our  rec-
ommendation  today  is  a  step  toward  more  fully  implementing  those  principles.  I 
look  forward  to  working  with  my  Federal  and  state  colleagues  and  with  all  stake-
holders as we continue to make progress.

CONCURRING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN LISA POLAK EDGAR 

In  the  Matter  of  High-Cost  Universal  Service  Support,  WC  Docket  No.  05–337; 

Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, CC Docket No. 96–45 

I support the Recommended Decision and the accompanying Public Notice. 
Rapid  growth  in  the  Universal  Service  High-Cost  Fund  is  placing  unprecedented 
financial  pressure  on  consumers  of  telecommunications  services  and  the  Federal- 
State Joint Board on Universal Service today takes a necessary step to address that 
unplanned and exceptional growth. 

The  cap  detailed  in  today’s  Recommended  Decision  is  an  interim  step,  meant  to 
create  a  pause  in  fund  growth  while  a  more  equitable  and  comprehensive  distribu-
tion mechanism can be crafted. The current support mechanisms must be reformed 
to reduce excessive support to multiple providers and better target financial support 
as envisioned by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Funding redundant providers 
is  particularly  troubling  for  consumers  in  net-contributor  states,  who  shoulder  the 
burden of undue growth in the high-cost fund. Therefore, I share my colleagues ur-
gency in addressing a comprehensive reform of the high-cost distribution mechanism 
that adheres to the goals of Universal Service. 

STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER LARRY S. LANDIS 

In  the  Matter  of  High-Cost  Universal  Service  Support,  WC  Docket  No.  05–337; 

Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, CC Docket No. 96–45 

In recent weeks, the bulk of the attention by various parties offering ex parte com-
ments in this proceeding has been devoted to certain anticipated aspects of the pro-
posed interim emergency cap which is addressed in today’s Recommended Decision. 
I can appreciate the concern of various parties with regard to how (without knowing 
the  exact  parameters  of  the  proposed  cap)  it  might  impact  them.  Much  has  been 
said  and  written  about  the  need  for  competitively  and  technologically  neutral  poli-
cies, disregarding the fact that in some respects the current regime is anything but. 
The  basic  facts  are  inescapable,  as  set  forth  in  the  Recommended  Decision. 
Growth  in  high-cost  support  on  the  current  trend  line  is  unsustainable.  A  number 
of proposals were offered in ex parte filings as alternatives, with the intent of ‘‘shar-
ing the pain’’ among various groups of providers. Those proposals fail to address the 
fact  that  for  most  segments,  growth  has  been  virtually  flat  or  even  modestly  nega-
tive in the short run; there is only one group of providers which have seen dramatic 
and continued growth, and that group is wireless CETCs. 

To  use  an  analogy,  if  you  are  offering  emergency  medical  treatment  to  a  badly 
injured person who is bleeding profusely from the arm, you don’t address the short- 
term problem by applying a tourniquet to the patient’s leg. Having said that, a tour-
niquet  is  not  a  long-term  or  permanent  solution,  and  neither  is  the  interim  emer-
gency cap. 

While  the  growth  is  attributable  to  CETCs,  most  of  which  are  wireless  carriers, 
they are simply operating under the current laws and rules, once they have received 
ETC  designation.  Over  the  course  of  the  past  several  months,  I  have  come  to  a 
greater appreciation of the extent to which there are wireless companies which oper-
ate  on  a  business  model  targeted  primarily  to  serving  rural  areas,  and  which  con-
tribute  significantly  to  realizing  the  goal  of  providing  truly  Universal  Service  to 
areas where costs are such that no business case can be made for build-out, absent 
Universal Service support. 

At  the  same  time,  there  are  many  rural  areas  where  multiple  wireless  providers 
are active. Where there is already competition, we need to make sure we don’t inad-
vertently advantage one company over the others which entered that market based 
on a competitive, unsubsidized model. Indeed, it may be time to ask if the presence 
of  some  minimum  number  of  competitors  greater  than  one  in  a  market  is  a  prima 
facie  indicator  that  the  market  is  contestable  and  competitive,  and  that  no  Uni-
versal  Service  support  should  be  rendered  to  the  competing  providers  in  that  mar-
ket. 

The  states  have  an  obligation  and  a  growing  partner  role  with  the  FCC  as  joint 
stewards  in  seeing  to  it  that  Universal  Service  funds  are  appropriately  deployed, 
that legitimate needs are met, but that accountability and performance are audited 
and demanded. 

Now  that  the  interim  Recommended  Decision  has  been  approved  by  this  body,  it 
is my hope that we can move on to the far more significant and far-reaching issues 
and potential solutions addressed in the companion Request for Comment. 

The Request for Comment raises the question of whether the Joint Board and the 
Commission  should  consider  adding  broadband  to  the  list  of  supported  services.  It 
is  my  hope  that  the  parties  will  examine  not  only  the  threshold  questions  (is  pene-

tration  sufficient  for  broadband  to  qualify  as  a  supported  service?)  but  also,  if  they 
conclude that broadband should be a supported service, how that can best and most 
efficiently  be  implemented.  What  are  the  appropriate  threshold  funding  obligations 
of  providers?  Of  the  several  states,  including  (but  not  limited  to)  state  funds  and 
other  incentives?  And  of  the  high-cost  funds?  These  potential  interrelationships  re-
quire closer examination. 

Finally,  I  appreciate  the  concerns  of  those  who  have  suggested  that  the  interim 
emergency  cap  will  somehow  morph  into  an  intermediate  or  long-term  default 
‘‘patch’’ to the issues we propose to examine. By explicitly committing to making fur-
ther  recommendations  regarding  long  term,  comprehensive  high-cost  Universal 
Service  reform  within  6  months,  and  by  proposing  that  the  cap  expire  1  year  from 
the  date  when  such  recommendations  are  offered,  I  hope  that  we  have  convinced 
interested  parties  that  the  Joint  Board  is  determined  to  address  those  long  term 
issues in a meaningful, thoughtful and aggressive manner. 

If we are to do so, we will need to build a record which is considerably more com-
prehensive  and  provides  greater  granularity  than  that  which  we  have  today.  Inter-
ested parties simply need to move with dispatch. The clock is running for all parties 
with an interest in the outcome of this deliberation. As such, the record will be only 
as robust as the parties make it. 

STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER JOHN BURKE 

In  the  Matter  of  High-Cost  Universal  Service  Support,  WC  Docket  No.  05–337; 

Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, CC Docket No. 96–45 

I  agree  with  my  colleagues  on  the  USF  Joint  Board  as  to  today’s  Recommended 
Decision. I would stress the need for a comprehensive solution to be finally adopted 
by the FCC at the earliest possible date. 

Some  inequities  could  result  from  any  cap  but  inequities  undoubtedly  already 
exist  at  least  in  part  because  of  the  identical  support  rule  as  presently  applied.  I 
would  hope  then  that  the  cap  never  be  extended  beyond  the  18  month  period  con-
templated as the outside margin of this recommendation for development and adop-
tion of these more comprehensive reforms 

CONCURRING STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER RAY BAUM 

In  the  Matter  of  High-Cost  Universal  Service  Support,  WC  Docket  No.  05–337; 

Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, CC Docket No. 96–45 

In concurring with today’s interim decision capping the CETC portion of the fund, 

I would like to emphasize the following: 

1. I underscore that today’s decision is interim. The Joint Board intends to rec-
ommend  major  reform  of  the  USF  to  the  FCC  within  6  months  of  the  date  of 
this  decision.  Parties  should  file  their  comments  in  response  to  the  accom-
panying Public Notice within the comment periods. Parties who wait to put for-
ward their proposals in ex parte submissions will jeopardize their consideration. 
The Joint Board intends to move expeditiously, and takes seriously the 6 month 
deadline for recommending major reform. 
2.  My  support  for  a  cap  of  this  nature  is  limited  to  the  18  months  outlined  in 
today’s  decision.  In  several  states,  there  are  high-cost  rural  service  areas  that 
had  no  CETC  drawing  USF  support  during  the  interim  cap’s  2006  base  period. 
As  a  result  of  the  cap,  consumers  in  these  rural  areas  may  not  enjoy  the  same 
quality  and  reliability  of  service  that  is  enjoyed  by  rural  consumers  in  states 
with  earlier  CETC  designations.  The  CETC  portion  of  the  Fund  is  now  dis-
proportionately  allocated  among  rural  consumers  and  states.  This  cap  does  not 
remedy that inequity. 
3.  Broadband  is  critical  to  telecommunications/information  services  of  the  fu-
ture,  for  both  rural  and  urban  Americans.  Rural  ILECs  have  generally  done  a 
good job of making broadband available to the rural consumers they serve; non- 
rural  ILECs  generally  have  not.  The  Joint  Board  and  commenting  parties 
should  address  whether  this  inequity  can  be  remedied  by  properly  focused  in-
centives  to  ETCs,  both  wireline  and  wireless,  to  provide  necessary  broadband 
services to all rural consumers. 
4.  Due  to  unsustainable  growth  pressures  on  the  Fund  all  ETCs  should  antici-
pate  changes  to  current  USF  distribution  mechanisms.  The  identical  support 
rule  for  CETCs  may  not  survive.  Rural  ILECs  may  no  longer  receive  support 
based on their embedded costs. All parties should use the forthcoming comment 
periods to put forth their best ideas, describing in detail how they are to be im-
plemented.

The  Joint  Board  faces  difficult  decisions  in  the  next  6  months.  The  best  efforts 
of  all  parties  in  filing  comments  to  assist  the  Joint  Board  is  essential  and  appre-
ciated. 

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER MICHAEL J. COPPS 

In  the  Matter  of  High-Cost  Universal  Service  Support,  WC  Docket  No.  05–337; 

Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, CC Docket No. 96–45 

Congress  made  clear  what  it  expected  of  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Uni-
versal  Service  in  section  254  of  the  Communications  Act:  the  Board  shall  rec-
ommend  policies  to  preserve  and  advance  Universal  Service.  Since  I  rejoined  the 
Joint  Board  over  2  years  ago,  my  colleagues  and  I  have  worked  with  this  singular 
purpose in mind. As anyone who toils in the field of Universal Service knows, there 
are  many  worthy  ideas  on  how  to  achieve  the  purposes  set  forth  in  the  Act.  Today 
the  Joint  Board  recommends  that  the  FCC  impose  a  so-called  ‘‘interim,  emergency 
cap’’  on  the  high-cost  support  available  to  competitive  eligible  telecommunications 
carriers.  While  I  commend  my  colleagues  for  their  good  intentions—to  curb  the 
growth of the Universal Service Fund—I have serious concerns that such a cap will 
be misinterpreted as a solution, even though it does not address—or pretend to ad-
dress—the  fundamental,  comprehensive  reforms  needed  to  carry  a  viable  and  im-
proved system of Universal Service forward in the twenty-first century. 

The  clear  and  compelling  challenge  to  the  Joint  Board  and  the  FCC  is  to  bring 
basic  and  advanced  telecommunications  to  all  our  citizens  and  to  ensure  that  our 
Universal Service system, which has accomplished so much, can continue to sustain 
itself.  Our  job  is  to  develop  strategies  and  programs  to  bring  the  best,  most  acces-
sible  and  cost-effective  communications  system  in  the  world  to  all  our  people—and 
Universal  Service  does  indeed  mean  ‘‘all’’  our  people.  Every  citizen  of  this  great 
country  should  have  access  to  the  wonders  of  communications—whether  they  live 
on  farms  or  rural  hamlets,  on  tribal  lands  or  in  the  inner  city;  whether  they  have 
limited income or are challenged by disabilities; whether they are schoolchildren or 
rural healthcare providers. 

Universal service has done great things for America. But its job is far—very far— 
from  complete.  Revolutionary  changes  are  transforming  the  world  of  telecommuni-
cations,  but  not  all  of  us  will  be  able  to  benefit  from  them  without  significant  Uni-
versal Service system reforms. We have studied these problems for a very long time. 
Hundreds  of  discussions  have  taken  place.  Ideas  have  been  exchanged.  Solutions 
have  been  proposed.  The  problem  is  that  the  solutions  are  not  painless.  Companies 
and  government  both  get  comfortable  with  business  as  usual,  and  when  someone 
proposes  to  rock  the  boat  we  all  get  nervous.  Game  theory  supersedes  decision-
making—and nothing gets done. Yet reality keeps knocking at the door: the system 
is stressed; down the present path it may not be sustainable; it still marches to the 
tune  of  20th  century  telecom.  And  there  is  this:  we  may  all  be  called  on  for  shared 
sacrifice if Universal Service is going to fulfill its mission. 

I believe we have it within our ability—and within our grasp—to resolve our cur-
rent  Universal  Service  Fund  problems  and  to  deploy  a  system  that  can  contribute 
mightily to economic opportunity for all our citizens and to truly expansive economic 
growth  for  our  country.  This  modernized  Universal  Service  system  would  ensure 
that every citizen in our country is connected to vital education, public health, pub-
lic safety, employment and entrepreneurial opportunities. 

But  we  don’t  have  the  luxury  of  time  to  get  this  right.  That  is  why  I  believe  to-
day’s recommendation misses the mark—it puts too many issues off to another day. 
It’s risky business. 

The  Joint  Board  has  two  major  referrals  before  it,  one  dating  to  2002  and  the 
other to 2004. These are complicated referrals, to be sure, but it is nevertheless en-
tirely  possible  to  come  forward  with  recommendations  on  the  outstanding  issues 
with which we are all familiar. Instead the Joint Board proposes an interim, emer-
gency  cap  that  solves  no  enduring  problem  and  that  will  be  interpreted  by  many 
as movement enough to justify putting the larger Universal Service reform impera-
tive  on  the  back-burner.  I  fear  today’s  action  diminishes  rather  than  enhances  the 
prospects for near or even mid-term reform. 

In  the  best-case  scenario  under  the  proposed  cap,  even  if  the  Joint  Board  acts 
within 6 months on fundamental reforms and the FCC then proceeds to adopt some 
version  of  those  reforms  in  a  year,  it  will  be  18  months—autumn  of  2008—before 
we even have a strategic long-term plan from the FCC for Universal Service reform. 
If  the  past  is  prologue,  coming  to  FCC  consensus  may  take  far  longer  than  that, 
not to mention any legislative changes that may be suggested. 

Frankly,  I  worry  that  an  emergency,  interim  cap  inflames  discord  and  disagree-
ment among industry sectors at a time when we should be bringing everyone to the

table  to  develop  as  much  consensus  as  we  can.  I  don’t  see  the  need  to  poison  the 
well when we could all be drinking from the same cup. Others have expressed con-
cerns  that  this  emergency  action  could  lead  to  extended  litigation  and  to  putting 
into play concerns about the lack of technology neutrality that some see in this pro-
posal. 

It  is  not  just  the  pressure  on  the  Universal  Service  Fund  that  compels  action.  It 
is even more the pressure from our country’s grossly inadequate under-performance 
in  getting  advanced  telecommunications  out  to  all  our  citizens.  Just  last  week,  the 
OECD moved the United States down three more spots in its broadband rankings— 
now  your  country  and  mine  is  Number  15.  Some  are  attempting  to  impugn  the 
rankings or to say that, even if true, it is good news that other countries are moving 
forward  so  quickly!  These  comments  and  claims  are  lame  attempts  to  mask  a  na-
tional  embarrassment.  Universal  service  has  a  huge  role  to  play  in  correcting  our 
course and moving us back toward the top where the United States always belongs. 
This  is  why  it  is  so  incumbent  upon  us  to  get  comprehensive  Joint  Board  rec-
ommendations to the Commission expeditiously and then for the Commission to act. 
We  need  to  act  not  just  because  informed  action  will  move  us  up  the  rankings,  but 
because of what our country’s poor performance means in terms of a continuing, per-
haps even worsening, rural-urban digital gap and in terms of economic opportunities 
foregone for individuals, communities and businesses all across America. 

The  Joint  Board  is  filled  with  uncommon  knowledge,  expertise  and  good  judg-
ment.  It  has  most  of  the  information,  data,  and  analysis  that  it  needs,  right  now, 
to  move  ahead  to  propose  needed  repairs  and  modernization  for  Universal  Service. 
I  will  be  in  the  minority  with  my  vote  today.  Still,  I  look  forward  to  working  with 
my colleagues and friends on the Joint Board and the Commission to move the ball 
forward on the new field we have designed. To them and to all the millions of stake-
holders  in  this  work,  I  pledge  my  full  participation  and  cooperation  to  move  ahead 
as speedily as possible to expedite and complete the Joint Board’s work.

the high-cost fund under control. See e.g., Letter from Mary L. Henze, Senior Direc-
tor Federal Regulatory, AT&T, to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC (dated March 22, 
2007); Kathleen Grillo, Vice President Federal Regulatory, Verizon, to Deborah Tay-

Chairman  Martin  at  the  February  2007  En  Banc  Hearing  of  the  Joint  Board,  dem-
onstrating growth of competitive ETC support and its consequences). 

27 For example, four states and Puerto Rico receive forty percent of the total sup-
port distributed to competitive ETCs, and ten states receive almost sixty percent of 
competitive ETC support. As shown in the attached table, many states receive little 
or no competitive ETC support. See Appendix B. 

28 See 47 C.F.R. §§ 36.603 and 54.801(a). 
29 Local  switching  support  for  incumbent  LECs  ranged  between  $360  million  and 
$384 million annually from 2003 through 2006. Interstate common line support (in-
cluding  its  predecessor  long-term  support)  for  incumbent  LECs,  which  ranged  be-
tween  $871  million  and  $953  million  annually  from  2003  through  2006,  has  re-
mained stable at approximately $950 million annually for the last 2 years. See Uni-
versal Service Monitoring Report, Table 3.2.

ice,  and  Ray  Baum,  State  Chair,  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service 
(dated Apr. 13, 2007). 

33 See 47 U.S.C. § 254(a)(2). 
34 In addition to capping competitive ETC support by state, we considered, but de-
clined to recommend, capping competitive ETC support nationwide or by study area. 
A  nationwide  cap  amount  would  maintain  incentives  for  states  to  designate  addi-
tional  competitive  ETCs  to  increase  their  share  of  competitive  ETC  capped  support 
and  would  result  in  competitive  ETC  support  shifting  to  those  states  that  aggres-
sively  designate  competitive  ETCs  during  the  period  of  the  interim  cap.  A  cap  by 
study  area  would  foreclose  the  possibility  of  support  for  the  duration  of  the  cap  for 
those  study  areas  that  currently  have  no  competitive  ETCs  and  would  be  adminis-
tratively  burdensome.  We  note  that  establishing  the  cap  by  any  particular  geo-
graphic  area  would  not  change  the  total  amount  of  competitive  ETC  support  avail-
able for all competitive ETCs in the nation, but the scope of the geographic territory 
for  the  cap  affects  the  distribution  of  capped  support  and  the  administrative  com-
plexity of computing capped support.

I’m  pleased  to  be  here  today  to  address  the  Joint  Board’s  rec-
ommendation  regarding  high-cost  universal  support  and  to  con-
sider, more generally, ways to reform Universal Service. 

I don’t think that anyone questions the important policy goals in-
herent  in  the  Universal  Service  system.  And  nobody  in  1934,  or 
even  1996,  could  have  predicted  the  importance  of  wireless  service 
in modern life. 

I’ve  talked,  in  previous  hearings,  about  the  importance  of  high- 
speed  Internet  connections  in  rural  America,  the  importance  of 
having  telephone  service  and  cell  phone  service  all  over  our  state. 
I  can  tell  you  having  just  recently  driven  in  the  far  corners  of  our 
state, that it’s still a major issue. 

And,  in  light  of  this,  I’m  concerned  that  any  cap  on  high-cost 
Universal  Service  support  for  competitive  eligible  telecommuni-
cations  carriers,  even  the  temporary  cap  proposed  by  the  Joint 
Board, may at first delay and then hamper current efforts to build- 
out  wireless  service  in  rural  America.  At  the  same  time,  I’ll  say 
that I recognize that the Universal Service system screams out for 
reform.  As  Commissioner  Copps  wrote  in  his  dissent  to  the  May  1 
Joint  Board  recommendation,  we  should  be  bringing  everyone  to 
the table to develop as much consensus as we can. 

I look forward to the testimony today, and questioning you, Com-
missioner Tate, and to learning about the ways we can achieve fun-
damental comprehensive reform. 

Thank you. 
Senator STEVENS. Thank you, Senator. 
Ms. Tate, these first questions are the Chairman’s questions. 
The  Joint  Board’s  recommendation  for  a  cap  is  designed  to  be  a 
short-term fix for the growth in Universal Service demand. In order 
to ensure the long-term stability of Universal Service, what specific 
further reforms would you favor? 

Ms.  TATE.  I’m  glad  the  Chairman  noted  that  this  was  definitely 
an  interim  decision,  and  a  consensus  decision,  on  what  action  to 
take. 

My  vision,  obviously,  in  terms  of  being  a  Commissioner,  I  have 
an  open  mind  on  many  of  the  proposals  that  have  been  submitted 
to  the  record.  We  have  numerous  comments,  and  reply  comments, 
and I’m looking forward to the close of that comment period, to re-
view all of those. 

My  vision,  as  I  said  in  my  statement,  was  for  us  to  move  to  a 
technologically and competitively neutral plan that would be based 
on  the  provider’s  cost,  and  hopefully  that  would  also  have  mecha-
nisms  that  would  control  this  continued  growth  over  time  so  that, 
indeed,  we  can  sustain  the  Fund  to  be  used  precisely  as  you  all 
have recognized, for what it should be. 

There are a number of proposals, obviously, that you all have dis-
cussed. Chairman Martin and many others in the record have sug-
gested  reverse  auctions  that,  indeed,  would  be  technologically  and 
competitively  neutral.  The  Joint  Board  suggested  in  our  Rec-
ommended  Decision,  that  the  FCC  review  the  primary  line  restric-
tion, which Congress has disallowed in the past; and the possibility 
of  revisiting  the  portability  rule.  There  are  also  some  proposals 
about  trying  to  utilize  more  granular  data  for  the  purpose  of  also 
better targeting the funds to the need.

Senator STEVENS. The Chairman would have asked, ‘‘In the long 
term,  do  you  believe  that  Universal  Service  funding  should  be 
available to more than one carrier in a geographic area?’’ 

Ms.  TATE.  We  did  not  reach  a  decision  about  that.  And  I  think 
that  is  one  of  those  decisions  that,  as  a  Commissioner,  I  will  be 
faced  with  in  trying  to  determine  what  fundamental  reform  will 
look  like.  Certainly,  that’s  going  to  be  an  important  part  of  this, 
and that is whether we fund multiple carriers in areas that are de-
termined to be high-cost areas. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  the  Joint  Board  recommends  Universal 
Service funds for competitive carriers be capped on a state-by-state 
basis.  The  recommendation  omits  any  mention  of  tribal  lands.  In 
the  light  of  the  special  jurisdictional  concerns  involving  Indian 
country, how should the FCC apply that cap to tribal lands? That’s 
still a question of the Chairman’s. 

Ms.  TATE.  Yes,  sir,  I  understand.  I  think  that,  as  I  said  in  my 
statement,  certainly  the  FCC  and  the  Joint  Board  realizes  there 
are many unique circumstances for tribal lands, and we would need 
to  take  those  unique  circumstances  into  account  as  we  move  for-
ward with the implementation of a cap. 

Senator  STEVENS.  In  order  to  preserve  sovereignty  of  these 
tribes,  would  it  be  best  to  address  support  for  competitive  carriers 
serving tribal lands on a case-by-case basis? 

Ms.  TATE.  Senator,  I  haven’t  had  an  opportunity  to  think  about 
looking  at  that.  I  assume  that  as  we  look  at  tribal  lands  through 
the  lens  of  the  unique  circumstances  that  they  pose,  I  assume 
that’s what that does mean. 

Senator  STEVENS.  All  right.  Senator  Sununu  preceded  me,  and  I 

would call on him first. 

Senator SUNUNU. No, that’s all right. Please continue. 
Senator  STEVENS.  All  right.  I  just  have  one  question.  Did  the 
Joint  Board  consider  the  problem  of  paying  the  second  carrier,  the 
competitive  carrier,  on  the  basis  of  the  primary  carrier’s  costs?  As 
I understand it, if carrier A has been serving, and carrier B comes 
in  to  compete  and  seeks  Universal  Service,  the  reimbursement  to 
carrier  B  is  based  upon  the  cost  to  carrier  A,  not  carrier  B.  And, 
by  definition,  in  almost  every  circumstance,  carrier  B  has  a  sub-
stantially lower cost. Why the windfall? 

Ms.  TATE.  Yes,  sir.  Well,  I  think  that  that  goes  back  to  funda-

mental reform of the entire program. 

Senator  STEVENS.  It’s  not  in  the  law.  The  Commission  did  that. 
Ms.  TATE.  Once  again,  I  think  that  that  is  precisely  the  reason 
that we need to move forward absolutely as quickly as possible to-
ward fundamental reform. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  I  agree.  I  just  cannot  believe  that  we 
would  have  the  situation  continue,  when  the  Commission  has  the 
authority  to  change  this  without  the  Joint  Board.  We  do  have  the 
bill Senators Dorgan and Smith have introduced, and I have a bill 
on Universal Service reforms, and Senator Inouye’s staff and mine 
are working on a way to put them all together. 

But  it’s  going  to  take  time  to  do  that.  The  Commission  could 
solve  this  now.  That  chart  you  showed  us  of  the  increased  cost  is 
based upon a cost basis that is based primarily upon fixed cost. The 
new carriers are involved in wireless and other basic costs that are

substantially  lower.  I  just  don’t  understand  why  the  Commission 
persists  in  allowing  that  to  continue.  Have  you  reviewed  it  at  all? 
Ms.  TATE.  That  was  not  what  the  Joint  Board  particularly  fo-
cused on. The Joint Board came to a consensus that we should cap 
the  CETC  side  on  the  Fund  only  as  an  interim  basis  so  we  could 
move  forward  as  quickly  as  possible  toward  fundamental  reform.  I 
agree  with  you,  Senator,  that  the  present  system  is  fraught  with 
many inequities. 

Senator  STEVENS.  This  will  be  my  last  question.  It  is  my  under-
standing,  what  is  happening  now,  under  the  Joint  Board’s  rec-
ommendation,  is  you  cap  the  newcomers,  you  cap  the  competitors 
that  are  coming  in,  and  keep  that  cap  on  for  at  least  18  months, 
when  the  problem  is  recognizing  those  newcomers  come  in  at  a 
lower  cost.  I’m  frustrated  dealing  with  this  issue,  because  we’re 
getting  a  bill  passed  when  FCC  has  the  power  to  deal  with  it. 
You’re  relying  on  this  Joint  Board  as  though  it’s  something  we 
mandated  you  to  follow.  We  have  not  mandated  that  you  follow 
them. Do you agree? 

Ms.  TATE.  I  can  understand  your  frustration,  Senator.  And  I 
think we’re all frustrated. I think that’s why the Joint Board came 
to a consensus decision that we needed to do something to curb the 
Fund. 

I do want to speak for a moment, though, about the new carriers 
that could be designated. The cap is at the State level, so new car-
riers  may  be  designated,  and  they  would  share  in—underneath 
whatever that State cap is. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Yes,  I’m  afraid  of  that.  With  a  state  one-fifth 
the  size  of  the  United  States,  we  have  the  new  carriers  come  in 
with new technology, and you’re going to put a cap on what’s hap-
pened  in  the  past,  when  we  still  have  areas  that  don’t  have  any 
service  at  all.  So,  I  don’t  understand  what’s  going  on.  It’s  just  like 
someone’s  putting  their  head  in  the  ground.  This  is  an  ostrich  ap-
proach, as far as I’m concerned. 

Senator Sununu? 
Senator SUNUNU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Commissioner  Tate,  you  indicated  that  the  Commission—or  the 
Board  wasn’t  able  to  reach  consensus  on  more  comprehensive 
measures.  And  that’s  frustrating  to  hear,  especially  in  an  environ-
ment, and on a Committee, where everyone says they’re for reform, 
and  they’re  for  change,  and  they’re  for  the  future,  and  they’re  for 
the children. Can you be specific as to what the obstacles are, and 
what  the  reasons  are,  that  have  prevented  consensus  from  being 
developed at the Joint Board? 

Ms. TATE. Well, let me start out with saying that there was con-
sensus. Seven of eight of us determined that we needed to take this 
first step. So, in—— 

Senator SUNUNU. No, no, but consensus on—— 
Ms. TATE. I understand. 
Senator  SUNUNU.—broader  reform.  No,  but  you  wouldn’t  be 
here—you  wouldn’t  have  made  the  recommendation  on  the  CETCs 
if there weren’t consensus, I understand that. But—— 

Ms. TATE. And—— 
Senator  SUNUNU.  But  you  were  talking  about  more  competitive 

reform——

26 

Ms. TATE. Absolutely. 
Senator SUNUNU.—and an—— 
Ms. TATE. And—— 
Senator SUNUNU.—obstacle there. 
Ms. TATE. And I can assure you, I wish that I could have moved 
us,  faster,  forward  to  more  comprehensive  reform.  We  discussed 
many  of  the  recommendations  that  are  already  in  the  record.  I 
think the good news is, I’ve never seen this much attention focused 
on  these  issues.  People  are  frustrated.  The  Fund  is  growing  at  an 
unsustainable  rate.  So,  I  do  think  we  are  beginning  to  get  good, 
cost-effective,  cost-based—as  Senator  Stevens  said—proposals  on 
the  table,  and  we  will  move  forward.  We  are  meeting  in  July.  We 
continue  to  meet  extremely  often  to  try  to  move  forward  on  this. 
The  reply  comment  period,  I  think,  closed  today  or  tomorrow.  We 
will  immediately  get  all  of  those  comments  summarized  and  begin 
to work through each one of those concepts. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  But,  in  the  absence  of  any  description  of  what 
the  specific  obstacles  to  consensus  for  broader  reform,  it’s  hard  to 
believe, then, that you’ll be able to meet the goal of putting forward 
a  more  comprehensive  plan  in  6  months.  And,  in  your  statement, 
you  talk  about  being  able  to  advance  some  more  comprehensive 
proposals  in  the  near  future.  One,  why  should  we  feel  good  about 
that  commitment—or  why  should  we  feel  comfortable  that  that 
goal  will  be  met?  And,  two,  what  deadline  should  Congress  set  to 
help ensure that that action is forthcoming? 

Ms.  TATE.  Well,  thank  you  for  recognizing  it’s  a  really  tough  job 
trying  to  get  people  to  come  to  consensus,  especially  on  these 
issues. So, I thank you for recognizing that. It would be wonderful 
if you all asked the next panel some of these questions. 

Senator STEVENS. We will. 
[Laughter.] 
Ms.  TATE.  Ask  them  to  come  together  so  that  we  can  get  to  fun-

damental reform. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  But  why  are  you  confident  it  will  happen  in  6 

months? And should Congress set a deadline for action? 

Ms.  TATE.  The  Joint  Board,  in  a  consensus  decision,  chose  6 
months.  We  wanted  to  keep  ourselves  on  a  very  tight  timeframe. 
If  you  all  would  like  to  choose  a  timeframe,  I’m  sure  that  we  will 
try to accommodate that. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  In  the  meantime,  we  have  an  interim  cap  on 
CETCs. Some of them have requests pending, or decisions pending, 
at  the  FCC.  What  happens  to  them?  And  I’m  sure  there  are  some 
in many states; I’m quite sure there are some in New Hampshire— 
and  they’ve  had  requests  and  decisions  pending  in  front  of  the 
FCC,  not  for  a  couple  of  months,  but,  in  some  cases,  for  a  few 
years.  What  happens  to  those  pending  requests?  And  are  they 
going  to  be  just  shut  off  from  the  access  that  would  have  been 
available if this decision either hadn’t been made so soon or if their 
petitions had been acted on in a more timely way? 

Ms. TATE. The state cap would provide that the amount of fund-
ing  is  capped  at  the  2006  level,  which  is  a  real  amount,  that  we 
knew  would  be  a  firm  amount.  If  new  ETC  designations  are 
made—and, as you know, most of those are through Section 214 at

27 

the State level—they will take a pro rata share of the state-capped 
amount. 

Senator SUNUNU. So, they’re out of luck. You know, if they made 
a  request  2  years  ago,  or  3  years  ago,  the  FCC  hasn’t  acted,  you 
impose this cap, so it’s too late, because their petition wasn’t acted 
on in a timely way. 
Ms. TATE. No—— 
Senator SUNUNU. They can take from some other CETC, because 
they’re taking out of a capped pool at the State level. I understand 
the  point  you  made  with  regard  to  the  pro  rata  share.  But,  you 
know—— 

Ms. TATE. That’s—— 
Senator  SUNUNU.—there’s  obviously  a  very  different  economic 
picture and a very different economic value in that. So, they’re out 
of luck. 

Ms. TATE. They will receive funding. It will just be capped at the 

State level of 2006. 

Senator SUNUNU. But the incumbents won’t be capped. 
Ms. TATE. Yes. 
Senator SUNUNU. But there’s no cap on any other part of the pro-

gram. 

Ms.  TATE.  Oh,  the  incumbent  providers.  Actually—well,  Senator 
Sununu, you know, there are caps over on the wireline side, on the 
high-loop  cost  and  on  the  interstate  access  rate.  And  then  you 
know  that  we  also  have  a  cap  on  both  the  E-Rate  fund  and  the 
rural healthcare fund. So, I mean, there are some caps in place. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  Right,  but  there’s  no  overall  cap  in  the  high- 

cost support, which is what benefits most of the—— 

Ms. TATE. There isn’t a cap—— 
Senator SUNUNU.—most of the ILECs. 
Ms. TATE.—that—there is not a cap now on the overall fund. 
Senator SUNUNU. Understood. Thank you. 
Senator STEVENS. Senator Snowe, did you have an opening state-

ment? 

Senator SNOWE. I did, Mr. Chairman, but I could do it later. 
Senator STEVENS. You may do it later, yes. 
Senator SNOWE. Thank you. 
Senator STEVENS. Senator Pryor? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  would  like  to  ask  about  the  Joint  Board’s  recommendation 
being  interim  in  nature.  Do  you  think  ‘‘interim’’  means  interim?  I 
mean, is that a short-term, long-term—how—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator PRYOR. What does that mean, in your world? 
Ms.  TATE.  Obviously,  I  haven’t  been  in  D.C.  as  long  as  all  the 

people behind me, but—— 

[Laughter.] 
Ms. TATE. You know, we chose—again, as a consensus decision— 
to  make  this  an  interim  cap.  We  set  very  strict  guidelines  to  act 
in  the  most  timely  way  that  we,  as  the  Joint  Board,  felt  would  be 
possible.  In  the  decision,  we  even  used  the  word  ‘‘emergency.’’  So, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:14 May 07, 2012 Jkt 074012 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74012.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

28 

I  am  hoping—I  pledge  to  you  all  that  I  will  work  as  hard  as  I  can 
to  facilitate  the  continued  discussions  between  the  Joint  Board 
members so it is, indeed, an interim cap. 

Senator PRYOR. The concern I have about the use of the term ‘‘in-
terim’’ is that the Commission adopted an interim freeze on separa-
tions factors in 1982, and an interim cap on high-cost loop support 
in  1993,  and,  basically,  those  are  still  in  effect  today.  So,  I  think 
there  have  been  very  slight  modifications  to  both  of  those,  and 
there are probably other examples, too, that people in the audience 
are  aware  of.  When  you  talk  about  ‘‘interim,’’  and  you  talk  about 
‘‘consensus’’—now,  I  wasn’t  part  of  any  of  those  discussions,  but  I 
would  like  to  know  your  impressions  on  the  consensus.  It  sounds 
to me like it was very, very difficult to reach a consensus, and, ba-
sically,  you  just  did  the  best  you  could  under  the  circumstances. 
But  maybe  a  true  consensus  still  needs  to  be  reached.  Is  that  fair 
to say? 

Ms.  TATE.  Absolutely,  Senator.  We  must  move  toward  funda-

mental reform. 

Senator PRYOR. Well, what—— 
Ms. TATE. And—— 
Senator PRYOR.—what is it that will get you to consensus, where 
we  can  move  to  fundamental  reform?  What  are  the  major  sticking 
points? 

Ms.  TATE.  Someone  has  already  quoted  my  colleague  Commis-
sioner  Copps,  and  he  said,  ‘‘Well,  everyone  may  have  to  sacrifice  a 
little.’’ And, again, not to be trite, but you are going to have a panel 
in  front  of  you  that  represents  all  the  major  industries  that  are 
going to be affected by whatever—whether it’s a cap or another rec-
ommendation—that  the  FCC  may  accept.  So,  I  would  ask  you  all, 
as we are doing, to encourage the industry to come together around 
some consensus proposal. 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK.  There’s  a  lot  of  investment  right  now  in 
rural  broadband  by  the  wireless  industry.  Do  you  think  that  this 
recommendation of the Joint Board will help or hurt deployment of 
rural broadband? 

Ms.  TATE.  You  know,  obviously,  like  you,  I  live  right  next  door, 
and  I  am  constantly  amazed  and  thrilled  by  all  the  services  that 
the wireless industry is providing. We want to do all we can to en-
courage that. I believe that rural Americans should have an evolv-
ing  level  of  services.  So,  I  hope  the  interim  nature  of  this  will  be 
seen  as  that,  and  that  companies  will  continue  to  invest.  And,  as 
you  know,  there  are  many  companies  that  don’t  seek  ETC  sta-
tus—— 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Ms. TATE.—wireless companies, that do provide services. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Right.  There  again,  the  ‘‘interim’’  issue  there,  to 
me,  would  make  it  difficult  for  a  company  to  know  what  to  do,  in 
terms of how much to invest, based on what the future might look 
like. They would like some certainty. 

Ms. TATE. Senator, what do you think—I mean, I’m—I’m very in-
terested in moving toward a more competitively neutral cost-based 
system,  so  that’s  one  of  the  concepts,  for  instance,  when  you  say, 
‘‘What’s  standing  in  your  way?’’—you  know,  perhaps  that’s  some-

thing  that  the  wireless  industry  would  want  to  come  forward 
with—— 

Senator PRYOR. Uh-huh. 
Ms. TATE.—some kind of cost-based analysis, their own cost, cost 
to serve a very specific area. Alltel has a really creative suggestion 
in  the  record  right  now  about  providing  broadband  to  underserved 
areas.  So,  you  know,  maybe  those  are  some  suggestions  that  you 
could encourage. 

Senator PRYOR. OK. Well, thank you, and I’ll try to do that. 
One  last  question,  on  the  Fifth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals.  They 
stated  that  the  Commission,  ‘‘Must  see  to  it  that  both  Universal 
Service  and  local  competition  are  realized,’’  and  that  you,  ‘‘cannot 
flatly ignore or contravene a goal set forth in the Act.’’ Do you feel 
like  this  recommendation  of  the  Joint  Board—are  you  accom-
plishing what the Fifth Circuit has laid out, or do you think there’s 
still work to be done? 

Ms.  TATE.  Well,  once  again,  yes,  there  is  much  work  to  be  done. 
We have got to move toward fundamental reform. And I think that 
this  cap  was  just  in  order  to  move  us  forward  one  step  to  stem 
what we see as just unsustainable growth on that side. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator STEVENS. Thank you. 
Senator McCaskill? 

STATEMENT OF HON. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI 
Senator MCCASKILL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  got  to  tell  you  that  I  know  broad-based  reform  is  hard,  but  if 
there  was  ever  an  area  that  needs  broad-based  reform,  obviously 
it’s  this.  And  I’m  a  little  depressed,  because  you  keep  asking  us  to 
ask  the  next  panel.  And  that’s  kind  of  a  public  acknowledgment 
that, you know, the cart is driving the horse here. 

The next panel is full of people who have financial interests. This 
is about money, and they have financial interests. And what you’re 
basically saying to us is, ‘‘The FCC is incapable of moving forward 
on  reform  unless  all  the  people  who  are  making  money  say  it’s 
OK.’’ And that’s hard for me to get my arms around. 

It  seems  to  me  that  the  FCC  is  supposed  to  be  the  body  that  is 
given  the  statutory  authority,  and  it’s  given  the  ability  to  look  at 
this  broad  program  and  see  whether  or  not  it’s  accomplishing  its 
purpose,  and  see  whether  people  are  being  enriched,  and  act,  not 
waiting for the people who are making money to all join hands and 
sing ‘‘Kumbaya.’’ 

And  so,  I’m  interested  in  why  we  have  gotten  to  the  point  that, 
before the FCC can do its job, you’ve got to get all the people mak-
ing money to agree with you. 

Ms.  TATE.  I  certainly  understand  your  frustration,  and  we  are 
acting.  I’m  here  today  because  we  took  a  step,  and  there  are  a  lot 
of  people  who  obviously  are  not  pleased  with  the  consensus  rec-
ommendation that the Joint Board came forward with. But we are 
moving  ahead.  We’ve  set  a  tight  timetable,  the  Joint  Board  has 
asked  the  FCC  to  work  on  a  very  tight  timetable.  I  think  the 
Chairman  will  be  placing  something  before  the  full  Commission  in 
very short order for us to look at. So, we are moving forward.

Senator  MCCASKILL.  It’s  my  understanding  that  the  cap  will  not 
cap the amount of money that taxpayers are paying into this Fund. 
Correct?  In  other  words,  the  amount  that  consumers  continue  to 
pay is going to remain. 

Ms.  TATE.  Well,  consumers  will  continue  to  pay  in,  but  the  rate 

will be capped at what the 2006 rate was. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  Well,  my  question  is  simple.  Will  the  Fund 

continue to grow, overall? 

Ms.  TATE.  Well,  we  have  only  capped  the  CETC  portion,  so  I 
can’t  answer,  right  now,  whether  the  Fund—the  entire  Fund  will 
continue  to  grow  or  not.  If  we  did  not  cap  this  side  of  the  Fund, 
then this side of the Fund would continue to have grown at a rate 
that’s unsustainable. 

Senator MCCASKILL. But there’s nothing in this recommendation 
that  will  make  sure  that  consumers  are  not  continuing  to  pay  for 
this in the future. 

Ms. TATE. Consumers are continuing to pay, today, Senator. 
Senator  MCCASKILL.  It’s  my  understanding  that  this  Fund  can-
not  be  used  for  broadband,  but  it  can,  kind  of—wink,  wink,  nod, 
nod—be  used  for  everything  but  DSLAM.  And  so,  is  it  the  knowl-
edge of the FCC that a lot of these monies are being used for what 
you  would  call  ancillary  or  connected  costs  of  deploying  broadband 
without actually spending it on the DSLAM? 

Ms.  TATE.  Well,  I  think  that  investment  in  infrastructure  that 
supports broadband—certainly, some of this money is being used to 
encourage  more  investment  in  infrastructure,  especially  in  rural 
areas. There—— 

Senator MCCASKILL. All right. 
Ms.  TATE.—are  also—as  you  know,  we  also  are  encouraging 
broadband  through  E-Rate,  through  our  rural  telemedicine,  so  we 
are encouraging broadband at the FCC. 

Senator MCCASKILL. I want to ask you, is the FCC familiar with 
what  is  and  isn’t  happening  with  the  Rural  Utilities  Service 
Broadband Grants at USDA? Do you all look at that, that program, 
and what is and isn’t happening with that program, as you all con-
sider  the  Universal  Service  Fund  and  the  impact  that  it  is  or  isn’t 
having in rural America? 

Ms. TATE. I don’t have any personal knowledge about having met 
with  them.  I’m  sure  that,  at  some  level,  our  bureaus  probably  do 
work together. I remember that when I was a Commissioner in the 
State of Tennessee, actually there was a joint RUS, ARC, and FCC 
pilot project up in Appalachia. So, I know that, at least in the past, 
our staffs have worked together. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  Well,  you  know,  it’s  another  example  of 
where,  there’s  money  being  spent  on  the  same  thing  from  two  dif-
ferent pots of money, and the person who knows how to access the 
pots  of  money,  and  who’s  got  the  inside  track,  they’re  all  anxious 
for  everything  that  is  currently  the  way  it  is  to  not  change.  And, 
as  has  kind  of  been  referenced  in  previous  questions,  the  goal 
needs to be that we continue to keep the field open for future com-
petitors,  and  I’m  frustrated  that  the  Rural  Utilities  Service 
Broadband Grants, even though we’d authorized with leverage, you 
know,  billions  of  dollars,  and  appropriated  billions  of  dollars,  it  is 
not  being  deployed  in  a  way  that  is  making  the  kind  of  progress,

I  think,  that  was  anticipated  by  the  legislation,  to  impact  rural 
broadband. 

Let me ask you this question. Do you all feel that the initial rea-
son this Fund was put in place, in terms of making sure that there 
were  landlines  available  in  rural  America—do  you  feel  that  the 
need is the same now, for maintenance as it was for establishment? 
Ms.  TATE.  Well,  certainly  I  believe  that  all  Americans  should 
have  the  opportunity  to  have  an  evolving  level  of  services.  And,  in 
order to have those new technologies, there has to be a new invest-
ment in infrastructure for companies to keep up with the new tech-
nologies and to provide those to all Americans. 

Senator MCCASKILL. Should we open up this fund for broadband, 

then, for Internet phone? 

Ms.  TATE.  Well,  that  is  certainly  one  of  the  recommendations 
that  we  have  been  asked,  on  numerous  times.  And,  in  fact,  I  be-
lieve  some  people  on  this  Committee  probably  would  like  for  us  to 
do  that.  The  Joint  Board  did  include  that  question  in  our  Public 
Notice that accompanied the Recommended Decision. So, we will be 
taking that into account as we move forward. 

Senator MCCASKILL. And is there any fear—if we’re frozen, with-
out  consensus,  by  the  people  who  are  stakeholders,  from  a  profit 
perspective  in  this  system,  is  there  any  fear  that  if  we  lock  in  a 
cap, that what we’re doing is locking in the status quo? 

Ms.  TATE.  I  hope  not.  This  is,  indeed,  a  change.  And  what  we 
hope  is  that—once  again,  this  is  the  first  step—we’re  in  a  process, 
this is not a solution—that this is the first step, so we can get, and 
move toward, fundamental reform. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  know  that  you’re 
working on broadbased reform in this area, and I hope that we can 
all come together and try to, as quickly as possible, within the way 
the  U.S.  Senate  works,  get  the  comprehensive  reform.  And  I  hope 
we include the Rural Utilities Service Broadband Grants. With the 
farm bill coming up, I think that has to be contemplated, too. 

It seems to me that we’ve got a bunch of silos here, and that the 
people  that  have  the  mechanism  to  move  around  those  silos  and 
figure out how to access the money are ones that are, kind of, driv-
ing  this  train,  as  opposed  to  the  sound  public  policy  that  ought  to 
be ruling the roost at this juncture. 

But,  I  thank  you,  Commissioner  Tate,  for  being  here  today,  and 
I  will  try  to,  along  with  my  colleagues,  ask  some  of  the  questions 
you  want  asked.  But  I  want  to  encourage  you,  that  it  doesn’t  mat-
ter what the next panel says, if the FCC is willing to act. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator STEVENS. Well, thank you, Senator. 
The  Senator—you’re  right,  because  that  is  a  pot  of  taxpayers’ 
money.  Our  normal  Universal  Service  is  dealing  with  ratepayers’ 
money.  And  we’ve  had  little  access,  through  this  Committee,  to 
that other pot of money. And the reform bill, we ought to find ways 
to  mandate  that  cooperation  so  that  the  subsidy  fund  is  used,  and 
used appropriately, to advance rural communications. And I thank 
you for the comments. 

Senator MCCASKILL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator STEVENS. Senator Klobuchar? 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

32 

To  follow  up  on  some  of  the  focus  of  Senator  McCaskill’s  com-
ments,  Commissioner  Tate,  I  mentioned  that  when  I  traveled 
through my State, I see, repeatedly, the need for more access to cell 
phones,  broadband.  And,  in  light  of  the  proposed  cap—I  know, 
again, you’ve talked about listening to these other panelists, but I’d 
like to know what you propose, to reform Universal Service. 

Ms.  TATE.  Well,  I  think  that  my  overall  vision  is  trying  to  move 
forward  to  technologically  and  competitively  neutral  mechanisms 
that are based on providers’ cost, not an embedded cost of someone 
else,  and  that  we  will  try  to  incent  efficient  technologies,  and  that 
we will try to incorporate some type of mechanism that will control 
the  Fund  growth  over  time  so  that,  once  again,  the  Fund  can  do 
what it was intended to do. 

I’m  in  a  little  bit  of  an  odd  position,  because  not  only  am  I  the 
head  of  the  Joint  Board,  I’ll  be  voting  on  many  of  these  rec-
ommendations  and  issues.  And  so,  I  have  an  open  mind.  I’m  look-
ing forward to even more concepts that may come forward on both 
the  distribution  side—like  reverse  auctions,  for  instance,  which 
would be competitively neutral—as well as over on the contribution 
side—for instance, the numbers-based approach that the Chairman 
and others have suggested. 

So, I think that we can do a better job using more granular data. 
I think, now there’s incredible technology, this GPS technology that 
we  haven’t  had  in  the  past,  so  that  we  can  target  it  to  places  that 
you’re describing and that are in my State, as well. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  You  know,  there  are  many  places  where 
multiple  carriers  receive  the  Universal  Service  Fund  support  for 
the  same  geographic  area,  and  that’s  especially  in  town  centers. 
And, at the same time, as you mentioned, there’s rural areas where 
there’s  no  support  at  all.  And  how  can  we  ensure—and,  again,  I 
want  to  follow  up  on  this,  the  end  of  your  comments  there—that 
the USF targets these underserved areas. 

Ms.  TATE.  Absolutely.  Well,  I  mean,  it  is  the  very  purpose  and 
essence of what Universal Service is, to target those areas. And so, 
that’s precisely what we are trying to do by getting to fundamental 
reform, so that, indeed, we can ensure—— 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  I’m  just  looking  for  your  ideas  on  how  we 
do  it,  because  I  just  haven’t  seen  it  happening  in  the  way  that  we 
want to see it happening. So—— 

Ms. TATE. Well, you know, I think that, once again, if we moved 
toward  something,  such  as  reverse  auctions,  then  we  are  ensuring 
that there is a carrier serving an area that is based on cost. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  You  know,  we  talked,  before,  about  getting 
things  under  control.  And,  I  know,  in  the  past  few  years,  both  the 
Commission  and  the  Joint  Board  have  sought  to  limit  the  number 
of competitive eligible carriers that were eligible for the USF funds. 
And  why  didn’t  this  reduce  the  dollar  amount  of  the  competitive 
carrier  support?  I  think  it  grew  from—correct  me  if  I’m  wrong— 
something like $15 million in 2001 to almost 1 billion in 2006. 

Ms.  TATE.  Yes,  those  numbers  are  right,  unfortunately.  And—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. And so—— 
Ms. TATE.—you know, this—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR.—what went wrong?

Ms.  TATE.  Well,  Section  214  of  the  Act  provides  that  the  states 
shall  designate  ETCs.  And  so,  while  the  Commission  has  tried  to 
encourage  more  stringent—for  instance,  criteria,  eligibility  cri-
teria—that  was  merely  voluntary—it  could  be  voluntarily  accepted 
by  the  States.  Some  States,  I  think,  have  slowed  down  on  their 
ETC  designations.  Some  states  have,  now,  more  stringent  require-
ments.  But  there  are  also  others  that  have  not  chosen  that  path. 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Did  the  Joint  Board  consider  other  interim 
measures besides a temporary cap on the amount of high-cost sup-
port that the competitive eligible carriers could receive? 

Ms. TATE. Well, of course we held an en banc. We had numerous 
comments  already  in  the  record.  We  reviewed  all  of  those.  But,  as 
I  said,  I  wasn’t  able  to  pull  the  Joint  Board  together  to  move  any 
farther toward consensus at this particular time. We all recognized 
we had to do something to stem the growth. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. And what do you think’s going to change in 
the next few months that will get you to get the kind of consensus 
you think you need to move? 

Ms. TATE. For one thing, because there are even more comments 
and ideas and innovative projects, such as the one that I mentioned 
that  Alltel  had  suggested.  I  think  that  there  continue  to  be  people 
coming  forward,  saying,  ‘‘What  about  this?  What  if  we  did  this?’’ 
And that’s precisely what we hoped would happen. So, we are con-
tinuing  to,  as  I  said,  review  all  that’s  in  the  record  now.  I  think 
the  record—the  reply  comments  may  close  tomorrow.  And,  of 
course, we’ll share all of that with you all, as well, and, you know, 
welcome your input. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. I’d just like to reiterate what you’re hearing 
from  the  other  Senators,  just  our  frustration  that  we  haven’t  been 
able to hear more from the FCC, in terms of reform, and get those 
ideas  moving  and  going.  We  hear  more  and  more  from  people 
throughout our states that we’re in this amazing technological age, 
but  some  of  them  are  still  left  standing  with  just  plain  old  tele-
phones,  and  they’re  not  able  to  access  this  technology  that  other 
people in this country are sharing in. 

Ms. TATE. I understand. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you. 
Senator STEVENS. Thank you very much. 
Maybe, Senator, we’ll—the Joint Board will have given Congress 

itself an incentive to act. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Very good idea, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator STEVENS. Senator Snowe? 

STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Senator SNOWE. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank you 
and  Chairman  Inouye  for  your  efforts  in  this  regard.  And  I  know 
your  efforts,  consistently,  as  previous  Chair  of  this  Committee,  in 
reform  legislation,  with  which  I’ve  joined  on  the  Universal  Service 
Fund, which is instrumental, undeniably. But, regrettably, we’re at 
a  point  today  where  I  think  that  it  handicaps  rural  America  with 
the  proposal  that  is  being  put  forward  by  both  the  Joint  State 
Board, Commissioner Tate, as well the FCC. I think it has ominous 
implications.

And you’ll, in the second panel, hear from one of my constituents, 
who  is  a  Chief  Deputy  of  the  Kennebec  Sheriff’s  Office  in  Maine, 
and  is  lead  spokesman  for  the  Maine  Sheriffs’  Association.  And 
he’ll  be  very  vocal,  as  he  has  in  raising,  I  think,  awareness  of  this 
issue  throughout  our  state,  about  the  implications  and  the  con-
sequences  of  the  inability  of  rural  America  to  have  access  to  wire-
less  service.  And  that’s  essentially  what  it’s  all  about  here  today. 
There’s  no  denying  we  need  reform.  And,  we  should  certainly  do 
our part here in Congress. But it doesn’t mean that we have to ac-
cept  a  recommendation  that  disadvantages  rural  America.  And 
that’s  certainly  true  in  Maine.  And  I  think  of  the  numbers,  it’s 
staggering,  from  where  we  are  today,  in  terms  of  wireless.  People 
having, more than 600,000—my 1.3 million population of the State 
of  Maine,  from  less  than  300,000—had  wireless,  back  in  2000– 
2001.  But,  as  a  result  of  this  cap  on  the  high-cost  fund,  what  is 
going  to  happen  is  that  they’re  going  to  be  fewer  towers  built.  In 
fact, we’ll lose five towers from one carrier. Another carrier is plan-
ning  to  build  32  towers  over  the  next  few  years,  and  six  of  which, 
last year that were built, were based on using funds from the high- 
cost  fund.  So,  what  that  means  is,  the  rural  parts  of  my  State,  as 
across  America,  as  indicated  by  the  comments  here  today  of—with 
my colleagues, are going to be denied the very technology that can 
make the difference between life and death. And that’s what Sher-
iff  Flannery  will  be  talking  about.  And  that’s  true.  It’s  one  thing 
to  say,  ‘‘Well,  I’m  sorry,  we  can’t  afford  this  service,’’  but,  at  the 
end  of  the  day,  the  consequences  are  that  people  in  rural  America 
aren’t  going  to  get  the  benefits,  of  this  service,  when  over  half  the 
calls to 9-1-1 come from wireless service. So, that’s what we’re talk-
ing  about.  These  are  life-threatening  situations;  in  addition,  obvi-
ously  the  economic  implications  when  rural  areas  are  denied  the 
state-of-the-art technology. 

And so, I think the inherent unfairness, the disproportionate bur-
den  that  it  places,  on  my  rural  State  of  Maine  and  rural  regions 
around  the  country,  I  think  should  lead  the  FCC  to  think  about 
putting  this  on  hold.  I  just  think  that,  frankly,  just  because  we 
haven’t  been  able  to  reach  a  comprehensive  solution,  whether  it’s 
in  Congress,  or  whether  it’s  within  the  FCC,  that  we  shouldn’t 
place  that  burden  on  rural  America  at  this  point  in  time.  The 
world’s  revolving  around  wireless.  And  if—that  being  the  case,  we 
can no longer say, ‘‘Well, we’re just going to continue to have them 
exist  on  1920s  technology,  with  wirelines,’’  because  we’re  in  a  dif-
ferent  world  today,  and  I  don’t  think  that  rural  areas  should  face 
that disproportionally. 

Finally,  the  point  I  want  to  make  is,  is  that  wireless  carriers— 
and  I’d  like  to  have  you  speak  to  this  question—pay  more  than  a 
third  of  the  contributions  to  the  high-cost  fund,  so,  therefore,  they 
should  reap  the  benefits,  of  being  able  to  build-out  this  infrastruc-
ture in rural regions of our country, as in two of our major carriers 
in  the  State  plan  to  do,  but  will  have  to  postpone  those  plans— 
building,  for  example,  five  towers  next  year—because  they  depend 
on support from the high-cost fund. 

So,  let’s  start  with  that.  We  have  a  third  of  wireless  carriers— 
the  wireless  carriers  are  paying  a  third  into  the  high-cost  funds.

Why shouldn’t they be able to continue to get the additional funds 
that they deserve, and that they have contributed to? 

Ms.  TATE.  Senator,  I  just  have  to  say,  the  safety  and  welfare  of 
citizens  everywhere  has  been  one  of  my  highest  priorities.  I  was  a 
State  official,  and  now  I’m  a  Federal  official.  And  I  want  you  to 
know that. I am concerned. 

At  the  same  time,  I  think  that  the  premise  of  your  question  is 
based  on  the  system  being  fair  right  now.  There  are  so  many  in-
equities  in  the  present  system.  Some  of  them  we’ve  already  talked 
about,  and  that  is  the  fact  that  the  wireless  carriers  receive  fund-
ing,  not  based  on  their  own  costs,  which,  in  most  cases,  are  much, 
much less than the ILEC cost, but they actually receive cost based 
on the embedded cost. 

The  other  thing  is  that,  when  we  look  at  that  cap—when  we 
looked  at  the  cap  in  the  CETC  side,  that’s  where  the  growth  was. 
So,  we  looked  for,  where  is  the  problem,  and  how  do  we  try  and 
provide a solution to that particular problem? 

And  I  guess  the  other  thing  is  that,  on  the  ILEC  side,  there  are 
caps.  There’s  the  cap  on  the  high-cost  fund,  there’s  a  cap  on  inter-
state  access.  And  we  have  other  caps  throughout  the  system, 
whether  it’s  E-Rate,  that  you  know  about,  or  the  rural  healthcare 
fund. So, this provided, actually, some parity as we made these de-
cisions. 

They  are  difficult  decisions,  I  agree  with  you.  I’m  from  a  very, 

very rural State. I’m concerned about these decisions, as well. 

Senator  SNOWE.  But  this  is  a  very  piecemeal  approach.  And  so, 
you’re  asking  one  sector,  and  certain  parts  of  America  to  bear  the 
disproportionate  burden  of  this  decision  because  of  the  inability  of 
the FCC to reach a consensus, or this Joint State Board, and even 
the U.S. Congress. But rural America should not be put at risk be-
cause  within  the  FCC  or  the  Joint  State  Board  you  have  not  been 
able  to  reach  a  consensus.  An  interim  measure,  at  the  minimum, 
is  going  to  be  18  months.  That’s  not  interim,  in  my  view,  number 
one.  Second,  by  imposing  a  cap,  I  think,  frankly,  it’s  going  to  be  a 
disincentive  to  reaching  a  consensus  within  the  FCC,  because 
you’ve  made  your  decision  to  control  the  costs  until  you  have  the 
ability  to  make  that  decision,  but  it’s  within  the  FCC.  The  Joint 
State  Board,  you  don’t  have  to  accept  their  recommendations, 
frankly.  The  FCC  has  a  responsibility,  as  well.  It’s  not  because 
they’re  saying,  ‘‘Well,  we’ll  wait  for  the  industry  to  reach  a  con-
sensus.’’ It’s all well and good, they should try to reach a consensus 
on  the  question  you  raised  about,  ‘‘What  are  the  true  costs?’’  and 
so  on,  and  we  all  agree  with  that.  But  that  doesn’t  mean  to  say 
that you have to accept a piecemeal approach that unfairly affects, 
one  sector  or  one  part  of  America.  And  that’s  what’s  happening 
now.  And  I  think  you  have  to  look  at  the  implications  of  this  deci-
sion, which I think are enormous and is going to place rural Amer-
ica at a tremendous disadvantage. So, do you agree? 

Ms.  TATE.  Obviously.  As  I’ve  said,  I’m  from  a  very  rural  State, 

too. I want—— 

Senator SNOWE. Well—— 
Ms.  TATE.—rural  areas  to  have  evolving  levels  of  services.  The 

Joint Board——

Ms.  TATE.  Once  again,  Senator,  you  know,  the  Joint  Board  has 
representatives  on  it  from  very  rural  areas,  from  Oregon  to 
Vermont, to very rural areas. And this was, once again, seven rea-
sonable  people  who  came  to  the  decision  that  the  problem  was  on 
the  CETC  side,  and  that’s  the  step  that  we  decided  to  make  in 
order to sustain the Fund at this time. 

Senator  SNOWE.  Well,  I  think  it’s  ignoring  and  overlooking  the 
magnitude  of  the  impact  of  that  decision,  frankly.  I  mean,  just  in 
my  State,  when  you’re  talking  about  postponing  five  towers,  this 
year,  as  a  result  of  that  cap,  I  mean,  that’s  just  the  beginning  of 
this process. And so, I think that, obviously, it’s going to have enor-
mous implications. And I don’t think that the FCC is being respon-
sible  by  accepting  that  decision,  based  on  what  the  implications 
are,  frankly.  And  it  may  well  be  that  you’re  all  sensitive  to  rural 
America,  but  you’re  not  looking  at  the  ultimate  consequences. 
That’s  why  I  submitted  a  letter  to  the  Commission.  The  Maine 
State  Legislature  has  passed  a  resolution,  you  know,  unanimously 
opposing,  this  recommendation,  because  it’s  going  to  have  enor-
mous  implications,  and  it’s  going  to  set  back  rural  America  by 
years  by  the  time  you  get  around  to  making  that  decision.  So,  I 
don’t  think  it’s  fair  to  put  them  in  that  position,  because  a  com-
prehensive solution cannot be agreed to. 

And, finally, when you’re talking about the charges, I am curious 
about  the  nature  of  the  charges.  From  the  second  quarter  of  2005 
to  the  third  quarter  of  2006,  the  USF  surcharge  hovered  between 
10.2  percent  and  10.5  percent;  fourth  quarter  2006,  the  FCC 
dropped  it  to  9.1  percent,  and  then,  in  the  second  quarter  of  2007, 
increased  it  to  11.7  percent.  It  hasn’t  been  that  high  since  early 
2005.  I  mean,  so  what  contributes  to  the  erratic  nature,  of  these 
increases? 

Ms. TATE. I believe the—— 
Senator SNOWE. And—— 
Ms.  TATE.—particular  instance  that  you’re  noting  was  from  one- 
time  payments  that  were  underpayments  that  came  in  from  the 
interexchange  carriers,  possibly  in  the  range  of  $500,000.  I  mean, 
I can find that and provide you the specific information. 

Once  again,  that  was  one  of  the  reasons  that  the  Joint  Board 
came up with a recommendation regarding a State cap rather than 
caps that might be based on quarterly fluctuations because of some 
payment into the Fund. 

Senator  SNOWE.  Well,  obviously  we’re  not  going  to  reach  an 
agreement  here  today,  regrettably,  but  I  just  want  to  reiterate  my 
opposition,  my  deepest  opposition  to  this  proposal,  because  I  don’t 
think  it’s  fair  to  rural  parts  of  America.  And,  as  Sheriff  Flannery 
will  tell  this  Committee,  what,  he  and  others  in  the  law  enforce-
ment community today go through to get a signal—and remember, 
half of the 9-1-1 calls come from wireless service. So people depend 
on it, they expect it. And so, the fact that we’re going to be denying 
them  these  additional  towers  over  the  next  few  years,  because 
that’s  what  it  means,  because  companies  have  to  make  their  long- 
term decisions and investments, and if they don’t have the predict-
ability  and  the  certainty  of  the  support  from  the  high-cost  fund, 
they’re  going  to  postpone  and  defer  those  decisions,  at  obviously, 
the expense of the rural parts of my State and across this country.

I  would  hope  that  the  FCC  would  reconsider  this  decision  because 
of the enormity of the impact it’s going to have. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator  STEVENS.  Thank  you.  No  Senator  has  any  further  ques-

tions of Ms. Tate, I hope. 

Thank you very much. You’ve been—— 
Ms. TATE. Thank you. 
Senator  STEVENS.—very  patient.  And  I  think  you’ve  represented 
the FCC very well. I’m not saying I agree with the FCC, but thank 
you for your participation. 

Ms. TATE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator  STEVENS.  We’ll  now  call  panel  2.  You  want  to  recess  for 

just a couple of minutes? 

Our  next  panel  is  John  Rooney,  President  and  Chief  Executive 
Officer of U.S. Cellular; Mr. Roger Nishi, Chairman of the Organi-
zation  for  Promotion  and  Advancement  of  Small  Telecommuni-
cations Companies; Mr. Jonathan Foxman, President and Chief Ex-
ecutive Officer of Chinook Wireless; Mr. Joel Lubin, Vice President 
of  Regulatory  Planning  and  Policy  for  AT&T;  and  Mr.  Everett  B. 
Flannery,  Jr.,  the  Chief  Deputy  of  Kennebec  County  Sheriff’s  Of-
fice, Augusta, Maine. 

Gentlemen,  the  Chairman  has  adopted  the  benign  policy  of  urg-
ing  witnesses  to  keep  their  statements  short,  and  it  seems  to  be 
working  better  than  my  policy  of  limiting  them  precisely  to  time 
limits.  So,  please  proceed,  with  the  idea  that  others  are  following 
you,  and  we  would  hope  we’d  have  a  chance  to  ask  you  questions. 

Our first witness would be John Rooney.

STATEMENT OF JOHN E. ROONEY, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION 

Mr. ROONEY. Good morning, Mr. Vice Chairman and members of 
the  Committee.  My  name  is  Jack  Rooney,  and  I’m  the  President 
and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  United  States  Cellular  Corporation. 
I want to thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. 
U.S.  Cellular  provides  wireless  service  in  nearly  200  markets 
across the country, including many of the states represented in this 
Committee, including California, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, New 
Hampshire, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, and West 
Virginia.  The  overwhelming  majority  of  the  geography  we  serve  is 
rural  in  character.  We  currently  receive  Universal  Service  support 
in seven States, including Washington, Oregon, and Maine. 

I  am  here  to  advocate  reform  of  the  Universal  Service  program 
in a comprehensive and constructive manner. U.S. Cellular strong-
ly opposes capping support to wireless carriers. Today we are using 
that  support  to  provide  rural  consumers  with  access  to  essential 
services in ways that would not otherwise be possible. For example, 
in Maine we are using support to construct 21 sites in small towns, 
such  as  Grand  Isle,  Union,  and  Peru.  In  Oregon,  we  are  using 
funds to build 11 new sites in places like Emigrant Lake, Wallowa, 
and  Butte  Falls.  Every  cell  site  we  build  provides  critical  public 
safety benefits. At a time when the public is increasingly concerned 
about having E–911 service, it scarcely bears mention that, without 
a cell site, E–911 is useless.

I  believe  that  there  are  five  factors  to  consider  when  reviewing 

the current situation. 

First, freezing support to wireless carriers harms rural customers 
by  denying  them  the  improved  service  that  we’re  ready  to  deliver. 
According to the FCC’s own data, between 1995 and 2005 the aver-
age  cost  of  wireless  service  dropped  from  43  cents  per  minute  to  7 
cents  per  minute,  while  usage  increased  from  119  minutes  to  740 
minutes over that same period. This is great news for people living 
in  areas  where  network  service  quality  is  high.  They  see  tremen-
dous  savings  in  their  phone  bills,  sometimes  $50  or  more  per 
month.  However,  these  benefits  are  not  available  to  rural  Ameri-
cans who live in areas with poor signal quality. 

Second,  since  1996,  more  than  $22  billion  of  consumer  contribu-
tions  to  the  Fund  have  gone  to  landline  carriers,  while  less  than 
$2  billion  have  gone  to  wireless  carriers.  Consumers  have  a  right 
to  know  why  they’re  being  asked  to  continue  to  provide  $3  billion 
a year to a service that they are abandoning in droves. 

Third,  U.S.  Cellular’s  efforts  to  serve  customers  in  the  States  of 
Illinois  and  Missouri  are  examples  of  why  the  cap  is  a  bad  idea. 
Under a cap, these states would not draw enough funds collectively 
to  put  up  one  cell  site.  In  Missouri,  we’re  poised  to  build  39  new 
sites in the next 2 years to accelerate our network construction. In 
Illinois, we have committed to building 121 new sites over the next 
5  years.  If  a  cap  is  imposed,  these  investments  will  not  happen 
anytime  soon.  Rural  citizens  are  demanding  wireless  service,  and 
if the Committee has any doubt about this, I’m told that there are 
over  2,700  comments  on  file  at  the  FCC  from  consumers  opposing 
the cap, and that the only comments favoring a cap come from our 
friends  in  the  wireline  industry  who  fear  the  emergence  of  high- 
quality wireless services in their territories. 

Fourth,  wireline  carriers  in  rural  areas  have  lost  10  percent  of 
their  access  lines  over  the  last  3  years.  However,  they  continue  to 
draw $3 billion annually. When we lose customers, we lost support. 
And that’s the way it ought to be. 

Fifth,  the  idea  of  a  wireless-only  cap  is  wildly  unfair.  I  under-
stand  that  all  the  FCC’s  Universal  Service  rules  must  be  competi-
tively neutral in their effect, and there is no way that this discrimi-
natory proposal passes muster. 

I  would  like  to  rebut  a  common  misconception,  that  the  wireless 
industry is not accountable. In most States, we file detailed reports 
demonstrating our accountability for what we do with these funds, 
and  I  assure  you  that  this  company  uses  Federal  funds  very  re-
sponsibly. 

The  Joint  Board’s  rationale  for  a  cap  is  that  the  Fund  will  be-
come unsustainable, but they don’t explain what that means. If the 
Senators  believe  the  Board’s  assessments,  then  why  not  ask  the 
wireline industry to share the burden? 

Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee,  I  greatly  appre-
ciate  the  opportunity  to  discuss  this  issue  with  you  today,  and  ap-
preciate your interest.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN E. ROONEY, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION 

Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chairman,  members  of  the  Committee, 
my name is Jack Rooney and I am President and Chief Executive Officer of United 
States  Cellular  Corporation—known  to  our  customers  as  U.S.  Cellular.  Thank  you 
for the opportunity to appear before you today to share with you the many benefits 
our  company  has  been  able  to  bring  to  rural  America  as  a  result  of  the  Universal 
Service  Fund,  and  the  very  harmful  effects  that  will  result  if  the  current  proposal 
regarding a cap on this Fund is adopted. 

U.S.  Cellular  provides  wireless  service  in  nearly  200  markets  located  in  regional 
clusters  across  the  country,  including  many  of  the  states  represented  on  this  Com-
mittee  such  as  California,  Maine,  Minnesota,  Missouri,  New  Hampshire,  Oregon, 
South  Carolina,  Texas,  Washington  and  West  Virginia.  The  overwhelming  majority 
of the geography we serve is rural in character. 

You should also know that our opinions and perspectives on the Universal Service 
Fund  are  based  on  our  experience  in  receiving  Universal  Service  support  in  seven 
states that include Washington, Oregon, and Maine. 

I am here to bring you good news about what wireless carriers like U.S. Cellular 
are  accomplishing  in  rural  America  with  Universal  Service  funding.  In  addition,  I 
am  here  to  advocate  reform  of  the  Universal  Service  program  in  a  comprehensive, 
constructive  manner  that  promotes  both  the  Universal  Service  and  competition 
mandates  of  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996;  and,  at  the  same  time,  holds  the 
entire  industry  accountable  for  the  funds  it  receives.  Specifically,  U.S.  Cellular 
strongly  opposes  capping  funding  only  to  wireless  carriers  while  continuing  to  fund 
wireline carriers without reforming the rules. 

Today,  we  at  U.S.  Cellular  are  using  Universal  Service  support  to  provide  con-
sumers and communities with access to essential services they deserve in ways that 
would not otherwise be possible. For example, in Maine, we are constructing 21 cell 
sites  in  small  towns  such  as  Grand  Isle,  Union  and  Peru.  USF  funds  are  allowing 
us to provide consumers and communities with access to essential services they de-
serve  and  pay  for—for  the  first  time.  In  Oregon,  we  are  using  the  funds  to  build 
11 new sites in places such as Emigrant Lake, Wallowa and Butte Falls, among oth-
ers.  In  every  state  where  we  receive  assistance,  we  are  deploying  networks  in 
sparsely populated communities where there is no logical business case that can jus-
tify the cost. 

Let’s  also  remember  that  every  cell  site  we  build  provides  critical  public  safety 
benefits.  In  every  place  where  we  build  a  new  cellular  site,  consumers  receive  as 
much as 144 square miles of improved coverage, including all the emergency service 
benefits of wireless, such as the ability to make a 911 call, and to access the locating 
features of E–911. At a time when the public is increasingly concerned about having 
E–911 functionality, it scarcely bears mention that without a cell site, E–911 is use-
less. 

I  should  also  highlight  the  outstanding  performance  of  wireless  systems  during 
the recent flooding in Missouri, wind storms in Washington and Oregon, and many 
other  natural  disasters.  In  each  instance,  our  networks  either  continued  to  operate 
without  interruption  throughout  the  crisis,  or  were  restored  quickly  with  back-up 
battery power or generators so that service disruptions were confined to minutes or 
hours, not days or weeks. In fact, it’s worth noting that this reliability and ubiquity 
makes wireless the preferred service for displaced people and first responders. Again 
and again, our wireless networks have proven to be much more robust and reliable 
than wireline networks. 

The  key  issue  before  us  today,  however,  is  what  the  Joint  Board  has  overlooked 
in  its  rush  to  throw  a  cap  on  just  the  wireless  portion  of  the  fund.  I  would  suggest 
we look backward, and reflect thoughtfully on Congress’ intent in enacting the Tele-
communications Act of 1996 and the successes of Universal Service funding to date, 
before we talk about what should be done going forward. 

Continued  growth  in  Universal  Service  Fund  payments  has  raised  the  question 
of whether the program is sustainable given the current methodology it uses to col-
lect and distribute funds. What must be remembered is that Congress, in its enact-
ment of the 1996 Telecom Act, intended for rural consumers to have the same access 
to advanced services and competitive prices as their urban counterparts. This access 
should come from providers in a competitive market, governed by technology-neutral 
rules. In short, the growth of the Fund is not some unintended aberration; it is the 
direct result of a conscious and enlightened public policy. 

I believe that there are five factors to consider when reviewing the current situa-

tion:

1. The Vast Majority of Americans Prefer Wireless Service, and Rural Con-
sumers Want Their Cell Phones To Work Just as Much as Those Living 
in Urban America 

Freezing  support  to  wireless  carriers  diminishes  our  ability  to  invest  in  rural 
America  and  harms  rural  consumers  by  denying  them  the  improved  service  that 
we’re ready to deliver. 

Let  me  explain.  According  to  the  FCC’s  own  data,  between  1995  and  2005,  the 
average  cost  for  wireless  service  dropped  from  43  cents  per  minute  to  7  cents  per 
minute,  while  monthly  usage  has  increased  from  119  minutes  to  740  minutes  over 
the same period.1 

This  is  great  news  for  people  living  in  areas  where  network  service  quality  is 
high.  They  see  tremendous  savings  in  their  telephone  bills,  sometimes  $50  or  more 
per  month  over  wireline  calling  plans.  However,  these  benefits  are  not  available  to 
rural  Americans  who  live  in  areas  with  poor  signal  quality.  The  use  of  support  to 
drive  these  consumer  savings  is  exactly  what  Congress  intended  and  the  proposal 
to cap support only insulates wireline carriers from competition. 
2.  Wireline  Networks  That  Were  Built  and  Paid  for  Decades  Ago  Have 

Received 90 Percent of Consumer USF Contributions Since 1996 

Since 1996, more than $22 billion of consumer contributions to the Fund has gone 
to  rural  landline  carriers,  while  less  than  $2  billion  has  gone  to  rural  wireless  car-
riers.  Consumers  have  a  right  to  know  where  that  $22  billion  went  and  why  they 
are being asked to continue to provide $3 billion per year to a service that they are 
abandoning in droves. Support should go to the service that consumers choose—not 
the service that regulators force them to choose. 
3. A Freeze Will Disproportionately Harm Consumers in Some States 

U.S. Cellular’s efforts to serve customers in the States of Missouri and Illinois are 
examples  of  why  this  is  a  bad  idea.  A  freeze  on  funds  to  these  states  means  that 
rural  consumers  have  to  pay  in,  but  get  nothing—or  next  to  nothing—in  return.  I 
understand  that  Illinois  citizens  contribute  roughly  $265  million  per  year,  while 
Missouri’s citizens contribute roughly $126 million.2 Yet, Illinois draws out less than 
$2,000 per year for wireless, and Missouri draws out roughly $125,000 per year for 
wireless. Collectively, these states would not draw enough funds to put up one new 
cell site. 

Assuming  a  cap  is  not  instituted  in  Missouri,  we  are  now  poised  to  use  support 
to build 39 new cell sites in the next 2 years to accelerate our network construction 
in underserved rural areas where our network requires significant additional invest-
ment.  In  Illinois,  we  have  committed  to  building  121  new  sites  over  5  years  if  we 
are  designated  later  this  year  as  expected.  This  investment  will  improve  service  to 
over  2  million  rural  consumers.  And  that’s  just  the  beginning,  as  we’ll  continue  to 
invest all available support each subsequent year. 

For  consumers,  this  is  no  small  matter.  There  are  substantial  underserved  rural 
areas in both of these states where people are demanding wireless service, and with-
out  support  they  aren’t  going  to  see  that  investment.  If  the  Committee  has  any 
doubt  about  this,  I  am  told  that  there  are  roughly  2,500  comments  on  file  at  the 
FCC  from  consumers  opposing  the  cap,  and  that  the  only  comments  favoring  a  cap 
come from our friends in the wireline industry who fear the emergence of high-qual-
ity wireless service in their territories. 
4. Support Must Go to the Carrier That the Customer Chooses 

Why  should  wireline  carriers  get  subsidized  even  when  they  lose  customers? 
Wireline  carriers  in  rural  areas  have  lost  10  percent  of  their  access  lines  over  the 
past 3 years; however, they continue to draw $3 billion annually. When we lose cus-
tomers, we lose support, and that’s the way it should be. As consumers increasingly 
choose  wireless  for  their  voice  needs,  we  should  be  receiving  an  increasing  share  of 
the  Fund  so  we  can  provide  rural  consumers  with  the  high-quality  service  they  de-
serve. If any one sector deserves heightened scrutiny, I would argue it’s the landline 
providers  that  continue  to  benefit  from  the  program  while  being  insulated  from  fi-
nancial and market realities. 
5.  The  Cap  as  Proposed  by  the  Joint  Board  Is  Not  Competitively  Neutral 
Finally, the idea of a wireless-only cap is wildly unfair in that wireless contributes 
the  biggest  share  to  the  Universal  Service  Fund,  yet  we  draw  out  the  smallest 
amount.  All  of  the  FCC’s  Universal  Service  rules  must  be  competitively  neutral  in

their  effect,  and  there  is  no  way  that  this  discriminatory  proposal  passes  muster. 
Nor does the unofficial freeze by the FCC on new ETC petitions. 

To be completely frank, while disappointing, the Joint Board’s decision wasn’t all 
that  surprising  to  us.  The  FCC  has  been  treating  our  petitions  for  ETC  status  as 
if  the  cap  has  already  been  in  place  for  some  time.  The  FCC  has  not  acted  on  any 
of  our  petitions  for  ETC  status,  despite  our  obvious  qualifications  to  be  designated. 
Some  have  been  sitting  there  for  3  years.  So  we  cannot  deliver  the  benefits  de-
scribed above to rural consumers in New Hampshire, North Carolina, Virginia, Ten-
nessee, and New York. 

I  would  also  like  to  rebut  a  common  misconception  I  hear  repeatedly  about  the 
wireless  industry:  that  we  are  not  accountable.  In  most  states,  U.S.  Cellular  files 
detailed  reports  demonstrating  our  accountability  for  what  we  do  with  these  public 
funds.  I  can  assure  you  that  this  company  is  using  Federal  support  in  the  manner 
that  Congress  originally  intended:  to  provide  rural  consumers  with  high-quality 
service  that  is  comparable  to  what  is  available  in  urban  areas.  Make  no  mistake, 
we  are  delivering  on  our  promise  and  will  continue  to  do  so  in  the  coming  years 
with support from the USF. Wireline carriers do not have the same level of account-
ability, and we believe the Universal Service system is significantly over-subsidizing 
their  networks  because  the  system  provides  support  on  a  ‘‘the  more  you  spend,  the 
more you get’’ basis. 

The Joint Board’s rationale for a cap is that the Fund will become unsustainable. 

It doesn’t, however, explain what that means. 

Nor  do  the  Board’s  numbers  add  up.  We  calculate  that  even  if  you  accept  the 
Board’s  unsupported  projection  that  the  Fund  could  increase  by  another  $1  billion 
in  the  next  year,  this  would  add  only  31  cents  to  the  monthly  Federal  Universal 
Service  charge  to  consumers.  Can  someone  please  tell  me,  how  does  this  represent 
a  crisis—especially  when  wireline  carriers  continue  to  lose  lines  but  are  allowed  to 
draw $3 billion per year? 

If  the  Senators  believe  that  such  an  increase  is  too  much  for  consumers  to  bear, 
then why not ask the wireline industry to share the burden? After all, wireline car-
riers draw three times what we do. 

A  much  more  responsible  and  competitively  neutral  fix  is  for  the  system  to  only 
provide  support  to  the  carrier  that  serves  the  customer.  The  FCC  is  fully  capable 
of  figuring  out  how  much  USF  support  is  needed  in  a  given  area  to  provide  con-
sumers  with  the  ability  to  choose  the  service  that  best  suits  their  needs.  I  am  told 
that’s what Congress promised. Until that happens, Fund growth is not going to be 
controlled and consumers are not going to see the benefits described above. 

Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee,  I  greatly  appreciate  the  oppor-
tunity  to  discuss  this  issue  with  you  today  and  appreciate  your  interest.  I  believe 
that  the  Joint  Board’s  ultimate  recommendation,  and  the  FCC’s  subsequent  deci-
sion, will have a profound impact on rural Americans in your states, and on the host 
of  competitive  service-providers  that  are  excited  about  offering  the  best  tele-
communications services possible. On behalf of U.S. Cellular, we hope that you can 
help  ensure  that  those  services  are  deployed  as  quickly  and  efficiently  as  possible 
without resorting to draconian and ill-conceived solutions.

Mr. NISHI. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and distinguished mem-
bers of the Committee. I’m Roger Nishi, from Waitsfield and Cham-
plain  Valley  Telecom,  in  Vermont,  and  I’m  the  current  Chairman 
of  OPASTCO,  the  Organization  for  the  Promotion  and  Advance-
ment  of  Small  Telecommunications  Companies.  Our  company  is 
also a member of NTCA, the National Telecommunications Cooper-
ative  Association.  Today,  I  will  speak  on  their  behalf,  as  well  as 
WTA,  the  Western  Telecommunications  Alliance,  and  ITTA,  the 
Independent Telephone and Telecommunications Alliance. 

Thank you for inviting me here today to testify on behalf of these 
fine  organizations  who  are  the  founding  members  of  the  Coalition 
to Keep America Connected. 

Let  me  start  by  emphasizing  that  all  four  organizations  applaud 
what  the  Joint  Board  has  done,  and  in  recognizing  that  the  pro-

gram is in serious jeopardy of becoming unsustainable if immediate 
action is not taken. 

The  four  organizations  strongly  support  the  recommendation  to 
immediately  impose  an  interim  cap  in  the  high-cost  support  re-
ceived by competitive eligible telecommunications carriers. We urge 
Congress to also support the recommendation. 

We believe the recommendation is the most logical and equitable 
way in which to rein in the rapid growth of the high-cost Universal 
Service  program  while  the  FCC  and  Congress  contemplate  long- 
term reforms to sustain the viability of the whole Universal Service 
program,  which  includes  schools  and  libraries,  rural  healthcare, 
and  the  low-income  programs.  So,  the  whole  universe,  we  believe, 
needs to be looked at, in terms of making sure it’s sustainable. 

We  believe  that  any  entity  or  person  who  proclaims  support  for 
strong and viable Universal Service in the future should, and must, 
support the Joint Board’s recommended interim plan. 

The  adoption  by  the  FCC  of  an  interim  cap  on  high-cost  support 
provided  to  CETCs  is  equitable.  Since  1993,  caps  have  limited  the 
amount of support available to rural incumbent local exchange car-
riers  from  the  high-cost  loop  support  mechanism.  Since  July  2001, 
when  caps  were  re-based  by  the  FCC,  rural  ILECs  have  foregone 
$2.5 billion in Federal high-cost support. Waitsfield and Champlain 
Valley Telecom has lost a significant amount of high-cost loop sup-
port. 

I  will  share  that  this  uncertainty  in  funding  levels  has  made  it 
more difficult to budget and also to plan for the long term. But our 
company,  like  hundreds  of  rural  companies  throughout  the  United 
States,  has  always  had  a  community-first  approach  to  doing  busi-
ness,  and  this  means  building  to  all,  and  serving  all  of  our  cus-
tomers,  rather  than  looking  to  only  serve  the  lucrative  and  easy- 
to-serve customers. 

In  their  recommendation,  the  Joint  Board  states  that  the  iden-
tical  support  rule  is  dated,  and  may  not  be  the  appropriate  ap-
proach  to  calculating  support  for  CETCs.  The  four  associations 
couldn’t agree more with this. The identical support rule bases the 
support  received  by  CETCs  on  the  unrelated  costs  of  the  rural 
ILECs  providing  ubiquitous  service  throughout  their  territories. 
For years, CETCs—primarily wireless carriers—have reaped wind-
falls  of  support  through  the  illogical  identical  support  rule.  More-
over,  the  rules  have  allowed  CETCs,  upon  designation,  to  imme-
diately begin receiving the rural ILEC’s cost-based per-line support 
amount  for  all  of  their  existing  customers  in  the  designated  terri-
tory whom they were more than likely serving successfully without 
any such support. We advocate the elimination of the identical sup-
port  rule,  and  believe  that  CETCs  should  be  required  to  dem-
onstrate their own costs in order to potentially qualify for support. 
At  the  same  time,  we  need  to  keep  in  mind  that  this  rec-
ommendation  is  only  interim.  This  is  only  an  interim  cap.  Dollars 
will  continue  to  flow  to  the  CETCs.  And,  most  importantly,  an  in-
terim cap on CETCs will not harm the availability of the Universal 
Service  throughout  the  country,  since  virtually  all  Americans  have 
access to service from at least one eligible telecommunications car-
rier, and, in most cases, more than one.

The  organizations  feel  that  it’s  important  for  the  FCC  to  adopt 
the  recommendations  without  modification.  The  Joint  Board  has 
done  an  excellent  job,  and  thought  this  out  in  a  very  reasonable 
manner. 

And, in the long term, Congress and the FCC should expand the 
base of contributors to Universal Service, and, as previously stated, 
the  identical  support  rule  should  be  eliminated,  and  CETCs’  sup-
port should be based on their own costs. 

To conclude, short-term action is required for long-term stability. 
And,  therefore,  Congress  should  advocate  for  the  FCC’s  immediate 
adoption of the Joint Board’s recommendation to impose an interim 
cap  on  high-cost  support  provided  to  CETCs  without  modification. 
The recommended cap would effectively and fairly stem the rapid 
growth  in  support  to  CETCs  caused  in  large  part  by  the  identical 
support  rule  while  Congress,  the  FCC,  and  all  the  parties  in  this 
room  work  together  to  come  up  with  comprehensive  reforms  that 
will address the issues for the long term. 

The  Joint  Board’s  recommendation  is  an  interim  step  to  protect 
the  Universal  Service  Fund  from  exploding  even  further,  and  will 
benefit all eligible telecommunications providers, both wireline and 
wireless, in the long term. 

Once  again,  the  organizations  believe  that  anyone  who  claims  to 
be  a  supporter  of  Universal  Service  and  the  Fund  and  its  goal 
should be a strong advocate for this recommendation. 

Thank you for your time today. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Nishi follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROGER NISHI,  CHAIRMAN,  ORGANIZATION FOR THE 
PROMOTION AND ADVANCEMENT OF SMALL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES 
(OPASTCO);  VICE PRESIDENT OF INDUSTRY RELATIONS,  WAITSFIELD AND CHAM-
PLAIN VALLEY TELECOM; ON BEHALF OF NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COOPER-
ATIVE ASSOCIATION; WESTERN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ALLIANCE; AND INDEPENDENT 
TELEPHONE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ALLIANCE 
Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  Roger  Nishi,  Vice  President 
of  Industry  Relations  for  Waitsfield  and  Champlain  Valley  Telecom  headquartered 
in Waitsfield, Vermont. Also, I serve as Chairman of the Board of the Organization 
for  the  Promotion  and  Advancement  of  Small  Telecommunications  Companies 
(OPASTCO) and am a member of the National Telecommunications Cooperative As-
sociation  (NTCA).  I  am  also  speaking  for  the  Western  Telecommunications  Alliance 
(WTA)  and  the  Independent  Telephone  and  Telecommunications  Alliance  (ITTA). 
Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  today  on  behalf  of  all  of  these  organizations 
who are the founding members of the Coalition to Keep America Connected. 

Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom is a privately owned, independent com-
pany  now  in  its  third  generation  of  ownership  by  the  Haskins  family.  We  provide 
local  and  long  distance  telephone  service,  high-speed  Internet  service  to  the  Mad 
River  and  central  Champlain  Valley  regions  and  cable  television  to  our  customers 
in  the  Mad  River  Valley.  The  company  is  proud  that  it  has  recently  achieved  one 
hundred percent coverage of broadband service to our telephone customers. 

All  four  organizations  strongly  support  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Uni-
versal  Service’s  (Joint  Board)  recommendation  to  immediately  impose  an  interim 
cap  on  the  high-cost  support  received  by  competitive  eligible  telecommunications 
carriers  (CETCs)  and  we  urge  Congress  to  also  support  the  recommendation.  It  is 
important  that  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  adopt  the  rec-
ommendation without modification. The recommendation is the most logical and eq-
uitable way in which to rein in the rapid growth of the High-Cost Universal Service 
program while the FCC and Congress contemplate long-term reforms to sustain the 
Universal Service Fund (USF). 

The adoption by the FCC of an interim cap on only the high-cost support provided 
to  CETCs  is  equitable.  Since  1993,  caps  have  limited  the  amount  of  support  avail-
able to rural incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) from the high-cost loop sup-

port  (HCLS)  mechanism,  which  is  the  largest  of  the  support  mechanisms  through 
which  these  carriers  receive  funding.  Since  July  2001,  when  these  caps  were  ‘‘re- 
based’’  by  the  FCC,  rural  ILECs  have  forgone  over  $2.5  billion  in  Federal  high-cost 
support. My company, Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom, has lost $6.23 mil-
lion in high-cost loop support in the last 6 years. The capping mechanism on HCLS 
has created significant unpredictability for rural ILECs from year to year. This has 
constrained our ability to make further improvements to our local network. Yet, we 
have  persevered  because  of  our  commitment  to  our  community.  Our  company,  like 
hundreds of rural companies throughout the United States, has always had a ‘‘com-
munity  first’’  approach  to  doing  business.  And  this  means  serving  all  of  our  cus-
tomers  rather  than  looking  to  serve  only  the  lucrative  and  easy  to  serve  customers 
as  so  many  of  our  competitors  do.  We  must  recognize  that  since  CETCs  have  come 
into  existence,  the  high-cost  loop  support  they  receive  has  been  permitted  to  grow 
unfettered as the number of CETCs has grown and as their line counts have grown. 
It  is  baseless  to  assert  that  an  interim  cap  applied  only  to  support  received  by 
CETCs would not be competitively neutral. 

In  their  recommendation,  the  Joint  Board  states  that  the  identical  support  rule 
is dated and may not be the appropriate approach to calculating support for CETCs. 
The  identical  support  rule  bases  the  support  received  by  CETCs  on  the  unrelated 
costs of the rural ILEC providing ubiquitous service throughout the area. For years 
CETCs—primarily  wireless  carriers—have  reaped  windfalls  of  support  through  the 
illogical  identical  support  rule.  Moreover,  the  rules  have  allowed  CETCs,  upon  des-
ignation,  to  immediately  begin  receiving  the  rural  ILEC’s  cost-based  per-line  sup-
port  amount  for  all  of  their  existing  customers  in  the  designated  territory,  whom 
they  were  successfully  serving  without  any  support.  Imposing  an  interim  cap  on 
CETC support is a necessary measure to contain the rapid growth in unjustified dis-
tributions  to  these  carriers  while  Congress  and  the  FCC  address  long-term  policy 
changes  to  the  USF.  We  advocate  the  elimination  of  the  identical  support  rule  and 
believe  that  CETCs  should  be  required  to  demonstrate  their  own  costs  in  order  to 
potentially qualify for support. 

AT&T, the largest wireless carrier in the United States, has submitted a plan for 
stabilizing  the  High-Cost  program  in  the  short  term  that  proposes  much  bolder 
steps  for  addressing  the  growth  in  CETC  support  than  the  Joint  Board’s  Rec-
ommended Decision. Specifically, AT&T’s plan would immediately halt the approval 
of new CETCs and impose a freeze on the number of lines for which wireless CETCs 
receive high-cost support. Also, it would reduce by 25 percent the support that wire-
less  CETCs  receive  through  the  support  mechanisms  designed  to  replace  access 
charges. If the Nation’s largest wireless carrier is willing to acknowledge the source 
of the runaway growth in the High-Cost program, and recommend a strong, targeted 
interim plan to address it, the FCC should be willing to adopt the more modest rec-
ommendations  of  the  Joint  Board.  And  this  Committee  should  encourage  the  FCC 
to support the Joint Board recommendation. 

The  Joint  Board  points  out  that  as  a  result  of  the  rapid  and  excessive  growth  in 
support received by CETCs, the High-Cost program is in serious jeopardy of becom-
ing  unsustainable  if  immediate  action  is  not  taken.  Support  for  CETCs  has  grown 
from  $15  million  in  2001  to  almost  $1  billion  in  2006  and  based  on  current  esti-
mates,  the  support  received  by  these  carriers  will  reach  at  least  $1.28  billion  in 
2007,  almost  $2  billion  in  2008,  and  $2.5  billion  in  2009  if  action  is  not  taken  to 
contain  it.  In  addition,  the  USF  contribution  factor  for  second  quarter  2007  is  11.7 
percent which is the highest it has ever been. The chart attached at the end of this 
testimony  illustrates  these  points.  The  Joint  Board’s  recommendation  to  impose  an 
emergency,  interim  cap  on  the  support  received  by  CETCs  is  essential  to  stabilize 
the  size  of  the  High-Cost  program  until  measures  can  be  adopted  that  will  sustain 
the  program  for  the  long  term.  Any  entity  or  person  who  proclaims  support  for  a 
strong and viable USF in the future should support the Joint Board’s recommended 
interim plan. 

The  recommended  interim  cap  obviously  would  not  stop  funding  from  continuing 
to flow to CETCs, nor would it adversely affect wireless service in rural areas. Most 
importantly,  an  interim  cap  on  CETCs  support  would  not  harm  the  availability  of 
Universal  Service  throughout  the  country  since  virtually  all  Americans  have  access 
to  service  from  at  least  one  eligible  telecommunications  carrier  (the  ILEC)  and,  in 
most cases, more than one. 

The  organizations  that  I  am  speaking  for  today  agree  with  the  Joint  Board’s  rec-
ommendation  for  the  duration  of  the  interim  cap  to  be  1  year  from  the  date  of  any 
Joint Board recommended decision on comprehensive high-cost Universal Service re-
form. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the FCC to act on a Joint Board 
recommendation within 1 year after receiving it. Therefore, by 1 year from the date 
of  a  Joint  Board  recommendation  on  comprehensive  Universal  Service  reform,  the

46 

FCC  will  adopt  an  Order  that  provides  a  long  term  approach  to  addressing  the  ex-
cessive and unjustified growth in CETC funding. 

We are also in agreement with the Joint Board’s recommendation to impose a cap 
on CETC support for each state. This approach would encourage state commissions 
to  be  very  judicious  in  their  decisions  regarding  applications  for  eligible  tele-
communications carrier designation, because the designation of any additional eligi-
ble  telecommunications  carriers  would  not  draw  additional  Federal  dollars  into  the 
state;  it  would  simply  require  a  fixed  amount  of  funding  to  be  reallocated  among 
all of the CETCs in the state. At the same time, a state-based cap would still allow 
state commissions the flexibility to designate additional eligible telecommunications 
carriers if they believe that it will serve the public interest. 

In  the  long  term,  Congress  and  the  FCC  should  expand  the  base  of  contributors 
to  the  USF.  And,  as  previously  stated,  the  identical  support  rule  should  be  elimi-
nated and CETC support should be based on their own costs. 

As  I  stated  previously,  Congress  should  urge  the  FCC  to  quickly  adopt  the  Joint 
Board’s recommendation. The recommended cap will not harm rural consumers and 
will  not  take  support  away  from  rural  America.  As  I  have  pointed  out,  ILECs  are 
not  responsible  for  escalating  the  size  of  the  program.  Consumers  are  paying  more 
so  that  a  narrow  class  of  carriers  can  receive  support  that  is  not  based  on  their 
costs. The Joint Board’s recommendation is a vital step toward fixing this problem. 
In  conclusion,  Congress  should  advocate  for  the  FCC’s  immediate  adoption  of  the 
Joint  Board’s  recommendation  to  impose  an  interim  cap  on  high-cost  support  pro-
vided  to  CETCs,  without  modification.  The  recommended  cap  would  effectively  and 
fairly stem the rapid growth in support to CETCs—caused in large part by the iden-
tical  support  rule—while  Congress  and  the  FCC  consider  comprehensive  reforms  to 
the  High-Cost  program  that  will  address  the  issue  for  the  long  term.  The  Joint 
Board’s recommendation is an interim step to protect the USF from exploding even 
further  and  would  benefit  all  eligible  telecommunications  carriers,  including 
wireline,  wireless  and  broadband  services.  Once  again,  anyone  who  claims  to  be  a 
supporter  of  the  Universal  Service  Fund  and  its  goals  should  be  a  strong  advocate 
for this recommendation. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF JONATHAN D. FOXMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

CHINOOK WIRELESS 

Mr. FOXMAN. Mr. Vice Chairman and members of the Committee, 
thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  be  here  and  testify  before  you.  I 
appreciate your focus on this matter. 

Chinook  Wireless  is  a  small  to  mid-sized  company  providing 
wireless  services  to  customers  throughout  Montana  and  northern 
Wyoming. We also recently acquired licenses to provide these serv-
ices throughout the rest of Wyoming and the western Dakotas. 

We own and operate our own network of cell sites and switching 
core,  call  center,  and  retail  stores  all  in  Montana  and  Wyoming, 
connecting us intimately with our portion of rural America. We be-
lieve  we  are  answering  the  urgent  need  for  better  telecommuni-
cations  services  and  public  safety  in  rural  America.  To  date,  we 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:14 May 07, 2012 Jkt 074012 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74012.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

47 

have  done  so  without  any  support  from  the  Universal  Service  pro-
gram or any other public program; however, with that support, we 
could do so much more to answer what is truly an urgent need. 

As  a  privately  funded  business,  we  have  to  build  and  operate  as 
efficiently as possible. Our lenders and investors set very finite lim-
its,  and  they  won’t  fund  infrastructure  without  a  business  case  to 
support  it.  In  many  of  the  rural  areas  where  wireless  is  most  ur-
gently  needed,  particularly  for  public  safety,  we  wouldn’t  earn 
enough  revenue  to  justify  the  necessary  investment,  yet  those  citi-
zens  deserve  and  demand  the  benefits  of  wireless  service,  too.  The 
fundamental problem is that the high cost of deploying cell sites in 
these areas, while so important for public safety, economic develop-
ment,  and  other  reasons,  would  not  generate  the  necessary  rev-
enue.  We  recognize  the  need,  but  we  simply  cannot  meet  it  with 
private funding alone. 

Chinook  has  applied  for  State  certification  to  receive  Universal 
Service funds precisely so we can answer the unmet needs of rural 
America.  For  us,  and  for  other  CETCs  like  us,  the  Joint  Board’s 
recommended  cap  would  limit,  or  even  eliminate,  our  ability  to 
meet  those  needs.  At  the  same  time,  though,  it  would  continue  to 
fund  incumbent  carriers  in  those  areas.  This  is  simply  not  equi-
table. What best serves the public interest is fair competition. Com-
petition  brings  prices  down,  and  service  quality  up,  and  increases 
the choices available to consumers. We, therefore, urge Congress to 
insist  that  any  action  taken  by  the  Commission  be  fair  and  com-
petitively neutral. 

We also urge Congress to reconsider whether an interim measure 
is necessary at all. Instead, greater efforts could be made to rapidly 
and  diligently  fix  the  Universal  Service  system.  The  FCC  has 
worked on this issue for 11 years, and has more than enough infor-
mation now to make a fair determination. It could easily adopt re-
forms  within  1  year  without  using  a  cap.  It  only  took  a  year  for 
the  Commission  to  implement  spectrum  auctions,  and  the  agency 
implemented local competition under the 1996 Act in a single year. 
This  is  no  different,  just  another  complex  undertaking  that  the 
agency  certainly  does  have  the  staff  expertise  and  resources  to  ac-
complish. 

Finally,  we  would  urge  Congress  to  consider  that  the  issues  rel-
evant  for  fixing  the  system,  in  fact,  highlight  that  what  is  wrong 
with  it  today  is  not  the  distributions  that  enable  wireless  to  bring 
the  benefits  called  for  in  the  1996  Act  to  underserved  regions  of 
rural  America.  Most  significant  among  these  are  duplicative  fund-
ing and distributions based on a cost-plus methodology. 

Regarding duplicative funding, the drafters of the 1996 Act knew 
the  size  of  the  Fund  would  increase  for  disbursements  to  competi-
tors.  They  were  trying  to  encourage  competition  in  order  to  lower 
prices  and  increase  service  quality  for  consumers.  What  they  did 
not anticipate was that existing carriers would not lose funding for 
lines  they  no  longer  had  to  maintain,  lines  for  customers  that  de-
cide  to  use  a  competitor’s  services.  Duplicate  funding  was  actually 
slated  for  elimination  by  the  FCC  years  ago.  Acting  on  it  today 
could save the Fund $300 million per year or more. 

Regarding cost-plus, it is inherently problematic to reward ineffi-
ciency  by  providing  support  on  the  basis  that  the  more  you  spend,

48 

the  more  you  get.  If  we  were  serious  about  reforming  USF,  then 
this reward for inefficiency must be eliminated. 

In  conclusion,  I  believe  there’s  so  much  to  be  lost  by  imple-
menting  the  Joint  Board’s  recommended  cap.  As  a  tangible  result, 
rural  Americans  would  not  gain  the  public  safety,  economic  devel-
opment,  and  other  benefits  of  wireless  service  that  they  need,  de-
serve, and demand. As an intangible result, the Commission would 
have failed to meet the competitive neutrality standard of the 1996 
Act.  We  view  this  as  a  very  important  matter.  We  ask  of  our  gov-
ernment to level the playing field rather than picking winners and 
losers  in  a  free  marketplace.  Only  fair  competition  will  bring  the 
best services at the lowest prices to the most consumers. 

Mr. Vice Chairman and Members of the Committee, I greatly ap-

preciate your time and attention to this matter. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Foxman follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JONATHAN D. FOXMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

CHINOOK WIRELESS 

Chairman Inouye, Ranking Member Stevens, and Members of the Committee, my 
name  is  Jonathan  Foxman  and  I  am  the  President  and  CEO  of  Chinook  Wireless. 
I thank you for this opportunity to be here to discuss the Universal Service system. 
Chinook  Wireless  opposes  the  cap  recommended  by  the  Joint  Board,  and  in  this 
testimony  provides  specific  proposals  for  rapid  and  actual  reform  of  the  Universal 
Service system. 
I. Chinook Wireless—Background 

Our  company  provides  wireless  services  to  customers  throughout  Montana  and 
northern  Wyoming,  and  recently  acquired  licenses  to  also  provide  these  services  in 
central and southern Wyoming and western North Dakota and South Dakota. 

We  are  a  fully  capable  wireless  communications  company  with  our  own  network 
of  cell  sites  and  switching  core,  call  center,  and  retail  stores,  all  in  Montana  and 
Wyoming, representing a variety of high quality jobs in the markets we serve. Over 
the last 2 years, we have made a significant investment to upgrade and greatly ex-
pand our network and systems to bring state-of-the-art wireless voice and data com-
munications  to  much  of  Montana.  We  now  provide  broadband  wireless  voice  and 
data, including access to the Internet. We believe we are answering the urgent need 
for better telecommunications services and public safety in rural America. With Uni-
versal  Service  support,  we  could  do  so  much  more  to  answer  what  is  truly  a  des-
perate need. 

The fundamental limitation to addressing this need is that the high cost of deploy-
ing cell sites in these areas, while so important for public safety and other reasons, 
cannot be paid back by merely a handful of customers. 
II.  Universal  Service  Funds  Are  Critical  for  Extending  Wireless  Service  to 

Rural Areas 

To date, unlike any wireline carrier we know, we have built our business in rural 
America without subsidies of any kind. We have built our business entirely with pri-
vate  investment  and  loans.  We  do  not  have  a  guaranteed  rate  of  return,  we  have 
not received government funding, and we do not have an embedded subscriber base. 
As  a  result,  we  are  what  I  would  term,  ‘‘business  case  limited’’.  We  have  to  build 
and operate as efficiently as possible. Our lenders and investors set very finite lim-
its, and they will not fund infrastructure without a business case to support it. This 
constrains how much coverage we can provide in rural and remote areas where the 
need  is  greatest.  Yet,  citizens  who  live  in  and  travel  through  these  areas  both  de-
serve and demand wireless service, particularly for public safety purposes. We have 
had  people  beg  us  to  build  cell  sites  on  their  farms  so  they  can  have  decent  phone 
service.  We  have  also  had  people  tell  us  that  they  cannot  understand  why  there  is 
no  wireless  service  on  some  of  the  highways  they  frequently  travel.  We  want  to 
serve  these  customers.  We  recognize  the  need,  but  we  simply  cannot  meet  it  with 
private  funding  alone.  Therefore,  we  have  asked  the  Montana  Public  Utility  Com-
mission  for  authority  to  be  eligible  for  Universal  Service  Fund  (USF)  support.  This 
support would greatly expand our company’s ability to build systems to serve areas

49 

that we otherwise could not reach. We urge Congress and continue to urge the FCC 
to recognize that there is a critical need in rural America for improved telecommuni-
cations services, particularly the public safety benefits that only wireless service can 
provide. 
III.  The  Recommended  Cap  Would  Inhibit  Competition,  Contravene  the 
Intent of Drafters of the 1996 Act, And Would Not Repair Actual Flaws 
in the Universal Service System 

A.  Capping  Funds  Only  to  Competitive  Providers  Impairs  the  Competitive  Benefits 

For Consumers Envisioned By Drafters of the 1996 Act 

We  strongly  oppose  the  Universal  Service  cap  recommended  by  the  Joint  Board. 
This  proposal  would  limit  funding  for  ‘‘competitive  carriers’’  (CETCs),  a  group  that 
includes  all  wireless  providers  in  the  Universal  Service  system,  but  not  incumbent 
landline carriers in the same rural areas. Any action taken should be balanced and 
applied  equitably  to  all  carriers,  the  older  incumbents  as  well  as  their  newer  com-
petitors. 

Among  ‘‘the  four  critical  goals  set  forth  for  the  new  Universal  Service  program’’ 
the  FCC  identified  in  implementing  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996,  was  the 
goal  ‘‘that  the  benefits  of  competition  be  brought  to  as  many  consumers  as  pos-
sible.’’ 1 The  cap  proposed  by  the  Joint  Board  in  the  Recommended  Decision  would 
directly  conflict  with  this  goal  of  bringing  the  benefits  of  competition  to  consumers. 
That  would  be  irresponsible.  Where  competition  exists,  it  has  dramatically  driven 
down  service  prices  and  increased  quality  of  service.2 Universal  service  funding  to 
competitors as well as incumbent carriers allows that beneficial competition to take 
place. 
B.  The  1996  Act  Was  Intended  To  Increase  Funding  to  Competitive  Carriers—But 
it Was Also Expected To Result in Reduced Funding to Carriers That Were Less 
Efficient and Lost Customers, Whether They Proved To Be Incumbents Or Newer 
Carriers 

We  understand  the  alarm  over  increases  in  the  Fund,  but  those  increases  are 
caused  by  permitting  surpluses  and  inefficiencies  to  remain  in  the  program.  In-
creased  payouts  to  competitors  were  foreseen  by  the  drafters  of  the  1996  legisla-
tion.3 Growth  in  the  Fund  was  viewed  as  necessary  in  order  to  bring  new  tech-
nologies  into  rural  America  without  materially  harming  rural  ILECs  in  the  short- 
term.4 What legislators did not anticipate 5 was that after competitors entered rural 
markets,  there  would  be  a  failure  of  will  by  policymakers  to  concomitantly  reduce 
funding  to  carriers  who  lost  customers  or  used  funds  inefficiently.6 We  understand 
that regulatory decisions in these matters cannot be universally popular with all in-
dustry participants, regardless of the choices made—but consumers, not carriers, are 
the intended beneficiaries of Universal Service. 

For the short term at least, we think decreasing phone service rates 7 will ensure 
customer  bills  do  not  increase  overall,  despite  increases  in  the  Fund.8 But  we  are 
concerned  that  imposition  of  the  cap  might  permit  the  Commission  to  again  avoid 
actual  reform  of  the  Universal  Service  system.  So-called  temporary  measures  often 
stretch into years of prolonged renewals.9 

Rather  than  risk  infinite  reduction  of  rural  wireless  services,  we  urge  Congress 
to  strongly  suggest  that  the  Commission  rapidly  and  finally  repair  the  Universal 
Service system, keeping in mind the goals of reducing inefficiencies and facilitating 
true  competition,  as  mandated  by  the  1996  Act.  It  is  crucial  to  level  the  playing 
field,  which  will  improve  prices,  service  quality  and  choice  for  consumers,  rather 
than permitting cuts in funding only for newer market entrants. 

The  FCC  has  scrutinized  Universal  Service  reform  for  years,  repeatedly  request-
ing  comments.  The  proposed  cap  would  only  permit  maintenance  of  this  cycle.  In-
stead, it is time to fix the system. The Commission could adopt meaningful reforms 
within  a  year,  without  using  a  cap  that  would  injure  rural  citizens’  access  to  wire-
less  service.  The  FCC  implemented  spectrum  auctions  within  a  year,  and  drafted 
and  released  its  Local  Competition  Orders  under  the  1996  Act  within  a  single  year 
as well. This is no different—just another complex undertaking that the agency cer-
tainly does have the institutional expertise and resources to accomplish. 
IV. Actual Flaws Should Be Repaired, In Order To Reduce Fund Size More 

Equitably 

A. Solve the ‘‘Cost-Plus’’ Problem 

Today, some carriers receive support on a ‘‘the more you spend, the more you get’’ 
basis, termed ‘‘cost plus.’’ There is no scrutiny of whether expenditures are efficient 
or appropriate. In addition, the current system guarantees a comfortable rate of re-
turn. These factors are incentives to inefficiency, motivating more spending on over-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:14 May 07, 2012 Jkt 074012 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74012.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

50 

head  and  marketing,  rather  than  finding  the  most  efficient  method  of  delivering 
service to a customer. 

If  the  FCC  would  modify  or  eliminate  ‘‘cost  plus’’  support,  that  will  reduce  the 
Fund’s size and free up resources that instead can be invested in broadband or other 
technologies—because competition will help discourage inefficiencies that regulators 
cannot  effectively  excise.  States  including  Montana  do  not  allow  CETCs  to  serve 
only  low-cost  areas.  Therefore,  we  must  be  efficient  in  building  and  operating  our 
network.  Support  for  all  carriers  should  be  based  on  the  cost  of  providing  an  effi-
cient network, in order that any carrier that wants to make additional expenditures 
will do so only out of its own pocket, not the public purse. 
B. Make Support Fully Portable 

Portable  support  means  support  funds  that  travel  with  a  customer:  the  carrier 
that  retains  a  customer,  receives  the  support  for  serving  that  customer’s  line.  And 
logically, when a carrier loses a customer, the support should stop arriving. This ap-
proach was upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Alenco Com-
munications, Inc. v. FCC: 

. . .  [T]he  [FCC’s  Universal  Service]  order  provides  that  the  Universal  Service 
subsidy  be  portable  so  that  it  moves  with  the  customer,  rather  than  stay  with 
the incumbent LEC . . . The purpose of Universal Service is to benefit the cus-
tomer,  not  the  carrier.  ‘‘Sufficient’’  funding  of  the  customer’s  right  to  adequate 
telephone service can be achieved regardless of which carrier ultimately receives 
the subsidy.10 

Yet,  inexplicably,  this  course  was  reversed  and  now,  the  cost  of  USF  subsidies 
that  are  still  being  paid  to  wireline  carriers  for  customers  those  carriers  have  lost 
(lines  that  were  built  long  ago  and  paid  for  many  times  over)  is  over  $300  million 
per  year.  Wireless  carriers,  in  contrast,  lose  support  when  we  lose  customers.  The 
Commission  can  reduce  waste  in  the  system  by  requiring  that  a  carrier  no  longer 
serving  a  customer  give  up  its  claim  to  funds  initially  relating  to  that  connection. 
V. Conclusion: Competition Is Encouraging a Beneficial Paradigm Shift 

In  the  broader  perspective,  a  nationwide  paradigm  shift  is  taking  place—a  shift 
toward  consumer  desire  for  the  benefits  of  competition:  lower  prices,  higher  quality 
service,  and  more  options.  Some  markets  are  already  supporting  multiple,  often 
complimentary,  communications  technologies.  To  the  extent  government  chooses  to 
aid  extension  of  these  technologies  to  the  ‘‘last  mile,’’  all  services  should  be  placed 
on  an  equal  footing,  and  all  market  participants  should  receive  equal  support  per 
customer,  based  on  the  costs  of  building  an  efficient  network  in  a  particular  area. 
The  FCC  reached  these  conclusions  between  1996  and  2001,  and  they  remain  valid 
today. 

Universal  Service  improvements  should  be  consistent  with  the  core  principles  of 
the  1996  Act:  that  all  Americans  deserve  the  benefits  of  competition,  and  support 
should  work  with  competition,  rather  than  hamper  the  success  of  a  free  market. 
Support  should  be  distributed  efficiently,  freeing  up  funds  for  investments  in 
broadband. 

Government’s  role  is  not  choosing  winners  in  the  world  of  business.  Instead,  a 
level playing field can support competition for the benefit of consumers. The current 
focus  on  new  entrants  simply  distracts  attention  from  true  issues  threatening  the 
future of USF. 

I  urge  Congress  to  oppose  this  inequitable  cap  on  funds  for  competitive  carriers. 
Instead, Chinook Wireless supports rapid and diligent reform of the underlying sys-
tem, in order that the goals Congress enacted in 1996 may finally be realized. Com-
petition can coexist with a policy of supporting service to underserved areas. By en-
couraging a level playing field and efficiencies in the use of funding, regulators can 
curb Fund growth while providing consumers with the benefits of Universal Service 
and competition.

2 As  an  example  of  consumer  benefits  from  competition:  consider  the  wireless  in-
dustry, which became highly competitive after the introduction of spectrum auctions 
in 1996. From 1995—2005, the average cost per minute for wireless service dropped 
from  43  cents/minute  to  7  cents/minute.  See  Implementation  of  Section  6002(b)  of

7.8  cents/minute,  as  compared  to  the  43  cents  of  10  years  earlier.  In  other  words, 
even  including  customers’  contributions  to  the  Universal  Service  Fund,  competitive 
forces  have  driven  down  the  total  amounts  they  pay  for  wireless  service,  even  as 
those customers make more and longer calls, increasing 119 to 740 average wireless 
minutes per month over the same 10-year period. Id. 

3 If  concern  over  Fund  size  relates  to  carrier  receipts,  consider  the  fact  that 
wireline  carriers  still  receive  an  enormous  share  of  Universal  Service  funding.  In 
the State of Montana, in 2006, according to the Joint Board, incumbent wireline car-
riers received $69.7 million in funding, and competitive carriers such as wireless re-
ceived  $7.2  million  in  funding.  See  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service, 
Universal Service Monitoring Report, Table 7.2 (2006), attached hereto (‘‘Monitoring 
Report  Attachment’’).  Incumbent  wireline  carriers  still  receive  more  than  three 
times  as  much  funding  as  their  wireless  and  wireline  competitors,  and  in  some 
states, they receive 100 percent of Universal Service funding. 

4 In fact, the FCC adopted a five-year transition period during which rural ILECs 
would not lose support when CETCs entered. See Federal-State Joint Board on Uni-
versal  Service,  Fourteenth  Report  and  Order,  Twenty-second  Order  on  Reconsider-
ation,  and  Further  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking,  16  FCC  Rcd  11244,  11294–95 
(2001). 

5 Joint  Board  Member  Billy  Jack  Gregg,  in  testimony  before  the  Communications 
Subcommittee  of  this  Committee,  described  legislative  intent  and  expectations  in 
1996 as follows: 

It  should  not  be  surprising  that  funding  for  competitive  ETCs  has  increased. 
After  all,  before  the  advent  of  competition  incumbents  received  100  percent  of 
high-cost  funding.  It  was  expected  that  as  competitors  gained  ETC  status  and 
won  customers  in  high-cost  areas,  their  high-cost  funding  would  rise.  What  is 
surprising  is  that  incumbent  support  has  not  dropped  by  an  amount  propor-
tionate to the increase in competitive ETC funding. . . . 
Not  only  was  the  introduction  of  competition  expected  to  lower  prices  of  tele-
communications services, it was supposed to lower the cost of Universal Service 
as providers competed for the Universal Service subsidy. 

Testimony  of  Billy  Jack  Gregg  before  Communications  Subcommittee,  Senate 
Commerce,  Science  and  Transportation  Committee,  at  6–7  (March  1,  2007),  ref-
erencing  House  Report  No.  104–204  (I)  (1995),  Arnold  &  Porter  Legislative  History 
Pub. L. 104–104 (A&P) at 60; Senate Report No. 104–23, A&P at 254 (1995). 

6 In 2006, the FCC extended indefinitely the transition period during which rural 
ILECs  would  not  lose  support,  without  enacting  any  reforms.  Federal-State  Joint 
Board on Universal Service, Order, 21 FCC Red 5514 (2006). 

7 Consumer  Price  Index  data  shows  that  telephone  service  costs  are  decreasing 
compared  to  other  services,  From  1995  through  2005,  the  annual  rate  of  change  in 
the  Consumer  Price  Index  (‘‘CPI’’)  for  all  goods  and  services  was  2.5  percent,  while 
the annual rate of change for all telephone services was ¥0.2 percent. In 2005, CPI 
for all goods and services rose 3.4 percent, while the increase for all telephone serv-
ices was only 0.4 percent. See Monitoring Report Attachment. 

8 The  Joint  Board  decision  did  not  cite  any  evidence  that  consumers  would  be 
harmed absent a cap. And we believe any increase in customer bills from increasing 
contributions  will  be  offset  by  declining  rates.  According  to  FCC  analysis,  average 
monthly  rates  for  wireline  and  wireless  services  have  decreased,  for  wireless  as 
much as 20 percent to 30 percent per year, even when the Universal Service charge 
is  taken  into  account.  Average  monthly  combined  charges  for  local  and  interstate/ 
international  long  distance  telephone  service,  approximately  $42  in  1995,  declined 
to  approximately  $28  in  2004  (the  most  recent  year  for  which  average  bills  can  be 
calculated).  FCC,  Trends  in  Telephone  Service,  Table  3.3  (Feb.  2007)  (‘‘Trends  Re-
port’’).  Average  monthly  charges  for  residential  local  service  taken  from  Trends  Re-
port  at  Table  13.3.  Average  monthly  charges  for  residential  interstate/international 
long distance service calculated by multiplying average revenue per minute by aver-
age  monthly  interstate  and  international  long  distance  minutes  for  the  same  year. 
See  Trends  Report  at  Tables  13.4,  14.2.  Wireless  prices  (reflected  by  average  cost 
per  minute)  have  dropped  as  much  as  20  percent  to  30  percent  per  year  between 
1998  and  2005.  The  overall  decline  in  revenues  per  minute  for  wireless  services 
from  1993  through  2005  was  84.1  percent.  Average  wireless  service  monthly  bills 
fell  by  18.7  percent  from  1993–2005.  See  Implementation  of  Section  6002(b)  of  the

Senator STEVENS. Thank you, Mr. Foxman. 
Our next witness is Mr. Joel Lubin. 
Mr. Lubin? 

STATEMENT OF JOEL E. LUBIN, VICE PRESIDENT, 

REGULATORY PLANNING AND POLICY, AT&T SERVICES, INC. 
Mr. LUBIN. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman 
and  Members  of  the  Committee,  for  inviting  us  this  morning  to 
speak on this panel. 

AT&T is a long-term supporter of national Universal Service pol-

icy. We thank you for your leadership. 

AT&T is the single largest provider of telephone service in rural 
America. We serve more than 7 million lines in rural America, ap-
proximately  one-third  of  the  Nation’s  rural  lines.  Other  carriers 
have divested their high-cost lines or declined to serve rural areas. 
We,  however,  have  committed  to  serve  all  customers,  wherever 
they  live.  With  proper  support,  this  commitment  could  and  should 
include  the  deployment  of  next-generation  services.  But,  as  AT&T 
and  other  carriers  across  America  have  experienced  firsthand,  in-
sufficient  and  unstable  Universal  Service  funding  not  only  threat-
ens  the  continued  quality  of  today’s  legacy  services,  it  also  is  a 
major deterrent to investment in advanced broadband facilities and 
services. 

The  current  Universal  Service  high-cost  system  is  broken  and 
badly  needs  reform.  For  this  reason,  we  support  both  the  short- 
term  recommendations  and  the  long-term  goals  contained  in  the 
Federal-State  Joint  Board  Recommended  Decision.  High-cost  fund-
ing  has  reached  an  annual  high  water  mark  of  $4  billion,  and  is 
already  racing  to  exceed  that  level.  As  the  high-cost  fund  has  ca-
reened out of control, it has become increasingly impossible to con-
sider,  much  less  implement,  long  overdue  reform  measures.  The 
Joint  Board  proposes  to  rein  in  the  explosive  growth  by  imposing 
an  interim  emergency  cap  on  support  of  competitive  eligible  tele-
communication  carriers,  CETCs.  The  Board’s  interim  solution  pro-
vides  a  temporary  and  tailored  reform  measure  that  should  bring 
needed  discipline  to  the  Fund.  Today,  competitive  ETCs  received 
almost  $1  billion  in  2006.  Five  years  ago,  it  was  $15  million.  And 
at this point, the funding is not targeted to underserved areas. I’m 
going  to  repeat  that  point.  The  targeting  today  is  not  targeted  to 
undeserved  areas.  Consumers  are,  in  many  cases,  footing  the  bills 
to  subsidize  multiple  competitive  ETCs  vying  for  the  same  cus-
tomers  in  the  same  neighborhoods,  and  often  as  many  as  three  or 
four  wireless  ETC  lines  in  the  same  household.  Because  high-cost 
support  to  competitive  ETCs  is  expected  to  increase  to  $2  billion 
next year, $2.5 billion in 2009, an interim cap is important to pre-
vent further increases due to current rules. 

We  support  this  measure,  even  though  there  will  be  some  ad-
verse  impacts.  Many  carriers,  including  AT&T,  our  wireless  enter-
prise,  will  be  required  to  shoulder  at  least  a  short-term  reduction 
in  otherwise  certain  funds.  In  light  of  this,  we  have  provided  spe-
cific  comments  to  the  FCC  on  ways  to  minimize  disruptions  to  ex-
isting  carrier  investment  plans.  Let’s  not  forget,  there  will  be 
money,  still,  the  following  year,  that  still  could  be  used  for  cell 
sites.

In the end, however, the short-term challenge is a small price to 
pay  for  immediate  Fund  stabilization  and  headroom  to  engage  in 
reasoned  exploration  of  comprehensive  reform,  including  the  right 
way  to  promote  broadband  deployment  and  wireless  coverage  in 
rural,  underserved  areas  without  overburdening  an  already  over-
burdened  system.  AT&T  would  like  to  share  with  you  its  vision  of 
Universal Service reform, for if we don’t move to a long-term solu-
tion, we’ve not really accomplished much. 

The second aspect of the Joint Board’s recommendation is looking 
at  long-term  solutions.  In  addition  to  the  interim  cap  on  competi-
tive  ETC  funding,  comprehensive  reform  must  embrace  the  fol-
lowing three elements: 

Number one, replacement of the existing revenue-based contribu-
tion  mechanism  with  a  telephone-numbers  connections-based  solu-
tion. 

Number  two,  reform  intercarrier  compensation  to  preserve  Uni-
versal  Service  during  the  transition  to  a  fully  deployed  broadband 
environment.  Let  me  be  very  clear  on  this  point.  When  broadband 
gets  fully  deployed,  the  current  access  charges  vaporize.  They  go 
away. This needs to be addressed. 

Number  three,  reform  of  existing  Federal  high-cost  funding 
mechanism  to  promote  deployment  of  next-generation  broadband 
and  expanded  and  improved  wireless  service  in  rural  areas.  Let’s 
focus  on  the  third  element.  We  specifically  propose  that  the  FCC 
make  available  funding  in  a  pilot  program  designed  to  support  de-
ployment  of  lower-cost  higher-speed  broadband  alternatives  in  un-
derserved  rural  areas.  Similarly,  the  FCC  should  identify  areas 
that currently lack reliable mobile wireless service. Each pilot pro-
gram that we suggested should be addressed by and created by the 
Commission,  a  single  provider  would  be  eligible  to  obtain  funding 
within  a  specific  geographic  area  in  order  to  provide  service  to  the 
underserved  areas.  Such  pilot  programs  would  provide  the  FCC 
much-needed  experience  and  information  about  funding  levels  and 
other  issues  that  will  enable  the  Commission  to  craft  the  right  in-
centives to support deployment to underserved areas. 

Thank you. And I look forward to your questions. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Lubin follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOEL E. LUBIN, VICE PRESIDENT, REGULATORY PLANNING 

AND POLICY, AT&T SERVICES, INC. 

Good  morning.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  and  mem-
bers  of  the  Committee  for  inviting  me  here  today.  AT&T  is  a  long-time  supporter 
of our national policy of Universal Service and of recent efforts to sustain that policy 
through  meaningful  reform.  In  this  regard,  we  salute  the  leadership  of  Chairman 
Inouye, Vice Chairman Stevens, and the work of the entire Committee. 

AT&T  is  the  single  largest  provider  of  telephone  service  to  rural  America.  We 
serve more than seven million rural access lines, nearly one-third of the rural lines 
in  the  Nation.  At  the  same  time,  AT&T  receives  a  disproportionately  lower  share 
of high-cost funding to provide this service. Under similar conditions, other carriers 
have divested their high-cost lines, or declined to serve rural areas. AT&T, however, 
remains committed to serve all customers, wherever they live. With proper support, 
this  commitment  could—and  should—include  the  deployment  of  next-generation 
services.  But  as  AT&T  and  other  carriers  across  America  have  experienced  first-
hand,  insufficient  and  unstable  Universal  Service  funding  not  only  threatens  the 
continued  quality  of  today’s  legacy  services;  it  also  is  a  major  deterrent  to  invest-
ment in advanced, broadband facilities and services.

The current Universal Service high-cost support system is broken and badly needs 
reform.  For  this  reason,  we  support  both  the  short  term  recommendations  and  the 
long term goals contained in the Federal-State Joint Board Recommended Decision. 
High-cost funding has increased 54 percent in the last 5 years—and is already rac-
ing  to  exceed  that  level.  As  the  high-cost  fund  has  careened  out  of  control,  it  has 
become  increasingly  impossible  to  consider,  much  less  implement,  long-overdue  re-
form measures. The Joint Board proposes to rein in the explosive growth by impos-
ing  an  interim,  emergency  cap  on  support  to  competitive  Eligible  Telecommuni-
cations Carriers (‘‘ETCs’’). 

The  Board’s  interim  solution  provides  a  temporary  and  tailored  reform  measure 
that  should  bring  needed  discipline  to  the  fund.  In  the  past  5  years,  funding  for 
competitive  ETCs  has  increased  sixty-seven  fold  from  $15  million  (roughly  .5  per-
cent  of  the  overall  Fund)  to  $1  billion  (25  percent  of  the  overall  Fund).  And  this 
funding  is  not  targeted  to  underserved  areas:  consumers  are  in  many  cases  footing 
the bill to subsidize multiple competitive ETCs vying for the same customers in the 
same  neighborhoods  and  often  as  many  as  three  or  even  four  wireless  ETC  lines  in 
the  same  household.  Because  high-cost  support  to  competitive  ETCs  is  expected  to 
increase  to  $2  billion  next  year,  an  interim  cap  is  necessary  to  prevent  further  in-
creases due to the designation of additional competitive ETCs as well as line growth 
among current ETCs. 

We  support  this  measure  even  though  there  will  be  some  adverse  impacts.  Many 
carriers,  including  AT&T,  will  be  required  to  shoulder  at  least  a  short-term  reduc-
tion  in  otherwise  certain  funding.  In  light  of  this,  we  have  provided  specific  com-
ments  to  the  FCC  on  ways  to  minimize  disruptions  to  existing  carrier  investment 
plans. In the end, however, this short-term challenge is a small price to pay for im-
mediate  Fund  stabilization  and  the  breathing  space  to  engage  in  reasoned  explo-
ration  of  comprehensive  reform,  including  the  right  way  to  promote  broadband  de-
ployment  and  wireless  coverage  in  rural  underserved  areas  without  overburdening 
an already overburdened system. 

AT&T would like to share with you its vision of Universal Service reform, the sec-
ond  aspect  of  the  Joint  Board’s  Recommended  Decision.  In  addition  to  the  interim 
cap on competitive ETC funding, comprehensive reform must embrace the following 
elements: 

1.  Replacement  of  the  existing  revenues-based  contribution  mechanism  with  a 
telephone numbers/connections based mechanism. 
2. Reform of intercarrier compensation to preserve Universal Service during the 
transition  to  a  fully  deployed  broadband  environment.  Let  me  be  very  clear  on 
this  point.  When  broadband  gets  fully  deployed  current  access  charges  vaporize. 
They go away. This needs to be addressed. 
3. Reform of the existing Federal high-cost funding mechanisms to promote de-
ployment  of  next-generation  broadband,  and  expanded  and  improved  wireless 
service, in rural areas. 

Let’s  focus  on  this  third  element.  We  specifically  propose  that  the  FCC  make 
available  funding  in  a  pilot  program  designed  to  support  deployment  of  lower-cost, 
higher-speed broadband alternatives in underserved rural areas. Similarly, the FCC 
should  identify  areas  that  currently  lack  reliable,  mobile  wireless  services.  In  each 
pilot program created by the Commission, a single provider would be eligible to ob-
tain funding within a specific geographic area in order to build new facilities to pro-
vide service to underserved populations. Such pilot programs would provide the FCC 
much needed experience and information about funding levels and other issues that 
will  enable  the  Commission  to  craft  the  right  incentives  to  support  deployment  to 
underserved areas. 

Finally,  policymakers  should  not  be  enticed  by  seemingly  easy  solutions.  For  in-
stance,  there  has  been  much  attention  placed  on  the  so-called  ‘‘identical  support’’ 
rule,  which  allows  all  competitive  ETCs  to  receive  the  same  per-line  support  in  a 
particular  study  area  that  the  ILEC  receives,  regardless  of  their  own  costs,  service 
territory or circumstances. We agree that this rule is not in the public interest, but 
the  problem  cannot  be  addressed  by  modifying  this  rule  alone,  as  the  root  of  the 
problem  runs  deeper.  Rather,  the  problem  is  that  the  rules  fail  to  identity  rural 
areas  where  the  support  is  most  needed  to  preserve  Universal  Service.  The  result 
is that many rural areas receive no funding at all, and other areas that are not par-
ticularly rural or high cost receive significant support. 

The  identical  support  rule  exacerbates  this  problem  by  allowing  all  ETCs  that 
serve a given area to receive the same support that is poorly distributed in the first 
instance.  Thus,  the  only  places  a  competitive  ETC  can  receive  support  are  where 
the  underlying  incumbent  LEC  is  already  supported,  regardless  of  the  competitors’

costs  and  build-out  plans.  But  simply  changing  the  identical  support  rule  without 
addressing the fundamental problem of the poorly targeted support is a mistake. It 
may change the incentives facing competitive carriers interested in becoming ETCs, 
but  it  will  not  advance  Universal  Service  goals  for  the  consumers  in  rural  areas. 
There are four big questions that need to be answered in order to develop a robust 
Universal  Service  policy:  what  areas  need  to  be  supported;  what  services  do  you 
want to support; who are you going to pay to deliver those services; and how much 
are you willing to pay? The identical support rule goes to the fourth and final ques-
tion.  Addressing  it  in  isolation  will  virtually  guarantee  that  the  funds  are  not  sent 
to the areas most in need. 

Thank you and I look forward to your questions. 

Senator STEVENS. Thank you, Mr. Lubin. 
The  last  witness  is  Mr.  Everett  B.  Flannery,  Chief  Deputy  of 

Kennebec County. 

STATEMENT  OF  EVERETT  B.  FLANNERY,  JR.,  CHIEF  DEPUTY, 
SHERIFF’S  OFFICE,  KENNEBEC  COUNTY,  STATE  OF  MAINE; 
REPRESENTATIVE, MAINE SHERIFFS’ ASSOCIATION 
Mr. FLANNERY. Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman. 
Mr.  Vice  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I’m  Everett 
B. Flannery, Jr., the retired Sheriff for Kennebec County. I’ve been 
a law enforcement officer in the State of Maine for almost 30 years, 
currently  acting  as  Chief  Deputy  for  Kennebec  County—and  that’s 
a story, upon itself, which I can tell you later. 

The  Maine  Sheriffs’  Association  has  designated  me  as  their 
spokesman  to  provide  you  with  a  rural  public  safety  official’s  per-
spective  on  the  importance  of  continuing,  and,  if  possible,  expand-
ing,  Universal  Service  Fund  support  for  the  build-out  of  our  Na-
tion’s wireless network into the many poorly served areas of Maine. 
My  message  is  very  simple:  although  wireless  service  appears  to 
be  outstanding  in  the  urban  and  suburban  portions  of  our  Nation, 
there are many rural areas of the State of Maine that suffer great-
ly from the lack of quality wireless service. In fact, there are many 
communities that have no wireless service at all. I understand that 
this  problem  is  common  in  other  rural  communities  in  the  United 
States, as well. 

All  of  us  who  live  and  work  in  rural  Maine  struggle  with  the 
problem  of  inadequate  wireless  service.  For  example,  I  have  no 
wireless  service  at  my  home  in  Clinton,  Maine.  Also,  I  understand 
from members of her staff that the Senator from Maine serving on 
this Committee has frequent difficulty staying in touch with her of-
fice  and  her  constituents  as  she  travels  about  the  State  of  Maine. 
The absence of good wireless service prevents those of us respon-
sible  for  public  safety  in  America’s  rural  areas  from  doing  our  job 
properly.  Poor  wireless  service  exposes  both  rural  law  enforcement 
officers  and  the  public  to  unreasonable  health  and  safety  risks. 
Poor  mobile  service  makes  it  less  likely  that  citizens  will  be  able 
to  give  timely  notification  to  public  officials  of  an  emergency, 
whether  it  is  a  car  crash,  an  accident  in  a  logging  operation,  a 
hunting  mishap,  an  ATV  or  snowmobile  accident,  or  any  other 
emergency that needs to be reported. 

The  nonavailability  of  wireless  service  represents  a  danger  both 
for  public  safety  officials  and  the  public  alike.  For  example,  when 
our dispatch center receives a 9-1-1 domestic violence call, the dep-
uty assigned will call into dispatch and be connected directly to the

caller.  Deputies  are  trained  to  use  their  cell  phones  to  call  ahead 
to  determine  what’s  going  on  and  whether  the  deputy  should  call 
for assistance or not, looking for answers like, ‘‘Has someone made 
a threat? Are drugs or alcohol involved? Are children present? Does 
someone have a weapon?’’ Oftentimes, just speaking with a deputy 
will  calm  the  situation  down.  However,  poor  cell  service  in  Ken-
nebec  County  means  that  the  deputy  will  often  be  unable  to  get 
through to the residents. As someone who has handled rural patrol 
duties,  I  can  assure  you  that  you  would  really  prefer  to  know 
whether  someone  inside  the  residence  has  a  gun  before  you 
knocked on the door. 

Bad  as  this—excuse  me—as  bad  as  this  is,  I  get  even  more  con-
cerned  when  I  consider  our  readiness  to  manage  a  disaster  like 
September  11  or  a  Hurricane  Katrina.  Maine’s  public  safety  offi-
cials  are  trained,  equipped,  and  staffed  to  handle  major  incidents, 
but  the  absence  of  quality  mobile  service  to  enable  the  public  to 
communicate with us, and we with them, leads us to conclude that 
we may not be able to deliver the services that people need and de-
serve in such situations. 

I  urge  you  to  review  the  White  Paper  included  as  an  exhibit  to 
my  testimony  which  documents  the  critical  role  played  by  a  USF- 
supported wireless carrier in the recovery from Hurricane Katrina. 
The  white  paper  explains  that  the  FCC  funded  the  distribution  of 
thousands  of  mobile  phones  to  Katrina  victims.  Why?  Because,  in 
the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  storm,  the  Universal  Service-sup-
ported wireless carrier had the only operating communications sys-
tem  on  the  Gulf  Coast  of  Mississippi.  If  we,  in  rural  Maine,  were 
to  be  hit  with  such  a  disaster  of  this  magnitude,  I  feel  that  we 
would have no means of communication at all. 

In  Maine,  the  level  of  support  going  to  rural  wireless  carriers 
from the Universal Service Fund will determine our ability to cope 
with  a  disastrous  situation.  Maine’s  public  safety  officials  cannot 
understand  why  the  Federal  Government  would  consider  capping 
rural  wireless  expansion  funding  just  as  it  is  beginning  to  achieve 
the results intended by the Congress in its landmark Telecommuni-
cations  Act  of  1996.  Avoiding  a  cap  on  wireless  Universal  Service 
funding is a very important issue for Maine. That is why our entire 
Congressional  delegation  has  gone  on  record  opposing  the  cap  in 
the letters filed with the FCC. Also, earlier this month, the legisla-
ture of the State of Maine enacted a joint resolution memorializing 
Congress and the FCC in opposition to this cap. As this illustrates, 
achieving  improved  wireless  service  for  our  State  is  a  thoroughly 
bipartisan effort. 

In closing, I want to extend my thanks to the Committee and its 
staff for providing me with the opportunity to share the perspective 
of  Maine’s  rural  public  safety  officials  with  you  at  this  hearing.  I 
especially want to thank Senator Snowe and her excellent staff for 
their assistance in connection with my appearance here today. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF EVERETT B.  FLANNERY,  JR.,  CHIEF DEPUTY,  SHERIFF’S 
OFFICE,  KENNEBEC COUNTY,  STATE OF MAINE;  REPRESENTATIVE,  MAINE 
SHERIFFS’ ASSOCIATION 
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am Everett B. Flannery, Jr., and 
I  am  a  career  law  enforcement  officer  in  Kennebec  County,  a  largely  rural  portion 
of the State of Maine. Currently, I serve as the Chief Deputy Sheriff for the County. 
I was the elected Sheriff of Kennebec County from October 5, 2001 to December 31, 
2006,  but  I  stepped  down  in  January  of  this  year  in  order  to  shift  my  focus  from 
management and administration of the Sheriff’s Office to computer forensics and in-
formation technology. My re´sume´ is attached as Exhibit 1 to this Testimony. 

I  am  here  today  both  in  my  own  capacity  and  as  a  representative  of  the  Maine 
Sheriffs’  Association  (‘‘MSA’’).  The  Maine  Sheriffs  have  designated  me  as  their 
spokesman to provide you with a rural public safety official’s perspective on the im-
portance  of  continuing  and,  if  possible,  expanding,  Universal  Service  Fund  (‘‘USF’’) 
support  for  the  build-out  of  our  Nation’s  wireless  network  into  the  many  poorly 
served, rural areas of the United States. On Friday of this week, the MSA will take 
up a Resolution formally opposing the cap on competitive ETC funding proposed by 
the  Federal  State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service.  A  draft  of  this  Resolution  is 
attached  as  Exhibit  2.  I  am  confident  that  it  will  be  adopted,  and  I  ask  permission 
to supplement the record with the final version of the Resolution, as adopted. 

My  message  is  very  simple:  although  wireless  service  appears  to  be  outstanding 
in  the  urban  and  suburban  portions  of  our  Nation,  there  are  many  rural  areas  of 
the  State  of  Maine  that  suffer  greatly  from  the  lack  of  quality  wireless  service.  In 
fact,  there  are  many  communities  in  Maine  that  have  no  wireless  service  at  all.  I 
understand  that  this  problem  is  common  in  other  rural  communities  in  the  United 
States. 

The  ‘‘Wireless  Gap’’  between  urban  and  rural  America  was  not  supposed  to  hap-
pen.  As  I  understand  it,  the  1996  Telecom  Act  set  up  the  Universal  Service  Fund 
to ensure that telecommunications services in rural and urban areas would be ‘‘rea-
sonably  comparable’’  in  terms  of  price  and  service  availability.  Adequate  support 
from  the  USF  remains  the  key  to  closing  the  Wireless  Gap  in  America.  Until  the 
Gap has been closed, those of us living in the rural areas of the United States have 
a  right  to  expect,  and  do  expect,  that  Universal  Service  Fund  will  continue  to  pro-
vide support for rural wireless service. 

The  absence  of  good  wireless  service  prevents  those  of  us  responsible  for  public 
safety  in  America’s  rural  areas  from  doing  our  job  properly.  For  reasons  I  will  ex-
plain  later,  poor  wireless  service  exposes  both  rural  law  enforcement  officials  and 
the public to unreasonable health and safety risks and greatly compromises the pub-
lic safety community’s ability to carry out our homeland security duties in the event 
of a natural or man-made disaster. I will also explain why this condition stifles any 
hope of much-needed economic development in rural areas. 

Right  now,  our  only  hope  of  correcting  this  terrible  situation  rests  on  continued 
and,  if  possible,  expanded  support  from  the  Universal  Service  Fund  for  rural  wire-
less expansion. We in rural Maine cannot understand why the Federal Government 
would  consider  capping  rural  wireless  expansion  funding  just  as  it  is  beginning  to 
achieve  the  results  intended  by  the  Congress  in  its  landmark  Telecommunications 
Act of 1996. I would hope that the FCC could be convinced of the importance of ex-
panded  rural  wireless  funding.  If  not,  then  I  would  hope  that  Congress  would  take 
action to override the FCC. 

This  is  my  third  trip  to  Washington  as  the  MSA’s  spokesman  on  this  issue.  (On 
my  two  prior  trips  I  met  with  FCC  Commissioners  and  their  staff  and  with  the 
members of Maine’s Congressional delegation and their staff, in each case to discuss 
the  need  for  expanding  USF  support  for  rural  wireless  expansion.)  Whenever  I  am 
in Washington I begin to understand why it might be difficult for some policymakers 
in  this  city  to  appreciate  the  importance  of  rural  wireless  funding  to  those  of  us  in 
Maine.  Here  in  Washington,  I  notice  that  my  mobile  phone  shows  a  strong  signal 
wherever I go. The signal quality remains excellent as I travel around the city and 
I rarely drop a call here. Folks here in Washington do not experience poor wireless 
service, and I am tempted to recommend that the Congress require the FCC to move 
its  offices  to  rural  Maine,  and  require  the  Commissioners  to  live  and  try  to  work 
there,  so  that  they  can  experience  what  we  experience  every  day.  I  am  confident 
that  we  would  enjoy  much  more  reasonable  policy  treatment  should  you  decide  to 
take this step. 

My  point,  of  course,  is  that  wireless  service  where  I  live  and  work  in  Kennebec 
County,  Maine,  is  not  at  all  comparable  to  what  I  find  here  in  Washington.  I  have 
very poor wireless service at my home in Clinton, in the northern part of the Coun-
ty, and service is generally spotty unless you are in the Augusta area (Maine’s cap-

ital)  or  on  one  of  the  County’s  major  roads.  The  smaller  towns  in  the  County,  such 
as  Albion,  Benton,  Mount  Vernon,  Fayette,  Rome,  and  Vassalboro  have  very  poor 
or no service. 

Now let me explain why this presents a serious public safety problem. Poor mobile 
service  makes  it  less  likely  that  citizens  will  be  able  to  give  timely  notification  to 
public  safety  officials  of  an  emergency,  whether  it  is  a  car  crash,  an  accident  in  a 
logging  operation,  a  hunting  mishap,  ATV/snowmobile  accident  or  any  other  emer-
gency that needs to be reported. 

Here’s  a  specific  example.  My  son  is  a  paramedic  in  Somerset  County,  another 
rural area of our State. He is often the first responder, for example, when a logging 
truck with a full load overturns on the highway. His job is to evaluate any injuries 
on the scene, do what he can to stabilize the injured party and transport the injured 
to the hospital in Skowhegan. In many cases, there is no VHF or cell service at the 
accident scene. This means that he has to flag down passing motorists and ask them 
to  drive  to  a  house  with  wireline  service  and  call  for  assistance.  The  alternative  is 
to  climb  a  nearby  hill  and  hope  he  can  catch  a  signal,  leaving  the  injured  in  the 
hands  of  a  single  paramedic.  The  delay  in  arranging  care  and/or  transportation  by 
helicopter can often be life-threatening. 

Poor wireless service also prevents public safety personnel from carrying out their 
day-to-day  responsibilities  in  an  efficient  and  effective  way.  For  example,  the  dis-
patch  center  in  our  office  frequently  gets  9-1-1  calls  regarding  domestic  violence, 
and  a  deputy  in  a  cruiser  will  be  sent  to  the  scene.  Our  deputies  will  call  into  dis-
patch  to  be  connected  directly  to  the  caller.  Often  a  domestic  incident  will  resolve 
itself when the parties involved know that law enforcement will be arriving shortly. 
Also,  during  the  call  the  deputy  tries  to  determine  whether  anyone  at  the  scene 
has  a  weapon,  whether  alcohol  or  drugs  are  involved,  and  whether  children  are  in 
the  house.  This  enables  the  deputy  to  decide  whether  to  arrange  back-up  both  for 
his or her own safety and for the safety of the citizens at the scene. I myself handled 
rural patrol responsibilities such as this earlier in my career, and I can tell you that 
you would really prefer to know before you knock on a strange door whether anyone 
inside the house is armed. 

In the many areas of Kennebec County where mobile service is poor, our deputies 
either  cannot  make  these  calls  at  all,  or  the  calls  are  dropped  frequently.  So,  does 
the  deputy  assume  the  call  was  dropped  or  was  the  phone  ripped  out  of  the  wall? 
The  result  is  a  very  unsafe  condition  both  for  the  citizens  we  are  trying  to  protect 
and for the public safety people who are trained to deliver these vital services. 

Because  modern  digital  technology  is  secure,  we  often  rely  on  cell  phones  in  our 
surveillance  and  undercover  work.  These  very  valuable  tools  are  useless  in  rural 
towns where service is unreliable. 

These  are  just  three  examples  of  the  kinds  of  problems  public  safety  people  in 
Maine  face  every  day  in  our  struggle  with  inferior  wireless  service.  Bad  as  this  is, 
I  get  even  more  concerned  when  I  consider  our  readiness  to  manage  a  disaster  on 
the  scale  of  a  September  11  or  a  Hurricane  Katrina.  We  are  trained,  equipped  and 
staffed to handle major incidents like these, but the absence of quality mobile serv-
ice  to  enable  the  public  to  communicate  with  us  (and  we  with  them),  leads  me  to 
conclude  that  we  may  not  be  able  to  deliver  the  services  that  people  need  in  such 
situations. 

In training scenarios involving natural or man-made disasters we will deploy our 
mobile command post to the area. Often times we must place the command post not 
at  the  best  location  for  the  incident,  but  to  obtain  a  wireless  signal  to  have  access 
to  the  Internet  and  needed  information,  i.e.,  weather  and  wind  conditions,  posting 
emergency public alerts, etc. 

Last  year,  I  participated  in  the  preparation  of  a  White  Paper  covering  the  home-
land  security  aspects  of  Universal  Service  Fund  support  for  rural  wireless  expan-
sion. The White Paper, which is attached as Exhibit 3 to this testimony, focused on 
the impact of Universal Service Fund support for a wireless service provider serving 
the  Gulf  Coast  of  Mississippi.  The  White  Paper  found  that  although  Hurricane 
Katrina  knocked  out  much  of  the  wireline  network  in  this  area  for  several  weeks, 
the  wireless  network,  supported  by  steady  infusions  from  the  Universal  Service 
Find,  proved  remarkably  resilient.  Indeed,  the  FCC,  which  today  seems  poised  to 
limit  funding  for  wireless  carriers,  exercised  its  emergency  authority  over  the  USF 
to  fund  the  distribution  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  free  mobile  phones  to  storm 
victims, since no other means of communication was available in the area. 

The  White  Paper  also  found  that  public  safety  personnel  relied  on  the  wireless 
network  almost  exclusively  in  the  aftermath  of  the  storm  and  for  some  time  there-
after. For example, here is a quote from a dispatcher in the Gulf Coast area: 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:14 May 07, 2012 Jkt 074012 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74012.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

63 

I  work  as  a  dispatcher  for  the  Ocean  Springs  Police  Department.  During  the 
storm  my  Cellular  South  [mobile]  phone  was  the  only  phone  I  could  count  on 
to  be  working  at  all  times.  I  never  lost  a  signal  and  was  able  to  use  the  phone 
as needed. Also, the police officers were able to use the phone to check on family 
and loved ones. 

As  this  shows,  USF  support  for  rural  wireless  build-out  will  not  only  help  public 
safety  officials  in  our  day-to-day  task,  but  will  permit  us  to  deliver  critical  services 
in disaster situations. 

At  a  time  when  we  are  considering  whether  to  implement  an  Emergency  Alert 
System  that  will  enable  us  to  text  message  citizens  with  disaster  reports  or  warn-
ings of imminent weather or other emergencies, it should be obvious that these tools 
will  be  useless  in  areas  where  there  is  poor  cell  service.  Likewise,  for  all  of  the  in-
vestment  that  is  going  into  9-1-1  and  E–911  technologies,  both  at  the  carrier  level 
and  on  the  public  safety  side,  the  lack  of  service  availability  will  make  these  tech-
nologies useless in many rural areas. 

Although my field is public safety, I am also very aware that poor mobile service 
hamstrings  rural  areas  in  our  efforts  to  attract  new  businesses  vitally  needed  to 
counteract  the  departure  of  our  traditional  manufacturing  industries.  I  discussed 
this  frequently  with  Sheriffs  in  other  parts  of  Maine  and  the  story  is  the  same  all 
over:  no  business  wants  to  locate  to  an  area  with  poor  mobile  service.  The  Sheriff 
of  Oxford  County  in  Maine  told  me  a  story  that  makes  this  point  better  than  any-
thing  I  could  say.  He  told  me  that  an  economic  development  official  in  his  County 
was taking a businessman to a location to try to interest him in relocating his busi-
ness.  On  the  way  there,  the  prospect  took  out  his  cell  phone,  noticed  that  he  had 
no service, and asked to be taken right back to the airport. 

Aside from the significant public safety and business development concerns posed 
by poor mobile service, I would hope that the Committee would consider the count-
less daily frustrations that this condition inflicts on the people of rural America. To 
try  to  make  this  point,  I  would  refer  you  to  Exhibit  5  of  United  States  Cellular’s 
Comments  filed  on  the  issue  of  the  cap  with  the  FCC.  (A  copy  of  these  Comments 
were  submitted  to  the  Committee  with  Mr.  Rooney’s  testimony.)  This  Exhibit  con-
sists  of  the  testimony  of  thirty-six  people  from  three  small  Maine  towns:  Bingham, 
Fort  Fairfield,  and  Jonesport.  This  testimony  was  submitted  in  2004  by  United 
States  Cellular  Corporation  to  the  Maine  Public  Utilities  Commission  in  support  of 
its  Eligible  Telecommunications  Carrier  application.  Here  you  will  find  the  stories 
of common, every day rural people struggling to cope with poor mobile service: 

• the mussel farmer who cannot contact his customers while harvesting, 
• the  business  consultant  who  cannot  make  calls  as  he  travels  around  the  State, 
• the shop owner who has to share his store’s phone five times a day with passing 

travelers, 

ers, 

• the  ambulance  service  operator  who  has  trouble  communicating  with  his  driv-

• the operator of a hydro-electric plant who cannot communicate with crew mem-

bers working in dangerous areas away from the office, 

• the  wood  fuel  purchaser  who  cannot  communicate  with  his  power  plant  cus-

tomers or with his truck drivers, 

• the potato farmer who cannot communicate with his wife from his tractor, 
• the  operator  of  a  horse  feed  operation  who  cannot  communicate  with  her  em-

road, 

ployees in satellite facilities, 

• the  hardware  store  owner  who  cannot  call  his  store  or  his  customers  from  the 

• the contractor who cannot call his workers, his customers, his suppliers, or the 

local building inspector from the job site, 

• the  husband  who  worries  when  his  wife,  who  works  the  night  shift  20  miles 
away,  has  to  drive  home  in  the  pitch  dark  of  a  January  night  in  an  ice  storm 
over roads where cell service is unavailable, 

• the fisherman who cannot order a part or call his wife from his boat, 
• the  fisherman’s  wife  who  would  like  to  be  able  to  call  her  husband  when  his 

boat is overdue, or to tell him that the new grandchild has arrived. 

I also understand from members of her staff that a Maine Senator serving on this 
Committee frequently has difficulty in staying in touch with her office and her con-
stituents as she travels around Maine.

I  am  very  pleased  to  say  that  the  Maine  PUC  granted  ETC  status  to  United 
States Cellular, that U.S. Cellular has begun receiving proceeds from the USF, and 
that  with  those  proceeds,  it  has  expanded  its  mobile  network  into  Bingham,  Fort 
Fairfield  and  Jonesport,  Maine,  improving  the  lives  and  livelihood  of  citizens  in 
these  areas.  The  Maine  PUC  has  certified  to  the  FCC  (most  recently  in  October  of 
last year) that U.S. Cellular and Unicel, the only other wireless ETC in Maine, are 
complying with all USF requirements. This shows that USF support for rural wire-
less can really work just as Congress intended. 

But in fact the work is just beginning. We still have many areas in our State that 
the  wireless  infrastructure  does  not  reach,  and  thus  continued  and  expanded  USF 
support  is  imperative  if  we  are  to  create  a  safe  and  modern  environment  to  attract 
business and keep our young people in the State of Maine. 

Avoiding a cap on wireless USF funding is a very important issue for Maine. Illus-
trating  this  is  the  fact  that  our  entire  Congressional  delegation  has  gone  on  record 
opposing  the  cap  in  letters  filed  with  the  FCC.  (These  letters  are  attached  as  Ex-
hibit 4.) Governor Baldacci has likewise written to Senator Snowe urging her to con-
tinue her much appreciated efforts in this regard. Also, earlier this month the Legis-
lature of the State of Maine enacted a Joint Resolution memorializing Congress and 
the  FCC  in  opposition  to  the  cap.  I  have  attached  this  Resolution  as  Exhibit  5  of 
my  testimony,  and  I  have  an  original  of  the  Resolution  here  to  present  to  Senator 
Snowe at the conclusion of this hearing. 

As  this  illustrates,  achieving  improved  wireless  service  for  our  State  is  a  thor-

oughly bipartisan effort. 

In  closing,  I  want  to  extend  my  thanks  to  the  Committee  and  its  staff  for  pro-
viding me with the opportunity to share the perspective of Maine’s rural public safe-
ty  officials  with  you  at  this  hearing.  I  especially  want  to  thank  Senator  Snowe  and 
her excellent staff for their assistance in connection with my appearance today.

Maine Sheriffs’ Association 

Resolution  in  Opposition  to  Proposed  Limitation  on  Federal  Universal 

Service Funding for Rural Wireless Expansion 

WHEREAS, the Maine Sheriffs’ Association finds that in at least a portion of each 
County  of  the  State  of  Maine,  and  in  significant  portions  of  the  rural  areas  of  the 
State of Maine, wireless service is either non-existent or unreliable, and 

WHEREAS,  due  to  the  large  size  and  largely  rural  character  of  the  State  of 
Maine, this lack of reliable cellular service puts the health and safety of Maine citi-
zens at great risk, and 

WHEREAS,  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  provides  that  telecommuni-
cations  services  in  rural  areas  of  the  United  States  shall  be  reasonably  comparable 
in price, availability, consumer choice and quality of service to that available in the 
non-rural  portions  of  the  United  States,  and  for  that  purpose  established  the  Fed-
eral Universal Service Fund (‘‘USF’’), and 

WHEREAS, the lack of adequate wireless service in Maine’s rural areas indicates 
that  the  promise  of  ‘‘reasonable  comparable  service’’  included  in  the  Telecommuni-
cations Act of 1996 has not been met, at least in much of rural Maine, and 

WHEREAS, according to the Public Utilities Commission: 

(a)  wireless  subscribership  has  in  Maine  grown  from  368,000  to  630,000  be-
tween 2001 and 2006, and 
(b) in 2006, approximately fifty percent (50 percent) all E–911 calls were placed 
by wireless subscribers. 

Based  on  this,  the  Maine  Sheriffs’  Association  concludes  that  Maine’s  inad-
equately  served  rural  areas  are  falling  farther  and  farther  behind  the  non-rural 
areas  of  the  state  both  in  services  and  in  the  basic  capacity  to  meet  public  safety 
requirements, and 

WHEREAS,  the  continued  expansion  of  cellular  service  throughout  rural  Maine 
is therefore of vital importance to the ability of the sixteen sheriff’s departments of 
Maine to adequately protect the health and safety of the citizens we serve, and 

WHEREAS,  on  May  1,  2007,  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service 
issued  a  Recommended  Decision  recommending  that  the  Federal  Communications

Commission  (‘‘FCC’’)  impose  a  cap  on  USF  support  for  competitive  carriers,  almost 
all of whom are wireless carriers, and 

WHEREAS,  the  proposed  cap  would  limit  USF  funding  for  wireless  expansion  in 
Maine  by  an  estimated  amount  of  $2  million  per  year  in  2007  and  more  in  suc-
ceeding years, and 

WHEREAS,  in  the  opinion  of  the  members  of  the  Maine  Sheriffs  Association  the 
Joint  Board’s  proposed  cap  would  be  harmful  to  the  health,  safety  and  welfare  of 
Maine’s citizens, 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  the  MAINE  SHERIFFS’  ASSOCIATION  hereby  unani-

mously adopts the following resolution: 

(A)  That  the  Maine  Sheriffs’  Association  hereby  finds  that  the  continued  expan-
sion of cellular service is in the best interest of the health and safety of Maine citi-
zens. The current lack of dependable cellular service in rural Maine often 

(1)  Prevents  Maine  law  enforcement  officers  from  carrying  out  their  Homeland 
Security responsibilities and other large-scale operations; 
(2) Prevents Maine law enforcement officers from calling for back-up assistance 
when confronting a violent offender, 
(3) Prevents Maine law enforcement officers from contacting complainants prior 
to arriving at a scene to determine the seriousness of the situation and the need 
for back-up or other emergency services, 
(4)  Prevents  Maine  law  enforcement  officers  and  other  ‘‘first  responders’’  from 
contacting  either  physicians  or  LifeFlight  of  Maine  when  dealing  with  a  life- 
threatening injury requiring immediate attention, and 
(5) In general, hampers the efficient and safe discharge of the duties of law en-
forcement officers in rural Maine; and 

(B)  That  the  Maine  Sheriffs’  Association  hereby  unanimously  opposes  the  May  1 
Recommended Decision of the Federal-State Joint Board and instead urges the FCC 
to  reject  the  proposed  cap  on  funding  for  rural  wireless  expansion  so  as  to  redeem 
the  promise  of  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  to  provide  telecommunications 
services in rural areas of the United States that are reasonably comparable in price, 
availability, consumer choice and quality of service to that available in the non-rural 
portions of the United States; and 

(C)  That  the  Maine  Sheriffs  Association  directs  its  officers  to  take  such  action  as 
they  may  deem  appropriate  to  bring  this  Resolution  to  the  attention  of  the  Maine 
Congressional delegation and the FCC, and to undertake such other actions as they 
deem appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this Resolution. 

IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  hereby  certify  that  the  above  Resolution  has  been 

unanimously adopted by the Maine Sheriffs’ Association.

White Paper 

Federal  Universal  Service  Fund  Support  for  Rural  Cellular  Carriers:  A 
Homeland  Security  Perspective  Based  on  the  Experience  Gained  from 
Hurricane Katrina 

October 2006 

This  White  Paper  will  review  the  homeland  security  implications  of  continued 
Federal  Universal  Service  Fund  (‘‘USF’’)  support  for  wireless  carriers  serving  the 
rural  portions  of  the  United  States.  The  Paper  discusses  the  remarkable  perform-
ance of the rural wireless infrastructure in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina 
and  the  vital  role  played  by  rural  wireless  carriers  in  meeting  the  short-  and  long- 
term  communications  needs  posed  by  that  disaster.  The  paper  also  reviews  the 
FCC’s use of its emergency powers to make USF funds available to provide wireless 
handsets  to  hundreds  of  thousands  of  low-income  storm  victims.  The  Paper  con-
cludes, based on this experience, that USF funding for rural wireless carriers serves 
an  important  homeland  security  function,  and  urges  policymakers  in  the  homeland 
security  area  to  strive  to  ensure  continued  USF  support  for  rural  wireless  carriers. 
A Congressional affirmation that qualifying rural wireless carriers will have predict-
able,  ongoing,  and  guaranteed  access  to  USF  support  until  they  can  complete  the 
build-out  of  America’s  rural  areas  will  allow  Federal,  state  and  local  public  safety

officials  to  design  their  disaster  response  plans  on  that  basis.  This  will  help  them 
to  achieve  the  elusive  goal  of  developing  interoperable  communications  systems  for 
use in disaster situations. 
I. Universal Service Support for Rural Wireless Carriers 

The  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  (the  ‘‘Tel  Act’’)  reaffirmed  the  ‘‘Universal 
Service’’  policy  of  the  United  States,  which,  at  that  time,  had  been  a  hallmark  of 
American  telecommunications  policy  for  over  sixty  years.  To  accomplish  the  Tel 
Act’s  goal  of  ensuring  that  the  rural  portions  of  the  United  States  have  a  level  of 
telecommunications  service  comparable  in  quality  and  price  to  that  found  in  the 
urban  portions  of  the  country,  47  U.S.C.  § 254(b),  Congress  included  provisions  in 
the  Tel  Act  establishing  the  Universal  Service  Fund.  America’s  rural  wireline  car-
riers  promptly  secured  Eligible  Telecommunications  Carrier  (‘‘ETC’’)  status  under 
the Tel Act, allowing them to obtain USF funding. Since the passage of the Tel Act, 
rural  wireline  carriers  have  received  almost  $20,000,000,000  in  USF  support  pay-
ments.  As  almost  all  of  these  carriers  have  fully  built-out  land-line  systems,  the 
wireline carriers have used USF support payments primarily to improve the afford-
ability of rural wireline service.1 

Over  the  past  5  years,  many  rural  wireless  carriers  have  obtained  ETC  status, 
most  in  contested  case  proceedings  at  state  public  utility  commissions,  with  local 
wireline carriers actively participating. Wireless ETCs have been certified in all but 
one  rural  state.  Unlike  their  wireline  counterparts,  most  rural  wireless  carriers 
have immature networks that require substantial additional capital expenditures to 
develop fully built-out systems. Consequently, Wireless ETCs use most of their USF 
funding to expand service in the rural areas that they serve. These carriers typically 
file  build-out  plans  with  state  public  utility  commissions,  which  must  re-certify  the 
carriers annually in order to maintain their ETC status and, hence, their USF fund-
ing. 

Although  wireline  carriers  have  taken  in  almost  $20  billion  in  USF  support  pay-
ments  since  the  passage  of  the  Tel  Act  in  1996,  Wireless  ETCs  over  the  same  time 
period  have  taken  in  just  over  $1  billion  in  the  aggregate.2 The  severe  under-fund-
ing of Wireless ETCs serving rural America (as compared to their wireline counter-
parts) has undermined the Tel Act’s objective, as embodied in Section 254, of having 
service  in  rural  areas  that  is  ‘‘comparable’’  in  quality  and  price  to  that  found  in 
urban  America.  Thus,  although  urban  and  suburban  America  enjoy  virtually  ubiq-
uitous  wireless  service,  today,  10  years  after  the  enactment  of  the  Tel  Act,  many 
portions  of  rural  America  suffer  from  poor  or  non-existent  wireless  service.  For  ex-
ample,  a  report  on  rural  Washington  County,  Maine,  commissioned  by  Maine  Gov-
ernor John E. Baldacci found that 

For  any  business  engaged  in  interstate  and/or  international  commerce,  a  com-
prehensive  network  of  broadband  and  wireless  interconnection  is  as  necessary 
as  the  telephone—as  the  computer  and  cell  phones  have  become  indispensable 
to  business.  Such  infrastructure,  however,  has  established  only  a  tentative  toe-
hold in Washington County.3 

Although  USF  support  has  enabled  Wireless  ETCs  to  expand  their  service  into 
many  rural  communities,  the  above-quoted  Washington  County  Report,  issued  in 
the  fall  of  2005  (nine  years  after  the  Tel  Act  became  effective)  describes  conditions 
that  are  typical  in  many  portions  of  rural  America.  For  these  communities,  contin-
ued USF support for Wireless ETCs is the only realistic hope for building the wire-
less  infrastructure  needed  to  allow  them  to  remain  economically  viable  in  the  21st 
century. 

Lack  of  adequate  wireless  service  also  creates  adverse  public  safety  conditions  in 
rural  America  even  in  non-disaster  situations:  to  cite  just  a  few  examples,  emer-
gency  medical  technicians  cannot  place  wireless  calls  to  arrange  for  medical  care 
and  transportation  for  injured  motorists,  deputy  sheriffs  responding  to  a  domestic 
violence  report  cannot  call  ahead  to  determine  whether  someone  in  the  house  has 
a gun, and ordinary citizens enduring a landline phone outage during a flood or bliz-
zard  are  completely  cutoff  from  any  assistance.  Obviously,  should  a  terrorist  inci-

1 In  other  words,  the  wireline  carriers  and  their  state  regulators  treat  wireline  USF  funds  as 
an  operating  subsidy,  resulting  in  rates  for  local  exchange  service  that  are  lower  than  they 
would be without the USF subsidy.

dent or a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, occur in an under-served rural area, 
the  public  safety  implications  of  inadequate  wireless  service  would  be  catastrophic. 
The  service  provided  by  wireless  carriers  in  the  wake  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  dis-
cussed  below,  demonstrates  the  positive  impact,  from  a  public  safety  standpoint,  of 
adequate wireless service in coping with the disruption caused by a disaster. 
II. The Role of Wireless Carriers in Hurricane Katrina 

Despite the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, the wireless in-
frastructure  in  the  Gulf  Coast  demonstrated  a  remarkable  resiliency.  An  inde-
pendent  panel  convened  by  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (‘‘FCC’’)  re-
ported  that  although  more  than  1,000  wireless  base  stations  were  affected  by 
Katrina,  only  about  1  percent  (1%)  of  the  cell  towers  in  the  area  affected  by  all  of 
the  storms  that  wracked  the  Southeastern  and  Gulf  Coast  in  2005  (including  both 
Katrina  and  Rita)  suffered  any  significant  damage.4 In  general,  the  cell  sites  that 
ceased  to  function  as  a  result  of  Katrina  lost  service  either  due  to  a  power  outage 
or to the loss of connectivity to the landline telephone network. Within a week after 
Katrina hit, approximately 80 percent of the cell sites within the affected area were 
operating.5 Wireless  carriers  restored  service  to  many  areas  on  a  temporary  basis 
using over 500 mobile cellular base stations.6 

On  the  landline  side  of  the  equation,  Katrina  and  the  floods  it  caused  knocked 
out service to over 3,000,000 landline customers. Although Bell South and the other 
affected landline companies restored service to about 90 percent of these lines with-
in 10 days after Katrina’s landfall, the hardest-hit areas suffered prolonged outages 
(weeks or months without service) due to flooded switches, multiple fiber breaks and 
chronic power outages. In these areas, wireless service was virtually the only means 
of  communications  available  to  public  safety  personnel  and  the  general  public.  (See 
Section III below.) 

Many first responders and other public safety workers involved in Katrina-related 
operations  took  advantage  of  Wireless  Priority  Service  (‘‘WPS’’),  which  was  devel-
oped following 9/11 to address wireless network congestion problems encountered in 
emergency situations. In the World Trade Center incident, as in Katrina, many peo-
ple  in  the  affected  area  found  themselves  displaced  from  their  homes  and  places  of 
work. They and their loved ones flooded the wireless network trying to contact each 
other, often causing delays in completing wireless calls. Consequently, public safety 
personnel  encountered  substantial  difficulties  in  completing  emergency  calls  on  the 
wireless network during these congested periods. 

The  WPS  program  is  administered  by  the  National  Communications  System 
(‘‘NCS’’) a Federal agency with various communications-related public safety respon-
sibilities. Dr. Peter Fonash, an NCS official, explained in his statement to the Sen-
ate  Committee  on  Homeland  Security  and  Government  Operations  that,  ‘‘The  need 
[for  a  priority  program]  was  recognized  after  9/11  because  many  Federal  and  State 
and  local  Government  and  industry  leaders  utilize  wireless  as  a  primary  means  of 
mobile communications.’’ 7 In the WPS program, public safety and other critical per-
sonnel  can  enter  a  pre-assigned  WPS  number  when  making  wireless  emergency 
calls during congested periods and get priority service: they are ‘‘moved to the head 
of  the  line,’’  and  are  assigned  the  next  channel  opening  up  on  the  wireless  system. 
The NCS provided WPS service to over 4,000 emergency workers during Hurricanes 
Katrina and Rita.8 
III.  The  FCC’s  Use  of  Universal  Service  Funding  To  Provide  Wireless 

Service to Low-Income Storm Victims 

Hurricane  Katrina  displaced  thousands  of  Gulf  Coast  families.  As  a  result,  the 
restoration  of  landline  phone  service  in  a  given  area  made  little  or  no  difference  in 
the lives of the families whose homes in that area had been destroyed and who were 
living  in  a  series  of  temporary  quarters.  As  the  FCC  observed  in  an  Order  issued 
6  weeks  after  the  storm,  ‘‘Thousands  of  people—many  evacuated  to  neighboring

states—remain  without  telecommunications  service,  unable  to  contact  loved  ones, 
make new living arrangements, or find post-hurricane employment.’’ 9 

Recognizing  that  many  of  the  storm’s  victims  were  low-income  families,  the  FCC 
exercised  its  emergency  powers  to  make  $39  million  available  from  the  Universal 
Service  Fund  to  reimburse  wireless  carriers  willing  to  provide  a  free  wireless 
handset and 300 free minutes to low-income storm victims. The FCC estimated that 
about  300,000  households  would  be  eligible  for  this  benefit.10 The  FCC’s  Order  un-
derscores  both  the  role  played  by  the  Universal  Service  Fund  in  making  wireless 
service available to low income consumers and their extraordinary need for wireless 
service: 

We  note  that  this  relief,  combined  with  the  action  we  took  earlier  with  regard 
to  waiver  of  the  geographic  porting  requirements,  would  allow  evacuees  to 
maintain  their  home  phone  numbers,  and  promote  continuity  with  regard  to 
personal  contacts,  employment,  education,  and  housing.  Under  the  unique  and 
devastating  circumstances  caused  by  the  hurricane  and  its  aftermath,  we  con-
clude  that  provision  of  this  support,  including  a  free  wireless  handset,  is  con-
sistent with the purpose of section 254 [of the Tel Act] because it is reasonably 
necessary  to  ensure  that  low  income  consumers  have  immediate  access  to  tele-
communications services. We further find that this support fulfills the Commis-
sion’s broader mandate to make wire and radio communication service available 
to  all  people  of  the  United  States,  and  to  promote  the  safety  of  life  and  prop-
erty.11 

Under  the  terms  of  the  FCC’s  Hurricane  Katrina  Order,  the  temporary  relief  af-
forded  under  that  Order  originally  expired  on  March  1,  2006.  In  advance  of  that 
date, the Louisiana Public Service Commission and T-Mobile successfully petitioned 
the FCC for an extension of the program. T-Mobile’s Petition noted that it had dis-
tributed  over  25,000  handsets  under  the  program.  (By  the  time  T-Mobile  filed  its 
Comments with the FCC’s Hurricane Katrina Panel in May of 2006, the number of 
handsets  distributed  by  T-Mobile  alone  exceeded  44,000.)  The  FCC’s  March  1,  2006 
Order  extending  the  term  for  USF  funding  of  wireless  service  for  low-income 
Katrina victims (‘‘FCC Extension Order’’) observed that: 

The  purpose  of  the  original  relief  was  to  provide  some  stability  and  continuity 
of  access  to  telecommunications  for  Hurricane  Katrina  victims  while  they  were 
away from their destroyed homes and transitioning to a more permanent living 
situation. Because many of the hurricane victims remain displaced, we find that 
it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  extend  the  provision  of  the  Federal  Lifeline 
Katrina relief until June 1, 2006.12 

The  FCC’s  October  2005  Hurricane  Katrina  Order  and  its  March  1,  2006  Exten-
sion  Order  exemplify  the  compelling  need  for  continued  USF  funding  to  support 
wireless service under disaster conditions. In the case of Katrina, USF-funded wire-
less service proved invaluable not only in meeting the public-safety-related commu-
nications  needs  of  first  responders  and  personnel  involved  in  storm  clean-up  activi-
ties,  but  also  to  afford  some  means  of  communications  for  the  hundreds  of  thou-
sands of average Americans displaced by the catastrophe. For these people, a USF- 
funded  wireless  handset  was  the  sole  means  of  communications  with  other  family 
members,  employers  and  government  relief  agencies.  Continuing  and  prudent  in-
vestment  of  high-cost  support  funds  for  wireless  infrastructure  in  rural  areas  will 
improve the availability of these important health and safety benefits. 
IV.  Cellular  South:  Portrait  of  a  Wireless  ETC’s  Role  in  Katrina  and  its 

Aftermath 

Located  in  Jackson,  Mississippi,  Cellular  South  provides  wireless  service  to  5.8 
million  customers  in  both  rural  and  urban  portions  of  the  State  of  Mississippi.  It 
also  provides  service  in  four  other  states  in  the  southeastern  United  States.  The 
State  of  Mississippi  certified  Cellular  South  as  an  ETC  in  2001,  and  the  company 
began receiving USF support shortly thereafter. 

9 FCC Hurricane Katrina Order, October 14, 2005 (‘‘FCC Hurricane Katrina Order’’), at 2. The 
FCC  noted  that  ‘‘Unless  addressed,  this  lack  of  access  to  telecommunications  will  lengthen  the 
already-long  period  of  time  anticipated  for  recovery  from  the  damage  caused  by  Hurricane 
Katrina.’’ Id. at 4. 

10 ‘‘We  estimate  that  this  will  have  approximately  a  $39  million  impact  on  the  low-income 
fund,  based  on  an  estimated  $130  per  approximately  300,000  eligible  evacuee  households  with-
out telephone service.’’ FCC Hurricane Katrina Order at n. 23.

The  USF  support  has  allowed  Cellular  South  to  convert  much  of  its  network  to 
modern CDMA technology, increase substantially the capacity of its system, and ex-
pand  its  service  through  the  construction  of  numerous  new  cellular  sites  in  many 
rural  communities  that  would  otherwise  not  have  high-quality  mobile  service.  In 
2006  alone,  Cellular  South  plans  to  add  approximately  225  new  cell  sites  at  a  cost 
of $126 million, a significant portion of which will be funded through USF support.13 
As  an  ETC,  Cellular  South  has  provided  Federal  Lifeline  and  Link-Up  benefits 
to  low  income  customers.  Consequently,  eligible  low-income  rural  customers  living 
within Cell South’s ETC territory have a choice of providers, and can obtain Cellular 
South wireless service for as little as $7.00 per month.14 

Thanks  to  careful  planning  and  the  extraordinary  dedication  of  its  workforce, 
sixty  percent  (60%)  of  Cellular  South’s  Gulf  Coast  network  was  operational  1  day 
after Katrina hit, and full service was restored to the entire network within 2 weeks 
after  landfall.  In  many  of  the  hardest  hit  areas,  Cellular  South  had  the  only  oper-
ational  communications  network  in  the  weeks  following  the  storm’s  coming  ashore. 
Remarkably, Cellular South did not lose a single tower on the Mississippi coast, and 
never lost wireless service at any time in some of the hardest-hit areas such as Hat-
tiesburg, Biloxi and Bay St. Louis.15 On the day after the storm hit, Cellular South 
handled  a  record  1,000,000  calls,  and  over  the  next  few  weeks  its  daily  volume 
surged to 2,600,000 calls per day. 

In the first week after the storm, Cellular South assisted over 7,000 storm victims 
and evacuees at various phone banks it established, and offered free cellular calling 
and free handset charging to all wireless customers regardless of the customer’s car-
rier.  More  than  90  percent  of  the  company’s  retail  locations  were  open  after  the 
storm,  with  storefronts  in  Biloxi,  Bay  St.  Louis  and  Hattiesburg  operating  out  of 
tents.16 Realizing  that  it  had  the  only  operational  communications  network  avail-
able  on  the  Gulf  Coast,  the  company  distributed  over  500  handsets  at  no  charge  to 
public safety personnel in the Gulf Coast region.17 

Cellular  South’s  ability  to  maintain  the  continuity  of  its  service  despite  the 
storm’s  wholesale  destruction  enabled  public  safety  officials  to  carry  out  their  dis-
aster  relief  responsibilities  in  a  remarkably  efficient  manner,  given  the  wholesale 
disruption of the region’s landline telecommunications infrastructure. George Scholl, 
the Director of the Jackson County (Mississippi) Emergency District, explained: 

Throughout  the  worst  of  the  storm,  I  used  my  Cellular  South  phone  to  stay  in 
touch  with  Bell  South  to  coordinate  9-1-1  coverage  and  with  Motorola  officials 
to  coordinate  repair  of  our  primary  800  MHz  radio  system.  After  the  storm, 
even  with  the  800  MHz  system  restored  to  full  capability  for  operational  use 
by  first  responders,  there  was  a  continuing  need  by  county  and  city  command 
structures  for  an  ‘‘administrative’’  system  to  either  replace  destroyed  landline 
phones  or  to  enable  workers  to  move  immediately  into  alternate  facilities  that 
had  no  communications  capabilities.  Cellular  South  was  vital  in  helping  to  ful-
fill this need and continues to do so.18 

Likewise,  Jim  Catchot,  the  E-911  Dispatcher  for  the  Ocean  Springs,  Mississippi, 

Police Department stated: 

I  work  as  a  dispatcher  for  the  Ocean  Springs  Police  Department.  During  the 
storm my Cellular South phone was the only phone I could count on to be work-
ing at all times. I never lost a signal and was able to use the phone as needed. 
Also, the police officers were able to use the phone to check on family and loved 
ones. 

Mr.  Catchot’s  remark  regarding  the  average  citizen’s  need  for  Cellular  South’s 
highly resilient wireless service for communicating with loved ones was echoed over 
and  over  again  throughout  the  beleaguered  Gulf  Coast.  For  example,  a  Biloxi 
woman  who  was  evacuated  to  Hattiesburg  wrote  to  Cellular  South  thanking  the 
company for its outstanding service and provided the following typical story:

I  never  lost  cell  phone  service  through  the  entire  storm  and  after.  I  was  able 
to stay in contact with my father on the coast on his Cellular South cell phone— 
although he did lose his ability to call out I could still call him. After the storm 
while walking down the streets of what was left of my town I came across cry-
ing people standing on what used to be their homes. So many people were able 
to use my cell phone to call their families in other states to let them know they 
were okay. I came across a 79 year old woman crying on the side walk. I offered 
to  let  her  use  my  phone  to  call  her  family.  She  was  amazed  that  my  phone 
worked,  she  lost  her  house  and  was  able  to  call  her  family  in  LA  to  come  and 
get  her.  She  hugged  me  and  cried  and  thanked  me.  Of  all  the  cell  phone  serv-
ices  I  am  so  happy  to  have  Cellular  South.  Without  my  working  cell  phone  I 
would have not known if my family or friends were okay. Thank you.19 

Recognizing  the  extraordinary  performance  of  Cellular  South,  its  management 
and  its  employees,  in  providing  outstanding  wireless  service  through  the  Katrina 
disaster, the Mississippi Legislature enacted a Resolution commending: 

the executives and employees of Cellular South for their exemplary service, con-
duct and performance rendered prior to and subsequent to Hurricane Katrina’s 
unprecedented  destruction  on  and  near  the  Mississippi  Gulf  Coast  in  August 
and  September  2005,  and  we  offer  our  thanks  to  these  individuals  for  their  as-
sistance  in  providing  communications  during  this  critical  time,  as  we  endeavor 
to rebuild our state and restore its economy.20 

Based on the lessons learned from Katrina, Cellular South plans to invest an ad-
ditional $8 million to enhance the resiliency of its network even further through the 
installation  of  measures  such  as  microwave  links  that  will  allow  it  to  bypass  the 
landline  network  to  complete  calls  in  the  event  of  another  disaster  and  a  mobile 
command center.21 

In  its  Comments  filed  with  the  FCC’s  Katrina  Panel,  Cellular  South  emphasized 
that  its  status  as  an  ETC,  and  its  receipt  of  USF  support,  was  a  critical  factor  in 
its ability to provide vital wireless service during and after Katrina. 

Cellular South has used USF to deploy and operate Cellular South’s CDMA net-
work  in  rural,  high-cost  areas  of  Mississippi  and  Alabama,  including  many  of 
the  areas  affected  by  Hurricane  Katrina.  Without  USF,  Cellular  South’s  re-
sponse  to  Hurricane  Katrina  and  the  access  and  capacity  that  Cellular  South 
provided to first responders and CDMA users would have been significantly re-
duced.22 

V.  Conclusion:  Homeland  Security  Considerations  Alone  Warrant 

Continuation of USF Support for Rural Wireless Carriers 

This White Paper has demonstrated that: 

(a) wireless carriers provided a critical communications service during and after 
Hurricane  Katrina.  Specifically,  Cellular  South,  a  rural  wireless  carrier  ETC, 
had  the  only  operational  communications  network  in  many  portions  of  the  Gulf 
Coast in the period during and after landfall; 
(b)  first  responders  and  other  public  safety  personnel  rely  extensively  (and  in 
many  cases  solely)  on  wireless  service,  including  the  service  provided  by  Wire-
less  ETCs,  to  meet  their  emergency  and  administrative  communications  needs 
in the wake of Katrina; 
(c)  the  widespread  availability  of  wireless  service  in  the  areas  hit  by  Katrina 
effectively  mitigated  the  ‘‘interoperability  problem’’  that  plagued  public  safety 
personnel in the World Trade Center and other disasters, since wireless service 
was virtually the only telecommunications service available in many areas; 
(d)  the  FCC’s  Wireless  Priority  System,  implemented  after  the  World  Trade 
Center  disaster,  further  enhanced  the  effectiveness  of  wireless  service  as  the 
primary  communications  mode  for  public  safety  personnel  working  in  the  Gulf 
Coast area; 
(e)  Federal  high-cost  USF  support  for  Cellular  South  and  other  ETCs  serving 
the  areas  affected  by  Katrina  enabled  the  supported  carriers  to  install  a  broad

and  resilient  network  in  many  rural  areas  that  would  not  otherwise  have  the 
benefits of mobile service; 
and 
(f)  Supplemental  low-income  USF  support  provided  by  the  FCC  for  wireless 
ETCs was critical in making free handsets and 300 minutes of wireless network 
time available to hundreds of thousands of low-income Katrina victims. 

These  facts  alone  should  be  sufficient  to  compel  the  conclusion  that  continued 
Federal  USF  funding  for  rural  wireless  ETCs  should  be  an  urgent  homeland  secu-
rity priority. 

The FCC’s actions in making millions of USF dollars available to wireless carriers 
to furnish Katrina victims with the means to purchase and use wireless telephones 
also  underscores  the  fact  that  in  disaster  situations,  commercial  mobile  wireless 
service  is  the  best  reasonably  available  means  of  communications  for  the  general 
public.  The  FCC  recognized  that  people  displaced  from  their  homes  and  businesses 
and  moving  from  place  to  place  must  have  good  mobile  service  to  provide  the  con-
tinuity of communications needed to function in today’s world. 

The  Gulf  Coast  region  was  fortunate  in  that  it  enjoyed  a  fairly  robust  wireless 
network—thanks,  in  significant  part,  to  the  USF  funding  previously  provided  to 
rural  Wireless  ETCs  such  as  Cellular  South.  Should  a  powerful  and  disruptive 
storm,  or  a  terrorist  incident,  strike  an  area  of  the  United  States  that  suffers  from 
limited  or  no  mobile  service,  the  absence  of  adequate  wireless  communications 
would leave public safety personnel, such as first responders, and the general public 
in  a  communications  vacuum.  A  Katrina-level  storm  hitting  Washington  County, 
Maine,  for  example,  where  mobile  service  ‘‘has  established  only  a  tentative  toe-
hold,’’ 23 would be devastating. 

Continued  USF  funding  of  rural  wireless  carriers  will  ensure  that  over  time,  the 
Universal  Service  promise  of  the  Tel  Act  will  be  achieved:  rural  areas  will  have  a 
mobile communications system comparable to that enjoyed in non-rural areas. This, 
in  turn,  will  ensure  that  the  people  living  in  rural  areas  will  likewise  have  a  com-
munications  system  adequate  to  see  them  through  the  kind  of  man-made  and  nat-
ural  disasters  that  have  struck  the  more  settled  areas  of  the  United  States.  With 
roughly  $7  billion  of  Federal  USF  being  distributed  annually,  Federal  policies  that 
accelerate wireless infrastructure development in rural areas must be pursued. 

On  the  other  hand,  discontinuing  this  funding  will  consign  communications  in 
rural America to permanent second-class status, with obvious implications for rural 
America’s  economic  vitality  as  well  as  its  ability  to  survive  significant  natural  or 
man-made disasters. 

Public  safety  in  America’s  rural  areas,  both  in  disaster  and  non-disaster  situa-
tions,  requires  Congressional  action,  in  the  homeland  security  context,  reaffirming 
that USF support for rural Wireless ETCs will continue at least until the build-out 
of  America’s  wireless  network  has  reached  all  of  the  rural  portions  of  the  United 
States.

Katrina’s  destruction,  the  Mississippi-based  company  never  lost  service  in  parts  of 
the most storm-ravaged areas, particularly in Hattiesburg and Biloxi and had teams 
in  place  that  began  immediate  repairs  of  cell  sites  and  infrastructure  following  the 
storm; and 

WHEREAS,  on  Monday,  August  29,  2005,  Hurricane  Katrina,  a  Category  Four 
Hurricane,  crashed  with  unrelenting  and  violent  force  onto  the  entire  Mississippi 
Gulf Coast, making landfall at or around Waveland, Mississippi. In 1 day, the worst 
natural  disaster  in  our  history  struck  us  a  grievous  blow,  leaving  a  90-mile  swath 
of  destruction  along  the  coast  and  causing  severe  damage  throughout  central  and 
north Mississippi; and 

WHEREAS,  the  reliability  of  the  Cellular  South  network  after  the  storm  is  re-
flected in the fact that the company has seen a 256 percent increase in the number 
of  minutes  carried  on  behalf  of  other  carriers’  customers  since  the  storm  in  the  af-
fected area. The increase equates to more than 8.5 million minutes of usage (MOUs) 
from other carriers’ customers, following the storm; and 

WHEREAS,  ‘‘Cellular  South  employees,  some  of  whom  were  dealing  with  their 
own  personal  losses,  knew  that  communication  was  critical  for  hurricane  victims 
and evacuees and they did everything they could to fully restore our customers’ abil-
ity  to  reach  loved  ones  or  call  for  emergency  help  in  the  aftermath  of  the  storm,’’ 
said  Hu  Meena,  company  President.  ‘‘As  just  one  example,  The  Washington  Post 
noted in one of its stories a Cellular South network technician in Biloxi who literally 
crawled  out  of  his  home  that  had  been  destroyed  by  a  fallen  tree,  got  his  family  to 
safety and then traveled to the nearest cell site to begin repair work;’’ and 

WHEREAS,  Cellular  South  utilized  300  generators  and  20,000  gallons  of  fuel,  as 
well  as  over  400  employees  dedicated  to  restoring  the  network  as  quickly  as  pos-
sible. Through the dedication and hard work of the team, the network was restored 
ahead  of  schedule,  and  reported  record  minutes  of  use  upon  restoration  of  service. 
Cellular  South  donated  over  1,000  phones  to  local,  state  and  Federal  officials  who 
worked  and  are  still  working  to  rebuild  Mississippi,  as  well  as  to  many  Red  Cross 
Shelters  so  that  hurricane  victims  would  have  a  way  to  communicate  with  their 
loved  ones.  Cellular  South  donated  a  total  of  50  million  free  relief  minutes  to  cus-
tomers in the hardest hit of areas; and 

WHEREAS, while it is still early to complete a full assessment, estimates indicate 
the  financial  impact  of  Hurricane  Katrina  on  Cellular  South  are  likely  to  be  in  the 
range  of  $8  to  $12  million;  and  yet,  the  company’s  goal  was  to  do  whatever  it  took 
to  restore  service  for  customers  and  take  care  of  employees—both  those  affected  by 
Hurricane Katrina and those working to restore wireless service: 

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF 
MISSISSIPPI,  THE  HOUSE  OF  REPRESENTATIVES  CONCURRING  THEREIN, 
That  we  do  hereby  commend  the  executives  and  employees  of  Cellular  South  for 
their exemplary service, conduct and performance rendered prior to and subsequent 
to  Hurricane  Katrina’s  unprecedented  destruction  on  and  near  the  Mississippi  Gulf 
Coast in August and September, 2005, and we offer our thanks to these individuals 
for their assistance in providing communications during this critical time, as we en-
deavor to rebuild our state and restore its economy. 

BE  IT  FURTHER  RESOLVED,  That  this  resolution  be  forwarded  to  Mr.  Hu 
Meena,  President  of  Cellular  South,  and  be  made  available  to  the  Capitol  Press 
Corps. 

LETTERS FROM MAINE PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN OPPOSITION TO PROPOSED CAP 

EXHIBIT 4 

June 6, 2007 

Hon. KEVIN J. MARTIN, 
Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Chairman Martin: 

I  am  writing  to  express  my  concern  regarding  the  recent  recommendation  by  the 
Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service that the Commission impose a tem-
porary  cap  on  the  amount  of  support  that  competitive  eligible  telecommunications 
carriers (ETCs) may receive through the Universal Service Fund (USF). 

While  I  understand  the  Joint  Board’s  concern  that  the  rapid  growth  in  high-cost 
support is unsustainable and places the Fund in jeopardy, I believe that the impact 
of the proposed interim cap would be felt disproportionately by Maine.

Two  wireless  ETCs  serve  high-cost  rural  areas  of  Maine  with  the  assistance  of 
USF support. These companies have told me that they had planned to invest a total 
of  $15  million  in  new  service  towers  and  other  infrastructure  in  Maine  this  year. 
If the cap is implemented, these companies may be forced to curtail investments by 
$2  million,  and  will  likely  forego  construction  of  five  cell  towers,  sacrificing  des-
perately needed coverage in hard to reach areas of my home state. 

I am hopeful that the Commission can find an alternative means of reforming the 
Universal  Service  Fund  without  adopting  the  interim  cap  proposed  by  the  Joint 
Board. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, 

SUSAN M. COLLINS, 
United States Senator. 

June 5, 2007 

Hon. KEVIN J. MARTIN, 
Chairman, 
Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Chairman Martin: 

I  understand  that  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  is  currently  consid-
ering  whether  to  adopt  the  recent  recommendations  of  the  Federal-State  Joint 
Board on Universal Service that would place a cap on payments from the Universal 
Service  Fund  (USF)  for  competitive  eligible  telecommunications  carriers  (CETCs). 
Most  CETCs  are  wireless  carriers  serving  rural  areas  of  the  country,  including 
much  of  my  home  State  of  Maine,  and  have  used  USF  funding  to  expand  wireless 
infrastructure  in  regions  which  continue  to  suffer  from  cellular  telephone  coverage 
that  is  far  below  the  quality  experienced  in  urban  areas  of  the  United  States.  Be-
cause the proposed cap would unduly deter continued investment in expanding wire-
less service in rural America, I urge the Commission to reject the Joint Board’s rec-
ommendations. 

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 established the USF in order to ensure that 
our  rural  areas  would  have  a  level  of  telecommunications  service  reasonably  com-
parable,  in  terms  of  prices  and  availability  of  modem  services,  to  that  found  in 
urban  areas  of  the  United  States.  Most  Maine  residents  and  visitors  would  agree 
that this promise has not been kept with respect to wireless service, which is either 
spotty or non-existent throughout many of the state’s rural communities. This is not 
a  mere  inconvenience.  Poor  mobile  telephone  service  undermines  the  ability  of 
Maine’s  law  enforcement  officers  to  deliver  basic  public  safety  services.  Moreover, 
the  public  increasingly  relies  upon  wireless  service  to  contact  public  safety  officials 
during  an  emergency:  according  to  the  Maine  Public  Utilities  Commission,  nearly 
50  percent  of  9-1-1  calls  placed  in  2006  were  dialed  with  a  cellular  telephone.  The 
inability  to  get  a  signal  on  one’s  mobile  phone  could  very  well  be  a  matter  of  life 
and death. 

Maine’s substandard wireless coverage also hinders our rural communities’ efforts 
to  attract  new  economic  development.  A  cap  on  funding  for  wireless  service  expan-
sion, as proposed by the Joint Board, will have a disproportionately negative impact 
on  these  endeavors.  In  today’s  world,  telecommunications  means  more  than  just  a 
landline  telephone  connection.  The  technological  advancements  of  the  past  decade, 
as  well  as  those  expected  in  the  decade  to  come,  have  long  been  viewed  as  a  key 
mechanism for reducing the economic competitiveness gap between urban and rural 
areas.  The  Joint  Board’s  recommendations,  if  adopted,  could  very  well  have  the  re-
verse effect, and exacerbate this gap. 

As an author of USF legislation in each of the last three Congresses, I am keenly 
aware  of  the  financial  strains  the  Fund  is  experiencing  and  the  need  for  a  solution 
to  provide  it  long-term  stability.  The  Joint  Board’s  recommendation,  proffered  as  a 
short-term solution, is also short-sighted. If implemented, investment in the wireless 
infrastructure  so  desperately  needed  in  rural  America  will  almost  certainly  be  cur-
tailed.  If  belt-tightening  is  truly  warranted,  it  should  be  done  in  a  manner  that 
equally affects all segments of the industry and regions of the country, not imposed 
solely on wireless carriers who serve rural customers. 

In  stabilizing  and  strengthening  the  USF,  the  Commission’s  goal  should  be  to 
craft  equitable  and  permanent  solutions  that  reflect  Congressional  intent  as  em-
bodied  in  the  1996  Telecommunications  Act,  to  develop  Universal  Service  mecha-
nisms  that  provide  rural  consumers  with  choices  in  advanced  telecommunications

services,  and  to  develop  strategies  that  encourage  all  stakeholders  to  meaningfully

RE: WC DOCKET NO. 05–337 

I am writing in opposition to the proposed cap on Universal Service Fund support 
to competitive eligible telecommunications carriers (CETCs) as recommended by the 
Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service. 

The  Universal  Service  Fund  faces  a  fiscal  challenge,  and  I  appreciate  the  FCC’s 
attention  and  commitment  to  comprehensive  reform  of  the  Fund.  However,  I  am 
concerned that approval of a cap on CETC support, though meant to be a temporary 
measure, could further delay needed reform. Though the Joint Board has stated its 
intention  to  make  further  recommendations  within  6  months,  I  am  concerned  that 
a cap, even if temporary, would set a precedent of singling out one sector of the tele-
communications industry. 

Maine has two wireless ETCs that have productively used Universal Service funds 
to expand service to remote areas in our largely rural state. The growth in Maine’s 
support has been moderate, not explosive. I believe the cap as proposed would nega-
tively  impact  the  expansion  of  modern  telecommunications  services  of  all  types  to 
residents in rural Maine. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your response. 

With warmest regards,

RE: WC DOCKET NO. 05–337 

I am writing to voice my opposition to the proposed cap on Universal Service sup-
port  to  competitive  eligible  telecommunications  carriers  (CETCs)  as  recommended 
by the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service. 

I appreciate the fiscal situation facing the Universal Service Fund and understand 
the  desire  to  institute  urgent  measures  to  address  the  financial  issues.  While  the 
cap on CETC support is proposed as a temporary measure, I am concerned that its 
approval  could  act  as  a  pressure  valve  that  could  lead  to  further  delay  of  com-
prehensive reform. 

It  is  true  that  payments  to  CETCs  are  the  fastest  growing  element  of  the  high- 
cost  fund  By  its  nature,  freezing  CETC  contributions  improves  the  fiscal  outlook  of 
the  overall  fund.  My  worry  is  that  this  action  will  act  as  a  pressure  valve  and  de-
crease  the  urgency  for  broader  reform.  While  I  appreciate  the  Joint  Board’s  inten-
tion to make further recommendations within 6 months, if it does not, we could see 
a  ‘‘new  norm’’  within  the  high-cost  fund  that  leaves  one  sector  of  the  industry  un-
fairly singled out. 

Maine has two wireless ETCs that have productively used Universal Service funds 
to expand service to remote areas in our largely rural state. The growth in Maine’s 
support  has  been  moderate,  not  explosive.  It  is  not  fair  that  residents  in  rural

Maine  should  lose  the  access  to  modern  telecommunications  services  under  a  one- 
size-fits-all cap. 

Again,  I  urge  the  Commission  to  reject  the  proposed  cap  on  CETC  and  work  to-

ward comprehensive solutions to control cost growth in Universal Service funds.

RE: PROPOSED CAP ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUNDING 

Dear Senator Snowe: 

Last  July,  I  wrote  to  you  asking  your  help  in  ensuring  that  telecommunications 
reform  legislation  then  before  the  Senate  would  not  have  an  adverse  impact  on 
much-needed Federal Universal Service Fund payments. As my July 24, 2006 letter 
indicated  (copy  attached),  Unicel  and  United  States  Cellular,  Maine’s  two  wireless 
Eligible  Telecommunications  Carriers  (‘‘ETCs’’),  are  moving  aggressively  to  imple-
ment their ambitious build-out programs in Maine using these funds. Public under-
standing  of  the  role  of  Federal  Universal  Service  involvement  in  rural  wireless  in-
frastructure  improvement  is  growing,  as  demonstrated  in  the  attached  editorial, 
which appeared in the January 30 edition of the Bangor Daily News. 

I  was  pleased  to  learn  of  your  successful  efforts  on  last  year’s  bill—I  understand 
that the final version of Sen. Stevens’ legislation was benign, if not favorable, in this 
regard.  Unfortunately,  I  again  need  to  request  your  assistance  on  an  issue  relating 
to wireless ETC funding. 

As I understand it, hearings recently conducted by the Senate and House commit-
tees overseeing the Federal Communications Commission (‘‘FCC’’) revealed that the 
Federal-State  Joint  Board  may  recommend  that  the  FCC  ‘‘cap’’  Universal  Service 
funding—but  only  to  competitive  ETCs  (CETCs)  operating  in  rural  areas—pending 
a reform of the FCC’s Universal Service distribution mechanism. I am advised that 
this  rural  funding  cap  would  stay  in  place  for  as  long  as  2  years  while  the  Joint 
Board  and  FCC  consider  possible  changes  to  the  distribution  mechanism  for  Uni-
versal Service support. 

Given  rural  Maine’s  significant  need  for  infrastructure  development,  I  am  deeply 
troubled  by  the  notion  of  capping  rural  CETC  funding  just  when  our  two  wireless 
ETCs  are  aggressively  building  new  rural  network  facilities.  I  certainly  understand 
the need for proper stewardship of the Universal Service mechanism. However, even 
if FCC Chairman Martin’s estimate—that funds to CETCs will grow by $300 million 
in  2007—comes  to  pass,  the  projected  growth  would  be  less  than  5  percent  of  the 
total $7 billion fund—hardly an emergency situation. 

Also, I cannot understand why rural people should bear the full brunt of any cap, 
especially  in  light  of  the  enormous  health,  public  safety  and  economic  development 
disadvantage that rural areas suffer due to the lack of wireless infrastructure. 

Accordingly,  I  urge  you  to  advise  the  Joint  Board  that  funding  to  CETCs  should 
not  be  capped,  even  on  an  interim  basis.  There  are  other  ways  to  control  Fund 
growth  and  ensure  competitive  neutrality  without  impeding  the  investment  in  our 
rural infrastructure that Maine citizens so desperately need.

JOHN E. BALDACCI, 

Governor.

spectfully  present  and  petition  the  U.S.  Congress  and  the  Federal  Communications 
Commission as follows: 

WHEREAS,  the  Federal  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  through  the  establish-
ment  of  the  Federal  Universal  Service  Fund  was  intended  to  promote  the  avail-
ability of quality services at just, reasonable and affordable prices, increased access 
to advanced telecommunications services throughout the Nation and the availability 
of  quality  services  to  all  consumers,  including  those  in  low-income,  rural,  insular 
and  high-cost  areas,  at  rates  that  are  reasonably  comparable  to  those  charged  in 
urban areas; and 

WHEREAS, the intended goals of that legislation have not been met in the State 
of Maine, and many of Maine’s communities have no wireless services or inadequate 
wireless service; and 

WHEREAS, the failure to achieve the goals of improved and high-quality services 
has,  and  will  continue  to  have,  a  direct  and  substantial  negative  impact  on  the 
health and safety of the people living and working in Maine’s rural areas; and 

WHEREAS,  the  failure  to  achieve  this  goal  of  high-quality  wireless  services  at 
just, reasonable and affordable rates to everyone is a very significant barrier to the 
economic development of much of rural Maine; and 

WHEREAS,  there  are  2  rural  wireless  carriers  in  Maine  that  have  successfully 
sought  certification  as  eligible  telecommunications  carriers  and  have  used  the  Fed-
eral Universal Service funding they have received to construct significant additional 
wireless infrastructure in rural Maine; and 

WHEREAS, the Maine Public Utilities Commission has certified that these Maine 
rural  wireless  carriers  have  used  the  funds  received  from  the  Federal  Universal 
Service  Fund  in  a  manner  consistent  with  all  laws  and  regulations  governing  the 
funds; and 

WHEREAS, the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service has recommended 
that the Federal Communications Commission impose a cap on funding for competi-
tive eligible telecommunications carriers; and 

WHEREAS,  this  recommended  cap  would  limit  Federal  Universal  Service  Fund 

support for Maine’s rural wireless carriers currently receiving these funds; and 

WHEREAS, the proposed cap on funding would serve to undercut the purpose and 
objective of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 by impairing the ability of 
Maine’s  wireless  eligible  telecommunications  carriers  to  expand  infrastructure  into 
rural  Maine  so  that  rural  and  urban  wireless  service  is  equal,  as  promised  by  that 
Act; now, therefore, be it 

RESOLVED:  That  We,  your  Memorialists,  on  behalf  of  the  people  we  represent, 
take  this  opportunity  to  request  that  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  re-
ject  the  cap  proposed  by  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service;  and 
be it further 

RESOLVED:  That  We,  your  Memorialists,  respectfully  urge  and  request  that  the 
United States Congress take action to repeal the cap if it is adopted by the Federal 
Communications Commission; and be it further 

RESOLVED:  That  suitable  copies  of  this  resolution,  duly  authenticated  by  the 
Secretary  of  State,  be  transmitted  to  the  Honorable  Kevin  J.  Martin,  Chairman  of 
the  Federal  Communications  Commission,  to  the  President  of  the  U.S.  Senate,  to

Before the Federal Communications Commission 

Washington, DC 

In the Matter of Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service 
High-Cost Universal Service Support 
CC Docket No. 96–45 
WC Docket No. 05–337 
Comments of the Maine Public Utilities Commission 

The  Maine  Public  Utilities  Commission  (MPUC)  is  a  state  regulatory  agency 
charged  with  ensuring  that  there  is  a  regulatory  system  consistent  with  the  public 
interest  and  with  State  law.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  State  of  Maine  to  ensure  that 
access to advanced services be made available to all communities without regard to 
geographic  location,  35–A  M.R.S.A.  § 7101.  With  these  duties  in  mind,  the  MPUC 
files  these  initial  comments  in  response  to  the  Notice  of  the  Commission  published 
in the Federal Register on May 23, 2007. 

We  recognize  that  the  existing  Universal  Service  Fund  mechanism  for  providing 
support  to  competitive  carriers  is  causing  the  Federal  Universal  Service  Fund  to 
grow  substantially  in  some  areas  of  the  country.  We  also  recognize  that  the  ‘‘equal 
support rule’’ which bases support payments for Competitive Eligible Telecommuni-
cations Carriers (CETCs) on the support payments of the incumbent carrier is caus-
ing the Fund to grow dramatically. The ‘‘equal support rule’’ is also providing more 
total support than is needed in some states because in those states the incumbent’s 
costs  are  much  greater  then  those  incurred  by  the  wireless  CLEC  to  provide  full 
rural area wireless coverage. Furthermore, in some states the CETC support is not 
being used by carriers for rural ‘‘build-out’’ purposes. 

Nevertheless,  there  are  states,  such  as  Maine,  where  the  current  CETC  support 
is not excessive. This occurs because the costs of rural wireless build-out are higher 
than the national average and in many cases are higher than the costs for providing 
wireline  service.  The  MPUC  also  requires  that  all  CETC  support  be  used  to  build- 
out rural systems and it monitors compliance with that requirement. 

The capping of the CETC support at 2006 average payment level will likely cause 
delay  in  the  construction  of  towers  in  Maine  that  have  been  planned  for  the  next 
year,  even  if  Maine  designates  no  additional  CETCs.  These  planned  towers  would 
generate  little  if  no  revenue  for  the  wireless  carrier  because  the  areas  they  serve 
have  very  few  fixed  customer  locations.  Nevertheless,  the  public  health  and  safety 
requires  remote  areas  to  be  provided  with  mobile  wireless  service  and  Universal 
Service support for such service should be continued. 

Instead  of  capping  the  CETC  fund  nationally  at  average  2006  levels  for  each 
state, the MPUC suggests capping the Fund only in those states where growth has 
been excessive and where state commissions have not established mechanisms to in-
sure  that  all  CETC  support  is  used  for  rural  build-out  purposes.  If  the  growth  in 
CETC support for each state were limited to provide funds needed to cover planned 
rural  build-out  projects  and  states  were  required  to  certify  that  the  support  was 
both  needed  and  being  used  for  rural  build-out  purposes,  the  growth  in  the  Fund 
should  be  controlled.  Rural  wireless  build-out  could  then  continue  at  a  moderate 
price while support mechanisms for CETCs are reexamined. 

The  solution  to  controlling  rapid  growth  of  the  CETC  USF  should  focus  on  those 
areas  causing  the  problem  and  not  penalize  those  areas,  such  as  Maine,  where  the 
growth  in  the  Fund  has  been  moderate  and  all  funds  have  been  used  for  their  in-
tended  purpose.  Since  the  FCC  has  not  acted  on  meaningful  Universal  Service  re-
form since 2001, we are very skeptical that the proposed emergency cap will, in re-
ality,  last  for  a  short  time  as  the  concept’s  advocates  suggest.  Rather,  we  believe 
an extended moratorium will occur that will significantly delay rural infrastructure 
investment  in  advanced  services.  Therefore,  a  cap  at  average  2006  levels  is  likely 
to irreparably harm rural residents of Maine. 

Accordingly,  the  MPUC  respectfully  suggests  that  the  Commission  give  serious 
consideration  to  the  approach  suggested  above  so  that  wireless  rural  build-out  may 
continue in Maine and other similarly situated areas. 

Respectfully submitted, 

TRINA M. BRAGDON, Esq., 

Maine Public Utilities Commission. 

Senator STEVENS. Thank you very much. 
On behalf of the Chairman, let me ask you his questions. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:14 May 07, 2012 Jkt 074012 PO 00000 Frm 00081 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74012.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

78 

This  first  question  would  be  to  all  members  of  the  panel.  One 
criticism  of  the  so-called  ‘‘identical  support  rule’’  for  Universal 
Service  is  that  it  results  in  an  overly  generous  support  to  wireless 
carriers because levels of support are based on the cost of providing 
wireline  services.  In  light  of  this,  Chairman  Inouye  wants  three 
questions answered. ‘‘Do you believe that Universal Service should 
support both wireline and wireless service in rural America? Would 
it  be  possible  to  construct  a  model  for  wireless  carriers  that  would 
calculate  support  based  upon  the  cost  of  wireless  carriers?  Third, 
what  effect  would  tying  wireless  support  to  wireless  cost  have  on 
the size of the Fund?’’ 

Mr. Rooney? 
Mr.  ROONEY.  Let  me  take  it  in  order.  First  of  all,  I  would  say 
that  it  would  be  in  the  interest  of  the  government,  the  U.S.  Gov-
ernment,  and  good  policy,  to  have  the  lowest-cost  provider  of  serv-
ice  being  the  primary  provider  of  service  in  the  area.  I  think  tech-
nology  has  overtaken  things  that  have  taken  place  in  the  past.  If 
wireless  service  provides  service  in  the  most  economical  and  rea-
sonable  fashion—those  costs  should  be  used,  but  they  should  be 
used  for  everyone  that  is  providing  that  service  in  those  areas.  In 
other  words,  this  is  to  use  the  highest  cost  to  justify  recompense 
is sort of turning the whole idea of competition upside-down. 

So, yes, this whole thing needs to be reworked. And we’re not at 
all  opposed  to  a  complete  review  of  this  particular  situation.  I’ve 
been on both wireless and wireline sides of this thing, and basically 
you go back to the days where, you know, wireline service was the 
only  dependable  service.  Wireless  service  now  is  as  dependable  as 
any  service  in  the  world.  And  it  can  be  delivered  at  a  much  lower 
cost. And to continue to subsidize the provision of the high-cost pro-
vider,  rather  than  the  low-cost  provider,  seems  to  me  contrary  to 
everything  that  we  stand  for.  And,  yes,  I’m  pushing  wireless,  be-
cause  I  happen  to  be  in  the  wireless  industry,  but  I  also  know  the 
capabilities of the wireless carrier. 

Senator STEVENS. Thank you. 
Mr. Nishi? 
Mr.  NISHI.  We  believe  that  the  services—wireless  and  landline 
service—they’re  complementary  in  nature.  So,  yes,  we  believe  that 
there should be support for both types of services so that both net-
works  are  sufficiently  built  out.  And  in  the  long-term,  we  believe 
that will benefit all the citizens of the U.S. 

As to the second question, whether a model can be developed for 
wireless support, we believe that one can be developed. Our models 
for  wireline  companies  today  are  based  on  our  cost  of  doing  busi-
ness.  And  we  do  come  up  with  our  costs,  and  the  funds  are  ade-
quately distributed from those costs. 

So,  I  do  believe  the  wireless  industry  can  come  up  with  a  plan. 
And, when they do come up with a plan or a costing type of model, 
I believe that their costs will be less, given the fact that they have 
not  had  carrier-of-last-resort  obligations  and  they  have  not  been 
regulated in the same fashion we have been through all the years. 
So, I think that is a possibility. 

Your  third  question,  as  to  what  effect  it  would  have  on  the  size 
of  the  Fund,  I  think  the  Fund  for  the  wireless  industry  would  be 
less  than  what  they’re  receiving  today,  based  on  the  identical  sup-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:14 May 07, 2012 Jkt 074012 PO 00000 Frm 00082 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74012.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

79 

port  rule.  As  I’ve  said,  the  identical  support  rule  is  illogical,  it’s 
based  on  our  costs,  not  on  the  costs  of  the  wireless  companies  and 
their cost of doing business. 

Senator STEVENS. Mr. Foxman? 
Mr.  FOXMAN.  Yes.  To  your  first  question,  ‘‘Should  both  wireless 
and wireline be supported?’’ I think the perspective on that should 
be  that  it’s  not  so  much  about  the  delivery  mechanism  as  it  is 
about the supported service, because, just as we’re having this dis-
cussion here today, a year from now, 2 years from now, there may 
be  a  new  technology  that’s  able  to  deliver  those  services  to  cus-
tomers,  too,  and  they  shouldn’t  be  excluded  from  the  public  inter-
est, for the benefit of the end-user, there shouldn’t be a restriction 
based  on  what  our  technology  and  delivery  mechanism  is.  So,  yes. 
And  tying  in,  I  guess,  with  the  second  question,  too,  about,  ‘‘Is 
it possible to do a model for wireless?’’ I think the issue of competi-
tive  neutrality  comes  up  in  that.  If  we  have  a  different  model  for 
each  different  kind  of  company  that  comes  and  proposes  to  deliver 
a  service,  how  long  does  that  take?  When  is  the  right  stage,  when 
a new technology is offered, to build that model? I think that would 
get very challenging to be able to manage. 

That  said,  we  certainly  could  come  up  with  a  model.  You  know, 
we,  as  operators,  know  our  own  costs,  and  I  don’t  think  we  would 
have problems sharing that information. 

As  it  relates  to  what  that  actually  means  for  the  size  of  the 
Fund,  and  what  our  costs  would  be,  I  think  a  complicating  issue 
there is, it really depends on what stage of development. So, if the 
public-interest  benefit  that  we’re  trying  to  get  to  is  building  net-
works in places that are underserved and have a great need today, 
the cost of doing that for any service provider can be very high. The 
cost  of,  for  example,  edging  out  a  new  network  into  more  rural 
places  is  one  thing,  the  cost  of  deploying  new  service,  wireless  or 
any  other  technology,  in  a  completely  underserved  area  is  going  to 
be much greater than that. 

Senator STEVENS. Mr. Lubin? 
Mr. LUBIN. Thank you. 
With  regard  to  the  first  part  of  the  question,  ‘‘Should  Universal 
Service  support  both  wired  and  wireless?’’  from  my  point  of  view, 
I  would  say  that  is  a  clear  public  policy  question  that  the  public 
policymakers must answer. If the answer is yes, then AT&T Wire-
less  will  be  very  eager  to  serve  those  rural  areas.  Just  as  we  are 
an ETC in five states today, we will be very eager. 

The question gets to be somewhat more complicated once a policy 
decision  is  reached  if  you  want  to  support  wireless,  and  that  is, 
what  is  most  critical.  I  believe  there  are  four  questions  to  be  an-
swered.  Do  you  want  it  supported?  If  the  answer  is  yes,  which  I 
assume it is, given this discussion, the next question is, what areas 
do  you  want  to  serve?  And  I  assume  it’s  the  underserved  rural 
areas.  And  so,  then  you  would  have  to  make  sure  that  we  have  a 
plan  that’s  designed  to  support,  truly,  the  underserved  areas.  The 
third  part  of  that  question  is,  am  I  going  to  support  one  CETC  or 
multiple  CETCs?  It’s  a  critical  question  to  be  answered.  And  the 
final question is, the identical support rule, do you want to use the 
same  cost  structure  as  the  incumbent?  Probably  the  same  cost 
structure  is  not  appropriate,  but  the  point  is,  once  you  answer  all

four questions, the final point is, do we have any idea how big the 
size of the Fund will be? Well, depending on how you answer these 
questions, the size of the Fund could become extremely large. That 
is  why  AT&T  has  put  a  pilot  on  the  table,  to  say,  ‘‘Let’s  begin  to 
learn, specifically, answering your specific questions.’’ 

And  the  final  point  here  is,  not  only  is  this  addressing  wireless, 
but  there  was  a  panel  here  about  a  month  or  two  ago  before  you 
talking  about  broadband  deployment.  So,  now  the  issue  is,  how 
much  funding  can  we  have,  and  how  much  are  customers  ulti-
mately going to pay? Because it’s all about what is seen on the cus-
tomer’s line of their bill. And so, ultimately, we’re going to have to 
answer  these  questions,  but  we’re  going  to  have  to  ultimately 
prioritize,  depending  on  how  big  the  size  of  the  Fund  gets,  if  we 
are  truly  interested  in  serving  underserved  areas,  which  AT&T  is, 
and that’s why we’ve put the two pilots on the table. 

Thank you. 
Senator STEVENS. Chief Flannery? 
Mr. FLANNERY. Well, Mr. Vice Chairman, I’m certainly not a pol-
icymaker in this discussion, but I will tell you how this looks from 
the law enforcement standpoint in the rural State of Maine. 

Should there be support for both in the Universal Service Fund? 
I  definitely  think  the  formula  needs  to  be  adjusted  to  take  care  of 
the  underserved  wireless  parts  of  rural  areas.  I  think  that  your 
comments,  made  earlier,  at  the  beginning,  that  the  FCC  had  the 
power beforehand to—Ms. Tate had said that she knows the issues 
and the problems that need to be addressed, but yet, there was no 
action taken to do that, but just to make this cap on primarily the 
wireless carriers. 

How  does  this  affect  us  in  the  State  of  Maine  to  accomplish  our 
homeland  security  initiatives?  It  pretty  much  handcuffs  us  to  do 
that. We’re currently, right now, working on being able to establish 
different training sessions to carry out mass casualty and mass dis-
asters in the area of central and northern Maine. And we’re having 
a  problem  right  now  identifying  areas  of  where  there’s  wireless 
service to implement and place our command posts for communica-
tions  to  be  able  to  get  weather  broadcasts  and  Internet  access.  So, 
you  can  see  that  that  portion  of  it  is  a  very  crucial  aspect  for  the 
State of Maine and other rural areas. 

So,  I  guess  the  question  is—the  model  to  calculate  should  be 
based  more  on  what  Mr.  Lubin  had  said  about  where  the  actual 
need  is,  and  identify  that.  Things  change  in  law  enforcement,  day 
in and day out, as much as they do at the FCC. And it’s important 
for you to prioritize and to recognize where your priorities are, and 
take action toward resolving these. I haven’t seen that done. 

Senator STEVENS. Well, thank you. 
I  just  want  to  ask  one  of  my  questions  and  then  let  the  other 
Senators  ask  questions,  and  I’ll  come  back  to  the  Senator  Inouye’s 
questions later. 

One  of  the  problems  I  have  with  this  situation  is  that  we  have, 
in these small communities, legacy carriers that are basically fixed- 
wire distribution hooked into satellite communications, in many in-
stances. The new wireless services are—those services, by the way, 
are  primarily  local  people  who  started  these  small  systems,  and 
have  improved  them  as  much  as  they  could  under  the  cir-

cumstances of the income that they’re receiving plus the Universal 
Service  support  they  get—when  the  wireless  services  come  in  and 
compete,  they  get  the  money  from  the  Universal  Service  Fund 
based  upon  the  legacy  carrier’s  costs.  And  there’s  a  windfall  there. 
But  with  the  windfall  comes  a  situation  where  they  destroy  the 
local  legacy  carrier  and  local  employment  is  gone,  the  local  invest-
ment’s  gone,  and  we  find  that  there’s  a  distant  carrier—in  terms 
of emergencies, they’re not there. 

How  do  you  answer  that?  Somehow  or  other,  I  think  we  have  to 
find  some  way  to  preserve  the  local  carriers,  where  they  perform 
more  of  a  service  than  just  delivering  a  hookup.  They  are  part  of 
the emergency system, the local legacy carrier, resident in the area, 
and  I  think  that  it’s  the  worst  problem  that  we  face,  along  comes 
a  new  carrier,  primarily  from  a  company  miles  away,  and  there’s 
no  attempt  to  restore  service  in  the  local  area  in  the  event  of  an 
emergency,  as  there  would  be  from  the  people  who  are  resident 
there  and  trying  to  restore  service.  Am  I  getting  across,  Mr.  Roo-
ney? 

Mr. ROONEY. Well, with all due respect, Senator, wireless service, 
at least in the experience that I’ve had, generally speaking, has re-
sponded to emergencies better than the wireline services. 

Senator  STEVENS.  How  far  away  is  your  wireless  service  com-

pared to where the people are? 

Mr. ROONEY. Well, can I talk about a prior life for a minute? 
Senator STEVENS. Sure. 
Mr.  ROONEY.  Because  Senator  Inouye  would  be  very,  very  famil-
iar  with  this.  But  in  a  prior  life,  when  Iniki  hit  Kaua‘i—the  com-
pany that I was president of was headquartered in Chicago—we ef-
fectively  were  the  only  telecommunications  supplier  up  and  oper-
ating in Kaua‘i through the hurricane and through its recovery pe-
riod.  The  landline  service  went  down,  and  the  other  wireless  serv-
ice went down. 

In  the  case  of  Missouri,  back  in  the  1990s,  when  they  had  the 
flooding that basically broke down every dam and berm in the area, 
our  wireless  service  was  serving  the  Red  Cross  and  other  places 
when the landline service was down. 

Excuse  me,  but  there’s  one  more  point.  In  current  service,  in 
New  England,  when  they  had  the  flooding  last  year,  and  in  Mis-
souri  again  this  year,  when  the  services  went  down,  we  operated, 
because  we’re  now  building  what  they  call  ‘‘hardened  sites.’’  And 
our engineers live in the communities that they work in, so the re-
pair  people,  the  people  that  service  these  places,  are  part  of  the 
communities  we  serve.  This  isn’t  like  having  guy  come  in  with  a 
satchel  and  put  up  a  terminal  and  then  walk  away  from  the  area 
that  they  serve.  I  think  wireless  basically  has  demonstrated,  time 
and  time  again,  its  viability  and  its  ability  to  operate  quickly  and 
over a period of time in service areas where there is trouble. 

Senator STEVENS. Well, I don’t want to prolong it, but I have the 
vision that the wireline services have local people involved, local in-
vestment, and the newcomers are basically from outside those com-
munities.  I  understand  what  you’re  saying,  during  an  emergency, 
but during just routine operation, I have the vision that, with these 
new  situations,  they  just  come  in  and  put  up  an  automated  thing 
somewhere  on  a  hill  near  the  community,  and  that’s  the  commu-

nications  service,  there’s  nobody  that  goes  with  it,  there’s  no  one 
local at all. 

Mr. ROONEY. With all due respect, that’s not the way we operate. 
Senator STEVENS. Is that true, Mr. Nishi? 
Mr. NISHI. I can’t speak to Mr. Rooney’s company, but I do know 
that, for the rural ILECs, we are in the communities we serve, we 
are part of the community. We’re proud to be a part of the commu-
nity, and we make contributions to the communities. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  I  won’t  prolong  this,  but  I’ll  get  back  to 
Senator  Inouye’s  questions.  I  believe  we  have  to  have  moderniza-
tion,  and  I  don’t  understand  this  cap,  on  the  CLECs,  because 
they’re  bringing  in  new  service,  and  not  having  any  caps  at  all  on 
existing  service.  On  the  other  hand,  I  do  not  understand  why  we 
should  take  away  from  the  smaller  communities  their  local  invest-
ment  and  their—the  people  who  have  pioneered  communications 
simply because someone else comes in under the existing rules and 
gets  paid  the  same  thing  that  the  wireline  service  carrier  gets,  in 
terms  of  Universal  Service  support  where  their  costs  are  so  much 
lower.  It’s  not  really  a  fair  competitive  advantage  that  they  have 
when they come into the community. 

Senator McCaskill? 
Senator MCCASKILL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I’d  like  to  ask  the  representatives—Mr.  Rooney  and  Mr.  Nishi 
and  Mr.  Foxman—if  any  of  your  companies  are  taking  advantage 
of  the  RUS  program  in  USDA,  the  program  to  expand  broadband 
service  that  is  available,  the  loan  program  that  is  available  there. 

Mr. ROONEY. I’m not aware that we are. 
Mr. FOXMAN. We’re not, either. 
Senator MCCASKILL. Mr. Nishi, is your company? 
Mr. NISHI. I know that there are various rural exchange carriers 
throughout the U.S. They are taking advantage of the plan. We are 
currently reviewing a lot of the rules and regulations with the plan 
to  see  if  there  are  ways  that  can  enhance  rural  carriers  to  make 
it more of a value to them. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  Could  any  of  you  explain  why  you  are  not 
utilizing  the  RUS  program  within  USDA  that  we  have  appro-
priated hundreds of millions of dollars to support? 

Mr.  ROONEY.  To  be  very  honest  with  you,  I  wasn’t  aware  of  it. 
Senator MCCASKILL. Yikes. OK. 
Mr.  FOXMAN.  I’ve  spent  a  little  bit  of  time,  and  we’re  inves-
tigating it. But, frankly, one of the challenges we’ve had is that it’s 
extremely  complicated  to  navigate,  so,  with  some  assistance,  we’re 
trying to do that now, but, frankly, struggling with it. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  Let  me  ask  you,  Mr.  Nishi,  if  we  got  rid  of 

the identical support rule, would you then oppose this cap? 

Mr. NISHI. I think getting rid of the identical support rule is key. 
And if we did get rid of the identical support rule, I’m not sure we 
would need a cap at this point in time. I do believe that a cap will 
spur people to really work on this issue. I think people are working 
on  this  issue  very  seriously  now,  given  everything  that’s  been  said 
in this hearing and in other hearings dealing with Universal Serv-
ice  funding.  We’re  taking  what  you’re  saying  very  seriously,  and 
what the Joint Board is saying very seriously. 

May I add one thing——

Senator MCCASKILL. Sure. 
Mr. NISHI.—in terms of what Mr. Rooney said regarding wireless 
networks?  One  thing  that  we  do—all  networks  are  interconnected. 
And  anytime  there  is  an  emergency,  for  wireless  service  to  be 
working, our networks are also working. And I do need to note that 
is because we do provide backhaul for many, many of their wireless 
cell sites. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  I  think  the  points  Mr.  Rooney  made  were 
good about wireless being there in times of natural disaster. I think 
a  lot  of  people  think  of  the  9-1-1  system  when  they  think  of  an 
emergency,  they  think  of  the  individuals  that  are  calling  for  help 
in an individual law enforcement setting. 

I  would  also  point  out  that  the  wireless  has  become  very  impor-
tant in terms of law enforcement because of the tracking capability 
of  cell  phones.  We  just  had  a  horrendous  abduction  and  murder  of 
a  young  woman  in  the  Greater  Kansas  City  area,  on  the  Kansas 
side of the line, and it was too late, but they were able to find her 
body quickly and apprehend the suspect because they were able to 
ping  her  phone.  So,  I  think  it’s  important  to  remember  that  the 
wireless  world  is  a  contributor,  in  terms  of  the  law  enforcement 
community.  And  I  think,  with  technology,  it’s  going  to  continue  to 
be  an  even  bigger  player  as  it  relates  to  the  more  traditional  role 
of  law  enforcement,  aside  from  the  kind  of  natural  disasters  that 
you  referred  to,  Mr.  Rooney,  in  terms  of  hurricanes  or  floods  or 
things of that nature. 

Mr.  ROONEY.  If  I  fell  into  a  ditch  in  the  middle  of  Missouri,  I’d 
sure  as  heck  be  very  grateful  that  I  had  E–911  service  that  could 
help find me. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  They  can  find  you,  in  terms  of  a  GPS  sys-
tem.  I  think  a  lot  of  Americans  don’t  realize  that  there  is  a  built- 
in GPS capability on their cell phones at this point. 

You’ve got my attention, Mr. Foxman, when you said ‘‘cost-plus.’’ 
That’s  like  for  me,  as  a  former  auditor,  that’s  like  fingernails  on  a 
blackboard. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  MCCASKILL.  And  that  term,  in  and  of  itself,  will  bring 
my  attention  back  to  whatever  is  being  said.  And  so,  I  would  like 
to ask questions of the other representatives of the companies that 
are  in  this  for  ultimately—I  mean,  we  have  to  be  honest  here—I 
know all of you want to talk about serving community first, but all 
of  you  have  to  make  a  profit,  you’re  in  business  to  make  a  profit, 
you wouldn’t be in business if you weren’t making a profit. And so, 
I  want  to  talk  to  the  other  reps  about  the  fact  that  we  have  no 
downward  pressure  whatsoever  on  the  average  cost  to  deploy,  the 
way  this  is  set  up.  Do  you  all  agree  with  Mr.  Foxman’s  analysis 
that the way this is set up right now, we are not incentivizing any-
one  to  try  to  do  this  at  the  lowest  cost  in  the  most  efficient  way? 

Mr. Rooney? 
Mr. ROONEY. I think my understanding of landline accounting is 
that it’s completely upside-down. You can go back a few years ago, 
when  the  Congress  was  trying  to  work  out  access  to  landline  serv-
ice,  and  deal  with  accounting  for  local  loops  and  TELRIC  and  all 
that kind of stuff. Instead of having a nice simple generally accept-
ed  accounting  principle  definition  of  costs,  you  went  through  tre-

84 

mendous law readings, and then, you know, you’d come up with an 
answer,  and  then  it  went  to  the  appellate  courts.  And,  you  know, 
landline  accounting  is  all  convoluted,  and  I  mean,  when  you  look 
at  the  accounting  that  we  use  for  our  cellular  business,  it’s  GAAP. 
So, what you see is what you get. And I’m perfectly willing to have 
everybody  use  GAAP  accounting  to  try  and  determine  what  the 
cost of deployment is. And, yes, it should be lowest-cost winner. 

Senator MCCASKILL. Mr. Nishi? 
Mr. NISHI. When Mr. Foxman referred to ‘‘cost-plus,’’ I’m assum-
ing that he means an adequate return on our investment. I can say 
that  when  we  build  networks,  we  build  them  as  efficiently  as  pos-
sible,  as  we  try  to  get  advanced  services  out  to  the  customers  we 
serve.  I  will  add  that,  since  the  cap  was  reindexed  in  2001,  and 
when  $2.5  billion  didn’t  come  to  the  rural  ILECs,  that  that  did  di-
rectly  impact  our  bottom  line  at  Waitsfield  and  Champlain  Valley 
Telecom.  We  had  to  make  hard  decisions  on  where  we  were  going 
to deploy our new networks. And, in fact, that’s one thing which— 
I  think  many  people  fail  to  realize  that  there’s  the  whole  issue  of 
sections  201  and  254,  and  the  sufficiency  principle,  and  affordable 
and  comparable  rates.  The  high-cost  loop-support  mechanism—in 
Vermont,  on  an  annual  basis,  we  send  out  a  letter  to  our  con-
sumers, saying, ‘‘Without such high-cost support funding, your rate 
would  be  such-and-such  dollars  higher.’’  So,  that  amount  we  have 
received from the Fund has gone to help keep local rates lower. So, 
it has impacted our operations over time. 

I’m not sure I got to the heart of your question, but—— 
Senator  MCCASKILL.  I  think  you  danced  a  little,  but  I’m  not 

going to hold you responsible for that. 

Yes, Mr. Lubin? 
Mr. LUBIN. Thank you. 
I’d  like  to  take  your  question  apart  a  little  bit,  because  a  lot  of 
things get said, and generalizations are being made, and I’d like to 
unpack it. 

Right  now,  the  ILECs,  incumbent  local  exchange  carriers,  are 
generating  roughly  $3  billion  of  the  $4  billion,  using  2006  values. 
Of that $3 billion, there’s something known as, let’s say, ‘‘nonrural 
companies,’’  who  are  getting  access  to  the  Universal  Service,  but 
under  a  different  set  of  rules.  These  are  generally  what  is  known 
as  price-cap  companies.  For  those  companies,  it  is  not  cost-plus.  It 
is  not.  Even  further,  if  one  of  those  companies  loses  a  line,  they 
lose  money.  Again,  a  point  that  was  somewhat  misleading  here 
today. 

Then,  there’s  $2  billion  of  the  $3  billion  that  go  to  rural  compa-

nies. 

Senator MCCASKILL. Right. 
Mr.  LUBIN.  Of  that  $2  billion,  $1  billion  of  it,  approximately,  is 
from  the  high-cost  loop  fund.  That  fund  is  capped.  And  if  lines  de-
cline,  the  aggregate  dollars  decline.  And  what  we’re  seeing  today 
in rural America, generally, is rural lines are declining, and the ag-
gregate is going down. 

The  rural  lines  may  be  declining  for  a  couple  of  reasons,  one  of 

which is second lines are declining because of broadband. 

Senator MCCASKILL. Right.

85 

Mr.  LUBIN.  And  you  have  some  wireless  substitution,  albeit  pos-
sibly  not  as  great  as  people  think,  because  the  growth  of  wireless 
is really another service, called mobility. We can debate that point, 
but  that’s  OK,  because  if  people  want  mobility,  right  now  that  is 
being allowed. But there’s another point of why mobility is growing 
so  much.  In  this  country,  21  percent  of  the  households  have  prob-
ably  three  or  four  wireless  connections.  So,  the  identical  support 
rule does have a problem. It has a problem, because it’s created off 
of  an  incumbent  LEC  that  doesn’t  have  21  percent  of  their  house-
holds  with  three  or  four  lines,  causing  the  overall  cost  to  poten-
tially go up. How much higher, we can debate all these things. 

Now,  what  about  the  remaining  $1  billion,  right?  Because  I  said 

there’s $3 billion, and I’ve now said, hey, there’s $1 billion. 

Senator MCCASKILL. Right. 
Mr.  LUBIN.  That  $1  billion  is  something  known  as  ‘‘cost-plus,’’ 
which is rate-of-return regulation. And I want to give you the plus 
and the minus of that. 

The minus could be, well, hey, there’s a mentality of you can put 

in more dollars. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  Right.  I  get  the  minus  part.  Give  me  the 

plus part. That’s what I’m asking—— 

Mr. LUBIN. I’ll give you the plus part. The plus part again, it all 
depends  where  you  stand  or  where  you  sit  whether  it’s  a  plus  or 
not,  but  the  rural  companies  have  been  doing  a  pretty  good  job— 
and  I  think  you  alluded  to  it  in  your  opening  statement,  whereby 
they’re  deploying  more  and  more  infrastructure  that  potentially 
could help them for broadband deployment. Some people would call 
that  a  plus,  some  people  may  say  that’s  not  a  plus.  But  the  point 
here  is,  if  we  think  broadband  deployment  is  a  good  national  goal, 
then they’ve got a mechanism in place that, in fact, is encouraging 
them  to  do  that.  Now,  whether  it’s  gold  plating,  that  issue  always 
comes  about,  and,  from  my  observation—I’ll  let  Roger  Nishi  speak 
to  it—these  companies  are  trying  to  figure  out  how  to  survive  in 
the  new  world  as  we  move  from  a  circuit-switched  world  into  a 
broadband  world  with  VoIP  application  and  many  other  applica-
tions. 

Senator MCCASKILL. Well, thank you for that. 
And  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  There  is  a  little  irony,  that  the 
plus  part  of  the  billion  that  you  referred  to  is  actually  not  part  of 
the legislative intent of this Fund, which is kind of what I alluded 
to before. Your explanation as to why the cost-plus part of the pro-
gram,  the  billion  dollars,  which  is,  you  know,  a  lot  of  money  that 
consumers  are  paying—is  helping  something  that,  frankly,  the 
RUS  program  is  supposed  to  be  helping,  but  this  money  wasn’t 
even designed to help. So, that just goes to the point that we’ve got 
to get at this broadbased reform in the whole area. 

Thank you all very much. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator  STEVENS.  You’re  absolutely  right,  Senator,  and  I  don’t 
think it can be solved without legislation. I’m not sure the FCC has 
the  power  to  reach  over  to  the  other  Department  and  say,  ‘‘You’ve 
got to coordinate with us and do it the way we say.’’ 

Senator Snowe?

Sheriff  Flannery,  I  thank  you  for  being  here  today,  and  I  want 
to  thank  you,  as  well,  for  your  29  years  of  service  to  the  State  of 
Maine  law  enforcement.  And  I  appreciate  your  views  here  today, 
because  I  think  it  does  give  the  dimension  of  the  realities,  you 
know,  on  the  ground  in  law  enforcement  and  homeland  security, 
which is of, obviously, our national interest. 

Can you speak to some of the realities of this technology gap, you 
know, between accident responses and domestic violence responses, 
for example? I know you’ve included that in some of your filed tes-
timony,  but  I  think  it  also  is  illustrative  of  the  problems  that  we 
face  in  the  areas  that  have  neither  subsidy  in  a  nonexistent  wire-
less service. 

Mr.  FLANNERY.  Right.  I  have  three  sons,  and  they’re  all  in  some 
type  of  public  service  or  another—one,  the  Army;  one,  the  Navy; 
and one’s a paramedic in Somerset County, which, as you’re aware, 
is just north of Kennebec County. Just before I came down to D.C., 
I spoke with my son, who is the paramedic up in Somerset County, 
and asked him ‘‘What is one of the biggest impacts on you, involv-
ing wireless service, and the lack thereof?’’ And, of course, he talks 
about  Route  201  coming  right  up  from  Skowhegan  all  the  way  up 
into  Jackman  and  the  Canadian  border,  having  accident  scenes 
there—and some of them are quite horrific, between tractor trailers 
with  logging  trucks  and  severe  recreational  accidents—not  being 
able to call the hospital to speak with the doctor in the emergency 
room  to  be  able  to  provide  them  with  information  on  the  injured 
party so that they can treat the patient the way the patient needs 
to be treated at that time. So, what they have to do is, they do the 
best  they  can  at  the  ground  level,  load  the  patient  up,  and  drive, 
if possible, to an area where they have cell service, so that they can 
communicate  with  the  hospital  as  to  what’s  going  on  with  the  pa-
tient.  And  I  will  tell  you  that,  at  times,  he  has  said  that  that  has 
made  a  difference  in  life  and  death.  And  we  should  be  resolving 
that problem when these people—there’s no reason not to. 

Senator SNOWE. Well, I—go ahead. 
Mr.  FLANNERY.  We’ve  had  numerous  hostage  situations  lately, 
where  the  hostage  negotiator  wants  to  be  able  to  establish  a  view 
of the residence or building where the hostages are located, so that 
he or she can see the scene as it’s playing out, while they’re negoti-
ating  with  the  subject  on  the  phone.  Many  times,  we  have  to  send 
that  hostage  negotiator  off,  you  know,  2  or  3  miles  up  and  down 
the  road  to  be  able  to  get  a  signal  to  talk  to  the  person  to  be  able 
to  commence  with  negotiations.  That’s  kind  of  a  ‘‘haphazard’’  way 
of  doing  things,  because  it  now  takes  that  hostage  negotiator  out 
of  seeing  what’s  going  on,  and  now  you  have  a  radio  in  one  ear, 
telephone  in  the  other,  to  try  to  see  what’s  going  on,  on  the  scene, 
with—you  have  to  mute,  and  as  you  can  see,  it  creates  a  major 
problem when things are happening at lightning speed. 

What’s  going  on  in  the  State  of  Maine  right  now  with  this,  is 
that  the  legislature  has  made  new  laws  allowing  for  private  busi-
ness  to  negotiate  and  work  with  the  State  government  on  working 
with  private  property,  their  own  property,  and  State  property,  to 
be  able  to  utilize  putting  up  wireless  information  systems  so  that 
the  entire  Department  of  Public  Safety  system  is  based  on  their 
MDTs, mobile data terminals, are based on wireless communication

through the cell phone service, and they have never had yet to get 
it to work because of the inefficiencies in the wireless system in the 
State  of  Maine.  So,  for  us  to  be  able  to  fulfill  our  obligations  of 
homeland security, we have reached an obstacle where we can’t do 
it  that  way.  Some  of  us  have  gone  with  radio  frequency  to  try  to 
get over that hurdle for now; but what that does, it limits you into 
your own system, not being able to get into outside systems, as far 
as  the  Internet  goes.  So,  it  helps  with  going  over  the  state’s  com-
munication system to check on wants and warrants for individuals, 
but  we’re  also  starting  to  eat  up  that  bandwidth,  because  the  only 
way we can access other services in the system—we can’t use wire-
less,  so  we  have  to  go  through  the  state’s  metro  system  to  be  able 
to  do  that,  so  there’s  a  big  caution  right  now  of  eating  up  all  that 
bandwidth.  So,  we’re  trying  to  get  around  it,  but  yet,  we’re  going 
to  hit  a  wall  here  eventually  on  that.  And  that’s  only  for  those 
areas  that  have  decent  wireless  service  in  their  communities. 
Aroostook County, as you well know, doesn’t. And they have a very, 
very  difficult  problem,  as  well  does  Somerset  County,  where  I  was 
talking  about  my  son.  He’s  had  opportunities  where  they’ve  been 
off-trail  into  ATV  or  snowmobile  accidents,  and  had  to  send  his 
partner up a hill to get a signal so that he could tell LifeFlight the 
GPS  coordinates,  so  they  could  fly  in  to  a  particular  area  to  pick 
up the patient. And, of course, all that takes time. 

One that really sticks in my mind, he told me about, was a raft-
ing  accident  on  Kennebec  River.  The  raft  turned  over,  everybody 
went  in  the  water.  One  person  had  swallowed  a  lot  of  water,  and 
the rafting guide got the person onshore, began CPR, and sent an-
other  rafter  off  to  the—there’s  no  cell  signal  there  on  the  water— 
so, sent him off to the road. No cell signal on the road. Stopped the 
first  car  coming  by  to  have  him  give  him  a  ride  to  the  next  house 
to  get  to  the  phone  line,  make  the  phone  call.  My  son  got  a  call 
45  minutes  later,  after  the  incident  happened,  arrives  there  20 
minutes later, and was unsuccessful in reviving the person. 

Senator  SNOWE.  Well,  I  appreciate  that.  And,  obviously,  I  think, 
your examples, I think, illustrates the point, frankly, that the lack 
of  wireless  service  is  not  just  mere  inconvenience,  it’s  a  matter  of 
life  and  death.  And,  obviously,  even,  you  know,  creating  perilous 
circumstances for our country with respect to homeland security, as 
we are trying to integrate that national response, as well, and that 
includes the rural areas of America. 

Mr.  Rooney,  your  plans  for  Maine—I  know—and  I  think  this  is 
indicative  of  the  other  states  in  which  you  serve—obviously,  are 
going  to  be  put  on  hold  as  a  result  of  this  cap,  as  I  understand, 
from what I’ve—— 

Mr. ROONEY. The new service would be. And one of the inequities 
of  the  cap  is  Maine  gets  hurt,  going  forward.  But  we  have  three 
states  that  we  serve—Illinois  would  be  eligible—if  they  froze  the 
cap—ineligible to—competitive communications operation would be 
eligible for $2,000 of funding, because that’s what they’ve got right 
now. And in Missouri it would be $120,000. This is the total. 

Senator SNOWE. Total. 
Mr.  ROONEY.  And  in  New  Hampshire,  where  Senator  Sununu’s 
from,  it’s  $103,000.  So,  there’s  inequity  between  the  states.  Each 
one  of  these  three  states,  by  the  way—when  we  look  at  going  into

these  areas,  we’re  going  into  what  I  call  ‘‘virgin  territory.’’  There 
isn’t  anybody—we’re  talking  about  where  there  is  no  cell  service. 
In some of the other States, like Washington and Oregon, it’s going 
to get complicated when analog service goes away, because a lot of 
the  areas  in  Maine,  when  we  built  the  system,  back  in  the  1980s, 
were set up for 3-watt bag phones. We don’t use 3-watt bag phones 
anymore. The phones that we have are six-tenths of a watt. Analog 
service  isn’t  being  supported  by  anybody  anymore,  so  that  goes 
away next year. And, effectively, now, to fill in those areas and pro-
vide  any  kind  of  service  that  would  be  called  reasonable,  we  have 
to  build  another  group  of  towers  to  effectively  fill  in  the  areas 
where  these  little  six-tenths-of-a-watt  phones  wouldn’t  reach.  So, 
there’s the capital requirements to sustain, and, especially in rural 
areas,  build  further,  are  very  significant,  and  I  think  you  know 
some of the areas in Maine. There’s not enough traffic on an ongo-
ing basis to justify a $350,000 investment. 

Senator  SNOWE.  I  appreciate  that,  and  I  appreciate  the  panel 
here  today.  And  I’d  say  that  this  is  a  matter  of  public  interest,  as 
well. I know that Commissioner Tate indicated that—hope that the 
industry  would  reach  a  consensus  on  some  of  the  questions,  and, 
obviously, the dimensions on identical support rule and so on. And 
I  think  that’s  a  real  issue,  as  to  whether  or  not  the  industry  is  in 
a position. But I happen to think that the cap is going to be a dis-
incentive  to  doing  that,  because  it’s  going  to  affect,  singularly,  one 
sector of the industry. 

Is  it  possible  to  reach  a  consensus  within  the  industry  on  this 

question, between wireless and wireline? Mr. Lubin, finally? 

Mr. LUBIN. Thank you. 
AT&T  possibly  is  in  a  unique  situation,  both  a  wired  company 
and  a  wireless  company.  And,  as  I  said  before,  we’re  currently  in 
five  States,  as  a  competitive  ETC  and  we  have  applications  in  five 
other States. And so, on one hand, we’re very eager to try to figure 
out how to get this done so that we can go in and put in the right 
infrastructure, be it for wireless. On the other side, the reason why 
AT&T  is  supporting  the  cap,  which  means  we’re  going  to  take 
money  away,  and  we’re  going  to  have  the  problem  that  Mr.  Roo-
ney’s  highlighting  in  selected  areas—by  the  way,  it  doesn’t  mean, 
since  we’re  going  to  still  get  some  money—there  are  some  places 
where  we  still  could  invest,  but  not  as  much  as  we  otherwise 
would. And so, the only reason AT&T, in my opinion, is supporting 
the cap is to figure out a long-term solution. So, now the issue that 
you’re  asking  is,  will  there  be  the  ability  to  reach  consensus?  I 
think  it’s  going  to  be,  (a)  difficult,  because  there’s  obviously  a  lot 
of  money  on  the  table,  and  (b)  if  there  is  no  cap,  my  fear  is,  we 
lose an opportunity, because we don’t get the parties to come to the 
table  with  real  passion  to  try  to  figure  out  a  compromise.  And 
that’s my fear, with it being uncapped. 

Bottom  line  is,  if  we  don’t  figure  out  a  long-term  solution,  we’ve 
just  lost  one  super  opportunity  to  try  to  figure  out  how  to  really 
get  the  money,  as  Mr.  Flannery  highlights,  into  the  underserved 
areas,  if  that’s  what  the  public  policy  decisionmakers  elect  to  do. 

Senator SNOWE. OK. 
Yes, Mr. Foxman, yes, very quickly. 
Mr. FOXMAN. Very—sorry, I just——

Senator SNOWE. Yes, thank you. 
Mr.  FOXMAN.—wanted  to  respectfully  disagree  that  I  think  that 
the nature of the cap accomplishes the exact opposite. If we wanted 
to  fix  the  problem  properly,  then—everyone  works  best  with  a 
deadline—put  the  pressure  on  the  Commission,  on  the  industry, 
whoever, to get it done. 

Senator SNOWE. Yes, because it’s not balanced, as it stands. And, 
frankly—hopefully,  the  industry  would,  but  certainly  FCC’s  action 
shouldn’t be predicated on that, and should, defer this rule and try 
to reach an agreement. 

Senator STEVENS. We’re going to have to call it off. I don’t know 
if you realize it, the President’s coming up. The halls will be closed 
soon. And we have to get back to the Capitol before the doors close. 
So, I do appreciate very much your appearances here today, and 
I think we all have a better understanding of the problem. I’m not 
sure  we’ve  got  the  solution,  but  we  understand  the  problem. 
Thanks for your courtesy in coming and joining us today. 

We  will  submit  the  Chairman’s  questions  and  the  ones  I  would 
ask.  They’re  very  few.  I  would  ask  you  to  respond  to  them,  if  you 
will, please. 

Thank you very much. 
[Whereupon, at 12:20 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
Today the Committee revisits a familiar topic: Universal Service. 
More  than  a  decade  ago,  in  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996,  as  a  Congress, 
we made clear that we are committed to the principle of Universal Service. We stat-
ed that in all regions of the nation—rural, urban and everywhere in between—con-
sumers  are  entitled  to  comparable  services  at  comparable  rates.  The  Federal  Com-
munications  Commission  was  charged  with  translating  this  lofty  principle  into  con-
crete action. To do so, they set up the Universal Service Fund. 

But  today,  that  fund  faces  some  difficult  challenges.  If  the  Fund  continues  to  ex-
pand  at  its  current  pace,  some  say  we  may  jeopardize  Universal  Service  itself.  In-
cumbent  carriers  urge  us  to  place  limits  on  the  ability  of  other  carriers  to  access 
these funds. How is it feasible, they ask, for the Universal Service Fund to support 
so many different carriers serving so few customers in rural areas? 

Still  other  carriers,  many  of  them  wireless  providers,  ask  if  it  is  fair  to  reduce 
support  that  may  be  necessary  to  serve  large  swaths  of  rural  America.  In  order  to 
provide comparable services at comparable rates, they say they need access to these 
funds. 

Last  month,  the  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service  weighed  in  on 
this  matter.  It  recommended  that  the  Commission  cap  the  amount  of  funds  avail-
able  to  competitive  providers  as  an  interim  measure,  pending  broader  Universal 
Service reform. 

In  the  end,  we  cannot  let  short-term  proposals  free  us  from  the  need  to  address 
long-term  reform.  If  comprehensive  reform  requires  a  more  vigorous  review  of  the 
identical support rule or any other aspect of existing policy, we should proceed down 
that road. After all, ensuring the long-term sufficiency and stability of the Universal 
Service Fund means ensuring that all of our citizens have the communications capa-
bilities they need to compete in the global economy.

I. Introduction and Summary 

92 

Comspan is a wireline competitive local exchange carrier (‘‘CLEC’’) and a competi-
tive  eligible  telecommunications  carrier  (‘‘CETC’’)  delivering  broadband  voice,  data, 
and  video  services  to  rural  communities  and  small  towns  in  the  State  of  Oregon. 
Through  its  state-of-the-art  fiber-to-the-home  (‘‘FTTH’’)  networks,  Comspan  is  ful-
filling the central goals of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the ‘‘Act’’) 3 by bring-
ing  competition,  higher  quality  services,  lower  prices,  and  the  rapid  deployment  of 
innovative  telecommunications  technologies  to  Oregon  markets.4 And  significantly, 
Comspan is directly addressing the Universal Service goals of the Act by delivering 
these  services  to  those  high-cost  areas  of  the  state  that  have  largely  been  ignored 
by  the  incumbent  local  exchange  carriers  (‘‘ILECs’’)  and  the  local  cable  companies.5 
Comspan  has  already  completed  FTTH  networks  in  two  Oregon  cities  and  has 
plans  to  build  networks  in  an  additional  ten  small  towns  and  rural  communities 
throughout  the  state  within  the  next  year.  However,  Comspan  cannot  fund  the  sub-
stantial  capital  needs  of  these  fiber  builds  without  support  from  the  Federal  Uni-
versal Service Fund (the ‘‘Fund’’).6 Accordingly, if the temporary caps recommended 
by the Joint Board are adopted by the Commission, Comspan’s expansion plans will 
be  stopped  in  their  tracks,  and  citizens  in  Oregon’s  underserved  communities  will 
be  denied  precisely  those  benefits  and  services  that  the  Act  was  intended  to  pro-
mote. 

It is a fundamental premise of the Act that competition and Universal Service are 
mutually  supportive  and  reinforcing  goals.7 With  this  understanding,  the  Commis-
sion  has  held  ‘‘competitive  neutrality’’  as  a  guiding  principle  in  implementing  Uni-
versal  Service.  In  the  face  of  the  pressure  of  a  growing  Fund,  the  Joint  Board  is 
now  asking  the  Commission  to  abandon  the  principle  of  competitive  neutrality  by 
adopting caps that favor the incumbent local exchange carriers and are likely to put 
many CETCs out of business. 

Comspan  recognizes  that  the  Fund  is  growing  at  an  unsustainable  pace  and  that 
reform is necessary. However, wireline broadband CETCs such as Comspan are the 
solution—not the problem. These carriers are serving high-cost communities in effi-
cient and effective manners. If the FCC adopts a permanent solution that eliminates 
carriers  such  as  Comspan  from  the  marketplace—if  the  FCC  denies  carriers  such 
as Comspan equal access to the same high-cost support as is available to the incum-
bents—it  will  have  sacrificed  the  goals  of  the  Act  in  order  to  achieve  a  quick,  and 
ultimately ineffective, fix. 

Comspan  therefore  urges  the  Commission  to  reject  the  Joint  Board’s  proposed 
caps and instead act to adopt mechanisms for reforming the Universal Service that 
preserve  the  ability  of  CETCs  to  continue  to  draw  support  from  the  Fund  on  the 
same  terms  as  the  ILECs,  and  by  so  doing,  to  continue  to  encourage  the  provision 
of advanced services to all citizens. 
II. ComspanUSA 
A. History of the Company 

Comspan  is  a  wireline  competitive  local  exchange  carrier  headquartered  in 
Roseburg, Oregon—a small town in southern Oregon. Comspan was formed in 2002 
by  a  group  of  local  business  people  intent  on  providing  a  competitive  alternative  to 
the incumbent local exchange carrier, Qwest Communications (‘‘Qwest’’). Five years 
later,  Comspan  provides  local  exchange  and  long  distance  service  to  a  significant 
percentage  of  the  households  in  Roseburg,  and  in  the  neighboring  communities  of 
Sutherlin and Winston as well. 

Based  on  its  experience  in  Roseburg,  Comspan  became  convinced  that  it  could 
offer  advanced  telecommunications  services  to  Oregonians  living  in  small  towns 
throughout  the  state,  and  that  it  could  offer  these  services  at  affordable  prices.  In 
order  to  realize  its  plan,  Comspan  teamed  up  with  the  LTS  Group  of  Companies 
(‘‘LTS’’),  which  serve  the  telecommunications,  utilities,  and  industrial  sectors  in 
Canada  and  the  United  States.  LTS’s  network  development  arm  specializes  in  sys-
tem  designs  and  development  of  ‘‘triple  play’’  networks,  delivering  voice,  data,  and 
television  services.  Together,  the  two  companies  have  embarked  on  an  ambitious 
plan  to  construct,  deploy  and  manage  FTTH  networks  in  small  towns  and  rural

areas  throughout  Oregon.  LTS  has  since  purchased  Comspan,  lending  the  company 
LTS’s significant financial strength and technical expertise. 
B. Bandon and Coquille 

After some preliminary market research, Comspan chose to deploy its first FTTH 
network  in  Bandon,  Oregon.  Bandon  is  a  town  with  a  population  of  approximately 
3,100  residents  located  on  the  Southern  Oregon  coast,  and  Comspan’s  preliminary 
market research revealed that it was an underserved area. Although the local ILEC 
did advertise DSL services, Comspan received reports that approximately 50 percent 
of  the  households  lived  too  far  from  the  ILEC  central  office  to  be  eligible  for  DSL. 
And the local cable company made it known that it had no plans to upgrade its net-
work  to  allow  it  to  offer  broadband  services  to  Bandon  for  another  20  years.8 For 
these reasons, Comspan determined that Bandon was a perfect spot to test its mar-
ket strategy. 

Comspan  broke  ground  on  the  project  in  February  2006,  and  turned  up  its  first 
customer  in  August  2006.  The  Bandon  network  is  built  around  a  central  office  and 
video  head-end  located  in  Bandon,  connected  to  approximately  90  percent  of  the 
households  in  Bandon  via  Comspan’s  passive  optical  network  (‘‘PON’’).  Over  this 
state-of-the-art  architecture,  Comspan  offers  Bandon’s  citizens  not  only  basic  local 
exchange  and  long  distance  service,  but  high-speed  data 9 and  video  as  well.  And 
Bandon’s  citizens  have  welcomed  Comspan’s  services  with  open  arms.  In  less  than 
a  year,  Comspan  now  serves  a  full  35  percent  of  the  households  in  Bandon,  and  is 
gaining  new  customers  every  day.  The  company  expects  to  achieve  a  50  percent 
market share by mid summer and a 65 percent market share within 2 years. 

Once  the  network  in  Bandon  was  completed,  Comspan  immediately  began  build-
ing  in  Coquille—a  slightly  larger  town  of  approximately  5,000,  located  about  17 
miles  away.  Like  Bandon,  Coquille  residents  had  few  choices  when  it  came  to 
broadband  services.  The  local  ILEC  offers  DSL  but  only  to  those  households  close 
in  to  the  central  office,  while  the  local  cable  company  neither  offers  nor  has  plans 
to offer broadband services in the foreseeable future. It is not surprising, then, that 
Comspan has had remarkable success ‘‘preselling’’ its services in Coquille. The com-
pany expects to turn up its first customers in Coquille this month. 

Based  upon  its  success  in  Bandon  and  Coquille,  in  the  next  12  months  Comspan 
is  planning  to  begin  building  FTTH  networks  in  an  additional  10  small  towns  lo-
cated across the state. 
C. The Role of Universal Service Funding in Comspan’s Plans 

Small  towns  like  Bandon  and  Coquille  are  significantly  less  dense  than  mid-to- 
large cities, and are therefore costlier to serve. Moreover, because the customer pool 
is small, it is impossible to achieve the same economies of scale associated with cit-
ies  with  larger  populations.  Thus,  from  the  beginning,  Comspan  has  depended  on 
anticipated  support  from  the  state  and  Federal  Universal  Service  funds  in  order  to 
build  its  FTTH  networks.  Accordingly,  Comspan  applied  for  and  received  Federal 
ETC  status  in  Bandon  and  Coquille  in  order  to  use  the  relatively  modest,  but  not 
insignificant, funding to help to pay for the infrastructure essential for the delivery 
of  basic  voice  services  in  those  communities.  It  has  also  applied  for  ETC  status  in 
the nearby communities of Reedsport, Veneta, Myrtle Creek and Oakridge, and will 
file additional applications as it prepares to build-out additional cities. 

The  continued  availability  of  Fund  support  is  critical  to  Comspan’s  ability  to  de-
liver its advanced services to underserved communities throughout Oregon. Indeed, 
if Universal Service funding becomes unavailable to Comspan, or if it is significantly 
diminished  from  current  levels,  Comspan  will  be  unable  to  complete  its  expansion 
plans  beyond  those  communities  it  is  currently  serving.  The  elimination  of  CETCs 
such  as  Comspan—who  are  providing  advanced  broadband  services—would  con-
stitute a real loss to consumers in small towns and rural communities who will oth-
erwise  have  only  limited  (if  any)  access  to  broadband.  Indeed,  wireline  broadband 
CETCs  like  Comspan,  more  than  those  of  any  other  class  of  ETC,  serve  the  goals 
of the Act and should be ensured continued Fund support: 

• First,  Comspan  is  bringing  new  technologies  to  small  towns  and  rural  areas. 
The Act specifically declares: ‘‘Access to advanced telecommunications and infor-
mation services should be provided in all regions of the Nation.’’ 10 By providing 

8 Since  that  time,  the  cable  company  is  now  estimating  it  will  be  in  a  position  to  provide 

broadband services in 3, not 20, years. 

9 Comspan’s  network  offers  commercial  data  speeds  of  up  to  7  mbps,  with  technical  capabili-

ties of 100 mbps.

94 

state-of-the-art, fiber-based voice, video and high-speed data, Comspan is doing 
precisely  that—and  importantly,  Comspan  is  delivering  these  new  technologies 
in areas of the country that would not otherwise receive these services. And the 
benefits  of  these  services  can  make  a  remarkable  difference  in  these  commu-
nities.  The  availability  of  true  broadband  brings  with  it  opportunities  for  ad-
vances  in  healthcare  through  telemedicine  applications,  educational  opportuni-
ties through e-learning applications, and economic development. 

• Second,  Comspan  encourages  competition  in  small  towns  and  rural  areas.  In 
adopting the Act, Congress did not call for a two-tier society that promotes com-
petition in large urban markets, while monopolies retain their grasp on Ameri-
cans living in small towns. On the contrary, Congress envisioned that all Ameri-
cans  would  reap  the  benefits  of  competition  in  local  telecommunications  mar-
kets.  Comspan  is  fulfilling  the  Act’s  vision  of  competition  for  rural  Americans. 
• Third,  Comspan  services  compete  head-to-head  with  and  serve  as  complete  sub-
stitutes  for  ILEC  services.  That  is,  when  a  consumer  purchases  Comspan  serv-
ice,  that  consumer  will  drop  the  ILEC  service.  Thus,  the  support  provided  to 
CETCs such as Comspan would not cause the Fund to increase at all if the cur-
rent system did not provide continued support to the ILEC even after the ILEC 
loses the customer. 

III. The Joint Board’s Proposed Caps 

The  Joint  Board’s  proposal  to  cap  high-cost  support  to  CETCs  represents  an  ex-
treme  and  unwarranted  departure  from  the  Commission’s  principle  of  competitive 
neutrality  in  the  implementation  of  Universal  Service,  and  should  therefore  be  re-
jected. 
A.  The  Proposed  Caps  Violate  the  Act’s  Principle  of  Competitive  Neutrality  and 

Thereby Subvert the Act’s Pro-Competitive Goals 

The Act expressly rejects the previously-held belief that telecommunications serv-
ices are natural monopolies, best delivered by a single incumbent carrier.11 In draft-
ing  the  Act,  Congress  instead  offered  the  vision  of  a  vibrant  marketplace  in  which 
carriers compete with one another to bring to customers the latest technological in-
novations at the lowest cost. And while Universal Service remains an equally impor-
tant  goal,  it  was  never  intended  to  be  furthered  at  the  cost  of  competition.  On  the 
contrary,  competition  and  new  technologies  were  expected  to  further  the  goals  of 
Universal  Service  as  they  would  ‘‘greatly  reduce  the  actual  costs  of  providing  Uni-
versal Service over time.’’ 12 

In implementing the Act, the Commission has remained true to this vision. In its 
First Report and Order,13 the Commission declared ‘‘competitive neutrality’’ a ‘‘guid-
ing principle’’ for the preservation and advancement of Universal Service. The Com-
mission stated: 

‘‘Universal  Service  support  mechanisms  and  rules  should  be  competitively  neu-
tral.  In  this  context,  competitive  neutrality  means  that  Universal  Service  sup-
port mechanisms and rules neither unfairly favor nor disfavor one provider over 
another and neither unfairly favor one technology over another.’’ 14 

The  Commission  not  only  adopted  competitive  neutrality  as  ‘‘an  additional  prin-
ciple’’  under  254(b),  but  it  also  found  the  principle  to  be  embodied  in  several  of  the 
Act’s  explicit  requirements—including  254(e)’s  requirement  that  Universal  Service 
support be explicit, section 254’s requirement that state Universal Service contribu-
tions be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and section 214(e)’s requirement that any 
carrier  can  become  an  eligible  telecommunications  carrier  if  it  meets  certain  statu-
tory  criteria.15 Accordingly,  the  Commission  found  that  ‘‘an  explicit  recognition  of 
competitive neutrality in the collection and distribution of funds and the determina-
tion  of  eligibility  in  universal  support  mechanisms  is  consistent  with  Congressional 
intent  and  necessary  to  promote  a  ‘pro-competitive,  deregulatory  national  policy 
framework.’ ’’ 16

The Commission certainly recognized that strict adherence to the principle of com-
petitive  neutrality  would  be  difficult  to  achieve,  even  suggesting  that  there  would 
be times when disparities between types of carriers would exist. However, the impli-
cation  was  that  these  disparities  would  be  small  and  would  exist  only  where  they 
could not be eliminated. The Commission explained: 

‘‘Our decisions here are intended to minimize departures from competitive neu-
trality,  so  as  to  facilitate  a  market-based  process  whereby  each  user  comes  to 
be  served  by  the  most  efficient  technology  and  carrier.  We  conclude  that  com-
petitively  neutral  rules  will  ensure  that  such  disparities  are  minimized  so  that 
no  entity  receives  an  unfair  competitive  advantage  that  may  skew  the  market 
place or inhibit competition by limiting the available quantity of services or re-
stricting the entry of potential service providers.’’ 17 

In  contrast,  the  Joint  Board’s  recommended  caps  are  like  throwing  a  hand  gre-
nade at a kidnapper. You may stop the kidnapper, but at too great a cost. Similarly, 
the  caps  may  halt  the  growth  of  the  fund,  but  they  are  also  likely  to  inflict  severe 
damage  on  CETCs  such  as  Comspan.  And,  in  so  doing,  they  will  subvert  the  Act’s 
pro-competitive goals. 
B. The Proposed Caps Are Likely to Drastically Reduce the Amount of Support Avail-

able to CETCs Such as Comspan 

The Joint Board proposes to cap total support to CETCs, by state, at the amount 
distributed in 2006. So, as the number of lines served by CETCs grows in any state, 
the  amount  of  per-line  support  will  decrease.  It  is  impossible  for  Comspan  to  cal-
culate  with  precision  how  much  the  caps  may  reduce  the  support  available  to  it  in 
Oregon.  That  said,  Comspan  has  analyzed  publicly  available  information  in  order 
to make a good faith estimate. The results are alarming. 

According  to  the  Universal  Service  Administrative  Company  (‘‘USAC’’),  Oregon 
CETCs  were  the  recipients  of  approximately  $10  million  in  high-cost  support  in 
2006.18 However,  two  new  carriers—Cingular  and  Eagle  Telephone—were  certified 
by the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (‘‘OPUC’’) in late 2006 and early 2007; 19 
in that same time period, Comspan received ETC certification in two new wire cen-
ters  in  the  state.20 In  forecasts  provided  to  USAC,  Oregon  CETCs  have  projected 
that by the third quarter of 2007 they will receive over double the amount received 
by  CETCs  in  2006,  assuming  current  support  levels.21 In  other  words,  Oregon 
CETCs  are  projecting  that  they  will  more  than  double  their  number  of  lines  over 
the  first  three  quarters  of  2007.  If  the  caps  are  adopted  and  the  total  amount  dis-
tributed  remains  constant,  then  the  per-line  support  received  by  the  CETCs  in  Or-
egon  will  be  less  than  half  of  what  it  is  now.  And  if  history  is  any  predictor,  the 
disparity will continue to grow as these CETCs gain a foothold in the high-cost mar-
kets. 

As  discussed  above,  a  significant  level  of  support  is  necessary  in  order  for 
Comspan  to  fund  the  substantial  initial  cash  outlay  required  for  building  its  FTTH 
infrastructure  in  new  markets.  Comspan’s  decision  to  enter  new  markets  depends 
on  the  availability  of  that  support.  Comspan  certainly  cannot  sustain  its  business 
plan with the cuts in support that these estimates suggest. 

Moreover,  even  if  the  amount  of  funding  under  the  caps  were  sufficient  to  allow 
Comspan to move forward, the market would be tilted more steeply against it. Com-
petitive local exchange carriers always face an uphill battle, as they compete against 
ILECs  who  enjoy  all  of  the  advantages  of  incumbency.  If,  in  addition  to  all  of  the 
natural  advantages,  the  incumbent  LECs  were  also  entitled  to  twice  as  much  USF 
support  than  the  CETCs,  then  Comspan’s  ability  to  compete  will  be  burdened  fur-
ther.

The  Joint  Board  has  attempted  to  minimize  the  harm  that  its  proposed  caps 
might  produce  by  pointing  out  that  the  caps  are  intended  to  be  temporary.22 How-
ever,  in  view  of  the  complexity  of  the  issues  involved,  it  seems  unlikely  that  the 
Commission will have lifted them in favor of permanent mechanisms within the 18 
months projected in the Recommended Decision. Given what would be an at-best un-
certain  situation,  it  is  reasonable  to  imagine  that,  if  the  caps  are  adopted,  many 
CETCs will either halt their expansion plans, as projected by Comspan, or exit high- 
cost markets altogether. 
C. Customers Will Lose if the CETCs Are Eliminated 

It should be abundantly clear that competition in high-cost areas is good for con-
sumers.  Competitive  ETCs  such  as  Comspan  are  bringing  a  variety  of  advanced 
services  to  underserved  areas—thereby  introducing  new  technology  and  innovative 
services  to  customers  who  would  otherwise  have  no  such  access.  Moreover, 
Comspan’s  own  experience  in  Bandon  illustrates  just  how  effective  competition  can 
be,  even  in  rural  areas,  at  spurring  the  incumbent  LECs  and  cable  companies  to 
upgrade  their  own  networks.  As  mentioned  above,  before  Comspan  announced  its 
intention  to  enter  the  Bandon  market,  the  local  cable  provider  had  no  intention  of 
upgrading its facilities to allow it to offer broadband services for twenty years. After 
having lost significant market share to a competitor, that same company is now esti-
mating that it will be able to provide Bandon with cable modem services in 3 years. 
If  the  Commission  adopts  the  caps  proposed  by  the  Joint  Board  in  its  Rec-
ommended  Decision,  Comspan  and  other  CETC’s  like  Comspan  will  be  damaged. 
However,  the  real  losers  will  be  the  customers  in  those  Oregon  communities  that 
Comspan plans to serve—customers who now have a chance to enjoy the same tech-
nological  advantages  as  customers  in  larger  cities—who  instead  will  have  to  wait 
up to 20 years to come into the 21st century. 
IV. Conclusion 

Comspan  appreciates  this  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  Recommended  Decision 

and looks forward to providing additional comments in the future.

IX. Conclusion 
I. Introduction and Summary 

The National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates (‘‘NASUCA’’) 1 files 
these comments to support the recommendation of the Federal-State Joint Board on 
Universal  Service  (‘‘Joint  Board’’)  that  the  Federal  Communications  Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’  or  ‘‘FCC’’)  take  immediate  action  to  impose  an  interim,  emergency 
cap on the amount of high-cost support that competitive eligible telecommunications 
carriers  (‘‘CETCs’’)  may  receive.2 This  is  necessary,  in  the  Joint  Board’s  words,  ‘‘to 
rein  in  the  explosive  growth  in  high-cost  Universal  Service  support  disburse-
ments.’’ 3 The Commission seeks comment on the Joint Board’s recommendation.4 

The NPRM is on an extremely tight timeline.5 But that is justified by the ‘‘emer-
gency’’  in  which  the  USF  finds  itself.6 Unfortunately,  the  emergency  is,  in  part, 
caused  by  the  failure  of  the  Commission  and  of  the  Joint  Board  to  act  in  a  coordi-
nated  fashion  on  many  of  the  issues  that  have  previously  been  put  out  for  com-
ment.7 But  that  does  not  alleviate  the  need  for  a  cap  on  the  high-cost  Universal 
Service Fund (‘‘USF’’) like that recommended by the Joint Board. 
II. The Joint Board Recommendation and Issues for Comment 

The  Joint  Board  recommended  that  the  Commission  cap  the  amount  of  support 
that CETCs may receive for each state based on the average level of CETC support 
distributed  in  that  state  in  2006.8 The  Joint  Board  further  recommended  that  the 
interim  cap  apply  until  1  year  from  the  date  that  the  Joint  Board  makes  its  rec-
ommendation  regarding  comprehensive  and  fundamental  high-cost  Universal  Serv-
ice reform.9 

The  Commission  seeks  comment  on  the  Joint  Board’s  recommendations.10 The 
Commission  asks  commenters  to  ‘‘address  whether  the  Commission  should  control 
the  growth  of  high-cost  support  by  capping  support  on  CETCs  as  recommended  by 
the Joint Board.’’ 11 The Commission also asks ‘‘parties to address the Joint Board’s 
recommendation to limit the cap to CETCs only, and whether there are public inter-
est  concerns  that  warrant  modifying  the  application  of  the  recommendation  to  pro-
viders of certain services.’’ 12 

The Commission also asks for comment on the Joint Board’s recommendations re-
garding the ‘‘operation of any interim cap, including the duration of the cap, its ap-
plication,  and  the  base  period  for  the  cap.’’ 13 The  Joint  Board  had  recommended 
that  the  duration  of  the  cap  be  1  year  from  the  date  of  any  Joint  Board  rec-
ommended  decision  on  comprehensive  Universal  Service  reform,  which  the  Joint 
Board  committed  to  issue  within  6  months  of  May  1,  2007.14 The  Commission  also 
seeks comment ‘‘on the Joint Board’s recommendation to impose the cap on a state- 
by-state basis . . .’’ 15 The Joint Board had recommended that the cap be set at the 
level of support received by CETCs in 2006 . . .’’ 16 
III. Capping the Fund as an Interim Step Is Necessary 

The  Joint  Board  presents  more-than-adequate  justification  for  placing  an  emer-

gency cap on the fund: 

High-cost  support  has  been  rapidly  increasing  in  recent  years  and,  without  im-
mediate action to restrain growth in competitive ETC funding, the Federal Uni-
versal  Service  Fund  is  in  dire  jeopardy  of  becoming  unsustainable.  Today,  the 
Universal  Service  Fund  provides  approximately  $4  billion  per  year  in  high-cost 
support.  Yet,  in  2001,  high-cost  support  totaled  approximately  $2.6  billion.  In 
recent  years,  this  growth  has  been  due  to  increased  support  provided  to  com-
petitive  ETCs  which  receive  high-cost  support  based  on  the  per-line  support 
that the incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) receive rather than the com-
petitive  ETC’s  own  costs.  While  support  to  incumbent  LECs  has  been  flat  or 
even  declined  since  2003,  by  contrast,  in  the  6  years  from  2001  through  2006, 
competitive ETC support grew from $15 million to almost $1 billion—an annual 
growth  rate  of  over  100  percent.  Based  on  current  estimates,  competitive  ETC 
support in 2007 will reach at least $1.28 billion if the Commission takes no ac-
tion  to  curtail  this  growth.  Moreover,  if  the  Commission  were  now  to  approve 
all  competitive  ETC  petitions  currently  pending  before  the  Commission,  high- 
cost support for competitive ETCs could rise to as much as $1.56 billion in 2007. 
High-cost support to competitive ETCs is estimated to grow to almost $2 billion

98 

in  2008  and  $2.5  billion  in  2009  even  without  additional  competitive  ETC  des-
ignations in 2008 and 2009.17 

The impact on consumers across the Nation of this growth in the Fund is substan-
tial.  The  current  USF  contribution  factor  is  11.7  percent.18 All  other  things  being 
equal,  if  the  disbursements  to  CETCs  grew  to  the  cited  $1.56  billion  for  2007,  the 
contribution  factor  would  grow  to  11.9  percent.19 The  Joint  Board’s  estimate  does 
not take into account all of the CETC designations pending in the various states,20 
which  likely  outweigh  those  pending  at  the  Commission.  Consumers  cannot  be 
asked to bear this burden. 
IV. Applying the Cap Only to CETCs Is Reasonable 

As  quoted  above,  the  Joint  Board  correctly  notes  that  in  recent  years  the  growth 
in  the  Fund  is  almost  entirely  attributable  to  CETCs:  ‘‘While  support  to  incumbent 
LECs  has  been  flat  or  even  declined  since  2003,  by  contrast,  in  the  6  years  from 
2001  through  2006,  competitive  ETC  support  grew  from  $15  million  to  almost  $1 
billion—an  annual  growth  rate  of  over  100  percent.’’ 21 Therefore,  the  most  direct 
way  to  deal  with  the  growth  in  the  Fund  as  an  interim  measure  is  to  limit  the 
source of growth: CETCs. 

We  are  likely  to  hear,  and  we  have  already  heard,  from  those  who  would  be  im-
pacted—namely wireless carriers—that capping the Fund for CETCs is not competi-
tively  neutral.22 We  have  also  heard  that  capping  the  Fund  for  CETCs  would  dis-
courage wireless carriers’ deployment of services in rural areas.23 

With regard to the first point, it should first be recalled that the principle of com-
petitive  neutrality  is  not  found  in  Section  254.  It  was  derived  by  the  Commission 
based  on  its  ability  to  adopt  ‘‘additional  principles’’  pursuant  to  47  U.S.C. 
254(b)(7).24 Depending  on  the  context,  one  principle  may  be  important  enough  to 
trump any or all the other principles.25 In this situation, the need for ‘‘specific, pre-
dictable  and  sufficient’’  support 26 can  override  the  derived  principle  of  competitive 
neutrality. As the Joint Board has found, ‘‘sufficient’’ also implies ‘‘no more than suf-
ficient.’’ 27 Further, incumbent LECs have had their support from the high-cost loop 
fund capped since the 1990s. Thus additional support for CETCs can be put tempo-
rarily ‘‘on hold’’ without violating the Act. 

Likewise, with regard to the second point, while it is likely that the receipt of Uni-
versal  Service  funds  eases  wireless  carriers’  deployment  of  services  in  rural  areas, 
many  carriers  were  and  have  been  deploying  wireless  facilities  without  such  sup-
port. The impact of a temporary cap on wireless funding while other USF issues are 
being resolved is speculative; the impact on consumers of the increased funding that 
will occur without a cap is definite. 

The speculative impact of a cap is reinforced by the fact that the Joint Board rec-
ommended  that  the  Commission  consider  ‘‘abandoning  or  modifying’’  the  so-called 
identical support or portability rule.28 The Joint Board correctly notes that the rule 
‘‘seems to be one of the primary causes of the explosive growth in the fund.’’ 29 

Further, as the Joint Board has noted: 

Fundamental  differences  exist  between  the  regulatory  treatment  of  competitive 
ETCs  and  incumbent  LECs.  For  example,  competitive  ETCs,  unlike  incumbent 
LECs,  have  no  equal  access  obligations.  Competitive  ETCs  also  are  not  subject 
to rate regulation. In addition, competitive ETCs may not have the same carrier 
of  last  resort  obligations  that  incumbent  LECs  have.  Furthermore,  under  the 
identical  support  rule,  both  incumbent  rural  LECs  and  competitive  ETCs  re-
ceive  support  based  on  the  incumbent  rural  LECs’  costs.  Therefore,  incumbent 
rural LECs’ support is cost-based, while competitive ETCs’ support is not.30 

For  all  of  these  reasons,  limiting  the  cap  to  CETCs  makes  sense  and  is  within 

the Commission’s discretion.31 

The  D.C.  Circuit  has  recently  reaffirmed  that,  with  regard  to  the  Commission’s 
interpretation  of  Section  254,  where  Congress  has  not  spoken  directly  to  an  issue 
(as it has not here), the ultimate test is whether the Commission’s ruling is reason-
able  under  the  circumstances.32 Imposing  a  temporary  cap  on  CETC  funding  is, 
under these circumstances, eminently reasonable. 
V. The Proposed Period for the Cap Is Reasonable 

The  Joint  Board  recommends  that  ‘‘the  cap  expire  1  year  from  the  date  of  any 
Joint  Board  recommended  decision  on  comprehensive  and  fundamental  Universal 
Service reform.’’ 33 To place a definite outer limit on when the cap will end, the Joint 
Board  ‘‘commit[s]  to  adoption  of  a  further  recommended  decision  addressing  funda-
mental  high-cost  reforms  within  6  months  of  today’s  Recommended  Decision.’’ 34 
Taken  together,  this  means  that  the  cap  will  expire  within  18  months  of  May  1,

99 

2007,  the  day  the  Recommended  Decision  was  released,  in  other  words  November 
1, 2008. 

The entire premise behind the cap is that it is to be interim, ‘‘until such measures 
can be adopted that will ensure that the Fund will be sustainable for future years’’ 
and  ‘‘while  the  Joint  Board  and  the  Commission  consider  fundamental  reforms  to 
address  issues  related  to  the  distribution  of  support.’’ 35 It  appears  that  another  18 
months to resolve issues, some of which have been pending since the passage of the 
1996 Act, is sufficient (and probably not more than sufficient).36 Clearly, though, the 
Commission  should  attempt  to  resolve  these  issues  even  more  expeditiously,  after 
giving the stakeholders an adequate opportunity to present their views. 
VI. The Cap Should Apply on a State-by-State Basis 

The  Joint  Board  ‘‘recommend[s]  that  the  Commission  immediately  impose  a  cap 
on  competitive  ETC  support  for  each  state.’’ 37 The  Joint  Board  further  notes  ‘‘that 
a  competitive  ETC  cap  applied  at  a  state  level  effectively  curbs  growth.  . . .’’ 38 
NASUCA  agrees.  A  state-by-state  cap  means  that  no  state  will  receive  less  support 
for CETCs than it currently receives, no matter what happens in other states. 

The  appropriateness  of  a  state-by-state  cap  is  best  seen  by  comparison  to  other 

possibilities. The Joint Board states that it: 

considered,  but  declined  to  recommend,  capping  competitive  ETC  support  na-
tionwide or by study area. A nationwide cap amount would maintain incentives 
for  states  to  designate  additional  competitive  ETCs  to  increase  their  share  of 
competitive  ETC  capped  support  and  would  result  in  competitive  ETC  support 
shifting to those states that aggressively designate competitive ETCs during the 
period  of  the  interim  cap.39 A  cap  by  study  area  would  foreclose  the  possibility 
of support for the duration of the cap for those study areas that currently have 
no competitive ETCs and would be administratively burdensome.40 

NASUCA  agrees  with  the  Joint  Board’s  assessment  of  the  problems  with  using 
a national cap and with using a study area (or smaller) area.41 Placing the cap per 
state  also  keeps  the  responsibility  with  state  commissions,  which  under  the  Act 
have primary responsibility for designation of ETCs.42 
VII. The Cap Should Be at the Level of Support Awarded in 2006 

The  Joint  Board  ‘‘recommend[s]  that  the  Commission  cap  competitive  ETC  sup-
port  for  each  state  at  the  level  of  competitive  ETC  support  actually  distributed  in 
that  state  in  2006.’’ 43 The  Joint  Board  correctly  points  out  that  ‘‘using  2006  data 
allows the Commission to use actual support amounts, rather than relying on USAC 
projections to set the cap amounts.’’ 44 NASUCA agrees with this approach. 

If  the  Commission  orders  a  cap  as  expeditiously  as  appears  may  happen,45 more 
recent  data—for  2007—will  be  limited  to  the  first,  second  and  possibly  (but  hope-
fully  not)  third  quarters  of  the  year.  That  data  will  not  be  representative:  As  the 
Joint Board points out, there are ‘‘seasonal or one-time fluctuations that may be re-
flected  in  any  single  quarter.’’ 46 Using  actual  data  for  the  year  2006  will  ‘‘smooth 
out’’ these fluctuations.47 

Using  the  2006  data  does  not  capture  the  increases  in  CETC  support  that  have 
occurred in the past year. But that increase is part of the problem, of course: Com-
paring USAC’s HC01 appendices for the second quarter of 2007 to the second quar-
ter  of  2006  shows  an  increase  of  24  percent  in  total  CETC  support  just  in  that  1 
year.48 And  comparing  the  first  quarter  of  2007  to  the  first  quarter  of  2006  shows 
an  increase  of  37  percent  in  total  CETC  support.49 The  composite  increase  (com-
paring both quarters in 2006 to both quarters in 2007) is almost 30 percent. If there 
is  a  compulsion  to  ‘‘true  up’’  the  2006  numbers,  an  increase  of  30  percent  could  be 
applied.  Truth  be  told,  any  cap  is  better  than  no  cap;  consumers  will  suffer  if  the 
increases in the high-cost fund are allowed to continue. 
VIII. A Cap on the Entire High-Cost Fund Would Be Feasible 

The  Joint  Board  did  ‘‘not  recommend  additional  caps  on  support  provided  to  in-
cumbent  LECs,  because  the  data  show  less  growth  pressure  from  incumbent 
LECs.’’ 50 This  is  largely  because  ‘‘incumbent  LEC  high-cost  loop  support  is  already 
capped  and  incumbent  interstate  access  support  has  a  targeted  limit’’  while  ‘‘local 
switching support and interstate common line support provided to incumbent LECs 
have been stable in recent years.’’ 51 As stated above, NASUCA agrees with the limi-
tation  of  the  cap  to  only  CETCs;  any  lack  of  competitive  neutrality  is  offset  by  the 
benefits to the public interest. 

If,  however,  the  Commission  insists  on  maintaining  competitive  neutrality,  then 
the  cap  could  be  applied  to  the  entire  high-cost  fund.52 NASUCA  proposed  such  a 
cap in an April 6, 2007 ex parte letter.

The cap would work just like the CETC cap, but would also cover incumbent LEC 

ETCs. To paraphrase the description in the Recommended Decision: 

First,  on  a  quarterly  basis,  the  Universal  Service  Administrative  Company 
(‘‘USAC’’) would calculate the support each ETC would have received under the 
existing  (uncapped)  equal  per-line  support  rule  and  would  sum  these  amounts 
by  state.  Second,  USAC  would  calculate  a  state  reduction  factor  to  reduce  this 
amount to the ETC cap. Specifically, USAC would compare the total amount of 
uncapped  support  to  the  cap  amount  for  each  state.  Where  the  total  state  un-
capped  support  is  greater  than  the  available  state  cap  support  amount,  USAC 
would divide the state cap support amount by the total state uncapped amount 
to yield the state reduction factor. USAC would then apply the state-specific re-
duction  factor  to  the  uncapped  amount  for  each  ETC  within  the  state  to  arrive 
at  the  capped  level  of  high-cost  support.  Where  the  state  uncapped  support  is 
less than the available state capped support amount, no reduction would be re-
quired.53 

The example used by the Joint Board also applies: 

If in State A, the capped amount is $90 million and the total uncapped support 
is  $130  million,  the  reduction  factor  would  be  69.2  percent  ($90/$130).  In  State 
A,  each  ETC’s  support  would  be  multiplied  by  69.2  percent  to  reduce  support 
to  the  capped  amount.  If  in  State  B,  however,  the  base  period  capped  amount 
is  $100  million  and  the  total  uncapped  support  is  $95  million,  there  would  be 
no  reduction  factor  because  the  uncapped  amount  is  less  than  the  capped 
amount. Each quarter, for the duration of the cap, a new reduction factor would 
be calculated for each state.54 

A  state-by-state  cap  on  all  high-cost  payments  should  also  have  a  one-year  dura-

tion and should also use actual 2006 payments as the amount of the cap. 
IX. Conclusion 

The  Commission  cannot  stand  by  as  consumers  continue  to  pay  ever-increasing 
amounts  into  the  USF  while  the  Commission  figures  out  ways  to  constrain  the 
growth in the fund.55 A cap on payments to CETCs will, for the short term, address 
the ‘‘explosive growth’’ in high-cost support disbursements. 

The  proposed  cap  is  reasonable  because  the  known  benefits  of  such  a  cap  far  ex-
ceed the known costs of failing to do so. Under current rules, there is no assurance 
that high-cost support for CETCs results in service deployment that would not have 
been  made  without  such  support.  There  is  also  no  assurance  that  the  current 
amount  of  support  (over  $1  billion  annually  and  rapidly  growing)  is  subsidizing  in-
vestments  that  will  not  generate  substantial  profits  in  future  years.  Moreover, 
under current rules, there is no assurance that the amount of support is reasonable 
given that it is based on the costs of wireline carriers rather than the costs of wire-
less carriers. Therefore, until the Commission has an opportunity to reform the cur-
rent  funding  mechanism,  it  would  be  prudent  to  adopt  the  recommended  cap  as  an 
immediate interim measure, and thereby limit the risk that public support is being 
converted to private profits through the high-cost support mechanism. 

The Commission should expeditiously adopt the proposal of the Joint Board.

some areas; states would not (and should not) have the ability to reallocate support 
among currently authorized ETCs.

sion would be a distraction from the fundamental purpose here, which is to develop 
long-term reforms for the high-cost support mechanism.

52 The  issues  being  dealt  with  here  are  issues  with  the  high-cost  fund.  Thus  the

USF (schools and libraries, low-income and rural telemedicine).

54 See  id.,  ¶ 11.  The  Joint  Board’s  example  includes  the  notation  that  ‘‘if  in  State 
C the base period capped amount is $0 (i.e., there were no competitive ETCs receiv-
ing  support  in  State  C  as  of  when  the  cap  was  established),  then  no  competitive 
ETCs  would  be  eligible  to  receive  support  in  that  state.’’  Id.  The  only  jurisdiction 
that  receives  no  high-cost  support  at  all  is  the  District  of  Columbia;  under  a  total 
cap, no carrier in the District would be able to receive any high-cost support as long 
as the cap lasts.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

HON. DEBORAH TAYLOR TATE 

Question 1. The Joint Board recommendation for a cap on funds available to com-
petitive carriers is designed to be a short-term fix for the growth in Universal Serv-
ice  demand.  In  order  to  ensure  the  long-term  stability  of  Universal  Service,  what 
specific further reforms do you favor? 

Answer.  As  we  look  to  achieve  the  long-term  goals  of  the  Universal  Service  pro-
gram  we  must  recognize  how  technological  changes  are  putting  strains  on  the  me-
chanics  of  both  our  contribution  and  distribution  systems.  With  respect  to  the  con-
tribution mechanism, I believe that a numbers-based contribution mechanism would 
help  maintain  the  stability  of  the  Fund  by  assessing  all  technologies  used  to  make 
a phone call on a similar basis and, unlike the current revenue-based system which 
treats  technologies  differently,  would  be  competitively  and  technologically  neutral. 
With respect to the distribution mechanism, I generally support proposals that allow 
carriers  to  receive  support  based  on  their  own  costs.  In  particular,  along  with  the 
Joint Board, I support the elimination of the identical support rule. I further believe 
we  should  review  whether  the  use  of  reverse  auctions  is  an  effective  and  competi-
tively neutral way to determine high-cost Universal Service funding to Eligible Tele-
communications  Carriers  (ETCs).  Like  you,  I  want  to  help  insure  no  area  or  group 
of our citizens are left behind. 

Question  2.  The  Joint  Board  recommends  that  Universal  Service  funds  for  com-
petitive carriers be capped on a state-by-state basis. But the recommendation omits 
any  mention  of  tribal  lands.  In  light  of  special  jurisdictional  concerns  involving  In-
dian country, how should the FCC apply the cap to tribal lands? 

Answer. Any interim cap order adopted by the Commission will continue the Com-
mission’s  traditional  recognition  that  underserved  tribal  lands  and  Alaska  Native 
Regions are uniquely situated and deserving of individual treatment to ensure that 
they are not left behind urban areas of the country. 

Question  3.  In  order  to  preserve  the  sovereignty  of  the  tribes,  would  it  be  best  to 
address support for competitive carriers serving tribal lands on a case-by-case basis? 
Answer.  Whatever  effective  mechanism  is  adopted,  a  fundamental  reform  plan 
will ensure that the Universal Service Fund promotes the availability of reasonably 
comparable  services  at  reasonably  comparable  rates  throughout  the  country  in  a 
technologically and competitively neutral manner. Comprehensive reform also must 
take into account those areas of our country which are uniquely situated. Any com-
prehensive  reform  plan  will  continue  the  Commission’s  traditional  recognition  that 
underserved  tribal  lands  including  those  in  Hawaii  and  Alaska  Native  Regions  are 
uniquely situated and deserving of individual treatment to ensure that they are not 
left behind urban areas of the country.

103 

Question  4.  The  Joint  Board  characterizes  its  proposal  for  a  cap  on  support  for 
competitive  carriers  as  interim,  while  it  considers  options  for  long-term  reform.  In 
the  long  term,  do  you  believe  the  Universal  Service  Fund  should  support  both 
wireline and wireless technologies? 

Answer.  I  believe  the  Universal  Service  Fund  should  be  administered  in  a  com-
petitively  and  technologically  neutral  manner.  All  carriers,  regardless  of  their  cho-
sen  technology  platform,  should  be  eligible  to  receive  support  based  on  their  own 
costs. 

Question 5. In the long term, do you believe that Universal Service funding should 

be available to more than one carrier in a geographic area? 

Answer.  In  many  areas  defined  as  high  cost  by  the  Commission’s  rules,  multiple 
service  providers  receive  Universal  Service  support.  Indeed,  the  recent  runaway 
growth of the high-cost fund is largely a function of subsidizing multiple competitors 
to  provide  voice  services  in  rural  areas.  I  therefore  question  the  wisdom  of  funding 
multiple carriers in high-cost areas in order to ensure the sustainability of the Fund 
to serve underserved areas. 

Question  6.  In  1997,  the  FCC  decided  to  add  to  the  Universal  Service  principles 
created by Congress a new principle of ‘‘competitive neutrality.’’ Do you believe that 
the Joint Board recommendation is consistent with the principle of competitive neu-
trality? 

Answer.  Yes.  As  discussed  in  the  Recommended  Decision,  the  Joint  Board  found 
that adopting an interim cap on high-cost support only for competitive ETCs would 
not  violate  the  Commission’s  Universal  Service  principle  of  competitive  neutrality 
for several reasons: 

Fundamental  differences  exist  between  the  regulatory  treatment  of  competitive 
ETCs  and  incumbent  LECs.  For  example,  competitive  ETCs,  unlike  incumbent 
LECs,  have  no  equal  access  obligations.  Competitive  ETCs  also  are  not  subject 
to rate regulation. In addition, competitive ETCs may not have the same carrier 
of  last  resort  obligations  that  incumbent  LECs  have.  Furthermore,  under  the 
identical  support  rule,  both  incumbent  rural  LECs  and  competitive  ETCs  re-
ceive  support  based  on  the  incumbent  rural  LECs’  costs.  Therefore,  incumbent 
rural LECs’ support is cost-based, while competitive ETCs’ support is not.1 

The  Joint  Board  further  noted  that  incumbent  LEC  high-cost  loop  support  is  al-

ready capped and incumbent interstate access support has a targeted limit. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

HON. DEBORAH TAYLOR TATE 

Question  1.  The  Communications  Act,  as  amended,  seems  to  indicate  that  dis-
tribution  of  USF  funds  should  be  on  a  competitively  neutral  and  nondiscriminatory 
basis. Do you believe that the proposed interim cap—which only impacts competitive 
carriers—comports with Section 254 and other relevant sections of the Communica-
tions Act? 

Answer.  Yes.  As  discussed  in  the  Recommended  Decision,  the  Joint  Board  found 
that adopting an interim cap on high-cost support only for competitive ETCs would 
not  violate  the  Commission’s  Universal  Service  principle  of  competitive  neutrality 
for several reasons: 

Fundamental  differences  exist  between  the  regulatory  treatment  of  competitive 
ETCs  and  incumbent  LECs.  For  example,  competitive  ETCs,  unlike  incumbent 
LECs,  have  no  equal  access  obligations.  Competitive  ETCs  also  are  not  subject 
to rate regulation. In addition, competitive ETCs may not have the same carrier 
of  last  resort  obligations  that  incumbent  LECs  have.  Furthermore,  under  the 
identical  support  rule,  both  incumbent  rural  LECs  and  competitive  ETCs  re-
ceive  support  based  on  the  incumbent  rural  LECs’  costs.  Therefore,  incumbent 
rural LECs’ support is cost-based, while competitive ETCs’ support is not.2 

The  Joint  Board  further  noted  that  incumbent  LEC  high-cost  loop  support  is  al-

ready capped and incumbent interstate access support has a targeted limit. 

Question  2.  The  Joint  Board  recommendation  indicates  that  the  interim  cap  on 
support  for  competitive  carriers  should  only  last  for  a  maximum  of  18  months  as

the Joint Board and the FCC consider further USF reform efforts. However, the rec-
ommendation  does  not  set  a  firm  date  for  expiration  of  the  cap.  Would  you  favor 
a  firm  expiration  date  as  a  means  of  ensuring  that  the  ‘‘interim  cap’’  does  not  be-
come  a  permanent  solution—and  that  further  reform  efforts  are  kept  on  an  expe-
dited schedule? 

Answer.  I  do  not  believe  that  a  firm  expiration  date  is  necessary.  As  the  Rec-
ommended  Decision  and  its  companion  Public  Notice  make  clear,  the  Joint  Board 
is  committed  to  making  further  recommendations  regarding  comprehensive  high- 
cost Universal Service reform within 6 months of this Recommended Decision. I am 
committed,  as  the  Federal  Chair,  to  putting  the  Joint  Board  in  a  position  to  make 
those  recommendations.  Once  the  Joint  Board  issues  a  Recommended  Decision  to 
the  FCC,  the  Commission  is  statutorily  required  to  complete  its  proceedings  re-
sponding to the Recommended Decision within 1 year.3 

Question  3.  If  an  interim  cap  is  not  adopted,  would  the  USF  contribution  factor 
increase past its current rate of 11.7 percent? If so, how high do you think it would 
go by the second quarter of 2008? 

Answer. High-cost Universal Service support has been rapidly increasing over the 
past  several  years,  caused  primarily  by  growth  in  support  for  competitive  ETCs. 
Competitive  ETC  high-cost  distributions  have  been  growing  at  a  trend  rate  of  101 
percent-per-year since 2002. Specifically, in 2000, competitive ETCs received $1 mil-
lion  in  support.  According  to  USAC,  competitive  ETCs  received  almost  $1  billion  in 
2006.  However,  we  do  know,  in  absence  of  a  cap,  that  high-cost  distributions  will 
continue  to  grow  with  the  designation  of  additional  competitive  ETCs  and  line 
growth among existing competitive ETCs. Absent the imposition of a cap, it is very 
likely  that  high-cost  support  to  competitive  ETCs  will  continue  to  grow.  It  is  dif-
ficult, however, to predict the effect this continued growth in competitive ETC high- 
cost support would have on the contribution factor. The contribution factor is based 
on expected interstate telecommunications revenues and so the amount of revenues 
generated  can  affect  the  contribution  factor.  Additionally,  the  contribution  factor  is 
based  not  only  on  the  support  required  for  the  high-cost  fund,  but  support  for  the 
other  Universal  Service  support  mechanisms  as  well.  These  mechanisms  are  the 
schools  and  libraries,  rural  healthcare,  and  low-income  programs.  Additionally, 
other  factors,  such  as  prior  period  adjustments  and  changes  in  interest  income  due 
to interest rate changes, will affect the contribution factor in a given quarter. Given 
these  other  variables,  we  cannot  make  an  accurate  prediction  of  the  contribution 
factor based on whether or not an interim cap on competitive ETC high-cost support 
is adopted. 

Question  4.  In  your  testimony,  you  note  that  the  Joint  Board  is  committed  to  re-
leasing  a  list  of  comprehensive  reform  recommendations  by  November  1.  Can  you 
give us an update on the specific measures you are pursuing? What sort of cost sav-
ings can we expect from these recommendations, if implemented? 

Answer.  The  Joint  Board  held  a  meeting  on  July  18,  2007  in  New  York  City  to 
discuss the comments and reply comments filed in response to the Joint Board Com-
prehensive Reform Public Notice. The discussion was spirited and wide-ranging, and 
addressed  a  variety  of  recommendations  that  have  been  placed  before  the  Joint 
Board for our consideration. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues 
on  the  Joint  Board  to  narrow  the  scope  of  our  discussions  and  focus  on  specific 
measures toward the goal of Fund reform. 

I can not at this time estimate the cost savings that would result from the imple-
mentation  of  some  or  all  of  the  recommendations  currently  under  discussion.  As 
stewards of public funds, however, our obligation to preserve and advance Universal 
Service  mandates  that  we  do  all  we  can  to  achieve  fundamental  reform  to  ensure 
that  affordable,  quality  services  are  available  to  consumers  all  across  the  country 
while ensuring the stability of the Fund itself.

Question  1.  New  Jersey  is  the  second-largest  net  donor  to  the  Universal  Service 
Fund  in  the  country,  contributing  almost  $200  million.  Will  the  Joint  Board’s  pro-
posed interim cap help to reduce this burden on New Jersey? 

Answer.  I  appreciate  your  comments  regarding  New  Jersey.  My  home  State  of 
Tennessee  is  also  a  net  donor  state.  High  cost  Universal  Service  support  has  been 
rapidly  increasing  over  the  past  several  years,  caused  primarily  by  growth  in  sup-

port  for  competitive  ETCs.  Imposition  of  an  interim  cap  on  high-cost  support  pro-
vided  to  competitive  ETCs  pending  fundamental  reform  will  ensure  that  the  Fund 
will  be  sustainable  for  future  years.  This  action  will  prevent  increases  in  high-cost 
support due to the designation of additional competitive ETCs or line growth among 
existing  competitive  ETCs.  Although  I  would  have  preferred  that  the  Joint  Board 
make  a  recommendation  with  respect  to  fundamental  reform,  the  cap  will  stop 
growth in competitive ETC support while the Joint Board and the Commission con-
sider  fundamental  reforms  to  address  issues  related  to  the  distribution  of  support. 
Question 2. What can be done to reduce the growth in the Universal Service Fund 

and lessen the burden on consumers in donor states? 

Answer.  As  we  look  to  achieve  the  long-term  goals  of  the  Universal  Service  pro-
gram,  we  must  recognize  how  technological  changes  are  putting  strains  on  the  me-
chanics  of  both  our  contribution  and  distribution  systems.  With  respect  to  the  con-
tribution mechanism, I believe that a numbers-based contribution mechanism would 
help  maintain  the  stability  of  the  Fund  by  assessing  all  technologies  used  to  make 
a phone call on a similar basis and would be competitively and technologically neu-
tral. With respect to the distribution mechanism, I generally support proposals that 
allow  carriers  to  receive  support  based  on  their  own  costs.  In  particular,  I  support 
the  elimination  of  the  identical  support  rule  by  which  competitive  Eligible  Tele-
communications  Carriers  (ETCs)  receive  support  based  on  the  incumbent’s  costs, 
even  if  its  costs  are  significantly  lower.  I  further  believe  we  should  review  whether 
the  use  of  reverse  auctions  is  an  effective  and  competitively  neutral  way  to  deter-
mine  high-cost  Universal  Service  funding  to  ETCs.  Implementation  of  such  pro-
posals would benefit consumers in both net donor and net recipient states. 

Question 3. Is the Joint Board considering the use of reverse auctions to distribute 
Universal  Service  funds?  Would  reverse  auctions  reduce  the  size  of  the  Fund  and 
help donor states like New Jersey? 

Answer. On August 11, 2006, the Joint Board issued a Public Notice seeking com-
ment  from  interested  parties  on  the  use  of  auctions  to  determine  Universal  Service 
support.4 More than 50 parties filed comments and reply comments in fall 2006, re-
sponding to the Joint Board’s request for comment. On February 20, 2007, the Joint 
Board  held  an  en  banc  hearing  in  Washington,  D.C.,  where  it  heard,  among  other 
issues, from experts in support of, and in opposition to, the use of auctions to deter-
mine  Universal  Service  support.  5 The  Joint  Board  also  issued  a  Public  Notice  on 
May  1,  2007  seeking  comment  on  proposals  for  long-term,  comprehensive  reform  of 
high-cost Universal Service support.6 Among the proposals on which the Joint Board 
sought  comment  is  a  proposal  to  use  reverse  auctions  to  distribute  high-cost  sup-
port.  I  further  believe  we  should  review  whether  the  use  of  reverse  auctions  could 
provide  a  technologically  and  competitively  neutral  means  of  controlling  Fund 
growth  and  ensuring  that  supported  carriers  utilize  the  most  efficient  technologies 
over  time,  which  would  benefit  consumers  in  both  net  donor  and  net  recipient 
states.

Question  1.  The  Joint  Board  characterizes  its  proposal  for  a  cap  on  support  for 
competitive  carriers  as  interim,  while  it  considers  options  for  long-term  reform.  In 
the  long  term,  do  you  believe  the  Universal  Service  Fund  should  support  both 
wireline and wireless technologies? 

Answer. Yes. Both services are complimentary to each other and, in the long term, 
the Fund should support both wireline and wireless technologies. However, the sup-
port should be based on the carriers own costs and, therefore, the identical support 
rule  should  be  eliminated.  As  Chairman  of  OPASTCO,  I  am  on  record  in  support 
of  the  Joint  Board’s  recommended  interim  cap  on  the  competitive  eligible  tele-
communications carrier (CETC) portion of the Fund. 

Question 2. In the long term, do you believe that Universal Service funding should 

be available to more than one carrier in a geographic area?

Answer.  Yes.  As  stated  above,  both  wireline  and  wireless  technologies  should  be 
supported.  Carriers  receiving  Universal  Service  Fund  (USF)  support  should  fulfill 
the  goals  of  the  1996  Telecommunications  Act  by  being  accountable,  efficient  and 
by properly using the funds. 

Question  3.  In  1997,  the  FCC  decided  to  add  to  the  Universal  Service  principles 
created by Congress a new principle of ‘‘competitive neutrality.’’ Do you believe that 
the Joint Board recommendation is consistent with the principle of competitive neu-
trality? 

Answer.  Yes.  The  USF’s  high-cost  loop  fund  for  wireline  service  has  been  capped 
for  a  number  of  years.  As  FCC  Chairman  Kevin  Martin  has  illustrated,  all  of  the 
current growth in the high-cost program has been in the CETC portion of the Fund 
while there has been no growth in the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) por-
tion  of  the  Fund.  The  Joint  Board’s  current  recommendation  is  to  temporarily  cap 
CETCs. The proposed interim cap is to slow the growth of the Fund while both Con-
gress and the FCC enact comprehensive USF reforms. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

ROGER NISHI 

Question 1. For those of you who do not support the interim cap, what other steps 

can we take to immediately control growth of the USF? 

Answer. As Chairman of OPASTCO, I am on record in support of the interim cap 
on CETCs. In addition, elimination of the identical support rule would substantially 
control the growth of the Fund. 

Question 2. The rapid recent growth in the Fund seems to indicate that we must 

do something—I’d like to hear your solutions. 

Answer. First, the FCC needs to quickly adopt the Joint Board’s recommendation 
to temporarily cap the CETC fund. Next, both Congress and the FCC need to move 
forward  with  long-term  reforms  such  as  eliminating  the  identical  support  rule, 
broadening the base of contributors to the Fund and strengthening the requirements 
for CETC designation. 

Question  3.  Getting  beyond  the  issue  of  an  interim  cap,  what  recommendations 

do you have for comprehensive Universal Service reform? 

Answer.  Eliminate  the  identical  support  rule,  broaden  the  base  of  contributors  to 

the Fund and strengthen the requirements for CETC designation. 

Question 4. What savings do you think these suggestions would generate? 
Answer.  The  suggested  reforms  in  the  above  answer  would  make  the  Fund  more 
efficient,  require  greater  accountability  and  provide  for  the  proper  use  of  the  Fund 
as  envisioned  by  the  1996  Telecommunications  Act.  However,  if  policymakers  want 
to  achieve  ubiquitous  broadband  and  mobility  services,  it  is  unreasonable  to  expect 
the size of the Fund to shrink. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

JONATHAN D. FOXMAN 

Question  1.  The  Joint  Board  characterizes  its  proposal  for  a  cap  on  support  for 
competitive  carriers  as  interim,  while  it  considers  options  for  long-term  reform.  In 
the  long  term,  do  you  believe  the  Universal  Service  Fund  should  support  both 
wireline and wireless technologies? 

Answer.  I  believe  Universal  Service  Fund  support  should  not  distinguish  among 
technologies. The fund should support the designated services regardless of the tech-
nology (wireless vs. wireline), and regardless of category of service provider—wheth-
er the provider satisfying the ETC criteria is an incumbent or a competitive entrant. 
The  purpose  of  the  Fund  is  to  provide  rural  communities  with  services  and  choices 
that  are  comparable  to  those  available  in  urban  communities.  I  believe  what  tech-
nology  is  utilized  to  deliver  those  services  is  incidental.  In  fact,  it  serves  the  public 
interest for government to be ‘‘color blind’’ with respect to technology. If a new tech-
nology can provide the same or better service or more services at a lower cost, then 
allowing  it  to  be  utilized,  i.e.,  without  the  discrimination  that  would  be  implicit  in 
unequally  subsidizing  a  less  efficient  technology,  will  force  one  or  both  of  the  fol-
lowing  beneficial  outcomes  of  competition.  Either  the  company  that  provides  the 
more  efficient  technology  will  win  customers  and  deliver  to  them  a  better  service 
at  a  lower  cost  or  incumbents  will  be  forced  to  (a)  improve  the  efficiency  and  capa-
bilities of their businesses or (b) adopt the new technology and bring the same bene-
fits  to  consumers.  In  either  case,  the  consumer  will  benefit.  For  this  reason,  I  be-

lieve the Universal Service Fund should support any technology—wireless, wireline, 
or whatever may develop in the future. 

107 

Question 2. In the long term, do you believe that Universal Service funding should 

be available to more than one carrier in a geographic area? 

Answer.  Yes.  Competition  is  essential  to  delivery  of  high  quality,  affordable  ad-
vanced communications services. The evidence is overwhelming. So much of our Na-
tion’s  economic  system,  regulations,  and  laws  are  based  upon  this  principle  of  the 
benefits of competition. 

I  feel  very  strongly  that  the  public  interest  is  served  best  when  companies  can 
compete  freely  to  earn  consumers’  business.  The  human  mind  and,  therefore,  all 
that  it  creates  (including  businesses)  is  driven  by  a  complex  system  of  responses  to 
incentives and disincentives. There must be an incentive to providing the best serv-
ice at the lowest cost and a disincentive to not doing so. Anything less cannot maxi-
mize  the  benefit  to  consumers  and,  therefore,  does  not  serve  the  public  interest.  If 
only one carrier can access Universal Service funding support in a geographic area, 
then it will have little incentive to serve consumers’ needs adequately; and competi-
tive  entrants  would  be  denied  the  ability  or  incentive  to  enter  the  market.  There 
are  no  examples  in  our  economic  history  when  this  has  been  a  good  thing.  There-
fore, I believe it is critical that Universal Service funding be available to more than 
one carrier in a geographic area. 

Question  3.  In  1997,  the  FCC  decided  to  add  to  the  Universal  Service  principles 
created by Congress a new principle of ‘‘competitive neutrality.’’ Do you believe that 
the Joint Board recommendation is consistent with the principle of competitive neu-
trality? 

Answer.  I  do  not  believe  that  the  Joint  Board’s  recommendation  is  at  all  con-
sistent  with  the  principle  of  competitive  neutrality.  It  is  inappropriate  for  regu-
lators, rather than consumers, to distinguish among types of companies and, there-
by, pick winners and losers in what is supposed to be a free market. 

Similarly,  I  do  not  believe  that  eliminating  the  so-called  ‘‘identical  support’’  rule 
would  be  consistent  with  the  principle  of  competitive  neutrality.  If  the  government 
gives  the  incumbent  ILEC  $1  per  line,  then  it  should  give  the  CETC  $1  per  line; 
that is competitive neutrality. If a cap were imposed and the ILEC received, for ex-
ample,  $1  per  line  while  the  CETC  only  received  75  cents  for  providing  the  same 
supported  service  to  the  same  customers,  that  would  blatantly  violate  competitive 
neutrality and would amount to improperly favoring one technology or type of com-
petitor  over  another.  Specifically,  if  you  support  the  highest  cost  competitor  in  a 
marketplace with greater subsidization, are you not favoring them? Are you not ac-
commodating  their  inefficiency  and  interfering  with  the  workings  of  the  free  mar-
ket? 

Furthermore, wireless is required and accountable to use the $1 to expand its net-
work.  If  it  happens  that  the  wireless  company  can  do  more  with  that  $1  per  line, 
for example build two cell sites instead of one, then that is a good thing; it benefits 
consumers and avoids waste of public funds. Every penny of the dollar will be spent 
to  further  the  public  interest,  as  intended  by  Congress  in  the  Telecommunications 
Act of 1996 and as mandated of the FCC in its formative statute. In fact, when the 
dollar goes to rural construction investment by the low-cost competitor, more of the 
dollar goes to serving the public interest than if the dollar were given to an incum-
bent  ILEC,  many  of  whom  are  guaranteed  a  very  comfortable  rate  of  return  which 
they  can  send  to  their  investors.  If  identical  support  results  in  pressure  on  the  in-
cumbent ILECs to maximize their efficiency or even to improve or change their tech-
nology, those improvements will benefit consumers. 

The  benefits  of  identical  support  per  line,  regardless  of  how  the  level  of  support 
is  determined,  include  resulting  fairness,  public  service,  and  efficiency:  (a)  the  gov-
ernment  will  have  done  its  job  of  ensuring  competitive  neutrality,  i.e.,  ‘‘I  gave  you 
each $1; I did not arbitrarily decide that one of you would receive that funding but 
not  the  other,’’  (b)  the  CETC  will  have  done  its  job  by  investing  that  $1  in  its  net-
work  as  required  by  law,  benefiting  the  customer  and  again  with  clear  account-
ability because of the detailed accountings required by state government, and (c) the 
marketplace  will  have  done  its  job  by  then  pressuring  all  competitors  to  be  as  effi-
cient  as  possible,  even  to  the  point  of  evolving  their  businesses  and  technologies  if 
necessary, to meet the needs of rural consumers. Perfect!

108 

Answer. As an important preface to my response, I urge you to reconsider wheth-
er there is truly a need to ‘‘immediately control growth of the USF.’’ Growth in the 
Fund  is  in  fact  not  an  imminent  threat,  and  therefore  does  not  need  to  be  imme-
diately  controlled.  In  fact,  while  the  Joint  Board  claims  an  ‘‘emergency’’  has  arisen 
from recent growth, the Fund over the years has weathered significant growth rates 
without  becoming  ‘‘unsustainable.’’  Support  to  ILECs  jumped  from  $1.7  billion  in 
1999 to $3.1 billion in 2003, and continued to increase from 2003 to 2005. (Support 
to ILECs was growing during these periods even though ILEC line counts were de-
creasing.)  Moreover,  three-quarters  of  the  2.0  percent  increase  in  the  contribution 
factor  from  9.7  percent  to  11.7  percent  from  the  first  quarter  to  the  second  quarter 
of  2007  was  as  a  result  of  true-up  mechanisms  within  the  program  (1.5  percent  of 
2.0  percent).  Only  one-tenth  of  the  2.0  percent  increase  resulted  from  increases  in 
high-cost  support.  This  calculation  corresponds  with  FCC  Chairman  Martin’s  letter 
responding  to  an  inquiry  from  Representative  Edward  Markey.1 Moreover,  the  con-
tribution factor decreased significantly (to 11.3 percent) in the third quarter of 2007. 
Even accepting, for the sake of argument, the Board’s unsupported projection that 
the Fund could increase by another $1 billion in the next year, that increase would 
add  only  31  cents  to  the  Federal  Universal  Service  charge.  As  the  Montana  Public 
Service  Commission  recently  stated,  the  annual  percentage  rate  of  growth  in  the 
Fund is trending toward decreasing, and ‘‘[t]he growth in the size of the FUSF that 
CETCs receive appears to behave like an ‘‘S-curve’’ (logistic).’’ 2 

Furthermore, Universal Service Administrative Company (‘‘USAC’’) projections be-
tween  the  fourth  quarter  of  2006  and  the  second  quarter  of  2007  show  high-cost 
support rising 3.9 percent.3 This is a much lower rate of growth than prior periods, 
suggesting  that  the  growth  rate  is  slowing.  Moreover,  these  increases  are  largely  a 
product of the fact that CETCs are new entrants who started with a baseline of zero 
support  from  the  fund.  As  competitive  entry  has  advanced,  CETCs’  share  of  the 
Fund has increased correspondingly. 

However,  increased  payments  to  competitors  were  foreseen  by  the  drafters  of  the 
1996 legislation.4 What legislators did not anticipate 5 was that after competitors en-

committee on Telecommunications and the Internet, Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. 
House of Representatives (rel. May 14, 2007), at 1 (‘‘Martin Letter’’): 

Several  factors  contributed  to  the  2  percent  increase  of  the  contribution  factor  for  the  second 
quarter of 2007. The largest single factor was prior period adjustments that acted to reduce the 
Universal Service Fund’s revenue requirements in previous quarters. Specifically, these prior pe-
riod adjustments arose from additional contributions made by AT&T and Verizon on past under- 
reported revenue, and from a change in the amount of funds that the Universal Service Admin-
istrative Company held in reserve for bad debts. The absence of these prior period adjustments 
caused  a  1.5  percent  increase  in  the  contributions  factor.  The  remaining  0.5  percent  of  the  in-
crease  was  due  to  reductions  in  the  funding  base,  increases  in  program  demand,  including  for

While  the  FUSF  growth  due  to  CETC  designations  has  increased  monotonically  since  year 
2000,  the  annual  percentage  rate  of  growth  has  at  the  same  time  nearly  decreased 
monotonically.  . . .  [F]or  the  Joint  Board  to  now  predict  a  90  percent  plus  annual  percent 
growth rate for 2006 to 2007 is suspect.

4 If  concern  over  Fund  size  relates  to  carrier  receipts,  consider  the  fact  that  wireline  carriers 
still receive an enormous share of Universal Service funding. In the State of Montana, in 2006, 
according to the Joint Board, incumbent wireline carriers received $69.7 million in funding, and 
competitive  carriers  such  as  wireless  received  $7.2  million  in  funding.  See  Federal-State  Joint 
Board  on  Universal  Service,  Universal  Service  Monitoring  Report,  Table  7.2  (2006),  attached 
hereto  (‘‘Monitoring  Report  Attachment’’).  Incumbent  wireline  carriers  still  receive  more  than 
three times as much funding as their wireless and wireline competitors, and in some states, they 
receive 100 percent of Universal Service funding. The FCC adopted a five-year transition period, 
which  it  has  extended  indefinitely,  during  which  rural  ILECs  would  not  lose  support  when 
CETCs  entered.  See  Federal-State  Joint  Board  on  Universal  Service,  Fourteenth  Report  and 
Order, Twenty-second Order on Reconsideration, and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 16

tered rural markets, there would be a failure of regulatory will to concomitantly re-
duce  funding  to  carriers  who  lost  customers  or  used  funds  inefficiently.6 Certainly, 
Federal  decisions  in  these  matters  cannot  be  universally  popular  with  all  industry 
participants—but  consumers,  not  carriers,  are  the  intended  beneficiaries  of  Uni-
versal Service. As the Montana Public Service Commission noted recently,7 

There  is,  however,  need  to  consider  the  benefits  of  CETC  designation,  benefits 
that play out in terms of economic development, public interest benefits to con-
sumers, and ultimately Universal Service. If the FCC is to have a balanced deci-
sion,  it  must  not  ignore  Universal  Service  benefits  to  the  exclusive  focus  on 
Fund size. 

Congress,  enacting  the  1996  Telecom  Act,  decided  that  rural  consumers  should 
have  the  access  to  advanced  services  such  as  wireless  that  are  reasonably  com-
parable  in  quality  and  price  as  their  urban  counterparts,  from  providers  operating 
in  competitive  markets,  governed  by  technology-neutral  rules.  In  short,  the  growth 
of the Fund is not some unintended aberration; it is the direct result of a conscious 
and enlightened public policy. 

If some perceive that the Universal Service Fund is attracting too much demand, 
then  we  need  to  consider  whether  Universal  Service  funding  should  be  equitably 
distributed  to  the  carriers  who  can  use  it  most  efficiently,  and  whose  services  are 
most  in  demand.  Any  other  result  would  injure  citizens,  who  increasingly  desire 
wireless  service—particularly  in  rural  areas,  where  wireless  service  is  very  useful 
for  stranded  people  roadside,  and  where  wireless  carriers  need  Universal  Service 
funding  in  order  to  fiscally  justify  extending  their  networks  to  serve  additional 
areas.  Unlike  incumbent  local  exchange  carriers,  wireless  carriers  do  not  have  a 
built-in,  regulator-guaranteed  rate  of  return.  Moreover,  we  do  not  collect  access 
charges,  a  solid  revenue  stream  for  wireline  carriers.  Accordingly,  our  business 
model  depends  upon  making  a  solid  business  case,  in  terms  of  customer  revenues, 
for  every  tower  we  must  fund.  If  the  customer  revenues  cannot  justify  the  tower, 
then  it  cannot  be  built,  pursuant  to  lenders’  and  investors’  fiscally  responsible  re-
quirements—unless  another  source  of  funding  for  that  tower  is  available,  such  as 
Universal  Service.  If  Universal  Service  funds  are  denied  to  wireless  carriers,  or  di-
minished, many towers in rural areas, therefore, will not be built. 

Meaningful competition does not exist in rural areas where wireless carriers can-
not,  without  support,  provide  consumers  with  a  viable  substitute  for  wireline  serv-
ice.  This  is  supported  by  FCC  data.  Between  1995  and  2005,  the  average  cost  per 
minute  for  wireless  service  has  dropped  from  43  cents  per  minute  to  7  cents  per 
minute.8 Competitive forces have not only driven down prices, they have driven the 
average  number  of  wireless  minutes  per  month  upward  from  119  minutes  to  740 
minutes over the same period.9 Accordingly, the price of telephone service for wire-
less consumers, who contribute more to the USF than any other class of consumers, 
has  decreased  dramatically  thanks  to  competition,  even  including  the  increase  in 
the  contribution  factor.  The  drafters  of  the  1996  Act  were  correct  in  believing  in, 
and desiring to permit, the benefits of competition. 

Without  receiving  Universal  Service  funds  comparable  to  those  received  by 
wireline carriers, wireless carriers cannot compete on an even footing with the USF- 
receiving LECs, and the benefits of true competition cannot reach rural areas. 

It should not be surprising that funding for competitive ETCs has increased. After all, before 
the advent of competition incumbents received 100 percent of high-cost funding. It was expected 
that  as  competitors  gained  ETC  status  and  won  customers  in  high-cost  areas,  their  high-cost 
funding would rise. What is surprising is that incumbent support has not dropped by an amount 
proportionate to the increase in competitive ETC funding. . . . 

Not  only  was  the  introduction  of  competition  expected  to  lower  prices  of  telecommunications 
services,  it  was  supposed  to  lower  the  cost  of  Universal  Service  as  providers  competed  for  the 
Universal Service subsidy.

Nevertheless,  if  steps  are  to  be  taken  in  order  to  immediately  control  growth  in 

the Fund, please see the response to the next question, below. 

110 

Question 2. The rapid recent growth in the Fund seems to indicate that we must 

do something—I’d like to hear your solutions. 

Answer. First, as noted in the preceding response, growth in the Fund is nothing 
new  or  extraordinary,  and  most  of  the  recent  growth  was  not  even  caused  by  in-
creases  in  the  high-cost  fund  (relating  to  wireless  carriers).10 In  addition,  on  June 
11,  2007,  the  FCC’s  Wireline  Competition  Bureau  announced  that  it  would  release 
an additional $650 million in unused E-Rate funds from funding years 2001–2004.11 
We  support  appropriate  use  of  funds  for  schools  and  libraries.  But  this  unexpected 
disbursement  of  $650  million  in  previously  withheld  funding—equivalent  to  nearly 
two-thirds  of  the  total  support  granted  to  CETC  carriers  for  the  entire  year  of 
2006—raises  questions  about  the  basis  for  the  contribution  factor  and  the  reasons 
for  the  wild  fluctuations  in  the  rate  (from  9.7  percent  in  the  first  quarter,  to  11.7 
percent during the second quarter, to 11.3 percent during the third quarter of 2007). 
Why was this enormous disbursement made if the Fund is in jeopardy? 

Moreover,  the  effect  of  Fund  growth  on  consumer  rates  is,  at  least  currently,  we 
believe, offset by the fall in prices for wireless services, as discussed in detail in my 
written  testimony  submitted  with  this  Committee.  Accordingly,  for  all  of  the  fore-
going  reasons,  Joint  Board  and  FCC  concern  over  this  growth  is  vastly  overstated. 
Nevertheless,  I  offer  here  suggestions  for  legislative  action.  In  summary,  a  long 
term  plan  should  be  developed  and  implemented,  including  portability  of  support 
and  broad  based  contributions  to  the  Fund,  and  recognizing  the  increasing  impor-
tance of the broadband and mobility aspects of telecommunications services. The de-
tails are as follows. 
A.  Make  Support  ‘‘Portable’’:  If  a  Carrier  Loses  a  Line,  It  Should  Lose  Support/ 

Funding for That Line 

We  favor  making  support  fully  portable,  in  order  that  a  carrier  that  wins  a  line 
wins  the  accompanying  USF  support.  Many  of  the  lines‘  for  which  local  exchange 
carriers  receive  support  were  dug  in  and  paid  off  many  years  ago;  some  are  no 
longer even used to provide service. CETCs’ customers are increasingly shouldering 
the burden of funding the USF, and indeed will eventually be the primary contribu-
tors  in  some  areas.  Accordingly,  it  would  be  illogical  to  take  from  the  customers  of 
new  entrants  still  paying  for  their  initial  infrastructure  in  order  to  give  to  the  cus-
tomers of the existing carriers with entrenched customer bases, USF incomes, access 
line incomes, and little if any new construction expenses. 

We believe the carrier that has the customer should receive the support for serv-
ing  that  customer.  And  logically,  when  a  carrier  loses  a  customer,  the  support 
should  stop  arriving.  This  approach  was  initially  upheld  by  the  Fifth  Circuit  Court 
of Appeals in the case of Alenco Communications, Inc. v. FCC: 

. . .  [T]he  [FCC’s  Universal  Service]  order  provides  that  the  Universal  Service 
subsidy  be  portable  so  that  it  moves  with  the  customer,  rather  than  stay  with 
the incumbent LEC . . . The purpose of Universal Service is to benefit the cus-
tomer,  not  the  carrier.  ‘‘Sufficient’’  funding  of  the  customer’s  right  to  adequate 
telephone service can be achieved regardless of which carrier ultimately receives 
the subsidy.12 

Yet, inexplicably, this course was reversed by the FCC, and now, the cost of USF 
subsidies  that  are  still  being  paid  to  wireline  carriers  for  customers  those  carriers 
have lost (lines that were built long ago and paid for many times over) is over $300 
million  per  year.  Wireless  carriers,  in  contrast,  lose  support  when  we  lose  cus-
tomers.  The  Senate  can  direct  the  FCC  to  reduce  waste  in  the  system  by  requiring 
that a carrier no longer serving a customer give up its claim to funds initially relat-
ing  to  that  connection.  We  believe  that  a  carrier  that  loses  a  customer  should  stop 
receiving support for that customer’s lines. 

10 See  note  1,  supra,  citing  the  letter  wherein  FCC  Chairman  Martin  noted  that  most  of  the 
recent  Fund  growth  stems  from  ‘‘prior  period  adjustments  arose  from  additional  contributions 
made  by  AT&T  and  Verizon  on  past  under-reported  revenue,  and  from  a  change  in  the  amount 
of funds that the Universal Service Administrative Company held in reserve for bad debts.’’ Mar-
tin Letter (emphasis supplied).

B. Broaden Base of Support 

In addition, we suggest broadening the basis of support in order that all providers 
of  communications-based  services,  including  broadband  voice  and  information  serv-
ices, will be required to contribute to Universal Service. Specifically, we believe con-
tributions  should  be  supported  by  VoIP,  broadband  (wireline,  cable,  and  wireless), 
and voice-grade mobile, ILECs, and CLECs. 
C. Recognize Increasing Importance of Broadband and Mobility 

Please see the response to the question below. 
Question  3.  Getting  beyond  the  issue  of  an  interim  cap,  what  recommendations 

do you have for comprehensive Universal Service reform? 

Answer.  We  suggest  shifting  away  from  the  current  funding  structure,  which  is 
oriented to support legacy voice services, and instead focusing on support for the de-
ployment and operation of broadband services and mobile wireless services, in high- 
cost rural areas. This would recognize citizens’ increasing desires in rural areas for 
advanced  broadband  and  mobile  services  similar  to  those  available  in  urban  areas, 
but that have not yet been fully deployed in many rural, high-cost areas. Broadband 
and  mobility  are  the  21st  century  functionalities  that  consumers  most  intensely 
want and need. 

Accordingly,  we  believe  it  is  logical  to  replace  the  existing  system  with  one  that 
targets funds, on a competitively and technologically neutral basis, to the broadband 
and mobile networks that should be built to satisfy consumers today—and that con-
comitantly  draws  equitable  contributions  from  all  telecommunications-based  serv-
ices, including all IP services. At the same time, the existing ‘‘legacy’’ funding mech-
anisms  should  be  reformed  and  phased  down,  because  the  traditional  20th  century 
voice  services  to  which  they  are  targeted  are  already  fully  deployed  in  most  rural 
areas,  and  demand  for  those  services  is  declining.  Many  of  the  carriers  that  de-
ployed legacy voice systems would now like to deploy advanced broadband or mobile 
technologies,  so  this  system  should  transition  their  fund  receipts  from  legacy  voice 
system funding to funding for the new, advanced technologies. 

Question 4. What savings do you think these suggestions would generate? 
Answer.  We  believe  these  suggestions  will  save  sufficient  funds  to  stabilize  the 
Fund,  and  will  generate  benefits  that  far  outweigh  any  costs.  They  will  target  the 
disbursed  funds  more  efficiently,  by  creating  incentives  for  all  carriers  to  provide 
improved services, with funding based on a model of forward-looking costs of an effi-
cient provider of services. These suggestions would focus disbursements so as to mo-
tivate  efficient  provision  of  the  broadband  and  mobility  services  that  modern  citi-
zens  increasingly  want,  for  critical  public  safety  as  well  as  business  and  personal 
communications, including in the rural areas this Fund was designed to serve.
