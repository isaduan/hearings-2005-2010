the  gaps  in  our  understanding  of  ocean  acidification  and  the  implications  of  ocean
acidification  for  marine  resource  management.  Dr.  Doney  will  also  discuss  current
interagency efforts and federal programs addressing ocean acidification.
Dr.  Ken  Caldeira,  Scientist,  Department  of  Global  Ecology,  Carnegie  Insti-
tution for Science of Washington. Dr. Caldeira will discuss the ongoing changes
in  the  global  carbon  cycle  and  its  relationship  to  ocean  acidification  including  the
research  and  modeling  efforts  needed  to  better  understand  ocean  acidification  and
to project its impacts and develop strategies for adaptation and mitigation.
Mr.  Brad  Warren,  Director,  Productive  Oceans  Partnership  Program,  Sus-
tainable  Fisheries  Partnership.  The  Sustainable  Fisheries  Partnership  provides
policy  and  technical  guidance  to  seafood  suppliers  and  producers.  The  Productive
Oceans Partnership Program was formed to address the issue of ocean acidification.
Mr.  Warren  will  discuss  the  potential  impacts  of  ocean  acidification  on  the  world
seafood  industry  and  the  steps  the  Partnership  is  recommending  to  deal  with  the
problem of ocean acidification.

Background
What is Ocean Acidification?

Ocean  acidification  is  the  process  by  which  the  pH  of  seawater  is  being  lowered
through  the  absorption  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  from  the  atmosphere.  Atmospheric
concentrations  of  CO2 have  increased  over  the  past  200  years  from  a  pre-industrial

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:41 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042610 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E08\060508\42610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

level of about 280 parts per million to 379 parts per million in 2005.1 The concentra-
tion  of  CO2 in  the  atmosphere  would  be  much  higher  if  not  for  the  absorption  of
CO2 by the oceans. The oceans have absorbed about 50 percent of the carbon dioxide
(CO2) released over the past 200 years due to human activities resulting in chemical
reactions  that  release  carbonic  acid  and  lower  ocean  pH.  The  Royal  Society  of  Lon-
don  released  a  report  in  2005  of  the  consequences  of  ocean  acidification  and  indi-
cated  that  the  increase  in  acidity  could  be  as  high  as  30  percent  over  the  last  200
years.2

Impacts of Ocean Acidification

While  oceanic  absorption  of  CO2 has  reduced  the  atmospheric  concentration  of
CO2 and  therefore  limited  the  greenhouse  effect,  acidification  of  the  oceans  may
have  negative  consequences  for  sea-life  that  uses  calcium  carbonate  to  grow  shells
and  other  physical  structures.  A  growing  number  of  studies  have  demonstrated  ad-
verse impacts on marine organisms, including a decreased rate at which reef-build-
ing corals produce their skeletons; reduction in the ability of marine algae and free-
swimming  zooplankton  to  maintain  protective  shells  and  exoskeletons;  and  reduced
survival  of  larval  marine  species,  including  commercial  fish  and  shellfish.  As  ocean
pH  decreases,  the  amount  of  available  calcium  carbonate  decreases.  Many  marine
organisms require calcium carbonate to produce their shells and exoskeletons. Calci-
fying organisms include coral, mollusks, echinoderms and crustaceans.

The  U.S.  is  the  third  largest  seafood  consumer  in  the  world—total  consumer
spending  for  fish  and  shellfish  is  approximately  $60  billion  per  year.  Coastal  and
marine  commercial  fishing  generates  as  much  as  $30  billion  per  year  and  nearly
70,000 jobs. The organisms likely to be impacted by ocean acidity include both com-
mercially important groups (e.g., clams, oyster, crab, shrimp, and lobster) and orga-
nisms  that  serve  as  primary  food  sources  for  other  commercially  important  species.
Healthy  coral  reefs  are  the  foundation  of  many  of  these  viable  fisheries,  as  well  as
the  source  of  tourism  and  recreation  revenues.  Changes  to  the  stability  of  coastal
reefs  may  reduce  the  protection  they  offer  to  coastal  communities  against  storm
surges and hurricanes.

Many  fisheries  are  also  under  stress  from  over  fishing,  pollution,  diseases,  and

changes in water temperature.

Changes  to  the  ocean’s  chemistry  can  be  so  long-lasting  that  they  are  basically
irreversible once begun. According to the Royal Society of London’s report,3 it would
take  ten  thousand  years  for  the  oceans’  pH  to  return  to  their  pre-industrial  level.
Chemical  additives  to  the  ocean  to  restore  pH  are  unproven  and  could  have  many
unintended consequences to ocean ecology and climate.

Current Federal Research and Monitoring Programs on Ocean Acidification

Although  there  are  projects  being  funded  through  several  federal  agencies  and
some  initial  workshops  and  meetings  have  been  organized  to  identify  key  research
areas,  there  is  no  coordinated  plan  of  research  in  place  with  identified  funding  to
ensure  that  all  aspects  of  ocean  acidification  are  being  monitored  and  explored  to
provide  a  comprehensive  picture  of  this  phenomenon.  H.R.  4174  is  intended  to  pro-
vide  a  statutory  structure  to  ensure  ongoing  coordination  of  the  relevant  agencies
to  develop  a  comprehensive  federal  research,  monitoring  and  assessment  program
to  address  the  impacts  of  ocean  acidification.  A  few  of  the  recent  activities  under-
taken by federal agencies are provided below.

NSF, NOAA, NASA, and USGS have been working to develop and coordinate indi-
vidual  agency  programs  on  ocean  acidification.  These  efforts  also  involve  the  aca-
demic  research  community  and  international  partners.  Japan,  Korea,  Canada  and
the  European  Union  are  also  developing  research  and  monitoring  efforts  to  better
understand  ocean  acidification.  The  agencies  produced  a  workshop  report:  Impacts
of  Ocean  Acidification  on  Coral  Reefs  and  Other  Marine  Calcifiers:  A  Guide  for  Fu-
ture Research. NSF supported a workshop convened by Scripps Institution of Ocean-
ography  in  October  2007  to  discuss  potential  ocean  acidification  research  projects
and to identify key gaps in knowledge about ocean acidification and its potential im-
pacts.

Through these efforts the following key research and monitoring needs have been
identified:  Monitoring  of  the  changing  ocean  chemistry  and  biological  impacts  at

in  response  to  ocean  acidification;  Research  to  understand  the  species-specific
physiological  response  of  marine  organisms  to  ocean  acidification  and  develop  envi-
ronmental  and  ecological  indices  that  track  marine  ecosystem  responses  to  ocean

There  are  several  federal  monitoring  and  research  projects  underway.  The  Na-
tional Science Foundation recently awarded a grant through its Biocomplexity in the
Environment  area  to  support  deployment  of  the  first  buoy  to  monitor  ocean  acidifi-
cation in collaboration with scientists at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Lab-
oratory in Washington and scientists at several universities. The buoy was launched
in the Gulf of Alaska last year and will measure air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide,
oxygen and nitrogen gases and it will measure pH of surface seawater.

In  2005,  NSF  and  NOAA  collaborated  on  a  cruise  to  collect  field  data  on  ocean
acidification in the Pacific Ocean from the southern to the northern hemispheres as
part of a long-term, cooperative hydrographic study. The results indicated decreases
in pH and increases in dissolved inorganic carbon, both indicators of ocean acidifica-
tion.

NSF is also supporting individual extramural academic research projects on ocean
acidification  topics  through  several  of  its  directorates  and  programs.  For  example,
Dr. Victoria Fabry is leading a team to study a species of marine snail to determine
how  changes  in  seawater  chemistry  may  impact  its  ability  to  extract  calcium  from
seawater to form its shell and other impacts on its physiology.

Chairman LAMPSON. Well, good morning. This hearing will come
to order. I welcome to today’s hearing all of you on this hearing on
the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act, H.R.
4174.

We  have  heard  that  climate  change  will  have  tremendous  con-
sequences  for  our  environment,  and  today  we  will  learn  about  one
of these in detail, ocean acidification.

The oceans cover over 70 percent of the Earth’s surface and have
absorbed as much as 50 percent of our carbon emissions during the
past 200 years.

As we will hear from our witnesses today, the addition of this ex-
cess carbon dioxide has altered the equilibrium between the atmos-
phere and the ocean, and it is making seawater more acidic.

Ocean acidification poses a threat to many marine organisms and
ocean  ecosystems.  It  reduces  the  ability  of  shellfish  and  corals  to
form their shells and skeletons. It impacts the health and survival
of  other  organisms  that  are  part  of  the  food  chain  supporting  fish
and marine mammals.

Coral  reefs  and  many  of  our  fisheries  are  already  compromised
by  over  fishing,  disease,  pollution,  and  rising  water  temperatures.
Ocean  acidification  is  yet  another  stress  that  could  dramatically
and permanently alter our ocean environments.

H.R. 4174 introduced by our colleague from Maine, Congressman
Tom  Allen,  and  co-sponsored  by  two  Members  of  this  committee,
Mr.  Baird  and  Mr.  Ehlers,  is  intended  to  coordinate  and  expand
the  efforts  of  the  Federal  Government  to  expand  our  knowledge  of
ocean  acidification.  Through  more  comprehensive  monitoring  and
research we can begin to develop strategies to address the impacts
of these changes on our fisheries and ocean ecosystems.

We  have  a  distinguished  panel  of  experts  here  with  us  today.  I
look forward to their testimony and your recommendations of what
the  Federal  Government  can  do  to  address  this  serious  issue  and
preserve the productivity and diversity of our oceans.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Lampson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

Good  morning.  I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  today’s  hearing  on  The  Federal

Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act: H.R. 4174.

In  this  committee  we  have  heard  that  climate  change  will  have  tremendous  con-
sequences  for  our  environment  and  today  we  will  learn  about  one  of  these  in  de-
tail—ocean acidification.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere dissolves in our oceans causing the pH
of the ocean to decrease. Our oceans are our largest environment, covering over sev-
enty  percent  of  the  Earth’s  surface  and  have  absorbed  as  much  as  fifty  percent  of
our carbon emissions during the past two hundred years.

Our  oceans,  however,  are  not  simply  a  convenient  CO2 storage  sink.  As  we  will
hear  from  our  witnesses  today,  too  much  CO2 disrupts  the  healthy  equilibrium  be-
tween our atmosphere and oceans.

The  pH  of  the  ocean  decreasing  poses  a  threat  to  the  most  delicate  ocean  eco-
systems.  For  example,  it  reduces  the  ability  of  coral,  shrimp,  lobsters,  and  crab,  to
grow their shells and structures.

The  changing  ocean  environment  is  likely  to  threaten  not  only  these  species,  but
impact  the  health  of  other  ecosystems  that  support  the  food  chain  of  fish,  shrimp
and  our  larger  marine  organisms.  For  example,  coral  reefs,  around  the  world  and
off the coast of my home State of Texas, are already compromised by rising tempera-
tures and land run off. Ocean acidification is yet another event that could dramati-
cally and permanently alter our ocean environments.

While  this  committee  cannot  regulate  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  we  can  aid  the

science and research to understand our changing world.

I  am  pleased  we  are  here  today  to  discuss  H.R.  4174.  The  Act  was  introduced  by
our  colleague  from  Maine,  Congressman  Tom  Allen,  and  is  sponsored  by  two  Mem-
bers  of  this  committee  from  both  sides  of  the  aisle,  Mr.  Baird  and  Mr.  Ehlers,  and
our guest from Energy and Commerce, Mr. Inslee.

I  am  looking  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  today  on  what  the  Federal
Government  should  be  doing  to  strengthen  the  research  in  order  to  understand  the
ecological state and consequences of ocean acidification.

Chairman LAMPSON. At this time I would like to yield to my dis-
tinguished  colleague  from  South  Carolina,  our  Ranking  Member,
Mr. Inglis, for an opening statement.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  appreciate  you  holding

this hearing.

On  our  way  to  Antarctica  this  past  January,  our  Science  Com-
mittee  CODEL  stopped  for  a  day  in  Australia  to  visit  the  Great
Barrier  Reef.  Scientists  there  gave  us  a  primer  on  the  effects  of
ocean  acidification  on  coral  reefs.  As  climate  change  debate  con-
tinues, it is essential for us to focus not only on atmospheric effects
but also on the oceanic implications as well, understanding that the
ocean  holds  tremendously  valuable  resources  for  the  world’s  econ-
omy and environment.

The  Federal  Government  is  currently  working  to  address  ocean
acidification on a number of fronts. Programs such as NSF, NOAA,
NASA, and USGS all have individual efforts to work to understand
the changing ocean chemistry and its biological impacts. H.R. 4174,
the  Federal  Ocean  Acidification  Research  and  Monitoring  Act,
would  organize  and  coordinate  these  efforts  into  a  comprehensive
research, monitoring, and assessment program.

The  effects  of  ocean  acidification  I  witnessed  first  hand  in  Aus-
tralia  highlight  the  necessity  that  this  research  should  also  be  in
a global undertaking. The European Union is launching the ‘‘Euro-
pean  Project  of  Ocean  Acidification’’  next  week  in  Paris.  This
project has been put together to fill in the many gaps of our under-
standing of the impacts and ramifications of ocean acidification. As
we  move  forward,  I  would  hope  that  our  research  agenda  reflects
the  fact  that  this  is  an  international  issue  and  encourages  our  sci-
entists to work with their colleagues overseas.

Thank you, again, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to hearing from
our witnesses on their perspectives on this legislation and any sug-
gestions they may have to make improvements.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Thank you for holding this hearing, Mr. Chairman.
On  our  way  to  Antarctica  this  past  January,  our  CODEL  stopped  for  a  day  in
Australia  to  visit  the  Great  Barrier  Reef.  Scientists  there  gave  us  a  primer  on  the
effects of ocean acidification on coral reefs. As the climate change debate continues,
it is essential for us to focus not only on atmospheric effects, but on the oceanic im-
plications  as  well,  understanding  that  the  ocean  holds  valuable  resources  for  our
economy and environment.

The  Federal  Government  is  currently  working  to  address  ocean  acidification  on
many  fronts.  Programs  such  as  NSF,  NOAA,  NASA,  and  USGS  all  have  individual
efforts  at  work  to  understand  the  changing  ocean  chemistry  and  its  biological  im-
pacts.  H.R.  4174,  the  Federal  Ocean  Acidification  Research  and  Monitoring  Act,
would  organize  and  coordinate  these  efforts  into  a  comprehensive  research,  moni-
toring and assessment program.

The effects of ocean acidification I witnessed first-hand in Australia highlights the
necessity  that  this  research  should  also  be  a  global  undertaking.  The  European
Union  is  launching  the  ‘‘European  Project  of  Ocean  Acidification’’  next  week  in

standing  of  the  impacts  and  ramifications  of  ocean  acidification.  As  we  move  for-

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today, as this is an important
opportunity  to  learn  more  about  the  affects  of  carbon  dioxide  on  our  environment
and  more  specifically,  our  oceans.  As  Congress  considers  climate  change  legislation
in the future, this committee will undoubtedly examine the legislative options avail-
able to address the affects of global warming. It is important to understand how car-
bon dioxide affects all aspects of our planet, and I’m pleased that our witnesses are
here today to further discuss this issue.

Although  government  research  does  exist  on  the  acidification  of  oceans  and  the
living environment they support, it is clear that we have only scratched the surface.
As  researchers  and  as  policy-makers,  we  do  not  know  enough  about  the  effects  of
CO2 on our ecosystems.

With the rising energy costs in our country, there is an increasing urgency to find
clean,  renewable  sources  of  energy  that  have  a  zero  carbon  footprint.  With  better
research  and  the  tools  to  address  this  issue,  the  better  prepared  we  will  be  to  de-
velop  technologies  that  will  yield  a  steady,  stable  source  of  energy.  During  my  ten-
ure  on  this  committee  and  throughout  my  time  in  Congress,  I  have  been  a  strong
supporter of Carbon Capture Sequestration technology, so that we can use domestic
sources of energy safely, without harm to our ecosystems.

It  is  clear  from  our  witnesses  today  that  the  scientific  community  is  well-poised
to  take  advantage  of  this  bill.  The  programs  that  would  begin  under  H.R.  4174
would  finally  allow  for  a  federally-directed  and  federally-funded  program  to  build
upon the existing ocean acidification research.

I’m  confident  that  the  scientific  community  would  yield  results  that  would  prove
useful  to  help  create  the  innovative  technology  solutions  that  we  will  need  to  help
solve  the  problem  of  carbon  dioxide  and  global  warming.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  look  for-
ward to our witnesses’ testimony today and I yield back.

Panel I:

Chairman LAMPSON. At this time I would like to yield to my dis-
tinguished colleague from Washington, Mr. Baird, to introduce our
first panel.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  would  like  to  invite  my
dear  friend  and  colleague,  Mr.  Inslee,  up  to  the  desk  there,  and  I
want to introduce him. It is a real pleasure to introduce somebody
who  had  led  this  Congress  in  its  efforts  on  global  warming  and
ocean acidification.

As  many  of  us  know,  this  is  the  shameless  plug  part,  but  it  is
warranted.  Mr.  Inslee  is  the  author  of  ‘‘Apollo’s  Fire,’’  which  I  un-
derstand  has  sold  over  10,000  copies,  and  I  am  glad  that  it  has.  I
hope  it  sells  many  more,  because  it  is  a  comprehensive  and  very
positive look at what we can do to reduce ocean acidification. I had
the  privilege  of  traveling  with  Mr.  Inglis  last  year  the  Great  Bar-
rier Reef. We know how important it is there. Mr. Inslee has been
involved in following up on some of the studies of the Great North-
west,  where  we  are  also  having  acidification  problems,  and  I  see

some  folks  here  in  the  room  who  are  part  of  the  meeting  that  just
kicked  off  yesterday,  Ocean  Week,  here  on  the  Capitol.  It  is  tre-
mendously appropriate we are having this hearing today.

I think, Mr. Chairman, that at some point people may look back
on  this  hearing  and  on  all  the  other  things  that  are  going  on  the
Capitol  today  and  during  the  next  few  months,  this  hearing  may
be addressing one of the most grave threats to all of humanity and
to  our  planet,  and  I  am  grateful  for  your  leadership  and  calling  it
and  grateful  for  Mr.  Inslee  for  his  presence  as  with  all  the  other
witnesses here.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Congressman  Inslee,  you  are  recognized  to

make your statement.

STATEMENT OF HON. JAY INSLEE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN

CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

Mr.  INSLEE.  Thank  you,  and  I  appreciate  Mr.  Baird’s  shameless
plug for my book. We were going to cast Harrison Ford in the lead
of  ‘‘Apollo’s  Fire,’’  the  movie,  but  we  are  now  going  to  cast  Con-
gressman Brian Baird as the male lead in the movie.

Mr. BAIRD. If you make it, I want to be in it.
Mr. INSLEE. No, no. We have some roles for everyone. And every-

one does have a role in this revolution actually.

I  want  to  thank  the  Chair  and  Ranking  Member  Inglis  for  hold-
ing  this  hearing.  I  agree  with  Mr.  Baird  that  this  really  could  be
the  largest  issue  we  are  going  to  grapple  with  in  the  next  several
decades.  And  just  on  a  personal  observation  how  I  came  to  be
aware  of  it,  you  know,  for  years  I  have  been  doing  quite  a  bit  of
reading  about  global  warming,  back  to,  you  know,  mid  1990s,  and
I  have  been  trying  to  keep  abreast  of  the  science  involving  global
warming.  And  for  years  I  thought  this  was  a  wonderful  phe-
nomenon  because  the  oceans  were  sucking  up  what  I  called  excess
CO2 out  of  the  atmosphere,  and  you  know,  sequestering  it  in  the
ocean so we could get it out of that atmosphere and reduce the im-
pact of the climactic system.

So  for  a  long  period  of  time  I  thought  this  was  a  blessing  that
the  oceans  were  a  sponge  for  carbon  dioxide,  until  May  9,  2006,
when Ken Caldeira, another scientist, came to us here in Congress
and said, this is great, except it is creating acidic conditions in the
ocean,  and  we  have  now  had  a  30  percent  increase  in  ions  associ-
ated with the acidic and corrosive activities in the ocean.

And  the  reason  I  mention  this  is  that  this  is  kind  of  a  tell-tale
reason why climactic changes and CO2 is so dangerous. None of us,
at  least  I  did  not  see  this  as  a  problem  until  just  the  last  year  or
two,  and  it  shows  you  how  this,  when  we  mess  with  Mother  Na-
ture,  it  can  bite  us  big  time  in  ways  that  we  do  not  understand,
because we still have such a primitive understanding of the carbon
dioxide  cycle  and  what  it  does  throughout  these  multiple  systems,
biological and geological and otherwise.

So I think this is a perfect example of the danger associated with
CO2 and  the  atmosphere  that  we  still  don’t  understand  exactly
what it is doing.

So  obviously  this  is  a  problem  that  we  need  better  scientific
knowledge about. We had a hearing in Seattle led by Senator Cant-
well on this last week or the week before last, and we are very con-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:41 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042610 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\060508\42610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

cerned about this in the Puget Sound region, because we are so in-
timately  involved.  You  know,  the  iconic  restaurant  in  Seattle  is
Ivers Acres of Clams, and Ivers said, when the tide is out, the table
is  set  with  clams  and  oysters.  And  that  may  not  be  the  case  in
Puget  Sound  in  the  next  century  as  conditions  become  so  acidic
that it can retard the ability to form a calcium carbonate structure
which could hurt all the clam and oyster lovers like myself.

But to me, I will just tell you here is what really does terrify me,
even  on  a  deeper  basis  that  may  cause  oyster  farms  to  be  in  trou-
ble,  is  that  30  percent  of  the  world’s  bottom  of  the  food  chain,  the
zooplankton,  form  some  calcium  carbonate  structure.  And  at  some
point  it  becomes  difficult  for  those  little  critters  to  form  calcium,
and  that  is  the  base  of  the  entire  food  chain,  upon  which,  you
know, seven to 10 percent of our protein internationally comes from
and which the whales depend on ultimately.

So the whole food chain of the ocean, I believe, is at risk at some
level.  We  don’t  know  exactly  where  that  level  is.  The  biology  is
very,  it  is  in  its  very  early  stages  to  figure  that  out,  but  we  had
a scientist there in Seattle two weeks ago say she has actually seen
a shell dissolve in corrosive water of the types that we will find the
next  century  or  so  if  things  do  not  change.  And  we  have  seen  the
devastation  the  coral  reefs  are  already  experiencing,  and  the  sci-
entists will talk about that.

So in an answer to that I hope that we can move a bill that will
try to develop a more, a systematic approach to federal research on
how  to  really  tackle  this  problem.  We  have  been  very  lucky  that
some of the scientists today almost volunteered their time to go re-
search  this.  We  were  lucky  to  dodge  this  bullet.  We  did  not  have
an  organized  sentinel  on  duty  for  the  Federal  Government  to  look
for  this  problem.  We  need  to  have  an  organized  federal  approach
to this, and this bill is one approach on how to do that, and I know
there  are  things  we  can  talk  about  how  to  make  it  perfect,  but  we
need  to  have  some  systematic,  scientific  approach  to  this,  both  on
a national and ultimately international level. And I think that this
bill is one step forward to accomplish this.

So we should not be blind-sided by this or anything else, and we
were  lucky  to  have  these  men  and  women  working  for  us.  They
were  the  minute  men  and  women,  but  now  we  need  a  more  orga-
nized  approach.  And  I  hope  that  this  bill  will  help  move  that  for-
ward.

So  thank  you  for  your  farsightedness  in  holding  this  hearing.

Any questions, happy to oblige.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Inslee.  I  don’t

have questions. Does anyone wish to question?

Yes, sir. You are recognized.
Mr. AKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me try and get a little

bit of the basic science of the concern.

I assume when you talk about more CO2 in the atmosphere then
as  the  rain  comes  down,  it  picks  it  up,  turns  it  into  carbonic  acid,
and  that  goes  into  the  ocean.  So  it  is  a  form  of  sort  of  acid  rain.
It  is  not  a  sulfuric  type  of  stuff,  but  it  is  more  of  a  carbonic  acid.

Mr. INSLEE. Yes. You better defer to the real scientific——

that.

And  then  that  changes  the  pH  of  the  ocean.  Is  that  the  basic  con-
cern mechanically of what is going on?

Mr.  INSLEE.  Given  my  test  scores  in  freshman  chemistry,  I  may
not  be  the  proper  person  to  ask  that  question  to,  but  generally
speaking,  yes.  I  actually  don’t  know  if  it  is  conveyed  through  rain
or  just  some  partial  pressure  driving  the  CO2 to  go  into  solution,
and  the  chemists  behind  me  will  answer  that.  And  I  should  point
out  that  when  we  say  it  becomes  more  acidic,  it  actually  becomes
less  base,  because  the  ocean  is  actually  in  base  conditions,  and  it
reduces  the  pH,  a  very  small  number.  On  a  logarithmic  scale  that
is about a 30 percent increase in those ions that would be, ‘‘acidic.’’
So  it  is  definitely  a  corrosive,  though,  for  biological,  anything
forming a calcium-base system, and that is where the real problem
is. So I hope that I didn’t cloud it too much.

Mr.  AKIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  it  is  okay,  is  there  somebody  else

who wanted to go a little further?

Dr. Bartlett.
Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much.
Carbon dioxide, of course, is very soluble in water, and the colder
the  water  the  higher  the  solubility.  We  require  something  like  10
percent  oxygen,  and  we  have  about  almost  21  percent,  we  can
make  due  at  10  percent,  but  our  plants  at  the  other  side  of  this
cycle,  they  have  less  than  .04  percent  CO2.  If  you  are  a  rose  fan,
you  are  growing  them  in  the  greenhouse,  you  put  a  tank  of  CO2
in there, and you crack the valve because they get starved for CO2
shortly in the wintertime.

The ocean, of course, has two kinds of plankton, the zooplankton
you  mentioned,  which  may  be  adversely  affected  by  higher  CO2,
but  the  phytoplankton  should  be  happier  with  high  CO2.  The
oceans  will  certainly  be  different  with  higher  CO2,  and  I  am  won-
dering  what  that  ultimate  balance  might  be.  The  phytoplankton  is
going to do better, it is going to grow faster with higher CO2 levels.
There may be some impediment to the, some of the things that the
zooplankton  need  to  do,  but  it  will  be  a  very  different  world.  And
I  don’t  know  whether  it  will  be  a  worse  world  or  not,  but  it  will
certainly  be  different,  and  there  is  a  risk  that  it  could  be  worse.

So thank you very much for your——
Mr.  INSLEE.  I  appreciate  that.  I  think  that  is  a  really  important
point. The answer is obviously we don’t know what, you know, the
differences  will  be.  One  of  the  scientists  at  this  hearing  in  Seattle
basically  said  that  it  is  at  least  a  substantial  likelihood  that  there
will be species substitution. You will have niches in the food chain
that may be filled by different species, but that is not exactly a be-
nign answer, because I don’t think my constituents are going to be
happy about a fishing season on jellyfish as opposed to a season on
salmon.

And that is one of the situations, and by the way, there is, I am
told  that  there  is  some  things  going  on  there  right  now.  There  is

a  profusion  of  jellyfish  going  on  in  the  oceans.  I  don’t  know  what
the reason for that it is, but, yes, important point.

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. INSLEE. Thank you.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Dr. Bartlett.
Mr.  BAIRD.  Mr.  Chair,  perhaps  one  of  our  later  witnesses  could

comment on the profusion of jellyfish in this institution as well.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you for that insight.
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Inslee, thank you——
Mr.  MCNERNEY.  I  just  want  to  say,  I  have  been  here  for  about
a  year  and  a  half,  and  I  have  worked  with  Mr.  Inslee  on  global
warming issues. He has shown a lot of leadership, and I appreciate
your  coming  and  testifying  before  us  today.  I  think  you  are  doing
a great job.

Mr.  INSLEE.  And  I  am  often  wrong  but  never  in  doubt,  as  you

Chairman LAMPSON. Well, we think that you are doing a tremen-

know.

dous job——

Mr. INSLEE. Thank you, Mr.——
Chairman LAMPSON.—keeping this on our minds and raising the

awareness of the world. So, thank you very much, Mr. Inslee.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, can I say——
Chairman LAMPSON. Yes.
Ms. WOOLSEY.—nice things about my colleague?
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Certainly  you  may,  Ms.  Woolsey.  You  are

recognized. Just don’t say anything too nice.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Jay, I want to say nice things about you.
Mr. INSLEE. Okay. I will listen.
Ms.  WOOLSEY.  All  I  can  tell  you  is  every  time  we  start  talking
about our Democratic position on global warming and energy, I say,
has anybody asked Jay Inslee. So we need to pay attention to what
he  is  saying.  He  is  a  guru,  and  he  is  going  to  be  a  huge  part  of
what goes right.

Mr.  INSLEE.  I  really  appreciate  that.  Let  me  just  say  one  thing.
I  do  want  to  say,  though,  we  are  not  going  to  apparently  pass  the
cap and trade system. It would be the first step in an effort to deal
with these kind of problems this year. I just want to say that I am
optimistic  about  our  ability  on  a  bipartisan,  international,  multi-
level approach to solve this problem.

I  do  believe  it  is  the  largest  problem  humanity  has  faced  at  one
time  internationally  ever.  There  has  never  been  a  problem  that
people  have  ever  shared  all  the  way  around  the  world  other  than
this  one,  and  we  all  share  this  everywhere  in  the  world.  And  I  be-
lieve  it  is  going  to  unite  the  world  eventually.  I  believe  it  is  going
to be a significant cause for economic growth, because the problems
we are talking about here have a solution to technologies, which we
can create in this country.

And I was just in Napa, California, two weeks ago, meeting with
the venture capital community and a bunch of CEOs who are build-
ing  the  technologies  today  to  grow  the  U.S.  economy  that  will  also
stop  ocean  acidification.  And  I  think  we  should  be  optimistic  and
very  American  and  bullish  on  our  ability  to  solve  this,  and  I  look
forward to it.

STATEMENT OF DR. RICHARD A. FEELY, SUPERVISORY CHEM-

LABORATORY,  OFFICE  OF  OCEANIC  AND  ATMOSPHERIC  RE-
SEARCH,  NATIONAL  OCEANIC  AND  ATMOSPHERIC  ADMINIS-
TRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
Dr. FEELY. Good morning, Chairman Lampson, Ranking Member
Inglis, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for giving me
the  opportunity  to  discuss  ocean  acidification  and  the  Administra-
tion’s views on H.R. 4174.

Over  the  past  two  centuries  the  oceans  have  absorbed  approxi-
mately 525 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The
ocean’s daily uptake of 22 million tons of carbon dioxide is starting
to  have  a  significant  affect  on  the  chemistry  and  biology  of  the
oceans. Hydrographic surveys and modeling studies reveal that the
chemistry changes in seawater resulting from absorption of carbon
dioxide are increasing the acidity of the seawater.

Furthermore, future predictions indicate the oceans will continue
to absorb carbon dioxide and become more acidic. It is now well es-
tablished  that  our  ocean  surface  waters  have  increased  in  acidity
by about 30 percent.

Future  predictions  of  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  concentrations
indicate  by  the  middle  of  the  century  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide
levels  could  reach  500  parts  per  million  and  near  the  end  of  the
century  could  be  as  high  as  800  parts  per  million.  This  will  result
in the ocean becoming approximately 150 percent more acidic.

To  this  point  in  historical  perspective  this  increase  in  surface
ocean acidity will result in the oceans being more acidic than it has
been  for  over  20  million  years.  The  increase  in  ocean  acidification

has significant affects on many marine ecosystems and species. For
example,  increased  ocean  acidification  significantly  reduces  ability
of reforming corals to produce their skeletons. This affects the indi-
vidual coral’s growth rates and makes the reefs more vulnerable to
erosion.

Ongoing  research  is  showing  that  the  increased  ocean  acidifica-
tion  may  also  harm  commercially-important  fish  and  shellfish  lar-
vae. Scientists have also seen a reduced ability of marine algae and
free-flowing plants and animals to produce the protective carbonate
shells.  The  effects  of  ocean  acidification  on  coral  reef  ecosystems
and  fisheries  could  reverberate  throughout  the  entire  U.S.  and
global economy.

Ocean acidification is an important new scientific frontier. NOAA
research  activities  offer  significant  contributions  to  improving  our
understanding  and  assessing  the  impacts  of  this  rapidly-emerging
issue.  NOAA’s  ocean  acidification  research  falls  into  three  main
categories;  observations,  physiological  effects  on  marine  species,
and modeling efforts.

An  example  I  would  like  to  share  with  some  of  you,  the  new  re-
search  that  we  have  acquired  this  past  year.  NOAA’s  Pacific  Ma-
rine  Environmental  Laboratory  carries  out  ocean  observations.
Their carbon dioxide measurements on ships and monitoring buoys
provide  data  that  helps  NOAA  discern  seasonal  changes  in  the
ocean carbon system.

Recently  we  discovered  that  up  along  the  west  coast  of  North
America  is  drawing  corrosive,  acidic  waters  up  onto  the  Conti-
nental  Shelf.  This  process  happens  during  the  spring  and  summer
months  when  the  winds  push  surface  waters  away  from  the  coast
and draw CO2-rich waters on the Continental Shelf in very shallow
waters.  In  fact,  we  observed  some  of  the  coastal  waters  had  actu-
ally  up-welled  all  the  way  to  the  surface  off  the  northern  coast  of
California.

These  findings  are  quite  surprising.  No  one  considered  that  up-
welling  of  corrosive  waters  offshore  would  make  the  waters  on  our
Continental  Shelf  so  vulnerable  to  ocean  acidification  on  the
timescales  that  the  models  have  provided  thus  far.  Our  findings
represent the first evidence that a large section of the North Amer-
ican  Continental  Shelf  is  seasonally  impacted  by  ocean  acidifica-
tion.  This  means  that  ocean  acidification  may  be  seriously  impact-
ing marine life on our Continental Shelf right now.

The introduction of H.R. 4174 reflects recommendations from the
national scientific community for coordination of scientific research
on  this  issue.  The  scientific  community  has  identified  four  major
themes for a research program. These include carbon system moni-
toring,  calcification  and  physiological  response  studies,  environ-
ment and ecosystem modeling, and socioeconomic risk assessments.
This  research  will  provide  resource  managers  with  the  basic  infor-
mation they need to develop strategies for protection of critical spe-
cies, habitats, and ecosystems.

With  support  and  we  support  the  intent  of  H.R.  4174  to  develop
an ocean acidification research and monitoring plan and appreciate
the interests of this committee on this research area. As part of our
mission  NOAA  has  a  strong  foundation  of  ocean  acidification  re-
search.  We  will  be  able  to  provide  strong  leadership  for  federal

inter-agency effort examining ocean acidification across the Federal
Government.

Because  of  the  very  potential  for  ocean-wide  effects  of  ocean
acidification  at  all  levels  of  the  marine  ecosystem,  we  can  expect
to see significant effects that are of immense importance to human-
kind. Ocean acidification is an emerging scientific issue, and much
research is needed before ecosystem species responses are well un-
derstood.

Thank  you  for  giving  me  this  opportunity  to  address  this  com-

mittee, and I look forward to your questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD A. FEELY

Introduction

Chairman  Lampson  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  giving  me
the opportunity to speak with you today on ocean acidification and the Administra-
tion’s views on H.R. 4174, the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring
Act  of  2007.  My  name  is  Richard  Feely.  I  am  a  Supervisory  Chemical  Oceanog-
rapher at the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  in  Seattle,  WA.  My  personal  area  of  research
is  the  study  of  the  oceanic  carbon  cycle  and  ocean  acidification  processes.  I  have
worked for NOAA for 34 years and have published more than 165 peer-reviewed sci-
entific journal articles, book chapters and technical reports. I serve on the U.S. Car-
bon  Cycle  Science  Program  Scientific  Steering  Group  and  I  am  the  co-chair  of  the
U.S. Repeat Hydrography Program Scientific Oversight Committee. I am also on the
International Scientific Advisory Panel for the European Program on Ocean Acidifi-
cation.

What is Ocean Acidification?

As the Committee is aware, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC)  has  documented,  global  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  to  the  atmosphere
have  increased  since  the  start  of  the  industrial  age.  What  happens  to  all  that  CO2
that  is  put  into  the  atmosphere?  Over  the  past  two  centuries,  the  oceans  have  ab-
sorbed  approximately  525  billion  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  from  the  atmosphere,  or
about  one  third  of  the  anthropogenic  carbon  emissions  released  during  this  period
(Sabine  and  Feely,  2007).  This  natural  process  of  absorption  has  benefited  human-
kind by significantly reducing the greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere and miti-
gating  some  of  the  impacts  of  global  warming.  However,  the  ocean’s  current  daily
uptake  of  22  million  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  is  starting  to  have  a  significant  impact
on the chemistry and biology of the oceans.

Over the last three decades, NOAA, the National Science Foundation and the De-
partment of Energy have co-sponsored repeat hydrographic and chemical surveys of
the world oceans, documenting the ocean’s response to increasing amounts of carbon
dioxide  being  emitted  to  the  atmosphere  by  human  activities.  These  surveys  have
confirmed  the  oceans  are  absorbing  increasing  amounts  of  carbon  dioxide.  Both  the
hydrographic  surveys  and  modeling  studies  reveal  that  chemical  changes  in  sea-
water  resulting  from  absorption  of  carbon  dioxide  are  increasing  the  acidity  of  sea-
water  (or,  lowering  its  pH,  the  scale  used  to  measure  acidity).  Scientists  have  esti-
mated  that  the  pH  of  our  ocean  surface  waters  has  already  fallen  by  about  0.11
units  from  an  average  of  about  8.21  to  8.10  since  the  beginning  of  the  industrial
revolution  (a  drop  in  pH  indicates  an  increase  in  acidity,  as  on  the  logarithmic  pH
scale  7.0  is  neutral,  with  points  lower  on  the  scale  being  ‘‘acidic’’  and  points  higher
on  the  scale  being  ‘‘basic’’;  Raven  et  al.,  2005).  Further,  future  predictions  indicate
that  the  oceans  will  continue  to  absorb  CO2 and  become  more  acidic.  Estimates  of
future  atmospheric  and  oceanic  carbon  dioxide  concentrations,  based  on  the  IPCC
emission scenarios and numerical circulation models, indicate that by the middle of
this century atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could reach more than 500 parts per
million  (ppm),  and  near  the  end  of  the  century  they  could  be  over  800  ppm  (Orr
et al., 2005). This would result in a surface water pH decrease of approximately 0.4
pH  units  as  the  ocean  becomes  more  acidic.  To  put  this  in  historical  perspective,
the  resulting  surface  ocean  pH  would  be  lower  than  it  has  been  for  more  than  20
million years (Feely et al., 2004).

Effects of Ocean Acidification on Coral Reefs

Many marine organisms that produce calcium carbonate shells are negatively im-
pacted by increasing carbon dioxide levels in seawater (and the resultant decline in
pH). For example, increasing ocean acidification has been shown to significantly re-
duce  the  ability  of  reef-building  corals  to  produce  their  skeletons,  affecting  growth
of individual corals and making the reef more vulnerable to erosion (Kleypas et al.,
2006).  Some  estimates  indicate  that,  by  the  end  of  this  century,  coral  reefs  may
erode faster than they can be rebuilt. This could compromise the long-term viability
of  these  ecosystems  and  perhaps  impact  the  thousands  of  species  that  depend  on
the reef habitat. Decreased calcification may also compromise the fitness or success
of  these  organisms  and  could  shift  the  competitive  advantage  towards  organisms
that  are  not  dependent  on  calcium  carbonate.  Carbonate  structures  are  likely  to  be
weaker  and  more  susceptible  to  dissolution  and  erosion  in  a  more  acidic  environ-
ment.  In  long-term  laboratory  and  mesocosm  experiments  corals  that  have  been
grown  under  lower  pH  conditions  for  periods  longer  than  one  year  have  not  shown
any  ability  to  adapt  their  calcification  rates  to  the  low  pH  levels.  In  fact,  a  recent
study showed that the projected increase in CO2 is sufficient to dissolve the calcium
carbonate skeletons of some coral species (Fine and Tchernov, 2007).

Effects of Ocean Acidification on Fish and Shellfish

Ongoing research is showing that decreasing pH may also have deleterious effects
on  commercially  important  fish  and  shellfish  larvae.  Both  king  crab  and  silver
seabream  larvae  exhibit  very  high  mortality  rates  in  CO2-enriched  waters
(Ishimatsu et al., 2004). Some of the experiments indicated that other physiological
stresses were also apparent. Exposure of fish to lower pH levels can cause decreased
respiration  rates,  changes  in  blood  chemistry,  and  changes  in  enzymatic  activity.
The  calcification  rates  of  the  edible  mussel  (Mytilus  edulis)  and  Pacific  oyster
(Crassostrea gigas) decline linearly with increasing CO2 levels (Gazeau et al., 2007).
Squid are especially sensitive to ocean acidification because it directly impacts their
blood  oxygen  transport  and  respiration  (Po¨rtner  et  al.,  2005).  Sea  urchins  raised  in
lower-pH  waters  show  evidence  for  inhibited  growth  due  to  their  inability  to  main-
tain internal acid-base balance (Kurihara and Shirayama, 2004). The food supply of
these  commercially  valuable  species  is  in  jeopardy  from  ocean  acidification.  Sci-
entists have also seen a reduced ability of marine algae and free-floating plants and
animals  to  produce  protective  carbonate  shells  (Feely  et  al.,  2004;  Orr  et  al.,  2005).
These  organisms  are  important  food  sources  for  other  marine  species.  One  type  of
free-swimming mollusk called a pteropod is eaten by organisms ranging in size from
tiny  krill  to  whales.  In  particular,  pteropods  are  a  major  food  source  for  North  Pa-
cific  juvenile  salmon,  and  also  serve  as  food  for  salmon,  mackerel,  pollock,  herring,
and  cod.  Other  marine  calcifiers,  such  as  coccolithophores  (microscopic  algae),  fo-
raminifera  (microscopic  protozoans),  coralline  algae  (benthic  algae),  echinoderms
(sea  urchins  and  starfish),  and  mollusks  (snails,  clams,  and  squid)  also  exhibit  a
general  decline  in  their  ability  to  produce  their  shells  with  decreasing  pH  (Kleypas
et al., 2006).

Effects on Marine Ecosystems

Since ocean acidification research is still in its infancy, it is impossible to predict
exactly  how  the  individual  species  responses  will  cascade  throughout  the  marine
food  chain  and  impact  the  overall  structure  of  marine  ecosystems.  It  is  clear,  how-
ever,  from  both  the  existing  data  and  from  the  geologic  record  that  some  coral  and
shellfish  species  will  be  negatively  impacted  in  a  high-CO2 ocean.  The  rapid  dis-
appearance of many calcifying species in past extinction events has been attributed,
in large part, to ocean acidification events (Zachos et al., 2005; Vernon, 2008). Over
the next century, if CO2 emissions are allowed to increase as predicted by the IPCC
CO2 emissions  scenarios,  mankind  may  be  responsible  for  increasing  oceanic  CO2
and  making  the  oceans  more  corrosive  to  calcifying  organisms  than  at  anytime  in
the  last  20  million  years.  Thus,  the  decisions  we  make  about  carbon  dioxide  emis-
sions  over  the  next  several  decades  will  probably  have  a  profound  influence  on  the
makeup of future marine ecosystems for centuries to millennia.

Potential Economic Impacts

The  impact  of  ocean  acidification  on  fisheries  and  coral  reef  ecosystems  could  re-
verberate through the U.S. and global economy. The U.S. is the third largest seafood
consumer  in  the  world  with  total  consumer  spending  for  fish  and  shellfish  around
$70  billion  per  year.  Coastal  and  marine  commercial  fishing  generates  upwards  of
$35  billion  per  year  and  employs  nearly  70,000  people  (NOAA  Fisheries  Office  of
Science  and  Technology;  http://www.st.nmfs.gov/st1/fus/fus05/index.html).  In-

creased  ocean  acidification  may  directly  or  indirectly  influence  the  fish  stocks  be-
cause of large-scale changes in the local ecosystem dynamics. It may also cause the
dissolution of the newly discovered deep water corals in the Alaskan Aleutian Island
region. Many commercially important fish species in this region depend on this par-
ticular habitat for their survival. Healthy coral reefs are the foundation of many via-
ble  fisheries,  as  well  as  the  source  of  jobs  and  businesses  related  to  tourism  and
recreation. In the Florida Keys, coral reefs attract more than $1.2 billion in tourism
annually.  In  Hawaii,  reef-related  tourism  and  fishing  generate  $360  million  per
year, and their overall worth has been estimated at close to $10 billion. In addition,
coral  reefs  provide  vital  protection  to  coastal  areas  that  are  vulnerable  to  storm
surges and tsunamis.

NOAA Ocean Acidification Research

Ocean acidification is an important new scientific frontier. NOAA research activi-
ties offer significant contributions to improving our understanding and assessing the
impacts  of  this  rapidly  emerging  issue.  NOAA  research  relevant  to  ocean  acidifica-
tion  falls  into  the  categories  of  ocean  observations,  studies  of  the  physiological  im-
pact  on  marine  species,  and  support  of  environmental  and  ecological  modeling  ef-
forts.

For example, some on going work includes the following:

• The Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory’s CO2 shipboard measure-
ments  and  monitoring  buoys  provide  data  that  helps  NOAA  discern  seasonal
changes in the oceanic carbon system.

• The  Atlantic  Oceanographic  and  Meteorological  Laboratory  monitors
changes  in  CO2 and  pH  through  the  use  of  chemical  sensors  on  ships  and
moorings.

• The  NOAA  Repeat  Hydrography  Program  provides  valuable  data  on  the
large-scale  changes  of  carbon  system  and  ocean  acidification  over  decadal
time scales.

• NOAA’s Coral Reef Conservation Program plans to conduct a study start-
ing in FY 2008 and continuing in FY 2009 to determine the impacts of global
climate change and coral bleaching on the recreation and tourism industry in
the Florida Keys.

• Sea  Grant  supports  research  on  the  affects  of  ocean  acidification  on  coral

reefs in Hawaii.

• The  Geophysical  Fluid  Dynamics  Laboratory  participated  in  the  Ocean-
Carbon  Cycle  Model  Intercomparison  Project  (OCMIP2)  to  develop  an  inter-
national collaboration to improve the predictive capacity of carbon cycle mod-
els through evaluation and intercomparison.

• NOAA  Fisheries  Alaska  Fisheries  Science  Center  has  been  conducting

exposure studies of blue king crab larval survival due to reduced pH.

• NOAA  Fisheries  Southwest  Fisheries  Science  Center  has  been  evalu-
ating  the  long-term  impacts  of  low  pH  on  marine  plankton  in  the  California
Current and off Antarctica.

• Projects funded by NOAA Global Carbon Cycle Program at NOAA labora-
tories and universities provide necessary information to address the CO2 and
pH changes in the ocean.

NOAA  Views  on  H.R.  4174,  the  Federal  Ocean  Acidification  Research  and

Monitoring Act of 2007

As noted in our views letter on S. 1581, the companion bill to H.R. 4174, the Ad-
ministration  supports  the  intent  of  the  Federal  Ocean  Acidification  Research  and
Monitoring  Act  of  2007,  to  develop  an  ocean  acidification  research  and  monitoring
plan,  and  appreciates  the  interest  of  the  Committee  on  this  area  of  research.  How-
ever, the bill creates an interagency committee that is largely redundant with exist-
ing government bodies.

In support of well-coordinated programs for climate change and ocean science and
technology,  the  Administration  created  two  interagency  bodies  under  the  National
Science and Technology Council—the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) and
the  Joint  Subcommittee  on  Ocean  Science  and  Technology  (JSOST).  Both  bodies
have  been  successful  in  reducing  the  duplication  of  efforts  in  research  programs,
identifying and addressing programmatic gaps, and synthesizing information for the

18

American  public.  Their  organizational  structure  supports  focused,  high-level  inter-
action among Departments and agencies.

As disconcerting as the ramifications of ocean acidification may be, we encourage
the  Committee  to  avoid  the  temptation  of  creating  interagency  committees  for  each
potential  impact  of  climate  change  and  rather  work  within  the  framework  of  exist-
ing institutions.

The  introduction  of  H.R.  4174  reflects  recommendation  of  the  national  and  inter-
national  scientific  communities  for  a  coordinated  scientific  research  program.  The
scientific  community  has  identified  four  major  themes  for  a  research  program:  (1)
carbon system monitoring; (2) calcification and physiological response studies under
laboratory  and  field  conditions;  (3)  environmental  and  ecosystem  modeling  studies;
and  (4)  socioeconomic  risk  assessments.  This  research  will  provide  resource  man-
agers  with  the  basic  information  they  need  to  develop  strategies  for  protection  of
critical  species,  habitats  and  ecosystems  (similar  to  what  has  already  been  devel-
oped  for  coral  reef  managers  with  the  publication  of  The  Reef  Manager’s  Guide  by
the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force to help local and regional reef managers reduce the
impacts of coral bleaching to coral reef ecosystems).

Ocean acidification is an emerging issue, and research and monitoring are of crit-
ical  importance  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  processes  involved.  NOAA  has  a
strong  foundation  in  ocean  acidification  research  and  as  such  would  be  able  to  pro-
vide strong leadership for an interagency effort examining ocean acidification across
the  Federal  Government.  Such  an  effort  would  support  NOAA’s  mission,  which  is
to  provide  information  to  understand  and  predict  changes  in  the  Earth’s  environ-
ment  and  conserve  and  manage  coastal  and  marine  resources  to  meet  the  Nation’s
economic,  social,  and  environmental  needs.  NOAA’s  unique  capacity  to  develop  and
deploy  ocean  observation  systems  can  support  further  examination  of  ocean  acidifi-
cation.

NOAA  has  already  begun  identifying  key  issues  related  to  the  potential  impacts
of ocean acidification on fisheries and ecosystems, and we are working with the Na-
tional Academy of Science’s Ocean Studies Board (OSB) to prioritize future research
and monitoring efforts. Science planning workshops and a university office to foster
academic research in ocean acidification (among other responsibilities) has also been
jointly funded by the National Science Foundation, National Aeronautics and Space
Administration,  and  NOAA.  It  is  important  that  NOAA  and  other  agencies  coordi-
nate  laboratory  studies  and  collaborate  in  the  design  of  appropriate  field  investiga-
tions.  This  will  allow  us  to  better  assess  the  threat  and  more  precisely  forecast  the
impacts  of  ocean  acidification  on  marine  ecosystems,  and  the  associated  socio-
economic consequences.

NOAA  believes  that  the  National  Academy  can  provide  an  important  bridge  be-
tween the academic community and federal agencies in designing and implementing
appropriate  long-term  cooperative  studies  and  experiments  to  determine  how  ma-
rine  ecosystems  may  respond  to  ocean  acidification.  A  planned  National  Academy
study, to be conducted through its OSB, will be used to help design long-term moni-
toring studies to monitor changes in carbonate chemistry in vulnerable marine eco-
systems  of  the  United  States,  and  as  a  method  to  collaborate  internationally.  The
OSB  will  provide  guidance  regarding  methods,  frequency,  and  placement  of  moni-
toring sensors and oceanographic sensing to track ocean acidification over time, and
in  relation  to  changes  in  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide.  This  work  will  be  important
in  influencing  the  interagency  committee  on  ocean  acidification  as  outlined  in  H.R.
4174.

We  note  that  many  of  the  timelines  established  by  H.R.  4174  for  production  of
plans  and  reports  appear  ambitious.  If  NOAA  is  to  consider  input  from  other  com-
mittees  and  panels  (e.g.,  the  National  Research  Council,  the  Ocean  Research  and
Resources  Advisory  Panel,  the  Joint  Subcommittee  on  Ocean,  Science,  and  Tech-
nology of the National Science and Technology Council, the Joint Ocean Commission
Initiative, and other expert scientific bodies) before it establishes a national program
on  ocean  acidification,  it  will  require  at  least  two  years  to  coordinate.  Each  of  the
committees and panels must be allowed some time to perform their work before they
can provide meaningful input back to NOAA, and the Committee will require addi-
tional  time  to  evaluate  the  different  input  provided  by  each  of  the  committees  and
panels before a final recommendation to Congress can be made.

The Administration recommends that H.R. 4174 be modified to place greater em-
phasis  on  changing  ocean  carbon  chemistry,  rather  than  limiting  the  scope  to  pH.
In  particular,  the  impacts  of  the  changing  levels  of  various  forms  of  dissolved  inor-
ganic  carbon  and  alkalinity  offer  more  comprehensive  information  on  how  changes
in  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  concentrations  are  impacting  our  oceans.  It  is  the
changes in the carbon system parameters that are at the heart of the ocean acidifi-
cation  issue.  In  addition  to  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide,  there  are  secondary  proc-

19

esses  (such  as  changes  in  land  use,  continental  weathering,  and  emissions  of  other
acidic  compounds)  that  will  also  influence  carbonate  chemistry  and  will  thus  need
to be considered in any research program.

Conclusion

In  conclusion,  it  has  been  recently  discovered  that  ocean  acidification,  caused  by
the  buildup  of  carbon  dioxide  and  other  acidic  compounds  in  the  atmosphere,  may
have  significant  impacts  on  marine  ecosystems.  Results  from  laboratory,  field  and
modeling  studies,  as  well  as  evidence  from  the  geological  record,  clearly  indicate
that  marine  ecosystems  are  highly  susceptible  to  the  increases  in  oceanic  CO2 and
the  corresponding  decreases  in  pH.  Because  of  the  very  clear  potential  for  ocean-
wide  impacts  of  ocean  acidification  at  all  levels  of  the  marine  ecosystem,  from  the
tiniest phytoplankton to zooplankton to fish and shellfish, we can expect to see sig-
nificant impacts that are of immense importance to mankind. Ocean acidification is
an  emerging  scientific  issue  and  much  research  is  needed  before  all  of  the  eco-
systems responses are well understood. However, to the limit that the scientific com-
munity understands this issue right now, the potential for environmental, economic
and  societal  risk  is  also  quite  high,  hence  demanding  serious  and  immediate  atten-
tion. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to address this subcommittee. I look
forward to answering your questions.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  JOAN  A.  KLEYPAS,  SCIENTIST,  INSTITUTE
FOR  THE  STUDY  OF  SOCIETY  AND  ENVIRONMENT,  NA-
TIONAL CENTER FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
Dr.  KLEYPAS.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Lampson,  also  Ranking
Member  Inglis,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  I  am  very  grateful
for being able to provide testimony about the effects of ocean acidi-
fication on marine life and to provide recommendations on the Fed-
eral Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act.

Representative Inslee may have not done so well in the Stanford
Chemistry,  but  he  got  an  A-plus  today  in  his  description  of  ocean
acidification,  and  as  he  and  Dr.  Feely  has  described,  ocean  acidifi-
cation is proceeding, and it will continue for as long as carbon diox-
ide remains unstabilized in our atmosphere.

Over  the  last  decade  we  have  gathered  a  lot  of  information  to
confidently say that ocean acidification is a major threat to marine
life, and here are some of the effects.

Ocean acidification has been shown to affect a wide variety of or-
ganisms  from  the  tiniest  microscopic  single-celled  bacteria  in  the
oceans, all the way up through coral reef ecosystems, and it is like-
ly to alter our food webs as well.

Ocean  acidification  can  affect  photosynthesis,  respiration,  repro-
duction,  and  growth,  and  as  described  already,  it  also  affects  the
ability  of  many  marine  organisms  to  secrete  their  calcium  car-
bonate  skeletons  or  shells.  These,  we  often  think  of  the  common
things  like  corals,  shellfish,  and  starfish,  but  it  also  affects  many
lesser-known microscopic organisms that are pervasive in, through-
out the oceans.

As  the  oceans  become  more  acidic,  it  simply  is  harder  for  these
organisms  to  secrete  their  calcium  carbonate  shells,  and  as  an  ex-
ample,  you  might  recall  that  experiment  when  you  were  a  kid
where  you  take  an  egg  and  you  put  it  in  household  vinegar.  After

21

a  few  days  that  calcium  carbonate  has  dissolved  away,  and  that
eggshell  is  soft,  and  it  is  no  longer  protective.  So  that  experiment
is  really  a  dramatic  example  of  what  acid  can  do  to  calcium  car-
bonate skeletons, but the principle is really the same.

So  shells  and  skeletons  are  very  important  for  the  survival  of
marine  organisms.  They  produce  those  shells  for  a  reason,  and
those  reasons  are  things  like  protection  and  for  competition  of
space. In corals, for example, we estimate that the growth rates of
their  skeletons  will  decline  by  10  to  50  percent  within  the  next  40
to  50  years.  That  means  they  will  have  to  grow  much  more  slowly
or  less  densely,  like  osteoporosis,  and  you  know,  if  our  bones  grew
10  to  50  percent  less,  that  would  be  a  pretty  big  deal.  We  would
either be much shorter or our bones would be a lot weaker.

Ocean  acidification  affects  coral  reefs  in  other  ways,  too.  Reefs
exist  because  corals  and  other  organisms  build  them  faster  than
they  are  eroded  away.  Even  if  corals  are  able  to  maintain  their
growth, ocean acidification will still cause reefs to erode away more
quickly,  and  if  they  do  erode  away,  we  are  going  to  lose  a  lot  of
those  services  that  reefs  provide  like  fisheries,  biodiversity,  and
coastline protection.

Right  now  we  really  can’t  predict  exactly  what  will  happen  to
marine ecosystems if ocean acidification continues, but another ex-
ample  would  be  like  an  aquarium,  and  a  lot  of  us  started  aquar-
iums when we were little, and we did everything just right. We got
the  salinity  right,  the  temperature,  the  organisms,  but  one  of  the
most  important  things  to  do  in  an  aquarium  is  to  get  the  pH  just
right,  to  keep  it  within  a  very  narrow  range.  If  you  don’t  do  that
and the pH declines, the first thing to go are the corals. They stop
growing,  and  then  what  happens  is  the  algae  tend  to  take  over.
And  so  what  you  have  witnessed  there  on  a  small  scale  is  the  re-
placement of that very desirable ecosystem with one which we don’t
desire.

So across the entire ocean as acidification proceeds, we expect to
see  similar  changes  in  our  ecosystems.  So  what  do  we  do  about
this?  Well,  first,  we  need  to  take  actions  to  reduce  carbon  dioxide
emissions,  but  second,  given  that  we  are  already  experiencing
ocean  acidification  and  that  we  expect  it  to  continue  in  the  next
two,  you  know,  next  few  decades,  we  need  studies  to  tell  us  what
impacts will be and how to manage ecosystems underneath this ad-
ditional stress.

So  the  Federal  Ocean  Acidification  Research  and  Monitoring
(FOARAM)  Act  is,  really  is  a  good  bill,  and  it  addresses  the  major
research  needs,  but  I  have  two  recommendations  to  strengthen  it.
One  is  a  stronger  commitment  of  funds.  The  appropriations  are
really quite modest when we consider the scope of the problem and
the  cost  of  comparable  ocean  programs  in  the  past.  In  order  to  do
this  research  quickly  and  to  provide  good  advice  to  managers  and
decision-makers,  we  have  estimated  that  the  minimum  costs  to  do
this research is about $50 to $55 million a year.

The  other  point  is  this.  Ocean  acidification  is  a  big,  emerging
issue,  and  there  is  the  potential  for  many  new  discoveries,  things
that we just don’t know about yet. So we need not only applied re-
search, but we need very basic research as well.

Through  our  previous  workshops  and  planning  efforts  we  have
already  identified  the  strengths  that  both  federal  and  academic
agencies  will  bring  to  ocean  acidification  program,  and  to  build  on
those efforts I recommend that the bill explicitly delineate the roles
of each of those relevant agencies and allocate resources directly to
them.

Thank  you  again  for  this  opportunity  to  take,  to  make  the  case
for  ocean  acidification  as  an  urgent  and  important  issue  and  to
comment on the FOARAM Act.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOAN A. KLEYPAS1

Chairman Lampson, Ranking Member Inglis, and Members of the Subcommittee:
thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony about the importance of the Fed-
eral Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring (FOARAM) Act. My name is Joan
Kleypas. I am a Scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boul-
der,  Colorado.  My  research  has  focused  on  the  interactions  between  marine  eco-
systems  and  climate  change,  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  impacts  of  climate
change  on  coral  reef  ecosystems.  I  have  worked  on  coral  reefs  for  more  than  20
years, and on ocean acidification for 10 years. I have authored or co-authored more
than  40  peer-reviewed  scientific  journal  articles,  book  chapters,  and  technical  docu-
ments,  and  have  presented  more  than  40  invited  talks  worldwide.  I  have  co-orga-
nized  several  international  workshops  on  issues  related  to  climate  change  and  ma-
rine  ecosystems.  I  currently  serve  on  three  committees  related  to  carbon  and  the
oceans:  the  Ocean  Carbon  and  Biogeochemistry  Scientific  Steering  Committee,  the
International advisory boards of the European CarboOcean Program, and the Euro-
pean  Program  on  Ocean  Acidification  (EPOCA).  You  have  asked  me  to  discuss  the
potential  scope  and  impacts  of  ocean  acidification  on  marine  organisms  and  eco-
systems,  the  need  for  federal  research,  monitoring  and  assessment  programs  to  ad-
dress  this  phenomenon,  and  for  recommendations  for  strengthening  and  improving
federal research to do so.

I. Introduction

Ocean  acidification  is  increasingly  recognized  as  an  important  and  potentially
dangerous consequence of increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide in
Earth’s atmosphere. Because climate change and ocean acidification are both caused
by  increasing  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  acidification  is  commonly  referred
to  as  the  ‘‘other  CO2 problem.’’ 2,3 But  compared  to  climate  change,  ocean  acidifica-
tion is a more direct and predictable consequence of rising atmospheric carbon diox-
ide and does not suffer from uncertainties associated with climate change forecasts.
Absorption  of  anthropogenic  carbon  dioxide,  reduced  pH,  and  lower  calcium  car-
bonate  (CaCO3)  saturation  in  surface  waters,  where  the  bulk  of  oceanic  production
occurs,  are  well-verified  from  models,  hydrographic  surveys  and  time  series
data.4,5,6,7

Since pre-industrial times, atmospheric concentration of atmospheric carbon diox-
ide has increased from 280 to 385 ppmv (a 38 percent increase). The increase in at-

mospheric  concentration  has  driven  more  CO2 into  the  surface  ocean  that,  through
a series of carbon and water chemical reactions (e.g., the formation of carbonic acid),
has  led  to  a  decrease  in  average  pH  of  the  surface  ocean  from  about  8.2  to  8.1.  If
atmospheric  CO2 concentrations  reach  800  ppmv  (the  projected  end-of-century  con-
centration  according  to  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)
business as usual emission scenario), average surface ocean pH will decrease to 7.8–
7.9. This change in pH may at first seem small, but it is significant for several im-
portant reasons:

1) Because  pH  measures  acidity  on  a  logarithmic  scale,  a  0.1  decrease  in  pH

represents a 30 percent increase in ocean acidity.

2) Surface  ocean  pH  is  already  lower  than  has  occurred  in  the  oceans  for  at

least 800,000 years, and probably many millions of years.

3) The  speed  of  this  change  is  likely  to  outstrip  the  ability  of  many  organisms

to adapt to the lower pH.

II. Potential scope and impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms

and ecosystems

A. Impacts on Marine Organisms

The fact that increases atmospheric carbon dioxide can cause changes in ocean pH
has been known for about a century, but the potential impacts on ocean biota have
only  recently  been  appreciated.  A  general  summary  of  these  effects  is  provided  in
Table 1.

Table 1 illustrates two main points. First, it is clear that changes in ocean chem-
istry cause important responses in many groups of marine organisms. Experimental
studies  on  corals,  for  example,  which  are  the  best-studied  group,  indicate  that  the
rate  at  which  they  produce  their  skeletons  will  decrease  10–50  percent  by  the  mid-
dle  of  this  century  (e.g.,  when  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  levels  reach  560  ppmv).
Depending  on  the  species  of  coral,  a  decrease  in  this  ‘‘calcification  rate’’  will  either
stunt  the  growth  of  the  colony,  or  result  in  a  weaker  skeleton  (similar  to
osteoporosis in humans).

The  second  point  is  that  relative  to  the  potential  consequences  of  ocean  acidifica-
tion, we still have very few studies on which to base our predictions about how ma-
rine  life  will  change  in  response  to  future  ocean  acidification.8 Most  studies  have
concentrated on the rather obvious effect of ocean acidification on the ability of ma-
rine organisms to grow their shells and skeletons (corals, coccolithophores, mollusks,
etc.).  Fewer  studies  have  focused  on  other  physiological  effects  such  as  photosyn-
thesis,  respiration,  and  reproduction.  Even  fewer  studies  have  looked  at  the  effects
on  other  important  marine  processes  such  as  nitrogen  fixation,  or  on  the  ability  of
ecosystems to function and provide their normal ecosystem services.

B. Impacts on Marine Ecosystems

Almost  all  ocean  acidification  studies  have  been  performed  on  organisms  rather
than ecosystems, and so far we have had to infer the ultimate effects on ecosystems.
For  example,  we  have  some  understanding  of  why  organisms  secrete  calcium  car-
bonate  shells  (e.g.,  protection,  securing  to  the  substrate),  but  we  have  only  a  few
examples of how a thinner shell or slower growth rate will affect an organism’s fit-
ness or behavior within its ecosystem.9

In some cases ocean acidification will directly affect major fishery resources, such
as  shellfish.  In  other  cases,  ocean  acidification  will  indirectly  affect  fisheries  by  al-
tering food webs. A well-cited scenario is one where increasing ocean acidity reduces
the  ranges  of  pteropods,  small  planktonic  marine  snails  that  are  an  important  food
source for some important food fish like salmon.10

In  benthic  systems,  ocean  pH  and  associated  carbonate  chemistry  affect  the  dis-
solution  rates  of  calcium  carbonate  sediments,11,12 and  appear  to  alter  the  func-
tioning  of  sediment-dwelling  organisms.13 On  coral  reefs,  even  if  biological  calcifi-

cation rates did not decline, ocean acidification will decrease reef cementation14 and
cause  dissolution  rates  to  increase,15 both  of  which  can  shift  the  reef  from  one  of
net  growth  to  net  erosion.  We  know  that  high  biodiversity  on  reefs  is  largely  due
to the reef structure and its complex of holes, substrates, etc., and loss of reef struc-
ture  leads  to  loss  of  biodiversity.  However,  the  erosion  of  coral  reefs  that  act  as
breakwaters  also  increases  the  exposure  of  adjacent  low-lying  coastal  areas  to
storms  and  other  erosive  forces.  Another  benthic  example  is  deep-sea  corals,  re-
cently discovered but widespread communities that live in deeper waters; these are
limited  by  the  aragonite  saturation  depth  in  the  oceans  and  so  are  directly  threat-
ened as the aragonite saturation depth shallows in response to ocean acidification.16
It  is  unknown  how  the  loss  of  these  communities  will  affect  the  fisheries  that  they
support,  but  it  is  certain  that  degradation  of  both  coral  reefs  and  deep  water  coral
communities will impact the fisheries that are associated with them.

Not  all  organisms  will  be  affected  by  ocean  acidification,  and  we  can  expect  both
winners  and  losers.  Two  species  of  very  abundant  picoplankton  (very  small  micro-
organism in the ocean) were cultured in elevated carbon dioxide conditions; one spe-
cies exhibited a four-times increase in photosynthesis but the other showed little re-
sponse,17 which  suggests  that  open  ocean  food-web  structures  could  substantially
change  in  the  future.  Such  basic  changes  in  our  ocean  ecosystems  are  of  particular
concern  because  of  the  repercussions  to  marine  biogeochemistry,  food  webs,  fish-
eries,  and  other  ocean  resources.  These  needs  are  the  basis  for  the  call  from  the
oceanographic  community  to  establish  a  national  coordinated  program  on  ocean
acidification.

A  small-scale  example  of  how  we  might  view  future  changes  in  our  ocean  eco-
systems is to imagine the typical sequence of events in establishing a marine aquar-
ium.  One  of  the  most  important  lessons  in  keeping  marine  aquaria  is  to  maintain
the  seawater  chemistry  within  very  precise  limits  of  pH,  nutrients,  temperature,
and alkalinity. Many hobbyists launch their aquaria with all of the necessary ingre-
dients,  including  the  sand  substrate,  clean  seawater,  water  circulation,  and  of
course,  a  collection  of  beautiful  fish  and  invertebrates.  Unfortunately,  many
hobbyists  do  not  maintain  the  seawater  chemistry  adequately,  and  nutrient  levels
increase and most notably, the acidity of the water increases. As the seawater chem-
istry  changes,  so  does  the  ecosystem,  with  undesirable  species  (winners)  displacing
the  desirable  ones  (losers)  until  the  original  ecosystem  has  been  entirely  replaced
by another. As ocean acidification progresses in our oceans, we can imagine a simi-
lar course of ecosystem changes, albeit more slowly and perhaps not as pronounced.
In  fact,  a  recent  study  of  ecosystem  shifts  around  underwater  volcanic  carbon  diox-
ide  vents  confirm  that  calcifying  organisms,  in  particular,  are  progressively  dis-
placed by algae and other non-calcifying organisms along the gradient of decreasing
pH.18

C. Other Impacts

The  effects  of  ocean  acidification  reach  beyond  the  impacts  on  organisms.  pH  is
a  fundamental  property  of  seawater  that  governs  innumerable  chemical  reactions
and  equilibria.  Acidity  and  oxidation  state  are  the  two  phenomena  that  modulate
all of ocean chemistry and biochemistry. The speciation (the chemical form) of many
elements and nutrients in seawater changes in response to pH. These include many
common elements (e.g., iron, copper, zinc) and nutrients such as phosphate, silicate
and  ammonia,  all  of  which  are  essential  to  biological  processes.  Very  few  studies
have  looked  into  the  biogeochemical  consequences  of  changing  pH  on  nutrients,  al-
though changes in the speciation of phosphate, silicate, iron and ammonium will be

tury.19 For example, in regions with high nutrient concentrations, a decrease in pH
from  8.1  to  7.8  causes  the  proportion  of  ammonium  (NH4
∂ )  to  ammonia  (NH3)  to
increase,20 and can potentially affect important metabolic processes like nitrification
(the  conversion  of  ammonium  and  ammonia  to  nitrate,  the  form  of  nitrogen  that  is
used in photosynthesis).

Ultimately,  ocean  acidification  will  affect  the  global  ocean  carbon  cycle.  Future
changes in calcium carbonate production and dissolution alone will almost certainly
have  impacts  on  the  ocean’s  capacity  to  store  carbon.  If  ocean  acidification  causes
shifts  in  ecosystems,  particularly  in  microbial  communities,  then  we  can  expect  ad-
ditional  changes  in  marine  biogeochemistry.  The  interplay  and  feedbacks  between
marine  biogeochemistry,  ecosystem  shifts,  and  feedbacks  to  the  Earth  system  are
complex,  and  our  ability  to  predict  how  these  processes  will  be  impacted  by  ocean
acidification, particularly in combination with other global climate changes, is a for-
midable task.

III. The  need  for  federal  research,  monitoring,  and  assessment  programs

on ocean acidification

In  2006,  a  report  jointly  sponsored  by  the  National  Science  Foundation,  the  Na-
tional  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration,  and  U.S.  Geological  Survey21 enti-
tled  ‘‘Impacts  of  Ocean  Acidification  on  Coral  Reefs  and  Other  Marine  Calcifiers:  A
Guide  for  Future  Research.’’  This  report  was  borne  out  of  a  workshop  held  in  St.
Petersburg,  Florida,  and  represents  the  consensus  of  more  than  60  experts  in  the
fields  of  marine  chemistry,  physics,  biology,  geology  and  remote  sensing.  Following
this  report,  the  scientific  steering  committee  of  the  Ocean  Carbon  and  Biogeo-
chemistry Program (OCB; a NSF–NOAA–NASA interagency group with the mission
to:  establish  the  evolving  role  of  the  ocean  in  the  global  carbon  cycle,  in  the  face  of
environmental  change,  through  studies  of  marine  biogeochemical  cycles  and  associ-
ated  ecosystems),  identified  ocean  acidification  as  one  of  its  top  research  priorities,
and  sponsored  a  workshop  to  further  recommend  research  strategies  to  investigate
the effects of ocean acidification on not only calcification, but other marine biological
and biogeochemical processes as well. That workshop convened at the Scripps Insti-
tute of Oceanography in October 2007, and with the input of more than 90 scientists
in the field, produced priorities and timelines for ocean acidification research in four
major  ocean  environments:  warm-water  coral  reefs,  coastal  margins,  subtropical/
tropical pelagic regions, and high latitude regions.22

The  remaining  testimony  draws  heavily  from  these  two  workshops  and  reports,
because  they  represent  several  years  of  work  to  synthesize  existing  knowledge  on
how  ocean  acidification  affects  marine  ecosystems,  as  well  as  a  consensus  of  the
many scientists who produced that research and attended the workshops.

A. Priorities in Ocean Acidification Research—A Scientific Consensus

The  St.  Petersburg  Report23 identified  the  state  of  the  current  scientific  knowl-
edge  (Chapters  1–3);  the  urgent  gaps  in  that  knowledge  (Chapter  3)  and  how  to
tackle them (Chapters 3–6); and recommended an overall phased scientific strategy
for the next 5–10 years (Chapter 7). The major scientific needs identified in this re-
port were to:

1. Determine the calcification response of benthic calcifiers such as corals (in-
cluding  cold-water  corals),  coralline  algae,  foraminifera,  mollusks,  and
echinoderms to elevated carbon dioxide; and in planktonic calcifiers such as
coccolithophores, foraminifera, and shelled pteropods;

2. Discriminate  the  various  mechanisms  of  calcification  within  calcifying
groups,  through  physiological  experiments,  to  better  understand  the  cross-
taxa range of responses to changing seawater chemistry;

3. Determine  the  interactive  effects  of  multiple  variables  that  affect  calcifi-
cation  and  dissolution  in  organisms  (saturation  state,  light,  temperature,
nutrients)  through  continued  experimental  studies  on  an  suite  of  calcifying
groups;

4. Establish clear links between laboratory experiments and the natural envi-

ronment, by combining laboratory experiments with field studies;

5. Characterize  the  diurnal  and  seasonal  cycles  of  the  carbonate  system  on
coral reefs, including commitment to long-term monitoring of the system re-
sponse to increases in carbon dioxide;

6. In  concert  with  above,  monitor  in  situ  calcification  and  dissolution  in
planktonic  and  benthic  organisms,  with  better  characterization  of  the  key
environmental controls on calcification;

7. Incorporate  ecological  questions  into  observations  and  experiments;  e.g.,
How  does  a  change  in  calcification  rate  affect  the  ecology  and  survivorship
of  an  organism?  How  will  ecosystem  functions  differ  between  communities
with and without calcifying species?

8. Improve  the  accounting  of  coral  reef  and  open  ocean  carbonate  budgets
through  combined  measurements  of  seawater  chemistry;  calcium  carbonate
production,  dissolution  and  accumulation,  and  bioerosion  and  off-shelf  ex-
port;

9. Quantify  and  parameterize  the  mechanisms  that  contribute  to  the  car-
bonate  system,  through  biogeochemical  and  ecological  modeling,  and  apply
such modeling to guide future sampling and experimental efforts;

10. Develop protocols for the various methodologies used in seawater chemistry

and calcification measurements.

The  recommendations  from  the  Scripps  workshop  expanded  on  the  major  points
listed above, but also included non-calcifying organisms and ecosystems, and focused
on  four  major  environments:  warm-water  coral  reefs,  coastal  margins,  subtropical/
tropical  pelagic  regions,  and  high-latitude  regions.  In  addition  to  establishing  re-
search  plans  in  each  of  these  environments,  overall  recommendations  from  this
workshop were to:

1. Quantify the distributions and abundances of calcareous organisms, particu-
larly in regions projected to undergo substantial changes in carbonate chem-
istry over the next decades;

2. Develop  autonomous  systems  for  measurement  of  the  seawater  CO2 system

(pH, pCO2, total dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity);

3. Establish a U.S. national program on ocean acidification that will coordinate
research  activities  among  federal  agencies,  and  leverage  existing  infrastruc-
ture  and  programs,  as  well  as  establish  sites  for  monitoring  and  process
studies aimed explicitly at ocean acidification; and

4. Develop  a  coordinated,  global  network  of  ocean  observations  and  studies

through close partnerships with our international colleagues.

B. The Need for a Federal Program on Ocean Acidification

Ocean acidification is an emerging scientific issue; the issue is of high uncertainty
but  also  high  risk.  Evidence  from  multiple  scientific  disciplines  indicate  that  ocean
acidification  will  cause  changes  in  marine  organisms,  ecosystems  and  biogeo-
chemistry,  as  well  in  the  overall  functioning  of  the  ocean  and  global  carbon  cycles.
However,  our  ability  to  forecast  these  changes  is  severely  limited  by  a  lack  of  data
and scientific understanding of oceanic and ecosystem processes. Given that so much
of the U.S. economy draws from ocean and coastal resources (e.g., the value of U.S.
commercial  fisheries  is  more  than  $35  billion  per  year24 ),  the  establishment  of  a
federal  program  to  research  the  potential  impacts  of  ocean  acidification  is  a  sound
economic investment.

The  need  for  this  understanding  has  prompted  scientists  both  nationally  and
internationally  to  accelerate  ocean  acidification  research.  Many  U.S.-based  and
international  workshops  on  ocean  acidification  have  highlighted  the  need  to  coordi-

tistics Division, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

nate  this  research  at  both  the  national  and  international  levels.  The  coordination
is  necessary  to  avoid  duplication  of  efforts,  and  have  the  international  community
join  forces  in  ways  that  are  both  necessary  to  answer  the  most  pressing  scientific
and management questions, and to improve the efficiency of translating research re-
sults  to  support  decision-makers.  Some  of  the  U.S.’s  international  colleagues  have
already established their own government-funded programs (e.g., European Program
on Ocean Acidification) or are in the process of doing so (Australian Institute of Ma-
rine Science).

One  of  the  reasons  for  an  integrated  and  coordinated  federal  program  supporting
ocean  acidification  research  is  that  no  single  federal  agency  can  adequately  tackle
the  breadth  of  the  research  needed  to  understand  ocean  acidification,  its  impacts,
and  its  feedbacks  on  the  Earth.  Four  federal  agencies  have  so  far  been  actively  en-
gaged  in  planning  discussions  for  ocean  acidification  research:  NOAA,  NSF,  NASA,
and USGS. Each agency brings different and valuable expertise to address the prob-
lems and questions on ocean acidification, and is an essential component of a feder-
ally  funded  research  program.  NOAA  primarily  brings  expertise  in  terms  of  ocean
observing  systems  and  physiological  responses  of  commercially  important  fish  and
shellfish species. NSF supports academic, hypothesis-driven research in ocean chem-
istry,  the  physiology  of  ocean  organisms  and  understanding  of  ecological  systems,
fostered around the world in field settings or in the laboratories of American institu-
tions. NASA provides the capacity to remotely sense the effects of ocean acidification
on ocean biology and chemistry, and/or scale up from in-water measurements to re-
gional  and  global  scales  to  address  appropriate  research  questions.  The  USGS  has
the history and expertise in examining the interactions between coastal marine eco-
systems and seawater carbonate chemistry. Together these agency areas of expertise
fit  together  to  form  the  foundation  of  an  integrated  and  coordinated  research  pro-
gram to understand a changing ocean system.

H.R.  4174  (FOARAM  Act)  addresses  the  above  recommendations  to  establish  as
U.S.  research  program  on  ocean  acidification  that  includes  monitoring;  laboratory
and field investigations of ocean acidification impacts on organism, ecosystems, and
biogeochemistry;  studies  on  the  interactions  with  other  environmental  changes  in
the ocean; environmental and ecosystem modeling; and studies on the socioeconomic
impacts.  I  have  encouraged  the  passing  of  H.R.  4174  in  recent  testimony  to  the
House  Select  Committee  on  Energy  and  the  Environment.25 I  continue  to  support
the passage of this bill, with several recommended changes.

IV. Recommendations for strengthening and improving federal research on

ocean acidification

A. Coordination among federal agencies and with international partners

The  Ocean  Research  Priorities  Plan  (ORPP)  and  Implementation  Strategy26 lists
20  national  ocean  research  priorities  for  the  coming  decade,  and  ocean  acidification
is  an  issue  that  cuts  across  many  of  these  priorities.  The  ORPP  Implementation
Strategy established a strong basis for carrying out these priorities by including: 1)
use  of  existing  mechanisms  to  address  ocean  research  priorities,  2)  partnerships
(local,  tribal,  State,  federal,  international,  etc.),  3)  peer-review,  4)  balancing  sus-
tained  effort  with  new  initiatives,  and  5)  accounting  for  different  scales  of  research
efforts and needs. A new governance structure established under the Committee on
Ocean  Policy  expands  the  capacity  for  coordinating  efforts  across  various  federal
agencies.

H.R.  4174  currently  authorizes  the  allocation  of  funds  to  one  agency  (NOAA),
which  must  then  allocate  to  other  departments  and  agencies.  A  more  prudent  ap-
proach  is  to  directly  allocate  federal  funds  to  each  agency  partner,  and  to  take  ad-
vantage of existing cross-agency groups to coordinate and manage activities between
agencies.  Given  that  ocean  acidification  was  recognized  as  an  important  issue  only
within  the  last  several  years,  there  is  still  considerable  basic  research  to  be  done
on the impacts of changing chemistry on the oceans and its ecosystems. Ocean acidi-
fication is proving to be a far-reaching issue, and one that will almost certainly yield
new  discoveries,  which  calls  for  supporting  unsolicited  research  proposals  on  ocean
acidification  that  are  unconstrained  by  questions  predefined  by  federal  agencies.
This is the very heart of basic research and of discovery of the unknown dimensions

of  ocean  acidification.  I  therefore  recommend  that  H.R.  4174  more  explicitly  delin-
eate the roles of the relevant agencies and allocate resources accordingly.

However,  there  is  a  need  for  interagency  coordination.  To  ensure  that  basic  as
well  as  applied  research  is  carried  out  in  a  prompt  and  timely  way,  there  must  be
a funding mechanism that entrains the academic research community in a competi-
tive, peer-reviewed program of extramural funding (the National Ocean Partnership
Program27 (NOPP) Broad Agency Announcement provides an example of how to de-
sign such a mechanism). Establishing an interagency funding mechanism builds on
the interagency cooperation on science funding and workshop support that led to the
recognition  that  ocean  acidification  is  an  urgent  issue  and  merits  further  research.
The same interagency cooperation led to the establishment of the Ocean Carbon and
Biogeochemistry (OCB) office to facilitate sustained science planning on ocean acidi-
fication and other pressing ocean research priorities. To sustain significant progress
on  the  basic  and  applied  research  outlined  above  I  recommend  that  this  legislation
establish  a  consultative  interagency  body  focused  on  the  science  of  ocean  acidifica-
tion.

For  scientific  oversight,  a  scientific  steering  committee  that  includes  scientists
funded from each of the participating agencies would oversee the scientific decisions,
similar  to  how  the  scientific  steering  committee  oversaw  the  U.S.  Joint  Global
Ocean Flux Study (U.S. JGOFS) Program. (OCB) Scientific Steering Committee, for
example,  which  is  jointly  supported  by  NSF,  NOAA,  and  NASA,  is  already  well  in-
formed  and  supportive  of  ocean  acidification  research,  and  could  naturally  take  on
the scientific guidance of an ocean acidification research program.

Finally,  the  objectives  to  understand  the  effects  of  ocean  acidification  are  uni-
versal  with  our  international  colleagues,  and  much  good  will  has  been  forged  be-
tween  scientists  in  the  last  few  years  toward  maintaining  international  partner-
ships.  The  EPOCA  program,  for  example,  includes  several  U.S.  scientists  on  its  ex-
ternal advisory board. The global nature of ocean acidification certainly calls for in-
creasing mechanisms to increase coordination of research with our international col-
leagues.

B. Costs

The  authorization  of  appropriations  in  H.R.  4174  for  fiscal  years  2009,  2010,  and
2011,  is  $6  million,  $8  million,  and  $11  million,  respectively,  and  $30  million  per
year  for  each  year  thereafter.  It  is  useful  to  compare  this  appropriation  to  that  of
similarly  tasked  interagency  ocean  research  programs  in  the  late  1990s.  For  exam-
ple,  the  NSF  (only)  contributions  to  JGOFS  and  GLOBEC28 totaled  about  $17–$22
million  per  year.  The  broad  nature  of  an  ocean  acidification  program  will  require
both  a  biogeochemical  emphasis  (similar  to  U.S.  JGOFS)  as  well  as  the  effects  on
high-order organisms and ecosystems (similar to U.S. GLOBEC). The additional con-
tributions  from  NOAA,  NASA,  and  DOE  to  these  programs  are  estimated  to  have
doubled  the  total  funding  to  around  $40–$45  million  per  year.  The  FOARAM  Act
appropriations  are  therefore  quite  modest  compared  to  similarly  sized  programs  of
10  years  ago.  In  order  to  obtain  timely  information  relevant  to  managers  and  deci-
sion-makers,  we  realistically  need  $50–$55  million  per  year.  The  $30  million  per
year  may  be  appropriate  for  the  first  two  to  three  years,  while  large-scale  efforts
are  still  being  planned,  but  once  the  program  is  fully  engaged,  $50–$55  million  is
considered  the  minimum  if  scientists  are  to  provide  useful  information  regarding
how the oceans are responding to acidification, and how we should change our miti-
gation and adaptation policies.

Summary

Ocean  acidification  is  an  emerging  scientific  issue,  and  one  of  high  uncertainty
but high risk. Evidence from multiple scientific disciplines indicate that ocean acidi-
fication  will  cause  changes  in  marine  organisms,  ecosystems  and  biogeochemistry,
as well as in the overall functioning of the ocean and global carbon cycles. However,
our  ability  to  forecast  these  changes  is  severely  limited  by  a  lack  of  data  and  sci-
entific  understanding  of  oceanic  and  ecosystem  processes.  Two  important  U.S.-led
workshops  on  ocean  acidification  have  already  identified  the  major  gaps  in  our  un-
derstanding  of  the  consequences  of  ocean  acidification  for  marine  life,  and  have  set
priorities to guide a national research program on this topic.

H.R. 4174 (the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act) enables
such a national research program through the establishment of an interagency com-
mittee  to  oversee  the  planning,  establishment,  and  coordination  of  ocean  acidifica-

tion research; the establishment of reporting procedures; the development of a stra-
tegic  research  and  implementation  plan;  and  an  authorization  of  appropriations  to
carry out the plan.

I  have  recommended  a  few  important  changes  to  H.R.  4174,  but  otherwise  fully
support  this  bill  that  is  so  urgently  needed  to  ensure  proper  stewardship  of  our
oceans and protection of the abundant natural resources they provide.

Chairman Lampsom, Ranking Member Inglis, and Members of the Subcommittee:
thank  you  once  again  for  the  opportunity  to  provide  this  testimony  about  ocean
acidification,  and  to  provide  recommendations  toward  accelerating  the  scientific
process  of  understanding  its  impacts  quickly  and  in  ways  that  will  help  inform  fu-
ture policy and management decisions.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  SCOTT  C.  DONEY,  SENIOR  SCIENTIST,  DE-
PARTMENT  OF  MARINE  CHEMISTRY  AND  GEOCHEMISTRY,
WOODS HOLE OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTION
Dr.  DONEY.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member
Inglis,  and  Subcommittee  Members.  Thank  you  for  giving  me  the
opportunity today to talk about the Federal Ocean Acidification Re-
search and Monitoring Act.

The rapid rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels due to defor-
estation  and  fossil  fuel  burning  is  fundamentally  changing  the
chemistry  of  the  sea,  pushing  surface  waters  towards  more  acidic
conditions.  The  physics  and  chemistry  of  this  process  are  well  un-
derstood, and ocean acidification is now confirmed by real-world ob-
servations.

Unless carbon dioxide emissions are curbed, acidification will ac-
celerate  over  the  next  several  decades.  Laboratory  experiments
show that acidification directly harms many marine plants and ani-
mals  by  reducing  calcium  carbonate  shell  and  skeleton  formation,
slowing growth rates, and hindering reproduction.

Acidification thus directly threatens a wide range of marine orga-
nisms,  from  microscopic  plankton  and  shellfish  to  massive  coral
reefs. Acidification will affect the food webs that depend upon those
shell-forming  organisms  for  both  food  and  habitat,  as  well  as  the
oceanic economic and ecosystem functions that we depend upon.

About  half  the  dollar  value  of  U.S.  fishery  landings  comes  from
species  that  are  directly  sensitive  to  ocean  acidification.  The
present national investment in ocean acidification research is inad-
equate  to  address  these  challenges.  As  a  result,  the  U.S.  research
community is not providing the information needed by stakeholders
and  policy-makers  and  is  falling  behind  our  European  and  Japa-
nese colleagues.

Major gaps exist in our current scientific understanding, limiting
our  ability  to  forecast  the  consequences  of  ocean  acidification  and
hindering the development of adaptation approaches for marine re-
source managers.

Rising  carbon  dioxide  will  affect  many  ocean  processes  beyond
just  shell  formation.  And  recent  results  suggest  that  there  may  be
biological winners as well as losers as some organisms benefit from
elevated  carbon  dioxide  levels.  Expanded  ocean  and  satellite-based
observations  are  needed  to  monitor  ocean  acidification  and  its  bio-
logical  impacts,  particularly  in  our  coastal  waters,  where  acidifica-
tion  is  already  occurring  as  Dr.  Feely  has  mentioned,  in  very  im-
portant ecosystems.

Innovative  ecosystem  scale  field  experiments  are  required  to
characterize  ocean  acidification  and  the  changes  they  have,  it  has
on  marine  food  webs.  The  science  must  also  be  better  connected
with  stakeholder  needs  with  more  applied  research  targeting  re-

source  management,  conservation,  and  the  socioeconomic  impacts
from damaged fisheries and coral reefs.

The FOARAM Act is an important step towards a comprehensive
U.S. ocean research program on acidification. The proposed funding
level ramping up to $30 million in fiscal year 2012 will greatly en-
hance U.S. research capabilities, but as mentioned by Dr. Kleypas,
even this level may fall short of the true needs, which we have esti-
mated at closer to $50 to $55 million a year.

There is much that we don’t know about acidification, and the re-
search program should leave wide latitude for exploratory and dis-
covery-based science investigations, such as those supported by the
National  Science  Foundation  and  NASA.  The  bill  should  also  in-
clude  a  substantial  portion  of  funding  that  is  not  just  competitive
but also extramural to harness the tremendous capacity of our aca-
demic  research  community.  Considering  the  scope  of  the  ocean
acidification  problem,  we  need  to  bring  all  available  resources  to
bear on developing the science quickly and efficiently.

Direct authorizations of funds to NASA and NSF rather than di-
recting it through NOAA would streamline the distribution and the
planning  effort  and  take  better  advantage  of  the  new  capabilities
of  our  main  ocean  agencies  on  science,  NASA  and  remote  sensing,
NSF on process studies and chemical and biological dynamics, and
NOAA on ocean monitoring and fisheries.

The bill should support a strong interagency consultative process
on  the  science  of  ocean  acidification,  but  this  may  be  best  accom-
plished through successful existing and often informal partnerships
among  the  agencies  rather  than  creating  a  new  interagency  com-
mittee specifically directed on ocean acidification.

Thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  address  the  Sub-

committee, and I look forward to answering your questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SCOTT C. DONEY1

Introduction

Good  morning  Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member  Inglis  and  Members  of  the
Subcommittee.  Thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  you  today
on  ocean  acidification  and  the  proposed  Federal  Ocean  Acidification  Research  and
Monitoring  Act,  H.R.  4174.  My  name  is  Scott  Doney,  and  I  am  a  Senior  Scientist
at  the  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution  in  Woods  Hole  MA.  My  research  fo-
cuses on interactions among climate, the ocean and global carbon cycles, and marine
ecosystems. I have published more than 110 peer-reviewed scientific journal articles
and  book  chapters  on  these  and  related  subjects.  I  serve  on  the  U.S.  Carbon  Cycle
Science Program (CCSP) Scientific Steering Group and the U.S. Community Climate
System  Model  (CCSM)  Scientific  Steering  Committee.  Currently  I  am  the  Chair  of
the  U.S.  Ocean  Carbon  and  Climate  Change  (OCCC)  Scientific  Steering  Group  and
the  U.S.  Ocean  Carbon  and  Biogeochemistry  (OCB)  Scientific  Steering  Committee.
For  today’s  hearing,  you  have  asked  me  to  discuss  the  strengths  and  weaknesses
of  the  current  interagency  effort  to  monitor  and  research  ocean  acidification  and  to
assess its potential impacts on marine organisms and marine ecosystems, and in ad-
dition,  to  provide  recommendations  for  strengthening  individual  programs  of  the
federal  agencies  participating  in  the  interagency  committees  focusing  on  ocean
issues.

Current Scientific Understanding

My  comments  on  our  state  of  knowledge  about  ocean  acidification  are  based  on
a  broad  scientific  consensus  as  represented  in  the  current  scientific  literature  and

recent  in  scientific  assessments  compiled  by  the  scientific  community,  in  particular
the  United  Kingdom  Royal  Society  (Royal  Society,  2005),  the  German  Advisory
Council on Global Change (WBGU) (Schuster et al., 2006), and a U.S. science work-
shop  sponsored  by  the  National  Science  Foundation,  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric  Administration  and  the  United  States  Geological  Survey  (Kleypas  et  al.,
2006).

The  current  rapid  rise  in  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  levels,  due  to  our  intensive
burning  of  fossil  fuels  for  energy,  is  fundamentally  changing  the  chemistry  of  the
sea, pushing surface waters toward more acidic conditions. Greater acidity slows the
growth  or  even  dissolves  ocean  plant  and  animal  shells  built  from  calcium  car-
bonate,  the  same  mineral  as  in  chalk  and  limestone.  Acidification  thus  threatens  a
wide-range of marine organisms, from microscopic plankton and shellfish to massive
coral  reefs,  as  well  as  the  food  webs  that  depend  upon  these  shell-forming  species.
Rising  CO2 levels  will  also  alter  a  host  of  other  marine  biological  and  geochemical
processes,  often  in  ways  we  do  not  yet  understand.  Ocean  acidification  is  a  critical
issue  for  the  21st  century  impacting  on  the  health  of  the  ocean,  the  productivity  of
fisheries,  and  the  conservation  and  preservation  of  unique  marine  environments
such as coral reefs.

Over the last 250 years, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) increased by nearly 40
percent,  from  pre-industrial  levels  of  about  280  ppmv  (parts  per  million  volume)  to
nearly  384  ppmv  in  2007  (Solomon  et  al.,  2007).  This  rate  of  increase,  driven  by
human  fossil  fuel  combustion  and  deforestation,  is  at  least  an  order  of  magnitude
faster than has occurred for millions of years, and the current concentration is high-
er  than  experienced  on  Earth  for  at  least  the  last  800,000  years  and  likely  the  last
several tens of millions of years (Doney and Schimel, 2007). About one-third of this
excess, anthropogenic carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean, where it forms carbonic
acid  and  a  series  of  dissociation  products.  The  release  of  hydrogen  ions  from  the
breakdown  of  carbonic  acid  lowers  the  pH  of  seawater,  shifting  the  normally  some-
what alkaline seawater (surface pH about 8.2) toward more acidic conditions. As im-
portant  for  many  organisms  is  the  simultaneous  reduction  in  carbonate  ion  con-
centration,  which  is  used  in  the  construction  of  calcium  carbonate  (CaCO3)  shells.
Ocean acidification is a predictable consequence of rising atmospheric CO2 and does
not  suffer  from  uncertainties  associated  with  climate  change  forecasts.  Absorption
of  anthropogenic  CO2,  reduced  pH,  and  lower  calcium  carbonate  saturation  in  sur-
face waters, where the bulk of oceanic production occurs, are well-verified from mod-
els, hydrographic surveys and time series data (Feely et al., 2004; Orr et al., 2005).
Since preindustrial times, the average ocean surface water pH has fallen by about
0.1 units, from about 8.21 to 8.10 (Royal Society, 2005), and is expected to decrease
a  further  0.3–0.4  pH  units  (Orr  et  al.,  2005)  if  atmospheric  CO2 concentrations
reach  800  ppmv  (the  projected  end-of-century  concentration  according  to  the  Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) business as usual emission scenario;
Solomon et al., 2007). The most sensitive areas may be the sub-polar North Pacific,
the  Southern  Ocean,  and  along  the  Pacific  continental  shelf  and  margin  where  wa-
ters  are  already  near  or  at  corrosive  levels  for  some  carbonate  shells  (Feely  et  al.,
2008).  The  problem  of  ocean  acidification  will  be  with  us  for  a  long  time  because
it takes centuries to thousands of years for natural processes, primarily mixing into
the deep-sea and increased dissolution of marine carbonate sediments, to remove ex-
cess carbon dioxide from the air.

Ocean  acidification  appears  to  have  a  significant,  and  often  negative  impact  on
many ocean plant and animal species. The magnitude and even the sign of the bio-
logical effects, however, differ from organism group to group and on the specific bio-
logical processes involved. Rising atmospheric CO2 alters seawater chemistry in sev-
eral  different  ways—reducing  pH,  increasing  the  partial  pressure  of  dissolved  CO2
gas  (pCO2),  increasing  total  dissolved  inorganic  carbon,  and  reducing  carbonate  ion
and the saturation state of calcium carbonate minerals. Because of the reduction in
calcium  carbonate  saturation  state,  much  of  the  research  emphasis  has  been  on
shell-forming plants and animals that use calcium carbonate including some plank-
ton  (coccolithophorids,  foramaniferia,  and  pteropods),  benthic  mollusks  (clams,  oys-
ters and mussels), echinoderms (sea urchins), corals and coralline algae. Laboratory
experiments show that ocean acidification and changes in ocean carbonate chemistry
directly harms many of these calcifying species by reducing shell formation, slowing
growth  rates  and  hindering  reproduction  (Fabry  et  al.,  2008a).  The  degree  of  sensi-
tivity varies among species, however, and some organisms may show enhanced calci-
fication  at  CO2 levels  projected  to  occur  over  the  21st  century  (Iglesias-Rodrı´guez
et al., 2008). However, calcification-CO2 response studies exist for a limited number
of species in many calcifying groups, and currently, we lack sufficient understanding
of  calcification  mechanisms  to  explain  species-specific  differences  observed  in  ma-
nipulative experiments.

The  consequences  of  acidification  will  extend  well  beyond  the  fate  of  any  par-
ticular marine species. Acidification impacts on processes fundamental to the overall
structure and function of marine ecosystems. Any significant changes could have far
reaching  impacts  for  the  future  of  ocean  food-webs.  Many  marine  animals  prey  on
calcifying  organisms  or  utilize  their  skeletons  for  habitat.  Tropical  corals  are  the
backdrop  for  rich  and  diverse  reef  environments,  and  many  fish  species  would  dis-
appear  along  with  the  corals.  Others  such  as  clams,  scallops,  oysters  and  sea  ur-
chins  are  important  sources  of  seafood.  Less  familiar  are  the  many  shell-forming
planktonic  organisms,  including  plants  like  coccolithophores  and  marine  snails
called pteropods, which are an important food source for salmon and whales. Recent
discoveries indicate the presence of extensive deep-water coral reefs around the edge
of continents and on seamounts, which may decline before we fully understand their
contribution as a habitat for fish. Some preliminary experiments suggest that larval
and juvenile fish may also be at risk.

Human and Economic Dimensions of Ocean Acidification

Ocean acidification will also impacts the millions of people that depend on its food
and  other  resources  for  their  livelihoods.  Fish  and  marine  organisms  provided,  on
average,  15.5  percent  of  the  world’s  protein  in  2003  (FAO,  2007);  losses  of  crusta-
ceans, bivalves, their predators, and their habitat (in the case of reef-associated fish
communities)  would  particularly  injure  societies  that  depend  heavily  on  consump-
tion,  export,  and  tourism  of  marine  resources.  Reef  losses  would  also  expose  low-
lying settlements and biologically diverse regions to storm and wave damage, multi-
plying economic hardships (Anderson et al., 2006).

U.S.  commercial  fisheries  depend  on  calcifying  species  and  their  predators,  mak-
ing  economic  effects  from  ocean  acidification  a  likelihood  over  the  next  several  dec-
ades.  Acidification  effects  likely  will  be  most  directly  felt  on  mollusk  fisheries  (e.g.,
clams,  scallops,  oysters  and  mussels),  which  provide  18  percent  of  total  revenue
(Figure  1,  red  tones).  Crustaceans  (e.g.,  lobsters,  crabs,  shrimp)  may  also  be  sen-
sitive and contribute an additional 32 percent of total revenue. The possible indirect
impacts  through  reduced  food  supply  for  commercial  fish  species  is  not  well  under-
stood yet. For scale, in 2006 the total landing value (what is paid for a boat’s catch
at  the  dock)  of  the  U.S.  commercial  fisheries  was  about  $4  billion,  and  subsequent
seafood  processing,  wholesale  and  retail  activities  added  a  net  $35.1  billion  to  the
gross national product (Andrews et al., 2007). Domestic commercial marine fisheries
directly  support  a  larger  number  of  jobs  in  the  fishing  fleet,  the  exact  number  not
well reported because many fishers are self-employed; wholesaling and seafood proc-
essing  generates  an  additional  nearly  70,000  jobs  nationwide;  including  seafood  re-
tailing  and  food  services  expands  that  number  substantially.  Meanwhile,  U.S.  rec-
reational  saltwater  fishing  generated  $12  billion  of  direct,  indirect,  and  induced  in-
come (Steinback et al., 2004) and supported 350,000 jobs in 2004, many of them re-
lated to recreational boat sales and maintenance.

Scientific Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions

The  U.S.  research  community  has  recently  hosted  two  major  scientific  meetings
to identify knowledge gaps and discuss future research needs in ocean acidification.
The  first  meeting  of  60  experts  in  the  field  was  held  in  2005  in  St.  Petersburg,  FL
and sponsored by National Science Foundation (NSF), National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration (NOAA) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS); the
workshop  developed  a  consensus  set  of  recommendations  related  to  ocean  acidifica-
tion  and  calcifying  organisms  (Kleypas  et  al.,  2006).  Building  on  that  report,  the
U.S.  Ocean  Carbon  and  Biogeochemistry  (OCB)  Program  (http://us-ocb.org/),  sup-
ported  NSF,  NASA,  and  NOAA,  hosted  a  planning  workshop  for  90  U.S.  and  inter-
national  ocean  scientists  in  La  Jolla,  CA  in  the  Fall  of  2007.  The  recommendations
from the OCB workshop were similar to those of the St. Petersburg meeting but ex-
tended  as  well  more  broadly  to  acidification  impacts  on  non-calcifying  organisms
and ocean biogeochemistry (Fabry et al., 2008b).

Major  gaps  exist  in  our  current  scientific  understanding,  limiting  our  ability  to
forecast  the  consequences  of  ocean  acidification  and  hindering  the  development  of
adaptation approaches for marine resource managers. Thus far, most of the elevated
CO2 response  studies  on  marine  biota,  whether  for  calcification,  photosynthesis  or
some other physiological measure, have been short-term laboratory or mesocosm ex-
periments  ranging  in  length  from  hours  to  weeks.  Chronic  exposure  to  increased
CO2 may have complex effects on the growth and reproductive success of calcareous
and  non-calcareous  plants  and  animals  and  could  induce  possible  adaptations  that
are  not  observed  in  short-term  experiments.  Our  present  understanding  also  stems
largely  from  experiments  on  individual  organisms  or  a  species  in  isolation;  con-

sequently,  the  response  of  populations  and  communities  to  more  realistic  gradual
changes is largely unknown.

Other aspects of ocean biogeochemistry may be strongly influenced by rising CO2
levels.  Recent  experiments  with  one  of  the  most  abundant  types  of  phytoplankton,
Synechococcus,  showed  significantly  elevated  photosynthesis  rates  under  warmer,
high CO2 conditions. Elevated CO2 also enhanced nitrogen fixation rates (production
of biologically useful nutrients from dissolved nitrogen gas) for a key tropical marine
cyanobacteria,  which  would  in  effect  fertilize  the  surface  ocean  and  offset  predicted
reductions  in  tropical  biological  production  due  to  climate  warming  and  stratifica-
tion. Further, a major but under-appreciated consequence of ocean acidification will
be  broad  alterations  of  inorganic  and  organic  seawater  chemistry  beyond  the  car-
bonate system. Acidification will affect the biogeochemical dynamics of calcium car-
bonate,  organic  carbon,  nitrogen,  and  phosphorus  in  the  ocean  as  well  as  the  sea-
water chemical speciation of trace metals, trace elements and dissolved organic mat-
ter.

A  fully-integrated  research  program  with  in-water  and  remote  sensing  observing
systems  on  multiple-scales,  laboratory,  mesocosm  (large  volumes  of  seawater  either
in  tanks  or  plastic  bags),  and  field  process  studies,  and  modeling  approaches  is  re-
quired to provide policy-makers with informed management strategies that address
how humans might best mitigate or adapt to these long-term changes. This program
should  emphasize  how  changes  in  the  metabolic  processes  at  the  cellular  level  will
be  manifested  within  the  ecosystem  or  community  structure,  and  how  they  will  in-
fluence  future  climate  feedbacks.  A  program  should  include  the  following  compo-
nents:

realistically simulate natural conditions;

perturbation and calcification experiments;

• Systematic  monitoring  system  with  high  resolution  measurements  in  time
and  space  of  atmospheric  and  surface  water  carbon  dioxide  partial  pressure
(pCO2), total dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, and pH to validate model
predictions and provide the foundations for interpreting the impacts of acidifi-
cation on ecosystems;
• In  regions  projected  to  undergo  substantial  changes  in  carbonate  chemistry,
tracking of abundances and depth distributions of key calcifying and non-cal-
cifying species at appropriate temporal and spatial scales to be able to detect
possible shifts and distinguish between natural variability and anthropogenic
forced changes;
• Standardized  protocols  and  data  reporting  guidelines  for  carbonate  system
• Manipulative  laboratory  experiments  to  quantify  physiological  responses  in-
cluding  calcification  and  dissolution,  photosynthesis,  respiration,  and  other

nomically important species;

• Manipulative  mesocosm  and  field  experiments  to  investigate  community  and

Current National Research Effort on Ocean Acidification

Over  the  last  several  years,  a  growing  U.S.  research  effort  on  ocean  acidification
has  emerged.  The  research  is  supported  by  several  federal  science  agencies  and
builds  from  two  major  oceanographic  research  programs  one  on  ocean  biogeo-

chemistry, 
(JGOFS;  http://
www1.whoi.edu/),  which  ran  from  the  late  1980s  through  the  mid-2000s,  and  one
of  marine  plankton  ecology,  U.S.  Global  Ocean  Ecosystems  Dynamics  (GLOBEC;
www.usglobec.org),  which  is  in  it’s  concluding  synthesis  phase.  Each  of  the  federal
science  agencies  involved  brings  a  specific  approach  and  research  emphasis  to  the
problem of ocean acidification.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) supports observa-
tional  networks  for  ocean  CO2,  pH  and  seawater  carbonate  system  through  a  com-
bination  research  ship  based  surveys  (CLIVAR/CO2 Repeat  Hydrography  Program;
ushydro.ucsd.edu)  and  autonomous  instruments  on  volunteer  merchant  vessels  and
moorings (http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/ocd/gcc/index.php). NOAA also is involved in
biological  impact  assessment  of  acidification  on  corals  and  coral  reefs  and  more  re-
cently fish and invertebrates. Most of NOAA funding supports scientists internal to
NOAA,  though  there  is  some  extramural  funding  of  university  researcher  through
the Climate Program Office and Sea Grant.

The  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  supports  unsolicited,  hypothesis  driven
research  on  a  wide  range  of  relevant  topics,  from  ocean  chemistry  and  physics  to
organism biology and genomics. NSF and NASA jointly fund, along with NOAA, the
CLIVAR/CO2 Repeat  Hydrography  Program,  which  is  directly  documenting  the  de-
crease in ocean pH and changes in seawater carbonate chemistry. NSF has also sup-
ported the two longest running, continuous ocean carbon time-series, one off of Ha-
waii  (http://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/hot¥jgofs.html)  and  the  other  off  of  Ber-
muda, (http://bats.bios.edu). These sustained time-series were begun in 1988 under
the  JGOFS  program  and  are  key  elements  in  directly  demonstrating  acidification
trends.  All  NSF  funding  is  extramural  to  the  university  academic  community.  As
the  only  non-mission  science  agency,  NSF  has  built  in  flexibility  to  adapt  rapidly
to  new  ideas  as  they  arise  from  the  research  community  and  to  fund  higher  risk,
discovery driven investigations.

The  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  supports  satellite  and  air-
borne remote sensing, ship-based process studies and field validation and numerical
modeling relevant to ocean ecology and biogeochemistry. Much of the research is ex-
tramural and hypothesis driven. Satellite ocean color data from NASA’s MODIS sen-
sor  and  from  GeoEYE  and  NASA’s  Sea-Viewing  Wide  Field-of-View  Sensor
(SeaWiFS)  (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/)  have  been  used  to  characterize  the
global  distributions  calcareous  plankton  and  coral  reefs.  NASA  will  also  launch  the
Orbiting  Carbon  Observatory  (OCO;  http://oco.jpl.nasa.gov)  this  December,  a  two-
year  exploratory  mission  to  measure  the  vertical  average  atmospheric  CO2 con-
centration; this data can be combined with numerical models to estimate global pat-
terns  of  the  exchange  of  carbon  dioxide  from  the  ocean  and  atmosphere.  Much  of
the  NASA  funded  ocean  ecology  and  biogeochemistry  research  is  relevant  to  ocean
acidification,  and  the  funding  specifically  focused  on  acidification  it  is  expected  to
grow in the future.

The  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  does  not  have  an  active  ocean  biogeochemical
research  program  at  the  moment;  in  the  past,  it  has  supported  relevant  work  on
measuring and modeling ocean CO2 uptake, methods of deliberate ocean carbon se-
questration,  and  ocean  environmental  genomics.  The  United  States  Geological  Sur-
vey  (USGS)  co-sponsored  a  recent  major  ocean  acidification  workshop  and  report
(Kleypas et al., 2006) that has expertise on ocean carbonate systems and coastal eco-
systems, and is supporting currently a limited research effort on acidification effects
on  coral  reefs.  Other  federal  science  agencies  with  potential  interest  and  expertise
relevant to the acidification problem and its biological repercussions include the Na-
tional Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife and the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy.

Strengths and Weaknesses of Present Interagency Effort

Despite some prominent successes, the present national investment in ocean acidi-
fication  research  is  inadequate  to  address  the  research  challenges  described  above
and  is  not  creating  the  required  comprehensive  research  program  integrating  the
chemical,  biological  and  human  dimension  aspects  of  the  acidification  problem.
There  are  issues  involving  the  direction  and  funding  level  for  both  basic  science,
which provides information on the extent of ocean acidification, and applied science,
which addresses adaptation strategies and solutions. Research and training go hand
in hand, and more resources need to be devoted to undergraduate and graduate stu-
dent  training  to  ensure  and  strong  scientific  base  for  the  future.  Further,  basic
science  efforts  within  the  U.S.  are  often  poorly  connected  with  stakeholders  and
more applied research targeting coral reef and fisheries management and conserva-
tion.  As  a  result,  the  U.S.  research  community  is  falling  behind  our  European  and

Japanese  colleagues,  who  are  already  moving  forward  on  coordinated  ocean  acidifi-
cation initiatives.

The current funding level for ocean acidification research does not support the de-
ployment  of  sufficient  ocean  monitoring  capabilities,  particularly  in  coastal  waters
where  economically  important  ecosystems  are  at  risk.  New  findings  just  released
last  week  in  Science  magazine  (Feely  et  al.,  2008)  of  corrosive,  acidified  ocean  wa-
ters  on  the  continental  shelf  along  the  U.S.  west  coast  indicate  that  acidification  is
a  problem  we  face  now,  not  decades  in  the  future.  But  these  results  from  the  first
systematic survey of seawater CO2 and acidification in North American coastal wa-
ters  also  highlight  the  difficulties  in  monitoring  ocean  chemistry  from  slow  moving
and expensive ships. New robust chemical sensor technologies exist or are being de-
veloped, and an ocean acidification observing system needs to be deployed combining
instrumented  autonomous  platforms  (moorings,  gliders,  floats)  supported  by  ship-
board surveys and process studies.

The NSF supported ocean carbon time-series stations at Hawaii and Bermuda are
pivotal  to  the  U.S.  and  international  research  community,  the  ocean  equivalent  of
the iconic Mauna Loa atmospheric CO2 record. But such long records over time, crit-
ical  for  identifying  trends  due  anthropogenic  CO2 and  acidification,  are  the  excep-
tion  not  the  rule.  With  our  present  funding  mechanisms,  it  is  difficult  to  maintain
and support long-term, sustained time-series. Each three- to five-year funding cycle,
the  principal  investigators  need  to  create  a  new  scientific  justification  for  making
continued  measurements  when  in  fact  the  unique  value  of  time-series  is  their  con-
tinuity  over  time,  the  value  growing  dramatically  as  the  records  extend  over  mul-
tiple  decades  (and  funding  cycles).  The  research  community  continues  to  struggle
with simply maintaining current capabilities, and few new time-series are being es-
tablished in different ocean environments.

In  a  similar  vein,  satellite  measurements  provide  an  unprecedented  view  of  the
temporal  variations  in  ocean  ecology.  The  ocean  is  vast,  and  the  limited  number  of
research ships move at about the speed of a bicycle, too slow to map the ocean rou-
tinely on ocean basin to global scales. By contrast, a satellite can observe the entire
globe,  at  least  the  cloud  free  areas,  in  a  few  days.  The  detection  of  gradual  trends
such as those due to ocean acidification is challenging. Currently remote sensing can
be used to estimate a number of biological and chemical properties of the ocean (e.g.,
particulate  calcite,  pCO2)  relevant  to  understanding  the  impacts  of  an  acidifying
ocean on ocean ecology and chemistry. Finding trends in these records requires long,
coherent and internally consistent, high-quality global time series. Potential gaps in
data  coverage  between  satellite  missions  are  particular  worrisome;  each  sensor  has
its  own  unique  calibration  issues,  and  without  overlap  of  missions  in  orbit,  it  is
often impossible to construct a climate quality time record the extends over multiple
missions.  At  present,  the  on-going  availability  of  high-quality,  climate  data  records
is  not  assured  during  the  transition  of  many  satellite  ocean  measurements  from
NASA research to the NOAA/DOD operational NPOESS program. For example, the
present NASA satellite ocean color sensors, needed to determine ocean plankto, are
nearing  the  end  of  their  service  life,  and  the  replacement  sensors  on  NPOESS  may
not  be  adequate  for  the  climate  community.  Further,  refocusing  of  NASA  priorities
away from Earth science may dramatically limit or full preclude new ocean satellite
missions need to characterize ocean biological dynamics.

U.S. ocean acidification research is also limited, at present, by the size and scope
of  potential  field  research  projects.  In  particular,  the  current  funding  environment
does  not  encourage  the  next  generation  of  mesocosm  (large  enclosed  tanks  or  float-
ing  bags  of  water)  and  ecosystem-scale  field  experiments  where  scientists  manipu-
late  environmental  conditions  (e.g.,  CO2,  pH)  and  then  examine  how  ocean  biology
changes.  Many  of  the  major  unresolved  questions  concerning  ocean  acidification  in-
volve  impacts  on  scales  too  large  to  test  in  the  laboratory  and  on  communities  of
organisms  and  species.  The  infrastructure  and  logistics  for  manipulative  experi-
ments  is  costly,  but  the  scientific  payoff  can  be  substantial,  and  for  some  problems
manipulation  of  the  ecosystem  provides  new  scientific  insights  that  are  not  easily
attained  in  other  ways.  Deliberate  ocean  iron  release  experiments  are  one  such  ex-
ample.  European  scientists  have  made  considerable  headway  on  ocean  acidification
using  a  dedicated  mesocosm  facility  for  water-column  plankton  studies,  and  design
studies  are  underway  for  manipulative  coral  reef  acidification  experiments,  similar
in  concept  to  terrestrial  Free  Air  Carbon  Experiment  (FACE)  system  used  to  study
CO2 fertilization  effects  on  terrestrial  grasses,  shrubs  and  trees.  The  University  of
Washington is moving forward, with State and private foundation support, on plans
for  an  ocean  mesocosm  system,  which  could  be  expanded  into  a  facility  broadly
available to the U.S. research community.

There  are  also  a  number  of  issues  with  the  coordination  and  management  across
science  agencies.  Interagency  coordination  on  U.S.  ocean  acidification  research  oc-

ocean carbon system and predicting its future behavior.

partnership 

A  key  issue  with  regards  to  ocean  acidification  is  that  the  Carbon  Cycle  Science
Program  covers  only  a  portion  of  the  ocean  acidification  problem,  namely  the  con-
trols  on  the  oceanic  uptake  of  CO2,  resulting  changes  in  seawater  chemistry  and
ocean mechanisms that could damp or accelerate climate change by altering atmos-
pheric  CO2 levels.  Key  aspects  of  the  acidification  problem  on  ecological  and  socio-
economic impacts extend well beyond the purview of the Carbon Cycle Science Pro-
gram,  however.  While  there  are  elements  of  the  U.S.  Climate  Change  Science  Pro-
gram that could address ecological research and coordination needs on ocean acidifi-
cation,  the  interactions  have  been  minimal  and  disjoint  to  date  reflecting  the  con-
flicting  demands  of  a  Program  covering  such  a  wide  research  domain  and  not  fo-
cused specifically on the ocean.

There  is  also  an  existing,  informal  interagency  effort  on  ocean  biogeochemistry
and  ocean  acidification,  the  Ocean  Carbon  and  Biogeochemistry  (OCB)  Program
(http://us-ocb.org/),  which  is  supported  by  federal  program  managers  at  the  NSF,
NASA,  and  NOAA  and  assisted  by  input  from  a  scientific  steering  committee  con-

entific steering groups overlap in membership and meet jointly. The OCB has taken
the  lead  on  organizing  a  recent  major  U.S.  ocean  acidification  workshop  last  Fall
in  La  Jolla,  CA  (Kleypas  et  al.,  2008b),  and  is  also  working  to  ensure  the  appro-
priate  international  linkages  with  emerging  and  existing  ocean  acidification  pro-
grams  supported  by  the  European  Union,  Australia  and  Japan.  The  informal  inter-
actions facilitated by OCB are working well but do not cover the full scope of acidifi-
cation  research,  for  example  the  more  fisheries  and  coral  reef  oriented  work  cur-
rently  supported  internally  within  NOAA  or  socioeconomic  components  of  the  prob-
lem.

Recommendations  on  the  Federal  Ocean  Acidification  Research  and  Moni-

toring Act

The  Federal  Ocean  Acidification  Research  and  Monitoring  Act,  H.R.  4174,  is  an
important step toward a comprehensive U.S. ocean research program. The proposed
funding level ramping to $30 million in FY 2012 will greatly enhance U.S. research
capabilities.  But  even  this  level  may  fall  short  of  true  needs,  which  are  estimated
at closer to $50–$55 million a year based on recent scientific community-wide plan-
ning  efforts.  To  put  this  in  context,  one  can  compare  against  the  funding  levels  of
prior  major  oceanographic  research  programs.  The  U.S.  JGOFS  and  U.S.  GLOBEC
programs  in  the  1990s  involved  large-scale  field  research  on  ocean  biogeochemistry
and  ecology,  similar  to  what  is  envisioned  in  a  new  ocean  acidification  program.  In
the late 1990s the NSF component of those two programs totaled about $24 million
a  year.  Adding  the  contributions  from  NOAA,  NASA  and  DOE  approximately  dou-
bled  the  total  funding  to  about  $40–$45  million  per  year  in  late  1990s  dollars
unadjusted for inflation and the rising ship operation costs. This cost estimate does
not  consider  that  a  comprehensive  acidification  program  will  include  additional  re-
search components on coral reef, fisheries, and human dimensions.

• The  total  authorization  for  FORAM  (H.R.  4174)  should  be  increased  to  $50–
$55  million  per  year,  a  reasonable  minimum  to  conduct  the  required  basic
and  applied  research  and  deliver  those  results  in  a  timely  fashion  to  stake-
holders, resource managers and policy-makers.

The U.S. scientific community is well poised to take advantage of increased fund-
ing on ocean acidification. As demonstrated by the consensus recommendations from
two  recent  major  U.S.  ocean  acidification  science  workshops  (Kleypas  et  al.,  2006;
Fabry et al., 2008b), a roadmap for a coherent acidification program is in place and
the community could move quickly toward implementing these research plans as in-
creased  funding  becomes  available.  Forward  progress  on  an  expanded  U.S.  ocean
acidification  research  program  should  not  be  delayed  waiting  for  the  completion  of

the  proposed  National  Academy  of  Sciences  study  on  ocean  acidification  research
priorities.

• The ramp-up in research funding in H.R. 4174 should be accelerated in order
to  more  quickly  get  needed  information  into  the  hands  of  stakeholders  and
decision-makers.

Other recommendations on funding approaches for ocean acidification include:

• Funds should be directly authorized to the major ocean science agencies (NSF
and  NASA),  rather  than  distributed  to  NOAA;  this  would  streamline  plan-
ning, speed research progress, and take better advantage of the unique capa-
bilities of the other agencies.
• A substantial portion of the authorized funding should be not just competitive
but  also  extramural,  to  harness  the  tremendous  capacity  of  our  university
academic  research  community—considering  the  scope  of  this  problem,  we
need to bring all available resources to bear on developing the science quickly
and efficiently.

The structure of the ocean acidification research program should remain adaptive
and  encourage  exploration  of  a  broad  range  of  scientific  areas.  Ocean  acidification
is  a  new  area  of  research,  and  many  surprises  remain  ahead.  This  is  illustrated  by
dramatic  findings  announced  just  in  the  last  few  weeks  on  accelerated  acidification
along  the  U.S.  west  coast  (Feely  et  al.,  2008)  and  increased  calcification  by  some
phytoplankton under high CO2, counter to our expectations about an increasing cor-
rosive  ocean  (Iglesias-Rodriguez  et  al.,  2008).  Ocean  acidification  research  is  at
present  multi-faceted  and  fast-moving,  and  marine  plants  and  animals  and  ocean
biogeochemical  cycle  are  affected  by  more  than  simply  reduced  seawater  pH.  There
is much that we do not understand as yet about ocean acidification and the multiple
pathways  by  which  acidification  and  rising  CO2 will  alter  the  marine  environment.
• The  current  definition  of  ‘‘ocean  acidification’’  in  the  bill  should  be  expanded
from  simply  reduced  pH  to  incorporate  the  full  suite  of  changes  in  ocean
chemistry arising from increased carbon dioxide.
• The  scope  of  the  ocean  acidification  research  program  should  leave  wide  lati-
tude  for  the  types  of  exploratory  and  discovery-based  science  investigations
generally  supported  by  the  NSF,  NASA  and  the  extramural  components  of
NOAA (e.g., NOAA Climate Program Office).

Strong interagency cooperation and coordination is critical to leverage the diverse
expertise  and  research  infrastructure  of  the  individual  federal  science  agencies,
which  tie  into  different  parts  of  the  U.S.  ocean  science  community.  But  this  may
be best accomplished through successful existing structures rather than by creating
a  new  interagency  committee.  These  include  the  National  Ocean  Partnership  Pro-
gram  (NOPP;  http://www.nopp.org)  and  the  NSTC  Joint  Subcommittee  on  Ocean
Science  and  Technology  (JSOST;  http://ocean.ceq.gov/about/jsost.html).  There  is
also  considerable  merit  to  more  informal  interagency  partnerships,  such  as  those
that supported the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study and that are now supporting
the  U.S.  Ocean  Carbon  and  Biogeochemistry  Program.  A  strong  and  on-going  dia-
logue  needs  to  be  maintained  between  federal  agency  program  managers  and  the
scientific  community,  consisting  of  both  federal  and  university  researchers,  on  the
planning, implementation and synthesis of ocean acidification research. This can be
accomplished  through  a  variety  of  mechanisms  including  scientific  steering  groups
and community workshops. Finally, ocean acidification is a global problem, and the
U.S.  and  international  research  communities  should  work  closely  to  increase  the
pace of discovery and the development of adaptation strategies.

• The  bill  should  support  a  strong,  interagency  consultative  process  on  the
science of ocean acidification with substantial and ongoing input from the sci-
entific community.
• The U.S. ocean acidification program should establish strong ties with similar
international  research  programs  and  develop  mechanisms  for  U.S.  research-
ers to participate freely in international research activities.

STATEMENT OF DR. KEN CALDEIRA, SCIENTIST, DEPARTMENT
OF  GLOBAL  ECOLOGY,  CARNEGIE  INSTITUTION  OF  WASH-
INGTON
Dr. CALDEIRA. Good morning, and thank you for inviting me here

today to testify before you.

I  am  a  scientist  and  a  concerned  citizen  who  has  been  studying
ocean chemistry and the carbon cycle for over 20 years. Last night
I  took  a  taxi  from  Dulles  to  my  hotel  building,  and  outside,  out  of
the tailpipe of that taxi came carbon dioxide gas. Today that carbon
dioxide  is  probably  mostly  over  Maryland,  could  be  impacting  the
Chesapeake Bay already. Within a few days it will certainly be im-
pacting  the  chemistry  of  the  Atlantic  Ocean.  Within  a  year  that
CO2 will travel throughout the atmosphere, around the world, and
impact  the  chemistry  of  the  upper  ocean  everywhere,  from  Alaska,
to Florida, from Antarctica, the North Pole.

When  CO2 dissolves  in  seawater,  it  becomes  carbonic  acid.  In
high  enough  concentrations  carbonic  acid  can  dissolve  seashells.
Even  at  lower  concentrations  it  can  threaten  the  survival  of  many
marine organisms.

So far we have studied just a few species. Typically, a small coral
head  or  a  few  sea  urchins  are  exposed  to  high  CO2 concentrations
in  a  fish  tank  in  a  laboratory.  It  is  just  the  beginning,  but  what
we have seen so far is very disturbing.

In  many  cases  organisms  show  malformed  or  stunted  growth.  In
many  cases  we  don’t  know  if  they  would  be  able  to  survive  in  the
wild or be able to reproduce.

We  have  little  idea  what  ocean  acidification  will  do  to  fish  eggs
or  fish  larvae  or  how  the  loss  of  organisms  at  the  base  of  the  food
chain  might  affect  the  larger  fish  that  so  many  people  have  come
to depend on.

We  do  know  that  ocean  acidification  threatens  the  survival  of
coral reefs everywhere. If we are lucky, we will lose just coral reefs
and maybe a few other sensitive things like that. But if we are un-
lucky,  we  might  see  a  wholesale  shakeup  of  marine  ecosystems
across the board.

At  this  point  we  just  don’t  know,  and  that  is  why  we  need  to

focus significant resources to understand this issue now.

We should expect surprises, so we need to monitor what is going
on. For example, our models predicted it would take over a century
for  corrosive  waters  to  start  showing  up  along  our  coasts,  but  just
two  weeks  ago  Dick  Feely  and  his  colleagues  reported  in  the  pres-
tigious  journal  Science  that  corrosive  waters,  burdened  with  fossil
fuel  carbon,  have  already  been  threatening  the  shoreline  along
parts  of  the  west  coast  of  the  U.S.  They  saw  water  corrosive
enough to start dissolving seashells.

So  we  need  better  observations  and  better  computer  models  to
help us anticipate what might occur under different policy options.
For  my  Ph.D.  research  I  studied  what  happened  to  ocean  chem-
istry  when  a  meteorite  slammed  into  the  Earth  some  65  million
years ago. At that time there was a lot of carbon dioxide and a lot
of sulfuric acid, and the oceans became acidified. Nearly everything
with a calcium carbonate shell or skeleton disappeared. Coral reefs
weren’t seen again for two million years.

You have to go back to events like this, many tens of millions of
years ago, to find anything comparable to what we are doing today
to ocean chemistry with our carbon dioxide emissions. What we do
over the next years and decades will affect ocean chemistry for tens
of  thousands  of  years  and  could  harm  marine  life  for  millions  of
years.

So  I  wholeheartedly  support  House  Resolution  4174,  the  Federal
Ocean  Acidification  Research  and  Monitoring  Act  but  wish  it  were
even more ambitious.

It  is  impossible  to  say  what  the  oceans  are  worth  to  us,  but  it
has to be at least many tens of billions of dollars per year. We are
talking  about  a  research  investment  starting  at  several  millions  of
dollars  per  year,  so  that  is  a  ratio  of  about  10,000  to  one.  That  is
like  having  a  $20,000  car  and  when  it  starts  making  funny  noises
and  not  running  right,  spending  only  $2  to  find  out  what  is  going
wrong.  With  this  level  investment  we  shouldn’t  be  surprised  when
it breaks down unexpectedly in the middle of the highway.

I  thank  you  for  your  good  work  and  your  attention  and  look  for-

ward to your questions.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Caldeira follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF KEN CALDEIRA

Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  before  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and  Environment  of  the  United  States  House  of
Representatives. I would be happy to provide more information on any of the issues
discussed below.

I  am  a  scientist  and  a  concerned  citizen.  I  have  been  studying  ocean  chemistry
and carbon cycle for over 20 years. I worked for a Department of Energy Laboratory
for 12 years, and co-led the DOE center for research on ocean carbon sequestration.
I  led  the  writing  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  chapter  on
ocean  carbon  storage.  Recently,  I  acted  in  the  capacity  of  the  representative  of  the

I  now  work  for  the  Carnegie  Institution  of  Washington,  a  non-profit  organization
dedicated  to  ‘‘investigation,  research,  and  discovery  [and]  . . .  the  application  of
knowledge to the improvement of mankind. . ..’’

Every  time  we  drive  a  car,  carbon  dioxide  gas  comes  out  of  the  taxi  tailpipe  and

goes right into the air.

Within  a  year,  that  CO2 will  travel  throughout  the  atmosphere  and  impact  the
chemistry of the ocean surface everywhere—from Alaska to Florida, from Antarctica
to the North Pole.

That CO2 will stay in the oceans, changing ocean chemistry, for tens of thousands

of years.

When  CO2 dissolves  in  seawater,  it  becomes  carbonic  acid.  In  high  enough  con-
centrations,  carbonic  acid  can  dissolve  sea  shells.  Even  at  lower  concentrations,  it
can threaten the survival of many marine organisms.

So  far,  we’ve  studied  just  a  few  organisms—typically  a  small  coral  head  or  a  few
sea  urchins  will  be  exposed  to  high  CO2 concentrations  in  a  fish  tank  in  a  labora-
tory. It’s just a beginning, but what we’ve seen so far is very disturbing.

In many cases, organisms show malformed or stunted growth. In many cases, we

don’t know if it would be able to survive in the wild or be able to reproduce.

We  have  little  idea  what  ocean  acidification  will  do  to  fish  eggs,  or  fish  larvae,
or  how  the  loss  of  organisms  at  the  base  of  the  food  chain  might  affect  the  larger
fish that so many people have come to depend on.

In  general,  we  have  little  idea  what  the  ecosystem-scale  consequences  of  ocean

acidification might be.

Corals are perhaps the best studied kind of organism.
Several  of  us  use  computer  models  to  predict  how  future  CO2 would  affect  ocean
chemistry.  If  carbon  dioxide  emissions  continue  along  current  trends,  within  a  few
decades  there  will  be  no  water  left  anywhere  in  the  ocean  with  the  kind  of  chem-
istry  that  has  supported  coral  growth  over  the  past  thousands  and  even  millions  of
years.

CO2 threatens the survival of coral reefs everywhere.
If  we’re  lucky,  we’ll  lose  just  coral  reefs  and  maybe  a  few  other  things.  If  we’re
unlucky, we might see a wholesale shake-up of marine ecosystems across the board.
At this point, we just don’t know, and that’s why we need to focus significant re-

sources to understand this issue now.

We should expect surprises, so we need to monitor what is going on.
For  example,  our  models  predicted  it  would  take  over  a  century  for  corrosive

water to start showing up along our coasts.

But, just two weeks ago, Dick Feely and his colleagues reported in the prestigious
journal  Science,  that  corrosive  waters,  burdened  with  fossil-fuel  carbon,  have  al-
ready been threatening the shoreline along parts the west coast of the U.S.

They saw water corrosive enough to start dissolving sea shells.
We  need  better  observations  and  better  computer  models  to  help  us  anticipate

what might occur under different policy options.

Our  computer  models  must  get  much  better  at  representing  the  coasts  and  rep-
resenting what goes on in ecosystem dynamics. These models must be based on and
tested with careful observations, made both by scientists on ships in the oceans and
by scientists working in the laboratory.

For my Ph.D. research, I studied what happened to ocean chemistry when a mete-
orite  slammed  into  the  Earth  some  65  million  years  ago.  At  that  time,  there  was
a  lot  of  carbon  dioxide  and  a  lot  of  sulfuric  acid,  and  the  oceans  became  acidified.
Nearly  everything  with  a  calcium  carbonate  shell  or  skeleton  disappeared.  Coral

reefs weren’t seen again for two million years.

You  have  to  go  back  to  events  like  this,  many  tens  of  millions  of  years  ago,  to
find  anything  comparable  to  what  we  are  doing  to  ocean  chemistry  today  with  our
carbon dioxide emissions.

What  we  do  over  the  next  years  and  decades  will  affect  ocean  chemistry  for  tens

of thousands of years and could harm marine life for millions of years.

Ocean acidification will stress ecosystems. One important thing we can do now is
to reduce other stresses on ecosystems, including over fishing, coastal pollution, loss
of  coastal  wetlands,  and  so  on,  so  we  can  give  the  oceans  a  fighting  chance  while
we figure out how to address the underlying problem.

There may be engineering options to help protect small bays or semi-enclosed ma-
rine sanctuaries, but the only way to really save the oceans is to greatly reduce car-
bon dioxide emissions soon.

We have investigated the potential to dissolve minerals that would add alkalinity
to  the  oceans,  counteracting  the  acidity  from  the  carbon  dioxide.  This  is  essentially
accelerating  a  process  that  would  occur  naturally  over  many  thousands  of  years.
DOE patented the idea, but hasn’t pursued a careful assessment or its development.

It looks feasible from an engineering standpoint, but at this point it is little more
than an idea and a few preliminary calculations. My guess is that it may only prove
feasible  at  the  scale  of  a  small  bay  or  other  semi-enclosed  area,  but  other  people
think it may prove feasible at much larger scales.

Again,  we  don’t  really  know.  This  is  another  area  in  which  the  research  is  just

waiting to be done.

We  need  to  investigate  what  mitigation  options  might  be  available  to  reduce  the

impacts of carbon dioxide on the marine environment.

I  would  like  to  see  every  federal  agency  that  might  get  funded  under  this  H.R.
4174 send a signal through the bureaucracy to their scientists and technicians ask-
ing  them  what  capabilities  and  ideas  they  might  have  to  bring  to  bear  on  this  im-
portant problem.

And then I would like to see the agencies coordinate their activities, taking advan-

tage of existing structures.

I wholeheartedly support House Resolution 4174, the Federal Ocean Acidification

Research and Monitoring Act, but wish it were even more ambitious.

It’s  impossible  to  say  what  the  oceans  are  worth  to  us,  but  it  has  to  be  at  least
many  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  per  year.  We  are  talking  about  a  research  invest-
ment  starting  at  several  millions  of  dollars  per  year.  So  that’s  a  ratio  of  about  ten
thousand to one.

That’s like having a 20,000 dollar car and when it starts making funny noises and
not  running  right,  spending  only  two  bucks  to  find  out  what’s  going  wrong.  We
shouldn’t be surprised when it breaks down unexpectedly in the middle of the high-
way.

SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS

Among Caldeira’s scientific contributions are:

(1)  Ocean  Acidification.  Caldeira  was  lead  author  of  the  first  publication  in  which
the term ‘‘ocean acidification’’ appeared (Caldeira and Wickett, Nature, 2003), show-
ing  that  anticipated  changes  in  ocean  chemistry  are  large  when  compared  with  the
range of change in ocean chemistry experienced in the geologic past. This work has
been  followed  up  by  more  detailed  investigation  for  a  range  of  CO2 emission  and

stabilization scenarios (e.g., Caldeira and Wickett, JGR, 2005) and analysis of com-
bined threats to corals (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., Science, 2007).
(2)  Land-cover  change  and  climate.  Caldeira  has  participated  in  studies  showing
that  growing  forests  can  warm  the  Earth  by  absorbing  solar  radiation,  and  that
these effects can be much larger than cooling effects of carbon dioxide storage (Bala
et al., PNAS, 2007; Gibbard et al., GRL, 2005).
(3)  Energy  systems  and  climate  modelling.  Caldeira  has  investigated  the  amount  of
carbon-emission-free  energy  that  would  be  required  to  prevent  further  climate
change  under  a  range  of  assumptions,  and  investigated  what  types  of  energy  sys-
tems  could  supply  this  power  (Caldeira  et  al.,  Science,  2003;  Hoffert  et  al.,  Science,
2002; Hoffert et al., Nature, 1998).
(4) Intentional climate modification. Caldeira has participated in studies on the pos-
sible  effects  of  intentional  climate  modification  on  Earth’s  climate  system  and  bio-
sphere  (Govindasamy  and  Caldeira,  GRL,  2000;  Govindasamy  et  al.,  GRL,  2002;
Govindasamy et al., Glob. Planet. Chg., 2003; Matthews and Caldeira, PNAS, 2007).
(5)  Ocean  carbon  storage.  Caldeira  was  coordinating  lead  author  of  an  IPCC  report
on carbon storage in the ocean (Caldeira et al, IPCC, 2005). He has investigate how
long carbon is retained in the ocean (Caldeira et al., GRL, 2002) and proposed ways
of  reducing  the  ocean  chemical  effects  of  ocean  carbon  storage  (e.g.,  Caldeira  and
Rau, GRL, 2000).
(6)  Coupled  atmosphere/ocean  carbon-cycle  modelling.  Caldeira  was  part  of  the  re-
search  team  that  produced  the  first  studies  by  an  American  group  on  the  three-di-
mensional  interactions  of  Earth’s  climate  and  carbon  cycles.  Caldeira  was  respon-
sible for the ocean biogeochemical components of this modelling effort and proposed
the overall experimental design (Bala et al., Tellus B, 2006; Bala et al., J. Climate,
2005; Govindasamy et al., Tellus, 2005; Thompson et al, GRL, 2004).
(7) Calcification and long-term ocean chemistry. Caldeira has shown that both shal-
low-water  calcifiers  (Caldeira  and  Rampino,  Paleoceanography,  1993)  and  deep-
water  calcifiers  (Ridgwell,  Kennedy,  and  Caldeira,  Science,  2003)  play  important
roles stabilizing the global carbon cycle and climate.
(8)  Ocean  uptake  of  anthropogenic  carbon  dioxide.  Caldeira  and  Duffy  (Science,
2000)  showed  that  transport  along  surface  of  constant  density  was  the  primary
mode  of  uptake  of  fossil-fuel  carbon  dioxide  from  the  atmosphere  in  the  Southern
Ocean.
(9) Ocean observations as tests of models. Caldeira has been a pioneer of using obser-
vations of tracers such as CFCs and radiocarbon in the ocean and marine organisms
(e.g., corals) to test ocean models (Doney et al., GBC, 2004; Matsumoto et al., GRL,
2004; Grumet et al., GBC, 2005; Fallon et al., 2003).

New  York  Times,  the  Washington  Post,  Los  Angeles  Times,  U.S.  News  and  World
Report, and USA Today. He has appeared on radio many times, most often on NPR
(Science  Friday,  Bryant  Park  Project)  and  BBC  World  Service  Radio  (Business
Daily).  He  has  also  discussed  his  work  on  television  (BBC  World,  The  Weather
Channel,  The  Discovery  Channel,  etc.),  both  on  news  programs  and  in  documen-
taries.

Caldeira now has a highly privileged position at the Carnegie Institution, wherein
his  only  job  responsibility  is  ‘‘to  make  important  scientific  discoveries.’’  His  salary
is  covered  for  the  length  of  his  career  by  the  Carnegie  Institution  endowment  and
other  private  foundation  sources.  Caldeira  also  holds  the  position  of  Professor  (by
courtesy)  in  the  Stanford  University  Department  of  Environmental  Earth  System
Science.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
Mr. Warren, you are recognized.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  BRAD  WARREN,  DIRECTOR,  PRODUCTIVE
OCEANS PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM, SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES
PARTNERSHIP
Mr. WARREN. Thank you. I am very pleased to be here, and I ap-
preciate very much the opportunity. It is an honor, and it is heart-
ening to see the problem drawing real attention.

The  scientists  who  are  here  today  and  some  of  their  colleagues
deserve medals I think. I very much agree with Jay Inslee on that
point.  If  it  weren’t  for  them,  we  wouldn’t  know  this  were  coming.
We  might  have  driven  right  off  the  cliff  without  knowing  it  was
there.

The  early  warning  that  these  guys  have  made  possible  through
developing  the  technologies  and  the  monitoring  tools  and  through
literally  volunteer  efforts  in  some  cases,  uncompensated,  make  it
possible for us to be literally the first generation in human history
that  had  a  chance  against  a  problem  of  this  magnitude.  No  prior
generation  could  have  taken  this  on.  We  might  just  be  able  to  do
it. We’ve got a fighting chance.

My background, 25 years as a journalist and consultant working
in  fisheries  and  oceans.  I  was  the  editor  of  Pacific  Fishing  Maga-
zine  for  eight  years,  built  the  Productive  Oceans  Partnership,  a
program of SFP, because acidification looks to be an overriding sus-
tainability challenge for fisheries.

I believe the seafood industry will play a major role in defending
the  ocean  that  feeds  us  from  this  problem,  and  that  is  the  center-
piece of my work.

Disclaimers  are  important  here.  We  advise  but  do  not  represent
the industry. They speak for themselves. Most of them listen, some
agree,  some  don’t,  to  the  kinds  of  things  we  put  in  front  of  them.
There  is  generally  strong  agreement  on  the  importance  of  this

problem,  but  there  are  differences  of  opinion  about  how  urgent  it
is.

Our  view,  not  necessarily  those  of  the  folks  we  know  in  the  in-
dustry  and  work  with,  we  support  emissions  reduction  policies  in
the  U.S.  and  globally.  We  support  national  investment  in  research
like this. This is an example of the sort of thing. We don’t endorse
particular bills. We encourage the people we work with to do that.
We are not a lobby group.

Acidification  is  a  more  clear-cut  problem  for  fisheries  than  is
global  warming,  and  that  makes  it  a  lot  easier  to  communicate
about with this industry.

Early  impacts  of  acidification  for  fisheries  are  in  the  sort  of
vague area. More still, there may be some that are becoming more
clear,  but  mostly  it  is  a  new  source  of  uncertainty  concerning  fish-
ery  productivity  and  for  the  financial  planning  of  enterprises  in
fisheries.

For  some  it  may  possibly  be  an  immediate  threat.  Some  of  the
oyster farmers have raised issues that make it sound pretty urgent
now.

Acidification  risks  for  the  seafood  industry.  Obviously,  the  first
risk  is  reduced  productivity  in  fish  stocks.  If  we  have  reduced  pro-
ductivity of key plankton species that they eat, we would expect to
see fewer fish. We would expect to see things like recruitment fail-
ures  in  stocks.  That  is  where  the  young  fail  to  grow  up  because
there is not enough food for them. Reduced productivity in shellfish
is another of the possibilities.

Risk of market confusion. Although supply will likely diminish if
this  problem  continues  unabated,  there  is  pretty  strong  science-
based  governance  of  fisheries  in  a  lot  of  places,  for  example,  in
Alaska,  and  that  will  likely  ensure  that  you  can  eat  the  fish  on
your  plate  in  good  conscience.  There  is  some  concern  that  con-
sumers might not be able to keep track of that fact and might just
panic.

Then  there  is  a  third  risk,  that  is  a  significant  risk,  that  the  in-
dustry  faces  in  this,  and  that  is  really  panic-button  management.
If  we  don’t  know  enough  about  the  problem,  we  have  little  to  do
that  amounts  to  a  rational,  firm-minded  management.  Manage-
ment  of  fisheries  is  a  little  like  monetary  policy.  You  don’t  want
Bernanke  having  a  panic-button  response  to  minor  changes  in  the
inflation rate or, in the case of fisheries, if you have an over-fishing
problem,  well,  you  cut  back  on  fishing.  In  this  case  under-reaction
is probably worse than overreaction, but there is still an underlying
difference  that  is  very  important  to  bear  in  mind  here.  The  risks
that fishery managers are used to facing are mostly reversible. You
can,  if  you  over-fish  once,  you  slow  down,  you  fish  less  later.  The
fish  generally  come  back.  This  in  human  terms  is  an  irreversible
change. When this happens, we can’t take it back.

Is  acidification  hurting  fisheries  now?  There  is  very,  very  little
research  on  this.  Fundamentally  we  don’t  have  very  good  answers
on that. It may possibly be hurting oysters right now. There is tes-
timony  on  May  27  from  Brett  Bishop  representing  West  Coast
Growers, and we will get to that in a little bit. I recommend highly
looking at the testimony he submitted last week.

Other  potential  signs  of  known  change  that  have  not  yet  been
studied  for  relation  to  acidification  include  scallops  in  some  areas
show slow growth, fragile shells. We don’t know the cause. Reduced
forage  abundance  in  places  like  the  Bering  Sea  and  I  think  many
others as well. We don’t know the cause. That is the stuff that fish
eat.

West  Coast  hypoxic  dead  zone,  and  there  are  salmon  effects
going  on.  We  don’t  know  whether  this  is  driven  by  greenhouse
gases  or  not.  There  are  a  lot  of  people  who  think  it  is.  There  is
some scientific discussion of that question. I think it deserves clos-
er look.

Fish stocks that show long-term declines despite very low fishing
pressure. There are some of those around. We don’t know they are
declining.  Some  of  them  look  like  they  might  be  candidates  for  an
acidification affect. We just don’t know. There are likely to be mul-
tiple  effects  causing  these  things,  and  it  is  worth  bearing  in  mind
acidification  is  not  the  only  one  that  can  do  it.  But  we  have  never
looked, so we don’t know.

Shellfish  farmers,  hypoxia  contributed  to  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions  by  many.  This  is  a  quote  from  Brett  Bishop  from  Little
Skookum Shellfish, who delivered this in testimony last week. ‘‘The
current  situation  puts  both  the  marine  ecosystem  and  shellfish
growers  in  extreme  jeopardy.’’  And  then  regarding  acidification,
which  is  a  longer-term  issue  for  him  still,  ‘‘This  acidity  dissolves
calcium  carbonate,  the  stuff  that  shells  are  made  of.  If  diatoms,
corals, and shellfish succumb to this, it might collapse not only the
shellfish industry but also the entire marine food chain.’’

Now,  this  is  a  question.  This  is  not  a  statement  that  we  know
what  is  happening  to  Greenland  turbot.  Greenland  turbot  has
shown  recruitment  failures  for  many  years.  There  are  some  signs
recently  that  they  are  coming  back  a  little  bit,  but  if  you  look  at
this  graph,  it  goes  back  to  1964,  if  I  recall,  and  goes  forward  to
2007.  You  can  see  that  there  used  to  be  a  lot  of  them.  The  ampli-
tude  of  those  bumps  was  high,  and  there  were  lots  of  fish.  You  go
forward  in  time,  and  you  get  less  fish,  and  they  show  some  signs
of recovery recently, but it is a generally downward trend, and the
overall biomass index is sharply down.

We  really  don’t  know  why.  It  is  probably  not  because  of  fishing.
Fishing rates have been, harvest rates have been below seven per-
cent  since  1984,  and  they  are  currently  below  1.8  percent.  Those
are  extremely  low  harvest  rates.  This  is  almost  certainly  not
caused by fishing.

So  it  is  an  interesting  case.  It  is  a  fish  that  lives  pretty  deep.
Deep water would be more likely to be affected. It might be a can-
didate to look at.

Some  info  fisheries  will  need.  People  are  going  to  need  to  know
which commercial species are more vulnerable, which ones are less
so,  how  fast  is  this  happening,  will  fish  abundance  change  quickly
or  slowly?  How  do  we  estimate  sustainable  yields  when  the  ocean
is  changing  in  these  ways?  That  is  a  critical  question.  You  got  to
figure it out to be able to manage fisheries.

Adaptive  seafood  production  methods.  Is  there  anything  we  can
do  to  keep  growing  things  we  like  to  eat  as  the  ocean  changes?  In
a high CO2 ocean there are a lot of questions around that.

58

And  then,  obviously,  we  are  going  to  need,  and  this  is  going  to
be true in the industry and the management community, technical
and policy tools to address the root problem of high CO2.

Industry  perspectives  that  we  have  picked  up  from  people  we
talk to about FOARAM, these are not our own views. I am just re-
laying what I pick up from people we talk to all the time. The need
for  research  is  very  well  accepted.  People  agree,  and  they  support
this thing in principle.

They do have some reservations. A major one is the potential for
robbing  Peter  to  pay  Paul.  It  is  already  the  case  that  regular  fish
stock surveys are being suspended in some cases for budgetary rea-
sons.  That  is  a  real-time,  current  need.  We  need  that  information
to  manage  fisheries.  If  we  suspend  more  of  them  in  order  to  put
money  into  this,  it  will  be  very  much  robbing  Peter  to  pay  Paul.
You  kind  of  have  to  know  how  many  fish  you  have  to  be  able  to
catch  them  responsibly.  And  figuring  that  out  on  a  regular  basis
is also one of the ways we will know whether fish stocks are being
affected  by  this.  This  is  a  monitoring  tool  that  should  be  main-
tained.

And so people are very strongly in favor of more research on this
problem and doing it not by whacking sort of the obvious candidate
to  whack  in  the  budget,  which  would  be  surveys.  We  really  need
both.

And with that I thank you for your time, and I think we are open

for questions.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Warren.  I  appreciate  that.
At  this  point  we  will  go  into  our  first  round  of  questions.  I  will
recognize  myself  for  the  first  five  minutes,  and  I  will  start  with
you, Dr. Doney.

INTERAGENCY COORDINATION

H.R.  4174  establishes  a  new  interagency  committee  to  develop  a
research  and  monitoring  program  for  ocean  acidification  studies.
You indicate we should use the existing interagency committees to
coordinate the program. It seems the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean
Science  and  Technology,  JSOST,  and  the  Interagency  Committee
on  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program,  I  tried  to  make  a  word
out of that but it doesn’t fit, are both involved in this issue.

Would you recommend we direct one of these to take the lead in
developing  a  plan  for  the  program  with  a  budget  to  support  the
program activities?

Dr.  DONEY.  Yes.  I  have  talked  to  a  number  of  people  across  the
federal  agencies  on  this,  and  one  of  the  problems  with  the  Global
Change  Research  Program  is  they  have  a  lot  of  other  things  on
their plate. They have to look at the atmosphere, the land, and cli-
mate.  This  is  a  very  focused  ocean  program,  and  we  need  to  basi-
cally  look  at  it  from  the  basic  science  end  all  the  way  up  to  fish-
eries and human impacts.

62

So  given  the  current  structures,  I  think  JSOST  would  be  the
most  likely  candidate,  but  that  would  have  to  be  something  that
would have to be worked out in detail with them if this moves for-
ward.

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION MONITORING

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Dr.  Feely,  how  extensive  is  the  corrosive
acidified  water  that  you  found  during  your  research  last  summer
along the West Coast? Are there other coastal regions in the world
that could be experiencing ocean acidification as well?

Dr.  FEELY.  This  effort,  we  thought  we  might  see  it  somewhere
along  our  coast,  and  what  surprised  us  the  most  about  the  study
is that going from Queen Charlottetown in Canada through all the
Washington,  Oregon,  California,  and  into  Baja,  California,  we  saw
it everywhere. It ranged in depth from near the surface off of Cali-
fornia to depths around 40 to 80 meters everywhere we looked.

What this implies is that we need to look further. It probably oc-
curs all the way down through South America and probably up into
Alaskan  coastal  waters,  which  are  naturally  shallower  in  the  wa-
ters than anywhere on the planet.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Well,  now  that  you  know  that  this  exists,
what strategies are being put into place to continue monitoring it?
Dr. FEELY. Well, we have been working with our State and local
agencies  as  well  as  the  Federal  Government,  put  together  a  coali-
tion  of  efforts  to  have  a  monitoring  effort  along  the  Continental
Shelf,  particularly  a  series  of  moorings,  and  we  are  recommending
that  we  would  also  have  continued  surveys.  I  have  a  proposal  for
a  survey  again  next  summer,  and  we  would  like  to  continue  that
on a more regular basis. And we are hoping with new technologies
such  as  gliders  and  floats,  that  we  could  put  carbon  system  moni-
toring  instruments  on  the  gliders  and  floats  and  have  regular  sur-
veys  with  the  gliders  and  floats,  which  would  provide  us  the  right
kind of observational data to allow us to monitor this in real time.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

Chairman  LAMPSON.  What  cooperation  are  you  finding,  particu-
larly  among  other  places  in  the  world?  Are  our  scientists  working
together with other folks in other countries?

Dr.  FEELY.  Oh,  absolutely.  Several  of  us  are  on  the  advisory
panel  for  the  POKA  Program,  which  is  a  European  program,  and
I have been participating in their national program development ef-
forts.  We  are  working  directly  with  the  Canadians  and  the  Mexi-
cans  on  our  Continental  Shelf  programs,  and  I  am  also  working
with the Japanese and the Koreans on this effort.

Chairman LAMPSON. Are we pretty much up to speed with them,
or  are  there  some  areas  that  may  be  more  advanced  in  support  of
this than what we in America are?

Dr.  FEELY.  Generally  speaking  our  international  colleagues  are
looking  to  us  for  leadership  in  developing  the  monitoring  activities
because  we  have  some  of  the  best  instrumentation  for  monitoring
this problem within the United States. But our colleagues in other
countries  have  done  a  very  nice  job  of  looking  at  physiological  re-
sponses, particularly for phytoplankton and zooplankton, corals. So

we  want  to  interact  with  our  colleagues  that  have  a  great  deal  of
experience in this arena.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
Mr. Inglis, I will recognize you for five minutes.
Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MORE ON INTERAGENCY COORDINATION

I  think  each  of  you  mentioned  something  about  who  is  best
equipped  to  help  lead  this  effort,  but  I  admit  to  being  somewhat
mystified at the conclusion of that. I am not sure I am drawing any
real conclusions about how best to organize this effort.

Anybody want to take a shot at telling me, giving us the specific
proposal? If you don’t like the bill, and apparently each of you had
some  criticisms  of  the  bill  in  your  testimony,  as  to  how  it  should
be  structured.  I  mean,  if  you—is  it,  first  of  all,  is  it  a  good  idea  to
try  to  orchestrate  this  effort?  And  if  so,  then  who  is  the  best  con-
ductor of the symphony?

Dr.  DONEY.  I  will  take  a  crack  at  that.  I  think  one  of  the  prob-
lems with the way we have looked at the bill is that the funds and
the leadership are all directed at NOAA, where the expertise with-
in  the  Federal  Government  is  really  spread  over  multiple  agencies
with  NSF  and  NASA  having  an  equal  role  on  many  of  these  prob-
lems.

And I think the perception of the community is that we just want
to  make  sure  that  those  agencies  have  an  equal  seat  at  the  table,
and  one  of  the  ways  to  do  that  is  to  authorize  funds  directly  to
those  agencies  rather  than  having  the  funds  sent  to  NOAA  and
then have it trickle out to the other agencies.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  so,  Dr.  Feely,  what  was  your  reaction  to  that?

It is a challenge to you being the conductor, I suppose.

Dr. FEELY. Well, I think it is NOAA’s viewpoint that they would
be  very  happy  to  coordinate  the  interagency  activities  through  the
JSOST  Subcommittee  has  been  recommended.  Dr.  Spinrad  is  one
of  the  co-chairs  of  the  JSOST  Committee,  and  he  was  very  com-
fortable  with  that  position,  and  we  feel  very  strongly  that  NOAA
should  be  playing  a  leadership  role  in  this  process  and  are  willing
to do so. But we fully agree that we have to do this in a cooperative
manner  with  our  sister  agencies,  as  we  have  always  done  in  the
past and are very comfortable with that relationship.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  speaking  of  which,  that  happens  now,  right?  In
other  words,  I  imagine  there  is  informal  contact  among  the  agen-
cies  on  these  kind  of  questions.  And  so  if  the  bill  is  mostly  helpful
in that it provides additional funding for support staff or somebody
that is going to actually run the symphony or what? I mean, what
role would the bill play in helping what already goes on, I suppose,
with some contact between the agencies?

Dr. FEELY. Well, certainly there is a lot of coordination activities,
and  that  takes  personnel  to  handle  those  coordination  activities.
And I think some of the support would have to go into coordinating
activities,  developing  research  priorities,  making  sure  that  there
are  gaps  that  are  being  filled,  and  that  the  individual  agencies
carry out their roles in a cooperative manner.

64

And  this  type  of  interagency  cooperation  takes  a  lot  of  coordina-
tion and therefore, some support to carry that out. This is what we
are looking for with this bill in particular.

The  second  point  is  that  the  amount  of  resources  that  are  pres-
ently available to do ocean acidification research as Scott has point-
ed  out  certainly  is  not  adequate  to  the  task  at  hand,  and  we  sus-
pect  that  the  requests  for  funds  that  have  been  laid  out  by  Dr.
Doney is certainly appropriate for the research that we are looking
to see happen.

Mr. INGLIS. Yes. Dr. Caldeira.
Dr.  CALDEIRA.  There  is  another  dimension  to  this  coordination,
and  that  is  to  make  sure  that  the  people  representing  each  of  the
agencies really understand the capabilities and resources that each
agency has to bring to bear on this problem. This is a problem that
spans from biology to oceanography to physics and so on.

So it would be very useful if the civil servants at the top of these
organizations would send a signal down through the bureaucracies
to  ask  the  scientists  working,  you  know,  in  the  field  exactly  what
are  the  various  skills,  capabilities,  resources  within  the  agencies
that  could  be  brought  to  bear  on  this  problem.  Because  I  have  a
feeling  that  there  are  people  at  the  top  of  the  agencies  that  don’t
really understand what their capabilities really are in this area.

Mr. INGLIS. Very helpful. One thing I might point out, Dr. Feely,
on the excellent trip that Dr. Baird led to Antarctica that included
the  stop  in  Australia,  we  saw  wonderful  cooperation  between
NOAA  and  the  Australians  with  the  Great  Barrier  Reef,  and  it
really is, I think, tremendously helpful to our position in the world
to be involved in that way. And so I am particularly pleased to see
NOAA doing that and working so closely with the Australians. Ac-
tually,  a  couple  of  Australians  who  worked  for  you,  that  work  for
NOAA in Townsville. So that is really neat.

Dr.  FEELY.  Yes.  In  fact,  they  have  invited  us  to  participate  with

them even further as of two weeks ago.

Mr. INGLIS. That is very helpful.
Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. McNerney, you are recognized.

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION MODELS

Mr. MCNERNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr. Caldeira, my background is in modeling, computer modeling.
How  sophisticated  would  you  say  the  models  of  ocean  acidity  are
in  comparison  to  the  atmospheric  CO2 models  that  are  out  there
now?

Dr.  CALDEIRA.  I  would  say  they  are  approximately  at  a  similar
level  of  development.  The  open  oceans  near  surface  environment,
very  simple  models,  are  adequate  in  the  sense  that  for,  at  least  to
understand the chemistry. In fact, you could take a bucket of water
and  put  it  under  a  bell  jar  and  change  the  CO2 and  get  a  pretty
good estimate of how the surface chemistry would change.

But the kind of stuff that Dick Feely observed off the west coast
of  the  U.S.  involves  very  detailed  processes  along  coastal  environ-
ments and the current generation of models is typically very coarse
and  does  not  represent  the  kind  of  features  that  Dick  and  his  col-
leagues  were  observing.  And  so  the  representation  of  coastal  proc-
esses is very primitive.

65

Furthermore, the representation of ecosystem processes is nearly
non-existent,  and  part  of  that  is  due  to  the  lack  of  fundamental
science  and  our  lack  of  understanding  of  ecosystem  processes,  but
also there is just a lack of modeling in there.

And  so  I  would  say  that  the  representation  of  coastal  environ-
ments and ecosystem properties, maybe Scott would like to amplify
it.

Dr.  DONEY.  Yeah.  I  suggest,  one  of  the  key  things  that  we  need
to  do  is  bridge  between  the  basic  science  and  the  basic  modeling
that  Ken  and  I  do  and  the  kind  of  models  that  resource  managers
need. You know, they need specific models for specific species; oys-
ters,  clams,  scallops.  And  so  there  is  a  big  gap  right  now  on  the
biological side, you know, of how to go from what we are seeing in
sort  of  the  fish  tank  experiments  to  something  that  a  resource
manager  could  use  to  set  sustainable  limits  or  set  up  marine-pro-
tected areas, things like that.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  So  it  is  not  the  computer  resources  that  is  lim-

iting you. It is the basic science.

Dr.  DONEY.  You  know,  we  could  always  use  a  bigger  computer.
Every modeler will tell you that, but right now I think we are fun-
damentally limited by our scientific understanding.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  So  you  don’t  have  enough,  not  you  personally,
but  there  is  not  enough  understanding  to  understand,  to  predict
whether  there  will  be  sort  of  sudden  shifts  or  gradual  shifts  in
there ecosystems, say sudden being 10 years or less.

Dr.  DONEY.  The  experience  in  looking  back  at  historical  data
with ecosystems is that there are often thresholds or tipping points,
and  to  date  we  typically  don’t  know  that  we  are  at  a  threshold
until it is already behind us in the rearview mirror.

And  that  is  something  we  really  need  to  be  concerned  about,  is
are  the  fisheries  today  reaching  a  threshold  where  ocean  acidifica-
tion along with warming and over-fishing will tip them beyond the
spot that they can’t recover from.

THE EFFECT OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ON CALCIFYING

ORGANISMS

Mr. MCNERNEY. Thank you.
Dr.  Kleypas,  you  said  that  it  makes  it—the  acidity  makes  it
harder  for  organisms  to  secrete  carbonate.  Is  that—it  doesn’t  just
eat  it  away.  It  makes  it  harder  for  them  to  secrete  it  biologically?
Dr.  KLEYPAS.  It  does  both,  you  can  think  that  organisms,  most
organisms, responds to something called the saturation level in the
oceans. That means if there is an adequate amount of calcium and
carbonate  ions  to  build  those  shells.  We  used  to  think  it  was  on/
off  switch,  so  below  that  level  they  would  stop  calcifying.  Above
that level they would calcify. Now we realize it is more like a dim-
mer switch.

So  the  higher  the  saturation  rate,  the  more  they  calcify.  And  so
they will—many organisms will change the rate at which they cal-
cify  or  the  amount  at  which  they  lay  down  relative  to  that,  you
know, the level of ocean acidification.

MITIGATION OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Then  what  we  don’t  have  or  you  don’t  have,  is
there some idea of what mitigation is being discussed and what the
side effects of that, of those processes might be?

Dr.  KLEYPAS.  You  are  talking  about  local  mitigation  in  terms  of

say on a coral reef, what we can do?

Mr. MCNERNEY. Right. Local or global or any kind of mitigation.
Dr.  KLEYPAS.  The  only  way  to  really  stop  ocean  acidification  is
to stop CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, because the ocean at
the  surface  is  so  well  mixed  with  the  atmospheric  concentration
that as long as you increase it in the atmosphere, the ocean acidifi-
cation will increase as well.

Now, there have been talks at a very small scale, the scale of an
atoll  or  a  small  bay,  of  putting  in  sources  of,  you  know,  another
chemical that would raise the pH back up, like the way you change
pH  in  a  swimming  pool  or  an  aquarium.  But  it  is,  the  scale  would
be  very  small  and  expensive.  So  we  can’t  do  it  for  most  of  the
oceans.

Dr.  KLEYPAS.  Some  would  and  some  wouldn’t.  It  depends  on

what you put in to buffer the system.
Mr. MCNERNEY. Okay. Thank you.
I yield back.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Mr.  Bartlett,  you  are  recognized  for  five

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much. I was very pleased to note
that almost all of you kept repeating over and over, we don’t know,
we  just  don’t  know.  People  out  in  the  working  world  don’t  under-
stand  the  scientists,  and  that  is  why  we  are  scientists  because  we
just don’t know. This is why we do research. Thank you very much
for taking that position.

Dr.  Kleypas,  you  mentioned  that  in  your  little  aquarium  when
the  algae  increased  that  was  bad.  If  I  was  an  algae-eating  critter
in  the  ocean,  I  don’t  think  I  would  think  that  was  bad.  I  think  it
was Dr. Doney who mentioned that there will be biological winners
and  biological  losers,  and  the  oceans  will  be  very  different  with
higher  CO2.  I  am  not  sure  whether  that  will  be  bad  or  whether
that will be good.

But there is always a risk that it will be bad, and if you are con-
cerned  about  the  rising  CO2 levels,  I  would  suggest  that  there  are
two other groups that you need to lock arms with, groups that you
may not ordinarily identify with.

One  is  a  group  that  is  really  concerned  about  national  security,
the  fact  that  we  have  only  two  percent  of  the  world’s  oil,  and  we
use  25  percent  of  the  world’s  oil,  getting  much  of  it  as  the  Presi-
dent said from countries that don’t even like us. To solve that prob-
lem  what  you  need  to  do,  of  course,  is  to  move  away  from  fossil
fuels  to  renewables,  which  will,  of  course,  stop  the  CO2 rate  in-
crease.

There is a second group that you need to identify with. Of course,
you  are  a  subset  of  the  global  warming  climate  change  group,  and
so  you  already,  I  suspect,  are  identifying  with  those.  The  geo-

67

political  concerns,  the  national  security  concerns  are  shared  by  a
lot  of  people  in  our  country,  and  then  there  is  a  third  group  that
you  need  to  identify  with,  and  that  is  the  group  who  believes  that
the  fossil  fuels  just  aren’t  going  to  be  there.  And  that  we  have
known  that  for  28  years  that  we  were  going  to  be  roughly  here
today  with  oil  at  $120  some  a  barrel,  because  38  years  ago  the
United  States  reached  its  maximum  oil  production.  That  was  pre-
dicted in 1956. By 1980, we knew darn well that M. King Hubbert
was  right  about  the  United  States  peaking  in  oil  production  in
1970.

So  now  for  28  years  we  have  done  absolutely  nothing,  and  of
course, you may argue that with global warming, our Earth will be
different,  more  acid  ocean,  our  oceans  will  be  different.  That  may
not be all that bad. They will be different. If I lived in Siberia, you
would  have  a  hard  time  convincing  me  a  warmer  world  would  be
all that bad. And as far as the national security thing is concerned,
the Arabs may play nice and continue to give us the oil.

But  if  it  just  isn’t  there,  it  just  isn’t  there.  And  there  is  increas-
ing  evidence  that  we  have  reached  a  peak  oil  production  in  the
world. It will be plateaued for a little while and then the world will
do  what  the  United  States  has  been  doing  ever  since  1970,  pump-
ing even less and less at higher and higher costs.

If  you  are  concerned  about  rising  ocean  CO2 levels,  and  you
should be, because it may be better and it may be worse, but, gee,
it  is  okay  now,  and  why  should  we  run  the  risk  that  it  might  be
worse  in  the  future,  are  you  reaching  out  to  these  other  groups,
these other two groups, those who are concerned about national se-
curity and those who are concerned that the fossil fuels just aren’t
going  to  be  there?  Because  all  three  of  these  groups  have  common
cause,  and  instead  of  nit-picking  each  other’s  premise,  don’t  you
think we ought to be locking arms and marching together?

Yes, sir.
Dr.  DONEY.  Well,  I  am  sympathetic  with  many  of  your  remarks,
and  I  think  that  we  haven’t  done  enough  to  bridge  across  commu-
nities.

With  regard  to  the  effect  of  the  change  in  the  oceans,  that  it  is
true  that  wherever  there  is  light  and  nutrient,  something  will
grow,  and  so  we  are  not  worried  about  sterilizing  the  oceans  or
anything  like  that.  But  change  is  a  significant  thing,  even  if  the
end  state  might  not  be  completely  terrible.  But  let  us  say  that  we
know  now  that  coral  reefs  are  at  least  threatened,  that  the  levels
of acidification that we are likely to reach haven’t been experienced
for  many  tens  of  millions  of  years,  and  so  there  are  communities
that  have  built  up,  assuming  that  there  would  be  certain  fish
stocks or certain resources available in coral reefs or say the salm-
on industry.

And you know, it might be that the salmon aren’t there and some
other fish might be there. Then there is the question, well, will we
be able to eat that fish? Yes or no? And so there is a risk, and typi-
cally  what  we  are  seeing  is  changes  in  ocean  chemistry  that  are
about  100  times  faster  and  bigger  in  magnitude  than  the  kinds  of
changes that occurred naturally.

And  so,  you  know,  the  expectation  is  that  the  systems  that  are
adapted  to  very  precise  chemical  or  climatological  conditions  will

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:41 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042610 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\060508\42610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

68

disappear  and  be  replaced  by  more  invasive,  generalist  species,
which on land we call weeds.

And so the expectation is to see a loss of diversity and essentially
increased  weediness  of  the  oceans,  and  it  is  true  that  we  will  as
humans  adapt  to  that  and  find  something  to  eat  in  that,  but  that
will be a big dislocation cost and a big loss of diversity.

And  so,  you  know,  and  we  can’t  say  exactly  how  bad  it  will  be,
but  I  think  we  know  that  some  major  systems  will  go.  I  mean,  I
think, just to broaden it out to the climate change, you know, there
is  a  question,  it  looks  now  like  we  are  going  to  lose  Arctic  eco-
systems, and we are going to lose coral reefs, and some people say,
well,  if  that  is  all  it  is,  then  let  us  not  worry  about  it.  But  maybe
that  is  just  the  beginning,  and  we  are  starting  to  lose  major  sys-
tems,  and  we  don’t  know  what  other  major  systems  we  are  going
to lose.

And so to a certain extent it is, what is your level of risk, of irre-
versible  environmental  risks  that  you  are  willing  to  take  on?  And
to  me  a  precautionary  approach  seems  prudent,  and  if  we  know
that  for  a  relatively  minor  investment  we  could  avoid  this  risk,  it
seems  reasonable,  and  there  are  other  risks  that  can  be  avoided
like  national  security  risks  and  risks  to  our  economy  through  loss
of  fossil  fuels.  And  so  the  people,  so  addressing  this  carbon-based
energy  system  and  replacing  it  with  a  system  that  doesn’t  release
greenhouse  gases  to  the  atmosphere  has  multiple  advantages,  and
we need to work more broadly together as you suggest.

Mr. BARTLETT. Mr. Chairman, since I am not a gambler, I would

have to concur with what Dr. Caldeira says. Thank you.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Thank  the  Chairman  and  I  thank  our  outstanding

Now,  when  you  first,  the  first  time  you  ever  go  out  into  an  area
with  a  coral  reef  and  you  are  walking  on  the  surface  of  the  water
and, or, you know, walking on a pier, and you sort of see some col-
ored fish, you think, that is pretty interesting. There is some pretty
fish  down  there.  And  then  you  put  on  a  mask  and  a  snorkel,  and
you  put  your  head  under  water,  and  you  pop  up,  and  you  think,
my God. Have you guys seen what is down here? Do you have any
idea what is down here?

And then you do more diving and things of that sort, and to that,
Dr. Caldeira, because I know from your background that when you
say,  well,  people  might,  don’t  think  it  is  a  big  deal  to  lose  a  coral
reef. It is a huge deal to lose coral reefs. It is unimaginably horrible
if  we  have  done  this  as  a  species  to  this  planet.  Only  people  who
live  on  Earth  solid  terra  firma  but  have  never  stuck  their  head
under  water  with  the  lens  so  they  could  actually  see  something
would  ever  imagine  that  we  are  not  damaging  this  Earth  in  ways
that are unforgivable and inexcusable.

That is why we are working so hard on this. I am not saying you
are  condoning  that  for  sure,  but  I  just  want  to  state  I  sort  of  wish
we  could  take  every  single  Member  of  Congress  and  spend  a  day
at  a  coral  reef.  Just  start  the  session  there.  We  will  fly  down  in

January,  we  will  go  down  to  Florida,  see  a  healthy  reef,  and  we
will say what would happen if we lost it.

Dr. DONEY. You know, when ocean acidification happened 65 mil-
lion years ago, it took two million years for the coral reefs to repop-
ulate  the  coast  of  the  continents,  and  so  what  we  are  doing  over
the  next  years  and  the  next  decades  is  going  to  affect,  you  know,
coral reefs not just for years and decades but for millions of years,
and then so, I mean, to me the idea that we are even talking about
risking these systems is incredible.

And so, you know, what I am saying it is just, we might be lucky

and it is just coral reefs, it is not——

Mr. BAIRD. I mean, we might not lose the entire planet.
Dr. DONEY. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I mean——
Mr.  BAIRD.  Doctor  told  you,  hey,  the  good  news  is  you  are  only

going to lose your liver.

Dr.  DONEY.  Right.  Right.  And  so,  I  mean,  the  real  thing  to  do  is

to reduce CO2——
Mr. BAIRD. Yeah.
Dr. DONEY.—emissions.
Mr. BAIRD. I get the point, and I just want to under-scribe, I sin-
cerely  mean  that.  I  sincerely  mean  this  Congress  could  do  well  to
go  to  these  places.  I  have  had  the  profound  privilege  and  I  went
with  Mr.  Inglis,  of  seeing  the  Great,  the  once  Great  Barrier  Reef,
which is not so great in most of it anymore. I have been to the Uni-
versity  Institute  in  Eilat  and  seen  some  of  the  base  science  being
done on acidification there and the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba.
And I have been to the Aquarius Lab down in Florida, and I want
to especially acknowledge all of those institutes and also the Atlan-
tic  Oceanic  Meteorological  Laboratory,  which  does  phenomenal
work in these areas.

So  I  have  managed  to  see  different  areas  of  reefs  around  the
world,  and  in  all  cases,  every  single  case,  we  are  facing  real
threats.

The  legislative  process  is  an  iterative  process  at  its  best.  We
don’t  have  pride  of  ownership  so  much  as  we  want  to  get  the  job
done right. The legislation we—that is the basis for this hearing is
really  the  basis  for  the  hearing.  It  is  not  necessarily  what  we
should  do.  And  so  what  we  are  really  out  with  the  hearing  is  not
to  ask  for  kudos.  We  don’t  really  care  about  that.  It  is,  really,  let
us do the right thing.

And  so  we  have  heard  some  suggestions.  I  absolutely  share  the
belief  that  the  magnitude  of  the  problem  warrants  a  much  greater
and  more  urgent  investment  financially.  So  we  will  stipulate  to
that.

Secondly, I am interested in this discussion of whether or not an
interagency  organization  is  the  best  or  whether  or  not  targeted
funds, but at the same time how do you coordinate where the funds
best go? And I am interested in that. If we need to modify this bill
or do something completely different, tell us what you think needs
to be done.

And then the third thing I am real interested in is you look, you
know,  you  look  at  the  science  articles,  and  I  have  followed  them
very  closely  over  the  last  few  years.  It  is  great  how  international

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:41 Dec 12, 2008 Jkt 042610 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\060508\42610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

70

this  is.  What,  I  don’t  think  our  bill  does  enough,  frankly,  on  the
international front by a darn sight.

What  are  your  thoughts,  if  you  could,  if  you  were  saying,  write
the  bill  instead  of  us  who  don’t  know  what  the  heck  we  are  doing,
what  would  you  do?  Each  of  you.  What  would  you  do  differently?
And  fire  away.  You  can  say  this  is  a  crappy  bill.  Let  us  throw
it  out  and  get  something  better,  and  I  am  okay  with  that.  Maybe
in more delicate language.

Dr.  FEELY.  I  want  to  answer  a  little  bit  the  question  to  Dr.
Caldeira.  I  just—coral  reef  systems  provide  protein  and  resources
to  at  least  500  (million)  if  not  a  billion  people  on  Earth.  So  they
are a resource we can’t afford to lose. It is a really important issue
that we need to address. That is the first point.

Secondly, I think that the agencies work extremely well together.
They, the program managers work on a daily basis together, so we
are  very  comfortable  working  with  the  federal  agencies  to  have  an
interagency program on this issue.

And  if  the  responsibility  is  given  to  JSOST,  I  am  absolutely  cer-
tain we can work out those details from that point on. I don’t think
that is going to be a major issue, because they are very comfortable
in  doing  that.  And  we  work  with  all  the  program  managers,  so  we
know that quite well. So I think that is the right way to go person-
ally.

The  third  issue  is,  and  something  that  has  not  come  up  yet,  is
that  there  are  some  technological  developments  that  have  to  be
part of this effort. The way we have operated with NOAA is to add
carbon  measurements  on  the  existing  moorings  and  floats  and  in-
strumentation packages that are part of the climate program. They
are part of the National Climate Program, and we do so by adding
them  to  existing  investments,  and  this  is  the  right  way  to  proceed
in the future. This is what allows us to get global coverage, allows
us to get regional coverage in the coastal regime.

But with ocean acidification the problem is different. We have to
develop  the  technologies  to  measure  two  components  of  the  carbon
system, not just one as we are doing now. And so we have to make
an  investment  in  those  technology  development  to  do  that.  This  is
something that needs to be done right away, right now.

And  here  is  where  we  need  help  to  get  that  started,  and  I  think
the  federal  agencies  are  well  poised  to  move  quickly  on  this  issue,
but we need to have the resources to do so.

Dr. KLEYPAS. I would like to make a comment on two things. One
is  just  thanks  for  bringing  up  the  level  of  appreciation  for  coral
reefs. I did my Ph.D. on the Great Barrier Reef myself. Every time
I  go  back  I  have  tears  in  my  eyes,  and  it  is  still  one  of  the  best
reef  systems  we  have,  but  as  you  know  globally  they  are  threat-
ened  not  just  by  ocean  acidification  but  by  coral  bleaching,  which
is  due  to  global  warming.  And  so  they  are  hit,  you  know,  it  is  a
double whammy from CO2 in the atmosphere on coral reefs.

On the international cooperation——
Mr.  BAIRD.  Dr.  Kleypas,  the  way  I  talk  to  people  about  that  is
if you had a 103 degree fever every day for the rest of your life and
to treat it they gave you acid water to drink, you might get a sense
of why this is a problem.

Dr. KLEYPAS. I am going to use that one in the future.

71

Internationally  what  I  think  has  been  remarkable  about  ocean
acidification is there has been a tremendous amount of goodwill be-
tween our international colleagues. So we have invited them to our
workshops,  and  they  have  been  very  helpful  and  very  uncompeti-
tive, very giving in terms of what they know and advice on how we
should design our reef program and vice versa. In fact, three of us
at  least  are  going  to  the  European  Program  on  ocean  acidification
kick-off  meeting  this  coming  week,  and  that  is  invitational.  They
have put us on the board, and this is continuing, and it is growing,
and verbally we are very supportive of each other’s research.

Now, some of the work that Dick has been describing with moor-
ings  and  so  forth,  a  lot  of  that  can  be  expanded  and  really  made
efficient  with  our  own  research,  but  also  on  an  international  basis
by  capitalizing  on  what  they  have  in  terms  of  their  observing  sys-
tem,  sharing  lab  facilities,  but  particularly  these  big,  open  ocean
experiments  that  will  probably  be  very  expensive,  can  really  do
well  by  engaging  them  through  some  sort  of  exchange  program,
some sort of structure for international funding that supports these
kind  of  things.  Maybe  similar  to  the  way  the  ocean  drilling  pro-
gram  is  operated.  I  am  not  exactly  sure  exactly  how  to  do  it,  but
I  think  the  goodwill  is  there,  the  need  is  there,  and  if  we  can  put
something in that bill, I am sure many of us on this panel will help
you write that in the right way.

Dr.  DONEY.  If  I  can  continue,  I  want  to  echo  Dr.  Feely’s  com-
ments.  The  front-line  program  managers  in  the  ocean  agencies
work  very  well  together.  I  work  with  them  on  a  day-to-day  basis.
I  am  Chair  of  the  U.S.  Ocean  Carbon  and  Biogeochemistry  Pro-
gram, which is an NSF, NASA, and NOAA-sponsored research pro-
gram.

One  of  the  things  the  bill  does  do,  and  I  think  is  very  good,  is
it brings at a higher level within the agencies the priority of ocean
acidification.  We  do  have  an  ocean  research  priority  plan  that  is
across  agencies.  This  is  what  JSOST  is  working  off  of.  There  are
four priorities at present, and we have been pushing them to make
ocean acidification the fifth national priority for ocean sciences.

The  only  reason  I  hesitate  in  establishing  a  new  interagency
committee  is  that  we  have  one  in  place  already  for  ocean  sciences.
We  don’t  need  more  bureaucracy.  We  can  take  advantage  of  what
is there right now to coordinate across the agencies.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Well,  if  we  had  JSOST  but  we  directed  them,  for  ex-
ample,  to  make  this  one  of  their  top  five  priorities,  this  is  really
helpful. I appreciate your indulgence, Mr. Chairman. If we were to
say,  make  this  one  of  your  top  five  priorities,  include  an  inter-
national  component,  work  on  the  instrumentation.  We  are  getting
towards a better bill here.

Chairman LAMPSON. Yes.
Mr.  BAIRD.  There  are  others.  Mr.  Chairman,  may  we  hear  from

the others?

Chairman LAMPSON. Yes. Go ahead. This is important.
Mr.  WARREN.  I  don’t  know  that  I  am  really  qualified  to  say  how
the bill should be, nor is that really what we do. I think it is a bet-
ter  point  and  really  to  address  the  question,  what  we  would  like
to see and what we think a lot of the people in the industry would

like  to  see  is  not  specifically  an  issue  with  the  bill.  It  is  about  the
process.

Everybody  knows  it  is  a  tight  budget  time.  We  are  dealing  here
with one of the greatest problems, as has been said, that we know
about, and rather than pulling out some of the legs underneath our
system  for  understanding  what  is  changing  in  the  ocean  in  order
to add a new leg, we ought to keep the ones that are there because
we need them. And figure out how to do this in the best way.

What that way is I think you all are well qualified to figure out.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
Ms. Woolsey, you are recognized.

REDUCING OR REVERSING OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Last  week  or  the  week  before  my  staff  attended  the  Ocean
Science  and  Climate  Change  Summit  in  Monterey,  California,
hosted by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. They re-
ported  back,  and  these  are  two  members  of  my  staff  that  are  so-
phisticated in all of this, and they were actually horrified to report
back  that  acidification  is  the  number  one  concern.  They  knew  it,
but they really heard it loud and clear down there.

So  the  irony  is  that  that  same  week  on  the  business  page  of  al-
most  every  newspaper  there  was  an  article  saying  that  the  three
U.S.  automobile  manufacturers  in  this  country  were  stunned,  they
didn’t use that word, I am using it, that they were going to go out
of business because they weren’t building small, fuel-efficient auto-
mobiles.  Well,  you  know,  this  is,  you  don’t  answer  this  question.
What took them so long?

But the question to you is how long will it take for us to address
acidification, and how long do we have to prevent, reduce, and even
reverse the effects of ocean acidification?

Dr. CALDEIRA. As I said in my prepared testimony, the taxi—the
CO2 from  the  taxi  I  took  yesterday,  some  of  that  is  going  into  the
ocean already. And so the good side of that would be if I, you know,
had had an electric car to drive here, then that would be CO2 that
would not be going into the ocean today.

And  so  the  surface  ocean  feels  our  CO2 emissions  or  our  reduc-
tions  in  CO2 emissions  right  away,  and  if  we  would  stop  emitting
CO2 today, the oceans would start getting better right away.

On the other hand, there is a lot of inertia in our energy system,
in  that  power  plants  are  typically  the  last  60  or  more  years  when
you  build  them,  and  so  if  you  build  a  new  power  plant  that  emits
CO2 into the atmosphere, that will damage the ocean for many dec-
ades  and  millennia  to  come.  And  so  while  coral  reefs  will  say  still
have water that they can grow well in for a few decades, if we build
those  power  plants  today,  they  won’t.  And  so  it  is  really  essential
to  have  action  today  if  we  want  to  have  healthy  oceans  in  the  fu-
ture.

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Well,  I  admit  it  isn’t  just  action  from  the  United

States. It is action globally.

Dr. CALDEIRA. Yes.
Ms.  WOOLSEY.  I  was  part  of  a  China  discussion  this  morning  at
breakfast.  We  have  a  huge  role  to  play  in  the  international  global
warming situation.

Dr.  CALDEIRA.  We  need  global  action,  but  we  need  American

leadership.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Absolutely.
Anybody else want to respond?
Dr. KLEYPAS. I just want to make one point that sometimes gets
lost, and that is the response of the surface ocean. That is the shal-
low part of the ocean where most of marine life lives. We know that
once carbon gets in the ocean that it will stay there for a long time
because  of  the  ocean  conveyor  belt  bringing  that  carbon  to  deeper
depths where it get stored for hundreds to thousands of years.

But that surface ocean is very responsive to the atmospheric CO2
concentration or carbon dioxide concentration. So if, you know, just
in  an  optimistic  view,  just  to  put  this  out  there,  and  I  know  a  lot
of people will say this is impossible, but with new technology some
of  the  stuff  that  Representative  Inslee  was  mentioning,  and  Amer-
ican ingenuity, if we can find ways to remove CO2 from the atmos-
phere,  that  surface  ocean  will  start  responding  immediately  and
the ocean acidification will be reduced immediately as long as CO2
goes back down.

If we could do that, that would be a really remarkable thing, and

I think it is a nice star to put up there to aim for.

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  just  like  to  brag  a
little bit about my district. My district is Marin and Sonoma Coun-
ties,  and  we  have  two  national  marine  sanctuaries.  We  have  the
Gulf  of  the  Farallones  and  the  Cordell  Banks  National  Marine
Sanctuaries, and I have legislation that will double, more than dou-
ble  the  size  of  that  sanctuary  and  reach  up  the  entire  coast  of
Sonoma  County  into  the  southern  part  of  Mendocino  County.  And
we  have  gotten  that  legislation  through  the  House  of  Representa-
tives. It is out of the Commerce Committee and the Senate, and we
are hoping it is going to be part of an omnibus bill coming through
the Senate Floor.

So it is, you know, not, we are not going to rob Peter to pay Paul,

but we have the many legs that we have to deal with.

Dr.  CALDEIRA.  I  think  it  is  important  not  to,  you  know,  while
ocean  acidification  is  a  very  important  issue,  it  is  an  additional
stress  on  marine  systems,  and  the  better  we  can  manage  our  fish-
eries  or  reduce  coastal  pollution  or  in  other  ways  take  care  of  our
marine  environment,  then  the  better,  the  more  likely  that  these
ecosystems can meet the challenges posed by ocean acidification.

Ms. WOOLSEY. And if we prevent drilling for oil off of our coasts,

we will prevent CO2 in the atmosphere, I believe.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Just  out  of  curiosity,  Ms.  Woolsey,  how

many fifth graders visit that facility each year?

Ms. WOOLSEY. Well, it isn’t a facility. It is like a whole coast, and
they  have  hundreds  and  thousands  of  them.  It  is  40  minutes  from
San Francisco. You can imagine.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Dr.  Baird  and  I  were  talking  quietly  here,
as  you  all  were  going  on,  about  perhaps  us  considering  a  require-
ment  that  every  fifth  grader  in  the  world  if  possible,  but  at  least
in  the  United  States,  have  a  course  that  would  teach  so  that  we
can begin now to make sure that the next generation, obviously not
enough of our generations——

Ms. WOOLSEY. Right.
Chairman  LAMPSON.—understand  these  problems.  There  are  a
handful of us who are talking, in comparison to the full population.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Right.
Chairman LAMPSON. Are you all doing anything to really get the
word out to those who are writing school curricula at the very early
level?

Ms. WOOLSEY. Well, before you say that, Mr. Chairman, I would

like to respond.

I  have  a  grandson  who  is  in  the  second  grade,  and  my  grand-
children call me Alma, and we were at dinner the other night, and
he said, Alma, have you heard about the polar bears? I mean, and
he really was concerned. So, but that is Sonoma County, you know.
Maybe, we are talking about the rest of the world. Right?

Chairman LAMPSON. Well, I hope that it spreads——
Ms. WOOLSEY. Okay. Ask the question.
Chairman  LAMPSON.—because  if  it  doesn’t,  then  obviously  we

Dr. Baird, I understand you have more questions. You are recog-

have heard the risks.

nized for five minutes.

AN INTERNATIONAL PANEL ON OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

Mr. BAIRD. I could go on for a long time with this panel and with
some of the others in the audience here, and so this is a continuing
process  but  a  few  other  things  I  just  want  to  make  sure  I  under-
stand.

We  have  had  testimony  in  this  committee,  particularly  from  the
IPCC.  What  attention  is  IPCC  giving  to  acidification  is  one  part,
and do we need a comparable, I won’t call it the acronym here, but
ocean  acidification,  international  panel  of  ocean  acidification?  Do
we need or does such a thing exist?

Dr.  DONEY.  The  fourth  assessment  for  the  IPCC  had  a  fairly
small discussion on ocean acidification, and I think that in part re-
flected,  IPCC  depends  upon  the  published  scientific  literature,  and
this  is  a  very  fast-moving  and  fast-evolving  field.  So  there  really
wasn’t the literature base three or four years ago when they start-
ed that.

I do think in the future that there will be a much more substan-
tial  component  within  IPCC  addressing  ocean  acidification,  and  in
fact,  I  was  just  at  a  meeting  yesterday  with  federal  agency  man-
agers where we were trying to think about what would be the best
way to put the right syntheses in the literature that can reach that
step.

But  I  think  the  other  thing  is  this  is,  you  know,  IPCC  sort  of
looks  at  the  global  problem,  but  for  resource  managers  and  stake-
holders  this  is  a  local  issue,  and  I  think  one  of  the  things  that  we
need  to  do  with  this  research  program  is  bring  this  down  to  the
scale of individual states, individual fishery council levels and that,
the  level  of  individual  fishers  and  people  who  are  using  the  ocean.
So  I  think  we  need  to  bring  it  into  the  global  assessment  level,
but we really need to bring it home to a much smaller scale to see
how it is actually going to affect human lives and our economic sys-
tem.

Dr. CALDEIRA. The IPCC is a product of the UN Framework Con-
vention  on  Climate  Change,  and  ocean  acidification  is  really  a
chemical change and not a climate change. And so the IPCC hasn’t
really felt that it was directly within its remit. But I do think rath-
er  than  creating  a  new  parallel  organization  it  would  be  good  if
governments would make it clear to the IPCC that they would like
ocean  acidification  considered  to  be  within  the  remit  of  the  IPCC
and  broaden  the  understanding  that  it  is  not  just  climate  change
but also chemical change.

Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Warren, I found that the National Shellfish Cau-
cus and folks you alluded to earlier are interested in this issue, and
one of the interesting things is to what extent do the fisheries, does
the  fisheries  industry  proactively  take  an  active  voice  or  should
they proactively take a more active voice in issues of ocean acidifi-
cation  and  carbon  production  and  change  in  our  energy  supply,  et
cetera, because it is directly impacting the industry. What role are
they playing in that?

Mr. WARREN. It is an emerging role. I think we will see it expand
inevitably with time. I go around and give talks to people in fishing
communities  and  in  the  industry  all  the  time,  and  what  I  find  is
that they have moved rapidly, faster than other groups, into under-
standing  the  issue  and  knowing  what  is  at  stake.  There  is  still  a
lot of education to do in the community.

Some of them are already ready to wave their swords in the air.
Some are wanting to take a very circumspect approach. They have
complex  economic  interests,  and  they  have  to  be  careful  in  how
they address this. And that is perfectly valid.

That  they  will  address  it  I  am  confident.  How—is,  for  most  of

them, still being worked out.

ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT

Mr.  BAIRD.  We  have  a  number  of  skeptics  in  the  Congress  and
on  this  committee  about  the  issue  of  climate  change  and  whether
or not there is any change in temperature, and if so, the degree to
which  it  is  human  caused,  and  I  think  as  a  Science  Committee  it
is healthy to have skeptics here. I disagree with how they interpret
the evidence sometimes.

There  are  also  some  skeptics  about  the  issue  of  ocean  acidifica-
tion,  particularly  the  decline  in  carbonate  levels.  And  at  least  one
gentleman I have spoken to has suggested it is a result of changing
wind  patterns  on  the  Gobi  Desert  not  blowing  minerals  into  the
oceans. Is there any substance to that that any of you know of?

Dr.  DONEY.  Actually,  Dr.  Feely  and  I  have  done  some  work  on
looking at the atmospheric transport of trace gas species and dust.
The limited data that is available from rain measurements actually
suggest  that  the  amount  of  base,  the  calcium  carbonate  which
would  neutralize  the  ocean,  has  actually  gone  up,  and  yet  we  still
see the ocean being acidified.

So  I  don’t  think  that  hypothesis  holds  weight.  It  is  something
that  we  have  worked  a  lot  on  looking  at  dust  distributions,  and
that doesn’t appear to be a plausible mechanism.

Dr. FEELY. I just want to add is from the ocean carbon observing
system  throughout  the  world,  our  own  time  series  stations  at  hot
off of Hawaii and back off of Bermuda, my own work over the last

76

30  years,  we  have  actually  measured  the  changes  in  CO2 con-
centrations,  increase  in  CO2 in  the  surface  waters,  and  the  de-
crease in pH throughout the world oceans.

And so there is no doubt where this coming from.
Dr.  CALDEIRA.  Scott  and  I  both  run  fancy  models  to  predict  sur-
face  ocean  chemistry  changes,  but  really,  you  don’t  need  them.  If
you  just  took  a  bucket  of  water,  stuck  it  under  a  bell  jar,  changed
the  CO2 concentration,  you  could  measure  the  change  in  pH  and
measure  the  change  in  carbonate  ion  concentration,  and  if  you
would  stick  a  coral  head  in  there,  you  would  measure  that  its
growth rate declines.

And  so,  you  know,  there  is  no,  you  can  demonstrate  this  easily
in  a  high  school  laboratory.  You  don’t  need  the  fancy  things  to  see
that this is right.

MORE ON OCEAN ACIDIFICATION MONITORING

Mr.  BAIRD.  I  should  also  acknowledge,  I  see  my  good  friend,  Mr.
Diaz-Balart here. He has actually dived to the Aquarius Lab. That
is something we hope to do together somewhere down the road, and
of  course,  AOML  is  very  closely  related  to  Aquarius  and  the  great
work  down  there.  And  we  will  go  diving  down  there  together,  Mr.
Diaz-Balart.

One  of  the  things  I  saw  at  AOML,  it  was  very  interesting,  was
a Power Point, which maybe we should have done here. This would
be  very  interesting,  Mr.  Chairman,  about,  I  think  it  actually  not
just,  it  was  real  time  log-on,  it  was,  in  fact,  log-on  monitoring  to
the monitoring stations where, not the stations, the floats that are
distributed  throughout  the  world,  an  entire  global  network  of
floats, some maintained by commercial shipping routes, where they
drop floats off at periodic things, and they get remote sensing.

It  would  be  very  interesting  for  this  committee  to  see  that.  Dr.
Feely, you talked about instrumentation. Is that the kind of system
where you would want to see CO2 monitors giving up intel on real
time?

Dr. FEELY. That is exactly what I have in mind. I am a colleague
of Dr. Winacoff, who carries out those measurements. I do it in the
Pacific,  and  he  does  it  in  the  Atlantic.  What  we  have  is  a  series
of  moorings  throughout  the  world  that  we  are  adding  carbon  sys-
tem  monitoring  instrumentations  on  the  moorings.  We  couple  that
with  CO2 instrumentation  on  ships  of  opportunity.  These  are  usu-
ally  cargo  ships  throughout  the  world,  and  we  hope  to  have  CO2
instrumentation on Argo floats and gliders and things like this.

The  problem  we  have  right  now  is  we  only  have  one  carbon
measurement,  that  is  PCO2 at  the  moment.  This  is  something  we
know  how  to  do  quite  well.  In  order  to  study  ocean  acidification,
we  need  two.  We  need  PCO2 measurement  and  dissolved  organic
or  alglini,  one  of  those  two  species  we  prefer  to  do  that.  That  is  a
technology we have to develop.

In  our  scientific  community  those  technologies  are  quickly  being
developed,  but  we  have  to  implement  them  onto  the  moorings  and
floats and ships, and that takes some effort to do the testing to do
that. That is something we have to do right now.

Mr. BAIRD. We should push for that in some way to give us much

more information.

Dr. FEELY. Absolutely. So one of our recommendations is to point
out very clearly that we need the development of the carbon meas-
urements  in  this  bill,  and  the  carbon  measurements  are  what  is
causing this problem.

Dr.  CALDEIRA.  One  of  the  reasons  this  research  is  expensive  is
because ships are expensive, and the more you can invest in devel-
oping measurement tools that can be put out on unmanned drifters
or  gliders,  the  more  you  can  reduce  the  long-term  costs  of  this  re-
search effort.

Mr.  BAIRD.  I  don’t  have,  I  have  thousands  of  further  questions.

In the interest of the panel I won’t ask them here.

I  want  to  also,  if  I  may,  just  personally,  I  know  there  are  other
experts  in  the  audience  here  who  have  a  lot  of  expertise  on  this.
I  personally  would  welcome  if  anyone  wants  to,  in  addition  to  the
panel, wants to direct suggestions to us about ways that this legis-
lation or some legislation could be improved, what we ought to do,
because I want to move on this post haste, and I am very grateful,
Mr. Chairman, for your leadership and for our colleagues.

Thanks again to the witnesses.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Baird.
It is a fascinating discussion, and obviously there is an awful lot
of  work  that  has  to  be  done,  and  it  would  be  great  when  we  can
start  hooking  up  any  other  sources  of  information  and  see  how  so
many other things are related.

We  have  got  a  lot  to  learn,  and  just  this,  as  Dr.  Baird  was  just
saying,  we  have  got  to  rely  on  you  experts.  Maybe  we  know  how
to get something through the governmental process sometimes, but
without  the  knowledge  that  you  give  to  us  we  don’t  know  what  to
put  in  those  bills  and  in  that  language.  So  think  about  it  and  we
would  always  welcome  the  opportunity  to  have  your  input.  We  to-
gether  are  in  this  boat.  It  is  not  us.  We  are  not  the  leaders.  You
all are the leaders. We are the followers. We will do our best to fol-
low what you are trying to tell us.

So  I  thank  all  of  you  for  appearing  today  at  this  hearing.  And
under  the  rules  of  the  Committee  the  record  will  be  held  open  for
two  weeks  for  Members  to  submit  additional  statements  and  any
additional questions that they might have for the witnesses.

This hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:47 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
