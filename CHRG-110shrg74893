THE  FUTURE  OF  THE  INTERNET 

TUESDAY,  APRIL  22,  2008 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:06  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Daniel  K.  Inouye, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

The  CHAIRMAN.  The  Internet  is  one  of  the  great  success  stories 
of  the  20th  century.  It  has  been  a  key  factor  in  the  ability  of  the 
United  States  to  steadily  improve  worker  productivity  for  the  past 
15  years.  Our  economy  and  the  quality  of  our  lives  have  evolved 
significantly because of this network of networks. 

The Internet has created an era of transparency, making it even 
harder for the corporations and governments to escape scrutiny for 
actions that do not stand up to the light of day. Again, I would sug-
gest that, because of this expanded flow of information, our Nation 
is much stronger. 

The Internet has also brought together communities of like-mind-
ed  individuals  who  share  an  interest  in  a  hobby,  in  a  unique  cul-
ture,  or  in  saving  a  few  dollars  when  shopping  for  their  families. 
In  a  country  that  is  defined  by  its  very  diversity,  I  would  suggest 
that this capacity to bring people together serves us well. 

Along  with  the  great  benefits,  the  Internet,  unfortunately,  has 
provided a new avenue for those who would seek to take advantage 
of  the  fellow  citizens.  Identity  theft,  violations  of  intellectual  prop-
erty rights, and any number of good old-fashioned scams have been 
updated  to  the  Digital  Age,  and  we  continue  to  struggle  with  the 
best way to protect our children from inappropriate content and in-
appropriate contact with those who would do them harm. 

Along  with  the  problems  facing  individual  Americans  as  they 
navigate  the  digital  world,  there  are  also  challenges  facing  those 
who  provide  services  and  contact  via  the  Internet  and  those  who 
build and manage the network infrastructure necessary for the con-
tinued expansion and improvement of the Internet. 

I believe that the government has a responsibility to create a reg-
ulatory  environment  that  will  1  day  enable  each  and  every  Amer-
ican to have affordable access to reliable broadband service. 

To  achieve  this  long-term  goal,  I’ve  introduced  the  Broadband 
Data  Improvement  Act.  This  act  is  designed  to  give  us  a  starting 
point. It will better define what ‘‘broadband’’ is, and it will provide

2 

us  with  accurate  information  on  the  current  status  of  broadband 
deployment  in  the  United  States.  This  information  is  essential  to-
ward universal broadband deployment. 

Another significant responsibility of our government is to ensure 
that  the  Internet  continues  to  grow  and  thrive.  The  issue  of  net-
work  neutrality  and  its  offspring,  nondiscrimination  and  network 
management, looms large in this debate. The central question here 
seems  to  be  how  to  best  balance  the  right  of  the  American  people 
to  uncensored  and  unfettered  access  to  Internet  content  and  serv-
ices  against  the  desire  of  the  Internet  service  providers  to  manage 
their networks in an efficient, profitable way. 

For  several  years  now,  policy  discussions  on  this  subject  have 
been  waged  on  a  rhetorical  battlefield.  We  are  told  that  nothing 
less  than  the  future  of  the  Internet  is  at  stake.  Yet,  even  in  this 
winner-take-all  environment,  we  see  the  inklings  of  progress,  the 
dialogue  between  cable  and  peer-to-peer  services,  the  novel  open- 
access  requirements  on  the  C-block  spectrum,  and  the  swift  re-
sponse  of  a  wireless  provider  to  a  text-messenging  snafu  that 
thwarted political speech. 

It  may  be  early  for  optimism,  but  progress  deserves  praise.  In 
the  meantime,  I  can  assure  you  that  this  committee  will  continue 
to  vigorously  exercise  its  oversight  authority  over  this  important 
issue. 

And  may  I  now  recognize  the  Vice  Chairman  of  the  Committee, 

Senator Stevens. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  since  I  came  in  late,  I’ll  yield  to  my 

friends and come back later. OK? 

The CHAIRMAN. Then, may I call upon Senator Dorgan? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  very  much.  First  of 

all, thanks for holding this hearing. 

As  you  know,  Senator  Snowe  and  I  have  introduced  a  piece  of 
legislation,  the  Internet  Freedom  Act.  And  I  want  to  mention,  at 
the  start  of  this  hearing,  that  the  creation  and  the  development  of 
the  Internet  is  a  remarkable  thing  in  our  lives,  and  it  occurred 
under  rules  of  nondiscrimination.  It  is  an  open  architecture.  The 
Internet  has  been  completely  open  in  its  architecture.  Anyone  can 
go  anywhere,  anytime,  under  any  circumstances,  no  gatekeepers, 
no  tollbooths.  And  you  also  know,  and  we  know,  that  there  are 
those  who  have  said,  as  this  Internet  has  developed,  that  they 
would  like  to  find  ways  to  create  tolls.  And  I’ve  often  quoted 
AT&T’s  old  CEO,  Ed  Whitacre,  who  told  Business  Week,  quote, 
‘‘They  don’t  have  any  fiber  out  there,  they  don’t  have  any  wires, 
they  don’t  have  anything.  They  use  my  lines  for  free,  and  that’s 
bull.’’  Well,  he  is  suggesting,  there,  as  others  have,  that  they  will 
want to at some point, as providers, begin finding other streams of 
revenue,  and  doing  that  by  establishing  various  tiers  and  so  on, 
and  they  can  do  that  if  there  are  not  rules  against  discrimination. 
My  feeling  is  that  innovation  in  the  Internet  will  be  stifled  dra-
matically—innovation  in  our  country  will  be  stifled—unless  we  re-
store the nondiscrimination rules.

Mr.  Martin  will  testify  today—the  Chairman  of  the  FCC—that 
the  four  principles  they  have  are  principles  he  believes  probably 
reaches  something  close  to  nondiscrimination.  It’s  very  interesting 
that  we  were  told  previously  in  these  discussions  that  we  didn’t 
need  to  restore  nondiscrimination  rules  because  the  FCC  would  be 
able to resolve this. Now, in a filing to the FCC, one of the largest 
providers in the country alleges the FCC does not have the author-
ity. So, I think that, in itself, raises the question of, Why on earth 
should  Congress  not  act  to  restore  the  nondiscrimination  rules 
under  which  the  Internet  was  created  in  the  first  instance?  That 
is  the  purpose  of  the  piece  of  legislation  that  I  and  Senator  Snowe 
have introduced. 

I  know  this  is  a  controversial  issue,  but  it  certainly  should  not 
be.  When  should  it  be  controversial  to  decide  that  there  shall  be 
nondiscrimination? I mean, those that oppose this apparently have 
to  be  taking  the  side,  ‘‘We  want  to  permit  discrimination,  in  one 
form  or  another.’’  That’s  a  preposterous  position,  in  my  judgment. 
My  hope  is  that  this  hearing  will  give  us  additional  information 
with which to evaluate this issue and then pass our legislation. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
Senator Sununu? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 

Senator SUNUNU. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
I’m  obviously  looking  forward  to  the  testimony  of  the  witnesses. 
I agree with many of the previous statements, certainly one that— 
the  one  that  the  Internet’s  a  remarkable  thing.  I  think  we  can  all 
agree  with  that.  But,  I  find  the  title  of  the  hearing,  ‘‘The  Future 
of the Internet,’’ at least somewhat interesting, in that if the Inter-
net’s  taught  us  anything,  it’s  that  it’s  pretty  presumptuous  to  pre-
dict  what  its  future  will  be.  And  we  don’t  have  to  look  much  fur-
ther than the ground that’s littered with, sort of, the corpses of dot- 
com  businesses,  2001,  2002,  2003,  and,  from  that,  competitive  de-
struction.  We’ve  seen  a  lot  of  growth  and  innovation  in  Internet- 
based  services,  content  distribution,  greater  and  greater  deploy-
ment  of  fiber  and  methodology,  wireless  systems  for  distributing 
and  providing  customers  with  access  to  broadband.  But,  even  so, 
this  is  an  industry  and  a  technology,  an  infrastructure  that  is  in 
its  infancy,  and  we  should  be  very,  very  cautious  about  imposing 
regulations  based  on  what  we  think  competitors  will  do  in  the  fu-
ture  and  how  we  think  consumers  will  respond  when  competitors 
do  things  that  we  think  they  might  do.  That  is  not  the  basis  for 
sound regulation. 

If  there  are  anticompetitive  practices  that  we  can  identify,  we 
should  act.  And  we  already  have  a  lot  of  statutes  in  existing  law 
to deal with anticompetitive practices. If people aren’t properly dis-
closing  the  way  they  operate  and  what  they’re  doing  to  content, 
blocking  access  to  Websites  without  disclosing  that,  I  don’t  think 
we  should  do  that  in  any  case,  but  if  people  are  acting  in  a  way 
that  misleads  consumers,  we  should  act.  And  we  have  the  power 
to act. 

But,  writing  regulations  based  on  how  we  think  competitors 
might behave and how we predict customers might act and respond 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:29 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 074893 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\GPO\DOCS\74893.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

4 

to  that  behavior  is  dangerous,  indeed,  because  what  we  risk  doing 
is  enacting  regulations  that  guarantee  that  the  Internet  will  al-
ways look like what it used to look like, and I don’t want the Inter-
net  to  be  locked  in  to  2008  or  2005  or  2001  or  1996,  when  we— 
when  others  wrote  the  Telecom  Act  that  set  the  groundwork  for  a 
lot  of  what  we’re  doing  today.  We  need  to  let  people  innovate,  let 
people  invest,  be  on  guard  for  practices  that  deny  consumers  ac-
cess,  that  deny  consumers  benefit,  that  stifle  innovation.  But,  we 
shouldn’t  base  regulation  on  the  predictions  of  politicians,  cer-
tainly,  or  even  those  in  industry,  necessarily,  because  we’ve  seen, 
time  and  time  again,  that  some  of  those  that  we  determine  to  be 
the  most  brilliant  in  industry  today  turn  out  to  be  foolish  in  their 
investments in their prediction of where technology is headed. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
Senator Kerry? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS 

Senator  KERRY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  thank  you  for 

holding this hearing on this really important issue. 

And I want to thank Chairman Martin for coming aboard, at the 
last moment here, to join us, which I think is really important, and 
we appreciate it. 

And we also appreciate all of the other witnesses who have trav-
eled  to  Washington  in  order  to  share  thoughts  with  us  on  this 
today. 

This  is  an  issue  on  which  there  have  been  a  lot  of  words  ex-
pended,  a  lot  of  platitudes  and  politics,  and  I  suppose  it’s  almost 
cliche  now,  Mr.  Chairman,  to  say  that,  you  know,  the  Internet  is 
the  future.  I  listened  to  my  colleague  from  New  Hampshire,  just 
now,  talking  about,  you  know,  how  we  shouldn’t  get  in  the  way  of 
this competition, et cetera. But, in recent years, frankly, policy has 
received too little attention. 

And,  you  know,  all  of  us  do  know  how  extraordinary  the  story 
of  the  Internet  is,  the  capacity  it  has  to  foster  innovation,  to  serve 
as  a  forum  for  unfettered  social  and  political  discourse,  and  to 
allow for an extraordinary dissemination of information and knowl-
edge in the country. But, frankly, you know, anyone still wondering 
whether  our  long-term  and  national  investment  in  basic  science 
and  technology,  which  we  talk  about  a  lot  in  this  Committee,  is 
worth  it,  gets  their  answer  every  single  day  when  they  simply  log 
in to check their e-mail and really take for granted something that 
began  nearly  40  years  ago  as  a  DARPA  experiment.  And  those  of 
us  sitting  on  this  Committee  when  we  wrote  the  1996  Tele-
communications  Act  will  all  remember  that  we  were  way  behind 
the  curve,  in  the  sense  that  the  entire  discussion  here  was  about 
telephony, not data, and within 6 months, almost, that Act was by-
passed. But as the Internet, through its own freedom, its own abil-
ity  to  innovate,  through  the  open  architecture  and  the  platform 
that has allowed this extraordinary innovation, as it has grown and 
become  pervasive  in  our  lives,  the  fact  is  that  the  debate  over  the 
need to ensure some very basic principles—principles, not nit-pick-
ing, you know, regulatory structure, but basic principles about how

5 

and when network providers can manage content is becoming more 
and more politicized and polarized. 

During  the  last  go-around  on  this  issue,  in  2006,  we  were  told 
by  the  major  cable  and  phone  companies  that  net  neutrality  was, 
quote,  ‘‘a  solution  in  search  of  a  problem,  a  response  to  blocking 
and  interference  with  Internet  content  which  no  network  operator 
would ever attempt.’’ That’s what we were told. 

I  listened  to  my  colleague  from  New  Hampshire,  just  now,  tell 
us,  you  know,  ‘‘Don’t  get  in  the  way  of  something  that  isn’t  hap-
pening or that might change the things that we can’t predict.’’ But, 
it’s not a question of changing something we can’t predict; it’s hap-
pened. It has happened. 

On  the  heels  of  this  claim,  before  this  Committee,  we  found  out 
that  AT&T  censored  politically  charged  words  during  a  live  broad-
cast  of  Pearl  Jam  concert  in  August  2007.  A  month  later,  Verizon 
rejected  a  request  made  by  NARAL  to  use  the  network  for  text- 
messaging  political  content.  And,  finally,  in  October  of  2007, 
Comcast admitted—and you have to sort of look at the sequence of 
their statements. You know, it’s interesting, if you follow them, be-
cause ultimately what they told us again they weren’t doing, it was 
proven  they  were  doing.  And  they  admitted  to  interfering  with  a 
subscriber’s  attempts  to  share  files  online  using  BitTorrent  tech-
nology. 

So, to whatever degree people were alleging, Mr. Chairman, that 
this was a solution in search of a problem, it has found its problem. 
And  we  have  an  obligation  to  try  to  guarantee  that  the  same  free-
dom and the same creativity that was able to bring us to where we 
are today continues as we forward. 

Now,  even  though  I  want  to  acknowledge,  the  companies  that 
I’ve  just  mentioned  appropriately  took  steps  to  address  each  of 
these  issues.  And  we  applaud  that,  ad  we  appreciate  their  re-
sponse.  But,  we  can’t  expect,  nor  should  the  American  people,  the 
users  of  this  incredible  technology,  expect  that  we  have  to  rely  on 
a  discretionary  and  occasional  political  pressure  or  scrutiny  from 
Congress, or from the FCC, or a vocal and organized group of advo-
cates,  in  order  to  regulate  the  industry.  That  ought  to  happen  be-
cause  we  have  a  set  of  standards  and  expectations  in  place.  And 
I  think  Senator  Dorgan’s  bill,  which  I’m  a  cosponsor  of,  is  the  ap-
proach that makes sense. 

I  also  appreciate  that  the  FCC  is  looking  closely  at  this  issue, 
held hearings in Cambridge and last week, in Palo Alto. And I hope 
that  they’re  going  to  see  fit  to  act  in  a  way  that  will  protect  these 
open networks. 

The  cable  companies  and  the  phone  companies,  Mr.  Chairman, 
tell us that, because of capacity restraints, there’s a need for some 
level of reasonable network management. And there is an aspect to 
this  claim  that  can  ring  true  on  the  surface,  but  I  think  that  is 
something of a cautionary claim, and we ought to put it to the test 
today,  and  take  notice  that  you  can  establish  a  set  of  principles 
that don’t violate that ability. 

One other point I’d like to make, Mr. Chairman. Despite the fact 
that the Internet was born in this country, and this Committee has 
presided  over  its  growth,  America  has  been  in  a  precipitous  free- 
fall  when  it  comes  to  our  global  broadband  ranking.  And  this  is

just—it’s  not  only  disgraceful  and  unacceptable,  it’s  just—it  defies 
any kind of rational approach to the economy that we have in this 
country, and want to have in the future. 

The  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development 
has  dropped  the  United  States  from  fourth  to  fifteenth  in 
broadband  rankings  of  industrialized  nations.  The  International 
Telecommunications Union ranks the United States 21st, tied with 
Estonia,  in  its  digital  opportunity  index.  The  debate  over  net  neu-
trality  and  America’s  global  broadband  ranking  are  linked,  and  I 
think it’s important that we discuss the link. 

When we talk about reasonable network management, we’re also 
talking about the concept of scarcity. We lack the infrastructure to 
deliver  highspeed  broadband  to  every  household,  and  the  public’s 
demand for content, such as video streaming, is exceeding the abil-
ity to deliver it. 

More  than  3  years  ago,  4  years  ago  now,  actually,  the  President 
told us this country needed, and would have, a broadband strategy, 
a  plan,  by  2007.  Well,  it’s  2008,  and  we  are  legitimate  in  asking 
the  question,  Where  is  the  plan?  Where  is  the  sense  of  urgency? 
Entire  swaths  of  our  country,  including  most  of  the  western  part 
of  Massachusetts,  have  little  or  no  access  to  broadband,  and  we’re 
placing  our  businesses  and  workers  at  a  huge  economic  disadvan-
tage every day because of this, Mr. Chairman. 

So, I hope we’re going to start implementing the large-scale pub-
lic investment for broadband, the incentives that we need to put in 
place, so that we can have universal broadband in America, and we 
need  to  pass  legislation,  like  your  Broadband  Data  Improvement 
Act,  so  we  can  get  the  kind  of  accurate  data  we  need  to  know  ex-
actly what we’re up against. I hope our witnesses this morning will 
share  with  us  thoughts  about  that  linkage  and  its  importance  as 
we proceed forward. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN ENSIGN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA 

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Vice-Chairman  Stevens  for  calling  this  hearing 
today  on  an  issue  that  is  very  important  to  me,  the  future  of  the  Internet.  As  you 
know,  the  Internet  has  become  an  indispensable  part  of  our  economy  and  an  inte-
gral part of our society. It is a source of innovation, information, entertainment, new 
wealth,  and  communication.  Every  American’s  life  has  somehow  been  touched  and 
made better by the Internet in some way, and it only becomes more ubiquitous and 
vital as it matures. 

Largely  unfettered  by  government  laws  and  regulations,  the  Internet  owes  much 
of  its  success  to  innovators  and  entrepreneurs  having  the  freedom  to  imagine,  ex-
plore,  and  create  new  uses  for  the  Internet.  This  openness  has  flourished  without

the heavy hand of government intervention, although the continued preservation of 
the  Internet’s  openness  is  at  the  core  of  the  network  neutrality  debate.  Perhaps  no 
issue is more contested or more central to the Internet’s future than this one. 

I  continue  to  believe  that  the  competitive  market  will  be  the  best  steward  of  the 
Internet’s famed openness, as it has been since the Internet was first opened to the 
public.  Businesses  must  be  able  to  freely  determine  how  best  to  provide  their  con-
tent  or  services  to  users.  Internet  service  providers  must  be  allowed  to  reasonably 
manage  their  networks  to  ensure  the  best  possible  experience  for  users.  We  must 
avoid  burdensome  government  regulations  that  micro-manage  network  operators  or 
that  limit  the  ability  of  companies  to  provide  what  their  customers  want  and  need. 
Such  intervention  could  stifle  the  dynamic  marketplace  that  has  given  us  fiber-to- 
the-home  networks,  search  engines  putting  the  information  of  the  world  at  our  fin-
gertips, wireless broadband devices, and streaming on-demand high definition video. 
Even  so,  government  does  have  a  significant  role  to  play  in  guiding  the  future  of 
the Internet. Most observers agree that if there was more competition for broadband 
access  the  network  neutrality  issue  would  be  rendered  all  but  moot.  Rather  than 
imposing  new  government  mandates  that  could  reduce  the  private  sector’s  invest-
ment in our Nation’s broadband infrastructure, Congress should work with industry 
to find ways to encourage increased capital investment and to promote the entry of 
new Internet providers. 

A related problem facing network operators is that of increased congestion, driven 
in  large  part  by  the  transmission  of  pirated  content.  Government  must  work  with 
interested stakeholders to determine what network management activities are prac-
tical,  fair,  and  in  the  public  interest.  Congress’  ability  to  focus  attention  and  shine 
sunlight on these issues, like this hearing will do today, will be one of our most ef-
fective tools to foster such cooperation. 

Restrictive government mandates and meddlesome regulations are not the answer 
to  the  challenges  facing  the  Internet  today.  Indeed,  such  responses  may  serve  to 
smother  creative  new  uses  for  the  Internet  and  to  slow  the  expansion  of  advanced 
broadband networks. The FCC has adopted a set of broadband policies that seek to 
preserve openness, protect against harmful discrimination, and promote innovation. 
In  conjunction  with  these  worthwhile  principles,  Congress  should  also  work  to  en-
sure  that  Internet  companies  can  profit  from  their  endeavors,  protect  their  invest-
ments,  and  provide  better  and  more  responsive  services.  I  believe  these  are  goals 
on  which  we  can  all  agree,  and  we  must  not  let  partisan  politics  distract  us  from 
the task at hand. 

Thank  you  again,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  holding  this  hearing  today.  I  look  forward 

to the testimony of our distinguished panel of witnesses. 

Senator ENSIGN. One of the things that we see around this place, 
one  of  the  worst  laws  that  I  think  that  we  ever  pass,  is  the  law 
of  unintended  consequences.  We  set  out  trying  to  do  the  right 
thing,  but  we  end  up  with  severe  consequences  of  things  that  we 
never foresaw. 

It  is  my  fear  of  regulating  the  Internet  that  this  law  of  unin-
tended  consequences  will  come  up  to  bite  us  very,  very  severely 
specifically because of some of the things that my colleague Senator 
Sununu  talked  about—is  that  we  can’t  predict—the  technology  is 
changing  so  fast,  entrepreneurs  are  out  there,  coming  up  with  dif-
ferent ways of doing things on the Internet, and what the Internet 
is going to look like 5 years from now, there isn’t anybody in Amer-
ica  who  can  predict  that.  And  if  they  have  somewhat  of  a  guess 
that—they’ll  be  multigazillionaires  if  they’re  able  to  predict  what 
it’s going to look like. 

But, when you look at—when we should regulate, when the gov-
ernment  should  be  looking  at  regulating  is  mainly  when  market 
forces  aren’t  working,  when  the  market  forces  aren’t  allowing  for 
competition.  Regulation  is  basically  to  protect  consumers.  If  the 
market  isn’t  doing  an  efficient  job  of  that,  a  lot  of  times  it’s  time 
for  government  to  step  in.  In  every  one  of  the  cases  that  my  col-
leagues  have  talked  about,  especially  Senator  Kerry,  the  market

forces corrected it. He admitted that. Every single one of the cases 
that he talked about, the companies took action to correct that. 

So,  I  think  that  we  need  to  be  very,  very  careful  as  we  proceed 
with any type of laws or regulations dealing with the Internet. And 
I  think  the  FCC  would  also  be  well  advised  to  be  very,  very  cau-
tious in anything that they bring forward. 

And so, I appreciate Chairman Martin being here today, because 
what  we  are  dealing  with  can  have  some  fairly  profound  con-
sequences  on  the  future  of  commerce  in  the  United  States.  We 
want  to  be—I  agree  with—by  the  way,  with  Senator  Kerry  about 
us,  you  know,  not  having  the  deployment  of  broadband  in  the 
United  States  that  we  should  have.  I  would  say  that  if  we  would 
have  passed  my  bill  from  a  couple  of  years  ago,  we  would  have  a 
lot better deployment of broadband in the United States, but that’s 
another story for another day. 

The bottom line is, this Committee—I think one of the important 
parts  of  this  Committee  is  to  bring  out  things  that  may  be  hap-
pening  in  the  marketplace  so  that  we  don’t  have  to  do  regulation. 
A  lot  times,  one  the  greatest  powers  that  we  have  as  Senators  is 
the  power  to  convene,  the  power  to  shine  light  in  places,  and  to 
bring  out—to  make  sure  that  there  is  transparency.  And  in  a  lot 
of cases, when you do that, you don’t need to regulate, because just 
the  threat  of  regulation  can  make  the  market  do  the  right  thing. 
And  so,  I  think  it’s  important  that  we’re  very,  very  cautious,  be-
cause  once  regulations  are  put  into  place,  once  laws  are  put  into 
place, they’re very difficult to change. So, we ought to be very, very 
cautious as we proceed, and making sure that if the market is cor-
recting itself, that we ought to allow the market to do its job. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

brief. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’ll  try  to  be 

I’m glad of this hearing. Chairman Martin, I’m happy to see you. 
You’re  not  looking  very  cheerful  right  now,  and  you  usually  do,  so 
I want you to be glad that you’re here. 

So,  ‘‘The  Future  of  the  Internet’’—lofty  title,  lots  of  things  im-
plied.  I  think  it’s  useful  to  look  forward.  It’s  also  useful  to  look 
back. I want to do that. 

Forty  years  ago,  as  John  Kerry  said,  DARPA—and  it  was  the 
‘‘network  of  networks,’’  that’s  what  it  was  called  at  that  time,  and 
later  became  the  Internet.  The  Internet  started  with  the  Govern-
ment,  as  today  the  relationship  between  Internet  and  the  govern-
ment  continues.  In  fact,  I  believe  it  is  a  myth  that  the  Internet  is 
not  regulated.  It  is  regulated,  in  a  variety  of  ways.  We  have  rules 
to protect consumers against the nuisance of unwanted e-mail solic-
itation  or  spam,  we  require  voice  communications  providers  that 
use the Internet to offer 9–1–1 emergency service to their users, we 
require providers of these services to support our Universal Service 
policy. We have programs that put the Internet in our schools, pro-

grams to support the use of telemedicine, and laws that seek to di-
versify the range of broadband Internet service providers. 

So, in short, Congress—we do pay attention to the lifeblood of the 
Internet,  and  we  should.  We  want  to  foster  an  environment  where 
it can grow and thrive and where the core values that have always 
driven  our  communications  policy—and  there  are  three:  consumer 
protection,  universal  deployment,  and  competition—continue  to 
propel us forward into the Internet Age even farther. 

So,  this  is  what  I  see  at  issue  in  the  future  of  the  Internet.  Will 
we  take  these  values  and  see  to  it  that  they  inspire  the  next  gen-
eration  of  great  innovation?  Will  we  squander  them  with  a  mis-
guided notion that all is well—we can do that if we want—and that 
the  unfettered  market  will  serve  the  interests  of  our  largest  busi-
nesses and our individual consumers alike? 

Taking the matter of broadband, that Senator Kerry was talking 
about,  I  am  frustrated  beyond  any  description  by  the  lack  of  it  in 
so  many  parts  of  a,  granted,  very  rural  and  difficult  State  of  West 
Virginia.  I,  for  one,  am  very  worried.  The  Internet  and  broadband 
represents  our  next  great  infrastructure  challenge.  It’s  on  a  par 
with  the  interstate  roads,  railroads,  port  projects  that  defined  our 
commerce in the last century. But, we have yet to treat the deploy-
ment of broadband with any kind of seriousness that it deserves its 
spotty,  industrial,  you  know,  high  return,  and  then  occasionally 
somebody  throws  out,  ‘‘Well,  we’ll  put  it  in  this  rural  county,’’  and 
I  can’t  buy  that.  I  simply  can’t  buy  that.  The  world  is  passing  us 
by,  building  more  robust  systems  with  greater  bandwidth,  more 
possibilities  for  education,  entertainment,  and  entrepreneurship. 
This is not something to be proud of in this country. The time has 
come for a different discussion, a discussion that recognizes the via-
ble  role  of  the  government  in  ensuring  open  broadband  networks 
for  all  of  our  citizens,  a  discussion  that  brings  along  with  it  the 
prospect of real consumer protection, a discussion that truly fosters 
competition,  and  a  discussion  that  ensures  that  the  Internet  will 
remain  a  creative  source  that  takes  inspiration  and  benefits  from 
the great genius of our citizens. 

I  think  we  have  a  lot  of  work  to  do  on  this.  I  look  forward  to  it. 

And I thank the Chair. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

Senator  THUNE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Mr.  Vice  Chair-
man,  for  calling  today’s  hearing  on  the  future  of  the  Internet,  or, 
more  specifically,  the  outlook  for  additional  regulation  on  network 
providers. 

Without question, the Internet’s become an essential part of most 
Americans’ daily lives. In fact, just a few years ago, individuals and 
businesses  used  the  Internet  to  simply  exchange  information  over 
e-mail and to post information on static Websites. Today, advances 
in technology and broadband deployment has led to an online revo-
lution  and  transformed  the  role  of  the  Internet  in  our  everyday 
lives.

Peer-to-peer  networking,  iTunes,  YouTube,  and  downloading  HD 
videos  were  hardly  envisioned  just  a  few  years  ago.  And  by  2010, 
the  average  household  will  be  using  1.1  terabytes  of  bandwidth 
each  month,  which,  incidentally,  Mr.  Chairman,  is  an  amount 
equal  to  1,000  copies  of  the  Encyclopedia  Britannica.  At  that  rate, 
just  20  homes  would  account  for  more  bandwidth  than  the  entire 
Internet in 1995. 

Now,  throughout  this  period  of  exceptional  innovation,  there’s 
been  very  little  regulation  on  the  Internet.  At  this  time,  and  by 
most  accounts,  the  Internet  is  thriving.  In  several  respects,  the 
light  regulatory  touch  of  the  Federal  Government,  as  succeeded. 
Revenues  from  Internet  sales  of  goods  and  services  have  grown  to 
more  than  $135  billion  in  2007,  which  represents  a  20-percent  in-
crease  from  2006.  And,  in  fact,  in  the  last  year,  online  video  view-
ing  has  increased  66  percent.  Moving  forward,  Congress  should 
continue to incentive broadband access nationwide, with particular 
emphasis  on  rural  areas  where  broadband  is  essential  to  economic 
growth. And Congress also ought to be promoting investment in in-
novation  in  Internet  networks  through  a  variety  of  business  mod-
els, and ensure the free flow of information through advanced net-
works. 

I appreciate the testimony that we’re going to receive today from 
today’s witnesses. Your input on this important issue is going to be 
critical  and  help  this  Committee  adjust  our  policies  in  accordance 
with the very dynamic Internet community. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr.  Chairman,  last  time  you  offered  for  me  to  make  an  opening 
statement and I declined, Senator Sununu came over and criticized 
me for not making an opening statement. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator SUNUNU. I just wanted to hear from you. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  PRYOR.  So,  I  guess  I’m  reminded  of  a  saying  that  Con-
gressman Marion Berry from Arkansas has, where he says, ‘‘Every-
thing  has  been  said,  but  not  everybody  has  said  it.’’  And  I  think 
that—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  PRYOR.—the  opening  statements  that  we  all  have  made 

today really cover the issues I want to talk about. 

But,  I  do  want  to  thank  Chairman  Martin  for  coming  in.  It’s  al-
ways great to have you before the Committee. And, Chairman Mar-
tin,  I  want  to  especially  thank  you  for  the  courtesy  visit  that  we 
had several days ago, and I just appreciate the tasks and the chal-
lenges  you  have  there,  and  look  forward  to  hearing  your  thoughts 
on  the  future  of  the  Internet.  And,  obviously,  rural  broadband  is 
very,  very  important  to  many  of  us  on  this  Committee,  and  I  look 
forward to hearing your thoughts on that. 

Thank you.

STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Senator SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
In the interest of time, I’ll put my longer statement in the record, 

with your permission—— 

The CHAIRMAN. Without objection. 
Senator SMITH.—and my colleagues’ assent. 
Let  me  just  sum  my  concerns  into  three  parts.  I  think  the  ques-
tion,  moving  forward,  is  whether  the  public  interest  is  served  by 
heavy-handed government regulation or policies that will empower 
agencies  with  the  agility  and  tools  to  go  after  unfair  and  anti-
competitive behavior on the Internet. 

It’s  my  belief  that  innovation  and  investment  are  encouraged 
through  less,  rather  than  more,  government  regulation.  I  also  be-
lieve  that  anticompetitive  behavior  on  the  Internet  must  be  met 
with  swift  and  decisive  responses  from  Federal  agencies  charged 
with  policing  such  conduct.  I,  finally,  Mr.  Chairman,  want  to  em-
phasize  one  piece  of  this  debate  that  I  think  we  need  to  keep  in 
mind  as  the  debate  moves  forward.  I  think  that  intellectual  prop-
erty rights must be part of any discussions that consider the future 
of  the  Internet.  Illegal  content  distribution  over  the  Internet  is  a 
large part of the economic harm caused by piracy each year. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I’ll put the rest in the record. 
The CHAIRMAN. Without objection. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Smith follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH, U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 
Thank  you,  Chairman  Inouye,  for  holding  this  important  hearing  on  the  Future 

of the Internet. 
Competitiveness 

I think we are all well aware on this Committee that several nations are now out-
pacing the United States in broadband deployment. There are severe economic con-
sequences  in  failing  to  keep  pace  with  the  broadband  infrastructure  being  deployed 
in  other  parts  of  the  world.  If  we  do  not  invest  in  the  broadband,  companies  will 
move  jobs  overseas  where  the  infrastructure  meets  their  needs  in  the  21st  century. 
Innovative technologies will be invented elsewhere. It is vital to our continued com-
petitiveness in the global marketplace that we have a frank discussion on our Inter-
net  policies  today  in  order  to  restore  our  global  leadership  in  broadband  networks 
tomorrow. 

Congress  must  act  now  to  define  a  national  broadband  strategy.  At  a  minimum 
this  strategy  must  include:  (1)  identifying  where  broadband  is  and  where  it  is  not; 
(2)  reforming  funding  mechanisms  to  support  broadband,  (3)  maximizing  spectrum 
efficiencies to expedite deployment of wireless broadband solutions and (4) removing 
barriers to community broadband deployment. I am proud to have introduced bi-par-
tisan legislation that advances each of these objectives. 
Net Neutrality 

I  think  we  are  all  also  aware  on  this  Committee  that  it  has  proved  difficult  to 
enact  any  real  national  broadband  policies  with  the  specter  of  a  net  neutrality  de-
bate looming. My hope is that today’s public discussion on net neutrality will reveal 
that there is more common ground here than some folks would suggest and perhaps 
a  path  down  which  we  can  proceed  for  the  common  good.  For  instance  I  think  we 
could all agree that our Internet policies should: 

• advance innovation at the edges as well as investment in networks; 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:29 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 074893 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74893.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

12 

against the theft of intellectual property online; and 

• allow  for  legal  peer-to-peer  file  sharing  applications  while  strictly  safeguarding 
• empower  network  operators  with  the  freedom  to  address  increasing  congestion 
in  their  pipes  while  rigorously  ferreting  out  and  punishing  anticompetitive  be-
havior. 

We  should  settle  the  debate  about  the  ends  and  get  serious  in  the  debate  about 
the  means—how  we  go  about  encouraging  broadband  deployment  and  preserving 
the open and interconnected Internet. The question moving forward should be about 
whether the public interest is served through heavy handed government regulation, 
as  some  have  proposed,  or  policies  that  will  empower  agencies  with  the  agility  and 
tools  to  go  after  unfair  and  anticompetitive  behavior  on  the  Internet.  I  continue  to 
believe  that  innovation  and  investment  are  encouraged  through  less  rather  than 
more  government  regulation.  I  also  believe  that  anticompetitive  behavior  on  the 
Internet  must  be  met  with  swift  and  decisive  responses  from  the  Federal  agencies 
charged with policing such conduct. 
Piracy 

Finally,  I  think  that  intellectual  property  rights  must  be  apart  of  any  discussion 
that considers the future of the Internet. Illegal content distribution over the Inter-
net is a large part of the economic harm caused by piracy each year. In 2005, Amer-
ican  workers  saw  an  estimated  141,000  jobs  lost  and  $5.5  billion  in  lost  earnings 
as  a  result  of  motion  picture  piracy.  The  economy’s  losses  from  illegal  music 
downloading were likewise reported at around $3.7 billion in 2007. 

With the Chairman’s permission, I would ask that the Motion Picture Association

I welcome panelists here today and thank you for your testimony. 

The CHAIRMAN. And now, I call upon the Vice Chairman. 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator STEVENS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  would  like  to  welcome  Chairman  Martin.  I  think  it’s  very  im-
portant,  particularly—we  look  forward  to  hearing  some  comments 
concerning your meetings in Harvard and Stanford. 

Senator Kerry said that this is a problem seeking a solution, but 
from my point of view, this is a solution seeking some justification. 
And  I  certainly  hope  that  the  FCC,  as  well  as  the  Congress,  are 
very  careful  about  taking  this  first  step  of  going  back  to  really  in-
tense—intensive  regulation  of  the  Internet.  That’s  what  ‘‘net  neu-
trality’’ means to me. Eventually, there would be extension of regu-
lation  to  the  point  where  it  would  be,  really,  interference  with  the 
dynamics of the Internet and its future. 

I  do  believe  that  there  are  many  comments  out  there.  For  in-
stance, I’d like to file, for the record, the article entitled, ‘‘Network 
Neutrality and the False Promise of Zero-Priced Regulation,’’ by C. 
Scott  Hemphill  and  a  group  of  very  erudite  people  at  Columbia.* 
And  it  does  seem  to  me  that  this  public  discussion  that’s  going 
on  is  good  for  the  system.  But,  to  take  action  based  on  it,  either 
by the Congress or by the FCC, at this time, I think’s entirely un-
warranted.  The  action  that  Senator  Kerry  mentioned,  that  was 
called  to  attention,  the  public  indignation,  the  outcry  from  the  in-
dustry  showed  that  the  system  will  right  itself  if  someone  really 
tries  to  interfere  with  the  free  access  and,  really,  fair  treatment  of 
everyone using the Internet. So, I do not believe that this is a time

to  try  to  put  in  a  law  or  into  a  regulation  a  concept  of  net  neu-
trality that is not validated yet. If something comes along that real-
ly  deserves  such  attention,  it  will  be  broad  enough  and  a  great 
enough  incentive  for  us  to  stop  this  political  division  over  the  con-
cept of net neutrality. It is a political division now, and it’s getting 
more  so.  It’s  unfortunate,  because  I  do  not  think  that  communica-
tions  law  ought  to  come  about  because  of  political  division  in  an 
election year. 

Thank you very much. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Mr. Chairman, you’ve heard a full spectrum of views of the Com-

mittee. Now it’s your turn, sir. 

Chairman Martin? 

STATEMENT OF HON. KEVIN J. MARTIN, CHAIRMAN, 

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 

Mr.  MARTIN.  Well,  thank  you.  And  good  morning,  Chairman 
Inouye,  and  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  and  all  the  members  of  the 
Committee.  I  appreciate  you  allowing  me  to  testify  before  you 
today. 

I  thought  it  important  to  update  the  Committee  on  the  work  in 
progress of the Commission with respect to the future of the Inter-
net,  particularly  after  our  en  banc  hearing  on  the  issue,  just  last 
week. 

Over the past decade, the Internet has had a powerful impact on 
the  economy  and  on  the  lives  of  American  citizens.  We  witnessed 
the  fruits  of  increased  innovation,  entrepreneurship,  and  competi-
tion  that  this  technology  has  helped  deliver.  Any  rules  of  the  road 
in  this  area  must  maintain  an  open  and  dynamic  Internet,  pre-
serving it as an engine of productivity and innovation that benefits 
all Americans. 

The Commission is obligated to preserve and promote the vibrant 
and open character of the Internet. In 2005, the Commission adopt-
ed an Internet policy statement containing four key principles. The 
goal  was  to  clarify  how  we  would  evaluate  broadband  Internet 
practices on a going-forward basis. Specifically, the statement says 
that,  ‘‘To  encourage  broadband  deployment  and  preserve  and  pro-
mote  the  open  and  interconnected  nature  of  the  public  Internet, 
consumers  are  entitled  to  access  the  lawful  Internet  content  of 
their  choice;  consumers  are  entitled  to  run  applications  and  use 
services  of  their  choice,  subject  to  the  needs  of  law  enforcement; 
consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that 
do  not  harm  the  network;  and  consumers  are  entitled  to  competi-
tion  among  network  providers,  application  service  providers,  and 
content providers. Now, the Commission explicitly noted that these 
principles allow for reasonable network management. 

As the expert communications agency, it was appropriate for the 
Commission  to  adopt,  and  it  is  the  Commission’s  role  to  enforce, 
this Internet policy statement. The Supreme Court, in its Brand X 
decision,  specifically  recognized  the  Commission’s  authority  to 
adopt regulations to protect broadband Internet access. 

I  do  not  believe  any  additional  regulations  are  needed  at  this 
time,  because  we  have  a  complaint  and  adjudication  process,  but  I 
do  believe  that  the  Commission  has  the  responsibility  to  enforce

14 

the principles that it has already adopted. Indeed, on several occa-
sions, the entire Commission has reiterated that it has the author-
ity and will enforce these current principles. 

For  example,  in  2006,  when  I  appeared  before  this  committee, 
then-Chairman Stevens asked me whether the Commission had the 
existing  authority  to  take  action  if  a  problem  developed,  and  I  re-
sponded  that  the  Commission  had  authority,  under  Title  I,  to  en-
force  consumers’  unfettered  access  to  the  Internet  when,  one  year 
ago,  the  Commission  committed  to  enforcing  our  existing  prin-
ciples—specifically,  the  Commission  stated  that,  quote,  ’’The  Com-
mission,  under  Title  I,  of  the  Communications  Act,  has  the  ability 
to  adopt  and  enforce  the  net  neutrality  principles  it  announced  in 
the  Internet  policy  statement.‘‘  In  fact,  we  have  already  taken  en-
forcement  action  in  response  to  other  complaints.  In  the  Madison 
River  complaint,  the  Commission  ordered  a  telephone  company  to 
stop blocking Voice-over-IP calls. 

The  Commission  should  address  issues  of  appropriate  network 
management  using  a  consistent  framework.  There  are  several  fac-
tors that I believe the Commission should consider: 

First,  the  Commission  should  consider  whether  the  network 
management  practices  are  intended  to  distinguish  between  legal 
and  illegal  activity.  The  Commission’s  network  principles  only  rec-
ognize  and  protect  a  user’s  access  to  legal  content.  The  sharing  of 
illegal  content,  such  as  child  pornography  or  pirated  material,  is 
not protected. Similarly, applications that are intended to harm the 
network are not protected. 

Second,  the  Commission  should  consider  whether  the  network 
service  provider  has  adequately  disclosed  its  network  management 
practices. A hallmark of whether something is reasonable is wheth-
er  an  operator  is  willing  to  precisely  and  fully  disclose  what  it  is 
they are doing. Application designers need to understand what will 
and will not work on a particular network, and consumers must be 
fully  informed  about  the  exact  nature  of  the  service  they  are  pur-
chasing, and any potential limitations on that service. For example, 
has  the  consumer  been  informed  that  certain  applications  used  to 
watch  video  will  not  work  properly  when  there  is  high  congestion? 
Additionally,  consumers  need  to  be  assured  that  the  broadband 
network  operators  are  able  to  deliver  the  speeds  of  service  that 
they  are  purchasing,  and  that  if  Internet  access  is  sold  as  an  un-
limited service, do consumers understand that if they use too much 
of it, they can still be cutoff? 

Now,  finally,  I  believe  the  Commission  should  consider  whether 
the  network  management  technique  arbitrarily  blocks  or  degrades 
a particular application. Is the network management practice selec-
tively  identifying  particular  applications  or  content  for  differential 
treatment?  If  so,  I  believe  we  should  evaluate  these  practices  with 
heightened scrutiny. The network operators should bear the burden 
of  demonstrating  that  the  practice  furthers  an  important  interest 
and  is  narrowly  tailored  to  serve  that  interest.  Such  an  approach 
would not mean that any action taken against a particular applica-
tion  would  automatically  be  a  violation.  Rather,  it  would  trigger  a 
more  searching  review  of  both  the  particular  concern  and  whether 
the network management solution was tailored to resolve that con-
cern in as narrow a manner as possible. Such practices should not

15 

be  overly  broad  in  their  application  so  that  they  become  over-  or 
under-inclusive.  For  example,  if  the  concern  is  about  stopping  ille-
gal content, a network provider should not block a particular appli-
cation to all users if that application transmits both legal and ille-
gal  content.  Rather,  it  should  filter  all  of  the  illegal  content  and 
permit the flow of material that is legal. 

An  analysis  considering  the  factors  I’ve  identified  would  recog-
nize the importance of legitimate network management techniques 
while  providing  a  framework  to  analyze  whether  carriers’  actions 
are reasonable on a case-by-case basis. 

Now,  consumers  have  recently  alleged  that  certain  operators— 
and  specifically,  Comcast—are  blocking  and/or  degrading  con-
sumers’ access to the Internet by targeting specific peer-to-peer ap-
plications.  The  Commission  is  still  investigating  these  complaints, 
and  we  have  not  yet  determined  whether  the  actions  violated  our 
principles protecting consumer access to the Internet. At our hear-
ings  in  Boston  and  Stanford,  we  heard  from  several  engineers  and 
technical  experts.  According  to  the  testimony  at  those  hearings, 
Comcast  appears  to  have  utilized  Internet  equipment  that  blocks 
certain  attempts  by  subscribers  to  upload  information  using  par-
ticular  legal  peer-to-peer  applications  by  pretending  to  be  the  sub-
scriber’s computer and falsifying a reset packet to end that commu-
nication.  It  also  degrades  the  corresponding  attempts  to  download 
information  using  the  same  peer-to-peer  applications.  Specifically, 
based on the testimony we have received thus far, some users were 
not able to upload any content that they wanted. 

It does not appear that this technique was used only to occasion-
ally delay traffic at particular nodes suffering from network conges-
tion at that time. Indeed, based on the testimony we have received 
thus  far,  this  equipment  was  typically  deployed  over  a  wider  geo-
graphic area or system, and it is not even capable of knowing when 
an  individual  cable  segment  of  the  network  is  congested.  This 
equipment  blocks  uploads  of  a  significant  portion  of  subscribers  in 
that  part  of  the  network,  regardless  of  the  actual  levels  of  conges-
tion at that particular time. 

Now,  as  the  Commission  continues  its  examination  of  the  com-
plaints  before  it,  it’s  critically  important  to  make  sure  that  we  are 
fully  informed,  and  we  need  to  fully  understand  what  impact  the 
operators’  actions  are  having  on  consumers’  broadband  experience 
so  that  we  may  better  evaluate  the  reasonableness  of  any  network 
management practice. 

Thank  you,  again,  for  the  opportunity  to  be  here,  and  I  look  for-

ward to answering any questions that you might have.

namic Internet that will allow it to continue to be an engine of productivity and in-
novation that benefits all Americans. 
I. FCC Principles Protecting Consumer Access to the Internet 

The  Commission  has  a  duty  to  preserve  and  promote  the  vibrant  and  open  char-
acter  of  the  Internet  as  the  telecommunications  marketplace  enters  the  broadband 
age. In 2005, the Commission adopted an Internet Policy Statement containing four 
principles.  The  Commission’s  goal  was  to  clarify  how  it  would  evaluate  broadband 
Internet practices on a going forward basis. 

Specifically, the Commission established the following principles: 
To  encourage  broadband  deployment  and  preserve  and  promote  the  open  and 

interconnected nature of the public Internet, 

ject to the needs of law enforcement; 

• Consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice; 
• Consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice, sub-
• Consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm 
• Consumers  are  entitled  to  competition  among  network  providers,  application 

the network; 

and service providers, and content providers. 

The  Commission  explicitly  noted  that  these  principles  were  subject  to  reasonable 

network management. 

The  Commission  was  seeking  to  protect  consumers’  access  to  the  lawful  online 
content  of  their  choice.  The  intent  of  these  principles  was  to  foster  the  creation, 
adoption  and  use  of  broadband  Internet  content,  applications,  and  services,  and  to 
ensure that consumers benefit from that innovation. 
II. FCC’s Role in Protecting Consumers and Enforcing Our Principles 

As  the  expert  communications  agency,  it  was  appropriate  for  the  Commission  to 

adopt, and it is the Commission’s role to enforce, this Internet Policy Statement. 

In  fact,  the  Supreme  Court  in  its  Brand  X  decision  specifically  recognized  the 
Commission’s  ancillary  authority  to  impose  regulations  as  necessary  to  protect 
broadband Internet access. 

I do not believe any additional regulations are needed at this time. But I also be-
lieve  that  the  Commission  has  a  responsibility  to  enforce  the  principles  that  it  has 
already adopted. Indeed, on several occasions, the entire Commission has reiterated 
that it has the authority and will enforce these current principles. 

For example, in 2006 when I appeared before this Committee, then Chairman Ste-
vens  asked  me  whether  the  Commission  had  the  existing  authority  to  take  action 
if  a  problem  developed.  And  I  responded  that  the  Commission  had  authority  under 
Title I to enforce consumers’ access to the Internet. 

Moreover, almost exactly 1 year ago, the Republican Majority of the Commission, 
with  the  Democrat  Commissioners  concurring,  committed  to  enforcing  our  existing 
principles  and  the  policy  statement.  Specifically,  in  April  2007,  the  Commission  ex-
pressly stated: 

The  Commission,  under  Title  I  of  the  Communications  Act,  has  the  ability  to 
adopt and enforce the net neutrality principles it announced in the Internet Pol-
icy  Statement.  The  Supreme  Court  reaffirmed  that  the  Commission  ‘‘has  juris-
diction to impose additional regulatory obligations under its Title I ancillary ju-
risdiction  to  regulate  interstate  and  foreign  communications.’’  Indeed,  the  Su-
preme  Court  specifically  recognized  the  Commission’s  ancillary  jurisdiction  to 
impose regulatory obligations on broadband Internet access providers.1 

Finally,  the  Commission  has  already  taken  enforcement  action  in  response  to 
other  complaints.  In  the  Madison  River  complaint,  the  Commission  ordered  a  tele-
phone company to stop blocking VoIP calls. 

Contrary  to  some  public  claims  about  Commission’s  approach  generally,  for  the 
Commission  to  take  enforcement  action  against  a  telephone  company  for  blocking 
and  degrading  a  particular  application  but  refuse  to  pursue  enforcement  action 
against  a  cable  company  blocking  or  degrading  a  particular  application  would  un-
fairly favor the cable industry. 

I  believe  that  the  Commission  must  remain  vigilant  in  protecting  consumers’  ac-
cess to content on the Internet Thus, it is critically important that the Commission 
take  seriously  and  respond  to  complaints  that  are  filed  about  arbitrary  limits  on

broadband  access  and  potential  violations  of  our  principles.  Indeed,  I  have  publicly 
stated  that  the  Commission  stands  ready  to  enforce  this  policy  statement  and  pro-
tect consumers’ access to the Internet. 
III.  Framework 

for  Evaluating  Reasonable  Network  Management 

Complaints 

The Commission should address issues of appropriate network management using 
a  consistent  framework.  There  are  several  factors  that  I  believe  the  Commission 
should  use  when  analyzing  complaints  and  concerns  about  network  management 
practices by broadband operators. 

First,  the  Commission  should  consider  whether  the  network  management  prac-
tices  are  intended  to  distinguish  between  legal  and  illegal  activity.  The  Commis-
sion’s  network  principles  only  recognize  and  protect  user’s  access  to  legal  content. 
The  sharing  of  illegal  content,  such  as  child  pornography  or  content  that  does  not 
have the appropriate copyright, is not protected by our principles. Similarly, applica-
tions that are intended to harm the network are not protected. 

Second,  the  Commission  should  consider  whether  the  network  service  provider 
adequately  disclosed  its  network  management  practices.  A  hallmark  of  whether 
something  is  reasonable  is  whether  an  operator  is  willing  to  disclose  fully  and  ex-
actly what they are doing. 

Adequate  disclosure  of  the  particular  traffic  management  tools  and  techniques— 
not  only  to  consumers  but  also  to  the  designers  of  various  applications  and  entre-
preneurs—is critical. 

Application  designers  need  to  understand  what  will  and  will  not  work  on  a  par-
ticular network. For example, does an application developer know that the operator 
may  actually  insert  reset  packets  during  a  session  masking  the  network  operator’s 
identity? 

Consumers must be fully informed about the exact nature of the service they are 
purchasing and any potential limitations associated with that service. For example, 
has  the  consumer  been  informed  that  certain  applications  used  to  watch  video  will 
not work properly when there is high congestion? 

Particularly as broadband providers begin providing more complex tiers of service, 
it’s  critical  to  make  sure  that  consumers  understand  whether  broadband  network 
operators are able to deliver the speeds of service that they are selling. For example, 
if  Internet  access  is  sold  as  an  unlimited  service,  do  consumers  understand  that  if 
they use too much of it they can still be cutoff? 

Finally,  the  Commission  should  consider  whether  the  network  management  tech-
nique  arbitrarily  blocks  or  degrades  a  particular  application.  Is  the  network  man-
agement  practice  selectively  identifying  particular  applications  or  content  for  dif-
ferential  treatment?  If  so,  I  believe  that  we  should  evaluate  the  practices  with 
heightened  scrutiny,  with  the  network  operator  bearing  the  burden  of  dem-
onstrating  that  the  particular  practice  furthered  an  important  interest,  and  that  it 
was narrowly tailored to serve that interest. 

Such an approach would not mean that any action taken against a particular ap-
plication would automatically be a violation. Rather, it would trigger a more search-
ing  review  of  both  the  particular  concern  and  whether  that  network  management 
solution  was  tailored  to  resolve  the  particular  harm  identified  to  the  network  in  as 
narrow a manner as possible. 

In a manner similar to the way in which restrictions on speech are analyzed, net-
work  management  solutions  would  need  to  further  a  compelling  or  at  least  an  im-
portant/legitimate  interest  and  would  need  to  be  tailored  to  fit  the  exact  interest. 
Such  practices  should  not  be  overly  broad  in  their  application  so  that  they  become 
over or under inclusive. For example, if the concern is about stopping certain illegal 
content,  a  network  provider  should  not  block  a  particular  application  to  all  users 
if that application transmits both legal and illegal content. 

Such  an  analysis  would  recognize  the  importance  of  legitimate  network  manage-
ment techniques while giving the Commission the framework to analyze carriers ac-
tions  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  As  we  move  into  an  era  in  which  network  operators 
are  taking  particularized  actions  against  individual  applications  and  content,  the 
Commission should evaluate such practices under sufficient scrutiny to ensure that 
whatever  actions  the  operators  are  taking  are  actually  furthering  a  legitimate  pur-
pose and are narrowly tailored to serving that legitimate purpose. 
IV. Pending Comcast Complaint 

Consumers  have  alleged  that  certain  operators,  and  specifically  Comcast,  are 
blocking  and/or  degrading  consumers’  access  to  the  Internet  by  distinguishing  be-
tween applications. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:29 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 074893 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74893.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

18 

The  Commission  has  heard  from  several  engineers  and  technical  experts  who 
have  raised  questions  regarding  the  network  management  techniques  used  by 
Comcast for peer-to-peer traffic. 

The Commission is still investigating these complaints and we have not yet deter-
mined whether the actions violated our principles protecting consumer access to the 
Internet.  However,  Comcast  appears  to  have  utilized  Internet  equipment  from 
Sandvine  or  something  similar  that  is  widely  known  to  be  a  relatively  inexpensive, 
blunt  means  to  reduce  peer-to-peer  traffic  by  blocking  certain  traffic  completely.  In 
contrast,  more  modern  equipment  can  be  finely  tuned  to  slow  traffic  to  certain 
speeds based on various levels of congestion. 

Specifically,  this  equipment:  (1)  blocks  certain  attempts  by  subscribers  to  upload 
information  using  particular  legal  peer-to-peer  applications  by  pretending  to  be  the 
subscriber’s computer and falsifying a ‘‘reset’’ packet to end the communication, and 
(2)  degrades  the  corresponding  attempts  to  download  information  using  the  same 
peer-to-peer applications. 

Based on the testimony we have received thus far, I think it is important to clar-

ify a few points. 

Contrary to some claims, it does not appear that cable modem subscribers had the 
ability  to  do  anything  they  wanted  on  the  Internet.  Specifically,  based  on  the  testi-
mony we have received thus far, some users were not able to upload anything they 
wanted and were unable to fully use certain file sharing software from peer-to-peer 
networks. 

Contrary  to  some  claims,  it  does  not  appear  this  network  management  technique 
is  ‘‘content  agnostic.’’  Indeed,  Comcast  has  publicly  stated  that  it  will  migrate  to  a 
‘‘protocol’’ (content) agnostic approach to traffic management in the future, and thus 
conceded that the techniques currently in use are not ‘‘content agnostic.’’ 

Contrary to some claims, it does not appear that this technique was used only to 
occasionally  delay  traffic  at  particular  nodes  suffering  from  network  congestion  at 
that time. Indeed, based on the testimony we have received thus far, this equipment 
is  typically  deployed  over  a  wider  geographic  or  system  area  and  would  therefore 
have  impacted  numerous  nodes  within  a  system  simultaneously.  Moreover,  the 
equipment  apparently  used  does  not  appear  to  have  the  ability  to  know  when  an 
individual  cable  segment  is  congested.  It  appears  that  this  equipment  blocks  the 
uploads of at least a large portion of subscribers in that part of the network, regard-
less of the actual levels of congestion at that particular time. 

Finally, contrary to some claims, it is not clear when they will actually stop using 
their  current  approach.  They  claim  that  they  will  deploy  this  new  solution  by  the 
end of the year but it is unclear whether they will be finished deploying their solu-
tion or just starting that migration. Indeed the question is not when they will begin 
using  a  new  approach  but  if  and  when  they  are  committing  to  stop  using  the  old 
one. 
V. Next Steps 

As  the  Commission  continues  its  investigation  into  the  complaints  before  it,  the 
most  important  and  first  step  that  we  can  take  in  fulfilling  our  responsibility  is  to 
make  sure  that  we  are  fully  informed.  At  the  very  least,  we  need  to  obtain  greater 
information to more fully understand what is happening and what impact operators’ 
actions  are  having  so  that  we  may  better  evaluate  the  reasonableness  of  any  net-
work management practices at issue. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Chairman  Martin,  you’ve  just  testified  that  you  believe  the  FCC 
has  sufficient  enforcement  authority  to  resolve  network  neutrality 
issues.  Now,  if  you  proceed  to  use  this  authority,  I  suppose  you 
would  expect  subsequent  litigation  challenging  your  ability  to  act 
in  this  area.  If  your  answer  is  yes,  do  you  believe  that  additional 
authority from the Congress is necessary, or is there sufficient au-
thority at the present time? 

Mr.  MARTIN.  I  think  that  the  Commission  has  sufficient  author-
ity.  I  did  ask  several  witnesses  at  the  hearing  in  Cambridge,  at 
Harvard,  about  whether  they  thought  we  had  the  authority.  Some 
of  the  carriers  testified  that  they  did.  Verizon  responded  that  they 
thought  we  did  have  the  authority.  Comcast  said  they  wanted  to

get  back  to  us,  and  they’ve  subsequently  filed  a  letter  saying  they 
do not believe we have the authority. 

I believe we do have the sufficient authority to do that, but I be-
lieve  you  are  right,  that  there  may  be  subsequent  litigation  by 
some  of  the  carriers  as  a  result.  At  least  that’s  what  they  seem  to 
indicate in their most recent response to me. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Stevens? 
Senator  STEVENS.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  a  conflict,  and  I  would 
hope  that  I’d  be  able  to  submit  my  questions  for  the  record  for  all 
the witnesses. 
Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Without objection. 
Senator Dorgan? 
Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
Before Senator Stevens leaves—he indicated that nondiscrimina-
tion  rules  represented  intensive  regulation.  The  Internet  was  cre-
ated—— 

Senator  STEVENS.  I  said  it  would  lead  to  intensive  regulation.  It 

would lead to—— 

restoring—— 

Senator DORGAN. Right, the restoration. But, my point was, we’re 

Senator STEVENS. It would lead to intensive—— 
Senator  DORGAN.—we  are  restoring  that  which  previously  ex-
isted.  My  question  is  the  nondiscrimination  requirements  with  re-
spect to service, that preceded your determination by the FCC, that 
‘‘information  services  shall  not  be  subject  to  the  nondiscrimination 
rule,’’  did  that  nondiscrimination  requirement  represent  intensive 
regulation,  in  your  judgment,  as  the  Internet  was  created  and  de-
veloped and flowered? 

Mr. MARTIN. I’m not sure that nondiscrimination represented in-
tensive  requirements.  I  believe  that  some  of  the  common-carrier 
regulations that went beyond that, that were attached to that tele-
communications service category, might—— 

Senator  DORGAN.  Right,  but  I’m  talking  now  about  the  non-

discrimination rules—— 

Mr. MARTIN. No, I don’t think it means that it leads to an inten-
sive  requirement.  I  would  say  that  I  would  be  cautious  about  a 
pure nondiscrimination requirement, because there are positive at-
tributes of discrimination; for example, in saying that voice packets 
might  be  preferable  because  of  the  need  for  that  being  able  to  be 
delivered on a timely basis—— 

Senator DORGAN. I understand that. 
Mr. MARTIN.—over other kinds of data. 
Senator  DORGAN.  No,  I  understand  that.  And  I  understand  the 
issue  that  you’ve  raised  about  the  management  of  the  system  and 
various  things.  I  think  Senator  Snowe  and  I  and  others,  like  Sen-
ator  Kerry,  who  have  tried  to  advance  this  legislation  understand 
the  need  to  be  able  to  manage  the  system,  but,  my  point  is  we’ve 
heard  a  lot  this  morning  about—that  this  is  re-regulation  and  po-
tentially  intensive  regulation.  My  point,  very  simply,  is  that  to  re-
store  that  which  previously  existed  in  the  earlier  formation  of  the 
Internet—it  was  not  intensive  regulation,  it  simply  said  that,  over 
the  entire  range  of  these  services,  the  nondiscrimination  rules 
would apply.

Now,  I’d  like  to  ask  you—first  of  all,  as  you  have  indicated, 
Comcast has filed a decision they have made that—or at least their 
interpretation—that  you  do  not  have  the  authority  on  the  matter 
that is before you with respect to Comcast. Isn’t that correct? 

Mr. MARTIN. That’s correct. 
Senator  DORGAN.  So,  at  this  point,  a  very  large  provider,  who, 
with  a  lot  of  legal  resources,  says  you  don’t  have  authority—well, 
let  me  ask  you,  Do  you  believe  that  you  need  this  authority?  You 
believe  you  have  it.  I  assume  you  believe  you  have  it,  and  you  be-
lieve you need it, correct? 

Mr. MARTIN. That’s correct. I think—— 
Senator DORGAN. So—— 
Mr. MARTIN. I think it’s important that we have that. 
Senator  DORGAN.  So,  what  if  a  court  says  they  agree  with 
Comcast  and  you  don’t  have  it?  You  will  come  to  us  and  ask  that 
we restore that capability? 

Mr. MARTIN. Obviously, I think it is important that we have the 
ability  to  ensure  that  consumers  have  unfettered  access  to  the 
Internet,  and  if  a  court  said  that  we  did  not  have  that  authority, 
I think someone needs to be ensuring—— 

Senator  DORGAN.  So,  would  giving  you  that  authority  be  regu-
lating, as some of my colleagues have suggested—re-regulating—— 

Mr. MARTIN. I don’t—— 
Senator DORGAN.—intensive regulation? 
Mr. MARTIN. I don’t believe that just merely providing us the au-
thority, without requirements that we do anything with it, particu-
larly adopting rules, would be re-regulating. No, sir. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Now,  let  me  talk  about  a  network  service  pro-
vider—the  Commission  should  consider  whether  the  network  serv-
ice  provider  adequately  disclosed  its  network  management  prac-
tices.  I  distinguish  on  ‘‘management  practices,’’  as  I  understand 
that,  that  they  may  have  a  whole  class  of  services  that  they  have 
to manage in a certain way—voice versus data, and so on. But, let’s 
say  that  a  network  service  provider  disclosed  to  me,  as  a  con-
sumer—and  I’m  living  in  a  part  of  the  country  where  I  have  prob-
ably  one  or  two  opportunities  to  get  my  broadband,  so  very  little 
competition,  which  is  the  case  in  most  parts  of  this  country,  I 
might say—and the network service provider came to me and said, 
‘‘Well,  here’s  the  way  we  do  business.  You  can  get  to  most  of  the 
Internet pretty well, but I’m a provider that has said to the largest 
content  sites  out  there,  ‘You’ve  got  to  pay  me  a  little  bit  in  order 
to be delivered to the homes that I service,’ so you should just know 
that  I’ve  got  a  little  toll  that  I  apply  to  certain  areas.’’  Would  that 
adequately  disclose,  to  consumers,  practices  that  you  would  think 
are fine? 

Mr.  MARTIN.  I  think  that  it’s  important  that  there  be  adequate 
disclosure. Adequate disclosure doesn’t make the practice fine; we’d 
still  have  to  evaluate  whether  or  not  it  was  a  reasonable  practice. 
But,  I  certainly  think  that  failing  to  disclose  it  is  an  unreasonable 
practice. And I think that’s the way I would describe it. So, in your 
hypothetical, if a carrier was not disclosing to consumers that they 
were  preventing  you  from  going  to  a  Website  unless  that  Website 
paid  them,  I  think  that  that  would  be  a  problem.  However,  if  they 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:29 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 074893 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74893.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

21 

disclosed it, we would have to analyze the exact facts of what they 
were doing to determine whether it was a reasonable action. 

Senator  DORGAN.  But,  Chairman  Martin,  you  believe  you  need 
the  authority  to  take  action  in  these  cases.  I’m  trying  to  under-
stand what kind of provocations would incite you to action. But—— 

Mr. MARTIN. Well—— 
Senator DORGAN.—let me, just for a moment, and then I’m going 

to ask you to answer—— 

I want to describe, Mr. Chairman, why I think this is important. 
And  I  want  to  do  it—I’ll  use  a  big  content  provider,  Google.  OK? 
Google’s  a  behemoth  out  there,  right?  Didn’t  used  to  be.  And  my 
understanding  is,  in  I  believe  it  was  1998,  Larry  and  Sergei,  two 
guys  that  were  in  a  dorm  room,  moved  to  a  garage  that  had  a  ga-
rage-door  opener,  because  it  was  such  an  exciting  thing.  They  had 
eight  employees,  or  whatever  it  was,  and  they  moved  to  a  garage 
with a garage-door opener. Ten years later, that company is larger 
than  General  Motors,  Ford  Motors,  and  Coca  Cola,  combined,  in 
market valuation. Now, that’s pretty unbelievable. 

The  question  is  this.  When  Whitacre  or  somebody  says,  ‘‘You 
know,  I  want  to  start  charging  a  company  that  big  for  the  pipes,’’ 
well,  you  start  charging  for  pipes  and  charging  content  providers 
and  so  on.  Are  there  other  kids  in  a  college  dorm  room  out  there 
that have another new idea that will never have access to the rest 
of  this  country  if  we’ve  got  content  providers  that  say,  ‘‘I’m  at  the 
end  of  the  funnel,  and  I’m,  by  God,  going  to  decide  who  gets 
through  and  who  doesn’t  get  through,  based  on  how  much  money 
I get, who gets put in a bus lane, who gets put in a fast lane,’’ just 
describing the determination of how they want to treat content. My 
question is whether this doesn’t inevitably defeat the opportunity— 
unfettered  opportunity  for  innovation  in  this  country.  And  again,  I 
will  say,  those  who  have  argued  so  vociferously  this  morning 
against  the  Internet  Freedom  Act  are  saying,  ‘‘We  don’t  like  the 
issue of nondiscrimination.’’ By virtue of their argument, they must 
be standing up for discrimination. If so, what kind? What will that 
mean? How will that change the Internet? 

So,  I’m  trying  to—first  of  all,  I  appreciate  your  being  here,  and 
I  appreciate  your  testimony.  I  believe  what  you  are  saying  is  that 
you  believe  you  need  authority  to  take  action  in  these  areas.  And 
I’m just telling you, one of the biggest content providers says, ‘‘You 
don’t  have  that  authority.’’  So,  shouldn’t  you  ask  us  to  do  some-
thing  to  get  that  authority,  in  the  event  that  this  is  unclear  and 
you spend the next 3 or 4 years in court? 

Mr.  MARTIN.  Well,  as  I  said,  I  believe  we  do  need  the  authority. 
I  think  that  we  do  have  the  authority  to  do  it.  I  think  the  courts 
have said that. But, I certainly agree with you, we need the author-
ity.  I  think  you  asked  me  to  give  you  some  sense  of  what  actions 
I  think  would  be  unreasonable,  and  I  certainly  think  if  a  network 
operator  was  saying  that  every  time  you  type  in  ‘‘Google’’—you 
wanted  to  go  to  Google,  they  were  redirecting  you  to  Yahoo!,  be-
cause  Yahoo!  was  paying  them  and  Google  wasn’t,  I  think  that 
would be a problem. And I think that would be a problem whether 
they  disclosed  it  or  not.  Merely  telling  consumers  that  they  were 
doing  that  would  not  turn  it  into  a  reasonable  practice.  So,  that’s 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:29 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 074893 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74893.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

22 

the  kind  of  action  I  think  we  would  need  the  authority  to  take  ac-
tion against. 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, I’ve taken longer than I should, 
but I have one final point. The issue of discrimination is a very im-
portant provision here. A provider, in my judgment, could decide to 
deliver  voice  packets  faster  for  a  certain  reason,  based  on 
prioritization,  in  order  to  manage  their  network,  and  that  would 
not  be  discrimination.  They  can  do  that  without  being  discrimina-
tory.  But,  a  provider  that  decides,  as  the  fellow  from—I  was  read-
ing,  this  morning,  about  the  fellow  from  England  who’s  setting  up 
a company, Virgin something or another, saying, ‘‘You know, I’m’’— 
I  don’t  think  I  have  the  quote  here,  but  he’s  essentially  saying, 
‘‘Look,  I  have  every  right  to  be  charging  the  content  folks  out 
there.’’  I  know  that’s  another  country,  but  it’s  exactly  the  same 
principle  of  why  we’re  trying  to  determine  how  we  might  legislate, 
here,  to  restore  that  which  always  existed  in  the  creation  of  the 
Internet: nondiscrimination rules. 

I  find  it  unbelievable  that  this  is  controversial.  Who  on  earth  is 
standing  up  for  discrimination?  I  mean,  it’s  just  unbelievable  to 
suggest  that  this  is  some  sort  of  intensive  regulation.  It  is  not.  It 
is  a  restoration  of  something  that  has  great  common  sense.  Open 
architecture  of  the  Internet,  open  innovation,  and  nondiscrimina-
tion rules that always existed prior to the FCC taking action iden-
tifying it as an information service. Let’s finally do the right thing. 
And,  Mr.  Chairman,  I’ve  taken  more  than  my  time.  I  appreciate 

it. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kerry? 
Senator KERRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Let me pick up, a little bit, if I may, Chairman Martin, on some 

of this line of questioning. 

First  of  all,  it  seems  to  me  obvious,  on  the  face  of  it,  that,  as  an 
administrative agency, if there is a lack of clarity as to whether or 
not  you  have  authority,  and  you  are  already  on  notice  by  a  major 
player  in  this  sector  that  they  believe  you  don’t,  you’re  looking  at 
a lawsuit. 

Mr. MARTIN. I think that’s right. That carrier has said that they 
do not want us to take action, and that we don’t have the authority 
to do it, and it’s in a complaint that’s in front of us today. 

Senator KERRY. And isn’t it standard procedure within the legis-
lative process that if there is a lack of clarity as to something with-
in a federally constituted agency, that it is up to the Congress to— 
if  it  has  an  intent  it  wants  to  have  enforced,  to  clarify  what  that 
intent is? 

Or to state the intent, ab initio, that—from the beginning. 
Mr. MARTIN. Sure. Absolutely. I think part of the reason—— 
Senator  KERRY.  Well,  don’t  just  gloss  over  that.  You  say,  ‘‘Sure. 

Absolutely.’’ I mean, that’s a very fundamental point. 

Mr.  MARTIN.  No,  I  think  it  is,  but  I  also  think  Congress  has 
given  us  that  authority.  And  I  guess  I’m  not  as  deterred,  poten-
tially,  by  the  lawsuit.  Almost  every  action  the  Commission  takes, 
we get taken to court, where someone challenges our authority. 

Senator KERRY. Well, here are the differences—— 
Mr. MARTIN. That’s the reason why I’m probably not as hesitant, 

in that sense.

23 

Senator KERRY. Well, you see, I think what’s happened is, there’s 
a lot, obviously, that’s in a gray area here, that, in effect, the Inter-
net  policy  statement  has  four  fundamental  principles,  which  I 
think  are  good  principles.  I’m  not  arguing  with  them.  In  fact,  they 
are  encompassed  within  the  legislation.  But,  let  me  give  you,  sort 
of,  a  side-by-side  on  them.  Your  principles  that  you  keep  referring 
to  in  the  Internet  policy  statement  are,  ‘‘To  encourage  broadband 
deployment,  preserve  and  promote  the  open  interconnected  nature 
of  the  public  Internet,  consumers  are  entitled  to  access  the  lawful 
Internet  content  of  their  choice.’’  So,  you  have  ‘‘a  content  of  their 
choice.’’ Now, that’s—they’re entitled to it. There’s not a lot of clar-
ity in that. 

In  our  legislation,  we  say,  ‘‘With  respect  to  any  broadband  serv-
ice  offered  to  the  public,  each  broadband  service  provider  shall’’— 
required—‘‘not  block,  interfere  with,  discriminate  against,  impair, 
or  degrade  the  ability  of  any  person  to  use  a  broadband  service  to 
access, use, send, post, receive, or offer any lawful content, applica-
tion,  or  service  made  available  via  the  Internet.’’  Do  you  have  any 
disagreement with that? 

Mr. MARTIN. I think that the only hesitation I have is that, when 
you  say  they’re  not  allowed  to  discriminate,  as  I  said,  there  are 
some  good  techniques,  for  example,  favoring  voice  packets  over 
data packets to make sure that the voice communications can occur 
in  a  realtime  basis.  I  think  that  one  of  the  things  that  I’ve  talked 
about  in  the  past,  that  would  concern  me  is  if  it  were  an  explicit 
requirement that had no flexibility to it. 

Senator KERRY. And you view that as discrimination. But, if you 
were  to  take  out  the  word  ‘‘discriminate’’  or  further  describe  the 
word  ‘‘discriminate’’  adequately,  do  you  have  any  objection  to  that 
fundamental objective of that word? 

Mr. MARTIN. No, I think it’s very similar to our fundamental ob-

jective. 

Senator KERRY. All right. 
The second one you have is that—‘‘Encourage broadband deploy-
ment, preserve, promote the open interconnected nature of the pub-
lic  Internet.  Consumers  are  entitled  to  run  applications  and  use 
services  of  their  choice,  subject  to  the  needs  of  law  enforcement.’’ 
We all agree with that. 

Here’s  paragraph  2  of  the  bill,  ‘‘Shall  not  prevent  or  obstruct  a 
user  from  attaching  or  using  any  device  to  the  network  of  such 
broadband  service  provider  only  if  such  device  does  not  physically 
damage  or  substantially  degrade  the  use  of  such  network  by  other 
subscribers.’’ Do you have an objection to that? 

Mr. MARTIN. Again, I think it’s very similar to what we adopted. 
Senator KERRY. So do I. But, it’s a law. 
Mr. MARTIN. Yes. 
Senator  KERRY.  Third,  ‘‘To  encourage  broadband  deployment, 
preserve and promote the interconnected nature of public Internet, 
consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that 
do not harm the network.’’ That’s part of what we just read. That’s 
number three of yours, correct? 

Mr. MARTIN. That’s correct. 
Senator  KERRY.  Do  you  agree  with  that  in  the  same  paragraph? 
Mr. MARTIN. Of course.

24 

Senator KERRY. Fourth—and these are the only ones you have— 
fourth, ‘‘Internet consumers are entitled to competition among net-
work providers, application and service providers, and content pro-
viders.’’ So, you want competition in the field. So do we. 

We  say,  ‘‘Enable  any  content,  application,  or  service  made  avail-
able  via  the  Internet  to  be  offered,  provided,  or  posted  on  a  basis 
that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, including with respect to 
quality  of  service,  access,  speed,  and  bandwidth;  be  as  at  least 
equivalent  to  the  access  speed,  quality  of  service,  and  bandwidth 
that  such  broadband  service  provider  offers  to  affiliated  content’’— 
in other words, we want fair competition—‘‘applications, or services 
made  available  via  the  public  Internet;  and  (c)  does  not  impose  a 
charge on the basis of the type of content, applications, or services 
made available via the Internet into the network of such broadband 
service  provider.’’  In  other  words,  that’s  real  neutrality;  we’re  not 
going  to  have  a  content  that  starts  playing  games  with  people’s, 
you know, type of content or the application, because that does be-
come discriminatory. 

Now, do you disagree with any of those? 
Mr.  MARTIN.  Again,  it  had  some  of  the  nondiscriminatory  lan-
guage,  and  I  think  that  I’d  have  some  of  the  same  concerns  I  had 
before. 

Senator  KERRY.  Well,  let’s  presume  that  we  could  sharpen  this 

word ‘‘discriminatory’’—— 

tion. 

Mr. MARTIN. Right. 
Senator  KERRY.—so  that  we  understand  exactly  what  we’re  try-
ing  to  prevent,  and  we  don’t  become  inadvertently—the  law  of  un-
intended  consequences—we  don’t  create  something  that,  in  fact,  is 
beneficial to the system, where you’re actually making a choice be-
tween something that everybody would agree, in terms of the provi-
sion  of  service,  is  positive.  It’s  hard  to  see  how  that  would  happen 
and  have  a  free  market  and  be  letting  the  market  decide,  but  as-
sume  we  tried  to  do  that.  Would  you  have  an  objection  with  the 
fundamental direction of that? 

Mr.  MARTIN.  I  don’t  have  an  objection  to  the  fundamental  direc-

Senator KERRY. So—— 
Mr. MARTIN. I have one question about the—part (c), I think you 

said, where they weren’t—— 

Senator KERRY. Yes. 
Mr.  MARTIN.—allowed  to  charge  anything.  I’m  not  sure  I  under-
stood  the  full  implications  of  that.  There  are  providers  today,  not 
even  the  network  providers,  but  some  people  who  host  servers  on 
the edges of the network, for example, to try to increase the speeds 
for  consumers  downloading  information  from  those  servers.  And  I 
don’t think I’d want to limit network operators’, for example, ability 
to  provide  that  same  commercial  service  that  is  being  provided  by 
others today. 

Senator KERRY. We wouldn’t want to do that. I would agree with 
that.  But,  we  also  don’t  want  to  have  a  situation  where  a  network 
provider is creating tiers and actually, you know, preventing people 
from getting access under certain——

25 

Mr.  MARTIN.  Oh,  as  I  said  to  Senator  Dorgan  before,  I  agree.  I 
don’t think they should be able to say to a Google, ‘‘Unless you pay 
me, I’m going to redirect your traffic to Yahoo!’’ I think that’s right. 
Senator  KERRY.  Well,  it  seems  to  me  that  we  ought  to  be  able 
to  skin  this  cat;  I  mean,  we  ought  to  be  able  to  find  a  way  to  deal 
with  this  one  concept,  that  reasonable  people  ought  to  be  able  to 
find  a  way  to  protect  the  public  interest  here  and  to  provide  you 
with  sufficient  clarity  as  to  what  the  congressional  intent  is  and 
what is expected, so that everybody knows what rules we’re playing 
by. 

Right now, if I were in the business, I would be tempted to want 
to  sue  you,  because  there  is  a  discretionary  gray  area,  there’s  a 
complete  lack  of  clarity  as  to  why  you  might  be  deciding  what 
you’re deciding, what you’re basing it on. And in the absence of the 
clarity of that congressional intent, I think we’re inviting delay. 

To  speak  to,  I  think,  Senator  Ensign,  when  I  was  out  of  here, 
mentioned  that  I  had  mentioned  that  the  company  corrected  it. 
Yes,  they  did.  But,  you  want  to  not  have  a  situation  where  you 
have  to  find  an  advocacy  group  that  calls  it  to  our  attention  and 
screams  about  the  unfairness,  and  months  go  by,  and,  after  a 
while,  you  correct  it.  It  would  be  better  for  everybody,  wouldn’t  it, 
if  you  had  that  established  and  clear  and  everybody  knows  where 
the  money  is  going  to  flow,  how  the  capital  is  going  to  be  repaid? 
There’s  a  kind  of  certainty  in  the  marketplace  that  comes  from 
that, isn’t there? 

Mr.  MARTIN.  Oh,  I  agree  that  certainty  about  our  ability  to  en-
force  this  is  only  positive.  As  I  said,  I  think  the  Commission  has 
been  clear  that  we  will  be  enforcing  our  current  principles,  which 
are fundamentally in the same direction. As you said, I think there 
are some issues that reasonable people would continue to work on, 
but  that  even  with  some  differences,  fundamentally  they’re  in  the 
same direction. 

I  think  the  Commission  has  tried  to  provide  the  clarity  that  we 
will enforce it, but I don’t disagree that making sure that the Com-
mission  has  the  authority  is  not,  in  and  of  itself  wrong;  there’s 
nothing  wrong  with  that.  It’s  something  the  Commission  has  al-
ready said that we intend to be doing. 

Senator  KERRY.  Well,  I  congratulate  you  on  that.  I  think  the 
basic  principles  you’ve  laid  out—I  think  they’re  incomplete,  and  I 
don’t think they allow you to go the distance here or to provide the 
marketplace  the  clarity  it  needs  and  deserves.  But,  I  do  think  it’s 
moving in the right direction, and I certainly applaud you for hold-
ing those principles. 

I’d  like  to  see  us,  Mr.  Chairman,  hopefully,  provide  that  clarity 

and that certainty to the marketplace. 

I think we ought to try to find a way to work with you—and I’m 
sure you’re willing to work with us—to, maybe, you know, work on 
how we define that discriminatory concept a little bit more. 

Mr. MARTIN. Thank you. 
Senator KERRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Pryor? 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman  Martin,  let  me  ask—you  mentioned,  in  your  state-
ment,  the  Madison  River  Communications  case.  And  as  I  under-
stand it, you have at least a couple of other matters that have come 
before  you,  and,  I  guess,  are  pending  now.  One  is  Comcast,  where 
they were delaying some messages; I’m not quite sure of all the de-
tails on that. And Verizon apparently—currently has matters pend-
ing  before  your  Commission.  How  is  that  working?  Right  now, 
we’re—you’re doing this on a case-by-case basis. How is that work-
ing? 

Mr.  MARTIN.  Well,  as  I  said,  we’ve  adopted  the  principles  that  I 
was  just  going  through  with  Senator  Kerry,  and  I  believe  that 
we’re enforcing those through an adjudication process. I think that 
is  how  we  would  probably  enforce,  any  kind  of  similar  principles. 
And I think that it, thus far, is working fine. The Commission has 
acted in the past, as I testified to, in the context of stopping a tele-
communications  carrier  from  limiting  the  consumer’s  access  to  a 
Voice-over-IP  service.  I  think  that  we  have,  as  you  said,  two  com-
plaints  with  us  now,  that  I  think  the  Commission  will  take  action 
on, as well. 

Senator PRYOR. Because there’s no statute on this issue, are you 
seeing  companies  trying  to  test  the  water  and  figure  out  what  the 
boundaries are? 

Mr.  MARTIN.  You  know,  we  weren’t.  And,  indeed,  when  the  Su-
preme Court upheld our information service classification, they ex-
plicitly  stated  that  they  believe  we  had  authority  under  Title  I  of 
the  statute,  so  we  had  statutory  authority  to  adopt  any  rules  we 
would deem necessary to adequately protect consumers’ broadband 
access rights. So, I believe we do have that statutory authority. 

Up  until  the  hearing  at  Harvard,  and  Comcast’s  subsequent  let-
ter,  I  don’t  believe  there  had  been  anyone  who  had  asserted  that 
we did not have that authority. 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK.  And  you  mentioned,  you  know,  Madison 
River  and  Comcast  and  Verizon.  Are  you  confident  that  those  are 
the  only  three  companies  out  there  that  are  trying  to  restrict  con-
tent in some way? 

Mr.  MARTIN.  Those  are  the  only  ones  that  have  been  brought  to 
our  attention.  I  believe  Vuze  released  a  press  release  yesterday 
saying  that  they  thought  that  the  equipment  that  was  being  used 
to  block  applications  to  peer-to-peer  by  Comcast  was  also  more 
prevalent  in  the  network.  There  was  an  analysis  done  of  domestic 
networks and of networks abroad. So, that particular practice may 
be  more  prevalent.  We  don’t  have  any  specific  facts  or  allegations 
against another company. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Now,  when  BellSouth  and  AT&T  merged—I 
guess, last year; I don’t remember exactly when that was, the Com-
mission  required  them  to  do  a—what—a  2-year,  I  guess  you  say, 
moratorium, or a 2-year requirement on certain business practices. 
Is that company—is AT&T behaving differently than the rest of the 
market right now? 

Mr.  MARTIN.  Well,  there  are  no  allegations  against  them  right 
now, so we’re not aware of anything that they are doing, and there 
aren’t any allegations that they were, for example, interfering with 
peer-to-peer content or blocking the uploading ability of individuals

using  peer-to-peer,  or  degrading  the  ability  for  someone  to 
download using peer-to-peer. 

Senator PRYOR. Let me ask about investment out there. Because 
I have a lot of rural areas in my State, as do many of the Senators 
here  today,  you  know,  I  know  that  investment—the  money  tends 
to  go  where  the  people  are,  where  the  business  is.  And,  you  know, 
one  of  the  concerns  I  have  is  that  the  investment  in  rural 
broadband  will  not  flow  in  such  a  way  that  rural  broadband  will 
really  have  equal  access  to  more  urban  areas  in  this  country.  Do 
you share that concern? 

Mr. MARTIN. Oh, sure. I think it’s a significant challenge to make 
sure  that  we  have  policies  in  place  that  are  trying  to  ensure  that, 
ultimately,  people  who  live  in  rural  areas  don’t  get  left  behind 
those  that  live  in  urban  areas.  And  I  think  that  that  actually  was 
embodied  in  Congress’s  enactment  of  the  universal  service  provi-
sions of the Telecom Act, where they said that people there should 
be  entitled  to  advanced  services,  ultimately  similar  to  what’s  pro-
vided in urban areas. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Are  there  policies  that  you  need  to  change,  or 
that  the  Congress  needs  to  change,  relating  to  broadband  that 
would allow more investment to flow out to rural America? 

Mr. MARTIN. We’ve tried to change some policies. We actually re-
cently  adopted  provisions  for  gathering  more  information  to  estab-
lish  the  current  floor  of  what  people  have,  very  similar  to  Chair-
man  Inouye’s  bill,  to  try  to  gather  more  information.  We  actually 
also  adopted  rules  recently  to  change  the  definition  of  basic 
broadband  to  increase  the  speed  for  it.  That  was  something  that  I 
voted  for,  along  with  the  two  Democratic  commissioners,  to  in-
crease  the  speed  of  what  constitutes  basic  broadband.  I  think  that 
those  are  important  to  evaluate  where  we  actually  are.  Another 
policy change that I think that we need, and have supported in the 
past,  is  legislation  that  would,  for  example,  remove  some  of  the 
franchising limitations that may have stifled the carrier’s ability to 
invest  in  networks  to  be  able  to  provide  a  competitive  video  alter-
native. Bidding on video services is an important component of that 
infrastructure  investment,  and  I  think  that’s  an  important  policy 
change  that  I’ve  supported  in  the  past,  that  I  think  that  Congress 
could end up doing. 

Senator PRYOR. That’s all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Smith? 
Senator SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
And,  Chairman  Martin,  thank  you  for  being  here.  I—as  I  listen 
to our—my colleagues and our questions to you, it seems like it’s— 
it could easily be framed as those who are for discrimination, those 
who are against discrimination. I don’t really see it that way. What 
I  see  it  as  is  that  we’re  all  pro-deployment  of  more  broadband  to 
urban and rural areas. And as I contemplate how to best encourage 
deployment,  not  just  to  urban  areas,  but  to  rural  areas,  as  well,  I 
can’t  think  of  anything  that  would  be  more  discouraging  to  invest-
ment  in  rural  broadband  deployment  than  if  we  take  a  regulatory 
approach  right  up  front.  My  own  judgment  is  that  if  you  can  pur-
sue the adjudicatory approach swiftly as these cases arise, then we 
will  do—we  will  provide  the  market  certainty  that  Senator  Kerry

28 

is talking about. That’s the objective, as I see it; not whether you’re 
for or against discrimination. We want the Internet to be open. 

Now, I understand that you’re holding several investigative hear-
ings  about  some  complaints  that  occasionally  do  arise.  I’m  not 
going to ask you particulars on that, but you apparently questioned 
a  network  operator  as  to  whether  the  FCC  has  the  authority  to 
pursue  these  investigations,  to  which,  I  believe,  the  response  was, 
no,  you  do  not.  They  later  clarified  their  response,  that  the  Powell 
Principles,  what  I  believe  are  the  floor  of  consumer  rights  on  the 
Internet,  were  simply  a  statement  of  policy  and  not  regulations; 
hence—and hence, not subject to enforcement through, say, injunc-
tions  or  foreclosures.  Now,  I’ve  read  your  statement,  and  I  know 
that  you  disagree  with  the  position  articulated  at  that  field  hear-
ing. My question to you is, Does the FCC have the authority to en-
force  the  Powell  Principles?  Or,  put  another  way,  must  the  Powell 
Principles be codified? 

Mr.  MARTIN.  Well,  I  think  that  we  do  have  the  authority,  and, 
indeed,  the  Commission  has  expressly  stated  that.  Almost  a  year 
ago,  in  April  of  2007,  the  majority  of  the  Commission  very  ex-
pressly stated that we have the authority to both adopt and enforce 
the network neutrality principles it announced in the Internet pol-
icy statement. 

Senator SMITH. Have Federal courts affirmed that? 
Mr. MARTIN. It hasn’t come before the courts—— 
Senator SMITH. Is there litigation heading that way? 
Mr. MARTIN. Well, I think that the concern that has been raised 
is, as a result of Comcast now claiming that we don’t have that au-
thority, will that lead to litigation. As I said, lots of the actions the 
Commission takes end up in the courts, run through litigation, and 
we follow whatever the courts end up clarifying. 

But,  I  believe  that  the  Supreme  Court,  in  its  Brand  X  decision, 
very clearly articulated that we had ancillary authority, under Title 
I of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, to take these actions. 

Senator  SMITH.  On  a  separate  but  related  matter,  you  currently 
have  an  open  proceeding  that  considers  industry  network  manage-
ment practices. It seems that much of the network congestion is de-
rived from massive amounts of illegal print pirated material. I sur-
mise from your statement that narrowly tailored network manage-
ment  practices  designed  to  protect  intellectual  property  is  an  ac-
ceptable  practice  by  network  operators.  Can  you  be  more  specific 
as to what types of network management should be allowed to com-
bat trafficking in illegal materials? 

Mr.  MARTIN.  Well,  there  have  been  several  carriers  who  have 
talked about, and been in discussions with, content providers about 
putting on filters that would distinguish between material that had 
the  appropriate  copyright  and  those  that  didn’t  stop  pirated  con-
tent.  I  think  that’s  fundamentally  different  from  a  network  man-
agement  practice  that  focused  on  a  particular  application,  that  ac-
tually  said,  ‘‘We’re  going  to  stop  this  kind  of  practice,  peer-to-peer 
practice, or more—even more particularly, any kind of peer-to-peer 
using  this  certain  technology.’’  I  think  those  kinds  of  practices 
would be both over- and under-inclusive; it would stop some use of 
that  technology  to  distribute  legal  content,  and  it  wouldn’t  catch 
other technology that was still distributing illegal content.

So, if your goal is to stop pirated content, you would need to put 
some kind of filter on that would try to identify that. Our Internet 
principles  are  only  designed  to  protect  the  access  to  legal  content, 
and that would be a perfectly reasonable kind of network manage-
ment practice. 

Senator SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

STATEMENT OF ROGER F. WICKER, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI 

Senator  WICKER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  will  simply  submit  questions 

for the record and allow you to move on to the next panel. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Without objection. 
Senator Dorgan? 
Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  just  wanted—as  we  allow 
Chairman Martin to leave, I wanted to hold up the two pieces, be-
cause several of us have spoken of this. 

This  is—it  describes  the  docket,  ‘‘The  Internet  policy  statement 
did  not  create  enforceable  rules.’’  This,  from  Comcast  Corporation 
to the FCC, number one. 

Number  two,  again,  comments  about  the  FCC’s  authority,  by 
Comcast,  at  their  filing,  ‘‘The  Commission’s  statutory  authority  to 
regulate  broadband  Internet  services  is  limited.  The  exercise  of 
Title  I  authority  over  network  management  practices  would  also 
constitute  an  abrupt  departure  from  the  Commission’s  numerous 
consistent  and  successful  precedents.  Absent  a  reasoned  expla-
nation  for  its  conduct,  such  a  sharp  departure  from  established 
Commission  policy  would  be  arbitrary  and  capricious,  in  violation 
of the APA.’’ 

The  reason  I  wanted  to  put  that  up  is,  you  know,  the  allegation 
is  made—and  I  understand  this  may  or  may  not  be  right,  but  at 
least  it  creates  the  question  of  uncertainty,  here,  about  whether 
your  principles  are  enforceable  by  you.  I  don’t  know  whether  they 
are  or  not,  but  I  think  most  of  us  would  believe  that,  whether  the 
codification of these principles or the passage of the Internet Free-
dom  Act,  something  is  necessary  to  make  certain  that  we  resolve 
this.  This—I  mean,  you  say  you  have  the  authority,  but  you  may 
well  not  have  the  authority.  You  may  not  find  that  for  years.  You 
may be litigating for a long period of time. 

Chairman Martin, I appreciate your coming. 
And, Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing me to describe what 

we had previously discussed. 

Senator SMITH. Mr. Chairman, if I may respond, I’d be happy to 
introduce  a  bill  with  Senator  Dorgan  to  codify  the  Powell  Prin-
ciples. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Well,  it’s  short  of  what  we  need  to  do,  but  I— 
you know, I think we can talk about that in the context of an Inter-
net freedom bill and other things. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Chairman Martin—— 
Mr. MARTIN. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF MICHELE COMBS, VICE PRESIDENT OF 
COMMUNICATIONS, CHRISTIAN COALITION OF AMERICA 
Ms.  COMBS.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished 
members  of  the  Committee  on  Commerce,  Science,  and  Transpor-
tation.  My  name  is  Michele  Combs,  and  I  am  the  Vice  President 
of  Communications  for  the  Christian  Coalition  of  America.  Thank 
you for inviting me to testify today. 

Use  of  the  Internet  has  allowed  the  Christian  Coalition  to  am-
plify the voices of millions of hardworking pro-family Americans in 
a way that has revolutionized their ability to be heard and engaged 
in  political  process.  Consequently,  the  reason  the  Christian  Coali-
tion  supports  net  neutrality  is  simple.  We  believe  that  organiza-
tions  such  as  the  Christian  Coalition  should  be  able  to  continue  to 
use  the  Internet  to  communicate  with  our  members  and  a  world-
wide  audience  without  a  phone  or  cable  company  snooping  in  our 
communications  and  deciding  whether  to  allow  particular  commu-
nication  to  proceed,  slow  it  down,  block  it,  or  offer  to  speed  it  up 
only if the author pays extra to be on the fast lane. 

Unfortunately, in the last 6 months we have seen network opera-
tors  block  political  speech,  block  content,  and  block  the  most  pop-
ular applications on the Internet. In every instant, the network op-
erators  have  claimed  that  these  actions  were  for  network  manage-
ment purposes. 

As you know, in October 2007 the news organization, Associated 
Press,  reported  that  Comcast  was  blocking  consumers’  ability  to 
download  the  King  James  Bible  using  a  BitTorrent  technology.  It 
has also been pointed out that Comcast’s bad behavior just so hap-
pens to block access to video distribution applications that compete 
with  Comcast’s  own  programming.  If  Comcast  were  to  create  a 
Christian  family  channel,  would  the  FCC  allow  it  to  block  access 
to  a  competing  product  from  the  Christian  Coalition  that  was  dis-
tributed by a BitTorrent application? 

I  have  heard  the  cable  companies  argue  that  network  neutrality 
rules  would  prevent  them  from  protecting  consumers  from  child 
pornography  and  other  illegal  content.  I  am  not  a  network  engi-
neer,  but  it  is  my  understanding  that  every  major  net  neutrality 
proposal would allow the network operators to block illegal content. 
No one I know opposes that. The cable companies’ argument is dis-
ingenuous,  and,  frankly,  it  offends  me,  and  I  respectfully  suggest 
that it ought to offend you. 

Right  now,  the  cable  companies  are  not  subject  to  network  neu-
trality  regulation,  yet  family  groups  continue  to  criticize  the 
amount  of  pornography  that  cable  companies  make  available  on

31 

their  systems,  and  even  profit  from.  Yet,  the  cable  industry  would 
have  us  believe  that  if  you  impose  network  neutrality  rules,  sud-
denly  they’re  going  to  try  and  block  illegal  content,  but  would  be 
hindered.  Let’s  remember,  it  was  the  King  James  Bible  that 
Comcast blocked, which caused the current controversy. 

At  the  FCC  hearing  in  Palo  Alto  last  week,  one  witness  noted 
that  if  Comcast  removed  just  two  pay-per-view  pornography  chan-
nels and allocated that space for the public Internet, it would solve 
their  so-called  bandwidth  problems.  Why  do  you  think  the  pornog-
raphy  industry  has  not  supported  network  neutrality?  Arguably, 
any  unsavory  producer  of  content  should  be  worried  that  its  con-
tent  could  be  disadvantaged  in  a  non-neutral  network.  I  suggest 
that the answer is, the pornography industry knows that it will be 
able to pay premium prices to be on the fast lane, with exceptional 
quality  of  service  provided  by  the  cable  industry.  You  know  who 
won’t  have  the  deep  pockets  to  compete  in  this  non-neutral  world? 
Nonprofit family organizations like the Christian Coalition. 

The  Christian  Coalition  does  not  seek  burdensome  regulations. 
We generally believe that less government is better than more gov-
ernment,  and  we  do  not  believe  that  government  should  censor 
speech.  But,  let’s  be  clear,  right  now  the  telephone  and  cable  com-
panies  are  investing  in  and  using  the  exact  same  censorship  and 
content discrimination technologies that are being used by the Chi-
nese government to censor speech. In fact, the Chinese government 
is  currently  using  the  same  technologies  to  block  the  Christian 
Coalition’s  speech  from  being  received  by  its  citizens.  The  FCC 
should make it clear that it will not allow cable and phone compa-
nies  to  use  these  technologies  to  block  the  lawful  speechwriters  of 
the Christian Coalition and others. 

Increasingly,  faith-based  groups  are  turning  to  the  Internet  to 
promote  their  political  rights  to  engage  in  what  Ronald  Reagan 
called ‘‘the hard work of freedom.’’ We should not let the phone and 
cable  companies  interfere  with  that  work.  We  should  all  try  to 
make the Internet a safe environment for our future, our children, 
and our grandchildren. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. Combs follows:] 

PREPRARED STATEMENT OF MICHELE COMBS, VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, 

CHRISTIAN COALITION OF AMERICA 

Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished  members  of  the  Committee  on 
Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation,  my  name  is  Michele  Combs,  and  I  am  the 
Vice  President  of  Communications  for  the  Christian  Coalition  of  America.  Thank 
you  for  inviting  my  organization  to  testify  at  this  hearing  on  the  ‘‘Future  of  the 
Internet.’’ 

The  Christian  Coalition  of  America  is  the  largest  and  most  active  conservative 
grassroots political organization in the United States. We offer people of faith a ve-
hicle  to  be  actively  involved  in  shaping  their  government.  Christian  Coalition  of 
America  is  a  political  organization,  which  is  made  up  of  pro-family  Americans  who 
care deeply about becoming active citizens for the purpose of guaranteeing that gov-
ernment acts in ways that strengthen, rather than threaten, families. 

Our hallmark work lies in voter education. Prior to the last election, the Christian 
Coalition  of  America  distributed  a  record  70  million  voter  guides  throughout  all  50 
states.  These  non-partisan  guides  gave  voters  a  clear  understanding  of  where  var-
ious  candidates  stood  on  the  issues  important  to  them.  With  this  knowledge,  mil-
lions of voters went to the polls to make their voices heard. 

Use  of  the  Internet  has  allowed  the  Christian  Coalition  to  amplify  the  voices  of 
millions  of  hard-working,  pro-family  Americans  in  a  way  that  has  revolutionized 
their ability to be heard and to engage in the political process.

The  Internet  connects  people  all  over  the  world  in  a  manner,  scope,  and  ease  of 
use  that  would  be  impossible  anywhere  but  online.  It  provides  a  voice  for  even  the 
most  modest  members  of  society  to  disseminate  ideas  on  a  scale  traditionally  re-
served only for the most powerful. 

Consequently,  the  reason  the  Christian  Coalition  supports  Net  Neutrality  is  sim-
ple.  We  believe  that  organizations  such  as  the  Christian  Coalition  should  be  able 
to continue to use the Internet to communicate with our members and with a world-
wide  audience  without  a  phone  or  cable  company  snooping  in  on  our  communica-
tions  and  deciding  whether  to  allow  a  particular  communication  to  proceed,  slow  it 
down,  block  it,  or  offer  to  speed  it  up  if  the  author  pays  extra  to  be  on  the  ‘‘fast 
lane.’’ 

Unfortunately,  in  the  last  6  months,  we  have  seen  network  operators  block  polit-
ical  speech,  block  content,  and  block  the  most  popular  applications  on  the  Internet. 
In  every  instance,  the  network  operators  have  claimed  that  these  actions  were  for 
‘‘network management’’ purposes. 

Verizon  Wireless  Blocking  Political  Speech.  Last  fall,  Verizon  Wireless  censored 
text  messages  sent  by  the  pro-choice  advocacy  group,  NARAL,  to  its  own  members 
who had voluntarily signed up to receive them. When NARAL protested, the phone 
company claimed the right to block any content ‘‘that, in its discretion, may be seen 
as  controversial  or  unsavory.’’  When  this  did  not  satisfy  the  concerned,  Verizon 
Wireless said not to worry, because the company would also block the speech of pro- 
life advocates such as the Christian Coalition. 

After  news  of  Verizon’s  censorship  hit  the  front-page  of  the  New  York  Times— 
sparking a loud public outcry—the company quickly backpedaled, issuing an apology 
and  blaming  the  blocking  on  a  ‘‘dusty  internal  policy,’’—while  still  reserving  the 
right to block text messages in the future at its own discretion. 

AT&T  Blocking  Political  Speech.  In  August  2007,  AT&T  censored  a  webcast  of  a 
concert by the rock band Pearl Jam just as lead singer Eddie Vedder started talking 
about  politics.  The  company  claimed  it  was  a  glitch—as  were  at  least  three  other 
instances when AT&T cutoff political speech during live concerts. 

Comcast Blocking Access to the King James Bible. In October 2007, the news orga-
nization  Associated  Press  reported  that  Comcast  was  blocking  consumers’  ability  to 
download the King James Bible using a popular file-sharing technology. Comcast at 
first  denied  that  it  was  engaging  in  such  discrimination.  After  independent  tests 
confirmed that Comcast was indeed engaging in this behavior, Comcast claimed that 
it was simply conducting routine network management. This ‘‘routine network man-
agement’’  has  launched  two  petitions  at  the  Federal  Communications  Commission, 
a  consumer  complaint  at  the  FCC,  at  least  two  class  action  lawsuits,  an  investiga-
tion  by  a  state  attorney  general,  and  countless  complaints  in  the  blogosphere.  Yet 
Comcast  continues  to  argue  it  has  the  right  to  discriminate  against  such  applica-
tions. It is my understanding that it now argues that the FCC has no legal author-
ity  to  do  anything  about  it.  And,  I  understand  that  some  cable  companies  have  ar-
gued to the FCC that not even Congress has the Constitutional authority to protect 
consumers from such bad behavior. 

It  has  also  been  pointed  out  that  Comcast’s  discriminatory  conduct  just  so  hap-
pens to block access to video distribution applications from companies like Vuze that 
compete with Comcast’s own programming. 

If  Comcast  were  to  create  a  Christian  family  channel,  would  Washington  allow 
it to block access to competing programming distributed through the Christian Coa-
lition website? 

While  the  cable  companies  complain  to  the  FCC  about  their  rights  to  ‘‘manage 
their network’’ without interference, I ask you to consider the speech and commerce 
rights of organizations like the Christian Coalition, NARAL, consumer groups, tech-
nology companies, and millions of users of the Internet. 

I have heard the cable companies argue that network neutrality rules would pre-
vent them from protecting consumers from child pornography and other illegal con-
tent. I am not a network engineer, but it is my understanding that every major net 
neutrality  proposal,  including  legislation  offered  by  Senators  Dorgan  and  Snowe, 
would  allow  the  network  operators  to  block  illegal  content.  No  one  I  know  opposes 
that. 

It seems that the cable companies’ argument that they are merely engaging in ‘‘le-
gitimate  network  management’’  is  disingenuous,  and  frankly  it  offends  me.  And  I 
respectfully suggest that it ought to offend the Committee. 

Right now, the cable companies are not subject to a network neutrality regulation, 
yet family groups continue to criticize the amount of pornography that cable compa-
nies  make  available  on  their  systems  and  even  profit  from.  Yet,  the  cable  industry 
would  have  us  believe  that  if  you  impose  network  neutrality  rules,  it  will  suddenly 
clean up the Internet?

Let’s  remember,  it  was  the  transmitting  of  the  King  James  Bible  that  Comcast 
blocked,  which  caused  the  current  controversy.  It  was  not  as  if  the  company  was 
trying to protect consumers from inappropriate content. 

Why  do  you  think  that  the  pornography  industry  has  not  supported  net  neu-
trality?  Arguably,  any  unsavory  producer  of  content  should  be  worried  that  its  con-
tent  could  be  disadvantaged  in  a  non-neutral  network.  I  suggest  that  the  answer 
is  that  the  pornography  industry  knows  that  it  will  be  able  to  pay  premium  prices 
to  be  on  the  fast  lane  with  exceptional  quality  of  service  provided  by  the  cable  in-
dustry. 

You  know  who  won’t  have  the  deep  pockets  to  compete  in  this  non-neutral  world 

of special deals? Non-profit, family organizations like the Christian Coalition. 

The  Christian  Coalition  does  not  seek  burdensome  regulations.  We  generally  be-
lieve  that  less  government  is  better  than  more  government.  And,  we  do  not  believe 
that governments should censor speech. But let’s be clear. Right now, the telephone 
and cable companies are investing in and using the exact same censorship and con-
tent  discrimination  technologies  that  are  being  used  by  the  Chinese  government  to 
censor speech. 

In  fact,  the  Chinese  government  is  currently  using  these  same  technologies  to 
block the Christian Coalition’s speech from being received by its citizens. The Chris-
tian  Coalition  is  merely  asking  Congress  to  create  simple  rules  of  the  road  that 
make  it  clear  that  it  will  allow  cable  and  phone  companies  to  block  the  lawful 
speech rights of the Christian Coalition and others. 

Increasingly, faith-based groups are turning to the Internet to promote their polit-
ical rights, to engage in what Ronald Reagan called ‘‘the hard work of freedom.’’ We 
should not let the phone and cable companies interfere with that work. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, ma’am.

STATEMENT OF ROBERT W. HAHN, PH.D., EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR REGULATORY AND MARKET 

STUDIES, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE 

Dr.  HAHN.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Inouye  and  Ranking  Member 
Stevens  and  distinguished  Members  of  this  Committee.  I  am 
pleased to appear before you today to present my views on a small 
subject: The Future of the Internet. 

I’m  an  economist  who  has  studied  regulation  for  more  than  25 
years.  I  now  direct  the  AEI-Reg  Markets  Center.  I’ve  also  served 
on the faculties at Harvard and Carnegie Mellon. 

Most  of  you  saw  ‘‘The  Graduate,’’  in  which  Dustin  Hoffman  was 
told,  in  one  word,  the  key  to  the  future:  plastics.  Well,  at  the  risk 
of  making  a  similar  mistake,  I  want  to  leave  you  with  two  words 
today: pricing freedom. 

Let me begin with a fictional story about the importance of ‘‘pric-
ing freedom.’’ Imagine there was a firm named Oogle, and it want-
ed to bring together sellers and consumers on the Net through text 
advertising.  The  only  problem  was  that  Oogle  had  to  figure  out  a 
way to make money to invest the billions needed to bring all these 
folks together and to become a leader in Internet search. 

Oogle’s  insight  was  to  charge  advertisers  a  penny  each  time  a 
consumer  clicked  on  an  Internet  ad,  and  charge  consumers  zero. 
This  was  brilliant,  and  Oogle  revolutionized  the  Internet,  as  we 
know it, and made lots of money. 

But,  now  imagine,  in  the  interest  of  so-called  ‘‘advertiser  neu-
trality,’’  the  advertisers  effectively  lobbied  Congress  to  stop  Oogle 
from  charging  them  and  only  charged  consumers  instead.  Would 
we have the Internet, as we know it? I seriously doubt it. 

Oogle  was  successful,  in  part,  because  it  was  given  the  pricing 
freedom  to  figure  out  what  economic  model  would  work  best  for

consumers,  sellers,  and  itself.  The  same  logic  holds  true  in  the 
world of net neutrality. 

Net  neutrality  is  a  policy  proposal  that  would  regulate  how  net-
work  providers  manage  and  price  the  use  of  their  networks.  While 
the  concept  sounds  great,  I  believe  that  it  is  downright  dangerous. 
Proposed  legislation  would  mandate  that  Internet  service  pro-
viders  exercise  no  control  over  the  content  that  flows  over  their 
lines,  and  would  bar  those  providers  from  charging  content  pro-
viders  for  certain  enhancements,  such  as  priority  delivery,  like 
FedEx  offers.  Applications  ranging  from  telemedicine  to  online 
games could be jeopardized by such regulation. 

The  AEI-Brookings  Joint  Center  issued  a  position  paper  on  net 
neutrality,  signed  by  17  distinguished  economists,  and  I’d  like  to 
discuss two of our recommendations. 

First,  firms  should  be  allowed  to  experiment  with  different  pric-
ing schemes for providing Internet access, just like the hypothetical 
company  Oogle  did.  One  key  advantage  of  giving  Internet  service 
providers  pricing  flexibility  is  that  it  gives  them  an  incentive  to 
lower broadband access prices for consumers, a point several legis-
lators  seem  to  have  missed.  A  second  advantage  is  that  it  gives 
them  an  incentive  to  develop  enhanced  service  offerings  that  will 
enable realtime applications to flourish. 

Our second recommendation was that Congress and Federal reg-
ulators should promote policies that foster Internet innovation. One 
such policy is spectrum liberalization. Highspeed Internet that uses 
wireless  networks  may  be  the  next  big  thing.  The  FCC  should 
make additional licensed spectrum available for flexible use as soon 
as possible so these networks can be improved. 

Both Congress and the FCC should refrain from imposing special 
conditions  on  spectrum  licenses,  such  as  the  recent  openness  re-
quirement  that  was  introduced  in  the  last  FCC  auction.  This  re-
quirement  would  allow  third  parties  with  wireless  applications  to 
piggyback  on  a  licensee’s  network  at  no  charge.  While  openness, 
like  net  neutrality,  may  sound  good,  the  cost  of  mandatory  open-
ness  for  end  users  is  likely  to  be  significant  and  has  never  been 
compared against the benefits. 

My bottom line is that the issues raised in the net neutrality de-
bate can be effectively addressed by allowing Internet pricing free-
dom,  fostering  more  efficient  use  of  spectrum,  and  using  antitrust 
authority where appropriate. 

Allowing  pricing  freedom  is  likely  to  be  the  best  way  to  ensure 

efficient innovation on the information superhighway. 

Thank you very much.

two decades. I also have done a great deal of work on telecommunications and Inter-
net regulation.1 

About  a  decade  ago,  I  helped  organize  a  cooperative  effort  between  the  American 
Enterprise  Institute  and  the  Brookings  Institution  to  study  regulation.  The  result 
was the AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies, which I directed. I now 
direct  the  AEI  Center  for  Regulatory  and  Market  Studies,  which  is  the  successor 
to the Joint Center.2 

A  primary  objective  of  the  center  is  to  hold  lawmakers  and  regulators  more  ac-
countable by providing thoughtful, objective analysis of existing regulatory programs 
and  new  regulatory  proposals.  The  Reg-Markets  Center  and  the  Joint  Center  have 
been at the forefront of outlining principles for improving regulation and enhancing 
economic welfare.3 

In  its  short  history,  the  Internet  has  grown  at  an  astounding  pace.  This  growth 
is seen in the bandwidth consumed by the video sharing site YouTube. By some esti-
mates,  YouTube  consumed  as  much  bandwidth  in  2007  as  the  entire  Internet  com-
bined in 2000! 4 

That growth is expected to continue. Traffic on the Internet is expected to nearly 
double  every  2  years.5 Much  of  this  growth  will  be  driven  by  peer-to-peer  network 
traffic,  which  is  expected  to  quadruple  by  2011.6 Internet  traffic  will  also  continue 
to grow as high-definition video and other traditional commercial video services are 
delivered  via  IP  within  a  single  network.7 Consumer  video  services  are  expected  to 
grow from 18 percent of consumer Internet traffic to 43 percent.8 

Since  I  only  have  5  minutes,  let  me  cut  to  the  chase.  As  America’s  lawmakers, 
you have the ability to dramatically affect the future of Internet growth and innova-
tion. 

That’s both good news and bad news. The good news is that if you choose policies 
wisely, and regulate with a very light hand, we will continue to enjoy the immense 
benefits that this medium has offered all of us. If, on the other, you choose policies 
that dramatically interfere with the workings of the marketplace, you could signifi-
cantly  reduce  the  pace  of  Internet  innovation,  leading  to  losses  for  consumers  that 
could  be  in  the  billions  of  dollars.  Applications  ranging  from  telemedicine  to  online 

views  expressed  in  this  paper  reflect  solely  those  of  the  author  and  do  not  necessarily  reflect 
those of the institutions with which he is affiliated.

games  could  be  jeopardized  by  regulation  that  seeks  to  bar  contracting  for 
prioritized  delivery—a  critical  ingredient  for  these  applications  to  run  effectively. 
Without  the  ability  to  set  prices  freely,  these  applications,  along  with  their  associ-
ated  benefits  for  the  economy,  may  never  be  introduced.  But,  fortunately,  you  have 
the opportunity to make wise choices. 

So  how  to  choose  policies  wisely,  some  of  you  may  ask?  That  is  a  good  question, 
and one that I would like to focus on today. I am an economist, so my basic answer 
is that you need to look carefully at the benefits and costs of various policy interven-
tions,  and  choose  those  for  which  you  believe  the  benefits  are  likely  to  exceed  the 
costs. 

In the interest of time, I would like to focus my remarks on the issue of net neu-
trality.  I  will  conclude  with  a  couple  of  observations  about  the  current  controversy 
over network management, which is related to the net neutrality issue. 
2. Network Neutrality 9 

Network  neutrality  is  a  policy  proposal  that  would,  among  other  things,  regulate 

how network providers manage and price the use of their networks. 

Net  neutrality  proponents  assert  that  if  Internet  service  providers  are  allowed  to 
charge content providers for enhanced service offerings, those content providers that 
cannot  afford  the  ‘‘toll’’  will  be  forced  to  exit—thus  impairing  innovation  at  the 
‘‘edges’’  of  the  Internet.  In  contrast,  net  neutrality  opponents  suggest  that  allowing 
experimentation  with  new  business  models  is  the  key  to:  (1)  Internet  innovation  at 
both the ‘‘core’’ and the ‘‘edge’’ of the network, and (2) the deployment of more intel-
ligent networks needed to handle rapidly growing Internet traffic. 

Congress  has  introduced  several  bills  on  network  neutrality  over  the  last  few 
years.10 Proposed  legislation  generally  would  mandate  that  Internet  service  pro-
viders  exercise  no  control  over  the  content  that  flows  over  their  lines,  and  would 
bar  service  providers  from  charging  content  providers  for  certain  enhancements 
such  as  prioritized  delivery.  For  example,  senators  Byron  Dorgan  and  Olympia 
Snowe  introduced  network  neutrality  legislation  in  2006  and  again  in  2007,  which, 
had  it  passed,  would  have  prevented  any  contracting  between  access  providers  and 
content  providers.11 Several  scholars  have  uncovered  the  unintended  consequences 
of  such  a  prohibition,  including  higher  prices  of  Internet  service  for  end  users  and 
decreased innovation in application markets.12 

These proposals must be considered carefully in light of the underlying economics. 
My  basic  concern  is  that  most  proposals  aimed  at  implementing  net  neutrality  are 
likely to do more harm than good. 
Analysis 

Regulation  of  prices  and  services  has  often  resulted  in  costs  that  exceed  benefits, 
especially in competitive markets. Highly dynamic markets, such as those for high- 
speed  Internet  services,  pose  particular  problems  because  they  change  so  quickly. 
In  such  dynamic  markets,  it  is  difficult  for  regulators  to  determine  appropriate 
prices because technology and consumer demands are difficult to forecast; and intro-
ducing price regulation risks discouraging the healthy process of risk-taking innova-
tion—which is especially important in telecommunications. 

The market for high-speed Internet services, or broadband, is the key concern. Be-
fore  jumping  to  conclusions  about  market  power,  one  should  look  carefully  at  the 
data. And the data suggest that there is robust and growing competition in the mar-
ket  for  highspeed  Internet  services  in  both  the  wireline  and  wireless  space.  Prices 
for  digital  subscriber  line  service  dropped  by  roughly  one-third  between  2001  and 
2006. In the case of cable modem service, the quality-adjusted price declined signifi-
cantly,  as  cable  connection  speeds  increased  significantly  while  prices  held  steady. 
In  March  of  this  year,  the  FCC  reported  that  high-speed  lines  increased  by  22  per-
cent during the first half of 2007, from 82.8 million to 100.9 million lines in service, 
following  a  27  percent  increase,  from  65.3  million  to  82.8  million  lines,  during  the 
second half of 2006.13 Virtually the entire U.S. population lives in a zip code where 
a  high-speed  service  provider  operates,  and  numerous  service  providers  compete  in 
the  major  population  centers.  And  this  is  to  say  nothing  of  the  boom  in  handheld 
devices, like blackberries, that provide wireless access to the net.

In  most,  but  not  all,  cases,  I  believe  these  markets  are  workably  competitive. 
Moreover,  even  if  some  service  providers  could  exercise  some  market  power,  the 
multi-sided nature of the market and the geographic scope of most Internet content 
means  that  they  still  have  powerful  incentives  not  to  block  content.  In  particular, 
providers need content in order to attract subscribers. If a provider restricted access, 
its  product  would  be  less  valuable  and  attract  fewer  subscribers.  The  point  is  that 
even firms with market power in one part of the market will not necessarily be able 
to control content.

I  offer  two  recommendations  related  to  pricing  flexibility  and  facilitating  more 

competition. 

Recommendation  1:  Firms  should  be  allowed  to  experiment  with  different  pricing 

schemes for providing Internet access. 

One advantage of giving Internet service providers pricing flexibility is that it will 
give  them  incentives  to  make  new  investments  in  network  intelligence,  which  will 
support  a  range  of  real-time  applications  from  telemedicine  to  online  games.  With-
out  such  innovations,  these  real-time  applications  may  never  see  the  light  of  day. 
Another  advantage  of  pricing  freedom  is  that  it  can  lead  to  lower  subscription 
prices for end users. Most economic models of ‘‘two-sided platforms’’ show that plat-
form owners have strong incentives to subsidize the most price-sensitive customers, 
which in this case would be end users. 

There is not one right way to charge different customers in these high-speed mar-
kets. That is precisely why broadband providers should be allowed to charge market 
prices on both sides of the market, unless there is a clear showing that the optimal 
pricing policy from the perspective of platform owners is not consistent with the so-
cially optimal pricing policy. Not only do we lack empirical proof of this proposition, 
there does not appear to be any theoretical basis. 

Recommendation 2: Congress and Federal regulators should promote policies that 
increase  the  opportunities  for  competition  and  foster  Internet  innovation.  One  such 
policy would be spectrum liberalization. 

High-speed  Internet  connections  may  be  provided  using  wireless  networks.  Much 
valuable  spectrum,  however,  is  not  available  for  its  most  productive  uses.  The  Fed-
eral  Communications  Commission  should  make  additional  licensed  spectrum  avail-
able  for  flexible  use  as  soon  as  possible  and  allow  it  to  be  traded  so  that  spectrum 
can be allocated to its highest-valued applications.14 

Both  Congress  and  the  FCC  should  refrain  from  imposing  special  conditions  on 
spectrum  licenses,  such  as  the  recent  openness  requirement  that  was  introduced  in 
the  last  FCC  spectrum  auction  for  certain  licenses.  This  requirement  would  allow 
third-parties with wireless applications to piggyback on the licensee’s network at no 
charge.  While  openness  may  sound  good,  the  cost  of  mandatory  openness  is  signifi-
cant, and to this day, has never been compared against the benefits. 

One  measure  of  the  size  of  the  costs  imposed  by  an  open-platform  requirement 
is  provided  by  the  recent  FCC  spectrum  auction  itself.  Bidders  offered  less  for  the 
C-block  than  for  other,  roughly  comparable  spectrum.  Indeed,  one  other  block  went 
for  almost  triple  the  price  per  potential  customer.15 Multiplying  these  price  dif-
ferences  by  the  population  in  the  United  States  (286  million)  and  the  size  of  the  C 
block (22 megahertz), we can infer that bidders estimated that the openness require-
ment would reduce the value of the C block by between $2.5 billion and $12 billion. 
That  lower  value  translates  into  lower  auction  revenue,  which  from  a  pure  budg-
etary perspective, is not good news for taxpayers. 
3. Network Management 

The issue of managing high-speed Internet networks has been in the news lately. 
Congressman  Ed  Markey  introduced  the  ‘‘Internet  Freedom  Preservation  Act  of 
2008.’’ 16 At  about  the  same  time,  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  held 
hearings at Harvard to consider whether network management practices of Internet 
providers should be regulated in some way. The Commission released a policy state-
ment promoting open access to the Internet. The policymakes an exception for ‘‘rea-
sonable’’  network  management,  but  does  not  define  what  is  meant  by  reasonable. 
A key catalyst for the interest in this seemingly arcane subject is the recent con-
troversy stemming from Comcast’s decision to limit its customers’ use of BitTorrent, 

14 See Bailey et al., supra note 1. 
15 Spectrum  in  the  A  block  sold  for  about  $0.40  per  ‘‘megahertz-pop’’  (a  measure  of  spectrum 
quantity adjusted for the potential population it can serve) than spectrum in the C block. Simi-
larly, B-block spectrum sold for an average of $1.91 more. 

16 See  Robert  Hahn,  The  Internet  Freedom  Act  (Reg-Markets  Center,  Policy  Matters  No.  08– 

03, 2008) for an analysis of this proposal.

a  file-sharing  application.  Most  scholars  agree  that  a  firm  like  Comcast  should  not 
be allowed to simply disconnect a user from the network, or slow the delivery of con-
tent, unless the firm and user agreed to those contract terms upfront. 

But  a  funny  thing  happened  recently  in  this  controversy  that  should  give  law-
makers  and  regulators  reason  for  optimism  in  the  marketplace.  That  funny  thing 
was  that  Comcast  and  BitTorrent  came  to  an  agreement.  Comcast  also  reached  an 
agreement with Pando Networks, the leading managed peer-to-peer content delivery 
service, which will lead to the creation of a peer-to-peer ‘‘Bill of Rights and Respon-
sibilities’’  for  peer-to-peer  users  and  Internet  service  providers.  Such  agreements 
provide a path for resolving thorny network management issues in a voluntary and 
collaborative market-driven process. 
Conclusion 

The  issues  raised  in  the  net  neutrality  and  network  management  debates  can  be 
effectively addressed by using antitrust authority where appropriate, allowing Inter-
net pricing flexibility, and fostering more efficient use of spectrum to facilitate entry 
into the broadband market. 

My  basic  message  is  that  government  should  allow  firms  to  experiment  with  dif-
ferent business models for Internet services. Allowing such market flexibility is like-
ly  to  be  the  best  way  to  ensure  efficient  innovation  on  the  information  super-
highway. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Dr. Hahn. 
And now may I call upon Mr. Verrone. 

STATEMENT OF PATRIC M. VERRONE, PRESIDENT, 

WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA, WEST 

Mr. VERRONE. Thank you, Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Ste-
vens,  members  of  the  Committee,  all  of  you.  My  name  is  Patric 
Verrone. I am the President of the Writers Guild of America, West. 
We  represent  nearly  8,000  writers  of  motion  pictures,  broadcast 
and cable television shows, and, as of a few weeks ago, new media. 
And  the  question  is  asked,  ‘‘Who  writes  this  stuff?’’  the  answer  is, 
for better or for worse, ‘‘We do,’’ including ‘‘The Graduate.’’ 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  VERRONE.  I  had  hoped  to  bring  some  of  the  Southern  Cali-
fornia weather with me, but it appears its flight was delayed. This 
is not a problem for today’s hearing. 

We  are  here  to  talk  about  the  subject  of  the  future  of  the  Inter-
net.  As  you  know,  we  at  the  Writers  Guild  recently  completely  a 
100-day  strike  over  the  place  of  entertainment  writers  in  that  fu-
ture. Also, I believe, I am the only panelists to have written a fea-
ture  film  scrip  about  a  robot  poker  tournament  in  space  Vegas  in 
the year 3009, so I think my expertise on the future is unquestion-
able. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  VERRONE.  Future  of  the  Internet—thank  you  for  laughing— 
the  future  of  the  Internet  is  a  cautionary  tale.  I  begin  by  invoking 
the  Ghost  of  New  Media  Past.  It  is,  of  course,  April,  so,  naturally, 
Dickens’ ‘‘Christmas Carol’’ comes to mind. 

A  hundred  years  ago,  new  media  was  motion  pictures;  75  years 
ago, radio; 50 years ago, it was broadcast television. I started work-
ing  in  the  entertainment  industry  about  22  years  ago,  writing  for 
Johnny  Carson.  And,  like  other  7-year-olds  at  the  time,  I  saw  al-
most  30  separate  companies  independently  producing  and  distrib-
uting  television  on  the  new  media  of  cable  TV.  Yet,  today  we  are 
down  to  about  seven  vertically  integrated  conglomerates  control-
ling, not only cable TV, but also broadcast TV, film, radio, and even 
the  news.  Concentration  of  power  was  triggered  by  a  series  of  pol-

icy choices; most recently, about 15 years ago, when the FCC began 
a process of unraveling the financial and syndication rules of FIN– 
SYN,  allowing  production  and  distribution  to  be  jointly  owned.  As 
a  result,  media  companies  have  consolidated,  conglomerated,  and 
congealed  into  a  handful  of  multinational  entities  that  today  em-
ploy nearly everyone working in our industry. 

The  axiom  in  Hollywood  is  that  content  is  king,  but  those  who 
control  access  to  the  king  control  the  kingdom.  Because  of  Federal 
regulations,  or  lack  thereof,  that  control  is  in  the  hands  of  neither 
the  consumer-viewer  nor  the  content  creators,  but,  rather,  the  dis-
tributors. 

Which bring us to the Ghost of New Media Present; namely, the 
Internet.  The  jurisdiction  and  compensation  for  our  content  on  the 
Internet was what we fought for and won in our recent strike. But, 
what  was  most  notable  about  the  strike  was  not  what  we  won; 
rather,  how  we  won  it.  We  used  the  Internet  to  win  the  Internet. 
When  traditional  media  is  in  the  hands  of  the  same  corporations 
that employ you, it’s a little hard to get your message out. We had 
4,000-person  rallies  that  got  less  and  later  coverage  on  the  local 
news than a dog wedding. 

As  such,  the  Internet  proved  to  be  a  powerful  tool  for  commu-
nication. E-mails, blogs, Websites, podcasts, video clips were passed 
along  the  Net,  giving  our  members  updates  and  informing  the 
world  about  our  cause.  In  an  era  of  so-called  ‘‘reality  television’’ 
and  user-generated  content,  the  studios  had  hoped  to  show  that 
they  could  create  programming  without  writers,  yet  the  strike 
proved that we could use the Internet to create programming with-
out the studios. 

The  Internet  holds  incredible  potential  to  resurrect  a  vibrant  in-
dustry of independent creators with free access to, and distribution 
of, democratic, with a small ‘‘d,’’ content. 

And  so,  we  look  to  the  Ghost  of  New  Media  Future.  Will  the 
Internet’s open and free-speech forum be turned into a walled gar-
den  of  content  control?  Will  entertainment  information  and  mar-
keting platforms be available to all, or just to those who can afford 
to  pay  for  them?  Will  the  new  media  be  dominated  by  the  gate-
keepers  that  dominated  the  old  media,  be  they  multinational 
monopsonies of TV and film or regional duopolies of cable and tele-
vision service? Stay tuned. Hopefully, there is a happy ending, one 
which  is  open  to  diverse,  independent,  and  original  voices  and  vi-
sions,  where  consumers  can  pick  and  choose  for  themselves  the 
content  and  services  they  want,  where  content  is  king,  and  the 
king roams free. 

This  future,  we  believe,  relies  on  net  neutrality.  The  policy  deci-
sions  that  triggered  the  consolidation  of  old  media  have  not  yet 
been  made  for  new  media.  There  is  still  time  to  protect  the  rights 
of content producers and consumers. We need to dethrone the gate-
keepers and once more make content king. 

We,  at  the  Writers  Guild,  West,  believe  that  the  Internet  Free-
dom  Preservation  Act  ensures  that  future.  We  support  it.  We  also 
support  public  investment  in  the  broadband  networks.  The  show 
must go on, and it must be taken on the road. 

In an industry filled with oxymoron, from jumbo shrimp to Holly-

wood accounting, we believe we must win a fight for neutrality.

I  will  reserve  the  rest  of  my  time  if  any  of  you  have  any  screen 

plays that you’d like me to read. 

[Laughter.] 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Verrone follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PATRIC M. VERRONE, PRESIDENT, 

WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA, WEST 

Thank  you  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  and  members  of  the  Com-

mittee. 

My  name  is  Patric  M.  Verrone,  and  I  am  the  President  of  the  Writers  Guild  of 
America, West. We represent nearly 8,000 writers of motion pictures, broadcast and 
cable television shows, and, as of a few weeks ago, new media. 

Thank you for inviting me to speak on the subject of ‘‘The Future of the Internet.’’ 
As  you  know,  we  recently  completed  a  100-day  strike  over  the  place  of  entertain-
ment  writers  in  that  future.  Also,  I  believe  I  am  the  only  panelist  to  have  written 
a  film  about  a  robot  poker  tournament  in  space  Vegas  in  the  year  3009  so  I  think 
my expertise in the area is unquestionable. 

The  future  of  the  Internet  is  a  cautionary  tale.  I  begin  by  invoking  the  ghost  of 
new  media  past.  A  hundred  years  ago,  that  was  motion  pictures.  Fifty  years  ago, 
it was broadcast television. 

I started working in the entertainment industry 22 years ago. Almost thirty sepa-
rate  companies  independently  produced  and  distributed  television  on  the  ‘‘new 
media’’  of  cable  TV.  Today  we  are  down  to  about  seven  vertically  integrated  con-
glomerates,  controlling  not  only  cable  TV,  but  also  broadcast,  film,  and  even  news. 
This concentration of power was triggered by a policy choice. About 15 years ago, 
the fcc began the process of unraveling the financial and syndication rules (or FIN– 
SYN) allowing production and distribution to be jointly owned. 

As a result, media companies consolidated, conglomerated, and congealed into the 
handful of multinational entities that today employ nearly everyone working in our 
industry and decimating independent production and content diversity. 

The  axiom  in  hollywood  is  that  ‘‘content  is  king’’  but  those  who  control  access  to 
the king, control the kingdom. Because of Federal regulations—or lack thereof—that 
control  is  in  the  hands  of  neither  the  consumer  nor  the  content  creators,  but  the 
distributors. 

This brings us to new media present—namely, the Internet. 
Jurisdiction and compensation for our content on the Internet was what we fought 
for—and won—in our strike. What was most notable about our strike was not what 
we won, but how we won. 

We used the Internet to win the Internet. 
When traditional media is in the hands of the same corporations that employ you, 
it’s  hard  to  get  your  message  out.  We  had  four  thousand  attend  rallies  that  got 
less—and later—coverage on the local news than a dog wedding. 

As  such,  the  Internet  proved  to  be  a  powerful  tool  for  communication.  E-mails, 
blogs,  websites,  podcasts,  and  video  clips  were  passed  along  on  the  net,  giving  our 
members updates and informing the world about our cause. 

Through  the  ‘‘speechless’’  campaign,  a  series  of  online  videos  in  which  no  words 

were spoken, the public saw the crucial role writers play in media creation. 

In  an  era  of  so-called  reality  television  and  user-generated  content,  the  studios 
hoped  to  show  that  they  could  create  programming  without  writers,  but  the  strike 
proved only the opposite: that writers could create programming without studios. 

The  Internet  holds  incredible  potential  to  resurrect  a  vibrant  industry  of  inde-
pendent  creators  with  free  access  to,  and  distribution  of,  democratic  (with  a  small 
d) content. 

And so we look to the new media of the future. 
Will  the  Internet’s  open  and  free  speech  forum  be  turned  it  into  a  walled  garden 
of  content  control?  Will  entertainment,  information,  and  marketing  platforms  be 
available  to  all  or  just  those  who  can  afford  to  pay  for  them?  Will  the  new  media 
be  dominated  by  the  gate  keepers  that  dominate  the  old  media  (be  they  multi-
national  monopsonies  of  TV  and  film  or  regional  duopolies  of  cable  and  telephone 
service)? 

Thankfully, there is a happier ending. One which is open to diverse, independent, 
and  original  voices  and  visions.  Where  consumers  can  pick  and  choose  for  them-
selves  the  content  and  services  they  want.  Where  content  is  king,  and  the  king 
roams free. 

But this future relies on ‘‘net neutrality.’’

The policy decision that triggered the consolidation of old media has not yet been 
made  for  new  media.  There  is  still  time  to  protect  the  rights  of  content  producers 
and  consumers.  We  need  to  establish  clear  net  neutrality  rules  to  ensure  that  the 
Internet remains a level playing field for all. We dethrone the gatekeepers and once 
more make content king. 

We  at  the  writers  guild  west  believe  that  the  Internet  freedom  and  preservation 

act ensures that future and we support it. 

In an industry filled with oxymorons from jumbo shrimp to Hollywood accounting, 

we must win the ‘‘fight for neutrality.’’ 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
Now may I recognize Ms. Bateman. 

STATEMENT OF JUSTINE BATEMAN, ACTRESS, WRITER, 

PRODUCER AND CO-FOUNDER, FM78.tv 

Ms. BATEMAN. Thank you, Chairman Inouye, Vice Chair Stevens, 
and other members of the Committee. I want to thank you for your 
service  to  this  country,  first  of  all,  and  I’m  honored  to  be  asked  to 
testify today. 

Net neutrality and an open online marketplace are critical to the 
future  of  the  Internet  and  to  the  preservation  of  our  rights.  My 
name  is  Justine  Bateman,  and  I  am  an  actress,  writer,  and  pro-
ducer. I’ve acted in many projects, from TV’s ‘‘Family Ties’’ to, more 
recently,  ‘‘Desperate  Housewives,’’  and  am  a  founding  partner  of 
FM78.TV, a new online media venture. 

When  I  started  acting,  in  the  early  1980s,  creativity  in  TV  and 
film  was  still  rampant,  and  the  innovation  of  ideas  and  perform-
ance  were  exalted.  The  demise  of  this  creative  setting  is  directly 
proportional  to  the  increase  of  media  consolidation,  which  is,  in 
large part, due to the repeal of the financial interests and syndica-
tion rules. Now we have too many executives, too many notes, until 
there is no artistic voice, no point of view, and little entertainment 
value  left  in  the  projects  we  work  on.  On  top  of  this,  there  are 
fewer jobs. 

In  today’s  TV  market,  a  show  like  ‘‘Family  Ties’’  would  never 
make  it  to  TV.  Media  companies  not  only  have  a  monopoly  over 
distribution,  but  they  insist  on  ownership  and  control  of  content 
which  strongly  interferes  with  the  production  of  high-quality  cre-
ative product. 

Corporate  consolidation  has  actually  pushed  the  audience  away 
from the traditional media outlets and driven them to the Internet 
and  videogaming  world.  In  May  2007,  the  online  video  market 
reached  8  billion  streams.  Download  revenue  from  TV  and  film  is 
expected to reach $3 billion in 2010. And gaming reported a $17.9- 
billion  revenue  in  2007.  This  is  why,  a  few  months  ago,  I,  along 
with  three  other  content  creators,  started  FM78.TV  to  make  and 
distribute  professional  high-quality  content  directly  for  the  Inter-
net. We hope we can find a faithful audience online, as other Inter-
net  innovators  have,  and  not  be  stymied  by  a  private  taxation,  if 
you will, by the telecom companies. 

The  Internet  has  been  defined  by  innovation.  The  Internet  itself 
was  a  product  of  American  innovation.  Google  was  created,  as  has 
been  said,  in  a  garage,  by  two  college  students;  eBay  was  created 
by  a  hobbyist.  How  successful  might  those  two  sites  have  been 
without the freedoms we enjoy on the Internet today?

In  entertainment,  I  believe  we’re  on  the  verge  of  a  creative  ren-
aissance,  and  the  Internet  is  the  grid  upon  which  the  renaissance 
can  rest,  because,  unfortunately,  the  business  grid  of  TV  and  film 
today  cannot  support  that.  Traditional  media  is  now  like  a  swim-
ming  pool  over  which  a  pool  cover  has  been  placed,  causing  those 
wild  ducks  that  used  to  swim  around  at  night  in  your  pool  to  go 
elsewhere. And that’s a true story about my pool, and I’m sorry we 
don’t  see  those  ducks  anymore.  Those  ducks,  I’m  sure,  have  now 
found  an  open  body  of  water  in  which  to  swim,  much  like  we  con-
tent creators have found open distribution on the Internet. And the 
idea  of  your  site  succeeding  or  failing  being  based  on  whether  or 
not  you  pay  the  telecom  companies  enough  to  carry  your  material 
or to allow quick access is appalling. And, honestly, I can’t help but 
think of extortion when I imagine that kind of arrangement. 

Net neutrality will allow for we, creators, to continue owning and 
controlling our content in a way we have not been able to since the 
repeal  of  the  financial  and  syndication  rules  of  our  industry.  A 
whole  new  class  of  small-business  owners  will  emerge,  providing 
thousands of new jobs in a sector that desperately needs them. And 
with  innovation  comes  competition,  and  net  neutrality  would  en-
sure a level playing field for that. 

I’ve  heard  the  arguments  against  net  neutrality.  First  and  fore-
most, I do not believe that net neutrality is government regulation. 
By requiring the telecom companies to allow access and to not dis-
criminate  against  any  legal  content  on  the  Internet,  the  govern-
ment  is  clearly  stating  its  intention  for  all  Americans  to  continue 
to freely access content on the Web. 

And,  second,  piracy  is  obviously  a  major  problem  around  the 
world.  And,  of  course,  the  Internet  has  exacerbated  the  problem  of 
illegal downloading. I applaud the work of the MPAA, the copyright 
allowance,  and  others  to  ensure  creators  are  protected.  I  under-
stand  the  threat  of  piracy,  that  the  content  I  create  can  be  stolen. 
All  new-content  creators  understand  this.  But,  the  solution  is  not 
in  establishing  new  rules  that  may  prevent  me  from  competing  at 
all.  Instead,  let  the  market  continue  to  find  solutions,  such  as  dig-
ital  watermarking,  and  define  ways  to  generate  income  from  spon-
sors that decrease the financial problems of piracy, but does not re-
strict competition. 

In  conclusion,  I  want  to  tell  you,  I  am  a  big  fan  of  capitalism. 
I  know  these  companies  here  want  to  make  money,  as  do  I.  They 
are, after all, being responsive to their stockholders and their inter-
ests.  But,  trying  to  restrict  Internet—constrict  Internet  access,  I 
don’t believe that’s a viable revenue option. 

And,  frankly,  not  to  steal  any  thunder  from  the  Christian  Coali-
tion, but the idea of these corporations coming together to attempt 
to  constrict  access  reminds  me  of  the  story  of  the  Tower  of  Babel, 
where  large  forces  conspired  to  unite  and  do  what  they  pleased. 
The fear was that ‘‘now nothing they propose to do will be withheld 
from them.’’ Well, we know how that story ended. 

Frankly, I don’t believe for a second, that any on this Committee 
really, truly want to block or constrict the flow of information, edu-
cation,  or  creativity  to  the  American  people.  And  I  hope  your  sup-
port  of  net  neutrality  will  dramatically  illustrate  to  the  American 
public your continued support of their freedoms.

My  name  is  Justine  Bateman  and  I’m  an  Actress,  Writer,  and  Producer.  I  have 
acted in many projects, from TV’s ‘‘Family Ties’ to more recently, ‘‘Desperate House-
wives,’’ and I am a founding partner of FM78.tv, a new on-line media venture. 

When I started acting in the early 1980s creativity in TV and film was still ramp-
ant  and  innovation  of  ideas  and  performance  were  exalted.  The  demise  of  this  cre-
ative  setting  is  directly  proportional  to  the  increase  of  media  consolidation,  which 
is in large part due to the repeal of the financial interest and syndication rules. Now 
we  have  too  many  executives  and  too  many  notes  given  until  there  is  no  artistic 
voice,  no  point  of  view,  and  little  entertainment  value  left  in  the  projects  we  work 
on.  On  top  of  this  there  are  fewer  jobs.  In  today’s  TV  market  a  show  like  Family 
Ties,  may  never  make  it  to  TV.  Media  companies  not  only  have  a  monopoly  over 
distribution,  they  then  insist  on  ownership  and  control  of  content  which  strongly 
interferes with the production of hi-quality, creative product. 

Corporate  consolidation  has  actually  pushed  the  audience  away  from  the  tradi-
tional  media  outlets  and  driven  them  to  the  Internet  and  video  gaming  world.  In 
May  2007,  the  online  video  market  reached  8  billion  streams.  Download  revenue 
from TV and film is expected to reach $3 billion by 2010. And gaming has reported 
a $17.9 billion in revenue for 2007. 

That is why a few months ago, I, along with three other content creators, started 
FM78.tv—to  make  and  distribute  professional,  high-quality  content  directly  for  the 
Internet.  We  hope  we  can  find  a  faithful  audience  on-line  as  other  Internet 
innovators have and not be stymied by a private taxation, if you will, by the telecom 
companies.  The  Internet  has  been  defined  by  innovation;  the  Internet  itself  was  a 
product of American innovation. Google was created in a garage by two college stu-
dents.  EBay  was  created  by  a  hobbyist.  How  successful  might  those  two  sites  have 
been without the freedoms we enjoy on the Internet today? 

In entertainment, I believe we are on the verge of a creative renaissance and the 
Internet  is  the  new  grid  upon  which  this  renaissance  can  rest,  because  unfortu-
nately  the  business  grid  of  TV  and  film  today  cannot  support  that.  Traditional 
media is now like a pool over which a pool cover has been placed causing those wild 
ducks that used to swim around in your pool to go elsewhere. (True story about my 
pool.  I’m  sorry  we  don’t  see  those  ducks  anymore.)  Those  ducks  now  I’m  sure  have 
found an open body of water in which to swim, much like we content creators have 
been  found  open  distribution  on  the  Internet.  And  the  idea  of  your  site  succeeding 
or  failing  based  upon  whether  or  not  you  paid  the  telecom  companies  enough  to 
carry  your  material  or  allow  quick  access  is  appalling.  Honestly,  I  can’t  help  but 
think of extortion when I imagine that kind of arrangement. 

Net  neutrality  will  allow  for  we  creators  to  continue  owning  and  controlling  our 
content in a way that we have not been able to since the repeal of the financial and 
syndication  rules.  A  whole  new  class  of  small  business  owners  will  emerge,  pro-
viding thousands of new jobs in a sector that desperately needs them. And with in-
novation  comes  competition.  Net  neutrality  would  insure  a  level  playing  field  for 
that. 

I have heard the arguments against net neutrality. 
First  and  foremost,  net  neutrality  is  NOT  government  regulation.  By  requiring 
the telecom companies to allow access and to not discriminate against any legal con-
tent  on  the  Internet,  the  government  is  clearly  stating  its  intention  for  all  Ameri-
cans to continue to freely access content on the Web. 

Secondly, piracy is obviously a major problem around the world and of course the 
Internet has exacerbated the problem of illegal downloading. I applaud the work of 
the MPAA, the Copyright Alliance and others to insure creators are protected. 

I understand the threat of piracy; that the content I create can be stolen. All new 
content creators understand this. But the solution is not establishing new rules that 
may prevent me from competing at all.

Instead,  let  the  market  continue  to  find  solutions,  such  as  digital  watermarking, 
and to find ways to generate income from sponsors that decrease the financial prob-
lems of piracy but does not restrict competition. 

In  conclusion,  I  want  to  tell  you  that  I  am  a  big  fan  of  capitalism.  I  know  these 
companies  here  want  to  make  money,  as  do  I.  They  are  after  all  being  responsive 
to  their  stockholders  and  their  interests.  But  trying  to  constrict  Internet  access?  I 
don’t  believe  that  that  is  a  viable  revenue  option.  Frankly,  and  not  to  steal  any 
thunder from the Christian Coalition, but the idea of these Corporations coming to-
gether to constrict access reminds me of the story of the Tower of Babel where large 
forces conspired to unite and to do what they pleased. The fear was that ‘‘now noth-
ing  they  propose  to  do  will  be  withheld  from  them.’’  (Gen  11:4).  Well,  we  all  know 
how  that  story  ended.  Finally,  I  don’t  believe  for  a  second  that  any  of  you  want  to 
block  or  constrict  the  flow  of  information,  education,  or  creativity  to  the  American 
people  and  I  hope  your  support  of  net  neutrality  will  dramatically  illustrate  to  the 
American  public  your  continued  support  of  their  freedoms.  Thank  you  very  much 
for your time and for the honor of addressing you all. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Ms. Bateman. 
Mr. McSlarrow? 

STATEMENT OF KYLE MCSLARROW, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 
NATIONAL CABLE & TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION 
Mr.  MCSLARROW.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished 

members of the Committee. 

We’ve  heard  from  several  representatives  of  the  content  commu-
nity,  or  those  whose  voices  want  to  be  heard.  And  I  want  to  come 
back  to  that  in  a  second.  But,  I  do  think,  as  many  members  have 
said  in  their  opening  statements,  it’s  important  to  think  about  all 
of this from the perspective of the consumer. 

When a consumer sits down in front of a computer and turns on 
their  broadband  service,  what  is  it  they  actually  experience,  and 
what  have  they  experienced  over  the  last  5  years?  Over  the  last  5 
years, they sit down, it’s always on, they have an increasing array 
of Websites, they have blog sites, they have social networking sites, 
they  have  all  kinds  of  applications—obviously,  we’ve  talked  about 
Google a number of times today—search engines, applications that 
people  didn’t  even  dream  about.  And  when  they  sit  down  at  that 
computer,  it  all  just  works.  It’s  always  on.  It’s  there.  People  love 
their broadband service. 

On the other side of that computer, it’s the Wild, Wild West. You 
have  spam,  viruses,  denial-of-service  attacks.  One  my  larger  mem-
bers  defeats,  every  2  days,  a  billion  spam  e-mails.  And  one  of  my 
smaller  operators  does  a  billion  each  month.  You’ve  got  the  prob-
lem, in certain areas of networks, where just a very few people are 
consuming  such  enormous  amounts  of  bandwidth  that  it’s  actually 
slowing  down  the  system  for  the  vast  majority  of  users.  And  it’s  a 
small  enough  number  sometimes  that  network  operators  are  actu-
ally  on  a  first-name  basis  with  these  folks.  You’ve  got  the  emer-
gence  of  peer-to-peer  traffic,  which—as  I’ve  said  previously,  tech-
nology  is  agnostic;  it’s  not  bad  or  good,  it’s  the  uses  to  which  you 
put  it.  Peer-to-peer  is  often  used  by  many  of  my  companies  who 
partner  with  peer-to-peer,  but  it’s  also  an  emerging  engineering 
challenge that people are only coming to grips with, and you’ve got 
every  network  operator  in  the  country—phone  companies,  cable 
companies,  wireless  operators—who  are  trying  to  manage  conges-
tion  on  the  network,  and  trying  to  manage,  particularly,  peak  con-
gestion.

Now, I said I would come back to the idea of the voices that want 
to  be  heard.  And,  with  all  due  respect,  I’ve  heard  many  state-
ments—some  today,  and  others  before  this  hearing—that  describe 
a  world  that  is  a  complete  fantasy.  Every  single  person  here  has 
a  blog  or  a  Website  or  has  content  that  has  distribution  and  has 
enabled consumers, millions of them around this country, to enable 
that  content.  And  no  one  is  blocking  them.  The  cable  industry  in-
vested  over  $100  billion  to  provide  this  country’s  first  nationwide 
broadband  system.  We  are  in  front  of  92  percent  of  American 
households. They don’t all take it, but it’s there. 

We want as much content, we want as many applications to suc-
ceed  as  possible.  That’s  what  makes  our  broadband  service  attrac-
tive  to  consumers.  And  if  we  ever  engaged  in  conduct  that  con-
sumers  were  outraged  about,  they  do  have  a  choice:  they  can  go 
somewhere  else.  There’s  at  least  a  phone  company,  and  usually 
there’s a satellite provider, and now, with the spectrum being auc-
tioned,  there’s  going  to  be  emerging  wireless  broadband  services. 
We all know this. 

At  bottom,  the  debate  that  we’ve  had  today  has  been  about 
whether  or  not  network  management,  per  se,  is  some  nefarious 
practice that has anticompetitive overtones. First of all, let me just 
say, there is not just a little or a modest amount, there is zero evi-
dence  that  any  operator  is  engaging  in  anticompetitive  conduct. 
The case just hasn’t been made. 

You can criticize, justly—and lots of people have—whether or not 
the network management techniques used today are the best ones. 
I  think  that’s  fine.  I’m  not  the  least  defensive  about  it.  And  I 
should  note  that  many  telephone/cable  operators,  Internet  applica-
tions,  providers,  peer-to-peer  networks  are  coming  together  to  try 
to see whether or not there are better ways of: (a) providing disclo-
sure  to  consumers,  and  (b)  developing  new  techniques.  That’s  all 
good. But, that’s all taking place in the marketplace. 

So,  at  bottom,  I  don’t  think  there’s  a  problem.  I  think  this  com-
mittee  is  absolutely  right  to  continue  exercising  oversight.  Shining 
a  spotlight  on  this  is  a  good  thing.  But,  I  don’t  think  we’re  at  a 
stage  where  there  is  any  market  failure  that  justifies  government 
intervention. 

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF KYLE MCSLARROW, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

NATIONAL CABLE & TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION 

Good  morning,  Chairman  Inouye,  Ranking  Member  Stevens  and  members  of  the 
Committee.  My  name  is  Kyle  McSlarrow  and  I  am  the  President  and  Chief  Execu-
tive  Officer  of  the  National  Cable  &  Telecommunications  Association.  NCTA  rep-
resents  cable  operators  serving  more  than  90  percent  of  the  Nation’s  cable  TV 
households  and  more  than  200  cable  program  networks.  The  cable  industry  is  the 
Nation’s  largest  provider  of  high  speed  Internet  access,  making  cable  broadband 
service available to 92 percent of Americans, and has invested $130 billion to build 
a two-way interactive network with fiber optic technology. Cable companies also pro-
vide state-of-the-art digital telephone service to more than 15 million American con-
sumers. Cable operators are committed to delivering an open and satisfying Internet 
experience  to  their  customers,  and  the  dramatic  growth  in  cable  broadband  sub-
scribers is evidence of their success in doing so. 

The cable industry has consistently demonstrated its commitment to policies that 
ensure all Americans have access to affordable broadband. We supported, for exam-
ple,  proposals  advanced  by  Senator  Dorgan  and  Senator  Stevens  to  create  a  fund 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:29 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 074893 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74893.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

tailored  to  expanding  broadband  into  unserved  areas.  We  support  Senator  Inouye’s 
Broadband Data Improvement Act, because we believe that improving Federal data 
collection  and  dissemination  regarding  where  broadband  services  have  been  de-
ployed  in  the  United  States  is  necessary  in  order  to  achieve  the  goal  of  ubiquitous 
broadband availability for all Americans. And we continue to support: 

cally to unserved areas. 

that are unserved by an existing broadband provider. 

• Tax  credits  or  other  tax  incentives  to  providers  that  build  out  in  rural  areas 
• Reform of the RUS broadband loan program so that funding is targeted specifi-
• Expansion  of  the  FCC’s  Lifeline  and  Link-Up  Programs  to  help  ensure  that 
• Public-private partnerships to provide broadband in unserved areas. 
We  support  these  initiatives  because  we  recognize  that  the  government  can  play 
an  important  role  in  making  certain  that  the  economic  and  social  benefits  of 
broadband  connectivity  are  extended  to  all  areas  of  this  country,  and  we  look  for-
ward to working with you further to achieve these goals. 

broadband access is extended to low-income households. 

But  while  broadband  deployment  to  every  community  in  America  merits  the  full 
attention of policymakers, legislation calling for ‘‘network neutrality’’ or government 
intervention into the operation of networks would undermine the goals of broadband 
deployment and adoption. The development of the Internet, expansion of broadband 
networks,  and  creation  of  innovative  Internet  applications  we  have  seen  would  not 
have  occurred  at  such  a  rapid  pace  if  providers  were  restricted  in  how  they  could 
engineer  their  networks  to  accommodate  these  dynamic  developments.  The  govern-
ment’s  consistent  light  regulatory  touch  since  the  introduction  of  broadband  has 
worked. And only that continued regulatory freedom is likely to spur the investment 
and innovation that consumers have come to expect. 

Today,  I  would  like  to  focus  on  three  points  that  illustrate  why  the  Internet  and 
broadband services should not be subject to greater and more intrusive government 
regulation. 

First, cable broadband providers have demonstrated and remain committed to pro-

viding Americans the very best broadband service available. 

Second,  every  cable  modem  subscriber  today  can  access  the  content  he  or  she 
seeks over the Internet. Broadband providers do not block access to content. Reason-
able  network  optimization  techniques  not  only  enable  the  growth  and  development 
of the Internet, they protect consumers and their legitimate expectations. 

Finally,  the  national  policy  of  leaving  the  Internet  unregulated  has  been  a  re-
sounding  success.  Government  intervention  in  broadband  network  management 
would only slow the pace of innovation and prevent the natural development of traf-
fic solutions that is already occurring today. 
I. Cable Brought Broadband to America 

The  industry’s  commitment  to  the  deployment  of  broadband  is  reflected  in  the 
plain  statistics.  By  any  benchmark,  the  cable  industry  is  leading  efforts  to  spur 
broadband use and deployment. 

Investment. The cable industry has done more to stimulate broadband growth and 
innovation  than  any  other  industry.  Cable  operators  have  invested  $130  billion  in 
private  capital  since  the  passage  of  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  to  build 
broadband networks across the United States. Today 92 percent of American house-
holds,  or  about  117  million  homes,  have  access  to  cable  broadband  service,1 includ-
ing  96  percent  of  American  homes  to  which  cable  television  service  is  available.2 
This investment and expansion took place without any government subsidies. 

Competition. The cable industry’s efforts to deploy broadband have stimulated tre-
mendous investment in the provision of Internet access by competing providers, first 
by telephone companies and now wireless and satellite companies. This competition 
has  spurred  cable  broadband  providers  and  their  competitors  to  develop  better  and 
better  networks  and  applications  to  meet  consumer  demand  and  compete  for  their 
business.  As  former  FTC  Chairman  Timothy  Muris  has  explained,  ‘‘competition 
[among providers] spurs producers to meet consumer expectations because the mar-
ket generally imposes strict discipline on sellers who disappoint consumers and thus

lose  sales  to  producers  who  better  meet  consumer  needs.  These  same  competitive 
pressures also encourage producers to provide truthful information about their offer-
ings.’’ 3 

Most  notably,  as  the  availability  of  broadband  service  has  grown,  the  price-per- 
megabit  has  fallen  significantly,  and  the  speeds  cable  broadband  offers  have  shot 
up dramatically. When cable first offered high-speed broadband service as an alter-
native to dial-up access in the mid-90s, the speeds were approximately 1–1.5 Mbps. 
Today, most cable operators offer broadband speeds topping 5 Mbps and some opera-
tors,  such  as  Cablevision  and  Comcast,  offer  speeds  up  to  50  Mbps.  Comcast  and 
Cox Communications also offer a service that provides for ‘‘boosts’’ of higher speeds 
that double the throughput on an on-demand, capacity-available basis. 

Now  the  cable  industry  is  on  the  verge  of  making  the  next  leap—from 
‘‘broadband’’ to ‘‘wideband’’—with a technology which can enable dramatically high-
er download and upload speeds well above 100 Megabits per second. Several weeks 
ago,  for  example,  Comcast  launched  a  ‘‘wideband’’  service  in  Minneapolis-St.  Paul 
that  offers  speeds  of  50  Megabits  per  second.  Comcast  expects  to  have  wideband 
available  to  20  percent  of  its  systems  by  year-end  2008  and  to  all  homes  passed  by 
mid 2010. 

Increased  Use  and  Demand.  The  high  quality  and  easy  availability  of  cable 
broadband  has  led  to  the  widespread  adoption  of  broadband  use.  Today,  the  cable 
industry has more than 35 million broadband customers.4 Overall, approximately 64 
million broadband households nationwide have broadband service, and that number 
continues to grow. 

New  Content,  Web  Services,  and  Applications.  The  efforts  of  broadband  network 
providers  to  build  larger  and  faster  networks  have  helped  ensure  the  success  of 
countless  numbers  of  new  Internet  businesses  and  applications—online  video  serv-
ices,  social  networking  websites,  data-sharing  services,  and  online  interactive  game 
services, to name a few. Despite concerns about alleged limited access to broadband, 
use of Internet video on demand has grown at the most dramatic rate. In July 2006, 
107 million Americans watched video online and about 60 percent of Internet users 
downloaded  more  than  7  billion  videos  off  the  Internet.5 In  February  2008,  nearly 
135 million U.S. Internet users spent an average of 204 minutes viewing 10.1 billion 
online  videos.  YouTube  represented  34  percent  of  those  online  videos,  or  nearly  3.5 
billion  in  total.6 To  put  it  into  context,  in  2006,  YouTube  consumed  as  much  band-
width as the entire Internet consumed in the year 2000.7 

Television  networks  are  now  offering  cable  modem  and  other  broadband  cus-
tomers  video  online,  such  as  NBC  Universal  and  News  Corp.’s  new  Hulu  service. 
Book retailers are now offering online digital novels; and music sales websites, such 
as  iTunes,  continue  to  grow.  Social  networking  websites,  where  users  share  home 
videos,  pictures,  and  music  content,  are  also  on  the  rise—in  2007,  an  estimated 
126.5  million  people  in  North  America  participated  in  an  online  social  networking 
website.8 Internet commerce also continues to grow. Last year, over $135 billion was 
spent purchasing goods and services over the Internet.9 

For years, net neutrality proponents have argued that without government inter-
vention, broadband providers would stifle competing services and content providers;

Internet  development  and  usage  would  stagnate;  and  consumers  would  be  unable 
to  use  their  broadband  connections  to  download  video  or  access  other  emerging  ap-
plications.  In  fact,  cable’s  investment  in  broadband  has  driven  innovation  and  in-
vestment  in  new  content  and  applications  at  the  edge—the  exact  opposite  of  what 
was predicted by advocates of net regulation. 

There is no better proof that there presently exists no ‘‘problem’’ needing a ‘‘solu-
tion’’  than  YouTube.  YouTube  would  have  been  a  pipe  dream  in  2002.  Six  years 
later, however, YouTube—the proverbial ‘‘two guys in a garage’’ who allegedly could 
not  survive,  let  alone  thrive,  unless  the  Internet  were  regulated—has  become  a 
multi-billion  dollar  enterprise.  And  YouTube  is  now  owned  by  Google,  which  itself 
has  grown  to  become  one  of  the  largest  companies  in  the  world  with  a  market  cap-
italization of $169 billion. 

Here’s an incontrovertible truth: the staggering growth of these companies would 
not have occurred without cable’s investment in and deployment of the reliable high- 
speed  broadband  service  that  provides  the  ecosystem  in  which  Google,  YouTube, 
Yahoo! and other Internet services can flourish. 
II. Network Optimization Enhances and Enables the Internet Experience 

In  2006,  I  testified  before  this  Committee  and  stated  that  cable  operators  do  not 
and  would  not  block  subscribers’  access  to  any  lawful  content,  applications  or  serv-
ices. That statement remains true today. Cable modem subscribers have the ability 
to  do  anything  they  want  to  on  the  Internet.  They  can  download  or  stream  videos, 
upload  and  send  pictures  to  friends,  or  call  family  across  the  world.  They  can  also 
attach  gaming  devices,  or  any  other  computing  device  they  want  to  use  to  the  net-
work. They can use file-sharing software from peer-to-peer networks. If they couldn’t 
do what they wanted, they would soon not be cable modem subscribers. They would 
go to our competitors. 

Cable  subscribers  can  enjoy  the  most  advanced  and  cutting-edge  Internet  sites 
and  applications  because  of  the  extensive  efforts  cable  operators  constantly  under-
take  to  make  all  content  and  applications  flow  smoothly  and  work  seamlessly  to-
gether  over  the  network.  In  1999,  there  were  only  2  million  households  with 
broadband  service  in  the  United  States;  today  there  are  approximately  64  million. 
This  is  a  great  success  story—but  with  this  success  comes  the  need  to  manage  the 
network so that every household has good user experience. 

Cable providers built a smart infrastructure that has the capability to evolve and 
meet  the  challenges  of  multimedia,  file  sharing,  and  other  bandwidth-intensive  ap-
plications.  But  cable  broadband  subscribers  currently  enjoy  the  full  benefits  of 
broadband only because cable operators manage their networks on a content-agnos-
tic  basis  to  provide  seamless  connectivity,  deter  spam  and  viruses,  and  make  sure 
that a tiny minority of users don’t slow down the Internet for everyone else. Various 
estimates  are  that  as  few  as  5  percent  of  customers  use  from  50  to  90  percent  of 
the total capacity of the network. In Japan, it is estimated that 1 percent of Internet 
users consume 47 percent of the total Internet traffic.10 Faced with these voracious 
bandwidth  consumers,  cable  operators  may  engage  in  reasonable,  content-agnostic 
network  management  practices—triggered  by  objective  criteria  based  upon  network 
traffic  levels—to  ensure  that  the  relatively  few  customers  who  utilize  bandwidth- 
heavy applications do not degrade or otherwise adversely affect broadband Internet 
access for the vast majority of customers. 

There have been some recent concerns that network management practices affect-
ing certain high-bandwidth-consuming peer-to-peer (P2P) applications are ‘‘discrimi-
natory.’’  P2P  traffic  can  consume  a  disproportionately  large  amount  of  network  re-
sources—far,  far  more  than  any  other  Internet  use.  If  even  a  small  fraction  of  cus-
tomers  are  using  these  bandwidth-intensive  applications  at  the  same  time,  it  can 
interfere  with  the  ability  of  the  vast  majority  of  all  other  customers  in  that  area 
to surf the web, watch streaming video, make voice-over-IP calls, or engage in other 
routine uses of the Internet. 

Providers  can’t  build  their  way  out  of  this  problem—in  spite  of  increasing  capac-
ity, many P2P protocols are written specifically to commandeer as much bandwidth 
as  is  available.  Instead,  providers  optimize  their  networks  in  order  to  balance  the 
needs  of  all  of  their  customers.  Far  from  inhibiting  access,  smart  network  tech-
niques  protect  the  ability  of  our  customers  to  make  the  greatest  and  most  flexible 
use of the Internet. They are a reasonable response to an identified congestion prob-
lem that has the benefit of allowing all other applications—particularly latency-sen-
sitive  applications  like  VoIP  and  streaming  video—to  work  better.  As  the  Institute 
for  Policy  Innovation  recently  stated,  ‘‘[i]n  almost  all  cases,  network  management

today  is  unnoticed  by  consumers.  The  opposite,  a  total  lack  of  management,  would 
not  be  true.  If  network  operators  were  precluded  from  managing  their  networks, 
consumers would be negatively affected.’’ 11 Sound network management is essential 
to  ensuring  a  stable  broadband  platform.  Google,  Yahoo!,  Amazon,  and  service  pro-
viders  like  Vonage  could  not  carry  on  their  businesses  if  bandwidth-consuming  ap-
plications  were  allowed  to  block  customers  from  accessing  their  Websites  or  com-
pleting their transactions. Because of network management, such businesses can de-
velop  business  models  that  hinge  on  the  expectation  that  their  service  will  not  be 
crowded  out  by  congestion  caused  by  heavy  bandwidth-using  software.  Far  from 
being  ‘‘neutral,’’  a  network  that  is  not  managed  simply  allows  those  who  want  to 
demand all the bandwidth for themselves to do so unchecked. 

Reasonable  network  management  practices  are  also  vital  to  combating  the  well- 
documented,  illegal  distribution  of  copyrighted  material  on  the  Internet.  We  cannot 
ignore the problem of piracy. It is a problem that affects not just broadband service 
providers,  legitimate  broadband  application  providers  and  content  providers,  but 
also  law-abiding  consumers.  Ultimately  they  are  the  ones  that  bear  the  burden  of 
congestion  caused  by  those  who  abuse  their  network  access  to  engage  in  the  wide-
spread distribution of infringing works. Technology is agnostic, but, according to one 
source,  90  percent  of  P2P  downloads  are  pirated  material.12 Broadband  providers, 
content  owners  and  others  all  have  a  stake  in  exploring  technology  solutions  that 
address  piracy  in  ways  that  respect  our  customers’  expectations  and  respect  the 
copyright owner’s rights, not simply to curtail congestion but for reasons of fairness 
to those who invest in content and make an important contribution to our economy. 
Government  action  that  would  inhibit  development  of  innovative  approaches  to 
thwarting piracy and enhancing the online experience for the vast majority of Inter-
net users would harm content creation and ultimately consumers. 

So,  is  there  evidence  that  these  challenges  are  insurmountable  and  require  more 
government  regulation?  Quite  the  contrary.  The  same  technological  innovation  that 
gives rise to some of these challenges has produced creative ways to fight spam and 
viruses. The same private sector collaboration that allowed the countless number of 
networks that make up the Internet to exchange traffic and engage in peering, has 
and continues to focus on new challenges. 

Some P2P developers are creating new ways to make that technology more band-
width-efficient  and  network-friendly,  so  that  it  may  continue  to  emerge  as  a  useful 
way to distribute legal content. Cable companies and other broadband providers are 
working hard to find ways to address concerns about network congestion and create 
consumer-friendly  options  that  allow  the  majority  of  users  to  access  content  at  the 
speeds needed. The ‘‘P4P Working Group’’—a collaborative industry effort to develop 
network  management  solutions  that  benefit  cable  and  other  broadband  operators, 
P2P software firms, and consumers—is one such effort. 

Broadband  providers  have  also  begun  testing  and  dialogue  with  P2P  applications 
providers to make networks and P2P applications friendlier to one another. For ex-
ample,  Verizon  has  been  working  with  Pando  Networks,  a  P2P  software  developer, 
and the P4P Working Group to develop a more bandwidth efficient file sharing pro-
tocol.13 Just last week, Comcast and Pando announced their intention to lead an in-
dustry-wide  effort  to  create  a  ‘‘P2P  Bill  of  Rights  and  Responsibilities.’’ 14 And 
Comcast  and  BitTorrent  recently  reached  an  agreement  in  which  Comcast  pledged 
to  adopt  a  capacity  management  technique  based  on  individual  users’  consumption 
during peak periods rather than based on a particular protocol. 

Broadband  providers  and  Internet  content  and  service  providers  have  mutual  in-
centives to develop workable solutions that enhance customers’ Internet experiences. 
Cable  operators’  tremendous  investments  have  laid  the  foundation  for  robust 
broadband  networks  that  have  spurred  the  remarkable  explosion  of  new  services 
and innovations on the Internet. In turn, the vast array of applications and services 
now  available  on  the  Internet  drive  more  and  more  people  to  become  broadband 
users.

III. The Government Should Continue to Refrain From Regulation 

50 

Congress  should  resist  calls  to  interfere  with  broadband  providers’  freedom  to 
manage their respective networks in order to satisfy the evolving needs of American 
consumers.  Cable  modem  service  has  never  been  subject  to  regulation.  Six  years 
after  the  FCC  classified  cable’s  broadband  offering  as  an  unregulated  information 
service 15 and nearly 3 years after the FCC determined that no regulation was need-
ed  to  encourage  broadband  deployment  and  preserve  and  promote  Internet  usage 
and demand,16 there has been no evidence of any practices that would change those 
conclusions  or  warrant  government  intervention  generally  or  specifically  with  re-
spect  to  permissible  network  management  activities.  The  disaster  scenarios  voiced 
by network neutrality proponents for many years have never happened. In fact, the 
opposite  has  happened—the  Internet  is  booming  without  regulation.  There  is  quite 
simply no problem requiring a government solution. 

Under  the  guise  of  preventing  discrimination,  ‘‘net  neutrality’’  proponents  would 
have the government determine which network management techniques are permis-
sible.  But  putting  every  network  management  strategy  up  for  debate  before  regu-
lators would severely hamper the ability of network providers to ensure high-quality 
and  reliable  Internet  access  for  their  subscribers.  Depriving  network  operators  of 
certain  bandwidth  management  tools  only  makes  the  network  less  efficient  for  ev-
eryone.  Ultimately,  interfering  with  an  operator’s  ability  to  manage  its  network 
would  harm  consumers  and  prevent  them  from  accessing  the  content  they  desire. 
Adept network optimization techniques are fundamental to creating and preserving 
the stable ‘‘ecosystem’’ for online service providers that ensures an optimal customer 
experience. 

Government  intervention  in  a  fast-changing  technological  world  could  result  in 
very real problems developing very quickly. Network management practices are con-
stantly changing and evolving—as networks grow, consumer usage patterns change, 
and  new  technologies  emerge.  It  would  be  impossible  for  any  regulation  to  keep  up 
with these changes. Nor does the government have the expertise or resources to sec-
ond-guess the thousands of network management decisions broadband network engi-
neers  must  make  every  day.  It  is  far  more  likely  that  government  interference  in 
the  development  of  the  market  could  foreclose  or  prevent  the  emergence  of  cross- 
industry efforts that are more likely to get the solutions right. 
Conclusion 

Misplaced concerns over legitimate and reasonable network management practices 
do  not  justify  the  enactment  of  open-ended  regulation  of  the  Internet,  particularly 
where the costs of such regulation are foreseeable and substantial. Given the growth 
of broadband competition and the breathtaking pace of technological change, govern-
ment  intervention  is  unwarranted.  As  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  has  warned, 
regulation of Internet access at this stage of market development could have ‘‘poten-
tially  adverse  and  unintended  effects,’’ 17 including  reduced  product  and  service  in-
novation.  And  net  neutrality  requirements  would  frustrate  the  Federal  policy  of 
‘‘preserv[ing]  the  vibrant  and  competitive  free  market  that  presently  exists  for  the 
Internet . . ., unfettered by Federal or State regulation.’’ 18 Today’s hands-off policy 
has  given  us  the  flexibility  to  innovate  and  respond  to  consumer  demand.  By  con-
trast, proposals for ‘‘net neutrality’’ amount to regulation of the Internet that would 
undermine—not promote—consumer choice and welfare. 
Thank you again for inviting me to speak to you today. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
And our last witness, Professor Lessig.

STATEMENT OF LAWRENCE LESSIG, C. WENDELL AND EDITH 
M. CARLSMITH PROFESSOR OF LAW, STANFORD LAW SCHOOL 

51 

Mr. LESSIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  had  the  honor  to  be  at  this  Committee’s  first  hearing,  5  years 
ago, when the words ‘‘network neutrality’’ were uttered. And it’s ex-
traordinarily rewarding to see the progress that’s been made in the 
understanding around this issue in the last 5 and a half years. 

But, I do want to start by remarking what strikes me as a funda-
mental  misunderstanding  about  the  history  of  the  Internet,  which 
is  pressed  by  the  Senators  who  were  to  my  left  earlier  today;  in 
particular, by Senator Sununu. 

The  Internet  began  in  a  context  where  its  code,  the  architecture 
of  the  Internet,  and  the  regulation  of  government  through  Title  II 
in  the  narrow-band  Internet  context,  created  a  platform  of  funda-
mental neutral competition. The technology was incapable of allow-
ing  ISPs  to  discriminate  among  content  and  applications,  and  the 
government  took  a  very  active  role  in  guaranteeing  that  Internet 
service providers provided neutral access to the Internet. 

Now,  of  course,  that  context  has  changed  dramatically.  Because 
of changes in regulation, instead of having about 6,000 ISPs in this 
nation,  we  essentially  have,  in  any  district,  one,  maybe  two.  And 
so,  that  context  has  radically  changed.  But,  as  it  has  changed,  it 
has changed, not just because the law has changed; it’s changed be-
cause  the  technology  has  increasingly  enabled  providers  to  dis-
criminate among content and applications. 

So, imagine, for example, if the electricity grid, which, right now, 
is  a  neutral  platform—when  you  plug  your  Sony  TV  in,  it  doesn’t 
know  the  difference  between  that  and  a  Panasonic  TV—imagine  if 
it, when you plugged it in, asked the question to the television set, 
‘‘Are you Sony or are you Panasonic?’’ and the price differs depend-
ing  upon  whether  you’re  Sony  or  Panasonic,  or  whether  it’s  a  tele-
vision or a radio, or whether it’s public TV or private TV. The point 
is,  it’s  possible  the  electricity  grid  would  become  discriminatory  in 
exactly  that  way.  And  the  question  is  what  Congress  would  do  if, 
in fact, that’s where the electricity grid went. 

Now,  another  point  that’s  been  made  consistently  by  those  who 
oppose  network  neutrality  regulation  is,  we  should  sit  around  and 
wait to see the discrimination; and when we see the discrimination, 
let’s  do  something  about  it.  But,  that  point  fundamentally  mis-
understands  how  investment  decisions  are  made  in  Silicon  Valley. 
In  Silicon  Valley,  investment  decisions  are  made  today  depending 
on what the investors believe the network will look like in 5 years. 
And if, today, they believe the owners of the network will have the 
freedom  to  pick  and  choose  which  applications  will  run  or  which 
content will be permitted, they will not invest in applications today 
which  are  fundamental  and  different  from  the  kind  of  applications 
the network owners want to allow. 

So,  it’s  fundamentally  mistaken  to  say  that  there’s  no  cost  to 
competition  or  innovation  or  the  economy  from  doing  nothing.  The 
cost is the extraordinary uncertainty investors face about what the 
future  of  the  network  will  look  like  and  what  exactly  their  oppor-
tunity to compete will be. 

Now,  finally,  to  the  Senators  who  are  still  on  my  right  here,  I 
would  say  I  support,  fundamentally,  the  move  to  enact  network

neutrality legislation. I think, 5 years into this debate—it’s actually 
10  years  since  this  issue  was  first  framed—is  long  enough,  and 
Congress  needs  to  take  a  very  clear  policy  position  that  supports 
an  infrastructure  of  abundance  for  the  network  and  does  not  envi-
sion the network becoming a network where owners try to leverage 
scarcity to produce value. 

But,  it’s  extraordinarily  important  that,  whatever  regulation  is 
placed  on  this  network  be  as  minimal  and  clear  as  possible.  And 
I  get  very  anxious  with  the  use  of  words  like  ‘‘reasonable’’  in  this 
context, without clear specification of the problem. 

So,  in  my  view,  the  core  problem  is  addressed  by  the  four  prin-
ciples  that  Chairman  Powell  originally  envisioned,  and  Chairman 
Martin  has  adopted,  plus  one  more.  And  that  one  additional  prin-
ciple  would  ban  discriminatory  tiering  by  network  owners  for  pro-
viders  of  content  and  applications.  And  those,  it  seems  to  me,  de-
fine the minimal regulation necessary to guarantee the principle to 
continue  an  environment  of  extraordinary  competition  that  the 
Internet originally gave us. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LAWRENCE LESSIG, C. WENDELL AND EDITH M. CARLSMITH 

PROFESSOR OF LAW, STANFORD LAW SCHOOL 

Introduction 

Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, my name is Lawrence Lessig, and 
I  am  a  Professor  of  Law  at  Stanford  Law  School.  For  more  than  a  decade,  I  have 
been  studying  the  relationship  between  technology  and  Internet  policy,  and  in  par-
ticular,  the  relationship  between  the  architecture  of  the  Internet  and  innovation.  I 
am honored to have the opportunity to address the question that is before this Com-
mittee—the future of the Internet. 

This is the third time that I have addressed this Committee about essentially the 
same  question.  In  October,  2002,  I  testified  about  ‘‘network  neutrality.’’  That  was, 
I  believe,  the  first  time  that  idea  had  been  presented  to  this  Committee.  In  Feb-
ruary, 2006, I testified at a hearing devoted to ‘‘network neutrality’’ exclusively. And 
in my view, the question before this Committee today, ‘‘The Future of the Internet,’’ 
is directly tied to the future of network neutrality. 

Yet  while  these  questions  are  not  new,  in  my  view,  Congress  has  yet  to  address 
them  adequately.  For  the  reasons  I  outline  below,  this  failure  to  act  continues  to 
threaten the growth and economic vitality of the Internet. Thus, I would urge Con-
gress to enact legislation that sets the basic framework for this critical economic in-
frastructure  in  a  way  that  assures  the  greatest  innovation  and  economic  growth. 
That  framework  would  embed  a  design  principle  that  gave  birth  to  the  Internet— 
network neutrality. 
‘‘Network Neutrality’’ 

The  term  ‘‘network  neutrality’’  was  introduced  into  the  academic  debate  by  Pro-
fessor Tim Wu in early 2003.1 But the idea behind the term has been a central focus 
of network theorists since the early 1980s. ‘‘Network Neutrality’’ builds upon a fun-
damental recognition about the relationship between a certain network design (what 
network  architects  Jerome  Saltzer,  David  Clark,  and  David  Reed  called  the  ‘‘end- 
to-end’’ 2 principle)  and  economic  innovation.  As  former  FCC  Chief  Economist,  Pro-
fessor Gerald R. Faulhauber, described the relationship at a Stanford conference in 
2000, 

141 (2003).

‘‘if  I  translate  this  into  . . .  economics,  [‘‘end-to-end’’]  in  engineering  is  the 
equivalent  of  . . .  perfect  competitive  market  [in]  economi[cs].  It’s  the  thing 
that makes it all transparent, open, [where] anybody can do anything.’’ 3 

‘‘End-to-end’’ or, to update the language, ‘‘network neutrality’’ is the equivalent of 
perfect competition because it creates an environment, or platform, upon which com-
petition among applications and content happens with minimum interference by the 
network or platform owner. Like a traditional marketplace, or a modern stock mar-
ket, a neutral network assures that in the negotiation between buyer and seller, or 
innovator  and  consumer,  the  network  itself  plays  little  or  no  substantive  role.  All 
the  power  within  this  negotiation  is  shifted  to  the  edge,  to  those  economic  actors 
directly  responsible  for  innovation  and  growth  in  network  applications  and  con-
tent—namely, consumers and innovators. 

The  original  Internet  achieved  this  architecture  of  competition  unintentionally. 
The  framers  of  the  network’s  original  design  were  not  economists.  They  were  not 
focused on building an engine of economic growth. Yet that was the consequence of 
a technical design intended to facilitate development flexibility. A network designed 
to  enable  anyone  to  develop  new  applications  to  run  was  also  a  network  designed 
to maximize competition among applications and content.4 

The  reason  for  this  is  simple  but  technical:  under  the  Internet’s  original  design, 
there  was  no  easy  way  within  the  network  to  discriminate  among  applications  or 
content. The network was built without the knowledge to discriminate built in. Just 
as the Post Office can’t cheaply pick and choose which letters to deliver based upon 
the  sentiments  expressed  in  the  letters,  so  too  the  original  Internet  couldn’t  easily 
pick and choose which packets of data to send based on the content of those packets. 
It was blind to that content. That blindness encouraged a wide range of innovation. 
This  technical  feature  of  the  original  network  is  now  changing.  Network  owners 
increasingly  have  the  ability  to  in  effect  open  the  Internet’s  letters—to  peek  inside 
the  packets,  and  choose  which  go  faster,  or  which  get  blocked.  And  while  there  are 
plenty of legitimate reasons why a network owner might need to ‘‘manage’’ network 
behavior, there are anti-competitive, or strategic reasons as well. Which reason mo-
tivates a network owner turns upon the business model that the network owner has 
adopted—either  a  business  model  of  abundance  and  neutrality,  serving  whatever 
legal  applications  and  content  users  and  innovators  want,  or  a  business  model  of 
scarcity  and  control,  leveraging  financial  return  out  of  the  scarcity  their  gate-keep-
ing  role  allows  them  to  create  or  maintain.  If  policymakers  were  confident  network 
owners  were  following  a  model  of  abundance,  there  would  be  less  reason  to  be  con-
cerned  about  how  they  manage  the  packets  on  their  network.  But  because  policy-
makers  are  uncertain  about  the  ultimate  motive  for  this  ‘‘management,’’  extensive 
inquiry into the technical questions of network management become important. 

In  my  view,  Congress  could  substantially  simplify  this  area  by  setting  a  strong 
policy  in  favor  of  networks  with  a  business  model  of  abundance  and  neutrality.  A 
clear  set  of  network  neutrality  principles  would  do  just  that.  If  Congress  made  it 
perfectly  clear  that  the  FCC  had  the  charge  and  authority  to  assure  that  the  pro-
viders  of  this  critical  economic  infrastructure  were  deploying  this  infrastructure 
with  abundance  in  view,  businesses  would  conform  to  that  requirement.  The  eco-
nomic question here is much more important than the financial returns to one par-
ticular  industry.  A  powerful  and  vibrant  broadband  infrastructure  is  crucial  to  the 
economic growth of the Nation generally. 

In addressing the question before this Committee, I would offer four points to con-

sider. 
1.  The  question  of  effective  regulation  for  critical  economic  infrastructure  did  not 

begin with the Internet. 

Though  the  Internet  is  certainly  ‘‘new’’  within  the  history  of  critical  economic  in-
frastructures, the regulatory questions it raises are as old as the Republic. Through-
out  our  history,  policymakers  have  weighed  how  best  to  encourage  the  spread  of 
critical economic infrastructure, recognizing that sometimes subsidy is required, and 
at other times, simple regulation is sufficient. The Post Office, for example, was per-
haps this Nation’s first communication infrastructure, and as many have noted, the 
Federal  Government  played  a  critical  role  in  assuring  that  that  infrastructure  sup-
ported  the  rapid  growth  of  commercial  newspaper  and  periodical  publications,  both

for  economic  and  political  reasons.5 Likewise  with  the  telegraph,  railroads,  elec-
tricity,  the  national  highway  system,  and  telephones:  In  each  case,  the  policy  ques-
tion  was  how  best  to  encourage  broad  scale,  and  relatively  inexpensive  infrastruc-
ture  to  support  critical  economic  growth.  How,  in  other  words,  to  encourage  an  in-
frastructure of abundance rather than an infrastructure of scarcity. 

Throughout  this  history,  to  achieve  abundance  it  has  sometimes  been  necessary 
to limit the freedom of infrastructure providers. Common carrier regulation did that 
substantially.  But  even  without  common  carrier  regulation,  some  limits  have  been 
essential to assuring that the interests of those who build this economic infrastruc-
ture are aligned with the interests of the Nation that depends upon it. 

One  critical  limitation  has  been  upon  the  ability  of  infrastructure  owners  to  dis-
criminate.  Consider,  for  example,  the  infrastructure  for  electricity.  As  I  have  testi-
fied before, the electricity grid is a fundamentally neutral network. Innovators (like 
Sony, or Panasonic) are invited to develop applications (televisions, and radios) that 
use  that  network.  They  don’t  need  permission  from  the  network  owners  (PG&E, 
Commonwealth  Edison)  to  deploy  those  innovations.  When  you  plug  your  television 
set  into  an  outlet,  the  network  doesn’t  ask  (as  it  well  could,  given  modern  tech-
nology)  whether  the  television  set  is  made  by  Sony  or  Panasonic.  It  doesn’t  ask 
whether  the  function  of  the  appliance  is  to  provide  television  or  radio  service.  In-
stead,  so  long  as  application  developers  develop  appliances  that  comply  with  the 
protocols of the network, the electricity grid will provide service to those appliances 
neutrally.  That  doesn’t  mean  for  free—for  obviously,  we  all  pay  for  the  electricity 
we  consume.  It  doesn’t  mean  unmetered—obviously,  we  pay  more  if  we  use  more. 
But it does mean that Sony doesn’t need to pay a special tax to PG&E for the right 
to develop Sony television sets, or digital music players. Sony, in this model, is free 
to  innovate  without  permission  from  the  infrastructure  owners—the  electricity  net-
work. 

We  could  of  course  imagine  a  different  system.  And  indeed,  we  could  well  build 
that  different  system  into  our  electricity  grid  right  now.  The  electricity  grid  could 
be  architected  to  ask  the  application  who  made  it,  or  what  its  function  is.  The  net-
work  could  then  decide  whether  or  how  to  serve  electricity  depending  upon  the  an-
swer  to  that  question.  Providers  of  appliances  could  then  be  taxed  depending  upon 
the  elasticity  of  demand  for  their  products.  Electricity  providers  could  then  enjoy 
greater revenue for their product from this tax. 

I  take  it  there  are  few  who  believe  that  this  alternative  electricity  system  would 
be  better  thanthe  system  we  have  today—even  though  economists  could  well  de-
scribe the conditions under which this alternative may well be more ‘‘efficient.’’ 

My  point,  however,  is  not  about  whether  those  conditions  obtain,  either  for  the 
electricity  grid,  or  the  Internet.  It  is  instead  to  emphasize  the  value  of  being  con-
servative in policymaking in both contexts. Anyone arguing that the electricity net-
work  should  be  rebuilt  to  permit  PG&E  to  discriminate  among  applications  using 
its  network  should  bear  a  significant  burden  before  that  change  was  allowed.  And 
likewise for anyone arguing that the core competitive feature of the original Internet 
should be altered: he or she too should bear a significant burden before that change 
is  allowed  to  alter  the  critical  competitive  environment  that  the  Internet  presents. 
Giving up on network neutrality would be like permitting PG&E to tax appliance 
manufacturers  for  the  privilege  of  using  electricity  on  its  network:  No  doubt,  that 
would  be  a  boon  for  PG&E,  and  its  shareholders.  It  would  not  be  a  boon  for  the 
economy. 
2.  Policymakers  should  adopt  policies  that  drive  network  providers  toward  business 
models  of  broadband  abundance  rather  than  business  models  that  exploit  scar-
city. 

There are at least two clear business models for broadband deployment—one that 
drives  to  broadband  abundance,  the  other  that  leverages  broadband  scarcity  to 
maximize network provider returns. There is a critical economic justification for gov-
ernment to try to tilt broadband providers toward the model of abundance. 

Again,  the  broadband  Internet  is  infrastructure.  Like  electricity  grids,  and  na-
tional  highways,  it  supports  a  wide  range  of  economic  and  social  activity.  As  schol-
ars have demonstrated, private actors providing public infrastructure but focused on 
private  gain  alone  would  rationally  maximize  their  own  return  at  the  expense  of 
this  broader  public  gain.6 Interventions  that  create  the  incentive  among  infrastruc-

ture  providers  to  support  these  broader  interests  produce  real  economic  return  to 
the economy, even if they mean less financial return to the infrastructure providers. 
For  example,  consider  by  contrast  policy  decisions  affecting  the  growth  of  cable. 
Though  cable  television  obviously  provides  valuable  free  speech  opportunities  and 
economic return through the incentives it creates to produce new content, it is plau-
sible  that  cable  television  is  not  a  core  infrastructure  technology,  since  it  does  not 
generate  a  diverse  range  of  technology  and  applications  building  upon  the  cable 
platform.  For  this  reason,  it  may  well  have  been  sensible  for  Congress  to  grant  to 
cable owners an almost unlimited range of freedom to structure production decisions 
as  they  want,  and  develop  cable  offerings  and  prices  as  the  market  will  bear.  The 
product  of  these  policy  decisions  is  obviously  not  uncontested—families  continue  to 
resist  the  bundling  of  cable  providers,  making  it  hard,  for  example,  for  parents  to 
select  a  mix  of  content  that  minimizes  advertising;  consumers  generally  resist  sig-
nificant  price  increases;  developers  of  independently  produced  content  point  to  the 
radical drop in independently produced television content after the relaxation of gov-
ernment  ownership  regulations.  All  of  these  ‘‘problems’’  are  the  predictable  result 
of allowing cable owners the degree of economic freedom the law now permits them. 
And while I share with many the wish that things were different, I can well under-
stand that there are limited public policy reasons for regulatory intervention. 

But when the platform is not just a video delivery system, but instead, a general 
purpose  digital  innovation  platform,  the  justification  for  regulatory  intervention 
changes  dramatically.  In  the  world  of  entertainment,  cable  TV  is  just  one  option. 
But  in  the  world  of  digital  communication  infrastructures,  the  Internet  is  every-
thing.  And  assuring  that  this  infrastructure  gets  built  with  maximum  capacity  at 
the  lowest  cost,  and  with  minimal  burdens  on  application  and  content  developers, 
is a critical public policy objective. 
3. Investment decisions by venture capitalists are driven by expectations offuture, not 

present, behavior. 

In  both  of  the  earlier  hearings  at  which  I  was  invited  to  testify  about  network 
neutrality issues, critics of regulation argued that there was no reason to intervene, 
because there was no actual evidence of discrimination. In the 2-years since my last 
testimony, however, network owners have provided this Congress with a significant 
number  of  examples  of  exactly  the  kind  of  harmful  discrimination  that  network 
theorists  have  long  predicted.  In  2005,  the  FCC  was  forced  to  intervene  to  stop  a 
DSL provider from blocking voice-over-IP technologies. In 2007, AT&T technologists 
acted  to  block  the  audio  of  Pearl  Jam  performer  as  he  criticized  the  President  in 
a  webcast  carried  by  AT&T.  Verizon  has  been  accused  of  blocking  text  messages 
that  it  found  too  controversial.  And  most  recently,  Comcast  has  been  shown  to  be 
blocking  particular  Internet  applications  that  might  compete  with  its  video  service, 
using  network  management  practices  not  approved  by  any  independent  standards 
body.  If  ‘‘network  neutrality’’  was  ‘‘a  solution  in  search  of  a  problem’’  in  2002,  and 
2006,  the  network  owners  have  been  very  kind  to  network  neutrality  advocates  by 
now  providing  plenty  of  examples  of  the  problem  to  which  network  neutrality  rules 
would be a solution. 

But  there  is  one  very  practical  point  that  this  debate  about  whether  there  is  sig-
nificant  current  discrimination  misses.  Venture  capitalists  don’t  chose  whether  to 
invest in new innovation based upon what is happening on the Internet today. They 
base  their  decisions  upon  what  they  expect  behavior  on  the  Internet  will  be  tomor-
row.  They  decide,  for  example,  whether  to  fund  a  new  Internet  application  today 
based upon whether they believe the entrepreneur will be able to deploy that appli-
cation  profitably  in  2  or  5  years.  That  question  in  turn  will  depend  upon  whether 
network  owners  will  be  free  to  discriminate  against  that  application  in  the  future. 
Or  more  generally,  whether  network  owners  will  be  free  to  tax  that  application,  to 
extract  some  portion  of  that  application’s  profit.  If  venture  capitalists  believe  that 
network  owners  will  have  that  freedom  tomorrow,  then  for  a  certain  range  of  inno-
vations, they will choose not to invest in that innovation today. 

It  is  for  this  reason  that  I  and  others  have  consistently  argued  that  Congress 
could  well  be  slowing  the  growth  of  the  Internet  economy  by  not  setting  today  a 
clear  principle  about  the  rules  that  will  govern  Internet  innovation  tomorrow.  This 
‘‘wait  and  see’’  attitude  ignores  that  sector  of  the  economy  that  can’t  afford  to  wait 
and  see:  investors.  The  ‘‘wait  and  see’’  argument  is  thus  oblivious  to  the  real  eco-
nomic costs that uncertainty here creates. 

If Congress were clear in its direction to the FCC about the policy the FCC is re-
quired  to  implement,  then  any  uncertainty  about  network  owner  behavior  could  be 
eliminated.  And  any  costs  from  that  uncertainty  could  also  be  eliminated.  So  long 
as  a  simple  and  clear  rule  signaled  to  the  markets  that  network  owners  would  be 
in the business of producing abundant broadband by encouraging innovation rather

56 

than  leveraging  value  from  scarcity,  markets  would  react  to  that  signal  in  a  way 
that encouraged greater investment in new innovation. 
4.  Congress  should  direct  the  FCC  to  implement,  with  the  minimal  regulatory  inter-
vention  necessary,  a  policy  that  drives  network  providers  to  a  business  model 
ofabundance. 

It  has  been  my  view  for  the  past  decade  that  Congress  needs  to  signal  a  clear 
policy supporting neutral and abundant broadband growth. Without doubt, however, 
such a policy can go too far. The objective of regulators must be the minimum inter-
vention  necessary  to  steer  broadband  providers  to  a  business  model  of  abundance 
rather  than  scarcity,  while  recognizing  the  limited  competence  of  regulators  in  any 
field  of  new  technological  innovation.  That  limited  competence  means  regulators 
should focus on the behavior that they can monitor well, using the levers they have 
over that regulable behavior, so that they can have confidence about behavior at the 
layers of the network that they can’t regulate as well. 

Congress can achieve that end by setting out clear neutrality principles in legisla-
tion,  while  charging  the  FCC  with  the  responsibility  for  carrying  those  principles 
into effect. Congress’ principle, again, should be to encourage broadband abundance, 
by  steering  providers  away  from  a  business  model  that  leverages  scarcity.  But  in 
pursing that clear legislative objective, the FCC should proceed in a careful and lim-
ited way, escalating regulatory intervention only when existing strategies have been 
proven  to  fail.  Put  differently,  if  a  clear  objective  has  been  set  by  Congress,  then 
an  FCC  strategy  of  ‘‘shock  and  awe’’  is  both  unnecessary  and  counter  productive. 
Instead,  the  interventions  by  the  FCC  should  be  directed  to  the  end  of  convincing 
broadband  providers  that  the  legislative  policy  choice  of  Congress  will  be  achieved. 
A consistent regulatory practice to that end will convince investors of the only prof-
itable broadband investment strategy. That will drive providers to the economically 
optimal broadband strategy. 

As  I  testified  in  2006,  in  my  view  that  minimal  strategy  right  now  marries  the 
basic  principles  of  ‘‘Internet  Freedom’’  first  outlined  by  Chairman  Michael  Powell, 
and  modified  more  recently  by  the  FCC,  to  one  additional  requirement—a  ban  on 
discriminatory access tiering. While broadband providers should be free, in my view, 
to  price  consumer  access  to  the  Internet  differently—setting  a  higher  price,  for  ex-
ample,  for  faster  or  greater  access—they  should  not  be  free  to  apply  discriminatory 
surcharges to those who make content or applications available on the Internet. As 
I testified, in my view, such ‘‘access tiering’’ risks creating a strong incentive among 
Internet providers to favor some companies over others; that incentive in turn tends 
to  support  business  models  that  exploit  scarcity  rather  than  abundance.  If  Google, 
for  example,  knew  if  could  buy  a  kind  of  access  for  its  video  content  that  iFilm 
couldn’t,  then  it  could  exploit  its  advantage  to  create  an  even  greater  disadvantage 
for  its  competitors;  network  providers  in  turn  could  deliver  on  that  disadvantage 
only if the non-privileged service was inferior to the privileged service. 

Put  differently,  ‘‘fast  lanes’’  on  the  Internet  are  only  valuable  if  ‘‘slow  lanes’’  are 
really  slow.  Depending  upon  the  market,  this  fact  can  create  a  perverse  incentive 
among network providers not to build the fastest network possible. 
Conclusion 

As  I  testified  in  2002  and  2006,  the  Internet  was  the  great  economic  surprise  of 
the  20th  century.  No  one  who  funded  or  initially  developed  the  network  imagined 
it would have the economic and social consequences that it has had. 

But  though  the  success  of  the  network  was  a  surprise,  policy-makers  have  yet  to 
learn just why it was a success: Built into its basic design was a guarantee of max-
imum  competition.  A  free  market  in  applications  was  coded  into  its  architecture. 
The growth of that network followed from this basic design. The world economy ben-
efited dramatically from this growth. 

The  threat  facing  the  Internet  today  is  that  network  owners  will  convince  regu-
lators  to  go  back  on  that  original  design.  Through  regulatory  policies  that  permit 
broadband providers to act however their private interests dictate, these regulatory 
policies  would  threaten  the  economic  potential  of  the  network  generally.  New  inno-
vation  always  comes  from  outsiders.  If  insiders  are  given  both  technical  and  legal 
control over innovation on the Internet, innovation will be stifled. 

Unlike  many  other  industrialized  nations,  we  in  the  United  States  have  failed  to 
preserve  the  extraordinary  competition  among  ISPs  that  characterized  early  Inter-
net growth. But despite that loss in access competition, network neutrality still pro-
vided  significant  opportunity  for  application  and  content  competition.  The  changes 
now  being  spoken  of  by  the  effective  duopoly  of  broadband  providers  will  weaken 
that application and content competition.

It is my view that any policy that weakens competition is a policy that will weak-
en the prospects for Internet and economic growth. I therefore urge this Committee 
to  secure  and  supplement  the  work  begun  originally  by  Chairman  Powell,  and  con-
tinued  now  by  Chairman  Martin,  by  enacting  legislation  that  sets  a  clear  policy  to 
protect the environment for Internet innovation and competition. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Dorgan? 
Senator  DORGAN.  Professor,  what  you  just  described,  the  four 
principles  plus  the  nondiscrimination  piece,  is  exactly  what  I  and 
others  described  was  necessary  when  last  we  took  up  this  issue,  I 
believe,  in  a  markup.  And  I  believe  the  vote  was  10  to  10—it  was 
tie  vote,  anyway,  either  11  to  11,  or  10  to  10—to  advance  the 
amendment on net neutrality, or Internet freedom. I want to make 
just a couple of brief comments. 

First of all, I don’t—well, there’s been some discussion here that 
might  lead  someone  to  believe  this—I  don’t  think  this  is  a  discus-
sion, at the moment, about bad actors. There are a lot of good com-
panies out there, they’ve invested a lot of money. I’m going to, this 
evening,  turn  on  a  switch  and  watch  a  great  hockey  game,  I  hope, 
on  television.  I  get  my  Internet  provided  by  the  same  company.  I 
mean,  there  are  a  lot  of  good  companies  out  there  doing  a  lot  of 
things. 

I think it’s also the case, however, that the companies are bigger, 
stronger. I think, when you have fewer competitors, major competi-
tors  in  the  marketplace,  there  is  a  clogging  of  the  arteries  of  the 
marketplace.  And,  Dr.  Hahn  mentioned  antitrust  enforcement.  I 
would  say,  if  anybody  can  find  the  names  of  anybody  that’s  really 
enforcing antitrust laws, be sure and send them here. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  DORGAN.  I’ve  threatened  to  put  the  pictures  of  public 
employees  we’re  paying  for  antitrust  enforcement  on  the  side  of 
milk cartons, because it appears to me that they have vanished for 
a  good  number  of  years.  So,  there  is  no  antitrust  enforcement  of 
any consequence at all. 

I  want  to  ask  a  couple  of  questions.  Obviously,  Mr.  McSlarrow, 
when  you  were  sitting  in  the  audience,  you  would  have  fully  ex-
pected me to ask this question of you. The Chairman of the Federal 
Communications  Commission  comes  to  us  and  says,  ‘‘Here  are  our 
principles,  and  we  believe  we  have  the  authority  to  make  them 
stick.’’  Comcast  says,  ‘‘We  don’t  believe  you  have  the  authority  to 
make  them  stick.  We  don’t  believe  you  have  that  authority  at  all.’’ 
What’s the position of the Cable Association? 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  I  appreciate  the  question,  because  I  think  the 
Chairman is modestly confused. The letter that people have talked 
about from Comcast is very precise. The question posed was wheth-
er or not the FCC has authority today to enjoin conduct under any 
existing  rule.  And  it’s  not  even  a  close  call.  The  answer  is  no.  The 
policy  statement  that  everybody  keeps  talking  about,  which  we 
supported,  in  terms  of  the  principles  embodied  in  it,  is,  by  its 
terms,  not  a  rule  and  not  enforceable.  And  the  Chairman  himself, 
the  day  it  was  issued,  said  it’s  not  an  enforceable  document.  That 
is the question they answer. 

Different  question,  broader  question  going  to  the  one  I  thought 
you  asked  earlier,  whether  or  not  the  FCC  has  generic  authority.

And there, both the Supreme Court and the FCC itself has said it’s 
an  open  question.  They  have  a  proceeding,  where  they  have  teed 
up whether or not, and to what extent, they have ancillary author-
ity to regulate in this space. And I’m not going to assume what the 
answer is, except to say I think they have some authority. It’s prob-
ably  more  limited  than  people  might  imagine.  But,  whether  or  not 
there’s a rule on the books today, there’s—— 

Senator  DORGAN.  Do  you  support—does  your  industry  support 

the four principles? 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  Not  only  do  we  support  the  four  principles, 

they embodied our practice—— 

Senator DORGAN. Do you believe that—— 
Mr. MCSLARROW.—prior to—— 
Senator DORGAN.—they should be enforceable? 
Mr. MCSLARROW.—statement. No. I don’t. 
Senator  DORGAN.  You  support  them,  but  don’t  believe  they 

should be enforceable? 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  No,  I  think  if—if  there  is  anticompetitive  con-
duct  or  deceptive  advertising,  I  think  there  are  rules  on  the  books 
that should and could be enforced. 

Senator DORGAN. Professor Lessig, we’ve heard from some of my 
colleagues and others today, ‘‘Let the marketplace decide. The mar-
ketplace  will  take  care  of  all  this.’’  I  mean,  the  marketplace  is  a 
wonderful allocator of goods and services. Having taught some eco-
nomics,  I  think  it’s  a  terrific  allocator  of  goods  and  services.  But, 
I  also  believe  that  the  marketplace  needs  a  referee  from  time  to 
time. But, ‘‘Let the marketplace decide,’’ what’s wrong with that ar-
gument? 

Mr.  LESSIG.  Well,  the  marketplace  is  extraordinarily  important, 
but  we  have  never,  historically,  relied  upon  the  marketplace  alone 
when  we’re  talking  about  critical  economic  infrastructure  for  the 
Nation. And that’s exactly what the Internet is. The Internet is not 
just  entertainment,  it’s  not  just  like  the  cable  system’s  entertain-
ment  component.  It  is,  instead,  infrastructure.  And  to  make  sure 
that infrastructure encourages the widest range of competition, you 
need to guarantee the platform is open to that competition. 

The  technology  used  to  do  that.  Now  that  the  technology  doesn’t 
do  that,  there’s  an  important  reason  for  the  government  to  insist 
on that neutrality. 

Now,  I  must  insist—my  colleague  Dr.  Hahn  has  uttered  what  is 
a fundamental confusion about what this issue is about, by his ini-
tial  example  about  Oogle  and  whether  Oogle  is  free  to  charge  for 
advertising.  Oogle  is  at  the  edge  of  the  network.  It  is  one  of  the 
competitors  on  the  network.  I  fundamentally  support  the  right  of 
every competitor on the network to discriminate however it wants. 
Let it build its own business model. 

Senator DORGAN. You’re talking about content providers. 
Mr.  LESSIG.  That’s  right.  What  we’re  talking  about  is  the  plat-
form  itself  and  whether  that  highway  should  be  able  to  discrimi-
nate  against  Ford  trucks  in  favor  GM  trucks  or  in  favor  of  Amer-
ican  trucks  versus  Toyota,  foreign  trucks.  The  point  is,  that  high-
way has to be neutral. And that what has encouraged the competi-
tion which defines the growth of the Internet.

Senator DORGAN. I’m going to ask you to respond, Dr. Hahn, but 
I  want  to  ask  you  a  question  as  you  respond,  because  you  started 
by saying, ‘‘What we really need here is just price freedom.’’ So, let 
me  ask  you  this  question.  Let’s  assume  the  American  Enterprise 
Institute  creates  a  site,  because  you  want  to  make  some  money, 
and the site is the American Enterprise Institute for T-Shirt Sales. 
And your popular T-shirt that you’re selling has a slogan that says, 
‘‘Free  Monopolies  from  Regulation.’’  And  the  provider  takes  a  look 
at  that  and  says,  ‘‘You  know,  we  don’t  like  that  you’re  implying 
somehow that we’re a monopoly, so we won’t prevent you from get-
ting  your  site  out,  but  you’re  going  to  have  to  pay  us  a  little  extra 
to  get  your  site  up,  because  we  don’t  like  you  personally,  number 
one;  number  two,  we  don’t  like  the  message  of  your  T-shirt,  and 
we’ve just decided to charge you more in order to get your message 
out.’’  So,  is  that  OK?  I  mean,  the  marketplace  would  then  try  to 
figure out what happens to you? 

Dr.  HAHN.  I  think  the  answer  is  that  you  need  to  look  at  the 
broader  context.  As  you  pointed  out  with  antitrust  earlier,  it’s  im-
portant  to  look  at  the  competitive  structure  of  the  market.  And  in 
this  case,  we’re  talking  about,  I  think,  the  broadband  market.  So, 
let me cite a little data that’s in my testimony. 

Prices  for  digital  subscriber  lines—that’s  DSL  service—dropped 
by  roughly  a  third  between  2001  and  2006.  In  the  case  of  cable 
modem  service,  the  quality-adjusted  price  declined  significantly  as 
cable  connection  speeds  increased  significantly,  while  prices  held 
steady. The FCC reported that highspeed lines increased by 22 per-
cent  during  the  first  half  of  2007,  from  82  million  to  over  100  mil-
lion, following a 27-percent increase, from 65 million to 82 million, 
during the second half of 2006. This strikes me, this suggests to me 
that the industry is subject to a lot of dynamic competition. It’s not 
a perfectly competitive lemonade stand, but we need to look at how 
the industry is actually behaving and what their—— 

Senator DORGAN. But—— 
Dr. HAHN.—incentives to invest are. 
Senator DORGAN. But, Dr. Hahn, you didn’t respond to my ques-
tion. In any event, with response to the statistics you’ve described, 
I could show you data from Asia that shows you pay half as much 
to get ten times the speed. So, I mean, I think that is not germane 
to the question here. 

But, I do ask the question again. Let’s assume that you’ve set up 
your  American  Enterprise  T-Shirt  Shop  because  you  feel  monopo-
lies  are  being  discriminated  against,  you  don’t  want  monopolies  to 
be  regulated,  and  so,  the  service  provider—and,  by  the  way,  there 
aren’t  a  lot  of  service  providers,  you  probably  have  a  choice  of  one 
or  two  in  your  hometown  where  you’re  trying  to  get  this  going— 
and  they  say,  ‘‘You  know,  we  just  don’t  like  you,  personally,  and 
we  don’t  like  your  T-shirts.  We’re  going  to  charge  you  something, 
a little extra than we charge others. That’s our choice. It’s my com-
pany. It’s my choice.’’ What’s wrong with that? 

Dr.  HAHN.  Well,  it  could  violate  antitrust  laws.  You’d  need  to— 
you’d need to take a serious look at that. But, my point is, not only 
do you have robust competition in the broadband market, you have 
competitive  threats  from  wireless  and  satellite,  as  Mr.  McSlarrow

said. So, you need to look at the market in the broader context and 
see what’s actually—— 

Senator  DORGAN.  Well,  Dr.  Hahn,  though,  no  one  would  suggest 
there’s  robust  competition  in  the  marketplace  for  a  good  many 
Americans.  Half  of  North  Dakotans  have  only  two  choices  with  re-
spect  to  providers.  I  mean,  you,  no  one  can  really  suggest  there’s 
robust  competition.  There’s  certainty  robust  competition  out  there 
in  every  direction  with  respect  to  content  providers.  I  mean,  there 
are  people  today,  in  some  garage  someplace,  with  stars  in  their 
eyes, because they’re starting up a company, and they want to pro-
vide  content.  But,  that  is  not  the  case  with  providers.  And  so—— 

Dr. HAHN. It may not—I’m sorry. 
Senator  DORGAN.  Yes,  I  would  ask  a  couple  of  other  questions. 

But, I want you to be able to respond. 

Dr. HAHN. It may not be the case in North Dakota. I concur with 
you.  But,  if  you  look  at  the  pattern  over  time,  there  seems  to  be 
more competition from different kinds of industries. And if you look 
at  major  metropolitan—major  population  centers  throughout  the 
U.S., they’re served by multiple providers, according to the—— 

Senator  DORGAN.  Yes.  Well,  you  know,  we  had  a  hearing  on  a 
different subject recently. We had a guy sit at that table from Cali-
fornia,  and  he  said,  ‘‘In  my  office  in  California’’—he  was  talking 
about  cable  television—‘‘In  my  office  in  California,’’  he  said,  ‘‘we 
have basic tier service with 48 channels’’—and I believe he said 42 
of  them  are  owned  by  the  same  five  or  six  major  companies  that 
we  would  expect.  So,  he  said,  you  know,  this  issue  of  many  voices 
from  one  ventriloquist.  So,  whether  it’s  cable  to  Internet,  we  do 
have  more,  most  everyone  would  say  we  have  more  concentration. 
I  want  to,  without  abusing  my  time,  say,  Mr.  Verrone,  I  wish 
you’d  do  some  writing  for  me  from  time  to  time.  Your  testimony 
was interesting and compelling. 

And, Ms. Bateman, thank you, as well. And I understand that in 
this area of independent material on the Internet and cable and so 
on  coming  from  independence  is  dramatically  decreased.  So,  I  un-
derstand  the  question  that  you  pose  to  this  committee  about  com-
petition  on  the  side  of  those  that  are  trying  to  continue  to  provide 
content. 

You want to respond, either you or Ms. Bateman? 
Mr.  VERRONE.  Well,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  complimenting  my 
testimony.  I  just  hope  my  staff  has  run  out  and  reserved  the  URL 
for Oogle.com, because I have a feeling it’s going to be popular after 
Dr. Hahn’s testimony. 

Clearly, when we talk about the fundamental considerations here 
of  competition,  and  when  you’re  dealing  in  the  industry  in  which 
Ms. Bateman and I work, we’ve found, over the past 20 years, that 
there’s  been  a  consolidation  of  the  distribution.  When  the  produc-
tion  and  distribution  providers  congeal  and  consolidate,  then  you 
limit  the  independent  voices.  And  one  of  the  arguments  made  at 
the  time  was,  ‘‘Well,  you  know,  there’s  the  Internet.  Just  because 
the  same  people  own  cable  and  broadcast  and  satellite  and—well, 
you can always go out and get access and get your views published 
through the Internet.‘‘ And now it’s a case of some of the same com-
panies with whom we were bargaining during our negotiation that 
are  looking  now  to  control  that  content  distribution.  And  so,  it  is,

it  is  very  much  of  a  piece  of  media  consolidation  in  this  country 
and on this planet that the Internet be protected as a free and open 
means of expression. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  a  vote  has  now  started,  and  I 
will  submit  a  series  of  questions  to  witnesses,  and  ask  that  they 
respond in writing. 

But, I do just want to say that the substantial increased consoli-
dation,  and  that’s  undeniable,  there’s  just  dramatic  consolidation; 
that’s another subject that I’ve been involved in. It does require, it 
seems  to  me,  without  tarnishing  everybody  as  bad  actors—that’s 
not  the  intent,  it’s  not  my  intent—it  does  require  us,  however,  as 
a governing body to thoughtfully regulate. Not to inhibit, not to try 
to  stop  innovation,  but  to  thoughtfully  regulate  on  behalf  of  the 
public interest. The public interest here is important. 

So, I want us to progress. I want us to be a country that has the 
best access in the world, the best content, and have companies that 
provide  us  wonderful  things  as  we  want  to  access  Internet  and 
cable  and  so  on.  But,  I  do  think  there’s  an  essential  need  here— 
and  I  think  we’ve  described  it  this  morning  with  the  Chairman  of 
the  FCC,  and  the  need  to  have  some  certain  regulatory  capability. 
And I hope this hearing demonstrates that. 

I apologize that we have less time than we had hoped, but I will 

submit questions in writing. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Klobuchar? 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am 

up against the vote, so I’ll try my best, here. 

Professor Lessig, in your remarks, or your prepared remarks, you 
talked  about  how,  ’’Unlike  other  industrialized  nations,  we,  in  the 
United  States,  have  failed  to  provide  the  high  level  of  competition 
among  Internet  service  providers  that  characterized  early  Internet 
growth.‘‘  And  could  you  talk  a  little  bit  more  about  that  and  what 
other  industrialized  nations  are  doing  that  we  aren’t  doing?  And 
how  does  your  own  view  of  this  relative  lack  of  competition  affect 
this debate? 

Mr.  LESSIG.  Sure.  So,  our  competitors—Japan  and  Europe,  in 
particular—adopted  essentially  the  regulatory  strategy  that  we 
adopted in 1996. But, in Japan, in particular, they made that regu-
latory  strategy  actually  work.  So,  it  sustained  enormous  competi-
tion  among  ISPs,  providing  increasing  service  at  lower  cost  for 
broadband access. And so, in Japan right now, there’s a significant 
opportunity  to  select  among  competitors  if  your  broadband  service 
is  no  good  or  you  don’t  like  the  blocking  that’s  existing  on  the 
broadband  service.  And  that’s  a  critical  part  of  what’s  made  that 
market work so well. 

The United States adopted a different strategy. We backed away 
from the open access requirements that were originally part of the 
vision  for  broadband  provision  on  Title  II,  and  never  imposed  it 
under  Title  VI,  and  one  predicted  consequence  of  that  would  be, 
we’d  have  exactly  the  consolidation  that  we’ve  had.  And  now,  I 
think it’s just not credible to assert that there’s real competition in 
access to broadband at the fast levels that we’re talking about.

In  my  city,  San  Francisco,  not  a  backwater,  even  though  I  come 
from  South  Dakota,  not  a  backwater  in  provision;  I  have  one 
choice—exactly one choice—for fast broadband, and that’s cable. So, 
we have lost that competitive opportunity. 

And  just  recognize  how  much  more  difficult  that  makes  Chair-
man Martin’s job; because when you don’t have competition among 
ISPs,  then,  when  there’s  a  problem,  the  only  choice  the  consumer 
has is to come to the government and say to the—— 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Well—— 
Mr. LESSIG.—government—— 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.—how  about  this  idea  that  I  think  Mr. 
McSlarrow  was  referencing,  and  maybe  in  discussions  I’ve  had, 
that wireless and satellite companies will enhance competition? Do 
you think that that’s true, that that will eventually happen? 

Mr.  LESSIG.  I  don’t  think  that  the  satellite  is  going  to  deal  ade-
quately  with  the  latency  problem,  with  the  slowness  problem  for 
certain applications. It might be that wireless, if deployed correctly, 
will. But, still, we need to recognize, it’s a tiny fraction of 1 percent 
right  now  out  there,  and  we  need  to  have  real  competition  in  the 
major  markets  right  now  in  order  to  get  the  kind  of  growth  that 
is necessary. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And  do  you  think  that—I’d  say  this  does. 
I’m  very  interested  in  wireless  providers,  and  have  been  working 
on  this  Cell  Phone  Bill  of  Rights.  Currently,  the  FCC  doesn’t  have 
a  consistent  policy  that  applies  to  the  different  platforms  when  it 
comes  to  this.  And  if  Congress  is  going  to  maximize  the  value  of 
Internet  policies,  do  you  think  that  these  policies  should  apply  to 
both wired and wireless Internet providers? 

Mr. LESSIG. I do. I think the open-access requirement that’s been 
suggested, in the context of wireless, would be very good to encour-
age  lots  of  competition  here.  Now,  the  contexts  are  different.  The 
platform in wireless was never the neutral, open platform that the 
Internet  was.  So,  in  the  Internet  context,  we’re  talking  about  pre-
serving  something.  In  the  wireless  context,  we’re  talking  about 
adding  a  kind  of  open  access—openness.  But,  I  think  it  would  be 
valuable  to  do  it,  especially  because  Congress  has  not  supported 
the  idea  of  expanding  the  amount  of  unlicensed  wireless.  The 
greatest  growth  in  applications  in  wireless  has  been,  for  example, 
in  the  Wi-Fi  space,  unlicensed  wireless  spectrum.  And  by  not  en-
couraging  a  wider  growth  in  that,  I  think  that  we  risk  not  using 
the wireless technology in the most efficient way to spur broadband 
growth. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  I’m  just—and,  Dr.  Hahn,  maybe  you’re 
going  to  comment  on  this,  but  you  know,  seeing  my  daughter,  at 
age  12,  and  her  friends,  legally  downloading  some  of  these  things 
and all these movies at once, and all these things—I do understand 
why you could suddenly have this sudden rush on the system. And 
one  of  things  I  wanted  you—I  know  you’re  going  to  answer  what 
he  said,  but  could  you  talk  about—a  little  bit  about  the  fast  lane 
and  the  slow  lanes,  and  how  fast  the  fast  lane  is,  compared  to  the 
slow  lane?  I  always  seem  to  be  on  the  slow  lane.  So,  that’s  why  I 
was wondering. 

Dr. HAHN. So do I. Can I respond to Professor—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Yes.

Dr. HAHN.—Lessig and your question, first? 
I’m  currently  working  on  this  problem,  related  to  openness  and 
wireless.  And  I  suspect  that  several  other  economists  are,  as  well. 
And my own view is that it wouldn’t be prudent to make public pol-
icy decisions before we actually have a serious cost-benefit analysis 
of this issue. And one hasn’t been done yet. 

But,  I  believe  the  economic  impacts  of  a  requirement  to  have— 
of an openness requirement in the wireless space, which is already 
an intensely competitive space, by any measure, is likely to raise— 
likely  to  be  to  raise  basic  cellular  rates.  So,  I  think  you  want  to 
look  at  that  really,  really  closely  before  you  do  that,  because  that 
could have adverse income—— 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. OK. 
Dr. HAHN.—implications. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. And the fast lane/slow lane? 
Dr. HAHN. On your fast lane—give me your question—— 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  How  much  faster  is  the  fast  lane?  What’s 

the difference between them? 

Dr. HAHN. Well, it depends. I mean, I know some people who ac-

tually use dial-up modem, so there’s a huge difference. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Yes. 
Dr.  HAHN.  But,  one  point  I’m—wanted  to  make  with  respect  to 
fast lane and slow lane—I realize discrimination is a politically in-
correct  word,  at  least  in  this  chamber,  but  from  an  economist’s 
point  of  view,  they  don’t  necessarily  view  it  as  a  bad  thing.  And, 
in  fact,  there  is  already  discrimination  out  there.  If  you  were—if 
you  were  asked,  ‘‘Do  you  want  a  very  fast  lane?’’  from  one  of  the 
Internet  service  providers,  you’d  have  to  pay  a  few  dollars  more  a 
month than if you want the medium-fast lane. So, we do have some 
forms  of  discrimination  now,  and  it—we  have  forms  of  price  dis-
crimination  all  over  the  place,  and  economists  generally  view  it  as 
a  reasonable  way  of  paying  for  the  fixed  costs  of  investments  and 
giving  firms  an  incentive  to  invest  in  future  broadband  networks. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Well—— 
Dr. HAHN. So, it has positive, as well as negative, impacts. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you. 
I  just  have  one  last  question.  I’ll,  maybe,  submit  some  more,  be-

cause we have this vote going on. 

But, of you, Ms. Bateman—I’m a former prosecutor, so I’m inter-
ested  in  sort  of  a  different  issue  on  the  future  of  the  Internet, 
which  is  the  ability  of  the  creative  community  to  ensure  that  your 
content is protected and is not going to be used in violation of copy-
right laws and otherwise stolen or pirated or co-opted. And I know 
that  you  talked—I  don’t  know  if  you  talked  about  it,  I  came  in  at 
the  tail  end  of  your  remarks,  but  in  your  prepared  remarks,  about 
the  digital  watermarking  could  be  the  solution  to  prevent  piracy. 
Do you want to talk a little bit about that? 

Ms. BATEMAN. I’m not as well versed on the technological aspects 
of those, but I know there are—I mean, I think, from the first day 
that  the  VCR  machine  was  introduced,  there  were  concerns  about, 
you know, taking the data off the initial delivery system and shar-
ing  it  with  other  people.  So,  I  can’t  answer  that  question,  techno-
logically,  but  I  do  know  that  there  are  ways  to  countermand  that, 
financially,  by,  you  know,  having  relationships  with  sponsors  and 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:29 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 074893 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74893.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

so  forth.  And,  in  that  sense,  you  would  want—actually  want  your 
stuff  scraped  and  put  on  other  servers,  so  that  that  sponsor’s  ads 
or embedded—or incorporated product is spread around. 

I understand that there are some people who wouldn’t want that 
to  happen.  And  it’s  an  ongoing  problem,  and  it’s  a  problem  with 
CDs  and,  like  I  said,  tapes  and  DVDs,  and  it’s  not  just  the  Inter-
net. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you very much. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Ms.  Combs,  Dr.  Hahn,  President  Verrone,  Ms. 
Bateman,  President  McSlarrow,  and  Professor  Lessig,  on  behalf  of 
the Committee, we thank you very much. Because of the constraint 
of time, we will have to adjourn at this moment, but I will be sub-
mitting  questions  to  all  of  you.  I  hope  you  can  get  a  response  to

please feel free to do so.

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 
Thank  you,  Chairman  Inouye  and  Vice  Chairman  Stevens  for  calling  this  impor-

tant hearing. 

There  are  a  number  of  critical  issues  when  discussing  the  future  of  the  Internet; 
one  is  Internet  governance.  What  should  the  role  of  Internet  Corporation  for  As-
signed Names and Numbers (ICANN) be and what should the role of the U.S. Gov-
ernment be within ICANN? 

Another  series  of  questions  surround  IPV6,  the  successor  to  the  current  version 
of  the  Internet  Protocol,  for  general  use  on  the  Internet.  Why  is  the  new  protocol’s 
adoption  so  slow?  And,  taking  a  step  further  back,  how  critical  is  its  adoption  in 
the first place to the continued growth of the Internet? 

And  then  there  is  Internet  security,  Internet  safety,  Internet  privacy,  Internet 
pricing  models,  Internet  advertising,  more  broadly,  Internet  monetization,  and  the 
list goes on and on. 

But  the  most  fundamental  issue  regarding  the  future  of  the  Internet  is  how  to 
ensure that consumers in all part of the country have a choice of multiple, independ-
ently-owned providers for high-speed Internet access. 

For  example,  if  there  is  a  well-functioning  market  for  residential  consumer 
broadband  services,  the  discussion  over  net  neutrality  would  take  on  a  different 
tone.  In  an  efficient  market,  if  a  consumer  doesn’t  like  the  price  or  the  terms  of 
service,  he  or  she  can  walk  over  to  a  competitor.  In  today’s  market,  by  contrast, 
most  consumers  have  one  or  two  independent  choices  for  broadband.  These 
broadband  providers  have  a  huge  amount  of  market  power  and  consumers  do  not 
have much recourse. 

Such  limited  choices  limit  the  value  of  greater  disclosure  by  broadband  providers 
regarding things such as its network management practices. If a consumer believes 
the practices cited in the small print are restrictive and unreasonable, they may get 
upset, but what options do they really have in a market plagued by imperfect com-
petition? 

And that leads me to net neutrality. 
I  appreciate  the  fact  that  a  broadband  provider  will  be  limited  in  the  rate  of  re-
turn  it  can  provide  its  shareholders  if  all  it  provides  consumers  is  the  commodity 
transport  of  packets.  I  realize  that  these  providers  now  typically  bundle  broadband 
access with voice, video, and data services riding over the broadband connection. 

I also understand that there is a need for reasonable network management to en-
sure  quality  of  service  to  customers.  Sometimes  each  class  of  packets—voice,  video, 
and  data—needs  to  be  treated  differently.  And,  sometimes  the  system  architecture 
used by the broadband provider places unique constraints on the system. But, with-
out transparency, who’s to say what is reasonable? 

So, where do you draw the line? 
A  few  years  back,  the  FCC  issued  its  four  net  neutrality  principles.  At  the  time 
they  were  released,  it  was  clear  that  these  were  principles  and  they  were  not  en-
forceable.  While  the  Commission  does  have  ancillary  authority  under  Title  I  of  the 
Communications Act, it is a real stretch to claim that it can be applied to enforcing 
the  net  neutrality  principles.  Given  this  reality,  I  was  not  surprised,  when  a  cable 
system  operator  recently  criticized  for  using  network  management  practices  con-
trary  to  the  net  neutrality  principles,  replied,  in  effect,  the  emperor  has  no  clothes. 
This  company’s  response  only  confirms  the  need  of  a  fifth,  enforceable  net  neu-
trality  principle  of  non-discrimination.  It  could  be  as  simple  as  the  amendment  of-
fered by Senators Snowe and Dorgan during the mark up of the Telecommunication 
Act of 2006. 

With  enforceable  non-discrimination  language,  there  will  be  a  greater  level  of 
trust  by  consumers  and  businesses  that  a  broadband  provider’s  network  manage-
ment practices are just that—network management.

No  need  to  remind  anyone  here  that  the  Internet  has  thrived,  in  large  part,  be-
cause  innovation  has  always  been  on  the  edge  of  the  network  and  did  not  have  to 
be blessed by the network operator. We should keep it that way. 

If  network  operators,  under  the  guise  of  network  management,  assert  a  stronger 
role,  you  will  see  their  business  arrangements  squeeze  out  innovation  by  unaffili-
ated  parties.  The  temptation  may  prove  to  be  too  strong.  And  when  Internet  start- 
ups  seek  venture  capital  funding,  investors  will  be  hard-pressed  to  consider  any 
company not affiliated with a network operator. 

Of  even  greater  concern  is  for  the  potential  for  broadband  network  operators  to 
leverage  control  over  the  transmission  of  packets  through  their  network  and  act  as 
a gatekeeper for content. While I oppose the illegal distribution of copyrighted mate-
rial, this is just not the right way of going about it. It raises a whole host of privacy 
concerns and will no doubt lead to protracted litigation. 

I look forward to hearing from the panel. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BYRON L. DORGAN TO 

HON. KEVIN J. MARTIN 

Question  1.  Recently,  Comcast  announced  that  it  is  engaging  in  conversations 
with  Bit  Torrent,  Inc.  and  Pando  Networks,  which  distribute  content  through  Bit 
Torrent applications. 

a.  Does  this  demonstrate  that  the  marketplace  is  addressing  the  concerns  raised 

by consumers? 

tiny? 

b. Do you think that the response may have been influenced by the political scru-

c. Do deals cut with these individual companies solve the problem? 
Answer. I am pleased that Comcast has reversed course and agreed that it is not 
a  reasonable  network  management  practice  to  arbitrarily  block  certain  applications 
on  its  network.  I  also  commend  the  company  for  admitting  publicly  that  it  was  en-
gaging in the practice and now engaging in a dialog with BitTorrent. Unfortunately, 
Comcast originally disavowed any knowledge of any action to block certain applica-
tions on its network and only came forward after repeated requests and heightened 
public scrutiny. 

I  hope  that  the  negotiations  will  result  in  a  solution  that  preserves  consumers’ 
ability  to  access  any  lawful  Internet  content  and  applications  of  their  choice.  That 
ability is fundamental to preserving the open marketplace and innovation that char-
acterizes the Internet. 

I am concerned, though, that Comcast has not made clear when they will stop this 
discriminatory  practice.  It  appears  this  practice  will  continue  throughout  the  coun-
try  until  the  end  of  the  year  and  in  some  markets,  even  longer.  While  it  may  take 
time  to  implement  its  preferred  new  traffic  management  technique,  it  is  not  at  all 
obvious  why  Comcast  couldn’t  stop  its  current  practice  of  arbitrarily  blocking  its 
broadband  customers  from  using  certain  applications.  Comcast  should  provide  its 
broadband  customers  as  well  as  the  Commission  with  a  commitment  of  a  date  cer-
tain  by  when  it  will  stop  this  practice.  Unless  and  until  it  does  so,  it  is  ignoring 
the concerns raised by consumers. 

I  believe  that  the  Commission  must  remain  vigilant  in  protecting  consumers’  ac-
cess to content on the internet. Thus, it is critically important that the Commission 
take  seriously  and  respond  to  complaints  that  are  filed  about  arbitrary  limits  on 
broadband access and potential violations of our principles. 

Question  2.  In  the  last  Congress,  when  this  Committee  was  considering  network 
neutrality  legislation  in  the  telecom  legislation,  the  phone  and  cable  companies  ar-
gued  that  Congress  did  not  need  to  enact  rules  of  the  road  to  protect  consumers 
from  discrimination.  They  stated  that  they  would  never  censor  political  speech  or 
block  lawful  applications  and  content.  They  said  that  consumers’  concerns  about 
such  bad  behavior  was  unfounded  and  was  a  ‘‘solution  in  search  of  a  problem.’’  We 
now  have  seen  some  high  profile  examples  of  network  operators  censoring  speech 
and  blocking  applications.  Are  the  concerns  that  were  raised  last  year  still  a  ‘‘solu-
tion in search of a problem?’’ 

Answer.  As  the  expert  communications  agency,  it  was  appropriate  for  the  Com-
mission  to  adopt,  and  it  is  the  Commission’s  role  to  enforce,  its  Internet  Policy 
Statement.  Indeed,  on  several  occasions,  the  entire  Commission  has  reiterated  that 
it has the authority and will enforce these current principles. 

In  2007,  the  Commission  committed  to  enforcing  our  existing  principles  and  the 

policy statement. Specifically, in April 2007, the Commission expressly stated:

67 

The  Commission,  under  Title  I  of  the  Communications  Act,  has  the  ability  to 
adopt and enforce the net neutrality principles it announced in the Internet Pol-
icy  Statement.  The  Supreme  Court  reaffirmed  that  the  Commission  ‘‘has  juris-
diction to impose additional regulatory obligations under its Title I ancillary ju-
risdiction  to  regulate  interstate  and  foreign  communications.’’  Indeed,  the  Su-
preme  Court  specifically  recognized  the  Commission’s  ancillary  jurisdiction  to 
impose regulatory obligations on broadband Internet access providers.1 

I  believe  that  the  Commission  has  a  responsibility  to  enforce  the  principles  that 
it  has  already  adopted.  Indeed,  the  Commission  has  already  taken  enforcement  ac-
tion  in  response  to  other  complaints.  In  the  Madison  River  complaint,  the  Commis-
sion ordered a telephone company to stop blocking VoIP calls. 

Unfortunately, as you point out, there have been several incidents or problems in 
which  carriers  have  been  accused  of  blocking  applications.  I  believe  that  the  Com-
mission  must  remain  vigilant  in  protecting  consumers’  access  to  content  on  the 
internet. Thus, it is critically important that the Commission take seriously and re-
spond to these complaints that are filed about arbitrary limits on broadband access 
and potential violations of our principles. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. TED STEVENS TO 

HON. KEVIN J. MARTIN 

Question  1.  Is  the  FCC  aware  of  any  instances  where  an  operator  has  discrimi-

nated against content on a religious or political point of view? 

Answer.  In  September  2007,  the  press  reported  that  Verizon  Wireless  rejected  a 
request  from  NARAL  Pro-Choice  America  to  make  Verizon’s  mobile  network  avail-
able  for  a  text-message  program  that  allowed  people  to  sign  up  for  text  messages 
from NARAL. The activities attributed to Verizon Wireless, however, involved wire-
less  text  messages  rather  than  access  to  Internet  content.  The  Commission  has 
sought  public  comment  on  a  Petition  for  Declaratory  Ruling  filed  by  several  public 
interest groups to clarify the regulatory status of text messaging services, including 
short-code based services sent from and received by mobile phones. 

In  addition,  it  has  been  reported  in  the  press  that  AT&T  muted  remarks  made 
by singer Eddie Vedder of the rock group Pearl Jam criticizing President Bush dur-
ing a live Webcast of a Pearl Jam performance. 

Question  2.  Given  the  size,  complexity  and  cost  of  the  broadband  networks,  how 
quickly  can  a  network  operator  reasonably  be  expected  to  migrate  to  new  manage-
ment technologies? At what cost? 

Answer. The Commission has the dual responsibilities of creating an environment 
that  promotes  infrastructure  investment  and  broadband  deployment  and  to  ensure 
that  consumers’  access  to  content  on  the  Internet  is  protected.  In  order  to  meet 
these responsibilities, I intend to explore more fully what constitutes reasonable net-
work  management  practices,  including  the  important  ability  for  network  managers 
to  block  the  distribution  of  illegal  content,  including  pirated  movies  and  music  and 
child  pornography.  I  note,  however,  that  the  Commission  has  not  mandated  the 
adoption of any particular network management technology. 

Question  3.  What  are  the  unique  challenges  that  are  faced  by  smaller  rural  pro-
viders who may have more stringent capacity issues—is this an area where one size 
fits all? 

Answer.  The  Commission  has  not  mandated  the  adoption  of  any  particular  net-
work management technology and we would need to consider all of the facts includ-
ing  the  capacity  issues  and  unique  challenges  of  rural  carriers.  Rather,  I  intend  to 
explore  more  fully  what  constitutes  reasonable  network  management  practices,  in-
cluding the important ability for network managers to block the distribution of ille-
gal content, including pirated movies and music and child pornography.

HON. KEVIN J. MARTIN 

Question 1. The FCC has held two hearings, one at Harvard and one at Stanford, 
to  hear  from  expert  panelists  regarding  broadband  network  management  practices. 
At Harvard, you mentioned that service providers should be allowed to take reason-
able  steps  to  make  efficient  use  of  their  networks  but  that  such  management  poli-

cies  must  be  disclosed.  Many  witnesses  at  that  hearing  also  voiced  concern  about 
the  lack  of  disclosure  and  transparency.  Since  the  Comcast-BitTorrent  incident, 
Comcast  has  revised  its  terms  of  service  and  issued  a  new  acceptable  use  policy. 
Does this change in Comcast’s TOS provide enough information to consumers or de-
velopers  that  may  want  to  create  new  applications  or  services  to  work  over  the 
Comcast network? 

Answer.  First,  the  Commission  still  has  the  Comcast  complaint  in  front  of  it.  I 
was pleased that Comcast has reversed course and agreed that it is not a reasonable 
network  management  practice  to  arbitrarily  block  certain  applications  on  its  net-
work.  I  also  commended  the  company  for  admitting  publicly  that  it  was  engaging 
in  the  practice  and  for  engaging  in  a  dialog  with  BitTorrent.  I  am  concerned, 
though,  that  Comcast  has  not  made  clear  when  they  will  stop  this  discriminatory 
practice. It appears this practice will continue throughout the country until the end 
of the year and in some markets, even longer. 

I  have  proposed  a  framework  for  analyzing  complaints  and  concerns  about  net-
work  management  practices  by  broadband  operators.  First,  the  Commission  should 
consider whether the network management practices are intended to distinguish be-
tween legal and illegal activity. The Commission’s network principles only recognize 
and  protect  users’  access  to  legal  content.  Second,  the  Commission  should  consider 
whether the network service provider adequately disclosed its network management 
practices.  A  hallmark  of  whether  something  is  reasonable  is  whether  an  operator 
is  willing  to  disclose  fully  and  exactly  what  they  are  doing.  Adequate  disclosure  of 
the  particular  traffic  management  tools  and  techniques—not  only  to  consumers  but 
also  to  the  designers  of  various  applications  and  entrepreneurs—is  critical.  Finally, 
the  Commission  should  consider  whether  the  network  management  technique  arbi-
trarily blocks or degrades a particular application. 

If  a  network  management  practice  selectively  identifies  particular  applications  or 
content for differential treatment, the Commission should evaluate the practice with 
heightened  scrutiny,  with  the  network  operator  bearing  the  burden  of  dem-
onstrating  that  the  particular  practice  furthered  an  important  interest,  and  that  it 
was narrowly tailored to service that interest. 

Question 1a. Can the company provide more disclosure and not infringe upon pro-
prietary  or  sensitive  company  information  that  would  be  useful  to  consumers  and 
developers? 

Answer. While we have not yet acted on the Comcast complaint, adequate disclo-
sure of the particular traffic management tools and techniques must be provided to 
the designers of various applications and entrepreneurs. 

Question  2.  The  Commission  is  still  investigating  complaints  regarding  the 
Comcast-BitTorrent blocking or degrading incident and has yet to determine wheth-
er the actions violated the FCC’s principles protecting consumer access to the Inter-
net.  However,  you  stated  with  respect  to  the  incident  it  does  not  appear  that  cable 
modem  subscribers  had  the  ability  to  do  anything  they  wanted  on  the  Internet,  it 
wasn’t  content  agnostic,  and  the  questionable  network  management  technique  was 
being triggered regardless of the actual levels of congestion at that particular time. 
Given  this  evidence  and  the  testimony  of  the  various  witnesses  at  your  two  hear-
ings,  it  seems  as  if  the  activities  of  Comcast  were  in  clear  violation  of  at  least  two 
of the FCC’s principles—‘‘Consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content 
of their choice’’ and ‘‘are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice,’’ 
does the Commission agree? 

Answer.  The  Commission  is  still  investigating  these  complaints  and  we  have  not 
yet  determined  whether  the  actions  violated  our  principles  protecting  consumer  ac-
cess to the Internet. However, Comcast appears to have utilized Internet equipment 
from Sandvine or something similar that is widely known to be a relatively inexpen-
sive,  blunt  means  to  reduce  peer-to-peer  traffic  by  blocking  certain  traffic  com-
pletely.  In  contrast,  more  modern  equipment  can  be  finely  tuned  to  slow  traffic  to 
certain speeds based on various levels of congestion. Specifically, this equipment: (1) 
blocks  certain  attempts  by  subscribers  to  upload  information  using  particular  legal 
peer-to-peer  applications  by  pretending  to  be  the  subscriber’s  computer  and  fal-
sifying  a  ‘‘reset’’  packet  to  end  the  communication,  and  (2)  degrades  the  cor-
responding  attempts  to  download  information  using  the  same  peer-to-peer  applica-
tions. 

Based on the testimony we have received thus far, I think it is important to clar-
ify a few points. Contrary to some claims, it does not appear that cable modem sub-
scribers  had  the  ability  to  do  anything  they  wanted  on  the  Internet.  Specifically, 
based  on  the  testimony  we  have  received  thus  far,  some  users  were  not  able  to 
upload anything they wanted and were unable to fully use certain file sharing soft-
ware  from  peer-to-peer  networks.  Contrary  to  some  claims,  it  does  not  appear  that 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:29 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 074893 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74893.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

69 

this  technique  was  used  only  to  occasionally  delay  traffic  at  particular  nodes  suf-
fering  from  network  congestion  at  that  time.  Indeed,  based  on  the  testimony  we 
have received thus far, this equipment is typically deployed over a wider geographic 
or system area and would therefore have impacted numerous nodes within a system 
simultaneously.  Moreover,  the  equipment  apparently  used  does  not  appear  to  have 
the  ability  to  know  when  an  individual  cable  segment  is  congested.  It  appears  that 
this  equipment  blocks  the  uploads  of  at  least  a  large  portion  of  subscribers  in  that 
part  of  the  network,  regardless  of  the  actual  levels  of  congestion  at  that  particular 
time.  Finally,  contrary  to  some  claims,  it  is  not  clear  when  they  will  actually  stop 
using their current approach. They claim that they will deploy this new solution by 
the  end  of  the  year  but  it  is  unclear  whether  they  will  be  finished  deploying  their 
solution  or  just  starting  that  migration.  Indeed  the  question  is  not  when  they  will 
begin using a new approach but if and when they are committing to stop using the 
old one. 

Question  3.  It  seems  unclear  when  Comcast  will  actually  stop  using  their  ques-
tionable  approach  to  network  management.  The  broadband  provider  has  vaguely 
claimed they will deploy a new network management solution by the end of the year 
but it seems as if they are continuing to use their current method. What is the Com-
mission’s time-frame with concluding its investigation? 

Answer. I am hopeful that the Commission will conclude its investigation into the 

Comcast complaint by this summer. 

Question  4.  Isn’t  it  concerning  that  Comcast  is  continuing  to  employ  discrimina-
tory network management practices, which many experts have called unreasonable? 
Answer. I am concerned that Comcast has not made clear when they will stop this 
discriminatory  practice.  It  appears  this  practice  will  continue  throughout  the  coun-
try  until  the  end  of  the  year  and  in  some  markets,  even  longer.  While  it  may  take 
time  to  implement  its  preferred  new  traffic  management  technique,  it  is  not  at  all 
obvious  why  Comcast  couldn’t  stop  its  current  practice  of  arbitrarily  blocking  its 
broadband  customers  from  using  certain  applications.  Comcast  should  provide  its 
broadband  customers  as  well  as  the  Commission  with  a  commitment  of  a  date  cer-
tain by when it will stop this practice. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

DR. ROBERT HAHN 

Question  1.  Since  2003,  the  FCC  has  been  reclassifying  broadband  services  as 
Title I services under the Communications Act. In 2005, the Supreme Court upheld 
this  approach  in  its  Brand  X  decision.  In  light  of  the  FCC’s  reclassification  of 
broadband  services  and  the  Supreme  Court  subsequently  deciding  that  this  ap-
proach  passes  legal  muster,  do  you  believe  the  FCC  has  adequate  authority  to  stop 
broadband network providers from engaging in unfair discrimination? 

Answer.  Let  me  preface  my  remarks  by  saying  that  I  am  an  economist  and  not 
a  lawyer.  I  do  believe  that  the  FCC  has  adequate  authority.  I  also  believe  that,  to 
the extent there are antitrust issues, the FTC and DOJ can play constructive roles. 
Question 2. Broadband capacity plays an important role in the network neutrality 
and network management discussion. To this end, I would like to ask two questions: 
Can  we  worry  less  about  discrimination  or  content  favoritism  if  there  is  more 
broadband network capacity? 

Answer. This question avoids the most critical question in the broadband debate— 
namely, what is the most efficient way in which network owners can expand capac-
ity.  A  ‘‘dumb’’  large  pipe  that  treats  all  packets  the  same  may  cost  significantly 
more  than  an  intelligent  smaller  pipe  that  prioritizes  some  traffic  over  others.  The 
higher  costs  associated  with  the  dumb  pipe  will  likely  be  passed  on  to  broadband 
subscribers  in  the  form  of  higher  monthly  subscription  fees.  Regulators  should  not 
mandate this outcome because it would likely be inefficient and hurt consumers. 

Question  2a.  Can  broadband  network  providers  add  capacity  fast  enough  to  meet 

consumer demand? 

Answer.  In  the  absence  of  a  market  failure,  regulators  should  not  concern  them-
selves  with  such  issues.  The  market  can  be  counted  on  to  satisfy  demand.  Some  of 
the legislative proposals limiting pricing freedom are likely to slow the introduction 
of innovative technologies that can best meet consumer demands.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. TED STEVENS TO 

DR. ROBERT HAHN 

Question 1. Who benefits from network neutrality regulation? 
Answer. This depends on the kind of network neutrality regulation. If we assume 
net neutrality regulation prevents a platform provider from charging a content pro-
vider  a  positive  price  for  enhanced  quality  of  service,  then  my  sense  is  that  there 
would be three important economic impacts: (1) Higher bills for end users (i.e., con-
sumers  and  businesses  that  use  the  Internet  will  likely  pay  more  than  they  would 
otherwise  because  the  platform  provider  cannot  recover  costs  of  the  network  from 
the  content  providers);  (2)  Fewer  applications  that  depend  on  enhanced  quality  of 
service  would  come  to  market;  and  (3)  Some  content  providers  would  benefit  who 
do  not  need  a  higher  quality  of  service  because  they  would  not  be  charged  by  the 
platform for providing end users with access to their content. 

Regarding item (1), more research needs to be done to estimate the economic im-
pacts on consumers, but preliminary research I have done with Hal Singer suggests 
that the adverse price impacts on end users could be substantial. 

Regarding item (2), consumers who desire applications that require a higher qual-
ity of service to perform effectively will be less likely to have that opportunity with 
net  neutrality  regulation.  Examples  include  online  gaming  and  telemedicine.  There 
would  be  social  losses  and  losses  to  consumers  from  a  reduction  in  investments 
aimed at improving quality of service. 

Question  2.  Net  neutrality  proponents  argue  one  set  of  rules  for  everyone,  but 
doesn’t network neutrality impact different consumers differently and different net-
works differently? 

Answer.  The  impact  of  particular  regulations  is  an  empirical  question.  Nonethe-
less,  I  think  it  is  fair  to  say  that  different  consumers  will  be  impacted  differently 
as  will  different  networks.  I  would  need  to  have  more  precise  economic  data  to  say 
more about this. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE TO 

DR. ROBERT HAHN 

Question  1.  It  has  been  stated  numerous  times  that  there  isn’t  sufficient 
broadband  ISP  competition.  While  some  markets  (more  metropolitan  and  urban 
areas) do have robust competition, most markets have an effective duopoly that con-
trols  access  to  high  speed  Internet  connections.  How  would  you  assess  the  current 
direction  of  broadband  competition  given  the  emergence  of  wireless  broadband  and 
broadband over power lines (BPL) services? Is competition growing? 

Answer.  This  depends  on  how  you  define  competition.  Data  I  cited  in  my  testi-
mony,  contained  in  the  FCC  reports,  suggest  that  competition  in  the  wireline 
broadband  space  is  growing.  Moreover,  competition  between  wireline  and  wireless 
networks  is  growing.  So,  for  example,  I  may  use  a  BlackBerry  to  get  my  e-mail  or 
access the Internet, and I might also use my mobile phone. My view of the general 
‘‘broadband market’’ is that it is highly dynamic and consumers are benefiting. I cite 
price and quality of service data in my testimony that makes this point. 

Question 2. Why isn’t there more competition in the Broadband space? What bar-

riers to entry are hindering new entrants? 

Answer.  I  see  a  lot  of  competition  in  the  broadband  space.  In  my  testimony  and 
in  AEI-Brookings  publications,  I  make  suggestions  on  lowering  some  barriers  to 
entry.  One  area  that  could  lead  to  greater  competition  in  broadband  is  the  auc-
tioning off of more spectrum to the private sector. 

Question  3.  What  specific  recommendations  do  you  have  for  us  to  craft  effective 

policy that would promote more competition in this market space? 

Answer.  Let’s  recognize  that  regulation  that  aims  to  prevent  a  platform  owner 
from  contracting  with  a  website  for  enhanced  quality  of  service  at  a  positive  price 
will  not  likely  generate  more  competition  among  platform  owners.  Let’s  also  recog-
nize  that  regulation  has  costs  as  well  as  benefits.  Moreover,  most  economists  who 
have looked at proposals for net neutrality appear to agree that the benefits of such 
regulation are likely to fall short of the costs.

Question 1. Are network operators a potential threat to new video services on the 

Internet? 

Answer.  Network  operators  are  indeed  a  potential  threat  to  the  proliferation  of 
new  video  services  on  the  Internet.  The  WGAW  believes  that  the  public  interest  is 
served by the existence of diverse new media platforms that offer original made-for- 
online  content.  Many  such  sites  have  been  launched  and  many  more  are  in  the 
works.  We  must,  however,  ensure  that  these  new  ventures  are  not  placed  at  a  dis-
advantage by network operators that discriminate or in any way impede the ability 
of consumers to access their content. Certain network operators have already admit-
ted  blocking  or  otherwise  interfering  with  certain  types  of  web  traffic.  The  WGAW 
believes the actions of some network operators have set a dangerous precedent and 
must be immediately counteracted. 

Question 2. Should network operators who are also in the business of selling con-
tent to their subscribers have the power to discriminate against competing services? 
Answer. Absolutely not. This type of interference is a threat to the vitality of the 

Internet. 

The concern of the WGAW and its members is that the service providers will use 
their  resources  to  create  a  ‘‘walled  garden’’  on  the  Internet,  effectively  blocking  ac-
cess  to  sites  that  can  not  afford  to  pay  for  distribution,  or  allowing  favored  content 
providers access to a ‘‘fast lane.’’ The Internet is the next frontier in the distribution 
of news and entertainment content. If we want to avoid the problems that have re-
sulted  from  the  extreme  consolidation  of  the  Nation’s  broadcast  system,  we  must 
allow  the  Internet  to  remain  true  to  the  principles  of  openness  that  animated  its 
creation. We must ensure that independent production and a diversity of viewpoints 
are not crowded out of the Internet. SB 215 will do just that. 

We are also concerned that a lack of competition among Internet service providers 
could ultimately leave Americans with fewer choices than what is now available on 
broadcast and cable television. One can imagine a circumstance in which high speed 
Internet  service  to  a  community  is  offered  by  only  one  company.  Should  that  com-
pany also be a content producer, or be affiliated with or have an exclusive arrange-
ment  with  a  content  producer,  the  access  of  consumers  to  diverse  viewpoints  could 
be threatened. We share the Senator’s belief that democracy relies on diverse view-
points. Maintaining the Internet as an open forum will ensure that Americans have 
access to an inexhaustible source of information and entertainment. 

Question  3.  Are  we  in  danger  of  seeing  the  old  media  cartel  reappear  in  new 

Answer.  It  is  not  difficult  to  envision  how  ‘‘old  media’’  conglomerates  could  use 
their  economic  power  to  carve  out  significant  market  share  on  the  Internet,  to  the 
detriment  of  independent  producers  and  small  start-ups.  The  major  media  compa-
nies are actively pursuing online business. Hulu.com and iTunes are two of the most 
prominent examples of the major studios attempting to capture online market share. 
There  is  a  lesson  to  be  learned  from  the  old  media  consolidation.  As  I  mentioned 
in  my  remarks,  the  companies  that  control  distribution,  and  now  production,  have 
used their market power to own and control the content writers create. If we do not 
protect the openness of the Internet, we will merely recreate that increasingly closed 
system,  in  which  distributors  use  their  ability  to  turn  the  spigot  off  and  on  as  a 
means  of  controlling  content.  The  dominant  players  in  the  new  media  cartel  may 
be  the  same  conglomerates  that  control  traditional  media,  or  they  may  be  Internet 
service  providers  that  use  their  distribution  prowess  to  establish  the  same  hier-
archical  business  model.  In  either  case,  such  consolidation  will  be  detrimental  to 
small  producers,  content  creators  and  the  American  public,  which  is  best  served  by 
fostering access to a diversity of views.

Answer.  Over  the  past  few  months  we  have  experienced  an  exponential  growth 
in  the  quality,  quantity,  consumption  and  availability  of  online  content.  Content 
made for traditional media is being reused on the Internet, and new sites have pro-
liferated online with original made-for-Internet material. The members of the Writ-
ers Guild are poised to take advantage of these new platforms as a means of distrib-
uting  the  next  generation  of  audiovisual  content.  But  as  I  said  in  my  testimony,  in 
order  for  writers  to  create  content  and  compete,  we  must  maintain  open  access  to 
the Internet. 

The growth and impact of online content were illustrated during our recent strike 
against  the  major  media  companies.  During  the  work  stoppage,  dozens  of  writers 
began  producing  Internet  content.  These  works  took  many  forms:  historical  anal-
yses,  strike  updates,  parody.  Some  clips  posted  by  WGAW  members  received  as 
many as 500,000 online hits. 

Writers’  interest  in  producing  and  distributing  original  content  on  the  Internet 
will  not  subside  now  that  the  strike  has  ended.  The  Guild  is  actively  negotiating 
collective  bargaining  agreements  with  independent  companies  that  plan  to  con-
centrate on new media production. 

The  WGAW  supports  net  neutrality  as  a  means  of  protecting  the  environment 
that  has  allowed  this  new  market  to  emerge.  Your  question  presupposes  that  ‘net 
neutrality’  is  government  regulation.  We  have  a  different  view.  SB  215  is  not  gov-
ernment regulation, but a prophylactic measure to preserve an open access and pre-
vent the regulation of the Internet by private companies that have the technical ca-
pability to control distribution channels. 

Question 2. How do the revenues received by your members from the Internet dis-

tribution of their works compare to 1 year ago? Five years ago? Ten years ago? 

Answer. While we have seen significant growth in revenues received by members 
from  Internet  distribution.  the  exact  results  have  been  difficult  to  ascertain.  Prior 
to  our  recent  negotiations  with  the  studios,  the  compensation  due  for  material  re-
used  on  the  Internet  was  in  dispute.  With  the  ratification  of  our  new  agreement, 
there is now a negotiated compensation structure for reuse of material on the Inter-
net. Just as important, we succeeded in negotiating broad access rights allowing us 
to monitor the volume of Internet distribution as the market develops. 

Question  3.  Can  you  share  any  example  of  fellow  writers’  work  being  blocked  by 

an Internet provider? 

Answer. While we do not have an example of a fellow writer’s work being blocked, 
the WGAW is extremely concerned about the dangerous precedent being set by cer-
tain  Internet  service  providers.  Comcast,  AOL,  AT&T  and  others  have  all  been  ac-
cused  of,  and  in  some  cases  have  admitted,  network  management  practices  that 
interfered  with  consumer  access  to  legal  content.  The  WGAW  has  learned  from  its 
past  experience  with  media  consolidation  that  we  must  be  diligent  in  our  efforts  to 
ensure  that  these  providers  are  not  allowed  to  restrict  the  ability  of  Americans  to 
access content.

JUSTINE BATEMAN 

Question 1. Are network operators a potential threat to new video services on the 

Internet? 

Answer.  Internet  connection  providers  are  of  course  a  vital  part  of  the  Internet 
experience  and  an  absolute  necessity  in  connecting  to  it.  There  is  certainly  the  im-
pression given by these companies that they would very much like to be in the pri-
mary business of constraining that Internet experience. There simply cannot be the 
continuation of innovation we have witnessed so far on-line with the private interest 
constraints  that  have  been  suggested  by  these  Internet  providers.  The  ‘‘constraint 
business’’ these providers suggest are absolutely threats to new video services. Sup-
ply and demand need to be the deciding factors in a new Internet venture’s success 
or  failure  just  like  in  the  brick-and-mortar  business  landscape.  In  addition,  the 
blocking  and  impeding  of  web  traffic  that  has  been  perpetrated  by  specific  Internet 
providers  establishes  a  dangerous  precedent  and  clearly  demonstrates  the  need  for 
the  Federal  Government  to  require  preserving  the  Internet  as  the  free  and  open 
marketplace it is today. 

Question 2. Should network operators who are also in the business of selling con-
tent to their subscribers have the power to discriminate against competing services? 
Answer.  No.  If  Time/Warner,  for  example,  wants  to  be  in  the  Internet  provider 
business (as they are) they need to abide by those rules (that will hopefully encom-
pass  Net  Neutrality).  If  they  also  want  to  be  in  the  content  provider  business  (as

73 

they  are),  they  are  welcome  to  be  and  to  then  abide  by  those  rules—you  have  to 
be good enough and interesting enough for people to tune in and to continue to tune 
in.  I  do  not  believe  that  wearing  two  hats  means  you  suddenly  disregard  any  rules 
of those hats; it means you now have two sets of rules. 

By  the  way,  is  this  practice  currently  allowed  with  regard  to  the  Cable  TV  serv-
ices  they  provide?  Are  they  allowed  to  block  or  impede  access  to  programming  just 
because it’s not a Time-Warner show or on a Time-Warner network? 

Conversely,  if  each  Internet  customer  had  two  or  more  Internet  providers  to 
choose  from,  then  perhaps  there  would  be  providers  supplying  only  their  material, 
but  the  most  successful  provider  with  the  most  customers  would  always  be  the  one 
offering all the Internet has to offer. 

Question  3.  Are  we  in  danger  of  seeing  the  old  media  cartel  reappear  in  new 

media? 

Answer.  I  absolutely  believe  that  the  media  corporations  are  spitting  mad  that 
they do not have control over the distribution on the Internet and that their current 
and  suggested  future  practices  only  hint  at  the  control  they  wish  they  could  exert 
over it. 

For  the  entire  life  of  TV  and  film  production  until  recently,  the  studios  and  net-
works  have  had  almost  absolute  control  over  distribution.  That  held  not  only  the 
content providers attention, but also that of the advertisers. 

But  at  the  same  time,  al!  the  media  consolidation  of  the  last  15  years  has  taken 
the studios and networks out of the decision positions for the most part and put cor-
porate  businessmen,  far  removed  from  any  knowledge  about  entertainment  produc-
tion,  in  the  decision  seats  instead.  As  a  result,  quality  and  content  have  been  pil-
laged in exchange for cold, hackneyed, overused concepts in our TV shows and films. 
The entire focus of these newly formed Media Collections is to dominate the market 
and increase financial performance. This in itself is not an unproven business tactic, 
but it doesn’t work in the entertainment business. 

So to answer your question, yes, I believe that the media corporations, in an effort 
to  stem  this  mud-slide  of  failure  they  find  themselves  in,  want  to  position  them-
selves  on  the  Internet  in  the  same  dominant  way  as  they’ve  enjoyed  off-line.  The 
fact  of  the  matter  is  that  this  is  not  how  you  regain  success  in  entertainment.  The 
way  you  regain  success  in  entertainment  is  to  create  compelling  programming  that 
people want to see over and over again. 
So, even if they got their wish and ‘‘took over the Internet″, nobody would watch, 
just  like  they’re  not  watching  TV  and  films  like  they  used  to.  And  we  would  all  be 
looking  for  a  new  way  to  share  our  ideas  with  one  another.  Once  that  was  estab-
lished, they would then try to dominate that and so on and so on.

Question.  Under  a  net  neutrality  regulatory  regime,  no  online  data  (including 
video)  could  be  prioritized.  What  impact  would  such  a  regime  have  on  the  success 
of your project, FM78.TV, if you could not guarantee that its content reach end con-
sumers with the quality you and they desire? 

Answer.  The  lack  of  prioritization  for  data,  including  video,  is  exactly  what 
FM78.TV  and  other  online  media  ventures  will  rely  on  in  order  to  be  competitive 
in the new online marketplace. Our biggest worry is that the current set of content 
producers,  mainly  the  major  media  companies,  will  use  their  largesse  to  secure  a 
preferred  place  on  the  Internet.  Should  they  be  able  to  do  that,  companies  such  as 
mine,  which  lack  the  resources  to  pay  for  preferential  service  or  prioritization,  will 
be  unable  to  compete  with  the  extraordinary  resources  of  the  major  media  compa-
nies. If there is a ‘fast lane’ on the internet, I worry that only those companies with 
the financial capacity will be able to spread their content to the public. 

The  Internet  service  providers  have  already  expressed  their  desire  to  maximize 
revenues be creating systems where they can provide preferential services to certain 
content  companies  in  exchange  for  fees  or  compensation.  Such  a  scheme  could  lit-
erally  mean  that  a  company  such  as  mine  is  unable  to  compete.  FM78.TV  would 
prefer  to  maintain  the  open  marketplace  the  current  Internet  structure  provides. 
This  will  allow  small  business  to  compete  with  the  large  corporations  that  want  to 
make  the  Internet  the  latest  iteration  of  broadcast  television—where  control  over 
distribution is used to own and control content. 

If  your  question  is  intended  to  highlight  the  lack  of  broadband  capacity  in  the 
United States, then I share your concern. I too am worried that companies like mine 
can not flourish until more Americans have access to high-speed, high-quality Inter-
net  service.  The  fact  that  we  have  allowed  private  companies  to  build  out  the  cur-

rent broadband network is extremely regrettable and I believe will be a problem for 
generations  to  come.  Unlike  the  airwaves  that  have  been  deemed  public  and  have 
been  monitored  by  the  Federal  Government,  we  have  allowed  the  next  generation 
of  information  to  be  solely  controlled  by  the  companies  that  have  laid  the  ground-
work, with nearly no oversight and with no governance. In such a scenario, the least 
we can do is insure that the companies that control the pipes are not able to inter-
fere with the legal content and information that American’s are able to access. 

I hope the Federal Government, along with state and local governments, will use 
every means at their disposal to facilitate the build of the country’s broadband infra-
structure.  Several  independent  sources  have  expressed  concern  that  the  United 
States is quickly falling behind other developed countries in terms of access to high 
speed  Internet  service.  The  competitiveness  of  our  economic  future  depends  upon 
more Americans having greater access to high speed internet. As a nation, we must 
prioritize  greater  commitment  to  insuring  that  American  continues  to  lead  in  the 
new  economy,  and  insuring  that  every  American  has  access  to  high  speed  Internet 
is critical to that endeavor.’ 

1  find  it  troubling  that  certain  telecommunications  companies  are  claiming  that 
net  neutrality  will  stifle  the  infrastructure  development.  The  same  companies  that 
make  such  a  specious  argument  are  the  same  companies  that  continue  to  generate 
record  profits.  Additionally,  net  neutrality  simply  preserves  the  ability  for  compa-
nies such as mine to distribute content on the net—it does nothing to interfere with 
the companies ability to charge consumers for the services. 

I  sincerely  hope  governments  will  prioritize  the  rapid  development  of  the 
broadband  infrastructure  just  as  I  sincerely  hope  that  the  founding  principle  of  the 
internet—an open marketplace—will be preserved for generations to come. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

KYLE MCSLARROW 

Question  1.  Since  2003,  the  FCC  has  been  reclassifying  broadband  services  as 
Title I services under the Communications Act. In 2005, the Supreme Court upheld 
this  approach  in  its  Brand  X  decision.  In  light  of  the  FCC’s  reclassification  of 
broadband  services  and  the  Supreme  Court  subsequently  deciding  that  this  ap-
proach  passes  legal  muster,  do  you  believe  the  FCC  has  adequate  authority  to  stop 
broadband network providers from engaging in unfair discrimination? 

Answer.  Whether  or  not  the  FCC  has  the  legal  authority  to  regulate  network 
management  practices  and  otherwise  enforce  ‘‘net  neutrality’’  requirements  is  cur-
rently  an  open  question  that  is  being  considered  by  the  FCC  in  an  ongoing  pro-
ceeding.  I  would  also  note  that  the  FCC  is  not  the  only  agency  that  may  have  au-
thority to address these issues. In particular, the FTC has claimed authority to ad-
dress anticompetitive practices by network operators. 

Question 2. Broadband capacity plays an important role in the network neutrality 
and network management discussion. To this end, I would like to ask two questions: 
Can  we  worry  less  about  discrimination  or  content  favoritism  if  there  is  more 

broadband network capacity? 

Answer.  Broadband  consumers  expect  reliable  and  high-quality  service  at  a  rea-
sonable cost that enables them to access lawful content over the Internet—and that 
is  what  cable  broadband  service  provides.  Cable  broadband  subscribers  are  able  to 
enjoy the full benefits of broadband because cable operators manage their smart net-
works on a content-agnostic basis to provide seamless connectivity, deter spam and 
viruses,  and  make  sure  that  a  tiny  minority  of  users  who  utilize  bandwidth-heavy 
applications don’t slow down the Internet for everyone else. 

While  cable  broadband  providers  are  constantly  upgrading  their  capacity,  the  ad-
dition  of  capacity  does  not  obviate  the  need  for  reasonable  network  management 
practices.  For  instance,  as  I  explained  in  my  testimony,  many  P2P  protocols  are 
written specifically to commandeer as much bandwidth as is available, meaning that 
providers  cannot  build  their  way  out  of  the  problems  caused  by  these  high-band-
width  applications.  The  best  way  to  ensure  that  customers  have  the  capability  to 
access applications at desired speeds is to continue to allow broadband providers to 
manage their networks so as to ensure the best results for their customers. 

Question  2a.  Can  broadband  network  providers  add  capacity  fast  enough  to  meet 

consumer demand? 

Answer.  Cable  broadband  providers  are  constantly  upgrading  their  broadband 
networks  to  satisfy  customer  demand  for  fast  and  efficient  access  to  new  content 
and new applications, and to win and retain customers in the face of increased com-
petition  from  many  alternative  providers.  As  I  noted  above,  however,  the  addition

75 

of  capacity  does  not  eliminate  the  need  for  providers  to  manage  their  networks  to 
ensure the best possible broadband experience for their customers. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

KYLE MCSLARROW 

Question 1. In your written testimony you raised concerns that any net neutrality 
rules  may  slow  broadband  roll  out  and  adoption.  Yet,  you  also  cite  the  fact  that 
cable already passes by 92 percent of households. Are you saying, in effect, that net 
neutrality  rules  will  further  slow  consumer  adoption  of  broadband?  I  thought  it  is 
content, applications, and price that drive consumer adoption of broadband. 

Answer.  We  are  very  proud  of  the  fact  that  cable  providers  have  deployed 
broadband to more than 92 percent of households in the United States using private 
risk capital. However, cable broadband providers are constantly upgrading their net-
works  to  meet  consumer  demand  and  to  ensure  a  stable  and  reliable  broadband 
platform  for  providers  of  online  content  and  applications  that  increasingly  need 
greater  transmission  capacity  and  higher  speeds.  Regulations  that  would  dictate  or 
rule  out  particular  business  models  or  impede  a  broadband  provider’s  ability  to 
manage  its  broadband  network  could  deter  investments  in  these  upgrades,  to  the 
detriment of consumers and service providers alike. 

Question 2. Do you believe there to be a competitive market for high-speed Inter-
net access in our country? If so, how many providers do there need to be in a market 
for you to consider that market to be competitive? 

Answer. The market for high-speed Internet access is very competitive. Cable op-
erators, telephone companies, satellite providers, wireless network operators, mobile 
service  providers  and  others  are  investing  and  competing  with  each  other  to  offer 
the most compelling and innovative service. 

Question  3.  Does  your  organization  believe  that  the  FCC’s  four  net  neutrality 

principles are enforceable by the agency? If not, then why not? 

Answer. The FCC’s four net neutrality principles are not binding and enforceable 
today,  because  they  were  not  adopted  as  rules.  Whether  or  not  the  FCC  has  the 
legal  authority  to  adopt  such  rules  or  to  regulate  network  management  practices  is 
currently  an  open  question,  and  is  being  considered  by  the  FCC  in  an  ongoing  pro-
ceeding. 

Question 4. Does your organization believe that the FCC can use its ancillary au-
thority  under  Title  I  of  the  Communications  Act  to  enforce  its  four  net  neutrality 
principles? If not, then why not? 

Answer.  Whether  the  FCC  has  ancillary  authority  to  enforce  its  net  neutrality 

principles is being considered in the proceeding mentioned above. 

Question 5. As you know, in a footnote to the FCC’s four net neutrality principles, 
there  was  an  escape  clause  which  provides  network  operators  a  pass  if  they  can 
show if they are performing ‘‘reasonable network management practices.’’ What does 
NCTA  consider  to  be  ‘‘reasonable  network  management  practices?’’  Does  the  FCC 
need to define the term further? 

Answer. Cable customers enjoy the full benefits of broadband because cable opera-
tors  manage  their  smart  networks  on  a  content-agnostic  basis  to  provide  seamless 
connectivity,  deter  spam  and  viruses,  and  make  sure  that  a  tiny  minority  of  users 
do  not  slow  down  the  Internet  for  everyone  else.  In  order  to  ensure  a  stable  and 
reliable  broadband  platform,  cable  operators  must  have  the  continued  flexibility  to 
adopt and implement content-agnostic network management practices that are rea-
sonable  with  respect  to  their  particular  networks.  ‘‘Reasonable  network  manage-
ment’’ practices also depend on the types of issues that a particular network is fac-
ing. Any government definition of reasonable network management practices would 
invite  confusion  and  litigation  and  would  serve  only  to  inhibit  providers  from  effec-
tively  addressing  future  network  issues.  Regulations  or  a  government  definition  of 
acceptable  network  management  practices  could  also  inhibit  the  development  of  in-
novative  approaches  to  thwarting  piracy  and  enhancing  the  online  experience  for 
the vast majority of Internet users. 

Question  6.  My  understanding  is  that  one  of  the  ideas  the  FCC  is  considering  is 
for  broadband  providers  to  disclose  their  network  management  policies  in  its  terms 
of service. I am not sure what that will accomplish because the idea will only work 
if  there  is  a  competitive  market  for  high-speed  Internet  access,  where  consumers 
can  switch  providers  if  they  do  not  like  the  terms  of  service.  Does  NCTA  support 
greater consumer disclosure of network management practices in plain English and 
in  readable  size  font?  If  a  network  management  practice  is  disclosed  to  consumers, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:29 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 074893 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74893.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

76 

such  as  blocking  or  delaying  packets,  does  it  make  it  OK  for  a  network  operators 
to do it? 

Answer. As I have frequently stated, the cable industry is always looking at ways 
to improve upon its disclosure of information to consumers in order for such disclo-
sure  to  be  as  clear  and  helpful  as  possible.  Cable  operators  believe  that  keeping 
their  subscribers  informed  about  network  management  practices  is  a  critical  ele-
ment of customer service, but best left to individual company’s policies, rather than 
government  rules.  NCTA  member  companies  use  a  variety  of  methods  to  manage 
their networks and are therefore best suited to determine how to appropriately dis-
close  that  information.  Cable  companies  periodically  review  and  revise  their  disclo-
sure  statements  to  ensure  that  they  are  complete  and  easily  understandable,  and 
they  do  so  without  any  government  mandate.  Given  the  intense  competition  for 
broadband  customers  that  cable  faces  from  telephone  companies  and  other  pro-
viders, cable operators strive to ensure that their terms of service are fair and rea-
sonable. 

Question  7.  Bit  Torrent  uses  peer-to-peer  file  sharing  technology  to  deliver  video 
content  online.  My  understanding  is  that  the  technology  is  an  efficient  way  to  de-
liver  content.  Won’t  the  cable  industry’s  transition  to  DOCSIS  3  point  0  and 
Switched Digital Video ease some of the bandwidth constraints? 

Answer.  The  transition  to  DOCSIS  3.0  and  switched  video  technology  will  en-
hance  the  efficiency  of  broadband  networks,  but  it  will  not  eliminate  the  need  for 
sound  network  management  practices.  Network  operators  will  still  need  to  address 
and eliminate viruses and spam, and they will still need to ensure that tiny minor-
ity of heavy users does not degrade service for the vast majority of customers. Fur-
ther,  as  I  explained  in  my  testimony,  many  P2P  protocols  are  written  specifically 
to  commandeer  as  much  bandwidth  as  is  available,  meaning  that  added  capacity 
can’t eliminate problems caused by these high-bandwidth applications. The best way 
to ensure that customers have the capability to access applications at desired speeds 
is  to  continue  to  allow  broadband  providers  to  manage  their  networks  so  as  to  en-
sure the best results for their customers. 

Question 8. Some public interest groups argue that the reason a cable system op-
erator  might  want  to  degrade  the  lawful  peer-to-peer  video  delivered  online  is  for 
competitive reasons. How do you respond? 

Answer.  Those  charges  are  wholly  without  foundation.  In  just  the  last  few  years, 
the  use  of  Internet  video  on  demand  has  grown  at  a  dramatic  rate.  In  July  2006, 
107 million Americans watched video online and about 60 percent of Internet users 
downloaded  more  than  7  billion  videos  off  the  Internet.  In  February  2008,  nearly 
135 million U.S. Internet users spent an average of 204 minutes viewing 10.1 billion 
online  videos.  YouTube  represented  34  percent  of  those  online  videos,  or  nearly  3.5 
billion  in  total.  To  put  it  into  context,  in  2006,  YouTube  consumed  as  much  band-
width as the entire Internet consumed in the year 2000. 

Competition  has  driven  cable  operators  to  invest  in  faster  and  more  reliable  net-
works  to  meet  consumer  demand  for  video  and  other  bandwidth-intensive  applica-
tions.  Cable’s  investment  in  and  deployment  of  the  reliable  high-speed  broadband 
service  that  provides  the  ecosystem  in  which  Google,  YouTube,  Yahoo!  and  other 
Internet services can flourish. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. TED STEVENS TO 

KYLE MCSLARROW 

Question 1. What do consumers expect a network operator to provide for them in 

terms of service and network management? 

Answer.  Broadband  consumers  expect  reliable  and  high-quality  service  at  a  rea-
sonable cost that enables them to access lawful content over the Internet. Cable op-
erators  have  demonstrated  their  commitment  to  providing  Americans  the  very  best 
broadband  service  available,  and  remain  committed  to  doing  so.  Cable  broadband 
subscribers  enjoy  the  full  benefits  of  broadband  because  cable  operators  manage 
their  smart  networks  on  a  content-agnostic  basis  to  provide  seamless  connectivity, 
deter  spam  and  viruses,  and  make  sure  that  a  tiny  minority  of  users  who  utilize 
bandwidth-heavy applications don’t slow down the Internet for everyone else. 

Question 2. If a particular bandwidth service or application uses more bandwidth 
than  others,  why  shouldn’t  the  business  owner  of  that  application  or  service  have 
to pay a fee? 

Answer.  It  may  very  well  be  appropriate  for  a  provider  of  such  a  service  to  bear 
a  portion  of  the  costs  of  delivering  the  service  to  its  users.  The  alternative  would 
be for the network provider to pass those costs on to all subscribers, including those

who  do  not  user  the  service.  This  could  put  unnecessary  upward  pressure  on  the 
rates  for  broadband  service  and  impede  broadband  adoption.  Network  and  service 
providers  need  the  flexibility  to  design  and  implement  business  plans  that  allow 
them to innovate and respond to consumer demand. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE TO 

KYLE MCSLARROW 

Question 1. In a news.com August 2007 article, a Comcast spokesman ‘‘flat-out de-
nied’’  Comcast  was  filtering  or  ‘‘shaping’’  any  traffic  on  its  network.  He  went  on  to 
state  the  company  doesn’t  actively  look  at  the  applications  or  content  that  its  cus-
tomers  download  over  the  network.  Obviously,  the  Comcast-BitTorrent  incident 
seems to conflict with that assertion. In another incident last year, Comcast discon-
nected  several  high-usage  broadband  customers.  Comcast  did  contact  them  prior  to 
discontinuing  their  services  warning  to  curb  excessive  bandwidth  consumption  or 
risk  a  one-year  service  termination  but  didn’t  clearly  reveal  how  much  bandwidth 
consumption  is  allowed.  Why  didn’t  Comcast  provide  more  appropriate  disclosure 
with these two incidents? 

Answer.  As  this  question  is  most  properly  directed  to  Comcast,  we  have  shared 

the question with the company and it has provided the following response: 

Comcast  works  hard  to  ensure  that  its  customers  have  appropriate  disclosure 
about its need to manage its network in order to prevent certain uses of the net-
work from degrading the experience of other customers. Comcast’s network man-
agement  activities,  both  with  respect  to  BitTorrent  and  with  respect  to  excessive 
users,  are  consistent  with  the  disclosures  its  customers  receive  in  the  Terms  of 
Service  (‘‘TOS’’)  and  Acceptable  Use  Policy  (‘‘AUP’’)  they  are  obligated  to  review 
before  they  may  use  the  service.  For  years,  Comcast’s  TOS  has  specified  that 
Comcast  High-Speed  Internet  service  is  subject  to  ‘‘speed  and  upstream  and 
downstream  rate  limitations,’’  and  that  the  service  may  be  used  only  for  ‘‘per-
sonal,  residential,  non-commercial  purposes.’’  Similarly,  for  years  Comcast’s 
AUP has prohibited the use of the service that ‘‘restrict[sl, inhibit[s], or otherwise 
interfere[s] with the ability of any other person . . . to use or enjoy the [s]ervice, 
including  . . .  generating  levels  of  traffic  sufficient  to  impede  others’  ability  to 
send  or  retrieve  information.’’  And,  for  years,  Comcast’s  AUP  has  required  cus-
tomers to ensure that their ‘‘use of the Service does not restrict, inhibit, interfere 
with, or degrade any other user’s use of the Service nor represent . . . an overly 
large burden on the network’’ Comcast has openly and readily acknowledged that 
it  manages  its  network,  including  managing  traffic  that  causes  congestion  as 
well  as  reserving  the  right  to  terminate  service  of  those  customers  who  abuse 
their service after due notice. 
‘‘Transparency’’  on  network  management  issues  is  incredibly  complicated  given 
that Internet applications and services change constantly. Nevertheless, Comcast 
works to ensure that its disclosures on matters such as network management and 
excessive  usage  are  timely  and  in  sufficient  detail  to  ensure  transparency  to  our 
customers while not providing a roadmap to those who would seek to defeat these 
reasonable  network  management  efforts.  Mindful  of  the  views  of  its  customers— 
and  of  policymakers—who  have  urged  that  the  challenges  of  network  manage-
ment  and  excessive  usage  he  explained  better  to  consumers,  Comcast  revised  its 
AUP  and  FAQs  earlier  this  year  to  provide  even  greater  transparency  on  these 
subjects. We provide more details in our response to the next question. 
Ultimately,  Comcast’s  network  management  practices  are  undertaken  to  ensure 
that its customers continue to receive the world-class service that they have come 
to expect from Comcast. 

Question  2.  Comcast  has  also  recently  changed  its  Terms  of  Service  in  January 
where  it  now  states  the  company  ‘‘uses  reasonable  network  management  practices 
that  are  consistent  with  industry  standards’’  and  it  temporarily  delays  peer-to-peer 
sessions  during  ‘‘periods  of  high  network  congestion’’  which  seem  vague.  Could  you 
elaborate on what the ‘‘industry standards’’ are because it seems as if the techniques 
Comcast  employed  with  BitTorrent  were  non-standards  based  practices—such  as 
spoofing  or  falsifying  IP  packets  and  infringing  on  consumer  privacy  by  inspecting 
consumers’ data to determine which were from the P2P application? 

Answer.  As  this  question  is  most  properly  directed  to  Comcast,  we  have  shared 

the question with the company and it has provided the following response: 

To  effectuate  its  current  bandwidth  management,  Comcast  ‘s  network  issues  in-
structions called ‘‘reset packets’’—which involve a communication between two IP 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:29 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 074893 PO 00000 Frm 00081 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74893.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

78 

the 

two 

the 

communications  between 

addresses  (and,  importantly,  not  between  two  people)—to  temporarily  delay  the 
initiation of new P2P file uploads at times of network congestion. 
A  ‘‘reset’’  is  nothing  more  than  a  bit  in  the  TCP  packet  header  that  is  used  to 
signal that there is an error condition within the network and that a new connec-
tion  needs  to  be  established;  the  new  connection  is  automatically  established  by 
the application or service initiating the connection. The use of resets is common-
place.  AT&T  has  noted  that  ‘‘[t]he  ‘reset’  command  has  been  [around]  for  more 
than a quarter century’’ and ‘‘is commonly used to enable one computer to abort 
a  TCP  connection  with  another  computer  for  any  of  a  number  of  reasons,  such 
as  when 
computers  become 
unsynchronized.’’  And  Richard  Bennett,  a  noted  network  engineer,  recently  de-
scribed a reset packet as ‘‘the only machine language [P2P protocols] understand 
[and] this type of technique is common in the networking and software industry 
where alternatives don’t exist.’’ It is the same message that the computer receives 
when  any  number  of  problems  occur  during  a  P2P  file  transfer,  and  the  com-
puter  requesting  the  file  automatically  knows  how  to  process  this  message  and 
to  retry  its  request  (assuming  it  has  not  already  downloaded  the  file  from  other 
computers) without the user having to take any additional action, just like a fax 
machine  does  when  it  receives  a  busy  signal.  To  most  end  users,  these  commu-
nications  will  be  virtually  imperceptible,  and,  especially  in  the  case  of  properly 
functioning P2P protocols, will have no perceptible effect on the end user’s experi-
ence. 
Comcast does not inspect the content of data packets traversing its network, and 
does  not  treat  data  packets  differently  based  on  their  content.  Rather,  Comcast, 
like  many  other  ISPs,  inspects  the  data  packets  only  to  the  extent  necessary  to 
determine whether the packet will cause damage to the network or otherwise de-
grade  the  consumer  experience.  Inspecting  data  packets  to  determine  whether 
they are sent by a particular P2P protocol that causes excessive congestion is no 
different than inspecting the packets to determine whether they contain malicious 
code,  such  as  viruses,  worms,  spam,  or  other  firms  of  malware.  Other  network 
functions,  including,  in  some  cases,  proper  routing  of  the  packets,  also  require 
this kind of packet inspection. In all cases, such inspection is reasonably limited 
to look no further than necessary than to determine whether the transmission is 
using a P2P protocol that causes excessive congestion that can degrade other cus-
tomers’ Internet experiences. There are no privacy implications in such packet in-
spections. 
Finally,  we  are  engaging  with  the  broad  Internet  community  through  the  Inter-
net Engineering Task Force (IETF) to review how and why we implemented our 
current  bandwidth  management  practices,  and  to  consult  with  them  on  alter-
native  approaches,  including  efforts  to  make  P2P  technologies  more  bandwidth- 
efficient. 

Question  3.  Don’t  certain  networking  protocols  and  standards,  such  as  Trans-
mission  Control  Protocol  (TCP),  already  employ  congestion  control  mechanisms,  so 
why add an additional layer? 

Answer.  Different  network  operators  have  different  reasons  for  employing  their 
particular set of network management techniques and strategies. The merits, feasi-
bility, and effectiveness of using particular congestion management techniques such 
as traditional TCP congestion controls versus using more innovative approaches are 
very complex technical issues that many of the greatest minds in the Internet com-
munity  are  currently  debating.  NCTA’s  member  companies  work  hard  to  ensure 
that their customers receive a world-class service, and need the flexibility to use the 
network  management  practices  that  best  address  their  particular  circumstances  to 
continue to deliver the type of service that their users expect and deserve. 

Question  4.  MIT  Scientist  David  Clark  recently  voiced  frustration  about  the  lack 
of  availability  of  data  and  information  on  network  usage  from  the  Internet  service 
providers  in  order  to  conduct  studies  on  some  of  the  network  problems  that  exist. 
Mr.  Clark  gave  one  example  where  he  could  not  get  one  domestic  ISP  to  provide 
any  useful  information  for  his  study  on  residential  high-usage  broadband  users— 
this  in  light  of  offering  to  keep  the  ISP’s  data  completely  anonymous.  There  also 
seemed  to  be  similar  reluctance  from  industry  with  crafting  national  broadband 
mapping  policy—to  improve  the  accuracy  of  the  data  so  consumers  and  businesses 
know  where  broadband  is  offered  and  ISPs  know  where  demand  is.  Why  this  con-
stant reluctance, even when the data would remain anonymous? 

Answer.  We  know  and  respect  Dr.  Clark’s  work.  Various  of  our  companies  have 
spoken with Dr. Clark and others in the academic community about the challenges 
of sharing such data, and we are hopeful that this can be worked out with all ISPs. 
For  ISPs,  understanding  customer  usage  patterns  is  an  important  part  of  devising

solutions  for  network  management.  Of  course,  network  usage  data  is  confidential 
and  competitively  sensitive,  and  there  may  be  privacy  issues  raised  by  allowing 
third parties to have access to such data. Moreover, any network management solu-
tion needs to be designed to function with the specific technology each provider has 
implemented in its network. 

We respectfully disagree with the suggestion that the cable industry has been re-
luctant  to  craft  a  national  broadband  mapping  policy.  The  cable  industry  has  con-
sistently  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  policies  that  ensure  all  Americans  have 
access  to  affordable  broadband.  Cable  supports  Senator  Inouye’s  Broadband  Data 
Improvement Act because we believe that improving Federal data collection and dis-
semination  regarding  where  broadband  services  have  been  deployed  in  the  United 
States is necessary in order to achieve the goal of ubiquitous broadband availability 
for  all  Americans.  And  cable  companies  have  cooperated  with  programs  under  the 
aegis of Connected Nation on state broadband mapping efforts. 

Question  5.  If  we  don’t  have  this  information  then  how  can  we  properly  address 
the  problems  we’re  facing,  whether  from  standards  development,  regulatory,  or  a 
policy perspective? 

Answer.  As  noted  above,  cable  fully  supports  broadband  mapping  legislation,  but 
we  believe  that  network  usage  data  is  better  evaluated  by  individual  network  pro-
viders. 

Question  6.  You’ve  stated  ‘‘various  estimates  are  that  as  few  as  5  percent  of  cus-
tomers  use  from  50  to  90  percent  of  the  total  capacity  of  the  network.’’  But  where 
is the industry data to support this claim? 

Answer. The following from the FCC record: 
AT&T Comments, WC Docket No. 07–52, at 14–15 (quoting David Vorhaus, Yan-

kee Group, Confronting the Albatross of P2P 1–2 (May 31, 2007)): 

• P2P traffic ‘‘constitutes approximately 60 percent of all traffic that traverses the 

public internet’’; 

• ‘‘BitTorrent alone accounts for roughly 40 percent of all bandwidth’’; 
• ‘‘[i]n times of peak usage, bandwidth-hogging users sharing large files over P2P 

can push networks to their absolute limit’’; and 

• ‘‘[t]his  problem  is  poised  to  worsen  in  the  coming  years’’  because,  ‘‘[a]s  content 
owners  migrate  more  video  content  to  IP  networks,  bandwidth  demand  will  in-
evitably skyrocket.’’ 

‘‘In  the  absence  of  the  broadband  management  practices,  as  few  as  5  percent  of 
users  dictate  the  terms  on  which  the  remaining  95  percent  of  users  get  access  to 
broadband.’’ CTIA Reply Comments, WC Docket No. 07–52, at 3 (citing CTIA Com-

‘‘In a recent study of average data usage on its high speed wireless EvDO mobile 
broadband network, Sprint Nextel learned that a subset of end users, approximately 
3  percent,  accounted  for  more  than  50  percent  of  the  total  data  usage  on  the  net-
work.  During  busy  hours,  a  mere  1  percent  of  end  users  generates  42  percent  of 
data  traffic  and  is  affecting  performance  for  all  other  users.  While  the  demands  of 
these  users  may  not  have  a  significant  impact  at  3  a.m.,  they  do  affect  the  other 
99  percent  of  end  users  during  the  peak  busy  hours  of  8  p.m.  and  midnight.  If 
Sprint Nextel took no action to manage its network two or 3 percent of its total end

percent.’’ Sprint Reply Comments, WC Docket No. 07–52, at 6. 

NBC Universal Reply Comments, WC Docket No. 07–52: 
• Five percent of Internet users consume at least 60 to 70 percent of network ca-

• A Sandvine report had similar conclusions. In Europe upstream P2P traffic rep-
resents up to 85 percent of all bandwidth consumed on broadband provider net-
works.  Downstream  P2P  traffic  represents  about  60  percent  of  bandwidth  con-
sumed. In the U.S. and U.K. upstream traffic amounts to 76 percent and down-
stream 48 percent. (5) 
• Time  Warner  Cable  announced  that  fewer  than  5  percent  of  its  users  account 
for  60–70  percent  of  their  network  capacity—all  through  P2P  applications. 
Other  commentators  have  noted  that  this  can  reach  as  high  as  90–95  percent 
during peak times. (5–6) 

‘‘As the record makes clear, P2P traffic constitutes a clear majority of all Internet

‘‘A  study  of  Internet  traffic  between  August  and  September  2007  confirmed  that

‘‘Numerous  groups  have  highlighted  the  significant—negative—impact  of  P2P  on 
America’s  broadband  infrastructure.  Estimates  are  that  as  much  as  90  percent  of

Other analyses have shown that as few as 15 users within a geographic area using 
P2P  can  demonstrably  degrade  the  Internet  experience  for  the  rest  of  the  commu-
nity.  The  Yankee  Group  estimates  that  P2P  ‘can  push  networks  to  their  absolute 
limit’  during  times  of  peak  usage.  According  to  the  network  engineer  Richard  Ben-
nett,  ‘[t]he  fundamental  design  goal  of  BitTorrent  is  to  use  up  all  available  band-
width.’  Others  contend  that  P2P  ‘will  sop  up  the  majority  of  available  bandwidth.’ ’’

George Ou 4/14/08 Written Testimony Generally 
Question  7.  Can  you  provide  the  raw  data  to  support  this  or  elaborate  on  the 

sources of the estimates you cite? 

Answer. See above. 
Question  8.  Comcast  has  made  the  assertion  that  the  FCC  has  no  legal  power  to 
stop  them  from  engaging  in  what  it  calls  ‘‘reasonable  network  management’’  even 
if  Comcast’s  behavior  was  deemed  inconsistent  with  the  Internet  Policy  Statement. 
Further  more,  Comcast  states  that  given  cable  modem  service  is  an  information 
service  not  a  telecommunications  service,  that  any  attempt  to  justify  an  injunction 
on Comcast based on a statutory provision that is explicitly limited to common car-
riers would violate the Communications Act and be arbitrary and capricious. If this 
is  true,  how  can  the  FCC  effectively  prevent  or  enforce,  in  a  swift  manner,  unrea-
sonable  or  discriminatory  practices  related  to  broadband  or  network  management? 
Answer.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  FCC’s  Internet  Policy  Statement  is  not  bind-
ing and enforceable today. Indeed, the Chairman of the FCC acknowledged that fact 
explicitly when the FCC issued it, expressly stating that the FCC was not adopting 
enforceable rules. Whether or not the FCC has the legal authority to adopt enforce-
able  rules  that  regulate  network  management  practices  is  currently  an  open  ques-
tion, and is being considered by the FCC in an ongoing proceeding. I would also note 
that the FTC has also claimed authority to address anticompetitive practices by net-
work operators. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JIM DEMINT TO 

KYLE MCSLARROW 

Question 1. Many people today have cited a time when ‘‘net neutrality’’ principles 
were enforced through common carrier regulations. Have cable modem services ever 
been treated under common carrier regulations? 

Answer. No. There was a short period in which the underlying transmission com-
ponent  of  cable  modem  service  was  considered  a  common  carrier  offering,  but  only 
in  the  9th  Circuit,  as  a  result  of  that  court’s  ruling  in  AT&T  v.  City  of  Portland, 
216 F.3d 871 (2000). Notably, even this ruling did not apply common carrier regula-

tion to cable modem service itself. Less than 2 years after City of Portland, the FCC 
issued a declaratory ruling holding that neither cable modem service nor the under-
lying  broadband  transport  was  subject  to  common  carrier  regulation.  In  NCTA  v. 
Brand X Internet Services, 545 U.S. 967 (2005), the Supreme Court not only upheld 
the FCC’s ruling, but also held that the ruling superseded the 9th Circuit’s decision. 
Question 2. We hear a great deal about a lack of availability of broadband service 
in  the  United  States,  but  your  testimony  indicates  that  cable  broadband  service  is 
now  available  to  92  percent  of  Americans.  How  many  years  has  it  taken  to  reach 
this level? 

Answer. Cable operators have invested $130 billion since 1996 to build fiber optic 
networks  that  have  brought  high-speed  Internet  access  to  more  than  92  percent  of 
the United States. 

Question 3. How much public subsidy has been used to reach this level? 
Answer.  Other  than  a  small  amount  of  funding  through  the  E-Rate  program  to 
wire  schools  and  libraries,  cable  operators  have  relied  on  private  risk  capital  to  de-
ploy their networks. 

Question  4.  How  do  you  feel  the  efforts  of  the  cable  industry  comport  with  Mr. 

Lessig’s model of abundance? 

Answer. Contrary to Mr. Lessig’s suggestion, cable operators in fact have adopted 
a ‘‘business model of abundance and neutrality,’’ in which providers offer ‘‘whatever 
legal  applications  and  content  users  and  innovators  want.’’  If  cable  operators  pur-
sued the model of ‘‘scarcity and control’’ he claims we do, they would soon lose cus-
tomers  to  other  providers  of  broadband  service.  It  is  clearly  unnecessary  to  enact 
legislation imposing any particular business model, and doing so would deprive net-
work  operators  of  the  flexibility  they  need  to  innovate  and  respond  to  customer  de-
mand. 

Question 5. Many people belittle the competition that exists between cable compa-
nies  and  telephone  companies  in  the  broadband  market  today,  as  well  as  the  com-
petition  provided  by  wireless  and  satellite  providers.  Could  you  provide  your  view 
on  the  state  of  competition,  and  what  impact  that  competition  has  on  consumers? 
Answer.  Broadband  services  arc  intensely  competitive,  with  cable  operators,  tele-
phone companies, satellite providers, wireless network operators, mobile service pro-
viders and others investing, innovating and competing with one another. In this en-
vironment,  cable  operators  are  striving  to  give  consumers  the  best  Internet  experi-
ence they can, at the best value. 

Question  6.  You’ve  stated  ‘‘various  estimates  are  that  as  few  as  5  percent  of  cus-
tomers  use  from  50  to  90  percent  of  the  total  capacity  of  the  network.’’  But  where 
is the industry data to support this claim? 

Answer.  There  are  no  hard  and  fast  rules  with  regard  to  estimates  of  bandwidth 
consumption,  thus  the  reasoning  behind  referencing  a  range  in  the  testimony.  One 
reason  for  the  wide  range  of  estimates  reported  may  be  the  difficulty  in  detecting 
certain  types  of  protocols  of  Internet  traffic.  Some  P2P  clients  now  incorporate  pro-
tocol  obfuscation  using  encryption  and  similar  methods  to  hide  from  detection. 
Therefore  some  of  the  studies  or  estimates  may  not  actually  be  detecting  all  of  the 
P2P  and  other  bandwidth  intensive  activities  that  are  actively  taking  measures  to 
fly under the radar. 

The  core  of  the  bandwidth  consumption  statement  came  from  an  Ellacoya  Net-
works  study.1 It  should  be  noted  that  this  finding  was  not  exclusively  addressing 
P2P,  but  it  did  cite  P2P  as  the  primary  high-bandwidth  application.  The  testimony 
also  cited  recent  experience  in  Japan,  where  1  percent  of  broadband  users,  using 
P2P,  account  for  roughly  47  percent  of  total  consumption,  and  10  percent  of  users, 
using  P2P,  account  for  75  percent  of  total  consumption.2 Many  other  studies  and 
knowledgeable  entities  have  disclosed  findings  about  inordinate  bandwidth  con-
sumption, often as a result of P2P usage. Included among these are: 

1 No  free  lunches  on  the  Net;  Research  conducted  by  Ellacoya  Networks  shows  that  up  to  5 
percent  of  broadband  subscribers  can  consume  nearly  90  percent  of  network  bandwidth,  pri-
marily by using high-bandwidth applications such as streaming media and, especially, file shar-
ing.  These  demands  are  more  than  doubling  network  capacity  requirements  each  year.  http://

‘‘In a recent study of average data usage on its high speed wireless EvDO mobile

allow network operators to combat this. (1–2) 
• Commission Deborah Taylor Tate referenced piracy in her opening statement on

growing. (5) 
• A Sandvine report had similar conclusions. In Europe upstream P2P traffic rep-
resents up to 85 percent of all bandwidth consumed on broadband provider net-
works.  Downstream  P2P  traffic  represents  about  60  percent  of  bandwidth  con-
sumed. In the U.S. and U.K. upstream traffic amounts to 76 percent and down-
stream 48 percent. (5)

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

PROFESSOR LAWRENCE LESSIG 

Question  1.  Since  2003,  the  FCC  has  been  reclassifying  broadband  services  as 
Title I services under the Communications Act. In 2005, the Supreme Court upheld 
this  approach  in  its  Brand  X  decision.  In  light  of  the  FCC’s  reclassification  of 
broadband  services  and  the  Supreme  Court  subsequently  deciding  that  this  ap-
proach  passes  legal  muster,  do  you  believe  the  FCC  has  adequate  authority  to  stop 
broadband network providers from engaging in unfair discrimination? 

Answer.  I  do  believe  that  Brand  X  means  the  FCC  has  the  authority  to  stop 
broadband  network  providers  from  engaging  in  unfair  and  innovation-harming  dis-
crimination. But I believe that network providers will challenge that authority, un-
necessarily  delaying  the  FCC’s  efforts  to  protect  against  discrimination.  I  therefore 
think clarifying legislation by Congress would be helpful. 

Question 2. Broadband capacity plays an important role in the network neutrality 
and network management discussion. To this end, I would like to ask two questions: 
Can  we  worry  less  about  discrimination  or  content  favoritism  if  there  is  more 
broadband network capacity? 

Answer.  Yes,  we  can  worry  less,  at  least  about  discrimination  or  favoritism.  The 

FCC must continue to be concerned about blocking certain applications. 

Question  2a.  Can  broadband  network  providers  add  capacity  fast  enough  to  meet 

consumer demand? 

Answer.  There  is  no  technical  reason  providers  can’t  add  capacity  to  meet  con-
sumer demand. My concern is that providers are withholding capacity until they are 
confident  of  a  regulatory  environment  in  which  they  can  discriminate  in  ways  that 
will ultimately harm innovation. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BYRON L. DORGAN TO 

PROFESSOR LAWRENCE LESSIG 

Question  1.  Are  we  in  danger  of  seeing  the  old  media  cartel  reappear  in  new 

media? 

Answer.  Yes.  The  pattern  of  new  media  captured  by  old  is  as  old  as  media,  and 
the pattern of that recapture is well settled. Current practices by network providers 
match that pattern, and without sufficient resistance by the FCC, the incentive will 
certainly be to reestablish that ‘‘cartel.’’ 

Question 2. Does current law or agency authority provide adequate protections to 
prevent the Internet from becoming a closed network similar to cable television, in-
stead as opposed to the open platform the Internet was developed to be? 

Answer.  Authority  alone  won’t  prevent  anything.  Unless  the  FCC  takes  a  clear 
policy  stand,  expressed  in  enforceable  regulations,  ideally  backed  up  by  a  clear  de-
mand  by  Congress,  network  providers  will  continue  to  angel  for  a  network  over 
which  they  exercise  a  power  to  discriminate  that  can’t  help  but  weaken  innovation 
in applications and content. 

Question 3. Is the current regulatory structure sufficient to meet the needs of the 

Answer.  The  FCC  has  the  means,  if  it  has  the  will.  But  I  believe  it  is  a  mistake 
to  trust  the  future  of  the  Internet  to  the  policy  preferences  of  unelected  FCC  com-
missioners.  It  is  Congress’s  job  to  set  the  policy  of  the  FCC,  and  Congress  has  not 
adequately  charged  the  FCC  with  the  requirement  that  it  assure  network  neu-
trality. 

Internet? 

Question  4.  Representatives  of  the  phone  and  cable  companies  have  consistently 
argued that if Congress were to impose a nondiscrimination rule, network operators 
would  not  deploy  broadband  networks.  Isn’t  this  a  false  choice?  Why  can’t  we  have 
an open Internet and world class deployment? 

Answer.  Network  providers  in  every  major  industrialized  nation  comparable  to 
the  United  States  face  more  restrictive  regulatory  obligations  than  are  being  dis-
cussed  in  network  neutrality  regulations,  yet  providers  in  those  countries  have  de-
ployed  better—faster,  cheaper—broadband  networks.  This  does  suggest  these  rep-
resentatives  have  presented  a  false  choice—unless  there  is  some  reason  to  believe 
American  network  providers  are  less  capable  than,  for  example,  French  network 
providers. 

Question  5.  Recently,  Comcast  announced  that  it  is  engaging  in  conversations 
with  Bit  Torrent,  Inc.  and  Pando  Networks,  which  distribute  content  through  Bit 
Torrent applications. Does this demonstrate that the marketplace is addressing the 
concerns raised by consumers?

85 

Answer.  Not  in  a  way  that  would  in  any  sense  address  the  competitive  and  inno-
vation  concerns  raised  by  Comcast’s  behavior.  If  innovators  have  to  strike  a  deal 
with network providers be-fore their innovation can be released on the network, in-
novation on the Internet would be radically constrained. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

PROFESSOR LAWRENCE LESSIG 

Question  1.  The  last  time  you  testified  before  the  Committee,  you  expressed  con-
cerns  about  the  potential  ‘cablelization’  of  the  Internet.  Two  years  later  do  you  see 
signs that it is occurring? 

Answer.  Absolutely.  By  ‘‘cablelization,’’  I  meant  the  move  to  an  Internet  where 
providers:  (1)  face  no  legal  obligation  of  neutrality  or  access,  and  (2)  operate  under 
a norm that expresses the idea that the network owner has an absolute right to con-
trol  the  content  (or  applications)  on  ‘‘their’’  network.  Both  aspects  of  that  definition 
have only been reinforced in the past 2 years. 

Question  2.  In  your  testimony,  you  cite  the  electricity  grid  as  a  fundamentally 
neutral  network.  As  you  know,  there  are  a  handful  of  trials  being  conducted  over-
seas where broadband providers are charging consumers on a per-packet basis simi-
lar to how utilities price electricity on a per-kilowatt hour basis. Do you believe such 
an Internet business model is viable? Would charging on a per-packet basis provide 
a  financial  disincentive  for  the  small  group  of  heavy  bandwidth  users  that  some 
broadband providers are concerned about? 

Answer. I certainly do believe that business model is viable, and that it would not 
violate  the  appropriate  norms  of  network  neutrality,  even  while  I  very  much  hope 
that  it  does  not  become  the  dominant  model  for  providing  access  to  the  Internet. 
My concern is that by failing to impose ‘‘open access’’ obligations on broadband pro-
viders,  both  cable  and  telecom,  we  don’t  have  sufficient  ISP  competition  to  guar-
antee that alternatives to this per-packet model will have a chance to flourish. 

Question 3. I have heard you argue that ‘‘fast lanes’’ on the Internet are only valu-
able  if  ‘‘slow  lanes’’  are  really  slow.  This  approach  can  create  a  perverse  incentive 
among network providers not to build the fastest network possible and an incentive 
to  maintain  bottlenecks.  In  light  of  the  response  Verizon  has  received  from  Wall 
Street for its FIOS rollout, do you believe that broadband providers have the incen-
tive to upgrade their networks? 

Answer.  It  is  clear  Wall  Street  will  reward  investment  decisions  that  maximize 
the short term return to broadband providers—whether or not those decisions maxi-
mize  long  term  broad-band  growth  for  the  Nation.  For  that  reason,  I  think  it  is  a 
fundamental  mistake  for  Congress  to  look  to  Wall  Street’s  ratings  as  a  guide  for 
good  public  policy.  The  innovators  who  would  lose  from  a  non-neutral  network  (the 
next  Google’s,  or  Facebooks),  don’t  yet  have  Wall  Street  analysts  focusing  on  them. 
Congress should insist on a broadband policy that benefits long term innovation and 
growth,  and  once  that  policy  is  set,  adjust  incentives  in  providers  are  not  building 
networks sufficiently quickly. 

Question  4.  Dr.  Hahn  argues  in  his  testimony  that  experimentation  with  new 
business models is the key to Internet innovation at both the ‘‘core’’ and the ‘‘edge’’ 
of  the  network,  and  the  deployment  of  more  intelligent  networks  needed  to  handle 
rapidly growing Internet traffic. In your opinion, would net neutrality rules prevent 
innovation at the core of the network or prevent the deployment of more intelligent 
networks? 

Answer. I was confused by Dr. Hahn’s testimony, as he was using the term ‘‘core’’ 
and ‘‘edge’’ in a way that is inconsistent with the standard terminology among net-
work  theorists  and  economists.  As  these  terms  are  ordinarily  used:  It  is  clear  that 
network  neutrality  regulations  would  have  absolutely  no  effect  on  innovation  in 
‘‘edge’’  technologies.  The  only  ‘‘core’’  technologies  network  neutrality  legislation 
would  affect  would  be  those  that  harmed  network  neutrality.  Thus,  for  example, 
some  quality  of  service  techniques  would  be  inconsistent  with  network  neutrality 
principles, but all would not. 

Question 5. If U.S. network operators do end up charging content providers a sec-
ond  fee  for  delivering  a  differentiated  quality  of  service  to  their  customers,  I  am 
deeply  concerned  that  net-work  operators  in  other  nations  will  follow  suit.  Given 
that,  in  many  nations,  the  government  owns  a  percentage,  if  not  all,  of  the  single, 
largest  network  provider,  American  companies  exporting  on-line  content  and  serv-
ices will find themselves paying an additional tax, and thus be placed at a competi-
tive disadvantage with preferred content and service local champions. Do you know 
how other nations view net neutrality?

86 

Answer. Most other nations have not had to confront network neutrality concerns 
because  they  have  imposed  a  more  onerous  set  of  regulatory  obligations,  similar  to 
the ‘‘open access’’ regulations that the FCC imposed on telecom providers in the late 
1990s.  Because  those  regulations  tend  to  create  significant  ISP  competition,  the 
need to police neutrality on the network has proven to be less. If these other nations 
remove ‘‘open access’’ requirements, however, I would be concerned about the effect 
on American providers for precisely the reasons outlined. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR TO 

PROFESSOR LAWRENCE LESSIG 

Question  1.  You  said  in  your  prepared  remarks  that  today’s  venture  capitalists 
need certainty about the future of the internet. That is, they need to now today how 
the  Internet  will  be  managed  tomorrow.  Without  that  certainty,  you  claim  these 
venture  capitalists  will  be  less  likely  to  invest  in  new  Internet  technologies.  What 
will give these venture capitalists certainty? 

Answer.  The  only  thing  that  would  provide  this  certainty  is  if  the  policymaker 
charged  with  setting  Internet  and  communications  policy  generally  set  this  policy 
as  a  fundamental  principle  for  communication  regulators.  In  my  view,  it  is  Con-
gress, and not the FCC, that is charged with setting that policy. 

Question 2. Can you provide an example, or examples, of innovators holding back 
on  inventions  and/or  advancements  in  Internet  technology  because  of  uncertainty 
surrounding the future of network neutrality? 

Answer. As these are innovators whose ideas die on the venture capitalist’s board-
room table, they are not public or common knowledge. My own research in this area 
has been informed by these venture capitalists, and their own account of the factors 
they use to evaluate funding proposals. The basic economics behind their calculation 
is not obscure, however: Increased strategic freedom for network providers increases 
the strategic risk for investments. Increased risks lowers the number of efficient in-
vestments.

Question  1.  It  has  been  stated  numerous  times  that  there  isn’t  sufficient 
broadband  ISP  competition.  While  some  markets  (more  metropolitan  and  urban 
areas) do have robust competition, most markets have an effective duopoly that con-
trols  access  to  high  speed  Internet  connections.  How  would  you  assess  the  current 
direction  of  broadband  competition  given  the  emergence  of  wireless  broadband  and 
broadband over power lines (BPL) services? Is competition growing? 

Answer.  Competition  is  growing,  but  I  don’t  believe  quickly  enough,  or  with  the 
right business model. The long term threat to the Internet comes from platform pro-
viders  with  a  business  model  that  depends  upon  leveraging  value  out  of  Internet 
applications  and  content.  The  long  term  solution  is  broadband  providers  who,  like 
providers  of  electricity,  have  no  interest  in  the  content  or  applications  running  on 
the network. 

Question 2. Why isn’t there more competition in the Broadband space? What bar-

riers to entry are hindering new entrants? 

Answer.  No  doubt  the  most  important  barrier  is  the  high  cost  of  building  infra-
structure.  But  the  government  could  take  steps  to  encourage  more  competition.  Se-
curing more reliable access to local right of ways would be one. More unlicensed (or 
effectively  so)  spectrum  would  be  another.  A  return  to  some  of  the  ‘‘open  access’’ 
policies of the late 1990s would be a third. I would strongly encourage the first two. 
Question  3.  What  specific  recommendations  do  you  have  for  us  to  craft  effective 

policy that would promote more competition in this market space? 

You  have  mentioned  that  this  innovation  has  come  primarily  from  the  ‘‘edge’’  or 
‘‘end’’ of the network through application competition. And that the original Internet 
embraced  an  ‘‘end-to-end’’  design,  meaning  the  network  itself  was  to  be  as  simple 
as  possible,  with  intelligence  for  the  network  provided  by  applications  that  con-
nected at the edge of the network. But given this ‘‘edge innovation’’ has created new 
Internet services and applications, and content has become more dynamic and larg-
er  as  well  as  more  time-sensitive  with  the  increasing  prevalence  of  voice  and  video 
traffic,  doesn’t  the  network  itself  have  to  become  more  intelligent  to  deal  with  the 
dizzying array of content and to ensure efficient delivery of the content and success-
ful use of the applications and services?

Answer. No. The truth of the end-to-end design didn’t depend upon the simplicity 
of  the  applications  on  the  network.  It  reflects  a  technical  judgment  about  where  in 
the  network  it  is  most  efficient  to  locate  network-like  services  (the  ‘‘ends’’).  But  the 
consequence  of  that  technical  design  was  a  platform  that  maximized  the  range  of 
competition that was possible on that network. 

Question  4.  There  has  been  an  explosion  of  bandwidth  intensive  content—pri-
marily  with  video.  Broadband  providers  seem  to  constantly  be  playing  catch-up  in 
upgrading  their  infrastructure  to  meet  the  growing  demand.  While  broadband  pro-
viders can do more, what are content and application providers doing in developing 
new  technologies  to  assist  in  dealing  with  the  near-term  bandwidth  shortage  that 
may  exist  in  certain  areas—such  as  utilizing  compression  technologies  or  using 
multicasting over P2P? 

Answer.  P2P  itself  is  a  technology  to  more  efficiently  use  network  resources,  by 
sharing the performance requirements among a number of different uses. But more 
fundamentally,  I  don’t  think  the  government  can  do  anything  in  particular  to  en-
courage one kind of technical development over another, and nor should it. The most 
(and  least)  the  government  should  do  is  create  the  right  competitive  environment 
for the market in applications and content to flourish. 

Question  5.  Are  content  and  applications  providers  designing  their  products 

around current network constraints that exist? 

Answer.  Yes,  as  they  always  will,  as  there  will  always,  on  the  margin,  be  a  con-
straint.  The  problem  is  the  constraint  now  is  so  significant  that  the  work-arounds 
are too severe, weakening competitive opportunity.

Question 1. When you testified before this Committee in 2006, you stated that net-
work neutrality has been part of telecommunications law for 40 years. However, the 
Internet backbone has never been subject to network neutrality regulations or prin-
ciples. And Mr. McSlarrow’s member-companies have never been subject to network 
neutrality regulations or principles. 

How  could  network  neutrality  principles  be  such  an  integral  part  of  how  the 
Internet  has  operated  when  neither  backbone  providers  nor  cable  modem  services, 
which still have more broadband customers than any other type of broadband serv-
ice, have ever been subject to network neutrality requirements? 

Answer. It is correct that backbone providers haven’t been subject to legal regula-
tion.  But  the  competitive  environment  they  have  operated  within  has  never  given 
them  the  incentive  to  discriminate  in  ways  that  weaken  the  end-to-end  character 
of  the  Internet’s  design.  My  point  was  that  Title  II  Internet  services—the  core  of 
early  network  growth—had  been  subject  to  a  range  of  regulations  that  drove  pro-
viders away from a discriminatory business model, which effected neutrality. 

Question 2. I know you work with Tim Wu on these issues. Dr. Wu made the fol-

lowing comment in The Economist a year ago when talking about net neutrality: 

Answer.  ‘‘The  public  reaction  has  already  been  as  powerful  and  effective  as  any 
law,’’  says  Timothy  Wu,  a  professor  at  Columbia  Law  School  who  is  credited  with 
coining  the  term  ‘‘net  neutrality’’.  The  debate  has  put  the  telecoms  companies  on 
notice  that  they  are  being  watched  closely,  he  says,  and  has  forced  them  to  make 
public  pledges  not  to  block  or  degrade  access.  ‘‘Shame  can  have  more  power  than 
litigation,’’  says  Mr  Wu.  ‘‘The  market  and  consumers  can  control  bad  practices,  but 
consumers actually have to be aware of what is going on for that to happen.’’ 

Question  3.  Why  can’t  the  market  (including  Internet  companies,  application  pro-
viders, consumers, and a vigilant FCC, monitoring activities) work in ensuring that 
bad actors are stopped? 

Answer.  Investment  decisions  will  be  based  upon  the  expectation  of  the  competi-
tive environment at the time when the investment needs to earn a return. My view 
is that a clear Federal policy would more effectively signal the competitive environ-
ment  in  the  future  than  the  (often  fickle)  attitudes  of  public  activism.  Of  course, 
there’s  no  way  to  be  certain.  It  may  well  be  that  the  activists  would  be  sufficient. 
But that work is complemented by clear Federal policy signaling the values this in-
frastructure will require. 

Question 4. Why do we need more regulation today? 
Answer.  In  my  view,  the  government  should  adopt  a  minimal  additional  regula-
tion to assure that business models that depend upon scarcity do not develop. That 
addition would complement the Internet Freedoms currently embraced by the FCC, 
by  adding  a  requirement  that  any  tiering  done  by  an  Internet  provider  be  offered

on  similar  terms  to  any  other  provider.  So  if  a  provider  charges  a  premium  price 
for  video  content,  it  would  have  to  offer  that  same  price  to  anyone.  That  additional 
regulation  focuses  upon  contracts;  it  doesn’t  require  additional  supervision  of  tech-
nology.  And  it  puts  significant  pressure  on  a  business  model  that  envisions 
leveraging rents out of network scarcity.
