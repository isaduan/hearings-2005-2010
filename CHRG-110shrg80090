NOMINATION  OF  JOHN  P.  HEWKO  TO  BE 

ASSISTANT  SECRETARY  OF  TRANSPORTATION 

TUESDAY,  JULY  29,  2008 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:30  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Daniel  K.  Inouye, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Hewko, I thank you very much for appearing 
before  us  today  to  consider  your  nomination  to  become  Assistant 
Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, United States De-
partment  of  Transportation.  We  look  forward  to  learning  about 
your  views  on  relevant  issues  and  how  your  past  experiences  have 
prepared you to live up to the job. 

The  DOT,  as  you  know,  Mr.  Hewko,  faces  significant  challenges 
in  ensuring  our  transportation  system  operates  swiftly  and  safely 
and  efficiently.  As  the  Assistant  Secretary  for  Aviation  and  Inter-
national Affairs, you will be directly involved in three policy issues 
that  are  of  special  concern  to  us—the  implementation  of  slot  auc-
tions in New York City airports, the Essential Air Service Program, 
and  the  ongoing  Open  Skies  negotiations  between  the  United 
States and the European Union. 

And  in  dealing  with  these  issues,  we  expect  you  to  work  closely 
and communicate clearly with this Committee because I believe we 
must work together to find the best path for both the White House 
and  the  legislative  branch.  A  good  relationship  between  Congress 
and  DOT  is  vital  if  we  are  going  to  find  solutions  to  these  chal-
lenges and improve the quality of our transportation system. 

So I look forward to listening to your testimony. And may I now 

call upon the Vice Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Stevens? 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator  STEVENS.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  very  much  for  hold-

ing this hearing. 

I  think  this  vacancy  should  be  filled  as  quickly  as  possible.  I 
don’t think I need to mention to our witness that my state depends 
upon air transportation more than any other state in the union. 

The CHAIRMAN. Other than Hawaii. 
[Laughter.]

Senator STEVENS. Well, I even challenge that, Mr. Chairman, be-
cause we have 241 villages, 70 percent of our areas can be reached 
only by air year round. I think you have more passengers than we 
do,  obviously.  It  is  much  easier  to  go  to  the  sun  country  than  it  is 
to the snow country. 

But as a general problem, our state is different. One out of every 
58 people in our state is a pilot. We have 6 planes for every 10 pi-
lots.  We  have  more  general  aviation  per  capita  than,  I  think,  any-
where in the world, and yet we have to rely upon this type of trans-
portation, the unscheduled planes that fly food to our villages, and 
medical  service.  They  deliver  babies.  They  do  every  single  thing 
that taxis and buses and trains do in what we call the ‘‘South 48.’’ 
So  I  think  rural  air  service  is  absolutely  essential  to  our  State, 
and I hope you have been to Alaska. If you haven’t, I want to invite 
you  to  come  to  Alaska  and  really  see.  We  pioneered  Capstone.  We 
pioneered changes in the air system. We have proven the new sys-
tems.  If  they  can  work  in  Alaska,  they  will  work  anywhere  in  the 
United States. 

So  we  are  proud  to  be  part  of  that  activity  of  proving  new  tech-
nology,  and  we  want  to  hasten  the  advent  of  new  technology.  But 
we want to preserve the ability to continue to have these small air-
craft fly and fly safely for our people. 

So  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you,  and  I  really  thank  the 
Chairman  for  having  this  hearing.  I  do  hope  this  is  not  one  of  the 
nominations  that  will  be  held  up.  I  think  that  it  is  essential  that 
that  one  spot  that  you  will  occupy  be  filled  as  quickly  as  possible. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Before  we  proceed,  Mr.  Hewko,  our  apologies  to  you.  I  was  just 
advised that we called you out of vacation. So your family must be 
not quite happy about it, but we will make it up to them. 

And you have your parents here. Why don’t you present them for 

the record? 

Mr. HEWKO. Thank you very much. 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to acknowledge my parents, Lubomyr 
and  Natalie  Hewko,  who  traveled  from  Detroit  to  be  here  today. 
And  I  would  also  like  to  say  hello  to  my  wife,  Margarita,  and  my 
daughter, Maria, who weren’t able to come today, but are hopefully 
watching the proceedings by Internet in Utah, and to thank my col-
leagues  from  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation  for  having 
joined me here this morning. 

The CHAIRMAN. Please proceed, sir. 

STATEMENT  OF  JOHN  P.  HEWKO,  NOMINEE  TO  BE  ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY  FOR  AVIATION  AND  INTERNATIONAL  AFFAIRS, 
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 
Mr.  HEWKO.  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  and 
Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  ap-
pear before you today as you consider my nomination to be Assist-
ant  Secretary  of  Transportation  for  Aviation  and  International  Af-
fairs  at  the  Department  of  Transportation.  It  is  a  great  honor  to 
be  asked  by  President  Bush  and  Secretary  Peters  to  serve  in  this 
important position.

If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with the Members 
of  this  Committee  and  your  staffs  in  addressing  the  many  crucial 
aviation  and  international  transportation  issues  facing  the  United 
States today. 

I  would  like  publicly  to  thank  and  acknowledge  my  wife,  Mar-
garita,  and  daughter,  Maria,  and  my  siblings  Marc  and  Annetta 
Hewko. Unfortunately, they are unable to be here today. 

I  would  also  like  to  recognize  my  parents,  Lubomyr  and  Natalie 
Hewko, who came to this country after the Second World War from 
Ukraine  by  way  of  displaced  persons  refugee  camps  in  Bavaria. 
Their  experiences,  particularly  those  under  Stalin’s  Communism 
and  Hitler’s  Nazism,  have  given  me  a  keen  appreciation  of  the  ex-
traordinary  country  we  live  in  and  of  the  importance  of  freedom, 
democracy, hard work, and dedication. This appreciation and a de-
sire to give back to the country that opened its arms to my parents 
has motivated my interest in public service. 

If  confirmed,  there  are  a  number  of  skills  that  I  would  bring  to 
this  position.  I  have  a  very  strong  international  background,  hav-
ing spent many years living and working outside the United States. 
In  my  current  position  at  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation, 
I  have  primary  responsibility  for  negotiating  MCC’s  foreign  assist-
ance  agreements  with  26  countries  in  Africa,  Asia,  Latin  America, 
the Middle East, and the former Soviet Union. 

Most  of  these  agreements  contain  significant  transportation 
projects, and the experience of negotiating them underscored to me 
the  critical  importance  of  the  transportation  infrastructure  to  a 
country’s economic prosperity. 

If  confirmed,  I  will  also  bring  a  strong  management  background 
to  the  position.  This  management  experience  will  be  particularly 
important  during  the  upcoming  transition  to  the  new  administra-
tion.  Finally,  as  someone  from  outside  the  aviation  sector,  I  would 
bring a fresh perspective to many of the issues currently facing the 
industry. 

Although  the  term  of  this  administration  will  soon  end,  there 
still remain many important issues that need to be addressed. The 
state of the domestic air transportation industry, resulting from the 
rising cost of fuel and how the industry is responding, will require 
significant attention. A number of smaller, yet very important pro-
grams, such as Essential Air Service, will need continued and effec-
tive stewardship. 

I would hope to focus on a number of the Open Skies Agreements 
currently  being  negotiated,  with  the  goal  of  increasing  access  for 
American  carriers  and  communities  to  international  markets.  Fi-
nally,  it  is  important  to  ensure  a  smooth,  efficient,  and  orderly 
transition to the new administration in January 2009. 

Mr.  Chairman,  if  confirmed,  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you 
and  the  Members  of  Congress  on  these  and  other  critical  issues.  I 
would  come  to  this  position  with  an  open  mind  and  a  keen  desire 
to find solutions to problems that are fair and take into account the 
concerns  of  the  affected  stakeholders  and  the  best  interests  of  the 
American people. 

Again,  I  am  grateful  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you 
today  as  you  consider  my  nomination,  and  I  look  forward  to  an-
swering any questions you may have.

I  have  given  over  100  speeches  and  presentations  through  the  years  in  the  U.S. 

and abroad. The topics have generally fallen into the following categories for: 

7 

Speeches related to MCC or official USG matters. 
• Several commencement speeches at universities. 
• Doing business in the former Soviet Union. 
• Doing business in the Russia, Ukraine and the Czech Republic. 
• Doing business in emerging markets. 
• Speeches describing my travel experiences. 
• Speeches to foreign audiences on the U.S. political system. 
• Speeches on foreign affairs, particularly with respect to the former Soviet Union 
• Commentary on foreign affairs on television news and talk shows. 
• Participation in panel discussions on legal and foreign affairs issues. 
• Lectures at universities on legal and foreign affairs issues. 
17.  Please  identify  each  instance  in  which  you  have  testified  orally  or  in  writing 
before  Congress  in  a  governmental  or  non-governmental  capacity  and  specify  the 
date and subject matter of each testimony: None. 

and Latin America. 

18.  Given  the  current  mission,  major  programs,  and  major  operational  objectives 
of  the  department/agency  to  which  you  have  been  nominated,  what  in  your  back-
ground  or  employment  experience  do  you  believe  affirmatively  qualifies  you  for  ap-
pointment to the position for which you have been nominated, and why do you wish 
to serve in that position? 

I returned to the United States in 2001 after many years abroad because I wanted 
to  become  involved  in  public  service.  My  parents  immigrated  to  the  United  States 
after  the  Second  World  War  and  I  very  much  wished  to  give  back  to  the  country 
that  was  so  open  and  hospitable  to  my  parents  and  family.  I  have  been  very  fortu-
nate to have had the opportunity to serve for the past 4 years as a senior executive 
with the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a U.S. Government agency, and would 
be  honored  to  be  able  to  continue  my  public  service,  if  confirmed,  for  this  position. 
I  believe  that  my  strong  management  and  extensive  international  experience  in 
both  the  public  and  private  sectors  qualifies  me  for  appointment  to  this  position. 
Transportation infrastructure and systems are crucial to the growth and well-being 
of the U.S. economy. Many of the MCC Compacts that I negotiated with our partner 
countries  include  significant  transportation  related  projects;  this  has  further  in-
creased  my  interest  in,  and  understanding  of,  transportation  issues,  particularly  in 
the international context. 

19. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure that the 
department/agency  has  proper  management  and  accounting  controls,  and  what  ex-
perience do you have in managing a large organization? 

I  have  extensive  management  experience  in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors. 
I  was  the  founding  and  managing  partner  of  the  Baker  &  McKenzie  office  in  Kyiv, 
Ukraine.  In  that  capacity,  I  was  responsible  for  starting  a  practice  and  office  in  a 
very  difficult  environment  and  had  primary  oversight  for  all  aspects  of  office  man-
agement:  human  resources,  client  development,  associate  training,  financial  and 
budget matters, billing, negotiation of office leases, government relations, etc. I was 
also  the  managing  partner  of  the  Baker  &  McKenzie  Prague  office  where  I  was 
asked  to  revive  a  troubled  office  in  a  very  competitive  market.  This  position  had 
managerial responsibilities similar to that of the Kyiv position, with the added com-
plexity of having to terminate a large number of individuals and then to rebuild an 
office almost from the beginning. 

As  a  Vice  President  at  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation  (MCC),  I  managed 
the  largest  department  in  the  institution  and  was  responsible  for  managing  MCC’s 
relationship with its 26 Compact eligible countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, 
Latin  America  and  the  former  Soviet  Union.  My  position  at  MCC  requires  signifi-
cant foreign travel, extensive dealings with heads of state and senior foreign govern-
ment  officials,  public  outreach  and  participation  in  interagency  policy  discussions. 
20.  What  do  you  believe  to  be  the  top  three  challenges  facing  the  department/ 

agency, and why? 

(1)  The  agency’s  principal  challenge  is  maintaining  and  improving  safety 
throughout the country’s transportation network. A focus on safety not only re-
duces  transportation  related  deaths  and  injuries,  but  instills  public  confidence 
in the transportation system. 
(2)  Addressing  congestion  in  the  transportation  network  is  a  further  challenge. 
U.S. economic growth, particularly in an era when international trade is becom-

ing increasingly important, depends on an efficiently functioning transportation 
system. Inefficient domestic and international freight movement, long delays at 
airports  and  congestion  on  our  Nation’s  highways  inhibit  economic  growth  and 
affect negatively overall prosperity in the United States. 
(3) The country’s highway and air traffic infrastructure is aging and in need of 
repair and renovation. Transportation infrastructure is the backbone of the U.S. 
economy and it must be maintained and upgraded to keep pace with population 
growth and to permit the United States to compete effectively in an increasingly 
global market.

I  just  have  one  question.  In  recent  days,  front  pages  have  been 
covered  with  congestion  in  the  skies  and  also  near  misses.  Would 
the auction slots in New York and Newark ease this congestion? 

Mr. HEWKO. Well, Senator, congestion is a significant and serious 
problem.  Delays  are  a  big  problem  in  our  system.  They  cost  the 
economy billions of dollars each year, not to mention the inconven-
iences  that  consumers  face  in  terms  of  missed  holidays,  weddings, 
delays at the airport. 

I know that the administration is attempting to increase capacity 
and  efficiency,  and  my  understanding  is  that  the  administration 
has proposed limited market-based mechanisms as a potential part 
of  the  solution  to  congestion  in  areas  such  as  New  York.  I  am  not 
familiar  with  the  details  of  the  auction  system.  I  do  understand 
that  it  is  opposed  by  the  airlines  and  is  a  controversial  measure. 
But  if  confirmed,  I  look  forward  to  understanding  this  issue  bet-
ter,  and  if  confirmed,  I  certainly  would  commit  to  working  very 
closely  with  you  on  the  various  issues  that  these  mechanisms  give 
rise to. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Stevens? 
Senator  STEVENS.  Mr.  Hewko,  I  have  been  reading  your  back-
ground, and I think that we should congratulate you for being will-
ing  to  leave  the  very  interesting  position  you  have  had  to  take  on 
this very serious and difficult job. And I am interested in particular 
that  you  were  a  visiting  scholar  at  the  Carnegie  Endowment  for 
International Peace, your time that you spent overseas. 

I am sure you have seen the difference between traveling in Eu-
rope  and  traveling  in  the  United  States.  I  like  to  remind  people 
that  my  State  alone  is  larger  than  Italy,  Germany,  France,  and 
Spain.  What  we  have  here,  we  are  only  one-fifth  the  size  of  the 
United  States.  So  that  is  at  least  five  times  the  area  that  Europe 
deals  with  on  their  daily  transportation  that  we  deal  with,  very 
complex mechanism, but one that has to be improved. 

New technology will give us the opportunity to decrease the spac-
ing  between  these  large  planes  that  now  land  at  better  than  100 
miles an hour. And I do think that a person with your background 
will  have  the  ability  to  take  a  look  at  this  situation  and  see  what 
can be done now. 

We get increasing complaints, I am sure you know, from the pub-
lic, the traveling public as far as these delays and the failure to be 
able to handle some of the things that happen these days. 

Have  you  had  a  chance  to  be  briefed  as  far  as  your  activities  as 
far as the transportation side of your job as compared to the inter-
national affairs side of your job? 

Mr. HEWKO. Well, first of all, Senator, I would like to thank you 
for  your  kind  invitation  to  visit  your  state.  I  have  not  had  the 
pleasure  of  visiting  Alaska,  but  I  very  much  hope  that  during  the 
course  of  my  tenure  in  the  job,  I  will  be  able  to  visit  your  State 
and experience firsthand the various transportation challenges that 
you have outlined. 

And  I  also  share  your  concern  about  the  congestion  issue,  and 
again, I very much appreciate the unique nature of Alaska and Ha-
waii  as  well,  Mr.  Chairman,  when  it  comes  to  transportation 
issues.

In terms of my briefings with the department, I have had several 
short  meetings  with  staff  there,  and  they  have  been  very  helpful 
in giving me a general sense of some of these issues, especially the 
issue that you just raised, Senator. 

And  again,  if  confirmed,  I  look  forward  to  understanding  the 
issues  better  and  to  working  very  closely  with  you  and  your  staff 
to try to come to some practical solutions to these very, very impor-
tant problems. 

Senator STEVENS. Well, how much do you feel that your task will 

involve international affairs as compared to domestic affairs? 

Mr.  HEWKO.  Well,  it  is  hard  to  say  at  this  point  because  I  have 
not  had  a  chance  to  be  in  the  job.  But  my  understanding  is  that 
the  portfolio  includes  aviation,  but  it  also  includes  international 
transportation  and  trade  issues.  And  given  that  my  background  is 
in the international area, I would certainly hope to devote a consid-
erable amount of my energies to that area. 

But  everything  is  important.  I  think  all  of  the  issues  that  this 
office will face merit attention—some, obviously, more than others. 
But I would anticipate a great deal of time spent, both on the avia-
tion side of things and on the international side. 

Senator STEVENS. Have you had any occasion to study the Euro-

pean systems of regulation of traffic as compared to ours? 

Mr.  HEWKO.  Well,  again,  I  don’t  come  to  this  job  with  a  strong 
aviation  background,  but  I  do  understand  that  the  staff  at  the  de-
partment is extremely strong and has been looking at these issues 
for  many  years.  I  do  have  a  good  feel  for  the  European  system  in 
general,  having  lived  and  worked  in  European  countries  for  many 
years.  And  my  overall  impression  is  that  in  Europe,  things  are 
often  a  little  bit  more  bureaucratic,  a  little  more  burdensome  than 
in our system. 

But again, if confirmed, this is an issue that I would clearly want 
to get up to speed on and work closely with you and your staffs on. 
Senator STEVENS. Well, they don’t have as much general aviation 
traffic  like  we  do,  as  I  understand  it.  I  do  hope  you  will  take  a 
chance  to  learn  something  about  that  before  you  make  judgments 
concerning  the  activities  of  rural  general  aviation  and  what  it 
means to this country. 

That is why we would like to have you visit Alaska and see some 
of  the  places  that  small  planes  serve.  They  are  the  only  form  of 
transportation.  Without  that  general  aviation,  there  wouldn’t  be 
any transportation. In days gone by, it was the dog sled in summer 
and  walking,  literally  walking—it  was  in  the  wintertime  when  my 
first  partner  walked  from  Nome  to  Fairbanks,  when  he  wanted  to 
move to Fairbanks. 

Now  this  is  a  changing  country.  We  don’t  do  that  anymore.  But 
we  now  rely  on  general  aviation  in  such  ways  as  I  am  becoming 
too redundant here and now, but I do hope that you will take time 
to  understand  general  aviation  before  you  make  decisions  that 
might affect us in the international area. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
The record will show that Mr. Hewko has filed all the necessary 
documents,  responded  to  all,  and  I  think  people  should  read  your 
record. It is a very impressive one.

Without  objection,  this  matter  will  be  referred  to  the  full  Com-
mittee  on  Thursday,  and  at  that  time,  I  am  certain  it  will  be  ap-
proved and reported to the Senate. 

Congratulations, sir. And the hearing is adjourned. 
Mr. HEWKO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
