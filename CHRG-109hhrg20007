HEARING CHARTER

SUBCOMMITTEE ON SPACE AND AERONAUTICS

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

The Future of

Aeronautics at NASA

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 16, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  Wednesday,  March  16,  at  10:00  a.m.,  the  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aero-
nautics  will  hold  a  hearing  on  the  proposed  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2006  budget  for  aero-
nautics at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA).

The  budget  proposes  significant  changes  in  NASA’s  aeronautic  programs,  includ-
ing, over the next five years, dramatic cuts in funding and staffing, closure of facili-
ties,  and  redirection  of  research  priorities.  NASA  argues  that  these  proposed
changes  would  enable  NASA  to  focus  on  the  highest  priority  areas  in  aeronautics
while freeing up Agency funds for space exploration programs, the Agency’s highest
priority.

NASA  has  played  a  role  in  advancing  aeronautics  since  its  inception.  Indeed,
NASA  was  created  by  expanding  the  National  Advisory  Committee  on  Aeronautics
(NACA),  a  federal  agency  created  in  1917  to  promote  aeronautics.  NASA’s  Langley
Research Center in Virginia, one of its aeronautics centers, dates back to 1917.

Today,  aeronautics  programs  are  run  by  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Research  Mission
Directorate (ARMD). No other federal agency supports research on civilian aircraft.
NASA’s aeronautics program also conducts most of the research on air traffic control
systems, a responsibility it shares with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
The Aeronautics Directorate includes three NASA Centers: Glenn Research Center,
Ohio;  Dryden  Research  Center,  California;  and  Langley  Research  Center,  Virginia.
Overarching Questions

The  Committee  plans  to  explore  the  following  overarching  questions  at  the  hear-

ing:

1. What  are  the  trends  in  civil  aeronautics  and  what  should  the  U.S.  national

strategy be for civil aeronautics research and development?

2. What  is  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  strategy  and  how  well  does  it  align

with the Nation’s strategic needs for civil aeronautics research?

3. Should  NASA  preserve  its  inventory  of  wind  tunnels  and  propulsion  test  fa-

cilities until a new national strategy can be developed and funded?

4. How  does  NASA  intend  to  achieve  the  workforce  reductions  it  has  proposed

without losing essential skills and capabilities?

FY06 Aeronautics Budget Highlights

Over  the  last  decade,  funding  for  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  has  declined  by
more than half, to about $900 million. For FY06, NASA proposes a relatively small
decrease ($54 million, or about six percent) in aeronautics research and development
compared  to  its  FY05  Operating  Plan.  But  the  Agency’s  proposed  five-year  runout
for  aeronautics  contemplates  substantial  funding  reductions  (20  percent)  for  aero-
nautics  research,  together  with  significant  cutbacks  in  its  civil  service  and  con-
tractor workforces.

Civil  service  personnel  and  infrastructure  costs  account  for  much  of  the  Aero-
nautics  Directorate’s  budget,  largely  because  of  the  expenses  involved  in  the  oper-
ation and maintenance of NASA’s 31 wind tunnels.

This  is  not  the  case  for  other  portions  of  NASA,  for  which  grants  and  contracts
account for much of the cost. As a result, while the Aeronautics Directorate receives
only  six  percent  of  NASA’s  total  budget,  it  employs  23  percent  of  the  entire  NASA
workforce and is responsible for 40 percent of all of NASA’s infrastructure costs.

The Aeronautics Directorate comprises three programs—the Vehicle Systems Pro-
gram,  the  Aviation  Safety  and  Security  Program,  and  the  Airspace  Systems  Pro-
gram.  The  Administration’s  proposed  budget  for  the  next  five  years  for  these  three
programmatic areas is shown below:

Vehicle Systems

Vehicle  Systems  emphasizes  research  in  traditional  air  vehicle  design  concepts
(examples being wing designs and high-speed aircraft), and for FY06, takes the big-
gest cut among the three programs (down $109 million compared to FY05, a 19 per-
cent reduction). The proposed budget would make further reductions in the program
in FY07, resulting in a cut of 33 percent (compared to FY05).

The cuts would be made by narrowing the program’s focus beginning in FY06. The
program  would  concentrate  on  projects  designed  to  make  significant  leaps  forward
on  technology  and  less  on  incremental  changes.  Specifically,  the  program  would
focus on four areas: (1) zero emissions aircraft—to demonstrate an aircraft powered
by  fuel  cells;  (2)  subsonic  noise  reduction—to  demonstrate  a  50  percent  reduction
in  noise  compared  to  1997  state-of-the-art;  (3)  high  altitude  long  endurance
(HALE)—to  demonstrate  a  14-day  duration  high  altitude,  remotely  operated  air-
craft; and (4) sonic boom reduction—to demonstrate technology that could enable ac-
ceptable sonic boom levels.

Research  activities  proposed  for  termination  in  the  FY06  Vehicle  Systems  pro-
gram  include  hypersonics  (higher-speed  aircraft),  rotorcraft  (helicopters),  and  im-
provements in engine efficiency.

To  conduct  its  research,  Vehicle  Systems  relies  heavily  on  wind  tunnels  and  pro-
pulsion test facilities. The proposed budget appears to assume the closure of one or
more of these facilities with associated cutbacks in staff (see below). However, NASA
has  not  released  any  information  on  which  facilities  it  would  close  or  when,  or  the
criteria on which closure decisions would be based.

In  arguing  for  the  proposed  changes  in  the  Vehicle  Systems  Program,  NASA  has
cited  a  2004  National  Academy  of  Sciences  report,  ‘‘Review  of  NASA’s  Aerospace
Technology  Enterprise:  An  Assessment  of  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Technology  Pro-
gram,’’ led by Dr. John Klineberg. The report did recommend that NASA reduce the
number  of  research  projects  it  conducted,  stating,  ‘‘NASA  is  trying  to  do  too  much
within  the  available  budget  and  resists  eliminating  programs  in  the  face  of  budget
reductions.’’  It  also  concluded  that  NASA’s  ‘‘aeronautics  technology  infrastructure
exceeds  its  current  needs,  and  the  Agency  should  continue  to  dispose  of  underuti-
lized  assets  and  facilities.’’  But  while  the  Academy  report  listed  individual  projects
it  thought  were  a  low  priority,  it  did  not  recommend  the  elimination  of  whole  cat-
egories  of  research  as  NASA  has  proposed.  The  report  also  did  not  elaborate  on  its
recommendation concerning underutilized facilities. (A summary of the report is at-
tached.)
Airspace Systems

Airspace  Systems  supports  research  to  improve  air  traffic  management.  In  con-
junction with FAA, NASA is supporting the Joint Planning and Development Office,
which  is  overseeing  the  effort  to  develop  a  next-generation  air  traffic  management
system.  The  Airspace  Systems  program  would  receive  the  largest  increase  of  the
programs  within  NASA’s  aeronautics  portfolio  in  the  FY06  budget,  increasing  by
$48 million or about 32 percent. However, the program would still receive less than
it did in FY04, and it would receive less in subsequent years. The increase in FY06
would be used to provide more funds for a number of software development projects,
whose budgets would remain flat after that. A number of current projects would be
completed during the out-years, resulting in the drop in overall funding for the pro-
gram.
Aviation Safety and Security

The Aviation Safety and Security program conducts research to prevent the most
common  types  of  fatal  accidents  in  aviation,  such  as  planes  colliding  with  moun-
tainous terrain or other obstacles on the ground, and eliminating intrusions by other
aircraft  onto  active  runways.  It  also  seeks  to  develop  concepts  and  technologies  to
reduce  the  vulnerability  of  aircraft  and  the  National  Airspace  System  to  criminal
and  terrorist  attacks  while  improving  the  efficiency  of  security.  For  FY06,  NASA
proposes to increase funding for this program by $7.5 million, or about four percent.
The program would receive less funding in the out years.
Personnel

The proposed cuts in the aeronautics budget would be achieved, in part, by reduc-
ing  the  workforce.  NASA  has  not  specified  what  skills  would  no  longer  be  needed
because  of  programmatic  changes  or  how  the  personnel  cuts  might  be  linked  to  fa-
cilities cuts. It is unclear whether NASA decided how many employees would be cut
based on budget targets, or whether the Agency decided how many employees would
no longer be needed for programmatic reasons and then calculated how much money
would be saved as a result, or some combination.

Acting Administrator Fred Gregory testified on February 17 that no one at NASA
would  be  laid  off  involuntarily  before  FY07,  raising  the  question  of  what  NASA
would do if buyout offers did not result in the expected reductions.

Issues

The Committee plans to explore the following issues at the hearing:

• What  would  the  impact  of  the  proposed  cuts  be  on  American  civil  avia-

tion?
This  critical  question  is  difficult  to  answer  at  this  point  because  NASA  has  not
made clear exactly what would be cut, particularly in terms of facilities and job cat-
egories.

What  is  clear  is  that  the  cuts  would  come  at  a  critical  time  for  the  U.S.  aviation
industry.  The  sole  surviving  American  manufacturer  of  large  civil  aircraft,  Boeing,
is facing ever stiffer competition from its European competitor, Airbus. The two U.S.
turbine  engine  manufacturers,  General  Electric  and  Pratt  and  Whitney,  also  face
tough  competition.  It  is  not  clear  what  kind  of  research  would  be  most  helpful  to
U.S. industry and to U.S. aviation generally. Clearly, the air traffic control and en-
vironmental  issues  on  which  NASA  intends  to  focus  would  be  at  the  top  of  any  re-
search priority list.

In terms of vehicle systems research, NASA is looking at eliminating incremental
research,  but  this  is  the  research  that  companies  are  likely  to  be  most  interested
in  as  they  can  quickly  adopt  its  results.  But  some  experts  argue  that  industry
should pay for shorter-term research on its own.

One  example  of  shorter-term  research  that  NASA  is  backing  out  of  is  rotorcraft
research.  This  concerns  helicopter  manufacturers  who  argue  that  helicopters  are
still an ‘‘immature technology’’ for which many improvements are possible and that
foreign competition is increasing.

But  NASA  has  had  a  mixed  record  with  the  kind  of  far-ranging  research  it  pro-
poses  to  focus  on.  In  the  past,  it  has  discontinued  many  revolutionary  technology
programs before they were completed. For example, in the FY06 budget, NASA pro-
poses  to  end  work  on  hypersonics  (which  included  a  high-profile  test  late  last  year
of the X–43A scramjet, which set a new record for speed).

One  reason  for  the  uncertainty  about  what  approach  NASA  should  take  is  that
NASA  has  no  overarching  plan  for  aeronautics,  in  contrast  to  the  way  the  Presi-
dent’s Exploration Vision is setting the agenda for the exploration programs and the
way  that  National  Academy  of  Sciences  priority-setting  exercises  guide  NASA’s
science  programs.  NASA  is  in  the  process  of  funding  several  efforts  to  develop  an
aeronautics  agenda.  This  month,  a  study  funded  by  the  National  Institute  of  Aero-
nautics,  a  university  consortium,  is  due  to  make  recommendations.  This  summer,
an internal NASA ‘‘roadmapping’’ exercise (which includes outside advisory commit-
tees)  is  scheduled  to  lay  out  a  plan  for  aeronautics.  And  in  late  2006,  the  National
Academy  of  Sciences  is  expected  to  complete  a  ‘‘decadal  survey’’  for  aeronautics
(based on similar surveys done in space science) that would lay out a consensus on
priorities in aeronautics over the next ten years.
• What would be the impact of NASA closing wind tunnels?

NASA  currently  operates  31  wind  tunnels,  with  widely  varying  utilization  rates.
Wind  tunnels  are  very  expensive  to  build  and  operate,  and  their  designs  are  care-
fully tailored to achieve precise flow conditions within a narrow range of speed and
altitude.  No  single  wind  tunnel  is  suitable  for  replicating  all  flight  conditions  (e.g.,
high  and  fast  as  well  as  low  and  slow).  Throughout  the  world,  most  wind  tunnels
are  supported  by  governments.  Over  the  past  two  decades  NASA  has  reduced  its
number of wind tunnels and propulsion test facilities by one-third.

NASA  commissioned  a  study  last  year  from  RAND,  which  concluded  that  NASA
should  continue  to  operate  29  of  its  31  wind  tunnels.  RAND  estimated  the  annual
operating  cost  of  all  31  tunnels  to  be  $125–$130  million.  RAND  argued  that  while
some  of  the  tunnels  were  not  well  used  now,  they  offered  capabilities  that  could  be
needed  in  the  future  and  that  would  be  hard  to  replicate  if  the  tunnels  were  shut
down.  RAND  also  argued  that  while  some  questions  that  once  needed  to  be  solved
with wind tunnels could now be answered through computer simulation, many crit-
ical  questions  still  required  wind  tunnels.  It  also  said  that  wind  tunnel  data  were
sometimes needed to develop computer simulation software.

In  addition  to  NASA  itself,  industry  and  the  Department  of  Defense  use  NASA
wind tunnels. NASA has increased the fees it charges industry to use its wind tun-
nels,  now  basing  charges  on  the  full  cost  of  maintaining  a  wind  tunnel  rather  than
on  the  incremental  cost  of  the  specific  work  being  done.  Because  of  increased  fees
and because of the age and limitations of some of NASA’s facilities, U.S. companies
are more frequently using foreign wind tunnels. This has raised issues about wheth-
er  the  U.S.  should  be  wary  of  becoming  dependent  on  foreign  facilities  as  well  as
concerns about whether trade secrets may be lost in using foreign tunnels.

Background
NASA’s Aeronautics Research

Virtually every airplane flying today employs technological innovations developed
by  NASA.  Examples  include  the  high-bypass  turbine  engine  that  provides  much
greater fuel efficiency and lower noise emissions than original 1960’s-era jet engines;
‘‘fly-by-wire’’  control  systems  that  use  computers  and  wires  instead  of  heavy,  main-
tenance-intensive hydraulics systems to control an airplane’s rudder and wing flaps;
flight management systems such as the ‘‘black boxes’’ that continuously monitor an
aircraft’s engines, speed, location, and other critical parameters; and advanced com-
posites  made  out  of  materials  such  as  graphite  and  epoxy  that  can  be  used  to  re-
place heavier and more maintenance-intensive aluminum alloy structures. The Boe-
ing  787,  now  under  development,  will  be  the  first  large  civil  aircraft  to  use  com-
posite materials in its fuselage.
The U.S. Aircraft Industry

The  domestic  aeronautics  industry  has  changed  substantially  over  the  last  ten  to
fifteen  years  through  consolidations.  Today  there  is  only  one  manufacturer  of  large
civil  aircraft,  Boeing,  and  just  two  turbine  engine  manufacturers  for  large  civil  air-
craft,  General  Electric  and  Pratt  &  Whitney.  The  U.S.  has  no  domestic  regional  jet
manufacturers, the fastest growing segment in civil aviation; most are made in Can-
ada and Brazil. The business jet and general aviation aircraft industry has a much
larger number of producers.

Boeing  is  this  country’s  largest  exporter  of  manufactured  products  (based  on  dol-
lar  value),  and  there  are  thousands  of  suppliers  whose  products  are  found  in  each
jet.  Airbus,1 a  European  company  and  Boeing’s  only  rival,  has  overtaken  Boeing  in
terms  of  winning  new  aircraft  orders.  Parenthetically,  earlier  this  year  Airbus  un-
veiled  its  new  A380  aircraft,  a  ‘‘super  jumbo’’  that  will  be  the  world’s  largest  pas-
senger-carrying  aircraft  (it  can  seat  over  800  in  a  single-class  layout).  The  A380’s
first flight is scheduled for later this spring.

Earlier  this  decade,  the  European  Union  (EU)  identified  aeronautics  as  part  of  a
continent-wide industrial strategy. The EU produced a research program document,
‘‘Aeronautics  2020,’’  that  explicitly  states  its  objective  of  becoming  the  world’s  lead-
ing supplier of aeronautics goods and services and achieving parity with Boeing. Ar-
guably,  it  has  met  its  goal.  The  EU  also  has  set  a  goal  of  taking  a  leadership  role
in  developing  the  design  and  production  of  next  generation  air  traffic  management
services.

1 Airbus began over 30 years ago as a government-created and owned entity with direct invest-
ment  by  the  British,  French,  Spanish,  and  German  governments.  It  has  since  been  spun  off  as
a private company owned by EADS and BAE systems, both European based conglomerates.

An Assessment of NASA’s Aeronautics Technology Programs

NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (2004)

Excerpts from the Executive Summary

The  National  Research  Council  Committee  and  its  three  subordinate  panels  con-
ducted an independent peer assessment of the Vehicle Systems Program (VSP), the
Airspace  Systems  Program  (ASP),  and  the  Aviation  safety  Program  (AvSP),  the
three  elements  of  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Technology  Programs.  NASA  specifically
asked the Committee and panels to address four questions:

1. Is the array of activities about right?
2. Is there a good plan to carry out the program?
3. Is the program doing what it set out to do?
4. Is the entire effort connected to the users?

The  Committee’s  simple  answer  to  the  four  questions  posed  by  NASA  is  that,  in
general,  the  Aeronautics  Technology  Programs  are  very  good  but  could  be  greatly
improved by following the Committee’s 12 top-level recommendations.
Top-Level Recommendations:

1. The  government  should  continue  to  support  air  transportation,  which  is

vital to the U.S. economy and the well-being of its citizens.

2. NASA should provide world leadership in aeronautics research and develop-

ment.

3. NASA  has  many  excellent  technical  personnel  and  facilities  to  achieve  its
aeronautics  technology  objectives  but  should  improve  its  processes  for  pro-
gram management.

4. NASA  should  eliminate  arbitrary  time  constraints  on  program  completion
and  schedule  key  milestones  based  on  task  complexity  and  technology  ma-
turity.

5. NASA should reduce the number of tasks in its aeronautics technology port-

folio.

6. NASA should pursue more high-risk, high-payoff technologies.
7. NASA  should  reconstitute  a  long-term  base  research  program,  separate

from the other aeronautics technology programs and projects.

8. NASA’s  aeronautics  technology  infrastructure  exceeds  its  current  needs,
and  the  Agency  should  continue  to  dispose  of  under-utilized  assets  and  fa-
cilities.

9. NASA  should  implement  full-cost  accounting  in  a  way  that  avoids  unin-
tended  consequences  harmful  to  the  long-term  health  of  the  aeronautics
program.

10. NASA  should  develop  a  common  understanding  with  the  Federal  Aviation

Administration (FAA) of their respective roles and relationship.

11. NASA should seek better feedback from senior management in industry and

other government organizations.

12. NASA should conduct research in selective areas relevant to rotorcraft.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Good  morning.  I  am  here  to  call  this  meet-
ing  of  the  Space  and  Aeronautics  Subcommittee  to  order.  Without
objection,  the  Chair  will  be  granted  the  authority  to  recess  the
Committee at any time. Hearing no objection, so ordered.

Today,  we  are  kicking  off  my  first  hearing  as  Chairman  of  the
Space  and  Aeronautics  Subcommittee.  We  are  beginning  our  over-
sight of the fiscal year 2006 NASA budget, and we will focus today
on the aeronautics research and development program.

There are a number of areas that I would like for us to examine
through  the  hearing  this  year,  including  the  Shuttle’s  return-to-
flight, issues with the NASA workforce and infrastructure, NASA’s
financial  management  system,  and  issues  concerning  our  commer-
cial space industry. Just as important, I want to ensure that we get
back to work on the authorization bill for NASA.

This is a critical time for the Agency, with a whole host of issues
on  its  plate.  It  is  important  that  the  Congress  offer  guidance  for
the  big  decision  facing  NASA  in  the  near  future.  I  want  to  com-
mend  the  President  and  his  superb  choice  of  Mike  Griffin  as  the
next  NASA  Administrator.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  him,
once he is confirmed, to begin addressing these issues.

Today, we will begin our oversight of the fiscal year 2006 budget
proposed  for  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  and  development  pro-
gram.  The  Europeans  have  thrown  down  the  gauntlet,  and  said
they  will  dominate  aerospace  in  the  world  by  2020.  The  U.S.  aero-
space  industry  has  expressed  alarm  at  the  reductions  of  NASA’s
aeronautics investment, pointing out that aerospace products are a
huge  source  of  export  sales,  and  a  major  contributor  to  the  United
States international balance of trade.

Our  nation’s  preeminence  in  commercial  aircraft  is  being  seri-
ously  challenged  by  Airbus,  and  many  believe  that  reduced  aero-
nautics R&D funding has directly played a role in the cause of the
weakened  position  and  the  weakened  aerospace  industry.  There  is
a  lot  of  concern  that  the  investment  in  aeronautics  research  and
development  by  this  nation  has  been  limping  along  for  several
years, and there is a lack of a national strategy. Over the next five
years,  NASA  is  proposing  to  reduce  its  aeronautics  workforce  by
approximately 2,000 people, and to shut down a number of its wind
tunnels.

The  questions  that  I  have  are,  are  these  wise  decisions  for  the
Nation?  Should  NASA  develop  a  national  strategy  for  aeronautics
before  these  valuable  assets  and  skills  are  lost?  Does  NASA  have
a  human  capital  strategy,  or  are  these  personnel  cuts  solely  for
budget  purposes?  Do  we  have  a  national  strategy  for  civil  aero-
nautics  R&D,  and  if  so,  is  NASA  aligned  to  support  a  national
strategy?

The current requested funding levels for the aeronautics program
amount  to  a  little  over  five  percent  of  NASA’s  overall  budget.  The
funding trend is declining at a rather precarious rate over the next
several years. I am hoping that today’s witnesses are able to guide
the Subcommittee in addressing what this nation’s aeronautics pri-
orities  should  be,  and  how  NASA  should  address  these  priorities.
In  fiscal  year  2006  budget  request,  NASA  offers  three  programs
in aeronautics R&D area. Of the three, Airspace Systems and Avia-
tion  and  Security  are  funded  at  a  flat  level,  and  Vehicle  Systems

received  a  20  percent  cut,  approximately  $100  million.  This  does
not  appear  to  bode  well  for  the  Nation  investment  in  the  future  of
the aerospace industry and our nation’s competitiveness.

I look forward from hearing from our witnesses today on this im-
portant topic. I also want to welcome Mr. Udall in his new capacity
as  the  Ranking  Member  on  this  subcommittee.  I  look  forward  to
working  with  you  and  this  Congress.  We  have  worked  together  on
other  committees,  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  on  this
committee.  In  fact,  I  think  we  are  on  all  the  same  committees,
come to think of it. Yeah.

So, at this point, I would like to recognize Mr. Udall for his open-

ing statement.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Calvert follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN KEN CALVERT

Today,  we  are  kicking  off  my  first  hearing  as  Chairman  for  the  Space  and  Aero-
nautics Subcommittee. We are beginning our oversight of the FY 2006 NASA budget
and  will  focus  today  on  the  Aeronautics  research  and  development  program.  There
are  a  number  of  areas  that  I  would  like  for  us  to  examine  through  hearings  this
year, including: the Shuttle’s Return-to-Flight; issues with the NASA workforce and
infrastructure;  NASA’s  financial  management  system;  and  issues  concerning  our
nascent commercial space industry.

Just as important, I want to ensure that we get to work on the authorization bill
for  NASA.  This  is  a  critical  time  for  the  Agency  with  a  whole  host  of  issues  on  its
plate.  It  is  important  that  the  Congress  offer  guidance  for  the  big  decisions  facing
NASA in the near future.

I want to commend the President in his superb choice of Mike Griffin as the next
NASA Administrator and I look forward to working with him once he is confirmed,
to begin addressing these issues.

Today,  we  will  begin  our  oversight  of  the  FY  2006  budget  proposed  for  NASA’s
Aeronautics  research  and  development  program.  The  Europeans  have  thrown  down
the  gauntlet  and  said  that  they  will  dominate  aerospace  in  the  world  by  the  year
2020. The U.S. aerospace industry has expressed alarm at the reductions in NASA’s
aeronautics  investment,  pointing  out  that  aerospace  products  are  a  huge  source  of
export  sales  and  a  major  contributor  to  the  United  States’  international  balance  of
trade. Our nation’s preeminence in commercial aircraft is being seriously challenged
by  Airbus  and  many  believe  that  reduced  aeronautics  R&D  funding  has  directly
played  a  role  in  the  cause  of  this  weakened  position  of  the  American  aerospace  in-
dustry.

There is a lot of concern that the investment in aeronautics research and develop-
ment  by  this  nation  has  been  limping  along  for  several  years,  and  that  there  is  a
lack  of  a  national  strategy.  Over  the  next  five  years,  NASA  is  proposing  to  reduce
its aeronautics workforce by approximately 2,000 people and to shut down a number
of its wind tunnels. The questions that I have are: Are these wise decisions for our
nation? Should NASA develop a national strategy for aeronautics before these valu-
able  assets  and  skills  are  lost?  Does  NASA  have  a  Human  Capital  Strategy  or  are
these personnel cuts solely for budget purposes? Should we have a national strategy
for  civil  aeronautics  R&D?  If  so,  is  NASA  aligned  to  support  a  national  strategy?
The  current  requested  funding  levels  for  the  Aeronautics  programs  amount  to  a
little  over  five  percent  of  NASA’s  overall  budget.  The  funding  trend  is  declining  at
a  rather  precarious  rate  over  the  next  several  years.  I  am  hoping  that  today’s  wit-
nesses  are  able  to  offer  guidance  to  this  subcommittee  in  addressing  what  this  na-
tion’s  aeronautics  priorities  should  be  and  how  NASA  should  address  these  prior-
ities.  In  the  FY  2006  budget  request,  NASA  offers  three  programs  in  the  Aero-
nautics  R&D  area.  Of  the  three,  Airspace  Systems  and  Aviation  Safety  &  Security
are  funded  at  a  flat  level  and  Vehicle  Systems  received  a  20  percent  cut  (-$100M).
This  does  not  appear  to  bode  well  for  our  nation’s  investment  in  the  future  of  the
aerospace industry and our nation’s competitiveness.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  today  on  this  very  important  topic.
Mr.  UDALL.  I  thank  the  Chairman.  Good  morning  to  everybody

here.

I  would  like  to  join  the  Chairman  in  welcoming  our  witnesses,
the first panel in particular, Representative Jo Ann Davis and Rep-
resentative Dennis Kucinich, who I am sure will join us.

I  would  also  like  to  take  the  opportunity  to  say  how  much  I  am
looking  forward  to  working  with  Chairman  Calvert  and  the  other
Members  of  this  subcommittee.  We  have  a  lot  of  important  issues
to  deal  with  over  the  next  two  years,  and  I  am  confident  that  we
will be able to work effectively across party lines to do the Nation’s
business.

One  of  the  important  issues  that  we  need  to  address  is  topic  of
this  morning’s  hearing,  namely,  the  future  of  NASA’s  aeronautics
program.  This  year  marks  the  90th  anniversary  of  the  establish-
ment  of  the  National  Advisory  Committee  for  Aeronautics,  NACA,
as it was known, the organization predecessor of NASA. During its
existence,  NACA  undertook  much  of  the  R&D  that  made  modern
commercial and military aviation possible.

Congress recognized the value of federally sponsored R&D in aer-
onautics,  and  made  it  one  of  NASA’s  core  missions  when  it  estab-
lished  the  Agency  in  1958.  It  made  good  sense  then,  and  it  makes
good  sense  now  to  have  NASA  involved  in  aeronautical  R&D.
NASA’s  R&D  in  aeronautics  and  aviation  benefits  not  only—helps
our international competitiveness, but also the quality of life of our
citizens.  Research  on  ways  to  drastically  reduce  aircraft  noise  and
emissions,  research  into  safer  and  more  secure  aircraft,  research
into new vehicle concepts that could revolutionize future air travel,
and  research  into  ways  to  modernize  the  Nation’s  air  traffic  man-
agement system, so that we don’t face gridlock in the skies at some
point  in  the  coming  decades.  All  of  these  are  areas  of  research
NASA has been pursuing.

Yet  despite  the  clear  value  of  such  research,  NASA  aeronautics
program  has  now  reached  a  crisis  point.  Coming  in  the  wake  of
years  of  declining  budgets,  the  fiscal  year  2006  request,  if  ap-
proved,  would  further  erode  the  aeronautics  program’s  capabilities
over the next five years. In addition to the low priority being given
to  aeronautics  in  the  budget,  NASA’s  experiment  with  full  cost  re-
covery,  an  approach  that  DOD  has  tried  and  abandoned,  has  jeop-
ardized the continued viability of an important segment of the Na-
tion’s aeronautical test facilities.

Moreover,  while  it  has  been  difficult  to  get  definitive  answers
concerning  NASA’s  intentions  for  the  workforce  at  the  Aeronautics
Research Centers, it is clear that NASA management envisions sig-
nificant numbers of current employees leaving the program. As one
of  our  witnesses,  Dr.  Hansman,  observes  in  his  testimony,  the
workforce actions appear to be motivated by budget pressures rath-
er than strategic efforts at intellectual renewal. This, coupled with
a perception of declining NASA priority in aeronautics, could create
an  atmosphere  where  it  is  difficult  to  retain  and  attract  the  best
and the brightest.

All  of  this  troubles  me.  We  seem  to  be  headed  down  a  path  that
could  result  in  the  loss  of  a  vital  national  capability  if  we  aren’t
careful.  The  NASA  witness  at  today’s  hearing  will  have  the  some-
what  thankless  task  of  trying  to  convince  us  that  things  aren’t  so
bad,  even  though  his  programs  are  being  cut  year  after  year.  In
that regard, I bring an open mind to the hearing, and I am willing

to  be  convinced  that  the  ’06  budget  request  for  aeronautics  is
healthy.

But  in  order  to  be  convinced,  I  am  first  going  to  need  to  have  a
number of concerns addressed. For example, NASA’s ’06 budget re-
quest  focuses  the  Vehicle  Systems  funding  on  research  into  break-
through  technologies,  with  the  intent  of  achieving  near-term  flight
demonstrations  of  revolutionary  and  barrier-breaking  technology.
That  sounds  good.  However,  flight  demonstrations  tend  to  be  the
most expensive part of the aeronautical R&D process. Yet, NASA’s
budget plan indicates that the Vehicle Systems budget will decline
by  43  percent  over  the  next  five  years.  That  doesn’t  strike  me  as
a credible approach.

I  could  cite  other  examples,  but  I  want  to  bring  my  remarks  to
a close, so we can hear from our witnesses. I would simply conclude
by  saying  that  I  think  we  really  have  a  straightforward  question
of  priorities  before  us.  The  bleak  outlook  for  aeronautics  at  NASA
is  not  an  inevitability.  It  is  a  result  of  policy  decisions  and
prioritizations that Congress may or may not choose to endorse.

Mr. Chairman, as I close, I would like to ask unanimous consent
that  the  written  testimony  submitted  by  Mr.  Gregory  Junemann,
of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engi-
neers, be entered into the record.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GREGORY J. JUNEMANN

PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF PROFESSIONAL & TECHNICAL

ENGINEERS, AFL–CIO & CLC

Summary:

The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, which rep-
resents more than 8,000 employees at five NASA Centers, is concerned that the dra-
matic cuts in NASA’s aeronautical R&D proposed in the FY06 budget, together with
the associated ill-conceived draconian workforce downsizing, will harm NASA’s abil-
ity  to  live  up  to  its  responsibility  to  bolster  U.S.  global  leadership  in  aeronautics,
to  its  duty  to  maintain  the  safety  and  security  of  the  air-traveling  public,  and  to
its  obligation  to  help  fuel  U.S.  economic  growth  and  prosperity.  We  propose  a  few
specific legislative solutions, appropriate for the FY06 Authorization bill, as well as
an  alternate  revenue-neutral  funding  path  better  suited  for  delivering  the  Presi-
dent’s Exploration Vision while maintaining NASA’s intellectual assets and facilities
necessary to meet America’s critical future needs in aeronautics.
Statement:

The  International  Federation  of  Professional  and  Technical  Engineers  would  like
to  thank  Chairmen  Boehlert  and  Calvert  as  well  as  Ranking  Members  Gordon  and
Udall for according us the privilege of submitting this testimony for the record. The
Nation  is  looking  to  the  House  Science  Committee  and  its  Subcommittee  on  Space
and  Aeronautics  to  scrutinize  carefully  NASA’s  proposed  FY06  budget  and  associ-
ated  activities.  In  particular,  in  the  context  of  today’s  hearing  on  the  future  of
NASA’s aeronautics programs, we ask that the Committee compel NASA to explain
exactly  how  it  expects  to  meet  its  responsibility  to  foster  progress  in  aviation  for
the  American  people  while  imposing  a  nearly  one-third  cut  in  funding  to  the  Aero-
nautics Research Mission Directorate. What increased risks are the American people
being  asked  to  accept?  What  constraints  on  economic  growth?  What  loss  in  world
leadership and national prestige?

NASA  aeronautical  R&D  has  an  unquestioned  track  record  of  return  on  invest-
ment  and,  at  less  than  $1billion  dollars  annually,  is  an  amazing  bargain;  it  con-
tinues  to  play  a  crucial  role  in  the  near  flawless  safety  record  in  U.S.  commercial
aviation and in technology innovation for both civilian and military aeronautics. Un-
fortunately  however,  NASA  aeronautics  funds  are  being  improperly  pilfered  to  sup-
port  a  chaotic  and  hastily  planned  increase  in  the  Exploration  budget.  The  Presi-
dent’s Vision for Space Exploration contains a budget chart (p. 19) showing a small

short-term  decrease  in  aeronautical  R&D  of  a  magnitude  far  less  than  the  one  cur-
rently proposed, and the long-term costs of Exploration covered by the phase-out of
funding  to  the  Shuttle  and  ISS  programs.  NASA  must  explain  to  Congress  and  to
the  American  people  such  a  divergence  from  the  President’s  initial  plan,  and  why
Aeronautics  is  being  sacrificed  for  Exploration  when  the  Vision  clearly  intended  to
use ISS and Shuttle funds for that purpose.

Much  of  the  science  and  many  of  the  currently  implemented  technologies  and  fa-
cilities  funded  by  the  Aeronautics  budget  have  significant  impacts  on  past  space
missions,  and  leveraging  these  existing  assets  and  expertise  will  prove  invaluable
in  any  cost-effective  yet  accelerated  Exploration  plan.  The  proposed  cutbacks  jeop-
ardize  facilities,  scientists,  engineers,  and  technicians  that  should  be  available,  for
example,  to  test  vehicle  design  and  human-system  integration  for  a  Mars  mission
Entry,  Descent  and  Landing,  and  to  design  airborne  ‘‘flyers’’  for  Mars  surveying,  to
name  just  two.  The  proposed  cuts  in  aeronautical  R&D  will  have  unintended  con-
sequences for Exploration in the out-years; such impacts must be evaluated and pre-
vented before the damage is done.

Additionally,  in  NASA’s  Aeronautics  blueprint  (February,  2002),  the  Agency  out-
lines  a  clear  plan  for  NASA’s  aeronautical  R&D  as  critical  component  of  a  bold  vi-
sion  of  the  future  of  America’s  civil  and  military  aviation.  This  document  states
some simple facts:

1. Aviation  is  crucial  to  U.S.  economic  health,  national  security,  and  overall

quality of life.

2. The Nation is facing continuing serious challenges in aviation.
3. New technologies are needed to create a new level of performance and capa-

bility.

These facts remain as true today as they were when Administrator O’Keefe signed
off  on  the  blueprint  three  years  ago.  Indeed,  this  view  has  been  reasserted  and  ex-
tended by the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO)—an interagency task
force  created  in  2003  under  the  Century  of  Aviation  Reauthorization  Act  and
charged  with  coordinating  aeronautics  efforts  across  NASA,  FAA,  DOD,  Commerce,
Transportation,  and  Homeland  Security  to  ‘‘ensure  that  the  Next  Generation  Air
Transportation System meets air transportation safety, security, mobility, efficiency,
and capacity needs.’’ In their Integrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air
Transportation  System  (December  2004),  the  JPDO  lays  out  an  urgent  agenda  to:

1. Retain U.S. Leadership in Global Aviation
2. Expand Capacity
3. Ensure Safety
4. Protect the Environment
5. Ensure Our National Defense
6. Secure the Nation

Clearly,  NASA  must  play  a  prominent  role  in  all  six  of  these  efforts  (as  it  is  the
only  Agency  with  the  appropriate  broad-based  aeronautical  R&D  expertise  and  ex-
perience)  and  any  reprogramming  of  NASA’s  aeronautical  R&D  programs  must  be
evaluated  to  assure  that  cuts  do  not  jeopardize  the  swift  and  effective  implementa-
tion of this coordinated effort.

Just  as  clearly,  industry  and  academia  alone  will  not  meet  the  Nation’s  needs  in
aeronautics.  It  is  an  inherently  governmental  responsibility  to  drive  the  long-term
R&D needed to create the revolutionary (and, hence, risky and unprofitable even in
the  medium-term)  changes  needed  for  aviation  in  the  21st  century.  The  profit  mo-
tive  will  back  the  status  quo  until  market  conditions  change  so  dramatically  (e.g.,
the doubling of the number of commercial flights) that the status quo no longer func-
tions  safely  and  efficiently.  Yet,  revolutionary  technology  change  does  not  occur
overnight  and  hence  the  Nation  can  ill  afford  to  wait  until  market  forces  can  drive
change, i.e., we cannot wait to act until planes are crashing because of an overbur-
dened airspace system. Investing in NASA aeronautical R&D will bolster America’s
leadership  in  aeronautics  as  well  as  both  our  military  might  and  our  civilian  com-
petitiveness in aircraft design, production, and operations.

NASA also plays a unique role in responding to the Nation’s need to develop and
maintain critical, unique, and—yes—unprofitable test facilities; as well as the need
for the independent, scientifically-based establishment of evolving standards for de-
sign  requirements  and  safety  certification.  NASA  plays  a  critical  role  in  supporting
the  efforts  of  its  sister  aeronautics-related  Agencies:  the  Federal  Aviation  Adminis-
tration  (FAA)  and  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  (NTSB).  Using  its  fa-
cilities  and  in-house  expertise,  NASA  assists  the  FAA  establish  and  introduce  new

18

safety  standards  and  new  operational  capabilities  and  helps  the  NTSB  identify  the
root causes of accidents. These key roles provide further justification for continuing
a  major  governmental  role  in  America’s  aeronautical  R&D.  Only  NASA  has  the  ex-
pertise,  capability,  and  independence  to  perform  this  role  properly  and  effectively
without being compromised by external profit motives.

In  a  recent  thorough  external  review  of  NASA’s  aeronautics  program  conducted
by  the  National  Research  Council  (NRC  Review  of  NASA’s  Aerospace  Technology
Enterprise:  An  Assessment  of  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Technology  Programs,  2004),  a
panel  of  experts  throughout  the  aeronautics  industry  and  academia  issued  a  dozen
top-level  recommendations.  Among  these,  the  first  two  are:  ‘‘(t)he  government
should  continue  to  support  air  transportation,  which  is  vital  to  the  U.S.  economy
and the well being of its citizens, and NASA should provide world leadership in aer-
onautics  research  and  development.’’  That  said,  in  its  third  recommendation,  the
NRC gave NASA’s rank-and-file employees a ringing endorsement while warning of
problems  with  NASA  management:  ‘‘NASA  has  many  excellent  technical  personnel
and facilities to achieve its aeronautics technology objectives, but should improve its
processes  for  program  management.’’  A  large  part  of  this  management  problem  is
the  exploding  population  of  technically-detached  managers  created  by  NASA  man-
agement’s  inefficient  matrixed  structure  and  its  insistence  on  excessive  internal  re-
porting,  a  permanent  state  of  re-organization,  and  other  unproductive,  non-tech-
nical, and overall inefficient activities.

A  full  evaluation  of  all  the  NRC  recommendations  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this
statement,  but  it  is  important  to  note  that  another  important  recommendation  was
that  ‘‘NASA  should  reconstitute  a  long-term  base  research  program,  separate  from
the other aeronautics technology programs and projects.’’ It is troubling that NASA
management has rejected this recommendation and has turned instead in the oppo-
site direction by implementing a demonstration project approach to its aeronautical
R&D.

The NASA blueprint concludes with the blunt statement that ‘‘the cost of inaction
is gridlock, constrained mobility, unrealized economic growth, and loss of U.S. avia-
tion  leadership.’’  This  must  not  be  allowed  to  occur.  NASA  can  continue  to  realign
itself towards the President’s Exploration Vision, but it must and can do so without
dramatically  reducing  its  aeronautical  R&D  capabilities.  NASA  management’s  plan
to siphon off 30 percent of its aeronautics funds to support the Exploration Systems
Mission Directorate (ESMD) will prevent NASA from living up to the promise of its
own  blueprint,  to  its  responsibility  in  the  JPDO’s  Next  Generation  Air  Transpor-
tation  Integrated  Plan,  to  its  duty  to  maintain  the  safety  and  security  of  the  air-
traveling  public,  and  to  its  obligation  to  help  fuel  U.S.  economic  growth  and  pros-
perity.
The  devastating  impact  of  the  FY06  budget  on  the  Aeronautics  Field  Cen-

ters

NASA’s FY06 budget proposal contemplates an overall 30 percent decrease in the
aeronautics budget between FY05 and FY07. The immediate FY06 cuts focus nearly
completely on redirecting the Vehicle Systems Program (VSP), despite the fact that
the  NRC  review  stated  that  ‘‘(t)he  committee  evaluated  a  total  of  172  tasks  in  the
VSP  portfolio.  The  committee  determined  that  more  than  80  percent  were  of  good
quality  or  better,  with  30  percent  (51  tasks)  rated  as  world-class.’’  One  has  to  won-
der what will happen to all that world-class R&D and all those world-class scientists
and engineers given that the proposed cuts far exceed the 20 percent that one might
expect  from  the  above  numbers.  However,  even  more  troubling  is  the  fact  that,  al-
though  the  remaining  programs  (Airspace  Systems,  Aviation  Safety  and  Security)
appear  stable  in  the  overall  FY06  budget  projections,  the  current  and  projected
funding  picture  is  far  different  at  all  of  the  aeronautics  performing  Field  Centers.
From  the  data  in  Associate  Administrator  Lebacqz’s  February  16th  briefing  to
committee  staffers,  one  can  generate  the  following  clear  picture  of  the  magnitude
of the impacts of the FY06 budget across all three Aeronautics Field Centers. (Simi-
lar  impacts  are  evident  at  Ames  Research  Center  but,  because  it  is  no  longer  an
official Aeronautics Center, its detailed numbers were not available in his briefing.)

19

The elimination over this 18-month period of more than a third of a Field Center’s
highly skilled and experienced technical aeronautics workforce would seem a bit im-
prudent, as well as contrary to NASA’s own blueprint, the JPDO’s Integrated Plan,
and  the  NRC’s  recent  NASA  recommendations.  The  above  numbers  also  do  not  ad-
dress the adverse impacts on critical facilities (see below).
Legislative Proposals

IFPTE asks that the House Science Committee exercise its oversight authority by
adding the following language into its FY06 Authorization bill to safeguard NASA’s
aeronautics capabilities:

1. NASA  shall  reserve  at  least  six  percent  of  its  FY06  budget  for  the  Aero-
nautical  R&D  activities  and  plan  for  seven  percent  in  the  FY07  rising  to  10
percent  in  out-year  budgets.  Among  other  things,  NASA  shall  use  this  in-
crease  in  funding  to  implement  the  NRC  review  panel’s  recommendation  to
‘‘reconstitute  a  long-term  base  research  program,  separate  from  the  other
aeronautics technology programs and projects.’’

2. NASA  shall  decrease  its  management  workforce  (supervisors  and  manage-
ment officials) by a third in FY06 and plan to reduce this workforce by a fac-
tor  of  two  from  the  FY05  baseline  by  the  end  of  FY07.  NASA  shall  not  de-
crease  its  technical  workforce  at  any  Field  Center  by  more  than  10  percent
in  any  given  year  and  shall  explicitly  include  any  planned  technical  work-
force reductions of any kind in its annual Workforce Plan submitted to Con-
gress.

An Alternate Approach to Funding the Exploration Vision and Aeronautics
The  modest  numbers  in  Proposal  1  will  provide  the  Associate  Administrator  Dr.
Lebacqz (or his successor) with adequate funding to preserve NASA’s critical facility
infrastructure  and  intellectual  capital  at  Ames  Research  Center,  Dryden  Flight  Re-
search  Center,  Glenn  Research  Center,  and  Langley  Research  Center,  and  to  en-
hance  their  ability  to  deliver  to  the  American  people  what  they  need  and  expect
from NASA—scientific discoveries and technology/operational breakthroughs.

Proposal  2  will  not  only  allow  NASA  to  re-vector  internal  funds  for  Exploration,
Science,  and  Aeronautics  R&D,  it  will  put  NASA  more  in  line  with  the  rest  of  the
high-tech world as far as its management to technical employee ratio. Currently, the
number  of  scientists  and  engineers  across  NASA  for  every  non-clerical  administra-
tive  employee  is  typically  two  to  three,  and  this  ratio  does  not  even  include  cor-
porate  overhead  from  NASA  HQ  management.  Our  proposal  will  go  a  long  way  to-
wards  making  this  overhead  ratio  closer  to  a  healthy  1:8,  typical  of  private  enter-
prise.

To generate the additional needed revenue to enable our first legislative proposal
above  and  NASA’s  realignment  toward  the  President’s  Exploration  Vision,  NASA
should  seriously  consider  reducing  its  role  in  completing  the  International  Space
Station  (ISS).  Administrator-nominee  Dr.  Griffin  noted  in  his  October  2003  testi-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:40 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 020007 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\031605\20007 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

20

mony  to  the  House  Science  Committee  that  ‘‘in  a  human  space  flight  program  fo-
cused  on  ‘settling  the  solar  system,’  construction  of  a  LEO  (low-Earth  orbit)  space
station would not be an early priority.’’ Furthermore, he states wisely that ‘‘we must
not  mortgage  our  future  to  ISS.’’  We  concur  and  ask  that  NASA  funding  decisions
reflect this reality. Reducing NASA’s ISS commitments would also allow it to make
a  better  effort  to  meet  its  requirement  not  to  exceed  the  cost  ceiling  of  $25  billion
in the NASA Authorization Act of 2000.

In  this  vein,  NASA  should  admit  now  that  it  cannot  conduct  an  additional  28
Shuttle flights before the end of 2010 and act accordingly. Significantly reducing the
number  of  Shuttle  flights  would  free  up  billions  of  dollars.  NASA  needs  to  wean
itself  as  soon  as  possible  of  its  dependence  on  the  Shuttle,  an  intrinsically  risky
transportation  system,  and  on  Russian  capabilities,  a  national  security  nightmare
and  a  looming  treaty  violation.  As  Dr.  Griffin  stated  to  the  House  Science  Com-
mittee,  ‘‘(r)egarding  the  Space  Shuttle,  . . .we  should  move  to  replace  this  system
with all deliberate speed. . .we must admit to ourselves that it is time to move on.’’
NASA  should  focus  a  smaller  number  of  remaining  Shuttle  flights  to  address  core
needs of the President’s Vision: research on the impact of space flight on physiology
and  performance,  and  a  manned  Hubble  repair  mission.  The  released  funds  can
then  be  redirected  primarily  for  enhanced  support  of  the  development  of  the  Crew
Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and secondarily for enhanced support of Science and Aer-
onautics.  This  general  scenario  also  puts  these  three  core  NASA  efforts  in  a  better
position should Congress decide that it must cut NASA’s overall budget in FY06 or
later.

This alternate approach:

1. will expedite the Nation’s real solution to its current space-related problems
by  reinforcing  the  development  of  new,  safer,  more  flexible  space  transpor-
tation  systems  without  consuming  critical  long-term  R&D  funds  to  meet
near-term milestones;

2. will dramatically reduce the risk of another catastrophic failure of the Shut-

tle with its associated loss of life and national treasure;

3. will minimize U.S. dependence on Soyuz;
4. will  minimize  ISS  cost  overruns  and  NASA’s  need  to  extend  ISS’s  cost  ceil-

ing.

The  downside  will  be  that  this  approach  may  harm  NASA’s  relationship  with  its
international  partners.  Of  course,  as  Dr.  Griffin  stated  with  regard  to  ISS,  ‘‘we
should  do  what  is  necessary  to  bring  the  program  to  an  orderly  completion  while
respecting our international partnership agreements.’’ IFPTE concurs that we must
respect  our  international  partners  and  must  handle  any  reduced  U.S.  involvement
in  ISS  diplomatically,  however  this  respect  cannot  be  allowed  to  supersede  NASA’s
duty  to  protect  the  American  taxpayer,  to  fulfill  the  President’s  Exploration  Vision,
and  to  defend  the  safety  and  security  of  the  air-traveling  public.  Given  that  NASA
has proposed only a tiny increase in funding associated with the Exploration Vision
and that Congress appears poised to reduce this increase, Congress should heed Dr.
Griffin’s  warning  that  ‘‘(i)f  no  additional  funding  can  be  made  available,  it  will  be
very  difficult  to  complete  ISS  and,  at  the  same  time,  embark  on  the  development
of  those  other  systems  that  are  required  for  a  truly  valuable  and  exciting  human
space flight program.’’

IFPTE’s  legislative  proposals  above  and  the  associated  proposal  to  de-scope
NASA’s  ISS  commitments  and  to  accelerate  the  retirement  of  Shuttle  are  suffi-
ciently generic to allow NASA management considerable flexibility. They are meant
to foster a serious discussion about the future of NASA and to propose an alternate
path  that  allows  NASA  to  better  meet  the  challenge  of  the  President’s  Exploration
Vision without cannibalizing the other critical functions of the Agency.
Critical National Needs Impacted by NASA Aeronautics Cuts

The Nation is facing key aviation challenges: increasing capacity while maintain-
ing  or  enhancing  safety,  reducing  noise  and  emissions,  establishing  effective  post-
911 security, and holding off the serious challenge by Europe of the U.S. global lead-
ership in aeronautics. Although the private sector will play an important role in ad-
dressing these challenges, as Mr. O’Keefe’s aeronautics blueprint (p. 14) states ‘‘the
need  for  a  continuing  government  role  in  aeronautical  R&T  in  support  of  civilian
and military objectives is as strong today as ever’’ and that NASA’s role is ‘‘strategic
forward-looking breakthrough research combined with tactical problem resolution in
response  to  priorities  established  through  close  partnerships  (with  aviation  product
developers and process owners).’’

A  complete  evaluation  of  the  programmatic  impacts  of  NASA’s  proposed  FY06
budget  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  statement.  IPFTE  urges  the  Committee  to  ask
the  Center  Directors  at  each  of  the  adversely  affected  Centers  (Ames,  Dryden,
Glenn,  Langley)  to  provide  a  report  to  them  describing  the  impacts  of  the  FY06
budget  plan  on  their  R&D  activities,  their  facilities,  and  their  contractor  and  Civil
Service  workforce.  There  is  much  more  happening  on  the  ground  than  is  being
shown  to  you  in  the  FY06  budget  numbers.  The  Committee  will  need  this  informa-
tion  to  make  an  informed  assessment  of  the  wisdom  of  NASA  FY06  budget  plan.
Some make the argument that current technologies in aeronautics are mature and
therefore  should  be  transferred  to  the  private  sector.  Current  technologies  are  by
definition mature and indeed have been transferred to the private sector. This argu-
ment  is  specious  as  it  is  future  technologies  that  NASA  is  working  on;  these  tech-
nologies are not mature and will require continued incubation in a government lab-
oratory  setting  as  part  of  a  collaborative  effort  between  NASA,  industry,  and  aca-
demia  prior  to  being  ready  for  implementation  in  the  real  world.  As  Associate  Ad-
ministrator Lebacqz pointed out recently, ‘‘there are tremendous breakthroughs still
to  come  in  aeronautics’’  and  ‘‘the  facilities  to  support  those  breakthroughs  or  other
breakthroughs  are  still  required’’  (Aviation  Week  &  Space  Technology,  March  7,
2005).

The critical point is that the Nation needs to go beyond current technologies. The
U.S. once was the world leader in aviation. More civilian airplanes were once made
in  the  U.S.  than  in  the  rest  of  the  world  combined.  Aviation  once  played  a  major
role in the Nation’s trade balance. Now Airbus has a larger share of the global mar-
ket than Boeing. The Europeans know that government support for Airbus is crucial
and this has been a key reason for their success. Now more airplanes are being built
in Canada and Brazil than in the U.S. The U.S. is clearly losing its leadership posi-
tion and our trade deficit continues to grow. Simply redirecting taxpayer dollars di-
rectly to industry is unwise as it may trigger trade sanctions as an improper direct
subsidy.  While  NASA  in-house  R&D  activities  have  a  special  relationship  with
American  aviation  companies  and  preferentially  benefit  American  business,  these
governmental activities do not cross the line imposed by the General Agreement on
Tariff  and  Trade  (GATT).  If  the  U.S.  has  any  chance  of  holding  its  ground,  major
government  investment  in  aeronautical  R&D  is  necessary.  The  U.S.  needs  to  be  as
clever  as  Europe  in  providing  assistance  and  support  for  their  national  industries
without running afoul of the GATT. NASA is poised to lead that effort, representing
the national interest as a whole. The government must take the lead.

Furthermore, even if current vehicle technologies are considered ‘‘mature,’’ human
error  is  still  the  major  cause  of  aviation  accidents.  These  accidents  cost  the  Nation
a  huge  amount  even  when  they  only  happen  in  U.S.  General  Aviation,  or  to  U.S.-
made  aircraft  in  other  countries.  No  single  manufacturer  or  operator  will  address
this problem. It is a national issue, a national responsibility, a national priority. The
government must take the lead.

The recent quiet on the airline safety and security front is misleading. As air traf-
fic  increases  (e.g.,  potential  tripling  of  commercial  flights  over  the  next  20  years,
Unmanned  Airborne  Vehicles,  micro-jets)  and  Air  Traffic  Control  support  dwindles
(e.g.,  synchronized  retirements,  out-dated  equipment),  we  are  going  to  see  greater
delays  and  greater  risks.  Without  sustained  NASA  aeronautical  R&D  funding,
NASA technology innovations will not be there to keep our airline safety record sec-
ond  to  none  and  to  reduce  flight  delays  and  associated  economic  losses.  Although
we  have  not  had  a  major  aviation  security  failure  since  September  11th  2001,  it  is
a complete surety that terrorists will try to strike our aviation system again. With-
out  sustained  NASA  aeronautical  R&D  funding,  NASA  technology  innovations  will
not  be  there  to  help  American  stay  one  step  ahead  of  terrorists.  These  are  serious
national issues that cannot be solved by simplistic solutions such as privatizing ATC
or  limiting  air  traffic.  Aviation  is  a  major  component  of  the  U.S.  economy  and  any
economic  growth  will  depend  on  a  reliable  transportation  system  that  can  scale  up
to  meet  new  economic  demands.  This  challenge  will  not  be  met  by  industry  alone.
The government must take the lead.
Irreparable Harm to Critical Government Assets

Prior to full-cost accounting, any ill-conceived budget cuts one year could be rem-
edied  the  next  by  simply  restoring  the  research  funds.  Unfortunately,  full-cost  ac-
counting  makes  management  blunders  permanent  by  destroying  laboratory  infra-
structure  and  intellectual  capital.  Once  a  facility  is  closed,  it  is  gone.  When  the  ex-

near-term milestones. Inadequate attention is being paid to the big picture and the

long-term  health  of  the  Agency  and  to  its  facilities  and  intellectual  infrastructure.
In  a  few  years,  when  these  very  programs  need  these  same  facilities  they  once
spurned, the facilities will no longer exist and the Nation will need to spend millions
restoring  capabilities  inferior  to  the  ones  we  previously  had.  As  Associate  Adminis-
trator  Lebacqz  warned  recently,  ‘‘if  we  don’t  do  adequate  ground-testing  before  we
go  to  flight  test,  we’ll  make  mistakes’’  (Aviation  Week  &  Space  Technology,  March
7,  2005).  These  mistakes  may  kill  military  pilots  or  civilian  passengers  or  lead  to
millions of dollars in expensive last minute design fixes, so this warning should not
be taken lightly.

The  serious  concern  about  how  NASA  is  implementing  full-cost  accounting  is  not
just  Union  rhetoric;  it  is  shared  by  the  external  industry  and  academic  experts  on
the NRC panel that recently reviewed NASA’s aeronautics programs. One of its top-
level  recommendations  was  that  ‘‘NASA  should  implement  full-cost  accounting  in  a
way  that  avoids  unintended  consequences  harmful  to  the  long-term  health  of  the
aeronautics  program.’’  Especially  given  the  abysmal  failure  of  NASA’s  full-cost  ac-
counting conversion to provide the accounting transparency promised Congress and
the American taxpayer, we ask that Congress to use its authority to investigate this
serious  concern  and  to  compel  NASA  to  modify  those  accounting  policies  and  prac-
tices that are adversely affecting NASA’s ability to get its technical job done for the
American people.

Thank  you  again  for  submitting  these  remarks  into  the  hearing’s  official  record.
Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman for his opening state-
ment.  Without  objection,  the  additional  statements  of  other  Mem-
bers  will  be  put  in  the  written  record,  so  we  can  get  right  to  the
testimony. Hearing no objection, so ordered.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE J. RANDY FORBES

Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing on the proposed FY 2006 budg-
et  for  aeronautics.  This  is  an  issue  of  great  importance  not  only  to  the  Hampton
Roads area of Virginia, but also to our national security and economic security.

In  only  the  last  half  century,  space  exploration  and  scientific  discovery  have
brought  an  unquantifiable  richness  to  human  life.  America’s  space  program  is  a
symbol  of  our  success  as  a  scientifically  and  technologically  advanced  nation.  I  am
pleased that President Bush has devised a plan that seeks to advance human space
exploration, however I am concerned that the FY 2006 Budget proposes cuts to vital
programs that are not related to NASA’s Vision for Space Exploration.

In  particular,  I  remain  concerned  that  reduced  federal  funding  for  aviation  and
aeronautics research and technology in FY 2006 will jeopardize the Nation’s leader-
ship  in  providing  the  technologies  needed  to  develop  the  next  generation  aircraft,
improve  aviation  safety  and  security,  and  attract  the  next  generation  of  aerospace
scientists  and  engineers.  We  are  in  danger  of  falling  behind  our  competitors  in  Eu-
rope  who  have  announced  that  their  goal  is  to  dominate  commercial  aviation  sales
by 2020.

In  addition,  cuts  to  the  NASA  Aeronautics  budget  will  have  a  profound  impact
on the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, which has a long and
proud  history  of  aeronautics  research.  NASA  Langley’s  wind  tunnels  and  labora-
tories,  research  aircraft  and  spacecraft  and  flight  simulators  have  made  significant
contributions  to  our  nation’s  advances  in  the  aeronautics  industry  and  have  the
promise of yielding many more in the future. Like the explorers of the past and the
pioneers of flight in the last century, we cannot identify today all that we will gain
from aviation and aeronautics research; however, we know from experience that the
eventual return will be great. The greater the investments of today, the greater the
rewards for generations to come.

I look forward to hearing from today’s witnesses.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL M. HONDA

Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member Udall, thank you for holding this impor-
tant  hearing  today.  I  believe  it  is  essential  that,  as  NASA  undertakes  a  ‘‘Trans-
formation’’  to  carry  out  the  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  we  remember
that  NASA  stands  for  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  and  ex-
amine what is happening to the aeronautics programs within the Agency.

I  am  very  concerned  about  the  lack  of  Congressional  oversight  of  this  trans-
formation  and  the  fact  that  NASA  has  not  provided  us  with  timely  information
about changes that are taking place, including those being made as we speak to the
aeronautics  programs.  Full  Cost  Accounting  has  been  combined  with  broad  discre-
tionary  authority  granted  to  the  Agency  in  the  Fiscal  Year  2005  Omnibus  Appro-
priations  bill  to  create  a  situation  in  which  the  salaries  of  vast  numbers  of  Civil
Service  R&D  employees  are  being  moved  out  of  project  accounts  and  into  general
operations,  which  has  created  an  artificial  crisis  at  the  centers  and  is  being  used
as  a  reason  to  undertake  large  scale  workforce  reductions.  To  date,  NASA  has  not
provided us with a detailed Operations Plan outlining how these changes are being
made, and NASA has not provided requested documentation outlining those ‘‘excess
competencies’’ broken down by Center, so that it would be possible to see what areas
NASA  management  considered  to  be  no  longer  important  to  pursue.  It  seems  that
aeronautics programs have fallen in this group, with the FY06 Budget Request cut-
ting  aeronautics  programs  over  21  percent  by  FY10,  not  counting  the  loss  in  pur-
chase  power  due  to  inflation.  Although  aeronautics  accounts  for  only  1/17  of  the
NASA  budget,  it  had  to  absorb  close  to  1/3  of  the  total  cut  made  to  the  Agency’s
out-year budget plan.

These decisions seem to fly in the face of a number of recommendations made by
expert  panels.  A  RAND  Corporation  panel  recommended  that  ‘‘of  the  31  existing
major  NASA  test  facilities,  29  constitute  the  ‘minimum  set’  of  facilities  important
to  retain  and  manage  to  serve  national  needs.’’  A  National  Academies  committee
concluded  that  ‘‘although  a  strong  national  program  of  aeronautics  research  and
technology [R&T] may not, by itself, ensure the competitiveness of the U.S. aviation
industry,  the  Committee  agrees  with  earlier  studies  that  without  it,  the  United
States  is  likely  to  become  less  competitive  in  aeronautics  relative  to  countries  with
stronger  programs.  Aviation  is  an  R&T-intensive  industry. . ..  Some  aeronautics
R&T  programs  have  produced  ‘breakthroughs’  that  are  immediately  usable. . ..
More  often,  aeronautics  R&T  advances  are  evolutionary,  and  a  substantial  number
of  years  can  pass  before  the  aviation  systems  making  use  of  these  advances  enter
service.’’  This  last  statement  is  particularly  interesting  in  light  of  the  fact  that
NASA  is  currently  saying  that  it  is  going  to  focus  only  on  ‘‘breakthrough’’  tech-
nologies.

NASA  seems  to  be  following  a  course  on  aeronautics  that  has  potentially  grave
consequences  not  only  for  its  Research  Centers  and  those  who  work  there,  but  also
for  our  nation.  I  have  many  questions  that  I  hope  the  witnesses  can  answer,  and
I look forward to their testimony.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

Chairman Calvert, Ranking Member Udall,

I  want  to  thank  you  for  organizing  this  important  Subcommittee  hearing  to  dis-
cuss The Future of Aeronautics at NASA. I want to welcome our distinguished panel
of  witnesses  to  the  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics.  Being  from  Houston,
I of course take a particular interest in the direction that NASA is taking. The truth
is that any vision for NASA starts today, but will likely affect an entire generation
of humanity in terms of its impact.

A  number  of  our  recent  hearings  in  the  Science  Committee  have  dealt  with  the
national  budget  and  its  impact  on  scientific  research,  development,  and  discovery.
Sadly, the news is almost all bad because this Administration has put out a budget
that  puts  a  squeeze  on  most  of  our  vital  agencies  and  programs.  NASA,  is  not  an
exception  to  this  budget  squeeze.  While  some  would  point  to  the  fact  that  the  total
NASA  budget  of  $16.5  billion  actually  increased  by  1.6  percent,  the  fact  is  that  de-
spite  this  small  increase  many  NASA  programs  have  suffered  deep  cuts  including
vital aeronautics research, which suffered a six percent cut in this latest budget. In
fact,  over  the  last  decade,  funding  for  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  has  declined  by
more  than  half,  to  about  $900  million.  Even  more  troubling  is  that  the  proposed
five-year plan for aeronautics contemplates substantial funding reductions of 20 per-
cent  for  aeronautics  research,  in  addition  with  significant  cutbacks  in  its  civil  serv-
ice and contractor workforces. If our nation expects to stay on the cutting edge and
leads  the  world’s  development  of  new  technologies  it  can  not  afford  to  leave  aero-
nautics research withering on the vine without proper funding.

I am also deeply concerned that the proposed budget cuts will hit NASA’s workers
the  hardest.  Downsizing  the  workforce  may  reduce  the  budget,  but  it  will  not  suc-
ceed  in  moving  NASA  forward.  The  NASA  workers  are  the  heart  and  soul  of  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:40 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 020007 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\031605\20007 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

24

Agency,  the  ones  who  put  the  vision  into  action  and  make  discoveries  happen.  Not
only  do  we  lose  these  talented  individuals  by  reducing  the  workforce,  but  I  am  cer-
tain  that  we  will  scare  away  potential  NASA  recruits.  The  fact  that  workforce  is
being  reduced  is  a  sign  of  instability  and  our  best  and  brightest  minds  may  decide
to  go  another  path  if  they  feel  NASA  does  not  offer  them  the  opportunity  for  real
development.  I  hope  NASA  will  soon  provide  figures  as  to  how  many  facilities  and
workers  they  plan  to  release  and  the  time  frame  for  this  downsizing.  The  uncer-
tainty  that  is  in  the  air  can  not  be  good  for  the  Agency  or  for  the  future  of  our  na-
tion’s aeronautics program.

I  have  been  supportive  of  President  Bush’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  because
I  firmly  believe  that  the  invest  we  make  today  in  science  and  exploration  will  pay
large dividends in the future. Similarly, I do not want to put a cap on the frontiers
of our discovery, NASA should aim high and continue to push our nation at the fore-
front  of  space  exploration  and  scientific  discovery.  However,  I  can  not  see  how  this
is  accomplished  by  cutting  aeronautics  research  and  planning  for  even  deeper  cuts
in  the  future.  The  President  has  stated  that  the  fundamental  goal  of  his  directive
for  the  Nation’s  space  exploration  program  is  ‘‘. . .to  advance  U.S.  scientific,  secu-
rity,  and  economic  interests  through  a  robust  space  exploration  program.’’  I  could
not agree more with that statement; unfortunately, this President’s own budget does
not meet the demands of his ambitious agenda. The United States can not cede our
leadership in the area of aeronautics, especially considering all the practical applica-
tions  it  has  for  millions  of  Americans.  While  other  nations,  notably  in  Europe  are
strengthening  their  work  in  aeronautics  research,  we  seem  to  be  satisfied  to  stay
stagnant and I find that unacceptable.

As  Members  of  this  committee  know  I  have  always  been  a  strong  advocate  for
NASA. My criticism of the President’s budget is intended only to strengthen our ef-
forts  to  move  forward  as  we  always  have  in  the  area  of  space  exploration  and  dis-
covery.  NASA  posses  an  exciting  opportunity  to  charter  a  new  path  that  can  lead
to  untold  discoveries.  As  always  I  look  forward  to  working  with  the  good  men  and
women of NASA as we push the boundaries of our world once again.

Chairman CALVERT. I would like to ask unanimous consent to in-
sert  at  the  appropriate  place  in  the  record  the  background  memo-
randum prepared by the majority staff for this hearing. Hearing no
objection, so ordered.

Today, we will begin our hearing with testimony, beginning with
Congresswoman  Jo  Ann  Davis,  and  I  think  later,  Congressman
Dennis Kucinich will be joining us.

They  will  be  followed  by  the  distinguished  panel  of  experts,  led
by  Dr.  J.  Victor  Lebacqz,  NASA  Associate  Administrator  for  Aero-
nautics. At the table with Mr. Lebacqz will be Dr. John Klineberg,
who led a 2004 Research Council study entitled ‘‘Review of NASA’s
Aerospace  Technology  Enterprise:  An  Assessment  of  NASA’s  Aero-
nautics Technology Program.’’ He is retired as a President of Space
Systems/Loral, and for 25 years, worked at NASA, including as Di-
rector  of  both  the  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  and  the  Ames  Re-
search Center. Dr. Philip Anto´n, who was the principal investigator
of  the  2004  report  produced  by  the  RAND  Corporation  entitled
‘‘Wind  Tunnels  and  Propulsion  Test  Facilities:  An  Assessment  of
NASA’s  Capabilities  to  Serve  the  National  Needs.’’  The  report  was
jointly  sponsored  by  NASA  and  the  Department  of  Defense.  He  is
a  senior  scientist  at  RAND,  which  is  a  federally-funded  research
and  development  center  sponsored  by  the  Department  of  Defense.
And Dr. Mike Benzakein, who was named Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Aerospace Engineering at Ohio State University in October
’04.  From  1967  through  2004,  he  worked  for  GE  Aircraft  Engines,
and  retired  as  general  manager  of  advanced  technology  and  mili-
tary  engineering.  And  finally,  Dr.  John  Hansman,  who  is  the  Pro-
fessor  of  Aeronautics  and  Astronomics  at  the  Massachusetts  Insti-
tute of Technology, and Director of the International Center for Air

Transportation.  His  current  research  interests  focus  on  advanced
cockpit  information  system  and  flight  crew  situational  awareness.
Keep  in  mind,  I  would  like  to  keep  the  testimony,  spoken  testi-
mony,  to  five  minutes.  Any  written  testimony  can  be  made  part  of
the hearing record. Once the testimony is received from all the wit-
nesses,  the  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  will  begin  their  ques-
tions to the witnesses, which we will also limit to five minutes.

We  will  start  with  Congresswoman  Jo  Ann  Davis,  who  will  lead
off  today,  and  hopefully,  will  be  followed  by  Congressman  Dennis
Kucinich, who I am assured will be here shortly. And then, we will
go  right  to  our  panel  of  experts,  as  soon  as  the  two  witnesses,
Members  of  Congress,  complete  their  testimony.  If  those  witness
could  please  come  to  the  witness  table.  And  here  is  Mr.  Kucinich.
Which  will  begin  with  NASA’s  Associate  Administrator  for  Aero-
nautics, Dr. Vic Lebacqz.

And with that, Congresswoman Davis, you may begin.

Panel I:

STATEMENT OF HON. JO ANN DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN

CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA

Ms.  DAVIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Udall,
and  other  distinguished  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  want  to
thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  before  your  subcommittee
this morning on the future of aeronautics in this country.

I  appreciate  your  holding  a  hearing  on  this  important  subject,
which is truly becoming a matter of national security. I also appre-
ciate Congressman Kucinich’s appearance here this morning on be-
half of NASA Glenn Research Center in Ohio.

I  am  proud  to  represent  the  engineers  and  technicians  at  NASA
Langley Research Center, who made United States aeronautics re-
search  and  testing  the  envy  of  the  world  for  over  88  years.  First
established  as  the  Langley  Memorial  Aeronautical  Laboratory  in
1917, it was the Nation’s first civil aeronautics research laboratory
under  the  charter  of  the  National  Advisory  Committee  for  Aero-
nautics, the precursor to the modern-day NASA.

Mr.  Chairman,  there  is  no  doubt  that  we  have  been  pioneers  in
this  highly  specialized  field  for  most  of  the  last  century.  My  con-
cern  is  that  recent  and  future  cuts  will  simply  make  us  unable  to
retain this advantage in the future.

In recent years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion, the NASA budget, has seen modest increases. However, at the
same time, the aeronautics programs within NASA have been dra-
matically  reduced.  Over  the  last  decade,  funding  for  NASA  aero-
nautics research has declined by more than half, to about $900 mil-
lion. In addition, the President’s budget proposes to cut aeronautics
research  by  an  additional  20  percent  over  the  next  20  years—over
the next five years.

I  have  serious  concerns  that  the  United  States  is  losing  critical
expertise  in  aeronautics  research  and  development.  This  degrada-
tion  will  have  a  tragic  impact  on  military  and  civilian  aviation,
which  contributes  significantly  to  our  country’s  national  defense
and our economy.

The  U.S.  military  has  benefited  tremendously  from  NASA  aero-
nautics  research.  The  single  most  important  benefit  of  the  Depart-
ment of Defense and NASA Langley’s partnership is in the applica-
tion  of  new  technologies  to  this  nation’s  military  aircraft.  Every
aviation  asset  in  the  military’s  inventory  was  designed  with  the
help of NASA’s experts, and NASA conducted wind tunnel tests for
the Department of Defense or their contractors on the F–14, F–15,
F–16,  F–18,  F–22,  JSF,  B–1,  C–141,  C–5,  and  the  C–17,  just  to
name a few.

I think we can all agree that the combined contributions of these
aircraft  have  been  significant  in  our  achievement  of  military  supe-
riority  in  the  skies.  Not  only  have  NASA  researchers  made  U.S.
military  vehicles  technologically  superior,  they  have  helped  deter-
mine  the  capabilities  of  our  enemies  by  testing  and  analyzing  for-
eign warplanes for the defense and intelligence communities. With-
out  proper  funding,  this  capability  will  perish,  and  will  be  exceed-
ingly difficult to restore.

In  addition,  the  U.S.  civil  aviation  industry,  which  plays  an  im-
portant  role  in  the  U.S.  economy,  has  benefited  from  NASA  re-
search.  This  vital  sector  of  our  economy  employs  over  two  million
Americans,  and  comprises  roughly  nine  percent  of  our  country’s
Gross  National  Product.  This  strength  is  a  direct  result  of  the  in-
vestment  in  aeronautics  research  over  the  past  several  decades.
Nonetheless,  the  industry  has  been  declining  over  the  past  several
years, and now, only holds 50 percent of the world market.

While U.S. aeronautics research and testing programs are declin-
ing,  countries  in  Europe  and  elsewhere  are  investing  heavily  in
aeronautics  research.  The  health  of  the  U.S.  aviation  industry  de-
pends  on  aeronautics  research  and  development,  especially  long-
term  research  that  cannot—that  they  cannot  and  will  not  perform
themselves, in order to compete on the world market. NASA is the
only,  and  I  repeat,  the  only  federal  agency  that  supports  research
on  civilian  aircraft.  Their  researchers  are  working  to  make  our
planes  and  our  skies  safer,  and  I  believe  that  this  is  a  worthwhile
investment of the taxpayer’s money.

Given the importance of NASA aeronautics research and testing,
I am very concerned that NASA does not have a coherent vision for
aeronautics  programs.  Past  blueprints  and  other  guiding  docu-
ments seem to have been discarded, most likely because NASA did
not have the aeronautics budget to support them.

As  I  briefly  noted  today,  the  importance  of  aeronautics  research
is  obvious.  We  cannot  afford  to  lose  the  aeronautical  advantage
that is vital to our national defense and to our economy.

Again,  I  want  to  thank  you,  Chairman  Calvert,  for  holding  a
hearing  on  this  important  issue,  and  I  am  glad  you  thought  it  im-
portant enough to be your first hearing of the 109th Congress. I ap-
preciate  all  of  your  work  and  your  staff’s  work,  and  I  thank  you,
also, to the witnesses for being here this morning.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  before  your  subcommittee  this  morning
on  the  future  of  aeronautics  in  this  country.  I  appreciate  you  holding  a  hearing  on

Mr.  Chairman,  there  is  no  doubt  that  we  have  been  pioneers  in  this  highly  spe-

cialized field for most of the last century.

My  concern  is  that  recent  and  future  cuts  will  simply  make  us  unable  to  retain

this advantage in the future.

In  recent  years,  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)
budget  has  seen  modest  increases.  However,  at  the  same  time,  aeronautics  pro-
grams within NASA have been dramatically reduced. Over the last decade, funding
for NASA’s aeronautics research has declined by more than half, to about $900 mil-

nautics  research  and  development.  This  degradation  will  have  a  tragic  impact  on
military  and  civilian  aviation,  which  contributes  significantly  to  our  country’s  na-
tional defense and economy.

The  U.S.  military  has  benefited  tremendously  from  NASA  aeronautics  research.
The  single  most  important  benefit  of  the  Department  of  Defense  and  NASA
Langley’s partnership is in the application of new technologies to this nation’s mili-
tary aircraft.

Every  aviation  asset  in  the  military’s  inventory  was  designed  with  the  help  of

contributions  of  these  aircraft  have  been  significant  in  our  achievement  of  military
superiority in the skies.

Not  only  have  NASA  researchers  made  U.S.  military  vehicles  technologically  su-
perior,  they  have  helped  determine  the  capabilities  of  our  enemies  by  testing  and
analyzing  foreign  warplanes  for  the  defense  and  intelligence  communities.  Without
proper funding, this capability will perish and will be exceedingly difficult to restore.
In addition, the U.S. civil aviation industry, which plays an important role in the
U.S.  economy,  has  benefited  from  NASA  research.  This  vital  sector  of  our  economy
employs  over  two  million  Americans  and  comprises  roughly  nine  percent  of  our
country’s  Gross  National  Product  (GNP).  This  strength  is  a  direct  result  of  the  in-
vestment in aeronautics research over the past several decades. Nonetheless, the in-
dustry  has  been  declining  over  the  past  several  years  and  now  only  holds  fifty  per-
cent of the world market.

While  U.S.  aeronautics  research  and  testing  programs  are  declining,  countries  in
Europe  and  elsewhere  are  investing  heavily  in  aeronautics  research.  The  health  of
the U.S. aviation industry depends on aeronautics research and development—espe-
cially  long-term  research  that  they  cannot  and  will  not  perform  themselves—in
order to compete in the world market. NASA is the ONLY federal agency that sup-
ports research on civilian aircraft. Their researchers are working to make our planes
and our skies safer, and I believe this is a worthwhile investment of the taxpayers’
money.

Given  the  importance  of  NASA  aeronautics  research  and  testing,  I  am  very  con-
cerned  that  NASA  does  not  have  a  coherent  vision  for  aeronautics  programs.  Past
blueprints  and  other  guiding  documents  seem  to  have  been  discarded—most  likely
because NASA did not have the aeronautics budget to support them.

As  I  have  briefly  noted  today,  the  importance  of  aeronautics  research  is  obvious.
We cannot afford to lose the aeronautical advantage that is vital to our national de-
fense and economy.

Again, thank you Chairman Calvert for holding a hearing on this important issue.
I  appreciate  all  of  your  work  and  your  staff’s  work,  and  thank  you  also  to  the  wit-
nesses for being here this morning.

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  thank  the  gentlelady  for  her  testimony.

Mr. Kucinich, you are recognized.

STATEMENT OF HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH, A

REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO
Mr.  KUCINICH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  Members  of  the
Committee. I am privileged to be here with Representative Jo Ann
Davis  on  this  important  matter  relating  to  aeronautics  in  the
United States.

She  pointed  out  there  is  no  vision  for  aeronautics.  Sitting  right
behind you on the wall, come to this committee, are the words from
Proverbs, which says: ‘‘Where there is no vision, the people perish.’’
So, it is important that we are here talking about the future of aer-
onautics.

Today, I am going to make the case that aeronautics research is
essential  to  America’s  national  security,  quality  of  life,  economy,
safety, and environment. NASA has played, and should continue to
play,  a  crucial  role  in  aeronautics.  Yet,  it  is  at  grave  risk  of  being
undermined  as  a  result  of  current  efforts  to  eliminate  jobs,  facili-
ties,  and  entire  programs.  We  must  not  allow  the  erosion  of  aero-
nautics at NASA.

NASA’s contribution to the field of aeronautics to the Nation and
world  are  profound.  A  good  starting  point  is  aeronautics’  contribu-
tion  to  national  security.  From  further  surveillance—from  surveil-
lance  systems  that  monitor  aircraft  flight  paths,  to  the  develop-
ment  of  secure  communication  systems,  NASA’s  research  has  been
instrumental  in  improving  our  national  security.  In  addition,
NASA’s  recent  successful  hypersonic  flight,  clocked  at  about  7,000
miles  per  hour,  demonstrated  that  military  or  civilian  aircraft
might  soon  be  able  to  fly  anywhere  in  the  world  in  less  than  two
hours.  Aeronautical  vehicles  are  a  substantial  and  key  part  of  the
national defense infrastructure.

NASA’s aeronautics programs also contribute substantially to the
Nation’s  economy.  The  NASA  Glenn  Research  Center  in  Brook
Park, Ohio, for example, is a cornerstone of Ohio’s fragile economy,
and  a  stronghold  of  aeronautics  research.  In  fiscal  year  2003,
spending  at  Glenn  on  contracts  and  grants  generated  over  $430
million  of  earnings  for  Ohio  households.  And  studies  have  shown
that it has over a billion dollar impact on the economy of northeast
Ohio.  Civil  aeronautics  is  also  a  major  contributor  to  this  sector’s
positive  balance  of  trade,  more  than  any  other  industry.  Aero-
nautics  contributes  to  a  stronger  economy  by  lowering  the  cost  of
transportation,  enabling  a  new  generation  of  service-based  indus-
tries  like  e-commerce  to  flourish,  and  by  performing  the  research
that leads to inexpensive and reliable flights.

Safety has advanced considerably because of NASA’s elimination
of wind shear as a cause of airline accidents, their improved detec-
tion  of  corrosion  and  cracks,  their  anti-icing  and  deicing  research,
advanced  air  traffic  management  technology,  and  others.  Again,
much of that research came from NASA Glenn. Other contributions
include  noise  reduction  and  emissions  eliminations,  both  of  which
will be limiting factors to expansion of air traffic in the future.

Finally,  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  is  important,  because
NASA is able to develop long-term, high-risk enabling technologies
that  the  private  sector  is  unwilling  to  perform,  because  it  is  too
risky  or  too  expensive.  In  fact,  this  has  historically  been  the  role
of government-sponsored research. This is true not only with aero-

nautics,  but  with  pharmaceutical  research,  defense  research,  en-
ergy  research,  environmental  research,  and  much  more.  When  the
government-sponsored  basic  research  yields  information  that  could
lead to a service or product with profit potential, the private sector
transitions  from  research  to  development  in  order  to  bring  it  to
market.  While  it  is  not  always  as  simple  as  this,  it  is  clear  that
where  there  is  no  basic  research,  there  can  be  no  development.
Where  there  is  no  basic  research,  there  could  be  no  development,
and  what  is  happening  with  this  new  policy  is  we  are  getting  out
of basic research in aeronautics.

Yet  aeronautics  research  in  NASA  is  being  attacked  from  mul-
tiple  angles.  The  most  recent  and  most  potentially  devastating
threats  come  from  the  fiscal  year  2006  budget  proposal,  which
would  result  in  major  losses  of  key  aeronautics  proposals.  The
greatest  cuts  would  be  felt  at  NASA  Glenn  and  at  NASA  Langley
in  Virginia,  and  that  is  why  I  am  here  with  Representative  Davis,
on  behalf  of  aeronautics.  If  this  dark  vision  is  realized,  we  are
going to be ceding aeronautic superiority to Europe. The effects are
exacerbated  by  a  recent  shift  in  the  market  share  for  aeronautics
to the Europeans. For example, Boeing is now doing testing in Eu-
rope. The European company Airbus is also fast becoming the lead-
er  in  aircraft  design  with  its  new  A380  being  touted  as  the  most
advanced,  spacious,  and  efficient  airliner  ever  conceived.  Think
about  that  when  you  think  about  America’s  traditional  role  as  a
leader in aerospace, and you realize why it is absolutely wrong for
anything  that  would  deter  from  our  mission  in  basic  research  in
aeronautics.

We  already  stand  to  lose  valuable  personnel.  NASA  aeronautics
jobs are good paying jobs that attract people to areas hosting a cen-
ter,  and  keeping  them  there.  But  the  recent  proposed  cuts  would
eliminate 700 NASA jobs from Glenn, 1,100 NASA jobs from Lang-
ley,  and  those  two  centers  are  the  cornerstones  of  aeronautics  re-
search  in  the  United  States.  An  undetermined  number  of  con-
tractor  jobs  are  at  risk.  It  is  important  to  understand  that  threats
to job stability posed by funding losses will encourage the Nation’s
most  talented  scientists  and  engineers,  who  now  work  for  the
United  States  of  America,  to  look  elsewhere  for  work.  And  some
have already started to do so.

I want to submit the rest of the testimony for the record.
Chairman CALVERT. Without objection.
Mr.  KUCINICH.  And  ask  that  the  Committee,  if  they  have  any

questions, please feel free to ask.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE DENNIS J. KUCINICH

Thank you, Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member Udall, for the opportunity to
testify  about  The  Future  of  Aeronautics  at  NASA.  Today,  I  will  make  the  case  that

secure  communication  systems  NASA’s  research  has  been  instrumental  in  improv-
ing  our  national  security.  In  addition,  NASA’s  recent  successful  hypersonic  flight,
clocked at about 7,000 miles per hour, demonstrated that military or civilian aircraft
might soon be able to fly anywhere in the world in less than two hours. Aeronautical
vehicles are a substantial and key part of the national defense infrastructure.

NASA’s  aeronautics  programs  also  contribute  substantially  to  the  Nation’s  econ-
omy. The NASA Glenn Research Center in Brook Park, Ohio, for example, is a cor-
nerstone of the state’s fragile economy and a stronghold of aeronautics research. In
FY03, Glenn spending on contracts and grants generated over $430 million of earn-
ings for Ohio households. Civil aeronautics is also the major contributor to this sec-
tor’s  positive  balance  of  trade—more  than  any  other  industry.  Aeronautics  contrib-
utes  to  a  stronger  economy  by  lowering  the  cost  of  transportation,  enabling  a  new
generation of service based industries like e-commerce to flourish by performing the
research that leads to inexpensive and reliable flights.

Safety has advanced considerably because of NASA’s elimination of wind shear as
a  cause  of  airline  accidents,  their  improved  detection  of  corrosion  and  cracks,  their
anti-icing  and  deicing  research,  advanced  air  traffic  management  technology,  and

include  noise  reduction,  and  emissions  eliminations,  both  of  which  will  be  limiting
factors to expansion of air travel in the future.

Finally,  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  is  important  because  NASA  is  able  to  de-
velop long-term, high-risk enabling technologies that the private sector is unwilling
to  perform  because  it  is  too  risky  or  too  expensive.  In  fact,  this  is  historically  been
the  role  of  government  sponsored  research.  This  is  true  not  only  with  aeronautics
but  also  with  pharmaceutical  research,  defense  research,  energy  research,  environ-
mental  research  and  much  more.  When  the  government  sponsored  basic  research
yields  information  that  could  lead  to  a  service  or  product  with  profit  potential,  the
private sector transitions from research to development in order to bring it to mar-
ket. While it is not always as simple as this, it is clear that where there is no basic
research, there can be no development.

Yet  aeronautics  research  in  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration
is  being  attacked  from  multiple  angles.  The  most  recent  and  most  potentially  dev-
astating  threats  came  in  the  form  of  the  Administration’s  FY06  budget  proposal,
which  would  result  in  major  losses  of  key  aeronautics  programs.  The  greatest  cuts
would be felt at NASA Glenn and at NASA Langley in Virginia. If the Administra-
tion’s  vision  for  the  weakening  of  aeronautics  at  NASA  is  realized,  we  cede  aero-
nautics  superiority  to  Europe.  The  effects  are  exacerbated  by  a  recent  shift  in  the
market  share  for  aeronautics  to  the  Europeans.  For  example,  Boeing  is  now  doing
its testing in Europe. The European company Airbus is also fast becoming the lead-
er in aircraft design with its new A380, being touted as the most advanced, spacious
and efficient airliner ever conceived.

We already stand to lose valuable personnel. NASA aeronautics jobs are well pay-
ing jobs that attract people to areas hosting a center and keep them there. But the
recent  proposed  cuts  could  eliminate  700  NASA  jobs  from  Glenn  and  1100  NASA
jobs  from  Langley,  the  two  cornerstones  of  aeronautics  research.  An  undetermined
number of contractor job are also at risk. It is important to understand that threats
to  job  stability  posed  by  funding  losses  will  encourage  the  Nation’s  most  talented
scientists and engineers to look elsewhere for work. And some have already started
to do so.

The Agency is also considering shutting down several unique and expensive facili-
ties,  without  consideration  of  their  income  generation  potential  through  enhanced
use leasing. The world-class wind tunnels at NASA Glenn are a classic example. Al-
lowing private and university researchers to use them could result in significant in-
come,  which  would  increase  the  efficient  use  of  the  facilities,  and  would  contribute
to  more  scientific  output.  The  wind  tunnels  alone  would  require  tens  of  millions  of
dollars to replace.

We must not allow our dominance in aeronautics to atrophy. Clearly, NASA’s role
has  historically  been  critical  and  can  continue  to  be  critical  to  our  country’s  pros-
perity  if  we  have  the  foresight  to  make  it  so.  Make  no  mistake;  it  will  require  a
long-term  effort.  But  it  will  be  worthwhile.  In  the  meantime,  it  will  be  imperative
that we stop the anti-aeronautics cuts to the budget.

First,  we  need  to  immediately  restore  and  strengthen  funding  for  NASA  aero-
nautics  research  that  is  an  economic  engine  for  aeronautics  and  aerospace  indus-
tries. Secondly, we must examine creative approaches to funding like enhanced use
leasing  in  all  NASA  facilities.  Before  deciding  which  facilities  to  mothball,  NASA
should  take  into  account  the  increase  in  assets  enhanced  use  leasing  would  bring.
Third,  the  facilities  that  require  renovation  must  be  funded  as  such,  since  it  is
cheaper to upgrade than to rebuild the facilities.

Of  course,  there  is  much  more  that  needs  to  be  done.  I  hope  this  important  dia-
logue  continues  and  intensifies.  The  future  of  aeronautics,  not  just  at  NASA,  but
in America, is at stake.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  also  like  to  submit  the  following  resolutions  from  various

governmental entities as part of my testimony.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  thank  both  of  you  for  your  excellent  testi-
mony.  If  there  are  no  questions  for  the  two  Members.  Questions?
Mr. Rohrabacher.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  would  like  to  ask  our  two  witnesses  to  tell
me  which  part  of  the  NASA  budget  that  they  would  like  to  take
the  money  from  in  order  to  bolster  this  part  of  the  NASA  budget
that they are supporting today.

Ms.  DAVIS.  Mr.  Rohrabacher,  what  I  would  like  to  see  is  that
there  be  a  separate  line  item  for  a  national—for  aeronautics,  and
a  separate  one  for  space.  I  think  that  right  now,  we  have  a  vision
for  space.  We  have  no  vision  for  aeronautics.  My  concern  is  na-
tional security.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Are  there  any  programs  in  NASA  that  you
feel are of less priority that we could take the money from, in order
to  fulfill  the  noble  objectives  that  both  of  you  have  set  out  today?
Ms. DAVIS. Maybe not from NASA, but I believe the way the ap-
propriations  works,  there  are  other  projects  within  that  pot  of
money  that  we  can—I  have  an  offset  in  mind,  and  I  will  be  pre-
senting that as an amendment, sir.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  You  have  a  part  of  NASA  that  has  less  pri-

ority, that you think that the money could come from?

Mr.  KUCINICH.  Along  with  you,  Representative  Rohrabacher,  I
have been a strong supporter of the space program, as well as aero-
nautics,  and  I  see  the  connection.  Because  for  example,  with  the
Shuttle,  when  the  Shuttle  goes  up,  it  is  a  space  vehicle.  When  it
comes  back,  it  relies  on  aeronautical  technology  in  order  to  land.
So  you  know,  there  always  is  a  connection.  That  is  why  they  call
it  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration,  but  we  are
going  to  take  the  A  out  of  that,  and  it  will  just  be  the  National
Space Administration.

I don’t want to see the NASA budget cut anywhere. But the fact
of  the  matter  is,  Mr.  Chairman,  we  are  looking  at  more  than  a
$500 billion budget deficit. This is kind of an odd time for us to be
looking at the one area where we can grow our economy, and start
cutting  there.  NASA  is  the  path  out  of  a  budget  deficit,  with  the
kind  of  research  and  development  which  the  system  is  capable  of
doing. So, we shouldn’t be looking at any cuts in any way.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  It  is  very  easy  to  advocate  spending  more
money. It is very difficult to find prudent ways of trimming things
from  the  budget.  And  that  is  not  just  for  Members  of  Congress.  I
mean,  we  have  witnesses  after  witnesses  after  witnesses,  I  think
I have been here 16 years now, and I don’t remember even one wit-
ness who was able to put the lowest priority. They are always able
to  say  everything  we  got  to  spend  the  money  on,  but  never  can
come up with some idea of where we could, things, perhaps, aren’t
being  spent  wisely,  and  could  be  better  spent  on  the  program  they
were advocating today.

Mr. KUCINICH. If I may, to my friend, Mr. Rohrabacher. What we
are  doing  would  be  akin  to  asking  a  farmer  to  save  money  by
throwing away some of his seed corn. Or—I mean, we——

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Or  maybe,  get  rid  of  the  whiskey  allotment

that he uses for holidays or something like that.

Mr. KUCINICH. Well, I think that—there is—NASA can hardly be
accused  of  spending  money  like  someone  who  is  interested  in  self-
enjoyment here, but I think——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Kucinich, wouldn’t you admit that NASA
is  just  like  every  other  organization?  There  has  got  to  be  things
that  are  of  less  priority,  and  other  things  that  are  of  higher  pri-
ority.

Mr.  KUCINICH.  Well,  we  sure  haven’t  found  them  in  aeronautics.

I can tell you that.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. All right.
Mr.  KUCINICH.  And  that  is  why  I  am  here.  And  I  agree—listen,
I  am  with  you  on  space  exploration,  but  why  should  space—why
should  one  come  at  the  expense  of  the  other?  Because  the  two  are
together.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman for his question. Any

other questions for this panel? Mr. Forbes.

Mr.  FORBES.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  Mr.  Chairman,  I
think  Mr.  Rohrabacher  is  exactly  right.  This  should  be  about  look-
ing  at  priorities.  I  just  don’t  believe  that  aeronautical  research  is
quite  akin  to  whiskey  allotment.  And  you  know,  as  I  look  around
this room, I am a strong supporter of the space program, but prob-
ably,  I  don’t  know,  maybe  there  is  somebody,  but  I  don’t  know  of
anybody  that  has  been  in  space  sitting  in  this  room,  but  I  know
just  about  everybody  here  has  probably  been  on  an  airplane,  and
Congressman  Davis,  I  appreciate  the  fact  that  you  are  here,  be-
cause  I  know  you  serve  on  the  Armed  Services  Committee,  and  I
think  the  Intelligence  Committee,  and  are  you  still  on  the  Foreign
Relations Committee, there——

Ms. DAVIS. Yes, sir.
Mr. FORBES. And you have traveled around the world, and there
are  two  things  that  I  want  to  ask  you  about.  One  is  if  you  could
elaborate  a  little  bit  more  on  the  national  security  issue  that  you
raised  to  us.  But  secondly,  one  of  the  things  I  hear  over  and  over
again,  and  Mr.  Kucinich  touched  on  this,  so  goes  our  research,  so
goes  the  industry.  But  I  hear  over  and  over  again  about  the  dif-
ficulties  that  we  are  having  in  attracting  and  retaining  top  flight
engineers  and  researchers,  and  when  I  look  at  this  budget,  for
Langley, in particular, it goes from $805 million in ’04, $668 in ’05,
$557  in  ’06,  $479  in  ’07.  I  know  there  is  nobody  that  has  been  on
the ground at Langley with the personnel more than you.

Can you elaborate a little bit more on, one, the national security
concerns that you have, and secondly, the impact these budgets are
having  on  the  retention  of  top  quality  engineers  and  researchers?
Ms.  DAVIS.  Well,  I  will  tackle  the  second  part  of  the  question
first.  And  my  concern  is,  with  the  jobs  at  Langley,  but  not  major
concern.  My  major  concern  is  national  security.  As  you  well  elabo-
rated,  I  am  on  Armed  Services  and  Intelligence,  and  International
Relations as well. And yes, we stand to lose a lot of brainpower at
NASA Langley and at Glenn.

I  had  someone  in  my  office  the  other  day  telling  me  that  we  are
now  down  to  graduating,  I  think  last  year  in  the  United  States,
75,000  engineers,  out  of  which  35,000  were  Chinese,  while  China
was  graduating  a  million,  Japan  was  graduating  750,000.  That  is
worrisome  to  me.  It  is  worrisome  to  me  that  we  are  turning  over

59

our  aeronautics  and  research  to  other  countries  other  than  the
United States.

On  a  national  security  level,  it  bothers  me  that  the  JSF  that  I
mentioned,  that  was  tested  at  Langley,  it  is  also  being  tested  in
Europe. It bothers me that we will be looking to other countries to
give us the research and development for our military, for our mili-
tary  aircraft.  Today’s  allies  may  be  tomorrow’s  adversaries.  I  am
not  interested  in  the  technology  coming  from  the  other  countries.
I  think  we  need  to  retain  that  superiority  here  in  the  United
States.

There is a reason NASA Langley is located next door to Langley
Air  Force  Base,  because  there  has  been  a  partnership  for  many,
many years, and I just would hate to see us lose that. And I think
that  the  way  we  are  going,  we  are  heading  down  that  path,  and
I think it would be a national tragedy.

Mr.  KUCINICH.  Mr.  Forbes.  Mr.  Forbes.  If  I  may,  Representative
Davis,  you  are  absolutely  right.  I  mean,  we  have  to  look  to  the  fu-
ture  here,  of  America’s  defense  capabilities,  and  if  we  cede  the
building  of  airplanes,  to  let  us  say,  the  Chinese  market,  we  could
be  looking  at  a  condition  in  the  future  where  we  don’t  have  the
technology we need to defend this country, and it is a very serious
question.

I  mean,  one  of  the  first  things  that  happened  when  I  came  to
Congress  was  that  a  representative  of  one  of  the  largest  aircraft
manufacturers  in  the  world  came  in  our  office,  and  asked  me  to
vote for the China Trade Bill, which I didn’t do. But they admitted,
when  I  questioned  them,  that  the  price  of  their  entry  into  the
China market was to give China the prototypes of development air-
craft. Now, we have to be concerned that we are giving up our posi-
tion  of  superiority  for  the  future,  and  so,  I  am  totally  supportive
of what Representative Davis has said.

Mr. FORBES. Thank you, Mr. Kucinich, and I just want to add to
what  they  said.  There  was  an  individual  researcher  that  told  me
the  other  day,  he  was  invited  to  China  to  give  a  talk  to  a  group
of engineers. He felt he would meet with 200 of them when he went
there. There were 5,000 engineers in the room when he went there,
so  it  is  a  big  concern  for  us,  and  thank  you  both  for  being  here
today.

Ms.  DAVIS.  I  might  say,  Mr.  Forbes,  there  is  a  reason  Marine

One is not being totally built in the United States.

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  thank  the  gentleman  from  Virginia.  The

gentleman from California, Mr. Honda.

Mr.  HONDA.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  appreciate  your
putting  this  hearing  together,  and  I  appreciate  Congresswoman
Davis  and  Kucinich’s  comments,  and  Mr.  Chairman,  since  I  won’t
be here for the full length, I would like to submit some of my ques-
tions in writing.

Chairman CALVERT. Without objection, so ordered.
Mr.  HONDA.  And  hopefully,  expect  a  response  in  writing,  some
time definite point in the future. And I, too, support both Congress-
woman Davis and Congressman Kucinich’s position. And regarding
the  budget,  I  think  what  we  did  in  the  NASA  budget  is  take  all
the money out of aeronautics and put it into space. And so, we are
messing  around  with  the  budget  within  its  own  self,  and  so,  some

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:40 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 020007 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\031605\20007 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

60

people  would  call  that  a  neutral  budget  action,  but  it  is  really  not
neutral.  It  is  a  deficit,  in  the  sense  that  as  they  have  quite  well
said,  it  is  going  to  put  us  back,  and  it  is  not  going  to  allow  us  to
perform the mission that has been set out for us.

This  budget  has  been  set  up  as  a  full  accounting  process,  and
looking  at  FTEs  and  bottom  line,  and  you  force  the  budget  that
way, versus the mission that is stated. If this were a mission-driv-
en budget, it would look different, and the people would be treated
differently.  And  I  think  that  that  is  the  big  question  that  we  have
before  Congress.  As  to  where  would  you  get  the  money,  well,  the
budget is not only NASA. The budget is, in its entirety, a little over
$2.5  trillion,  in  terms  of  the  President’s  budget,  and  I  think  there
has  been  a  lot  of  activities  on  the  Floor  as  to  how  we  look  at  our
budget.

And  you  know,  we  had  the  issue  of  the  Truman  Commission,
which looks for waste, and I am sure that we can find some moneys
in that category. I think when Truman did it, they found over $15
billion.  In  those  days,  that  was  a  lot  of  money.  In  today’s  count,
that would be sufficient for what it is that you are looking for.

And  we  are  looking  at  other  items  that  won’t  even  show  up  to
our  budget,  and  I  think  that  that,  if  we  looked  at  those
supplementals,  we  might  find  sufficient  funding  there.  So,  the
budget is not just NASA. It is in its entirety, and if our budget re-
flects  our  priorities,  this  certainly  was  thinned  back,  as  Congress-
woman Davis and Kucinich is asking, to look at that, and we ana-
lyze, before it is too late, our position on ASA. Thank you.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Thank  you.  I  will  recognize  Mr.  Bartlett,
and then, we will get right to our panel. The gentleman from Mary-
land.

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much.
I  just  wanted  to  note—I  would  like  to  comment  on  something
that Congresswoman Davis said. The budget item that we are talk-
ing  about  today  is  simply  a  symptom  of  a  very  much  larger  prob-
lem. The numbers you gave about the number of engineers that are
being  trained  in  our  country,  and  the  percentage  of  those,  nearly
half  of  those,  were  Chinese,  and  then,  the  numbers  being  trained
elsewhere, is a very alarming trend.

A society gets what it appreciates, and the truth is, in this coun-
try, we do not appreciate academic achievers, bright young men in
our schools are called geeks and nerds, and pretty girls won’t date
them,  and  a  really  bright  girl  will  play  dumb,  so  that  she  can  get
a  date.  Now,  what  do  you  expect  the  result  is  going  to  be,  when
this is the kind of a culture that you have in your country. Yet, we
need to be inviting academic achievers to the White House, and we
need to be praising them and holding them up at least as much as
football players, thank you.

I  am  concerned.  I  am  concerned  that  for  the  short  run,  you  are
exactly  right.  Our  economic  superiority  is  at  risk.  We  will  not  con-
tinue  this  blessed  country,  where  one  person  out  of  22  has  25  per-
cent of all the good things in the world. We aren’t going to continue
to be here, unless we turn out scientists, mathematicians, and engi-
neers of quality in large enough numbers, and we are not doing it.
Ultimately,  you  are  exactly  right.  It  is  a  threat  to  our  military
superiority. We will not continue to be the world’s premier military

power if we are not turning out scientists, mathematicians, and en-
gineers  of  quality  in  large  enough  numbers,  and  we  are  not  doing
it today.

So,  thank  you  very  much  for  bringing  this  to  our  attention.  It  is
a  whole  lot  bigger  than  aeronautics.  That  is  just  a  system  of  a  big
problem our society has.

Mr.  KUCINICH.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  may,  I  want  to  thank  Rep-
resentative  Bartlett  for  defending  all  those  of  us  who  had  trouble
getting dates in high school.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Something  told  me  I  knew  that  all  along,

Dennis. I thank the panel, and we will now have our——

Ms. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  CALVERT.—full  panel  up.  Thank  you,  Congresswoman

Davis.

Thank  you,  gentlemen.  I  appreciate  your  coming  out  today,  and
Mr.  Lebacqz,  we  will  start  with  you.  You  are  recognized  for  five
minutes. You might turn your mike on, though.

Panel II:

STATEMENT OF DR. J. VICTOR LEBACQZ, ASSOCIATE ADMINIS-
TRATOR, AERONAUTICS RESEARCH MISSION DIRECTORATE,
NASA
Dr.  LEBACQZ.  There  we  go.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  It  is  a
pleasure  to  see  you  again.  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank
you. It is an honor for me to represent this fantastic agency to this
panel today.

If  I  might  take  a  moment.  Personally,  my  father  was  an  immi-
grant  to  this  country  from  Belgium,  after  the  first  World  War.
Came  on  a  scholarship  as  a  geek,  went  out  to  Stanford  to  get  a
Ph.D. There, he met my mother, who was a daughter of Norwegian
immigrants, who worked her way across the country teaching, and
also,  got  a  Ph.D.  at  Stanford  in  the  1930s.  So,  I  think  that  is  a
function of the fact that this country does represent opportunity for
all, and equality for all. And it is amazing that one generation after
two immigrants can do that, that their son represents this fantastic
agency in front of you, and I am grateful for the opportunity. I only
wish they were here to share it with me still.

So,  let  me  get  on  with  my  testimony.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  request

that my full testimony be entered into the record.

Chairman CALVERT. Without objection, so ordered.
Dr.  LEBACQZ.  The  NASA  aeronautics  research  portfolio  is  a  vital
part  of  NASA’s  mission,  to  pursue  the  President’s  vision  for  space
exploration,  both  in  our  continuing  development  of  new  tech-
nologies  that  improve  aviation  on  this  planet,  and  in  our  develop-
ment  of  aeronautical  science  platforms  to  fly  on  this  planet  and
those of other planets.

The  research  in  the  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate
supports  the  NASA  strategic  plan,  and  specifically,  strategic  objec-
tive #12 in our new document, the New Age of Exploration, and has
been formulated with your input, and the input of federal agencies,
industry, and academia, through our advisory committees.

The President’s Fiscal Year 2006 budget fully supports the aero-
nautics  program  priority  research  in  the  areas  of  reducing  aircraft

noise,  increasing  aviation  safety  and  security,  and  increasing  the
capacity and efficiency of the national airspace system. Our budget
request  also  supports  the  NASA  contributions  to  the  critical  na-
tional  planning  activities  that  have  been  identified  by  the  Inter-
agency Joint Planning and Development Office.

NASA’s  Fiscal  Year  2006  request  for  aeronautics  research  is
$852.3  million,  which  supports  three  programs.  The  Aviation  Safe-
ty  and  Security  program  protects  air  travelers  and  the  public  by
developing  technologies  for  both  the  national  airspace  system  and
the  aircraft  in  it.  We  are  focusing  on  technologies  that  can  reduce
air crash rates and reduce aviation injuries and fatalities, such as,
for  example,  synthetic  vision  systems  that  allow  us  to  see  through
fog  and  increase  the  safety  of  flying  in  bad  weather.  Additionally,
the  program  produces  technologies  that  can  reduce  the  vulner-
ability  of  the  national  aviation  system  to  terrorist  attacks,  such  as
integrated information technologies to predict trends.

Our second important program is our Airspace Systems program,
which works to enable major increases in the capacity and mobility
of  the  U.S.  air  transportation  system,  through  technology  transfer
and  development.  The  NASA  Airspace  Systems  Program  has  be-
come  an  essential  technology  provider  for  the  FAA’s  air  traffic
management  long-term  research  requirements.  We  have  already
transitioned  technologies  to  the  FAA  to  support  air  traffic  control-
lers, such as the Traffic Management Advisor, and we will be hav-
ing a major demonstration of our small aircraft transportation sys-
tem  at  Danville,  Virginia,  this  spring,  and  you  are  all  cordially  in-
vited to attend that.

Additionally, it is through our Airspace Systems program that we
support  the  Interagency  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office
that  I  mentioned  earlier.  We  are  honored  to  lead  one  of  the  eight
integrated  product  teams  that  will  be  instantiating  the  new  na-
tional transformed air transportation system for the JPDO.

Finally, the Vehicle Systems program develops and demonstrates
barrier-breaking  vehicle  concepts  and  technologies,  beyond  the
scope  of  conventional  air  vehicles,  which  protect  the  Earth’s  envi-
ronment and enables science missions. To ensure maximum benefit
to the taxpayer and to embrace the President’s vision, this program
will  be  undergoing  a  transformation  in  2006,  consistent  with  the
review of the National Research Council a year ago. It has been re-
focused  away  from  many  interdisciplinary  research  and  technology
projects  toward  four  specific  revolutionary  technology  projects  that
are described in my written testimony.

Today,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  U.S.  remains  a  global  power  in  avia-
tion.  10  years  ago,  I  would  have  likely  said,  as  did  Representative
Davis,  the  U.S.  is  the  global  leader  in  aviation.  Over  the  past  15
years, it is true, global competition has slowly, but steadily, eroded
our  supremacy  in  aviation.  60  years  ago,  Vannevar  Bush  wrote  in
his  insightful  report,  ‘‘Science,  the  Endless  Frontier:’’  ‘‘A  nation
which  depends  upon  others  for  its  new  basic  scientific  knowledge
will  be  slow  in  its  industrial  progress  and  weak  in  its  competitive
position in world trade.’’

As  I  talk  about  our  aeronautics  program  with  our  partners  and
stakeholders  in  academia,  industry,  and  the  government,  and  as
you may hear from other members of this panel, and have, in fact,

already heard this morning, there are at least two distinct philoso-
phies for this nation’s investment in aeronautical research. On the
one  hand,  there  are  those  who  think  aeronautics  and  aviation  is  a
mature  industry  and  market,  one  in  which  government’s  research
role is best scaled back and left to private industry. This view holds
that  market  forces  will  decide  the  Nation’s  future  as  a  commercial
aeronautics  power.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  those  who  think
there  are  many  breakthroughs  in  aeronautics  ahead,  and  worry
about  the  continuous  large  investments  by  foreign  governments
and competitors, and the apparent shrinking market share for U.S.
industry. This view holds that federal aeronautical investments are
important  for  the  Nation’s  future  military  and  economic  security.
Many  bipartisan  reports,  ranging  from  the  President’s  Commis-
sion on the Future of the Aerospace Industry, to the National Acad-
emies  Report,  ‘‘Securing  the  Future  of  U.S.  Air  Transportation:  A
System in Peril,’’ have called for a national aeronautics policy from
both  sides  of  this  policy  debate.  Perhaps,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  time
is,  in  fact,  right  for  a  vigorous  national  dialogue  leading  to  such  a
policy.

I thank you again for your attention. I look forward to my fellow

panelists, and I will be glad to answer questions from you.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Lebacqz follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF J. VICTOR LEBACQZ

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:

Four  months  ago,  on  November  16,  2004,  a  B–52  that  was  designed  in  the  early
1950’s  took-off  from  Edwards  Air  Force  Base  in  Southern  California  and  headed  to
a  test  range  over  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Mounted  underneath  the  starboard  wing  was
a  Pegasus  rocket  that  was  designed  in  the  1980’s.  Fitted  onto  the  Pegasus  in  place
of the nosecone was the X–43A, a small experimental scramjet (supersonic combus-
tible  ramjet)-powered  vehicle  designed  at  the  Langley  Research  Center  in  the  mid-
1990’s. Over the test range, the B–52 dropped the Pegasus, which propelled the X–
43 into free flight. The X–43A scramjet ignited and flew at approximately Mach 10,
nearly 7,000 mph, setting a new world record for an air-breathing vehicle, as it flew
at an altitude of approximately 110,000 feet.

This breakthrough provides a promise for the future. The talent and vision of the
people at our NASA Research Centers, joining forces with our industry team, made
this  breakthrough  a  reality,  turning  visionary  possibilities  into  incredible  realities.
As  the  President  said  last  January,  we  are  engaged  in  exploration  and  discovery,
and  breakthroughs  such  as  this  are  needed  to  enable  the  President’s  Vision  for
Space  Exploration.  Breakthroughs  power  the  future.  NASA’s  job  is  to  envision  the
future and make it a reality. This is our history and it is our future.

I  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  testify  on  aeronautics  research  at  NASA.  Our
aeronautics research portfolio is a vital part of NASA’s mission to pursue the Presi-
dent’s Vision for Space Exploration, both in our continuing development of new tech-
nologies  that  improve  aviation  on  this  planet,  and  in  our  development  of  aero-
nautical science platforms to fly on this and other planets. We are developing tech-
nologies to improve safety, reduce environmental impact and improve the efficiency
of  aviation  operations.  We  are  developing  technologies  to  permit  long-endurance
uninhabited aeronautical vehicles. It is an honor for me to explain how we are doing
so.
The Importance of Aeronautics and Its Role at NASA

Aeronautics  is  critical  to  national  military  and  economic  security,  transportation
mobility  and  freedom,  and  quality  of  life.  Air  superiority  and  the  ability  to  globally
deploy  our  forces  are  vital  to  the  national  interest.  Aviation  is  a  unique,  indispen-
sable part of our nation’s transportation system, providing unequaled speed and dis-
tance,  mobility  and  freedom  of  movement  for  our  nation.  Air  carriers  enplane  over
600  million  passengers  and  fly  over  600  billion  passenger  miles,  accounting  for  63
percent of individual one-way trips over 500 miles and 80 percent of trips over 1,000

miles. Airfreight carries 29 percent of the value of the Nation’s exports and imports
and is growing at over six percent annually. Global communications, commerce and
tourism  have  driven  international  growth  in  aviation  five  to  six  percent  annually,
well beyond annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. In many ways, the U.S.
has only begun to tap what is possible in air transportation. The U.S. has over 5,200
public-use  airports,  but  the  vast  majority  of  passengers  pass  through  a  little  more
than one percent of those airports and only about 10 percent are used to any signifi-
cant degree.

Aviation  and  the  aerospace  industry  support  over  15  million  Americans  in  high-
quality, high-paying jobs, second only to trucking in the transportation sector. Driv-
en  by  technology,  annual  growth  in  aviation  labor  productivity  over  the  past  40
years  has  averaged  3.6  percent,  compared  to  two  percent  for  U.S.  industry  as  a
whole.  Aviation  manufacturing  is  a  consistent  net  exporter,  adding  $30  billion  dol-
lars  annually  to  the  Nation’s  balance  of  trade.  Aviation  produces  and  uses  a  broad
base  of  technologies—from  computing  and  simulation  to  advanced  materials—sup-
porting the high technology industrial base of the country. Defense aviation provides
fast, flexible force projection for the U.S. Our military aircraft are unparalleled glob-
ally because they employ the most advanced technology.

Technological advances in aeronautics over the past 40 years, many of them first
pioneered by NASA, have enabled a ten-fold improvement in aviation safety, a dou-
bling  of  fuel  efficiency  with  reductions  in  emissions  per  operation,  a  50  percent  re-
duction  in  cost  to  travelers,  and  an  order  of  magnitude  reduction  in  noise  genera-
tion. In large part, the gains we have enjoyed have been due to the efficient transfer
of  the  benefits  of  technology  to  consumers  via  competitive  air  transportation  mar-
kets.

At  NASA  our  aeronautics  program  is  pioneering  and  validating  high-value  tech-
nologies  that  enable  discovery  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  through  practical  ap-
plications.  We  are  investing  in  the  revolutionary  technologies  that  will  ensure  the
success of our mission. To ensure maximum benefit to the taxpayer, and to embrace
the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  we  are  transforming  our  investment  in  Aero-
nautics  Research  in  order  to  more  sharply  focus  our  investment  on  revolutionary,
high-risk,  ‘‘barrier  breaking’’  technologies.  Toward  this  end,  the  NASA  Aeronautics
Vehicle  Systems  Program  (VSP)  has  been  refocused  away  from  research  and  tech-
nology  development  in  multiple  areas  toward  four  specific  revolutionary  technology
demonstration  projects  for  which  there  is  a  clear  government  research  role.  These
projects  will  address  critical  public  needs  related  to  reduction  of  aircraft  noise  and
emissions,  and  enable  new  science  missions.  The  revolutionary  technologies  devel-
oped  by  NASA  within  the  next  decade  will  form  the  basis  for  a  new  generation  of
environmentally  friendly  aircraft  and  will  enhance  U.S.  competitiveness  20  years
from now.

To  fulfill  our  mission  we  must  also  identify  the  national  facilities  that  are  re-
quired  to  support  our  programs.  Our  transformed  aeronautics  program  will  rely  on
a more focused set of facilities than exists today. Over the past several years many
reviews  have  been  performed  relative  to  our  national  aeronautical  facilities.  There
have  been  closures  and  changes.  However,  more  needs  to  be  done  to  avoid  the  per-
petuation  of  marginal  facilities  through  small,  evolutionary  change.  We  are  opti-
mistic that looking to the future will provide the framework necessary to define the
facilities, new and existing, that will enable success in aeronautics.
Roadmapping and the Strategic Plan

NASA is working toward the aeronautics R&D goals as published in The New Age
of  Exploration:  NASA’s  Direction  for  2005  and  Beyond.  In  Strategic  Objective  12  of
this  document,  we  commit  to  ‘‘provide  advanced  aeronautical  technologies  to  meet
the challenges of next generation systems in aviation, for civilian and scientific pur-
poses,  in  our  atmosphere  and  in  atmospheres  of  other  worlds.’’  These  aeronautics
R&D  goals  are  based  on  the  NASA  Aeronautics  Blueprint,  published  in  2002.  The
Aeronautics  Blueprint  articulates  goals  for  aeronautics  that  we  believe  can  achieve
the objectives set out in our Strategic Plan. As we looked forward and examined the
issues facing aviation, we recognized a need for new concepts and new technologies
to break through the current plateau facing aviation. Achieving big increases in ca-
pacity  and  mobility,  while  improving  safety  and  reducing  environmental  impacts,
was  not  feasible  within  today’s  construct  and  technology  baseline.  What  we  found
was  that  emerging  technologies,  when  combined  with  advances  in  traditional  aero-
space disciplines, can enable new system concepts that operate at levels of perform-
ance that eclipse current systems.

We  use  the  Blueprint  to  help  guide  and  prioritize  our  investments.  The  process
we began in 2002 with the publication of the Blueprint—the framework and empha-
sis  of  the  Blueprint—is  reflected  in  our  current  program  restructuring.  Next  steps

include  more  detailed  systems  analysis  and  technology  roadmapping.  We  are  also
exploring  a  way  to  use  the  National  Research  Council  to  perform  a  decadal  survey
to help us better understand the Nation’s future needs in aeronautics.

NASA has initiated a new roadmapping endeavor to better define all of our activi-
ties.  One  of  these  roadmaps  is  focused  on  aeronautics.  To  this  end  we  have  devel-
oped  a  Federal  Advisory  Committee  Act  (FACA)  team,  consisting  of  industry,  aca-
demia,  government,  military,  and  local  government  planning  representatives,  to
evaluate and draft strategic roadmaps that will help guide our long-range goals, ca-
pabilities, and enabling technologies. We intend to deliver the aeronautics roadmap
this  fall,  and  invite  you  to  participate  by  providing  input  and  comment.  This  inter-
action  will  help  direct  future  investment  decisions  represented  in  the  integrated
NASA Strategic Roadmap.

As we begin this process, a broader national dialog on the aeronautics R&D goals
for  this  roadmap  may  be  appropriate  as  we  enter  the  second  century  of  aviation.
These  discussions  should  include  a  range  of  stakeholders  and  customers,  including
the  Congress.  This  process  could  lead  to  a  national  consensus  for  aeronautics  R&D
goals.
Joint Planning and Development Office

Last  year’s  FAA  Reauthorization  Bill,  VISION–100  (P.L.  108–176),  created  the
Next Generation Air Transportation System Joint Planning and Development Office
(JPDO)  with  the  goal  to  develop  an  integrated,  multi-agency  ‘‘National  Plan’’  to
transform the Nation’s air transportation system to meet the needs of the year 2025
while  providing  substantial  near-term  benefits.  The  National  Plan—in  essence,  a
roadmap  for  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System—has  six  overarching
goals:  (1)  Promote  economic  growth  and  create  jobs;  (2)  Expand  system  flexibility
and deliver capacity to meet future demands; (3) Tailor services to customer needs;
(4)  Ensure  national  defense  readiness;  (5)  Promote  aviation  safety  and  environ-
mental stewardship; and (6) Retain and enhance U.S. leadership and economic com-
petitiveness in global aviation.

The  JPDO—composed  of  NASA,  the  FAA,  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology
Policy  (OSTP),  and  the  Departments  of  Transportation,  Commerce,  Defense,  and
Homeland  Security—working  in  close  collaboration  with  other  public  and  private
sector  experts,  created  and  published  the  National  Plan,  entitled  Next  Generation
Air  Transportation  System  Integrated  Plan,  referred  to  as  NGATS,  that  was  deliv-
ered to Congress in December 2004.

The  NGATS  goals  and  objectives  broadly  address  eight  major  strategies.  A  series
of  eight  Integrated  Product  Teams  (IPT’s)  are  developing  executable  roadmaps  for
each  strategy  to  transform  the  National  Airspace  System.  The  eight  IPT’s  are  fo-
cused  on  such  activities  as  developing  alternative  airport  concepts  and  infrastruc-
ture to meet future demand, establishing a more effective and less intrusive airport
security  system  without  limiting  mobility  or  infringing  on  civil  liberties,  creating  a
more responsive air traffic system that can accommodate new and changing aircraft
vehicle  classes  and  business  models,  reducing  the  impact  of  weather  on  air  travel,
and harmonizing equipage and operations globally.

NASA has a major role in the JPDO and the Next Generation Air Transportation
System.  While  NASA  is  performing  aeronautics  research  that  provides  the  founda-
tion to enable NGATS and the right strategies, we are also providing civil servants
and direct support to the JPDO. NASA is providing civil service employees to serve
as  the  JPDO  Deputy  Director  (SES),  Agile  Air  Traffic  System  IPT  Lead  (SES),  and
a  Board  member  (SES),  as  well  as  11  other  full  or  part  time  civil  servants.  NASA
financial  support  to  the  JPDO  was  $5.4M  in  FY  2004.  This  has  increased  to  $5.6M
in  FY  2005  and  will  increase  to  $10M  in  FY  2006.  We  are  also  conducting  a  net-
work-enabled operations (NEO) demonstration of security and capacity related tech-
nologies.  This  demonstration,  jointly  sponsored  by  NASA,  DOD,  DHS,  and  DOT,
could  prove  to  be  valuable  in  integrating  government-wide  intelligence  operations,
providing significant aid to our national security.

In  aviation  there  has  never  been  a  transformation  effort  similar  to  this  one  with
as many stakeholders and as broad in scope. The objective of this plan is to provide
the  opportunity  for  creative  solutions  for  the  future  of  air  transportation,  our  secu-
rity,  and  our  hope  for  a  vibrant  future.  Its  success  is  the  first  priority  of  our  aero-
nautics portfolio.
Aeronautics Research Programs

The research in the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate programs supports
the  NASA  Strategic  Plan,  as  formulated  with  your  input  and  the  input  of  federal
agencies, industry and academia. The President’s FY 2006 Budget fully supports the
Aeronautics  program’s  vital  research,  especially  in  the  areas  of  reducing  aircraft

noise,  increasing  the  aviation  safety  and  security  and  increasing  the  capacity  and
efficiency of the National Airspace System. The budget request also supports the ac-
tivities  that  have  been  identified  by  the  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office.
NASA’s FY 2006 request for the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate is $852.3
million, which is $54 million less than the FY 2005 budget.

Protecting air travelers and the public is the focus of the Aviation Safety and Se-
curity Program (AvSSP) which develops technologies for both the National Aviation
System and aircraft that are aimed at preventing both intentional and unintentional
events  that  could  cause  damage,  harm,  and  loss  of  life;  and  minimizing  the  con-
sequences when these types of events occur. Aviation safety focuses on technologies
that  can  reduce  aircraft  accident  rates  and  reduce  aviation  injuries  and  fatalities.
Aviation  security  focuses  on  technologies  that  can  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  the
National Aviation System to terrorist attacks while improving the efficiency of secu-
rity  measures.  The  AvSSP  Program  also  develops  and  integrates  information  tech-
nologies  needed  to  assess  situations  and  trends  that  might  indicate  unsafe  or  inse-
cure conditions before they lead to fatalities or damage. The goal, in short, is to re-
duce  the  potential  for  loss  of  life  in  the  National  Aviation  System.  The  President’s
FY  2006  Budget  for  AvSSP  is  $192.9  million,  an  increase  of  four  percent  over  the
FY 2005 program.

Last  year  AvSSP  demonstrated  aviation  safety  breakthrough  technology  that  has
enormous  potential  to  eliminate  the  leading  cause  of  world-wide  commercial  and
general  aviation  fatalities,  Controlled  Flight  Into  Terrain  (commonly  referred  to  as
CFIT).  Synthetic  Visions  Systems  performed  simulation  and  flight-test  evaluations
of  low-cost  forward-fit  and  retrofit  technologies  for  General  Aviation  aircraft.  Syn-
thetic  Vision  Systems  create  an  artificial,  ‘‘virtual  view,’’  of  an  area  based  on  a  de-
tailed  terrain  database.  Although  the  pilot  may  not  be  able  to  see  the  ground
through  the  fog,  a  computer  screen  presents  the  landing  site  accurately  based  on
map  and  terrain  information.  Evaluations  included  technical  and  operational  per-
formance  assessments  of  improved  pilot  situational  awareness  with  regard  to  ter-
rain  portrayal,  loss  of  control  prevention,  and  display  symbology.  Results  from  our
demonstration  show  the  efficacy  of  synthetic  vision  displays  to  eliminate  CFIT  and
greatly improve pilot situational awareness.

Turbulence  is  a  leading  cause  of  in-flight  injuries  and  costs  the  airlines  at  least
$100 million per year. To address this issue, AvSSP has designed and is performing
in-service  evaluations  of  a  turbulence  prediction  and  warning  system  with  a  major
airline  that  gives  flight  crews  the  advanced  warning  needed  to  avoid  turbulence  or
advise  passengers  to  sit  down  and  buckle  up  to  avoid  injury.  AvSSP  is  also  devel-
oping  safety  design  and  maintenance  tools  to  design  safer  aircraft  that  can,  for  ex-
ample,  operate  more  safely  in  icing  conditions,  and  new  techniques  for  industry  to
improve aviation maintenance procedures that can improve safety and reduce main-
tenance-related accidents.

Working  in  concert  with  other  government  agencies  that  have  mission  require-
ments  in  aviation  safety  and  security,  such  as  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration
and  the  Transportation  Security  Administration,  as  well  as  in  cooperation  with  the
U.S.  aviation  industry  and  universities,  NASA  actively  pursues  technology  transfer
with these partners by identifying and addressing user needs and by demonstrating
key attributes of the technologies in relevant user environments, making use of both
NASA and partner facilities and capabilities.

Last year at the Ft. Worth, Texas, and Washington, D.C., Air Traffic Control Cen-
ters,  AvSSP  demonstrated  a  prototype  of  the  Rogue  Evaluation  And  Coordination
Tool  (REACT),  using  a  live  traffic  feed  over  eight  hours.  REACT  demonstrated  the
ability  to  detect  aircraft  that  are  deviating  from  their  expected  flight  paths  using
four  detection  algorithms.  It  also  predicted  incursions  into  restricted  airspace,  with
countdown  timers.  These  capabilities  will  enhance  the  public  safety  by  mitigating
the  potential  for  catastrophic  harm  that  might  otherwise  result  from  a  rogue  air-
craft.

Transferring technology to enable major increases in the capacity and mobility of
the  U.S.  air  transportation  system  is  the  focus  of  the  Airspace  Systems  Program
(ASP).  For  example,  the  Small  Aircraft  Transportation  System  (SATS)  has  dem-
onstrated  the  feasibility  of  pilots  safely  landing  at  non-radar  equipped  airports
under low visibility conditions. Also, SATS has demonstrated the use of automation
to  increase  flight-path  accuracy  and  situational  awareness,  precluding  the  need  for
expensive,  ground-based  systems.  In  2005,  we  are  conducting  a  number  of  SATS
demonstrations validating technologies that promote routine and easy access of gen-
eral  aviation  aircraft  to  the  Nation’s  under  utilized  small  airports.  SATS  tech-
nologies can help to relieve the current excessive demands on the Nation’s National
Airspace  System.  We  will  conduct  a  public  demonstration  of  our  accomplishments
in  Danville,  Virginia,  during  June  5–7,  2005.  I  extend  a  personal  invitation  to  all

the Members on this committee to attend this SATS demonstration. The President’s
FY  2006  Budget  for  ASP  is  $200.3  million,  an  increase  of  22  percent  over  the  FY
2005 program.

The Airspace Systems Program has become an essential provider of the FAA’s air
traffic  management  long-term  research.  The  FAA  long-term  forecast  indicates  a
steady  growth  in  air  travel  demand  that  will  culminate  in  a  doubling  of  that  de-
mand  over  roughly  the  next  two  decades.  NASA’s  ASP  research  objectives  are
planned  to  meet  the  FAA’s  needs  in  2025  though  some  priority  is  being  given  to
meet the FAA’s near-term operational support needs.

The  Virtual  Airspace  Modeling  and  Simulation  System,  developed  by  the  ASP,
provides  a  unique  and  critical  capability  that  is  used  to  perform  simulations  and
trade-off  assessments  of  future  air  transportation  system  concepts,  models,  and
technologies. This capability will allow an air traffic management tool concept to be
tested  in  a  non-operational  environment  before  major  development  dollars  are  in-
vested.  The  JPDO  currently  is  using  this  capability  to  assess  the  impact  of  new
technologies and to establish the requirements leading to a transformed national air
transportation system.

Last  year  we  successfully  completed  the  Advanced  Air  Transportation  Tech-
nologies  (AATT)  project  that  developed  Air  Traffic  Management  decision-making
technologies  and  procedures  to  enable  greater  flexibility  and  efficiencies  of  the  Na-
tional  Airspace  System.  In  congested  airspace  with  interdependent  traffic  flows,  a
delay  at  one  center  often  creates  a  domino  effect  that  spreads  quickly  to  multiple
centers.  Over  its  five-year  life,  the  AATT  project  developed  and  demonstrated  sev-
eral active decision support tools that would enable improvements in NAS through-
put,  user  flexibility,  predictability,  and  overall  system  efficiency  while  maintaining
safety.

The  Vehicle  Systems  Program  (VSP)  is  developing  and  demonstrating  barrier-
breaking vehicle concepts and technologies, beyond the scope of conventional air ve-
hicles  that  protect  the  Earth’s  environment  and  enable  science  missions.  In  FY
2005, the VSP was transformed into a goal-driven technology development program
aimed at the maturation of technologies to flight. By developing well-defined techno-
logical  metrics  and  goals,  the  diverse  technology  development  effort  was  refocused
in  over  seven  different  vehicle  classes.  Considering  our  current  constrained  budget
environment,  the  program  will  be  undergoing  a  second  stage  of  transformation  in
2006.  Three  basic  tenets  govern  this  transformation:  barrier-breaking  demonstra-
tions,  sharp  focus  on  fewer  goals,  and  fully  competed  awards.  The  2004  record-
breaking  Hyper-X  demonstrations,  which  I  described  at  the  beginning  of  my  testi-
mony,  illustrated  that  many  barriers  remain  in  the  second  century  of  flight.  The
transformed  Vehicle  Systems  investment  will  be  focused  on  achieving  these  dem-
onstrations  through  the  use  of  increased  competition  through  merit-based  research
selection. The President’s FY 2006 Budget for VSP is $459.1 million.

As  part  of  the  transformation  of  the  VSP,  we  have  consolidated  our  research  to

four specific ‘‘barrier-breaking’’ technology demonstration projects:

• Subsonic Noise Reduction: Continues the barrier breaking research for reduc-
ing  airport  noise,  a  demonstration  of  noise  reduction  technologies  for  large
transport  aircraft  will  put  us  halfway  to  the  goal  of  keeping  objectionable
noise within airport boundaries. This demonstration will include advanced en-
gine  and  airframe  noise  reduction  approaches  as  well  as  the  innovative  con-
tinuous  descent  approach  to  avoid  the  objectionable  changes  in  engine  speed
as an aircraft approaches the airport.
• Sonic  Boom  Reduction:  If  nothing  is  done  to  break  the  barrier  of  supersonic
flight over land, it will take just as long to fly across the country in the third
century  of  flight  as  it  did  halfway  through  the  first  century.  The  barrier  to
high-speed  flight  is  defining  a  sonic  boom  level  that  is  acceptable  to  the  gen-
eral  public,  and  designing  an  aircraft  to  reach  that  level.  Building  on  our  re-
cent successful flight validation of the theory that by altering the contours of
a supersonic aircraft, the shockwave and its accompanying sonic boom can be
shaped resulting in a greatly reduced sonic boom signature on the ground, we
plan  to  demonstrate  an  innovative  air  vehicle  that  will  break  the  barrier  of
acceptable supersonic flight.
• Zero  Emissions  Aircraft:  Conventional  turbo  machinery  powered  by  fossil
fuels  can  only  incrementally  address  the  need  to  reduce  harmful  NOΧ and
CO2 emissions  from  aircraft.  A  breakthrough  demonstration  of  an  all-electric
aircraft propulsion system will be the first step towards a truly emission-less
aircraft.
• High-Altitude,  Long-Endurance,  Remotely  Operated  Aircraft  (HALE  ROA):
NASA  opened  the  door  to  high  altitude  flight  when  it  successfully  dem-

onstrated  the  Helios.  This  legacy  will  be  extended  through  a  series  of  high-
altitude long-endurance aircraft that will extend duration, range, and payload
capacity.  The  first  breakthrough  will  be  a  14-day  duration  aircraft  that  flies
at over 50 thousand feet.

NASA Aeronautics Research Centers: Issues & Implications

Significant  NASA  organizational  and  programmatic  transformation,  based  upon
the  recommendations  of  the  President’s  Commission  on  the  Implementation  of
United  States  Space  Exploration  Policy,  is  essential  for  NASA.  As  discussed  above,
the transformation of NASA’s Aeronautics Research programs encompasses not only
the  technical  content  of  those  programs,  but  also  the  mechanisms  by  which  those
programs will be conducted. These changes are having major impacts on the people
and  facilities  at  NASA’s  four  centers  that  perform  aeronautics  research  for  the
Agency.  NASA  is  taking  proactive  steps  to  manage  the  impact  of  these  changes  on
our people and facilities. In particular, we are actively involved with several ongoing
Agency  initiatives,  including  the  Core  Competency  Assessment  and  the  Trans-
formation  Action  Team,  to  ensure  that  we  have  identified  the  workforce  skill  sets
that  are  critical  to  our  future  success.  We  have  also  established  viable  mechanisms
for  addressing  areas  where  we  anticipate  having  too  many,  or  too  few,  of  these
skills.  The  NASA  Organizational  Model  Assessment  Team,  established  in  response
to  a  recommendation  of  the  Aldridge  Commission,  identified  potential  alternate  or-
ganizational models for NASA Centers. The Agency is evaluating the possible imple-
mentation  of  alternate  organizational  models  including:  Hybrid  organizations,  com-
bining  a  Government  component  with  an  FFRDC,  University  Affiliated  Research
Center, Institute or Government Corporation.

Additionally, the Agency is examining a range of actions to address our workforce
issues. These include: voluntary separations-buyouts; job fairs and perhaps directed
inter-Center workforce rebalancing; acceleration of Center transformation strategies;
preparation  of  requests  for  demonstration  personnel  authorities;  and  as  a  last  re-
sort, preparation for involuntary measures.

Regarding our facilities, we are instituting a ‘‘corporate approach’’ to the manage-
ment  of  these  key  assets,  beginning  with  our  major  wind  tunnels.  NASA,  and  its
predecessor the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, has long used a vari-
ety of wind tunnels to support research, development, and related activities in both
its aeronautics and space endeavors. External users, particularly DOD and the aero-
space industry, have also used these facilities to meet their own research and devel-
opment  objectives.  During  the  past  decade,  however,  the  level  of  demand  for  most,
if  not  all,  of  these  facilities  has  decreased  substantially.  The  reduction  in  demand
within NASA has been the result of a gradual change in programmatic direction to-
ward  areas  such  as  airspace  operations,  aircraft  safety,  and  aircraft  security  that
by and large do not require significant wind tunnel usage. The reduction in demand
external to NASA has paralleled the decreasing number of new aircraft development
projects, both commercial and military.

As  a  result,  NASA  has  considerably  more  wind  tunnels  than  the  Agency’s  pro-
grams  require.  In  an  effort  to  match  program  requirements  with  supporting  infra-
structure,  NASA  has,  within  the  last  ten  years,  closed  about  half  of  its  wind  tun-
nels. Decisions regarding the operation, and closure, of specific facilities were made
primarily  by  the  Research  Center  that  operated  each  respective  facility.  Recently,
however,  the  nature  and  pace  of  change  within  and  external  to  the  Agency  has
made it increasingly difficult for the Centers to manage and operate such facilities,
particularly those with large fixed costs and uncertain levels of utilization.

Accordingly,  on  February  4,  2005,  ARMD,  operating  as  the  Headquarters  Center
Executive  responsible  for  the  Dryden  Flight  Research  Center,  the  Glenn  Research
Center, and the Langley Research Center, instituted a new ‘‘corporate management
of  facilities’’  approach,  effective  immediately.  Under  this  approach,  a  new  Head-
quarters  office  will  be  responsible  for  the  integrated,  strategic  management  of  all
the  major  wind  tunnels  within  the  Agency.  Specifically,  this  office  has  been  tasked
with establishing an overall strategy for this suite of facilities; for setting cost, pric-
ing,  and  top-level  facility  access  policies;  for  coordinating  overall  marketing  efforts;
for  approving  test  assignments;  assessing  program  and  facility  performance;  for
sponsoring  initiatives  for  improved  operational  effectiveness  and  efficiency;  and—
with respect to this set of facilities—for serving as the primary integrated interface
with industry, DOD, and other customers and stakeholders.

In particular, this new approach will enable us to better address many of the chal-
lenges facing the management of these facilities, including those highlighted by the
RAND  Corporation  in  their  recently  concluded  examination  of  NASA’s  wind  tunnel

Summary

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  I  appreciate  the
opportunity  to  testify  today  to  share  our  accomplishments  and  the  actions  we  are
taking  for  the  future  of  this  nation  in  aeronautics  research.  We  are  transforming
aeronautics at NASA to emphasize innovations in addressing barriers through high-
risk,  high-payoff  technologies.  Our  transformed  aeronautics  program  will  create
challenges and opportunities as we pursue the Vision for Space Exploration. We are
excited about this future, and we are anxious to get on with it.

BIOGRAPHY FOR J. VICTOR LEBACQZ

Dr.  Lebacqz  is  the  Associate  Administrator  for  Aeronautics  Research,  one  of  four
Mission  Directorates  within  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration
(NASA), a position he has held since July 2003. In this position, he has overall tech-
nical,  programmatic,  and  personnel  management  responsibility  for  all  aeronautics
technology  research  and  development  within  the  Agency.  The  programmatic  activi-
ties  are  funded  by  a  $1.0  Billion/year  budget  that  supports  three  major  NASA  pro-
grams, which are performed at the four Aeronautics research centers of Ames, Dry-
den,  Glenn,  and  Langley.  Personnel  oversight  of  approximately  6,200  civil  servants
at the four Aeronautics centers is a concomitant responsibility.

Prior  to  this  appointment,  Dr.  Lebacqz  was  the  Associate  Center  Director  for
Aerospace  Programs  at  the  NASA  Ames  Research  Center,  a  position  he  held  since
June  2002.  In  this  position,  he  had  overall  management  responsibility  for  the  con-
duct of programs led by Ames for the Office of Aerospace Technology within NASA.
These  programs  included  Airspace  Systems;  Rotorcraft;  Computing,  Information,
and  Communications  Technology;  and  Engineering  for  Complex  Systems.  They  had
a combined value of approximately $250M per year.

rotorcraft, 

Between May 2000 and May 2002, Dr. Lebacqz was Deputy Director of the Office
of  Aerospace  at  the  NASA  Ames  Research  Center.  The  Aerospace  Directorate’s  re-
search  and  technology  development  efforts  include  advanced  aerospace  projects,
space  transportation  and  thermal  protection  systems,  aviation  operations  systems,
nanotechnology, acoustics, basic and applied aerodynamics, and rotorcraft. The work
is  performed  in  seven  subordinate  Divisions  or  Offices  comprised  of  approximately
280  civil  servant  employees  and  235  contractors,  with  an  annual  budget  on  the
order of $75M. Dr. Lebacqz independently, or in partnership with the Director, was
responsible  for  all  personnel  and  financial  management  activities  associated  with
the  Directorate,  as  well  as  the  development  and  transfer  to  industry  and/or  other
government  organizations  of  advanced  air  traffic  management  and  flight  systems
technology,  and  of 
low-speed  aeromechanics,  and  hypersonic
aerothermodynamic technologies.

Prior  to  this  position,  Dr.  Lebacqz  was  Director  of  the  Aviation  System  Capacity
Program  and  the  Aerospace  Operations  Systems  Programs,  for  the  National  Aero-
nautics and Space Administration (NASA), a position he held since December 1997.
He  was  responsible  for  the  technical  and  programmatic  conduct  of  three  systems
technology projects (Advanced Air Transportation Technologies, Terminal Area Pro-
ductivity, and Short Haul Civil Tiltrotor) and one base research and technology pro-
gram  (Aerospace  Operations  Systems)  for  NASA.  These  programs  have  a  combined
value  of  approximately  $725M  over  five  years,  and  are  conducted  at  three  of  the
NASA  Centers:  Ames  Research  Center  in  California,  Langley  Research  Center  in
Virginia, and Glenn Research Center in Ohio. They focus on developing technologies
to  increase  the  capacity  and  safety  of  the  National  Airspace  System.  In  their  con-
duct,  he  was  also  responsible  for  strategic  alliances  with  the  Federal  Aviation  Ad-
ministration, and for developing formal relationships with the FAA’s Technical Cen-
ter and the DOT’s Volpe Transportation Center.

Previous  to  that  assignment,  Dr.  Lebacqz  was  Chief  of  the  Flight  Management
and Human Factors Division at NASA Ames, a position he held between December
1996 and December 1997. As Division Chief, he had technical and personnel respon-
sibility for 200 civil servant and contractor employees, with an annual budget of ap-
proximately $35M. He was specifically responsible for interdisciplinary Division pro-
grams in Air Traffic Management, Aeronautical Human Factors, and Aviation Safe-
ty  research.  Prior  to  this  appointment,  he  was  Deputy  Chief  of  the  same  Division
since  1994,  during  which  time  his  specific  responsibilities  also  included  Rotorcraft
Systems.  Concurrently,  he  was  Program  Manager  of  NASA’s  Rotorcraft  Base  Re-
search and Technology program from February 1996 until December 1996, with pro-

grammatic  responsibilities  for  the  entire  NASA  rotorcraft  program  at  the  same
three NASA Aeronautics Centers.

Between  1991  and  1994,  he  was  Chief  of  the  Flight  Human  Factors  Branch  at
NASA Ames. In this position, he was responsible for the development of human fac-
tors  programs  in  crew  resource  management,  fatigue  countermeasures,  and  air-
ground  integration.  Between  1985  and  1991  he  was  Chief  of  the  Flight  Dynamics
and  Controls  Branch  at  Ames,  where  he  was  responsible  for  programs  in  rotorcraft
and VSTOL stability, control, and handling qualities, and developed helicopter flight
research activities cooperative with the U.S. Army, including the new RASCAL UH–
60 helicopter. Concurrently, he was a lecturer at Stanford University between 1982
and 1992, teaching the graduate course ‘‘Dynamics and Control of Rotary-Wing Air-
craft.’’ From 1978 to 1985 he conducted flight and simulation research at Ames, and,
prior  to  that,  he  was  with  the  Calspan  Corporation  in  Buffalo,  NY,  where  he  was
Head, Flight Control Section.

His BSE (cum laude), MA, and Ph.D. degrees in Aeronautical Engineering are all
from  Princeton  University.  He  is  the  author  or  co-author  of  over  50  technical  re-
ports,  articles,  or  papers,  was  a  member  of  the  American  Helicopter  Society  (AHS),
and  is  a  Fellow  of  the  American  Institute  of  Aeronautics  and  Astronautics  (AIAA).
For  the  AHS,  he  has  been  Technical  Director  for  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Region
(1982–1983), as well as Technical Chairman for an International Conference on Fly-
ing Qualities and Human Factors in 1993. For the AIAA, he has been an Associate
Editor  for  the  Journal  of  Guidance,  Control,  and  Dynamics  (1982–1987),  a  member
of  the  Technical  Committee  for  Guidance  and  Control  (1988–1991),  and  the  Deputy
Director,  Aircraft  Operations,  for  the  Aircraft  Technology  Integration  and  Oper-
ations  Technical  Group.  He  was  the  Technical  Chairperson  for  the  first  AIAA  Air-
craft Technology Integration and Operations Forum in November 2001.

Dr. Lebacqz has received two individual NASA Special Achievement Awards, five
NASA  Group  Achievement  Awards,  six  NASA  ‘‘Turning  Goals  Into  Reality’’  (TGIR)
awards, two NASA Ames Honor Awards (for excellence in supervision and for men-
toring),  the  U.S.  Army  Aeroflightdynamics  Directorate  Director’s  Award  for  Inter-
agency  Cooperation,  the  NASA  Exceptional  Service  Medal,  and  has  twice  been
awarded  NASA’s  Outstanding  Leadership  Medal.  He  was  named  a  Presidential
Rank Award Meritorious Executive in 2003. He is listed in the Lexington Who’s Who
Registry 2000–2001.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman. Next, Dr. Klineberg,

you are recognized for five minutes.

STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN M. KLINEBERG, COMMITTEE

CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL

Dr.  KLINEBERG.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  Members  of  the
Committee.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  you
today.

I  have  some  prepared—get  there  on  the  screen.  I  am  appearing
today  as  the  Chair  of  the  Aeronautics  and  Space  Engineering
Board’s  Committee  to  Review  the  NASA  Aeronautics  Program.  I
have  submitted  a  written  report  that  covers  that  in—completely.  I
am  going  to  try  to  hit  some  highlights  here,  and  I  will  be  as  brief
as I can.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Your  full  testimony  will  be  entered  into  the

Mr. KLINEBERG. Thank you very much.
Particularly,  the  process  I  want  to  emphasize,  we  had  a  large
number of very senior, very experienced people in the industry who
reviewed,  at  length,  the  NASA  aeronautics  program  during  2003,
and the names of my fellow panel members are in the written sub-
mittal.

I  would  just  highlight  several  of  the  recommendations  we  came
up with. This first one is something that I am sure this committee
could—will  endorse.  It  says  that  air  transportation  is  vital  to  this
country.  But  behind  this  statement  is—was  a  consternation  my

record.

committee  found  that  NASA,  the  people  in  the  NASA  aeronautics
program  did  not  seem  to  have  a  good  handle  on  why  they  were
doing the work they were doing, and Mr. Kucinich touched on this
earlier, the problem is the vision, the NASA Vision Statement says
that  their  mission  is  to  understand  and  protect  the  home  planet,
and  that  is  the  aegis,  the  vision  under  which  aeronautics  is  con-
tained  in  the  NASA  thinking,  and  frankly,  that  is  completely
wrong. That is not the vision for aeronautics. It is an issue of com-
petitiveness,  and  the  vitality  of  the  air  transportation  system,  and
this has to be understood in NASA. And I will touch on that a little
more later, if I may.

Another  one,  we  said,  we  looked  around,  and  we  said  NASA  is
the  agency  that  must  provide  that  leadership,  and  particularly,  in
research  and  development,  and  I  don’t  think  you  will  find  argu-
ments  here,  but  we  needed—we  felt  we  needed  to  re-emphasize
that,  because  that  leadership  role  is  not  always  exercised,  and  it
needs to be exercised in having a strategic plan and a strategic vi-
sion that the rest of the players can unite behind.

We found NASA remarkably healthy, considering the tremendous
pressures  that  they  have  been  under,  in  budget  pressures.  And
their  facilities  are  world  class  national  facilities.  There  are  some
very, very good people out there, that are working at it. They need
a  little  focus  in  those  focus  programs,  a  little  more  focus,  but  we
found the program still is salvageable.

They  have  absorbed,  on  this  chart,  they  have  absorbed  a  lot  of
cuts  by  decreasing  the  number  of  people  they  have  in  given  areas.
That  is  a  natural  tendency,  but  we  felt  that  unless  they  can  build
up the budget, it is time, now, to look at dropping research in cer-
tain areas, because you simply don’t have the people that can sup-
port  that  activity.  At  the  same  time  that  they  need  to  focus  their
systems activities, we saw a real problem in that they backed away
from  long-term  basic  research,  and  NASA  and  NACA  before  it  has
traditionally been the home of a competence in aeronautics that we
are  worried  has  disappeared,  as  they  have  no  line  item  and  no-
where,  place,  to  support  basic  research,  unless  it  is  focused  on  a
given system, and that is not really what aeronautics is about. And
that is my—that was recommendation 7.

This  recommendation  8,  we  recognize  that  much  of  NASA  facili-
ties  did  grow  up  at  a  time  when  there  was  a  very  large  industrial
base in this country. That has consolidated, and NASA has to con-
tinue  to  look  at  consolidating  facilities,  but  they  need  to  do  this
carefully,  and  only  close  down  those  facilities  that  are  truly  not
needed or redundant in some way.

And  the  last  one  I  wanted  to  touch  on  this  morning,  is  we  felt
there  could  be  better,  NASA  could  do  a  little  bit  better  in  dealing
with  their  customers,  the  other  agencies,  the  FAA,  DOD,  and  oth-
ers. And the second bullet down here is code a little bit, and I will
touch  on  that  in  a  second,  we  felt  that  we  needed  some  way  to  in-
volve  the  NASA  Administrator  in  the  aeronautics  enterprise,  and
one  way  might  be  to  have  him  recognize  that  aeronautics  is,  in-
deed,  a  very  important,  separate  function  of  NASA,  and  needs  to
be supported that way.

And  essentially,  in  this  way  of  co-chairing  a  meeting  with  the
FAA  Administrator  is  a  way  to  enforce  that  kind  of  feeling.  Now,

if  you  will  permit  me  just  half  a  second,  I  would  like  to  address
the  four  specific  questions  I  was  asked  verbally.  I  have  no  charts
on that. And I will be as quickly as I can, Mr. Chairman.

The first question, now, I need to inform you that I have to take
off  my  hat  as  the  representative  of  the  National  Academies,  and  I
am  now  speaking  to  you  as  a  private  citizen,  a  concerned  private
citizen,  but  one  with  over  45  years  experience  in  this  field.  So,  I
hope what I say will be useful.

The  first  question  was  what  are  the  main  challenges  facing  us
over the next two decades, and what are the Nation’s most pressing
strategic  needs?  I  know  my  colleagues  will  address  this  in  detail,
so I am not going to go into that now, but in my mind, we are very
close  to  letting  the  aeronautics  infrastructure  become  a  chokepoint
for  economic  growth  in  this  country.  And  not  only  exports  of  aero-
nautical  systems  and  equipment  and  subsystems  that  we  have
talked about earlier, but the air traffic system itself in this country
is  becoming  saturated.  We  had  some  relief  after  9/11,  when  the
growth  in  air  traffic  slowed  temporarily.  It  is  starting  to  pick  up
again, and we are going to get into a point very soon when you just
can’t—it  will  be  unreliable.  You  won’t  be  able  to  travel  from  point
A to point B, and for those of us who live in California and use the
Internet, for example, for commerce, and expect packages to appear
at  our  door,  that  is  going  to  be—that  will  just  be  a  disaster,  and
this country has got to support that infrastructure, and we have to
start  to  plan  for  the  next  generation  of  air  traffic  control  systems,
and  the  vehicles  and  systems  that  will  fly  in  that.  And  I  want  to
note here that the National Academies and the ASAB hopes to con-
duct  a  study  that  will  help  a  bit  in  this  area,  by  developing  what
we  call  a  decadal  strategy  for  aeronautics  research,  that  will  help
identify  the  major  issues  and  what  is  being  done  to  address  them.
The  next  question  was  what  is  NASA’s  role,  and  how  effective
are NASA’s programs. I think I have touched on that, because that
is what our study did. The mechanisms for NASA aeronautics have
been in place since 1917. They grew a lot during the Second World
War, and they are very effective. And I think that funding R&D is
an  effective  way  for  the  government  to  support  this  field,  and  it  is
much  better  than  government  subsidies,  and  as  I  say,  we  found  a
good program in place, in spite of the debilitating budget cuts that
have been proposed.

The  third  question  I  was  asked  is  what  effect  will  the  proposed
budget  have  on  NASA’s  ability  to  carry  out  this  program.  I  think
the  budget  is  a  disaster,  unmitigated.  And  if  you  look  at  the  aero
budget,  it  has  declined  by  more  than  half  over  the  last  several
years.  The  five-year  runout  contemplates  an  additional  20  percent
reduction  in  the  budget.  I  think  this  program  is  on  its  way  to  be-
coming  irrelevant  to  the  future  of  aeronautics  in  this  country,  and
perhaps—and in the world.

And what do I think NASA should do? I thought a lot about this.
Representative  Davis  touched  on  this  in  her  opening  statements.  I
think somehow, I think NASA aeronautics belongs in NASA. NASA
is  an  R&D  agency,  it  is  kind  of  special  in  the  government.  I  don’t
believe  we  need  a  new  organization  that  would  involve  the  oper-
ational agencies like the FAA or DOD, but I think NASA itself has
to pay attention to aeronautics, and one thought I have had is that

NASA  needs  two  Deputy  Administrators,  one  for  aeronautics  and
for  space,  both  of  which  would  have  advise  and  consent  screening,
and you would have an Administrator, a Deputy Administrator for
NASA  aeronautics,  and  I  think—I  approve  of  the  notion  of  not  al-
lowing transfer across the budget line items. NASA aeronautics has
a very different constituency——

Chairman CALVERT. Doctor, if you will summarize.
Dr. KLINEBERG. I am—the last second, sir.
The—NASA  has  a  different  constituency  in  aeronautics  than
space. It is very hard to trade the two off, and it shouldn’t be—we
should  fix  that  somehow.  So,  that  concludes  my  testimony,  Mr.
Chairman.  I  am  sorry  I  ran  a  little  bit  long,  but  I  appreciate  your
attention.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Klineberg follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN M. KLINEBERG
An Assessment of NASA’s Aeronautics Technology Program

Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Udall,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  op-
portunity  to  testify  before  you  today.  My  name  is  John  Klineberg.  I  have  recently
retired  from  my  position  as  the  President  of  Space  Systems/Loral  and  served  for
over 25 years in a variety of management and technical positions with NASA. I ap-
pear  before  you  today  in  my  capacity  as  Chair  of  the  National  Research  Council’s
committee  assessing  NASA’s  aeronautics  technology  programs.  The  Research  Coun-
cil  is  the  operating  arm  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  National  Academy  of
Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, chartered by
Congress  in  1863  to  advise  the  government  on  matters  of  science  and  technology.
In  late  2002,  the  National  Research  Council  was  asked  by  NASA  and  the  Office
of  Management  and  Budget  to  examine  the  technical  quality  of  its  aeronautics  re-
search  and  development.  The  National  Research  Council  formed  our  committee
under  the  auspices  of  the  Aeronautics  and  Space  Engineering  Board  to  respond  to
this request. Our committee’s report was released in November of 2003.

I am aware that NASA’s program has been changing since our report was issued
and that it will continue to change. However, the following material summarizes the
findings and recommendations of our report as it was issued in November 2003.
OVERVIEW

The  National  Research  Council  (NRC)  of  the  National  Academies  performed  this
detailed,  independent  assessment  of  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Technology  Programs  by
establishing three panels, one for each of the component programs within the Aero-
nautics  Technology  Programs.  The  NRC  also  established  a  parent  committee,  con-
sisting  of  the  Chairman  and  a  subset  of  members  from  each  panel.  The  committee
and panels began their activities in early 2003.

The  three  subordinate  panels  conducted  an  independent  peer  assessment  of  the
Vehicle  Systems  Program  (VSP),  the  Airspace  Systems  Program  (ASP),  and  the
Aviation  Safety  Program  (AvSP),  the  three  elements  of  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Tech-
nology  Programs.  The  committee  and  panels  were  asked  by  NASA  to  address  four
questions:

1. Is the array of activities about right?
2. Is there a good plan to carry out the program?
3. Is the program doing what it set out to do?
4. Is the entire effort connected to the users?

The  committee  developed  findings  and  recommendations  at  three  different  levels.
At  the  top  level,  it  created  a  list  of  12  key  crosscutting  recommendations  for  the
overall  Aeronautics  Technology  Programs  on  issues  that  span  the  entire  set  of  pro-
grams.  These  recommendations  are  appropriate  for  guiding  Congress,  NASA  Head-
quarters, and the White House in prioritizing NASA’s aeronautics research and de-
velopment programs. At the second level of detail, the committee provided program-
level recommendations appropriate for program and project managers at the NASA
Research  Centers.  Finally,  the  committee  developed  findings  and  recommendations
at  the  task  level  that  are  designed  to  assist  the  individual  principal  investigators
in  improving  the  quality  of  their  research.  These  third-level  recommendations  are
numerous and detailed and are not included in this document.

OVERALL ASSESSSMENT

The  committee’s  simple  answer  to  the  four  questions  posed  by  NASA  is  that,  in
general,  the  Aeronautics  Technology  programs  are  very  good  but  could  be  greatly
improved  by  following  the  committee’s  12  top-level  recommendations.  The  array  of
research  activities  is  about  right,  although  a  few  additions  and  deletions  are  rec-
ommended  in  various  areas.  There  are  good  plans  to  carry  out  the  programs  and
they  are  accomplishing  much  of  what  they  were  established  to  do,  but  with  some
changes in the plans for execution results could improve results significantly. In ad-
dition, the programs are reasonably well connected to the users, but here again the
committee recommends some improvements. These issues—scope, planning, achieve-
ment, and ties to users—are addressed more completely in the specific recommenda-
tions themselves:
Top-Level Recommendation 1. The government should continue to support
air transportation, which is vital to the U.S. economy and the well-being of
its citizens.

A  strong  national  program  of  aeronautics  research  and  technology  contributes  to
the vitality of the U.S. aeronautics industry, the efficiency of the U.S. air transpor-
tation  system,  and  the  economic  well-being  and  quality  of  life  of  people  in  the
United  States.  The  government  has  an  important  role  in  assuring  the  best  possible
air  transportation  system  and  the  development  of  related  technologies  that  enable
products  and  services  to  compete  effectively  in  the  global  marketplace.  This  is  con-
sistent  with  the  legislative  charter  for  NASA,  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space
Act  of  1958,  as  amended.  The  Act  specifies  that  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  and
technology  development  should  ‘‘contribute  to  a  national  technology  base  that  will
enhance  United  States  preeminence  in  civil  and  aeronautical  aviation  and  improve
the safety and efficiency of the United States air transportation system.’’
Top-Level  Recommendation  2.  NASA  should  provide  world  leadership  in
aeronautics research and development.

To  provide  leadership,  NASA  should  develop  consistent  strategic  and  long-range
plans  to  focus  the  aeronautics  program  in  areas  of  national  importance.  NASA
should have well-formulated, measurable, attainable goals at all program levels. To
be meaningful, goals should be based on a sound evaluation of future needs, techno-
logical feasibility, and relevant economic and other non-technical factors.
Top-Level  Recommendation  3.  NASA  has  many  excellent  technical  per-
sonnel  and  facilities  to  achieve  its  aeronautics  technology  objectives  but
should improve its processes for program management.

Many  NASA  facilities  are  world  class  national  assets.  In  addition,  the  committee
was  impressed  with  the  technical  expertise  of  many  program  personnel.  To  maxi-
mize  these  assets,  NASA  needs  to  improve  its  program  management  and  systems
integration  processes,  including  integration  across  programs.  In  particular,  NASA
should assure clear lines of responsibility and accountability. The use of matrix and
line  management  reporting  structures  sometimes  obscures  lines  of  accountability,
and  subproject  and  task-level  plans,  funding,  goals,  metrics,  staffing,  and  responsi-
bility are often difficult to define or cannot be clearly traced back to a plan or vision
for  the  program  as  a  whole.  Further,  NASA  should  use  independent  quality  assur-
ance  processes  for  program  evaluation,  and  all  projects  should  be  evaluated  on  a
regular basis to determine whether continued investment is warranted.
Top-Level  Recommendation  4.  NASA  should  eliminate  arbitrary  time  con-
straints on program completion and schedule key milestones based on task
complexity and technology maturity.

Research  priorities,  funding,  and  organizational  structure  change  during  the
course  of  any  research  and  development  effort.  However,  NASA  should  resist  con-
stant changes and realignments designed to meet artificial five-year sunset require-
ments.  Several  long-term  research  efforts  have  been  disguised  as  a  series  of  five-
year  projects  with  different  names  so  that  it  is  not  easy  to  trace  the  real  progress
of  the  research.  In  addition,  the  continuous  reorganization  and  restructuring  that
occur  in  response  to  the  five-year  sunset  rule  create  an  unstable  atmosphere  that
does  not  permit  NASA  researchers  to  pursue  the  best  path  to  technology  matura-
tion. NASA programs need clear exit criteria at the task level that specify when re-
search is complete or ready for transition to industry or other agencies.
Top-Level Recommendation 5. NASA should reduce the number of tasks in
its aeronautics technology portfolio.

NASA is trying to do too much within the available budget and resists eliminating
programs  in  the  face  of  budget  reductions.  Often,  there  are  too  many  tasks  to
achieve  research  objectives  in  key  areas.  This  overload  may  be  partly  the  result  of
including various research tasks within more focused efforts. The committee is con-
cerned that breadth of activities is coming at the expense of depth.
Top-Level  Recommendation  6.  NASA  should  pursue  more  high-risk,  high-
payoff technologies.

Many  innovative  concepts  that  are  critical  to  meeting  aviation  needs  in  the  next
decades  will  not  be  pursued  by  industry  or  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration
(FAA).  NASA  should  fill  this  void.  The  committee  applauds  the  inclusion  of  high-
risk,  revolutionary  sub-projects  in  many  areas  and  believes  the  program  portfolio
could benefit from additional far-reaching efforts with the potential for high payoff.
This type of research is critical to investigating the feasibility of innovative concepts
and reducing risk to the point where the concepts are suitable for advanced develop-
ment and transfer to industry or the FAA.
Top-Level  Recommendation  7.  NASA  should  reconstitute  a  long-term  base
research  program,  separate  from  the  other  aeronautics  technology  pro-
grams and projects.

The  current  research  is  mostly  product-driven,  with  not  enough  fundamental
work.  Fundamental  research  is  crucial  for  the  development  of  future  products.
NASA  needs  to  provide  researchers  the  opportunity  to  conduct  forward-looking,
basic research that is unencumbered by short-term, highly specified goals and mile-
stones. Historically, NASA has been a world leader in its core research areas; how-
ever, that base has eroded in recent years as the amount of in-house basic research
diminishes. NASA needs to reassess its core competencies and assure their support
through a base research program.
Top-Level  Recommendation  8.  NASA’s  aeronautics  technology  infrastruc-
ture exceeds its current needs, and the Agency should continue to dispose
of under-utilized assets and facilities.

NASA  test  facilities  create  large  fixed  costs.  Some  of  these  facilities  are  not
unique, and long-term fixed costs could be reduced through consolidation and deacti-
vation.  This  should  be  an  ongoing  effort  as  the  needs  of  the  industry  change  and
as validated computational tools reduce or eliminate the need for some experimental
facilities.
Top-Level Recommendation 9. NASA should implement full-cost accounting
in  a  way  that  avoids  unintended  consequences  harmful  to  the  long-term
health of the aeronautics program.

NASA is in the process of transitioning from a net accounting system to one that
uses full-cost accounting. Under the former scheme, researchers managed only costs
directly  related  to  research  and  development.  In  full-cost  accounting,  all  project
costs  are  included  in  the  project  budget,  including  institutional  infrastructure  costs
such  as:  research  operations  support;  direct  procurement;  direct  civil  service  work-
force, benefits, and travel; service pools; center general and administrative; and cor-
porate general and administrative. The committee is concerned that, if not carefully
managed, full-cost accounting could result in (1) the closure of critical infrastructure
and  special-purpose  facilities  that  will  be  needed  for  future  program  execution  and
(2)  a  disincentive  to  use  large-scale  facilities  and  flight  tests  to  fully  demonstrate
technology readiness. This can easily occur if the responsibility for preserving insti-
tutional capabilities is delegated to lower level project managers. These project man-
agers  will  also  tend  to  avoid  full-scale  flight  tests  or  wind  tunnel  tests  in  order  to
conserve  their  project  budgets,  since  under  full-cost  accounting  much  of  the  cost  of
the testing infrastructure will be billed directly to their projects if they perform such
tests.  The  testing  infrastructure  will  be  underutilized  and  will  not  generate  the  re-
sources  needed  to  sustain  it.  The  committee  recommends  that  basic  research  costs
should  be  carried  as  a  line  item  and  not  hidden  in  larger  projects  and.  that  large
infrastructure costs, such as wind tunnels and full-scale flight testing, should be at-
tributed to the total program and accounted for accordingly.
Top-Level  Recommendation  10.  NASA  should  develop  a  common  under-
standing with the FAA of their respective roles and relationship.

NASA’s  airspace  research  ultimately  benefits  manly  government,  industry  and
private  organizations  with  an  interest  in  aviation,  including  the  Department  of  De-
fense (DOD), airlines, manufacturers, system operators (air traffic controllers, man-
agers,  flight  dispatchers  and  pilots),  and  the  flying  public.  Practically  speaking,

76

however,  the  most  important  customers  are  the  senior  managers  at  the  FAA,  at
other  government  agencies,  and  in  industry  who  decide  whether  they  will  take  ap-
plied  research  products  from  NASA  and  continue  their  development  to  the  point  of
incorporating  them  in  operational  systems.  Although  much  of  NASA’s  airspace  re-
search  is  applicable  to  systems  acquired  and  operated  by  DOD,  other  government
agencies,  and  industry,  most  of  it  is  intended  for  application  to  civil  aviation  sys-
tems  acquired,  operated  and/or  certified  by  the  FAA.  In  this  sense,  customers  also
include  the  many  other  organizations  and  officials  who  influence  decisions  by  the
government  and  industry  regarding  the  advanced  development  of  new  systems  for
civil application.

NASA and the FAA often collaborate at the technical level but there is a real need
for  more  effective  management  coordination.  The  need  for  continued  improvement
in  NASA  interactions  with  its  customers  is  indicated,  in  part,  by  the  committee’s
observation that NASA officials seem to perceive interactions with the FAA as more
effective than do many FAA managers. NASA officials need to recognize that imple-
mentation decisions rest with FAA management (for systems to be implemented by
the  FAA)  and  advocacy  by  NASA,  when  it  runs  counter  to  FAA  implementation
plans, is not helpful. Problems in this area are exacerbated by (1) the view of many
NASA personnel that the success of their research is measured only in terms of the
extent  to  which  customers  incorporate  NASA  research  in  operational  systems,  and
(2) competition that may arise between NASA and other organizations that conduct
research  on  behalf  of  the  FAA  or  other  key  customers.  As  as  particular  NASA  re-
search effort approaches the point where the value of continued development is con-
tingent on operational implementation, the prospective user may decide that imple-
mentation is not feasible., NASA should be willing to close out the project that has
no future and use the resources to support other research.
Top-Level  Recommendation  11.  NASA  should  seek  better  feedback  from
senior management in industry and other government organizations.

NASA’s  customers  include  aircraft  manufacturers,  operators,  airlines  and  the
FAA.  NASA  already  involves  customers  in  almost  all  of  its  research—for  example,
in  the  form  of  joint  efforts  with  the  FAA  to  take  research  products  into  the  field
for  testing.  Some  projects,  such  as  Small  Aircraft  Transportation  Systems  (SATS),
also sponsor wide-ranging outreach efforts. Usually, however, customer involvement
earlier  in  the  process  would  be  beneficial.  Early  involvement  would  (1)  ensure  that
researchers  understand  and  are  able  to  respond  to  user  requirements  and  concerns
as early as possible, and (2) probably increase customer buy-in. Customers need not
and should not be given veto authority over NASA research, but researchers should
be  aware  of—and  research  plans  should  account  for—objections  or  concerns  that
customers  raise.  This  is  especially  important  for  research  intended  to  provide  oper-
ationally  useful  products  capable  of  meeting  specific  functional  requirements,  but
early  consultations  with  user  would  also  be  beneficial  in  a  base  research  program.
NASA should improve its relationships with the FAA and other customers by involv-
ing  them  from  the  early  stages  of  the  research  and  development  process  through
field  implementation.  One  method  for  improving  interaction  would  be  for  NASA  to
convene  a  yearly  meeting,  co-chaired  by  the  FAA  and  NASA  Administrators,  with
participation  by  industry  executives  at  the  chief  operating  officer  level  and  senior
managers  from  other  federal  agencies  (e.g.,  Department  of  Transportation,  Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, and DOD). Topics should be limited to near-term issues
and implementation plans, and such a meeting should not be held unless the NASA
and FAA Administrators and industry chief operating officers will commit to person-
ally attending.
Top-Level Recommendation 12. NASA should conduct research in selective
areas relevant to rotorcraft.

Rotorcraft  are  an  important  constituent  of  air  transportation.  Many  of  the  re-
search  projects  currently  under  way  in  the  Aeronautics  Technology  Programs,  such
as synthetic vision and human factors, would be directly relevant to rotorcraft, with
only  minimal  additional  investment.  NASA  could  make  a  significant  impact  in
under-researched  areas  of  rotorcraft  such  as  decision  aids,  synthetic  vision,  pilot
workload,  and  situational  awareness.  Further,  the  existing  U.S.  Army  programs  in
rotorcraft technologies and industry research and development in rotorcraft could be
leveraged by NASA to meet civilian needs in the area. The committee believes that
research in civil applications of rotorcraft will not be conducted elsewhere in govern-
ment  or  industry  and  that  NASA’s  decision  to  discontinue  rotorcraft  research  has
left  critical  civilian  needs  unaddressed.  Therefore,  NASA  should  consider  potential
applications to rotorcraft in its research programs in general aviation and transport
aircraft.

SUMMARY

The  first  two  top-level  recommendations  reiterate  the  importance  of  air  transpor-
tation  and  of  NASA’s  role  in  the  research  and  development  process.  Top-level  rec-
ommendations 3–7 suggest ways the content and/or structure of the programs could
be improved, and 8 and 9 identify near-term important concerns that should be ad-
dressed.  The  final  three  top-level  recommendations  address  the  relationships  be-
tween NASA and its customers. The committee believes that NASA can improve and
strengthen its Aeronautics Technology Programs by following this advice.
SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT OF THE VEHICLE SYSTEMS PROGRAM

The Vehicle Systems Program contains seven projects:

• Breakthrough  Vehicle  Technologies.  Develops  high-risk,  high-payoff  tech-
nologies  to  dramatically  and  substantially  improve  vehicle  efficiency  and
emissions.
• Quiet Aircraft Technology. Discovers, develops, and verifies, in the laboratory,
technologies that improve quality of life by reducing society’s exposure to air-
craft noise.
• Twenty-First  Century  Aircraft  Technology  Project.  Develops  and  validates,
through  ground-based  experiments,  the  aerodynamic,  structural,  and  electric
power  technologies  that  will  reduce  by  20  percent  the  fuel  burn  and  carbon
dioxide emissions from future subsonic transport aircraft.
• Advanced  Vehicle  Concepts.  Develops  advanced  vehicle  concepts  and  configu-
• Flight  Research.  Tests  and  validates  technologies  and  tools  developed  by

propulsion concepts, and fundamental propulsion and power technologies that
would decrease emissions and increase mobility.

NASA in a realistic flight environment.

The  committee  noted  that  VSP  has  a  clear  mission  statement  with  a  set  of  fully
linked  goals  and  products,  but  it  believes  that  NASA  needs  a  better  understanding
of  the  core  competencies  required  to  meet  these  goals.  The  committee  also  believes
that  the  current  investment  strategy  of  VSP  appears  to  be  ad  hoc,  with  too  many
unprioritized  projects  and  tasks  and  no  apparent  methodology  to  determine  which
areas will provide the greatest benefit. The committee recommends that NASA iden-
tify and prioritize technologies with respect to their potential benefit to aviation.

The  committee  was  concerned  that  the  recent  transition  to  full-cost  accounting
will  have  an  unintended  effect  on  certain  facilities  and  infrastructure  that  are  na-
tional assets and will compromise the research program by reducing the number of
full-scale tests for concept validation.

The committee was concerned that NASA does not always get the benefit of indus-
try  involvement  at  the  appropriate  management  level  and  suggests  that  NASA  re-
examine the composition of its advisory groups.

The committee evaluated a total of 172 tasks in the VSP portfolio. The committee
determined  that  more  than  80  percent  were  of  good  quality  or  better,  with  30  per-
cent  (51  tasks)  rated  as  world-class.  The  committee  identified  91  tasks  that  were
good quality, 6 that were marginal, and 24 that were poor and should be redirected.
SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT OF THE AIRSPACE SYSTEMS PROGRAM

The ASP is organized into four projects:

• Advanced  Air  Transportation  Technologies.  Develops  air  traffic  management
tools  to  improve  the  capacity  of  transport  aircraft  operations  at  and  between
major airports.
• Virtual  Airspace  Modeling  and  Simulation.  Develops  models  and  simulations
to conduct trade-off analyses of concepts and technologies for future air trans-
portation systems.
• Small Air Transportation Systems. Develops and demonstrates technologies to
improve  public  mobility  through  increased  use  of  local  and  regional  airports.
• Airspace  Operations  Systems.  Develops  better  understanding,  models,  and
tools  to  enhance  the  efficient  and  safe  operation  of  aviation  systems  by
human operators.

The  committee  was  concerned  that  NASA’s  ASP  research  was  generally  too  fo-
cused  on  short-term,  incremental  payoff  work.  NASA  should  plan  ASP  research

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:40 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 020007 PO 00000 Frm 00081 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\031605\20007 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

78

based  on  a  top-down  understanding  of  the  air  transportation  system.  Research
should focus on areas of greatest payoff—that is, areas that relieve choke points and
other constraints to a more efficient air transportation system.

The committee noted that many existing airspace research tasks will not be com-
pleted  before  the  expiration  of  the  projects  under  which  they  are  currently  funded.
NASA  is  establishing  a  new  project,  NASA  Exploratory  Technologies  for  the  Na-
tional Airspace System (NAS)—NExTNAS—to continue some ongoing research tasks
and start some new tasks. The committee recommends that NASA incorporate many
ongoing tasks in the NExTNAS project so they can be completed.

The  committee  determined  that  the  ASP  also  should  support  basic  research  rel-
evant to long-term objectives and other research with a far-sighted vision. More spe-
cifically, the committee observed that the portfolio was primarily directed at improv-
ing  ground-based  air  traffic  management.  The  committee  recommends  that  NASA
continue distributed air-ground research for autonomous separation, with increased
effort on the airborne side.

The committee developed a series of findings and recommendations regarding the
FAA-NASA  relationship.  First,  the  committee  noted  that  two  different  tools,  Re-
search Management Plans and Research Transition Plans, were being used to facili-
tate  the  transition  of  technology  from  NASA  to  the  FAA.1 The  committee  believes
that  there  are  worthwhile  elements  in  the  Research  Transition  Plans  that  could  be
included  in  Research  Management  Plans.  In  addition,  NASA  and  FAA  program  di-
rectors  should  vigorously  adhere  to  the  Research  Management  Plan  process,  with
reviews  and  updates  at  regular  intervals.  If  either  agency  determines  that  the  re-
search  results  will  not  be  implemented,  the  Research  Management  Plan  should  be
canceled  and  NASA  should  formally  reassess  the  merits  of  continuing  to  develop  a
product that will not improve the operation of the NAS.

The  committee  also  had  recommendations  about  how  NASA  should  measure  the
success  of  its  research.  Currently,  it  tends  to  view  success  in  terms  of  the  ability
to  mature  technology  and  get  the  FAA  to  implement  it  for  operational  use.  Some
FAA  users,  however,  believe  this  view  of  success  leads  NASA  to  focus  too  much  on
implementation  issues,  which  NASA  may  not  be  qualified  to  address  given  its  lim-
ited  operational  experience.  The  committee  recommends  that  NASA  and  the  FAA
develop a common definition of what constitutes the successful completion of an ap-
plied ASP research task. Success of NASA applied research tasks should not be de-
fined solely in terms of implementation.
SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT OF THE AVIATION SAFETY PROGRAM

The AvSP consists of three projects:

• Vehicle  Safety  Technology.  Strengthens  aircraft  to  mitigate  vehicle  system
and  component  failures,  loss  of  control,  loss  of  situational  awareness,  and
post-crash or in-flight fires.

• Weather  Safety  Technology.  Researches  and  develops  technologies  to  reduce

the frequency and severity of weather-related accidents and injuries.

• System Safety Technology. Reduces the frequency and severity of aviation ac-
cidents and incidents by proactively managing risk in a systemwide approach.
The  committee  found  several  examples  of  work  of  outstanding  quality  in  AvSP,
notably the Aircraft Icing subproject (Weather Safety), the Crew Training task (Sys-
tem Safety), the Structures Health Management subtask (Vehicle Safety), the Mode
Confusion  subtask  (Vehicle  Safety),  and  scale-model  development  and  testing  work
(Vehicle Safety).

The  committee  was  concerned  about  recent  changes  it  observed  in  the  quality  of
the human factors research in AvSP, partly because the number of in-house human
factors personnel was decreasing and those who remained were primarily managing
the  work  of  contractors.  In  addition,  the  committee  noted  that  human  factors  work
did  not  appear  to  be  well-integrated  across  the  program.  The  committee  rec-
ommends  that  AvSP  strengthen  in-house  human  factors  research  with  federal  em-
ployees  who  have  outstanding  human  factors  expertise.  In  addition,  NASA  should
consider  human  factors  requirements  early  in  the  design  phase  of  all  aeronautics
technology research projects.

The committee believes AvSP health would be improved if five-year lifetimes were
not  imposed  on  every  project.  Instead,  a  project  should  endure  for  the  natural  life-
time of the research activity, which would allow basic research efforts to extend be-

1 The FAA’s Free Flight Phase II Office uses Research Transition Plans, which are similar to

the Research Management Plans used by other FAA offices.

yond five years. In addition, the committee found the AvSP research portfolio to be
too product-oriented and recommended that it include more basic research.

The  committee  also  found  that  NASA’s  existing  management  structure  obscures
the  lines  of  responsibility  and  accountability  within  the  program,  to  the  point  that
it  is  difficult  to  trace  project,  subproject,  and  task  goals  to  the  vision  and  goals  of
the program as a whole. The committee recommends that AvSP develop a hierarchy
of goals and improve its management processes to create clearer accountability.

The  committee  believes  that  several  products  under  development  in  AvSP  dupli-
cate similar products being developed in industry. The committee recommends that
AvSP improve its user connections and benchmark its products against similar work
performed  elsewhere.  NASA  should  not  be  working  in  a  specific  technical  area  un-
less  it  is  leading  the  field.  An  outside  advisory  committee  structure  of  some  sort
could assist AvSP in determining which technical areas it should address.

Finally,  the  committee  noted  a  large  gap  in  the  program  portfolio  in  the  area  of
rotorcraft.  NASA  could  significantly  contribute  to  improving  rotorcraft  safety  with-
out substantial additional investment, particularly in the areas of decision aids, syn-
thetic vision, pilot training, workload reduction, and situational awareness.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify.  I  would  be  happy  to  take  any  questions

the Committee might have.

STATEMENT OF DR. PHILIP S. ANTO´ N, DIRECTOR, CENTER

FOR ACQUISITION AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY, RAND

86

Dr. ANTO´ N. Chairman Calvert, and distinguished Members of the
Committee,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  today  on  the  roles
and issues of NASA’s wind tunnel and propulsion test facilities for
American aeronautics. It is an honor and a pleasure to be here.

My comments today are informed by a recent RAND Corporation
assessment of America’s needs for wind tunnel and propulsion test
facilities, and NASA’s capabilities to serve those needs.

What  would  be  the  consequence  to  American  aviation  of  NASA
closing one or more wind tunnels? When NASA closes one or more
strategically  important  wind  tunnel  propulsion  test  facilities,  it
eats away at our aeronautics future. Aeronautics maturity does not
nullify  the  need  for  test  facilities,  but  in  fact,  relies  on  the  avail-
ability and effective use of test facilities to provide important capa-
bilities.

Are there particular wind tunnels that would be especially detri-
mental  to  close?  It  would  be  detrimental  to  close  any  29  of  31
NASA test facilities that serve national needs. Nine facilities would
be  especially  detrimental  to  close.  In  an  attempt  to  identify  which
facilities  would  be  especially  detrimental  to  close,  I  utilized  the
data  from  the  RAND  study  using  the  following  criteria.  The  facili-
ties  most  detrimental  to  close  are  those  that  serve  national  needs
that  can  not  be  met  by  any  other  U.S.  facility,  regardless  of  cost,
moderate improvements, or access concerns. It is important to note
the following. If the facilities that did not make this list are closed,
then  the  testing  costs  to  go  to  other  U.S.  facilities  may  be  much
higher, and relying on them may, in the long run, cost this country
more money. Higher testing costs at alternative U.S. facilities may
drive  users  to  cheaper  foreign  facilities.  The  facilities  most  detri-
mental  to  close  would  affect  any  national  strategic  need  from  all
sectors, NASA research, civil aviation, military, and space, not just
NASA research needs.

There  are  nine  such  facilities  meeting  these  criteria  that  would
be especially detrimental to close. The Ames 12-Foot High-Reynolds
number  pressure  wind  tunnel,  the  Ames  National  Full-Scale  Aero-
dynamics  Complex,  the  Glenn  Icing  Research  Tunnel,  the  Langley
National Transonic Facility, the Langley Transonic Dynamics Tun-
nel, the Langley 8-Foot Hypersonic High-Temperature Tunnel, The
Langley  20-Inch  Mach  6  Tetrafluoromethane  and  Mach  6  Air,  and
finally, the Glenn Hypersonic Tunnel Facility.

Are  there  ways  NASA  could  seek  outside  funding  for  its  wind
tunnels? There are outside funding options for NASA, but their via-
bility is unclear. Possibilities include retainer or consortia fee from
outside  users  from  industry,  or  opening  NASA’s  facilities  to  inter-
national users.

NASA  could  also  explore  shared  funding  mechanisms  with  the
DOD, but that would not reduce the burden on the federal budget,
and begs the question of who in the Federal Government is respon-
sible for looking out for the long-term strategic aeronautic needs of
the Nation.

Are  there  ways  NASA  could  change  its  accounting  practices  re-
garding  its  wind  tunnels?  Elimination  of  full-cost  recovery  for  test
facilities and identifying shared financial support are recommended

options.  The  full-cost  recovery  currently  imposed  by  NASA  on  cen-
ters  discourages  use  and  endangers  strategic  facilities  by  causing
wide,  unpredictable  price  fluctuations.  Shared  support  would  be
relatively  small.  Even  the  total  operating  costs  of  about  $130  mil-
lion  per  year  for  these  important  facilities  make  up  less  than  one
percent  of  NASA’s  overall  budget,  and  are  infinitesimal  related  to
the  $32–58  billion  the  Nation  invests  annually  in  aerospace
RDT&E.

RAND did identify a few accounting options. NASA Langley and
Glenn  tax  the  research  resident  programs  to  supplement  user  fees
and  ensure  that  test  facilities  are  kept  open.  In  addition,  NASA
headquarters  could  consider  creating  a  line  item  in  the  budget  to
provide  financial  shared  support  for  strategic  facilities.  The  DOD’s
Major  Range  and  Test  Facility  Base  model,  with  direct  financial
support, is a mature model, and has served the DOD well.

What  are  the  disadvantages  of  relying  on  foreign  tunnels,  and
how serious are they? Relying on foreign facilities incurs serious se-
curity  risks,  and  unclear  access  and  availability  risks.  An  assess-
ment  performed  by  the  DOD  Counterintelligence  Field  Activity  on
foreign  test  facilities  indicated  that  there  are  real  security  risks  to
testing in foreign facilities.

In  conclusion,  the  most  critical  issues  are  to  develop  an  aero-
nautic  test  technology  vision  and  plan,  identify  shared  financial
support, and stop applying full-cost recovery to wind tunnels. A na-
tional  aeronautics  policy  would  greatly  inform  and  guide  an  aero-
nautics test technology plan.

While  generally  not  redundant  within  NASA,  a  few  of  NASA  fa-
cilities are redundant with those facilities maintained by the DOD,
and  others  are  redundant  with  commercial  facilities.  NASA  should
work  with  the  DOD  to  analyze  the  viability  of  a  national  reliance
plan. Unless NASA, in collaboration with the DOD, addresses spe-
cific  deficiencies,  investment  needs,  budgetary  difficulties,  and  col-
laborative possibilities, the Nation risks losing the competitive aer-
onautics advantage it has enjoyed for decades.

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the debate regard-
ing this important issue area in aeronautics. I am happy to answer
any questions from the Committee, and I would like to request that
my full testimony be entered into the record.

Chairman CALVERT. Without objection, so ordered.

INTRODUCTION

88

My  comments1 today  are  informed  by  a  recent  RAND  Corporation  assessment  of
America’s needs for wind tunnel and propulsion test (WT/PT) facilities,2 and NASA’s
capabilities  to  serve  those  needs.  We  focused  on  the  needs  for,  and  capabilities  of,
the large (and, thus, more expensive to build and operate) test facilities in six types
of  WT/PT  facilities—subsonic,  transonic,  supersonic,  hypersonic,  hypersonic  propul-
sion  integration,  and  direct-connect  propulsion—as  well  as  any  management  issues
they  face.  RAND  conducted  this  research  from  June  2002  through  July  2003,  fol-
lowed  by  refinement  of  our  findings,  peer  review,  and  the  generation  of  study  re-
ports.  The  results  of  the  RAND  study  were  published  in  2004.3 The  study  method-
ology  involved  a  systematic  review  and  analysis  of  national  research,  development,
test,  and  evaluation  (RDT&E)  and  sustainment  needs,  utilization  trends  (historical
and projected), test facility capabilities, and management issues.

While  some  things  have  changed  since  our  study  concluded  (particularly  declines
of NASA’s research programs and aeronautics budget and closure of three facilities),
our technical assessments and much of our strategic assessments remain valid.

In  addition  to  leading  this  study,  I  have  also  remained  active  in  supporting  gov-
ernment  assessments  of  issues  and  options  related  to  WT/PT  facilities.  My  state-
ments below also reflect analysis and experiences related to those activities.
Study Activities

To answer these study questions, RAND conducted intensive and extensive inter-
views with personnel from NASA headquarters; personnel from NASA research cen-
ters at Ames (Moffett Field, Calif.), Glenn (Cleveland, Ohio), and Langley (Hampton,
Va.),  which  own  and  manage  NASA’s  WT/PT  facilities;  the  staff  of  the  Department
of  Defense’s  (DOD’s)  WT/PT  facilities  at  the  U.S.  Air  Force’s  Arnold  Engineering
and Development Center (AEDC, at Arnold AFB, Tenn.); selected domestic and for-
eign test facility owners and operators; U.S. Government and service project officers
with aeronautic programs; and officials in a number of leading aerospace companies
with commercial, military, and space access interests and products.

In  addition  to  RAND  research  staff,  the  study  employed  a  number  of  distin-
guished  senior  advisers  and  consultants  to  help  analyze  the  data  received  and  to
augment the information based on their own expertise with aeronautic testing needs
and various national and international facilities.

Finally,  the  study  reviewed  and  benefited  from  numerous  related  studies  con-

ducted over the past several years.
Perspectives on the Study Approach Used by RAND

The analytic method used in the study to define needs did not rely on an explicit
national policy and strategy document for aeronautics in general or for WT/PT facili-
ties in particular because they do not exist. Lacking such explicit needs documents,
we  examined  what  categories  of  aeronautic  vehicles  the  United  States  is  currently

1 The  opinions  and  conclusions  expressed  in  this  testimony  are  the  author’s  alone  and  should
not  be  interpreted  as  representing  those  of  RAND  or  any  of  the  sponsors  of  its  research.  This
product  is  part  of  the  RAND  Corporation  testimony  series.  RAND  testimonies  record  testimony
presented by RAND associates to federal, State, or local legislative committees; government-ap-
pointed  commissions  and  panels;  and  private  review  and  oversight  bodies.  The  RAND  Corpora-
tion is a nonprofit research organization providing objective analysis and effective solutions that
address the challenges facing the public and private sectors around the world. RAND’s publica-
tions do not necessarily reflect the opinions of its research clients and sponsors.

2 Throughout  this  testimony,  I  use  the  term  ‘‘WT/PT  facilities’’  to  mean  wind  tunnel  facilities
and  propulsion  test  facilities.  Since  individual  facilities  within  this  designation  can  be  either
wind  tunnel  facilities,  propulsion  test  facilities,  or  both,  ‘‘WT/PT  facilities’’  serves  as  a  generic
term to encompass them all. That being said, when a specific facility is talked about, for clarity,
I refer to it using its owner/operator, size, and type. As well, the term ‘‘test facilities’’ and ‘‘facili-
ties’’  can  be  substituted  to  mean  ‘‘WT/PT  facilities.’’  Of  course,  NASA  owns  and  operates  other
types  of  test  facilities,  but  my  conclusions  and  recommendations  do  not  apply  to  them  unless
explicitly stated doing so.

pursuing,  plans  to  pursue,  and  will  likely  pursue  based  on  strategic  objectives  and
current vehicles in use.

Also,  as  enabling  infrastructures,  WT/PT  facility  operations  are  not  funded  di-
rectly by specific line items in the NASA budget.4 The study’s determination of WT/
PT  facility  needs  and  the  resulting  conclusions  and  recommendations  are  therefore
not  based  on  the  federal  budget  process  as  a  direct  indicator  of  policy  dictates  of
facility  need.  We  determined  WT/PT  facility  need  by  identifying  what  testing  capa-
bilities  and  facilities  are  required  given  current  engineering  needs,  alternative  ap-
proaches,  and  engineering  cost/benefit  trade-offs.  This,  of  course,  can  lead  to  a  bias
in the findings in that these assessments may be overly reflective of what the engi-
neering  field  determines  is  important  rather  than  what  specific  program  managers
are  willing  to  spend  on  testing  because  of  program  budget  constraints.  Thus,  when
a needed facility is closed because of a lack of funding, there is a disconnect between
current  funding  and  prudent  engineering  need.  This  indicates  that  the  commercial
and  federal  budget  processes  may  be  out  of  step  with  the  full  cost  associated  with
research  and  design  of  a  particular  vehicle  class,  indicating  a  lack  of  addressing
long-term costs and benefits.

Finally, while the study’s focus was on national needs and NASA’s WT/PT facility
infrastructure,  national  needs  are  not  dictated  or  met  solely  by  NASA’s  test  infra-
structure; DOD, U.S. industry, and foreign facilities also serve many national needs.
Our  study  did  look  at  technical  capabilities  of  alternate  facilities.  However,  the
study  was  not  chartered  or  resourced  to  examine  the  entire  sets  of  cost  and  other
data  for  these  alternative  facilities  to  fully  understand  consolidation  opportunities
between  NASA  and  non-NASA  WT  infrastructures.  Based  on  our  findings,  however,
such a broader study is important and warranted.
WHAT  WOULD  BE  THE  CONSEQUENCE  TO  AMERICAN  AVIATION  OF

NASA CLOSING ONE OR MORE WIND TUNNELS?

When  NASA  closes  one  or  more  strategically  important  wind  tunnel  and  propulsion

test facilities, it eats away at our aeronautic future.

Closing facilities needed for strategic reasons cuts off the country’s options for re-
search and development of current and future concepts and vehicles. Even if current
budgetary priorities limit on-going aeronautic research, we should not ‘‘eat our seed
corn’’ given that it often takes a decade to build these kinds of major facilities, more
years  to  fund  them;  and  replacing  all  these  facilities  would  cost  billions.  Does  the
country want to have a future in advanced aeronautics, or will it decide to relegate
future aeronautic leadership to foreign countries who are aggressively pursuing our
position and its economic fruits?

To  understand  why  this  is  so,  let  me  review  why  this  country  needs  wind  tunnel
and propulsion test facilities. In particular, I would emphasize that this concern ap-
plies  to  strategically  important  facilities,  not  simply  all  facilities  regardless  of  cur-
rent need.
Background

Wind tunnel and propulsion test facilities continue to play important roles in the
research and development (R&D) of new or modified aeronautic systems and in the
test  and  evaluation  (T&E)  and  sustainment  of  developmental  systems.  The  Nation
has  invested  about  a  billion  dollars  (an  unadjusted  total)  in  NASA’s  existing  large,
complex  WT/PT  facilities5 (some  dating  from  the  World  War  II  era),  which  has  cre-
ated  a  testing  infrastructure  that  has  helped  secure  the  country’s  national  security
and prosperity through advances in commercial and military aeronautics and space
systems. Replacing these facilities would cost billions in today’s dollars.6

4 The  construction  of  government  WT/PT  facilities  are,  however,  very  large  expenditures  that
require  explicit  congressional  funding,  and  certain  facilities  such  as  the  National  and  Unitary
facilities have associated congressional directives regarding operation and intent.

5 The  Book  Value  of  26  of  the  31  NASA  facilities  that  fell  within  the  scope  of  RAND’s  study
amounted to about $0.9 billion dollars based on data identified in the NASA Real Property Data-
base.  The  book  value  is  the  simple  sum  of  unadjusted  dollars  invested  in  past  years  in  facility
construction or modernization. Because, in many cases, decades have passed since construction,
the  book  value  is  significantly  lower  than  the  cost  it  would  take  to  build  these  facilities  today.
6 The  current  replacement  value  (CRV)  of  26  of  the  31  NASA  facilities  that  fell  within  the
scope  of  RAND’s  study  totaled  about  $2.5  billion  dollars  based  on  data  identified  in  the  NASA
Real Property Database. The CRV is derived by looking at similar types of buildings (e.g., usage,
size) within the Engineering News Magazine’s section on construction economics. The magazine
uses  a  20-city  average  to  come  up  with  rough  estimates  of  how  much  a  building  would  cost  to
replace.  Most  NASA  finance  and  facilities  people  believe  that  this  average  underestimates  the
actual cost of replacing WT/PT facilities, since they are more complex buildings than the ‘‘simi-

Many  of  these  test  facilities  were  built  when  the  United  States  was  researching
and  producing  aircraft  at  a  higher  rate  than  it  does  today  and  before  advances  in
modeling  and  simulation  occurred.  This  situation  raises  the  question  of  whether
NASA  needs  all  the  WT/PT  facilities  it  has  and  whether  the  ones  NASA  does  have
serve  future  needs.  In  fact,  over  the  past  two  decades,  NASA  has  reduced  its  num-
ber of WT/PT facilities by one-third. More recently, the Agency has closed additional
facilities.  In  addition,  some  of  the  remaining  facilities  are  experiencing  patterns  of
declining use that suggest they too may face closure.
Despite Aeronautic Maturity, Test Facilities Are Still Critical

Some  argue  that  the  facility  testing  capabilities  that  have  been  built  up  over  the
years are no longer needed. They assert that the aeronautics industry has matured
and that any test capability needs can be met through computer simulation or other
means.

Our  research  generally  confirms  industry  maturity,  but  that  maturity  relies  on
the test facility infrastructure. No vehicle classes have gone away, and for each new
design in a class, it will still be necessary to predict airflow behavior across a range
of design considerations.

Although  applied  aeronautics  encompasses  relatively  mature  science  and  engi-
neering  disciplines,  there  is  still  significant  art  and  empirical  testing  involved  in
predicting and assessing the implications of the interactions between aeronautic ve-
hicles  and  the  environments  through  which  they  fly.  Designers  are  often  surprised
by what they find in testing their concepts despite decades of design experience and
dramatic  advances  in  computer  modeling  and  simulation  known  as  computational
fluid  dynamics  (CFD).  This  is,  of  course,  especially  true  for  complex  new  concepts
that are not extensions of established systems with which engineers have extensive
practical  design  and  flight  experience.  But  even  improving  the  performance  at  the
margin  of  well-established  and  refined  designs—for  example,  commercial  jet  liners
in  areas  such  as  reduced  drag,  fuel  efficiency,  emissions,  noise,  and  safety  (e.g.,  in
adverse weather)—depends on appropriate and sufficient WT/PT facility testing.

Insufficient testing or testing in inappropriate facilities can lead to erroneous esti-
mations of performance. Missed performance guarantees can impose extremely cost-
ly  penalties  or  redesign  efforts  on  airframe  manufacturers,  overly  conservative  de-
signs  from  low  estimations  prevent  trade-offs  such  as  range  for  payload,  and  even
a  seemingly  small  one-percent  reduction  in  drag  equates  to  several  million  dollars
in savings per year for a typical aircraft fleet operator.

For engineers to predict with sufficient accuracy the performance of their vehicles
during  design  and  retrofit,  they  need  a  range  of  capabilities  during  testing,  includ-
ing high Reynolds number (Rn),7 flow quality, size, speed, and propulsion simulation
and integration. These capabilities cannot be met by a single test facility but rather
require a suite of facilities.

While  CFD  has  made  inroads  in  reducing  some  empirical  test  requirements  capa-
bilities,  this  technology  will  not  replace  the  need  for  test  facilities  for  the  foreseeable
future.  Flight  testing  complements  but  does  not  replace  WT/PT  facilities  because  of
its  high  costs  and  instrumentation  limitations.  The  aeronautic  engineering  commu-
nity  does  not  have  well-accepted  handbooks  of  facility  testing  ‘‘best  practices’’  or
even  rules  of  thumb  from  which  to  deduce  testing  requirements,  nor  is  it  possible
from historical data to accurately predict returns on specific facility testing in terms
of programmatic cost savings or risk reduction.

Thus,  aeronautic  maturity  does  not  nullify  the  need  for  test  facilities  but  in  fact
relies on the availability and effective use of test facilities to provide important capa-
bilities.  The  Nation  continues  to  need  general-purpose  WT/PT  facilities  across  all
speed regimes, as well as for specialty tests facilities. These facilities advance aero-
space  research,  facilitate  vehicle  design  and  development,  and  reduce  design  and
performance risks in aeronautic vehicles.

lar’’  building  types  available  through  engineering  economics.  Unfortunately,  NASA  has  not
found a better metric to compare buildings across the various field centers.

7 The  Reynolds  number  is  a  nondimensional  parameter  describing  the  ratio  of  momentum
forces to viscous forces in a fluid. The Mach number is a more familiar nondimensional param-
eter, describing the ratio of velocity to the sound speed in the fluid. When the flows around simi-
larly  shaped  objects  share  the  same  nondimensional  Rn  and  Mach  parameters,  the  topology  of
the flow for each will be identical (e.g., laminar and turbulent flow distribution, location of sepa-
ration points, wake structure), and the same aerodynamic coefficients will apply. Airflow behav-
ior changes nonlinearly and unpredictably with changes in Rn. Thus, it is important to test the
flow conditions at flight (or near-flight) Rn to ensure that the flows behave as expected and that
conditions such as undesired turbulence, separations, and buffeting do not occur.

ARE  THERE  PARTICULAR  WIND  TUNNELS  THAT  IT  WOULD  BE  ESPE-

CIALLY DETRIMENTAL TO CLOSE?

It  would  be  detrimental  to  close  any  29  of  the  31  NASA  test  facilities  that  serve  na-
tional  needs.  Nine  facilities—for  which  no  alternatives  exist  within  the  U.S.  re-
gardless of cost—would be especially detrimental to close.

Identifying Facilities Detrimental to Close: A ‘‘Minimum Set’’

RAND  used  four  factors  to  assess  which  NASA  facilities  constitute  the  minimum
set  of  strategically  important  facilities:  alignment  with  national  needs,  technical
competitiveness, redundancy, and usage.

First,  facilities  in  the  minimum  set  must  serve  national  needs.  Thus,  facilities
that  no  longer  meet  national  needs  are  discarded  from  consideration  out  of  hand.
Next,  the  primary  NASA  facilities  that  serve  national  needs  are  included  in  the
set.  These  are  the  primary  facilities  that  NASA  has  to  serve  each  national  need.
Until the need disappears or analysis can determine that it is better served outside
NASA  (see  the  discussion  on  collaboration  and  reliance  below),  the  Agency  should
include it in the minimum set.

Finally,  facilities  that  are  redundant  to  the  primary  facilities  may  or  may  not  be

included in the set depending on their technical competitiveness and utilization.
Nearly All of NASA Facilities Serve Strategic National Needs

We  examined  how  well  NASA’s  portfolio  of  31  test  facilities  aligns  against  na-
tional  strategic  needs  in  each  of  six  categories—subsonic,  transonic,  supersonic,
hypersonic, hypersonic propulsion integration, and direct—connect propulsion. Near-
ly  all  existing  NASA  facilities  serve  at  least  one  strategic  need  category  important
to the Nation’s continuing ability to design aeronautic vehicles. We found very little
overlap and very few gaps in coverage.

NASA’s WT/PT facilities have been generally consistent with the testing needs of
NASA’s  research  programs,  as  well  as  with  those  of  the  broader  national  research
and  development  programs.  Currently,  redundancy  is  minimal  across  NASA.  Facil-
ity  closures  in  the  past  decade  have  eliminated  almost  a  third  of  the  Agency’s  test
facilities  in  the  categories  under  review  in  this  study.  In  nearly  all  test  categories,
NASA has a single facility that serves the general- or special-purpose testing needs,
although  some  primary  facilities  also  provide  secondary  capabilities  in  other  test
categories. We found two noncritical WTs: (1) the Langley 12-Foot Subsonic Atmos-
pheric  WT  Lab,  which  is  redundant  to  the  Langley  14x22-Foot  Subsonic  Atmos-
pheric  WT,  and  (2)  the  Langley  16-Foot  Transonic  Atmospheric  WT,  which  is  gen-
erally  redundant  to  the  Ames  11-Foot  Transonic  High-Rn  and  Langley  National
Transonic Facility WTs run in low-Rn conditions.

There  are  gaps  in  NASA’s  ability  to  serve  all  national  needs.  In  most  of  these

cases, though, DOD or commercial facilities step in to serve the gaps.

Finally, some of NASA’s facilities that serve national needs have been mothballed
or  closed.  While  mothballing  an  important  facility  is  preferred  to  abandonment,
mothballing  involves  the  loss  of  workforce  expertise  required  to  safely  and  effec-
tively  operate  the  facility.  Thus,  mothballing  is  not  an  effective  solution  for  dealing
with long periods of low utilization, and it puts capabilities at risk.
29 of 31 Facilities Should Be in NASA’s ‘‘Minimum Set’’

Based  on  RAND’s  assessment  of  national  needs,  survey  data  of  test  users’  stra-
tegic needs to produce the kinds of vehicles they research or develop, technical capa-
bilities  within  NASA,  and  usage  data,  RAND’s  study  concluded  that  29  of  the  31
existing major NASA test facilities constitute the ‘‘minimum set’’ of facilities impor-
tant  to  retain  and  manage  to  serve  national  needs.  Thus,  the  test  complex  within
NASA  is  both  responsive  to  serving  national  needs  and  mostly  ‘‘right  sized’’  to  the
range of national aeronautic engineering needs. Closing any of the 29 would be det-
rimental.

It  is  important  to  bear  in  mind  that,  while  not  the  case  within  NASA,  a  few  of
NASA’s  facilities  are  redundant  when  considering  the  technical  capabilities  of  the
larger  set  of  facilities  maintained  by  commercial  entities  and  by  the  DOD’s  AEDC.
All such NASA facilities had strategic advocacy resulting from unique features such
as cost effectiveness (e.g., due to their smaller size), technical capabilities, and prox-
imity  to  researchers.  Whether  these  redundancies  amount  to  the  ‘‘unnecessary  du-
plication’’ of facilities prohibited by the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958
was  beyond  the  scope  of  RAND’s  study.  Further  analysis  of  technical,  cost,  and
availability  issues  is  required  to  determine  whether  WT/PT  facility  consolidation
and right-sizing across NASA and AEDC to establish a national reliance test facility
plan  would  provide  a  net  savings  to  the  government  and  result  in  a  smaller  min-
imum set of WT/PT facilities at NASA.

Congress  has  expressed  interest  in  collaboration  between  NASA  and  the  DOD.8
NASA and the DOD (through the National Aeronautics Test Alliance—NATA) have
made some progress in their partnership,9 but NASA’s recent unilateral decision to
close two facilities at Ames without high-level DOD review shows that progress has
been spotty. Some in industry have expressed an interest in exploring collaborative
arrangements  with  NASA  and  hope  that  RAND’s  study  will  reveal  to  others  in  in-
dustry the risks to NASA’s facilities and the need for industry to coordinate its con-
solidations  with  those  of  NASA  and  the  DOD.  Our  study  provides  insights  into  the
problem but offers only glimpses into the wider possibilities and issues surrounding
broader collaboration.
Which Are Especially Detrimental to Close?

In  an  attempt  to  identify  which  of  those  29  facilities  would  be  especially  detri-
mental  to  close,  I  utilized  the  data  from  the  RAND  study  using  the  following  cri-
teria:

The  facilities  most  detrimental  to  close  are  those  that  serve  national  needs  that
cannot  be  met  by  any  other  U.S.  facility  regardless  of  cost,  moderate  improve-
ments, or access concerns.

In  using  these  criteria  to  form  a  list  of  those  facilities  especially  detrimental  to

close, it is important to note the following:

1. If  the  facilities  that  did  not  make  this  list  are  closed,  then  the  testing  costs
to go to other U.S. facilities may be much higher, and relying on them may,
in  the  long  run,  cost  this  country  more  money,  especially  in  future  research
programs  that  would  probably  have  to  spend  more  on  testing  in  alternative
facilities than they would otherwise. In many cases, alternative facilities are
more  sophisticated  and  have  more  capabilities  than  needed  (e.g.,  they  are
larger  or  have  additional  technical  features  that  cost  more).  An  analogy
would  be  to  eliminate  the  ability  of  a  consumer  to  use  a  compact  pickup
truck,  leaving  them  the  only  alternative  of  driving  a  semi  truck  to  work  de-
spite  the  fact  that  the  added  capabilities  of  the  semi  were  not  needed  in  all
cases.

2. Higher testing costs at alternative U.S. facilities may drive users to cheaper
foreign  facilities,  reducing  the  amount  of  domestic  facility  business  and  in-
curring risks discussed later related to foreign facility testing.

3. Each  test  facility  is  unique  in  some  way,  so  this  list  does  not  consider  all

technical differences.

4. The  facilities  most  detrimental  to  close  would  affect  any  strategic  national
need  from  all  sectors—NASA  research,  civil  aviation,  military,  and  space—
not just NASA research needs. Therefore, this list in some way assumes that
NASA, as a ‘‘National’’ agency, still has a role in supporting not just NASA’s
own  research  needs  but  the  Nation’s  aeronautic  needs.  With  a  lack  of  a  re-
cent national aeronautics policy, it is difficult to see if there has been an ob-
jective,  long-term  policy  shift  away  from  NASA  having  a  role  as  a  national
steward  of  government  infrastructure,  or  whether  there  has  been  just  a
short-term  budgetary  prioritization  forcing  NASA  to  focus  on  infrastructure
needed for its own current research.

There  are  nine  facilities  meeting  these  criteria  based  on  the  data  available  from

the RAND study that would be especially detrimental to close:

• Subsonic

— Ames  12-Foot  High-Reynolds  number  pressure  wind  tunnel,  needed,  for
example,  for  high-lift  vehicle  research  and  development  such  as  super-
short  take-off  and  landing  commercial  and  military  passenger,  cargo,
and tanker transports,10

8 See, for example, the GAO report on NASA and DOD cooperation entitled Aerospace Testing:

Promise of Closer NASA/DOD Cooperation Remains Largely Unfulfilled, 1998.

9 For  example,  NATA  has  produced  a  number  of  joint  NASA  and  DOD  consolidation  studies.
10 This facility is currently closed but is the only U.S. capability in this category and has been
historically  important  for  civil,  space,  and  military  vehicle  RDT&E.  Currently,  however,  the  fa-
cility  has  some  undesirable  features  and  limitations  that  render  it  unacceptable  for  both  com-
mercial transport and tactical aircraft development when compared with the two superior facili-
ties  in  Europe:  the  QinetiQ  5-Metre  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  ONERA  F1  in  France.
Users are currently using facilities in Europe, particularly the QinetiQ 5-Metre.

93

— Ames  National  Full-Scale  Aerodynamics  Complex  (NFAC),  needed,  for
example,  for  rotorcraft  and  noise  reduction  research  and  development,
and

— Glenn Icing Research Tunnel, needed for icing research and certification
testing, for example, to prevent accidents from flying in icing conditions.

• Transonic

— Langley National Transonic Facility (NTF), needed, for example, to vali-
date  computational  models  and  test  data  from  lower  Reynolds  number
facilities for transports and high-dynamic fighters,

— Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT), needed, for example, to test
for  noise  problems  and  dynamic  effects  such  as  the  tail  buffeting  prob-
lem not discovered by the F/A–18A program until flight testing.

• Hypersonic (needed to pursue future concepts of hypersonic transport or space

access vehicles and missiles)11

— Langley  8–Foot  High-Temperature  Tunnel  (HTT),  needed  for  a  broad
range  of  moderately  high  Mach  numbers,  is  the  most  important
hypersonic facility in this list,

— Langley  20-Inch  Mach  6  Tetraflouromethane  (M6  CF4)  and  the  com-
panion Langley 20-Inch Mach 6 Air, needed, for example, to understand
real-gas effects,

— Glenn Hypersonic Tunnel Facility (HTF), needed, for example, to under-
stand  whether  combustion  byproducts  in  other  facilities  is  preventing
advances  in  air-breathing  Ramjet  and  Scramjet  that  don’t  require  car-
rying oxygen for combustion.

Note  that  most  of  these  facilities  could  not  be  operated  as  a  commercial  venture
without  shared  financial  support  (as  evidence  by  their  low  current  utilization  and
financial  difficulties).  Nearly  all  would  be  too  expensive  for  industry  to  build  on
their own. Thus, emphasizing the significance of losing them.
ARE  THERE  WAYS  NASA  COULD  SEEK  OUTSIDE  FUNDING  FOR  ITS

WIND TUNNELS?

There are outside funding options for NASA, but their viability is unclear.

The RAND study did not explore in depth the question of outside funding mecha-
nisms,  but  there  are  some  obvious  candidates  for  consideration.  Possibilities  to  ex-
plore include retainer or consortia fees from outside users from industry, or opening
NASA’s facilities to international users (assuming we want to make our national ca-
pabilities  available  to  potential  economic  competitors).  NASA  is  already  exploring
some of these options with U.S. industry.

NASA  could  also  explore  shared  funding  mechanisms  with  the  DOD,  but  that,  of
course,  would  not  reduce  the  burden  on  the  federal  budget  and  begs  the  question
of  who  in  the  Federal  Government  is  responsible  for  looking  out  for  the  long-term
strategic aeronautic needs of the Nation.
ARE  THERE  WAYS  NASA  COULD  CHANGE  ITS  ACCOUNTING  PRAC-

TICES REGARDING ITS WIND TUNNELS?

Elimination  of  full-cost  recovery  for  test  facilities  and  identifying  shared  financial

support are recommended options.

Why Are Financial Accounting and Shared Support So Important?

The  current  full-cost  recovery  (FCR)  accounting  policy  imposed  by  NASA  on  the
centers discourages use and endanger strategic facilities by causing wide, unpredict-
able price fluctuations in a world where government and commercial testing budgets
are under pressure and are set years in advance. It appears reasonable to ask users
to  pay  for  the  costs  associated  with  their  tests  (i.e.,  to  pay  for  the  short-term  bene-
fits), but forcing them to pay all operating costs (including long-term priorities such
as the costs for facility time they are not using) through FCR direct test pricing (as
is done at Ames) is ill advised.

11 Note  that  users  in  our  surveys  rated  nearly  all  of  NASA’s  hypersonic  facilities  as  essential
for continued progress. Thus, it is particularly difficult to identify those that are especially detri-
mental to lose given that each facility offers important capabilities. Because hypersonics is still
relatively immature, those differences are important in resolving the wide variety of challenges
facing  the  research,  development,  and  production  communities.  Nevertheless,  the  Langley  8–
Foot  HTT  is  definitely  the  most  advocated  facility,  and  the  two  Langley  Mach  6  tunnels  and
the Glenn HTF offer significant capabilities not available elsewhere in the U.S.

FCR  has  especially  serious  implications  for  the  financial  health  of  those  facilities
that  are  underutilized  (about  one-third  of  the  facilities  in  general,  with  variation
across  the  test  facility  category  types).  Average-cost-based  pricing,  decentralized
budgeting,  poor  strategic  coordination  between  buyers  and  providers  of  NASA  WT/
PT facility services, and poor balancing of short- and long-term priorities inside and
outside  NASA  are  creating  unnecessary  financial  problems  that  leave  elements  of
the  U.S.  WT/PT  facility  capacity  underfunded.  With  declining  usage  and  FCR  ac-
counting, these facilities run the risk of financial collapse. Identifying shared finan-
cial support will keep NASA’s minimum set of facilities from financial collapse given
the long-term need for these facilities.

In the extreme case at Ames, the lack of resident aeronautics research programs,
combined  with  the  center  management’s  strategic  focus  toward  information  tech-
nology and away from ground test facilities, has left Ames WT/PT facilities without
support  beyond  user  testing  fees.  Thus,  Ames  WT/PT  facilities  are  vulnerable  to
budgetary shortfalls given low utilization. Two Ames facilities are unique and need-
ed  in  the  United  States,  yet  they  have  already  been  closed.  One  (the  Ames  NFAC)
is in the process of being transferred to DOD operation, but the other remains aban-
doned.

Shared support would be relatively small. Even the total operating costs of about
$130  million  per  year  for  these  important  facilities  make  up  less  than  one  percent
of NASA’s overall budget and are infinitesimal relative to the $32–58 billion the Na-
tion  invests  annually  in  aerospace  research,  development,  test,  and  evaluation
(RDT&E).

If  NASA  management  is  not  proactive  in  providing  financial  support  for  such  fa-
cilities  beyond  what  is  likely  to  be  available  from  FCR  pricing,  then  the  facilities
are in danger of financial collapse. In the near-term, this market-driven result may
allow  NASA  to  reallocate  its  resources  to  serve  more  pressing  near-term  needs  at
the  expense  of  long-term  needs  for  WT/PT  facilities.  Given  the  continuing  need  for
the  capabilities  offered  by  these  facilities  for  the  RDT&E  of  aeronautic  and  space
vehicles  related  to  the  general  welfare  and  security  of  the  United  States,  the  right-
sizing  NASA  has  accomplished  to  date,  the  indeterminate  costs  to  decommission  or
eliminate  these  facilities,  the  significant  time  and  money  that  would  be  required  to
develop  new  replacement  WT/PT  facilities,  and  the  relatively  modest  resources  re-
quired to sustain these facilities, care should be taken to balance near-term benefits
against  long-term  risks.  Collaboration,  reliance,  and  ownership  transferal  options
for  obtaining  alternative  capabilities  in  lieu  of  certain  facilities  are  possible,  but
even  if  these  options  are  exercised,  many  NASA  facilities  will  remain  unique  and
critical to serving national needs. Key to subsequent analysis of these options is the
collection and availability of the full costs of operating these facilities as well as the
full costs associated with relying on alternative facilities.
Accounting Options

RAND  identified  a  few  accounting  options  to  recovering  full  operating  costs

through user fees.

Taxing  Research  Programs.  NASA  Langley  and  Glenn  tax  the  resident  re-
search  programs  to  supplement  user  fees  and  ensure  that  test  facilities  are  kept
open.  However,  the  ability  to  keep  current  facilities  open  through  those  taxing
mechanisms  are  at  risk  as  the  aeronautics  research  program  budgets  continue  to
decline.  Also,  NASA  Ames  currently  does  not  have  a  resident  aeronautics  research
program to tax.

Line  Item  and  MRTFB-Like  Model.  NASA  Headquarters  could  consider  cre-
ating  a  line  item  in  the  budget  to  provide  financial  shared  support  for  strategic  fa-
cilities. The DOD’s Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) model, with direct
financial  support,  is  the  most  mature  and  has  served  the  DOD  well.  This  support
has allowed the DOD to keep its strategic facilities open through times of low utili-
zation. The DOD Financial Management Regulation provide lessons learned through
its  user  accounting  and  management  guidelines,  essentially  charging  users  for  the
direct costs associated with their tests but not the full costs to keep the facility open
for the year.

UK MOD Outsourcing Model. Finally, another accounting and management op-
tion  is  the  facility  operations  outsourcing  model  recently  enacted  by  the  UK  Min-
istry of Defence (MOD) for its T&E facilities.

Under  this  model,  the  MOD  identified  the  T&E  facilities  it  needed  for  the  future
and  then  privatized  the  operation  of  those  facilities.  Ownership  of  the  fixed  equip-
ment  and  land  were  retained  by  the  MOD  for  indemnity  reasons,  but  ownership  of
the movable items was transferred to a private company, QinetiQ.

95

Under  the  model,  QinetiQ  has  a  25-year  contract  for  operating  the  facilities.  The
contract is structured to encourage the company to implement efficiencies while re-
taining  the  long-term  health  and  availability  of  the  facilities.  QinetiQ  gets  to  keep
the  efficiency  savings  realized  during  the  then-current  five-year  period  of  the  con-
tract.  When  the  next  five-year  period  is  negotiated,  the  MOD  receives  the  benefits
of the efficiencies by adjusting the period funding amount to the new efficiency level.
The  key  to  this  model  was  the  MOD’s  access  to  all  facility  costs  to  ensure  that
support  levels  in  the  contract  guarantee  the  success  of  QinetiQ  and  the  facilities.
In  U.S.  parlance,  this  would  require  open  full-cost  accounting  not  only  of  the  facili-
ties but also of the acquisition programs that rely on the facilities.

The  model  employs  shared  support  for  the  facilities.  In  the  current  five-year  pe-
riod, the MOD centrally funds 84 percent of facility costs to keep the facilities’ doors
open.  Sixteen  percent  of  the  funding  comes  from  programs  to  support  direct  costs
of  specific  program  test  activities.  In  the  past,  the  MOD  had  to  query  programs  for
how much they would put in first. Now, the health of the facilities are ensured and
planned  for,  regardless  of  the  realized  utilization  in  the  known-variable  environ-
ment.

The  MOD  implemented  the  model  in  2003,  so  the  long-term  success  of  it  has  yet
to  be  established.  Nevertheless,  some  important  observations  can  be  made.  The
MOD made a conscious, objective decision about which facilities are strategically im-
portant  in  the  long  term  (25  years,  in  this  case).  The  ministry  ensured  that  it  ac-
counted  for  all  the  costs  to  inform  its  decision.  It  provided  shared  support  for  the
facilities  to  ensure  their  long-term  health,  independent  of  the  yearly  utilization.
While not having to perform the actual operation of the facilities, the MOD provided
controls  and  incentives  to  realize  efficiency  and  cost  savings  while  ensuring  quality
and availability of needed facilities. NASA could learn from these observations.

Full-Cost Accounting. Finally, while our study recommended that NASA should
change  its  policy  of  Full-Cost  Recovery  (where  operators  must  recover  the  full  an-
nual  costs  of  operating  facilities  from  the  users  regardless  of  the  actual  utilization
of those facilities), we applaud NASA’s implementation of Full-Cost Accounting (that
ensures  we  know  the  full  costs  of  operating  activities).  It  is  important  to  know  the
full costs of operations to inform management analysis and decision-making.
WHAT  ARE  THE  DISADVANTAGES  OF  RELYING  ON  FOREIGN  WIND

TUNNELS, AND HOW SERIOUS ARE THEY?

Relying  on  foreign  facilities  incurs  serious  security  risks,  and  unclear  access  and

availability risks.

The  RAND  study  did  not  explore  in  depth  the  policy  issues  of  relying  on  foreign
wind tunnel, but some observations and references can be made. It appears that the
main disadvantages are security, access, and availability risks.

As  a  continuation  of  my  involvement  in  this  area,  I  have  been  briefed  on  an  as-
sessment  performed  by  the  DOD  Counterintelligence  Field  Activity  (CIFA)  on  for-
eign test facilities.12 That report indicated that there are real security risks to test-
ing  in  foreign  facilities.  ‘‘Without  tight  controls  on  access  and  data  management,
critical technology is at significant risk for compromise at most, if not all, of the [for-
eign  facilities  that  CIFA  considered],  or  in  transit  to  and  from  them.  Despite  con-
tractual  security  specifications,  the  designs  or  data  deployed  to  these  sites  is  in  a
virtual  sea  of  potential  collectors  whether  representing  national,  commercial  or  pri-
vate interests.’’ I commend that report to the committee for its classified details.

While the RAND study did not analyze them in detail, access and availability are
also  of  concern,  especially  given  an  international  competitive  environment  in  aero-
nautics and tensions that arise occasionally (even with allies) and the unstable glob-
al business of wind tunnel facility operation. In general, if we rely on foreign facili-
ties for strategically important capabilities, then we put our strategic needs at risk.
At the very least, the government should explore reliance agreements to help reduce
security  risks  and  establish  long-term  agreements  to  ensure  access  as  well  as  the
long-term financial and technical stability of those facility operations.

In  the  course  of  our  study,  RAND  did  find  that  there  is  some  reliance  on  foreign
test  facilities,  particularly  on  the  QinetiQ  5–Metre  subsonic  high-Reynolds  number
wind  tunnel.  If  additional  NASA  facilities  are  closed,  the  country  will  be  forced  to
rely  more  on  foreign  facilities  for  capabilities  it  cannot  find  domestically,  including
those that are inexpensive alternatives to larger, remaining U.S. facilities.

CONCLUSIONS

For NASA leadership, the most critical issues are to:

96

• develop  a  specific  and  clearly  understood  aeronautics  test  technology  vision

• identify  shared  financial  support  and  stop  applying  full-cost  recovery  to  WT/

and plan;

PT facilities;

ties.

• continue to support developing plans to very selectively consolidate and broad-

ly modernize existing test facilities; and

• prescribe  common  management  and  accounting  directions  for  NASA’s  facili-

This  vision  cannot  be  developed  apart  from  other  critical  national  decisions.  It
must  be  informed  by  the  long-term  aeronautic  needs,  visions,  and  capabilities  of
both the commercial and military sectors supported by NASA’s aeronautical RDT&E
complexes.  A  national  aerospace  policy  would  greatly  inform  and  guide  an  aero-
nautics test technology plan.

Given  the  inherent  inability  to  reliably  and  quantitatively  predict  all  needs  for
RDT&E to support existing programs much beyond a few months out, the tendency
of multi-year surges in aeronautic programs, and the trends indicating a continuing
decline  in  needed  capacity  to  support  these  needs  for  the  foreseeable  future,  long-
term  strategic  considerations  must  dominate.  If  this  view  is  accepted,  then  NASA
must  find  a  way  to  sustain  indefinitely  and,  in  a  few  cases,  enhance  its  important
facilities  (or  seek  to  ensure  reliable  and  cost-effective  alternatives  to  its  facilities)
as identified in the RAND study.

While generally not redundant within NASA, a few of NASA’s facilities are redun-
dant with those of facilities maintained by the DOD, and others are redundant with
commercial  facilities.  NASA  should  work  with  the  DOD  to  analyze  the  viability  of
such a national reliance plan because it could affect the determination of the future
minimum set of facilities NASA must continue to support.

NASA  should  pursue  all  three  testing  approaches—facility,  CFD,  and  flight—to
meeting national testing needs; establish the minimum set of facilities important to
retain  and  manage  to  serve  national  needs;  reassess  poorly  utilized  facilities  for
strategic, long-term needs rather than eliminate them out of hand; identify financial
support  concepts  to  keep  its  current  minimum  set  of  facilities  healthy  for  the  good
of the country; continue to invest in CFD; eliminate the backlog of maintenance and
repair at its facilities; and address hypersonic air-breathing research challenges.

Unless  NASA,  in  collaboration  with  the  DOD,  addresses  specific  deficiencies,  in-
vestment  needs,  budgetary  difficulties,  and  collaborative  possibilities,  the  Nation
risks losing the competitive aeronautics advantage it has enjoyed for decades.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  contribute  to  the  debate  regarding  this  impor-
tant  issue  area  in  aeronautics.  I  am  happy  to  answer  any  questions  from  the  Com-
mittee.

STATEMENT OF DR. MIKE J. BENZAKEIN, CHAIRMAN, DEPART-
MENT  OF  AEROSPACE  ENGINEERING,  OHIO  STATE  UNIVER-
SITY
Dr. BENZAKEIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Members

of the Committee.

I  think  we  need  aeronautics  technology  to  create  a  civil  aviation
industry  that  will  bring  safe,  clean,  affordable  jet  service  to  every
community. To do that, it will take research and a new generation
of  highly  trained  Americans  to  create  the  vehicles,  airports,  air
traffic  management  systems  to  make  this  possible.  The  national
needs can be summarized as follows. U.S. competitiveness, freedom
of  air  travel,  flight  safety,  security  and  defense  of  our  nation,  pro-
tection of the environment, education of the future workforce.

The U.S. has enjoyed a favorable balance of trade in aeronautics
since—every year since 1970. This is based on the fact that we own
the right technologies, which permits us to adopt the right market
and product strategies. This could change in the next 10 years. The
European  Union,  as  well  as  others,  have  decided  to  make  the  nec-
essary investment to threaten our leadership position in the indus-
try. Europe is also developing a strong partnership between indus-
try,  government,  and  academia.  It  is  led  by  industry  and  focused
on their needs.

Technology  breakthroughs  are  required  for  emission,  acoustic,
fuel efficiency. We are at the point of diminishing returns with cur-
rent  technology,  and  the  United  States  needs  to  fund  R&D  for
quantum  improvement  as  we  move  forward.  There  is  also  a  need
to triple the current airspace capacity. Last, but not least, we must
address  the  need  for  a  first-rate  aerospace  engineering  workforce,
as they hold the key to the future.

So, what is NASA’s role in the aeronautics agenda? Let me start
by  saying  that  technology  developed  by  NASA  has  been  key  to  the
success of jet engines, which is the industry I am coming from. The
Energy Efficient program, the Quiet Engine Program, sponsored by
NASA  in  ’80s  and  the—in  the  ’70s  and  the  ’80s,  did  identify  tech-
nologies that found themselves in product lines, like the GE90 fam-
ily  that  powers  the  Boeing  777  today,  and  who  spawned  products
like the GEnx, which will power the 787 at Boeing tomorrow.

Why NASA? The answer is simple. There is no other agency that
can  do  it.  DOD,  of  course,  has  the  technical  expertise  in  airframe
and  engine  systems,  but  their  focus  is  on  weapon  systems,  as  it
needs  to  be.  While  FAA’s  mission  is  similar,  it  has  neither  the  ex-
pertise nor the infrastructures required.

How  effective  are  NASA  programs?  They  have  been  effective  in
the ’70s and ’80s. Unfortunately, the critical link to industry began
to  break  down  in  the  late  ’90s.  The  curtailment  of  budget  dictated
by  the  funding  needs  of  the  International  Space  Station  and  other
space  projects  have  left  the  Agency  struggling  to  identify  its  mis-
sion  and  agenda  in  aeronautics.  So  NASA’s  effectiveness  in  help,
ensuring  the  U.S.  industrial  competitiveness  in  civil  aeronautics  is
unfortunately  diminishing.  The  intellectual  power  is  there.  The  fa-
cilities  are  still  there.  And  so  is  the  will  to  do  it,  but  the  budget

is not. So, this is creating a serious void for this nation as we look
forward.

That brings me to the next subject, the impact of the 2006 budg-
et cuts. I am sorry to say that these cuts are having and will have
serious  implications  on  the  ability  of  NASA  to  continue  to  play  a
relevant role in aeronautics in the future. The cuts that were made
affect not only the programs that the industry needs, but cuts into
the  core  of  NASA  competency  and  facilities  at  centers  like  Glenn
and  Langley.  These  centers  have  some  unique  competencies  to  the
Nation and the world, and we are going to lose them. In the years
ahead, both people and facilities will be gone, with little chance for
recovery.

That  takes  us  back  to  what  is  NASA’s  mission?  The  technology
that  NASA  develops  in  civil  aviation  will  be  used  by  industry  and
the  FAA.  It  is  therefore  paramount  that  a  very  strong  partnership
exists  between  NASA  and  its  stakeholders.  This  kind  of  strong
partnership  exists  in  Europe,  where  industry  shapes  most  of  the
technology program. The U.S. needs to learn from this relationship.
The  end  user  has  to  be  part  of  the  process.  Is  this  corporate  wel-
fare?  The  answer  is  no.  The  industry  is  not  looking  for  NASA  to
fund  the  development  of  their  products,  but  they  do  need  NASA’s
help to do the fundamental research and screening of high-risk con-
cepts before industry picks it up. The alliance works. It has gotten
the  U.S.  aeronautics  industry  its  leadership  position,  and  we  need
to ensure that it stays there.

So  where  do  we  go  from  here?  I  believe  that  aeronautics  needs
a  national  vision  and  an  agenda  to  move  forward.  I  believe,  also,
that  the  vision  and  strategy  must  be  developed  in  partnership  by
industry,  academia,  and  the  Federal  Government.  Aeronautics
must have a vision and goals, like those that NASA has set for re-
turning  to  the  Moon  and  going  to  Mars.  So,  how  do  we  get  this
started? Well, we already have.

In  response  to  the  Aerospace  Commission  Report  and  other  na-
tional  studies,  Congress  asked  the  National  Institute  of  Aerospace
to  work  with  the  aeronautics  industry  and  academia  to  develop  a
research  plan  and  budget  for  the  next  five  years  that  would  sub-
stantially augment ongoing NASA programs. More than 250 of the
Nation’s  aeronautics  aviation  experts  from  industry  and  academic
have developed an integrated budget plan that contains roadmaps,
milestones, and funding requirements for aeronautics technology to
address the Nation’s needs in the years ahead.

The result of this intense effort that has taken place over the last
five months is being summarized in a report to Congress, which is
targeted to be available at the end of the month.

Chairman  CALVERT.  And  Doctor,  if  you  could  summarize  your

statement, we have to recess very shortly.

Dr. BENZAKEIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members of the Sub-
committee.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  testify  today,  and  to
share  my  views  on  aeronautics  and  the  roles  that  NASA  plays.  I
believe  that  the  opportunities  are  there,  the  needs  are  there,  and
the  strong  partnership  between  industry,  let  me  repeat  that,  I
think  it  needs  a  partnership  to  move  ahead.  And  we  need  a  part-
nership  in  industry,  academia,  and  NASA,  but  we  need  a  strong,

stable  support  from  Congress  and  the  Administration,  and  that  is
the answer.

Thank you very much.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Benzakein follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF STATEMENT OF MIKE J. BENZAKEIN

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:

The National Authorization Act for FY 2001 created ‘‘The Commission on the Fu-
ture  of  the  United  States  Aerospace  Industry’’  as  a  bipartisan  effort  to  address
Congress’s  concern  for  America’s  economic  and  national  security.  The  Commission
issued an urgent call to the White House and Congress to increase and sustain sig-
nificant and stable funding in long-term research and associated Research, Develop-
ment  and  Technology  infrastructure.  Some  of  us  have  been  working  to  help  Con-
gress respond to that call.
The Importance of Aeronautics

From  building  the  strongest  economy  in  the  world  to  winning  the  war  on  terror,
we  need  aeronautics  technology  to  create  a  civil  aviation  industry  that  will  bring
affordable  jet  service  to  every  community.  Moving  people  and  goods  faster,  safer,
more cost effectively and more securely to any place in the world in a more environ-
mentally  friendly  way  will  benefit  the  American  public  and  the  American  economy.
To  do  so  will  take  research  and  a  new  generation  of  highly  trained  Americans  to
create  the  vehicles,  airports  and  air  traffic  management  systems  to  make  this  pos-
sible. The national needs can be summarized as follows:

• U.S. economic competitiveness
• Freedom of air travel
• Flight safety
• Secure and defend the Nation
• Protect the environment
• Educate the future workforce

In  all  partnerships  around  the  world,  the  U.S.  industry  must  maintain  a  leader-
ship position. The U.S. has enjoyed a favorable balance of trade in aeronautics every
year  since  1970.  In  2003,  this  was  $27  billion—not  an  insignificant  number.  Aero-
nautics research is key to maintaining our leadership.

Leadership is based on the fact that we own the right technologies, which permit
us  to  adopt  the  right  market  and  product  strategies.  This  could  change  in  the  next
10  years.  The  European  Union,  as  well  as  a  number  of  Asian  governments  and,
most  recently,  the  Canadian  government,  are  making  the  necessary  investments  to
threaten  our  leadership  position  in  this  industry.  The  European  2020  Vision  un-
equivocally  states  that  the  E.U.  wants  to  be  #1  in  aeronautics  by  the  year  2020.
They  have  increased  their  funding  in  aeronautics  by  a  factor  of  20  over  the  last  10
years.  To  this  one  can  add  the  individual  European  governments’  funding  (United
Kingdom, France, Germany, etc.). Europe is also developing a strong partnership be-
tween industry, government and academia. In fact, it is led by industry and focused
on their near-term and mid-term needs.

Meanwhile,  U.S  aeronautics  research  is  focused  primarily  on  more  revolutionary,
long  term  research  instead  of  the  need  to  maintain  our  economic  competitiveness.
We need a balance between long-term and shorter-term research. In addition as we
move forward, aeronautics research must develop the tools and technologies to pro-
vide  the  comfort,  performance,  fuel  economy,  and  reduced  emissions  and  noise  ex-
pected  by  the  traveling  public.  These  advanced  tools  and  technologies  require  re-
search on airframe and propulsion for both large and small vehicle systems.

We  need  to  facilitate  the  ease  of  travel  from  point  to  point  with  small  vehicles
as  well  as  meet  the  requirement  to  travel  faster  around  the  globe.  Technology
breakthroughs  are  critically  needed  for  acoustics  and  fuel  efficiency.  We  are  at  the
point of diminishing returns with current technologies, and the United States needs
to fund R&D for quantum improvements as we move forward.

There is also a necessity to triple the current airspace capacity in the U.S. To ac-
complish  this  will  take  close  cooperation  between  the  different  agencies  of  the  Fed-
eral  Government,  industry  and  academia.  The  freedom  of  air  transportation  and
America’s ability to advance economically are lost if the aviation system is not safe,
secure and capable of handling the increasing demand for airspace. It is critical that

the  research  agenda  recognizes  current  and  future  system  vulnerabilities  based  on
changing transportation concepts and designs.

Last  but  not  least,  we  need  to  educate  our  workforce.  There  is  an  increased  de-
mand  for  students  in  Aeronautical  Engineering.  We  need  to  interest  young  people
in science and engineering. We have to start at K through 12, continue through col-
lege. We must prepare undergraduate and graduate students—B.S., M.S., and Ph.D.
candidates—for  what  should  be  very  exciting  careers  in  aeronautics.  We  need  more
U.S.  students  pursuing  advanced  degrees.  These  young  people  will  be  key  if  the
United States is to maintain its aeronautics leadership in the world.
NASA’s Role

So what role should NASA play in the aeronautics agenda? Let me start by saying
that  technologies  developed  by  NASA  have  been  key  to  the  success  of  jet  engines,
which is the industry where I have spent most of my life. The Energy Efficient En-
gine  Program,  the  Quiet  Engine  Program,  etc.,  sponsored  by  NASA  in  the  1970’s
and 1980’s identified technologies that eventually found themselves in product lines
like  the  GE90  family  of  engines  that  powers  the  Boeing  777  today.  They  have  also
spawned  products  like  the  GEnx  which  will  power  the  Boeing  787  tomorrow.  With-
out  this  research,  GE  could  not  have  had  the  composite  fan  blades,  the  high  pres-
sure-ratio  core,  or  the  low  emission  double  annular  combustor  that  put  them  in  a
leading position in the industry today.

Why  NASA?  The  answer  is  simple:  There  is  no  other  agency  that  can  take  that
role  in  the  United  States  today.  In  1915  Congress  created  the  National  Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics (NACA); this organization was reconstituted as NASA in
1958  as  the  United  States  entered  the  race  for  space.  From  1915  onward,  NACA/
NASA  has  invested  in  aeronautics  research  and  technology—an  investment  in  the
future  of  this  nation.  Over  the  years,  Industry  and  Academia  have  come  to  depend
on  NASA’s  support  to  invest  in  longer-term  research—but  always  with  an  eye  to
providing  a  benefit  to  the  American  public.  This  investment  has  been  small  com-
pared  to  the  infrastructure  it  supports  and  the  balance  of  trade  benefits  it  brings.
DOD,  of  course,  has  the  technical  expertise  in  airframe  and  engine  systems,  but
their focus is on weapon systems as it should be, and DOD does not have the same
priorities as civil aviation. In fact, DOD has traditionally relied on NASA to provide
noise  and  emissions  breakthroughs  that  could  be  adopted  by  the  military.  While
FAA’s research mission is similar, they have neither the expertise nor infrastructure
required.

How  effective  are  NASA’s  programs?  They  have  been  very  effective  in  the  1970’s
and  1980’s  as  I  previously  said.  Unfortunately,  the  critical  link  to  industry  began
to break down in the late 1990’s. The termination of the High Speed Research Pro-
gram  and  the  Advanced  Subsonic  Technology  Program  marked  the  beginning  of  a
downslide that continues today. The curtailment of budgets dictated by the funding
needs of the International Space Station and other space projects has left the Agen-
cy  struggling  to  identify  its  mission  and  agenda  in  aeronautics.  It  has  valiantly
tried. The NASA Aeronautics Blueprint published in 2002 articulated very well the
correct goals of the Agency. Unfortunately, adequate funding was never there to ful-
fill these goals. More important, the funding was never stable enough to launch and
sustain any significant initiatives. So NASA’s effectiveness in helping to ensure the
U.S.  industrial  competitiveness  in  civil  aeronautics  is  unfortunately  diminishing.
The  intellectual  power  is  still  there,  the  facilities  are  still  there,  and  so  is  the  will
to  do  it;  but  the  funding  is  not.  This  is  creating  a  serious  void  for  this  nation  as
we look ahead.
Budget Cuts

That  brings  me  to  the  next  subject—the  impact  of  budget  cuts.  I  am  sorry  to  say
that these cuts are having and will have serious implications on the ability of NASA
to  continue  to  play  a  relevant  role  in  aeronautics  in  the  future.  The  cuts  have  oc-
curred primarily in the Vehicle Systems Program, which defined technologies for the
airframe and propulsion systems of the future. These technologies are aimed at en-
suring  U.S.  competitiveness  in  the  years  ahead.  The  cuts  that  were  made  unfortu-
nately  affect  not  only  the  programs  that  industry  needs,  but  cut  into  the  core  of
NASA  competency  and  facilities  at  centers  like  Glenn  and  Langley.  These  centers
have  some  competencies  unique  to  the  Nation  and  the  world,  and  we  are  going  to
lose  them.  In  a  few  years,  both  people  and  facilities  will  be  gone  with  little  chance
for recovery.

NASA  has  refocused  the  Vehicle  Systems  Program  to  address  four  revolutionary
high risk ‘‘barrier breaking’’ technologies. They represent a valiant effort to salvage
what is remaining of the vehicle system programs. However, the funding constraints
make  even  these  programs  highly  inadequate.  Let  me  take  for  example  the  super-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:40 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 020007 PO 00000 Frm 00104 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\031605\20007 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

101

sonic  airplane  program  which  focuses  on  the  need  to  reduce  the  sonic  boom.  We
need to do it and it is the right thing to do, but it currently focuses only on changes
in airframe configuration. At the same time there are a flock of technologies dealing
with materials, engine emissions and engine noise, airplane systems, etc., that must
be addressed if we want to have a supersonic airplane program in the future.

That takes us back to what is NASA’s aeronautics mission? Before I speak to this,
let  me  discuss  the  role  of  the  industry.  When  DOD  develops  technology,  it  does  so
for  its  own  use,  its  own  vehicles,  its  own  weapons  systems.  The  technologies  that
NASA  develops  for  civil  aviation  will  be  used  primarily  by  industry  and  the  FAA.
It is therefore paramount that a very strong partnership exists between NASA and
its  stakeholders.  This  kind  of  strong  partnership  exists  in  Europe  where  industry
shapes most of the technology programs. The U.S. needs to learn from this relation-
ship.  The  end  user  has  to  be  part  of  the  process.  Is  this  ‘‘corporate  welfare’’?  The
answer is no. Industry looks to NASA to screen technologies and help define the key
game changers that are worth pursuing.

Let’s  take,  for  example,  the  NASA  Clean  Combustor  Program.  Under  this  1970’s
NASA  program,  GE  looked  at  different  combustor  concepts  to  reduce  nitric  oxides
(NOΧ).  GE  identified  a  double  annular  configuration  as  a  leading  candidate,  ran  it
in an engine and declared victory. But it wasn’t until the mid 1980’s that the pres-
sure  for  low  NOΧ was  such  that  GE  decided  to  put  the  double  annular  combustor
into  some  of  their  products.  It  cost  GE  over  $100  million  to  make  it  service  ready
for  the  CFM  and  GE90  families.  I  use  this  example  to  show  that  industry  is  not
looking  for  NASA  to  fund  the  development  of  their  products,  but  they  do  need
NASA’s help to do the fundamental research and screening of high-risk concepts be-
fore industry picks them up. This alliance works. It has gotten the U.S. aeronautics
industry its leadership position, and we need to ensure that it stays intact.
The Go Forward Plan

So  where  do  we  go  from  here?  I  believe  that  aeronautics  needs  a  national  vision
and  an  agenda  to  move  forward.  I  believe  also  that  the  vision  and  strategy  must
be developed in partnership by industry, academia and the Federal Government. It
should  be  focused  on  aeronautics  priorities  based  in  future  commercial  regulatory
challenges. Challenging aeronautical goals for 2015/2020 need to be established tar-
geting 85 percent lower emissions, 50 percent lower noise, 30 percent lower fuel con-
sumption,  3  ×  thruput,  etc.  Aeronautics  must  have  a  vision  and  specific  goals  like
those  that  NASA  has  for  returning  to  the  Moon  and  going  to  Mars.  So,  how  do  we
get this started? Well, we already have.

In response to the Aerospace Commission Report and other National studies, Con-
gress asked the National Institute of Aerospace to work with the aeronautics indus-
try  and  academia  to  develop  an  aeronautics  research  plan  and  budget  for  the  next
five  years  that  would  substantially  augment  ongoing  NASA  programs.  More  than
250  of  the  Nation’s  aeronautics/aviation  experts  from  industry  and  academia  have
developed  an  integrated  budget  plan  that  contains  roadmaps,  milestones  and  fund-
ing  requirements  for  aeronautics  technology  to  address  the  Nation’s  needs  in  the
years ahead. It addresses the requirements for:

• airspace systems
• aviation safety and security
• hypersonics
• rotor craft
• subsonic vehicles
• supersonic vehicles
• workforce and education

The  result  of  this  intense  effort  that  has  taken  place  over  the  last  five  months
is being summarized in a report to Congress that is targeted to be available by the
end  of  this  month.  The  team  has  worked  hard  to  balance  the  short  and  long-range
needs of the Nation. The short-range needs address technologies for systems and ve-
hicles  to  be  ready  in  the  years  2015–2020.  The  long-range  needs  address  require-
ments for systems required in the years 2040–2050. In addition to research require-
ments,  we  addressed  the  need  for  a  strong  aerospace  workforce,  suggesting  coali-
tions  to  revamp  the  way  we  prepare  students  for  careers  in  industry.  The  proposal
is  to  transform  aeronautical  engineering  programs  to  meet  industry  needs  and  will
require a paradigm shift in emphasis on the way we educate B.S. students, and will
require a collaboration of all elements that make up the educational system.

As  said  earlier,  this  report  should  be  available  to  Congress  and  to  NASA  by  the
end of this month. We look to Congress and the Administration to call for a national

vision for aeronautics and hope that this report will serve as a baseline upon which
to build the aeronautics strategy for the future.
Summary

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  I  appreciate  the
opportunity to testify today and to share my views on aeronautics and the role that
NASA  plays  in  aeronautics  research.  The  partnership  between  NASA  and  industry
has meant success to the United States in aeronautics in the past. The budget pres-
sures  on  NASA  are  at  the  point  of  potentially  creating  a  technology  void  in  the  fu-
ture.  It  is  important  that  this  be  turned  around.  The  opportunities  are  there,  the
needs  are  there  and  a  strong  partnership  between  industry,  academia  and  NASA
with strong, stable support from Congress and the Administration is the answer.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Thank  you,  Doctor,  and  Dr.  Hansman,  we
will have your testimony as soon as we return from this recess. We
will recess until approximately five minutes after the last vote.

because  a  university  professor  these  days  should  have  to  have
slides to talk.

This  is  a  picture  that  shows  the  U.S.  air  traffic  density  over  the
U.S.,  which  shows  the  dependence  of  the  U.S.  economy  on  air
transportation. This is a little macro scale conceptual model we use
that show the dependence of the economy on the air transportation
system, both the capability of the national airspace system, our in-
frastructure,  and  also,  the  capability  of  the  vehicles  that  are  in
there.

As people have mentioned today, the U.S. aviation impact is esti-
mated at about eight percent of the Gross Domestic Product, rough-
ly  100  million,  correction,  10  million  jobs,  and  about  $900  billion
per  year  to  the  U.S.  economy.  This  shows  you  the  growth  of  pas-
senger traffic by region, showing the U.S. is—has been growing ex-
ponentially in passenger traffic as well as Europe and Asia Pacific.
You can see the latent demand, which hasn’t emerged yet, in other
parts  of  the  world.  This  shows  you  the  freight  demand,  and  shows
you  that  the  freight  out  of  Asia  actually  exceeded  the  freight  out
of the U.S., starting in the 1990s. So, you can see that dependence
on the economy.

Talking about challenges and opportunities, I will just quickly go
through  one—a  few  of  them.  Let  me  start  with  flight  delays  and
the  capacity  of  the  air  traffic—air  transportation  system.  Before
the  attacks  of  September  11,  in  the  years  2000,  2001,  air  traffic
control delays were an emergent and critical problem. Even in this
body,  people  were  very  upset,  concerned  about  it.  The  system  was
close  to  saturation.  The  attacks  of  September  11  pulled  down  de-
mand  on  the  system  for  a  few  years.  Demand  has  come  back  into
the  system,  and  you  can  see,  starting  in  late  2003  and  through
2004,  the  delays  in  the  system  have  actually  exceeded  historical
levels.

The  capacity  of  the  system  is  limited  by  the—fundamentally  in
the  U.S.,  the  capacity  of  the  airports  and  runways,  although  it  is
also the airspace system, the complexity, the people to run the sys-
tem,  and  the  technical  elements  of  the  system.  These  are  going  to
be urgent issues in the future, and we actually project that the sys-
tem  will  go  into  gridlock,  probably  in  the  summer  either  of  2007
or 2008, and we will see issues emerging next summer.

Another  factor  is  the  economic  instability  in  the  industry.  This
shows  you  the  net  U.S.  airline  profits,  as  a  function  of  time,  start-
ing with deregulation in 1978. You can see that the industry is cy-
clic,  with  about  an  11  year  cycle.  And  the  amplitude  of  the  cycle
has been growing with time. This is actually—appears to be a fun-
damental  effect,  not  directly  attributable  to  September  11,  which
exacerbated the situation.

Another  clear  and  emergent  issue  will  be  fuel  availability  and
price  of  fuel.  As  you  know,  fuel  at  the  crude  level  has  gone  over
$50 a barrel. This appears to reflect a secular trend. As fuel prices
go up, this will be actually a technical opportunity to look for more
efficient means, more efficient aircraft, will actually provide an op-
portunity  to  renew  aircraft  in  the  system,  and  also,  the  aerospace
industry,  because  of  its  nature,  worrying  about  efficiency,  will  pro-
vide  a  technical  conduit  for  technologies  to  come  out  of  aviation
into other modes, such as ground vehicles.

Environmental  limitations  are  going  to  be  critical.  We  already
know the noises are a critical issue which limits our ability to add
airports  and  runways  to  the  system.  Emissions  are  becoming  a
more  important  problem,  both  in  local  emissions,  but  also  global
emissions.  Also,  interestingly,  effects  such  as  contrails  are  now
starting  to  be  looked  at  as  significant  factors  on  influencing  the
global radiative balance and global warning.

International—this  industry  is  clearly  an  international  industry,
and  that  is  both  an  opportunity,  in  terms  of  future  markets,  but
it is also, as has been said earlier today, an issue in terms of chal-
lengers. People mention the Airbus A380. This is the rollout of the
A380,  expected  to  fly  later  this  year.  It  is  an  interesting  airplane,
and  again,  it  is  enabled  by  some  of  the  technical  investments  in
Europe, but it is not just Europe. It is—we have significant growth
in  midsized  jets  and  regional  jets.  These  are  the  new  airplanes
coming out of Brazil, the Embraer 190 and 170 series. Out of Can-
ada, the CRJ–900 series, and actually, out of China, on a midlevel,
regional jets, and this is expected to be one of the big growth mar-
kets. We do have innovation in the U.S., in a number of ways, this
is a picture of the Boeing 77. I just note it, because it is in the Jap-
anese  livery,  which  were  the—one  of  the  launch  customers.  So,
again,  points  to  the  issue  as  this  being  an  international  industry
and international markets, which we have to compete in.

The  biggest  challenge  and  my  biggest  concern  is  actually  in  our
intellectual  capital,  not  just  in  NASA,  which  was  talked  about
today,  but  really,  in  the  country  at  large.  In  my  business,  you
know,  we  look  at  students  flowing  into  the  system,  go—you  know,
I actually teach a lot of those what were called nerds this morning.
Okay.  And  they  are  not  really  nerds.  The  concern  I  have  is  that
the talent and experience really isn’t being replaced. Right now, we
are  getting  competition  from  other  fields,  information  technology,

biotechnology, bioengineering, and we are also getting, as we know,
international competition, so you know, one has to ask, why would
a  young  person  go  into  aeronautics,  except  for  their  love  of  flying
or flight?

Another  issue  that  we  deal  with  is  changing  skill  requirements,
so  that  the  skills  that  we  are  going  to  need  for  aeronautics  in  the
future are not the same skills that we have needed in the past. In
terms  of  NASA’s  role,  they  have  a  critical  role  in  developing  the
knowledge  base,  technologies,  and  people,  and  stimulating  innova-
tion,  fostering  growth  of  talent,  and  their  critical  role  in  reducing
the technical risk in the systems.

They  have  been  historically  invaluable.  I  actually  took  off  my
bookshelf a book that one of my mentors gave me, which is Abbott
and  van  Doenhoff,  all  these  guys  will  know  this  book,  okay.  These
were  the  original  work  out  at  NACA,  these  were  the  wind  tunnel
data of airfoil geometry which are still used today, and sort of rep-
resent the fundamental type of knowledge we should be generating
out at NASA. There currently is, people have said, sub-critical. The
programs  are  aligned  with  some  of  the  future  needs,  but  are  inad-
equate  from  the  core  standpoint.  The  budget  and  the  trend  in  the
budget is inadequate to maintain a vital national aeronautics capa-
bility  that  we  must  have.  The  working  budget,  the  amount  of
money that is really available for innovation, creativity, and excite-
ment,  just  isn’t  there.  Okay.  And  this  will  have  an  adverse  impact
on  the  intellectual  capital  to  meet  future  challenges.  Again,  why
would you recommend that your son or daughter go into the indus-
try?

What  can  the  government  do?  The  government  should  invest  in
aeronautics,  for  the  future,  and  not  coast  on  the  prior  momentum.
NASA  should  take  more  risks,  and  should  increase  investment  in
developing  opportunities  that  will  attract  excitement  and  talent  to
aeronautics. We need a fundamental research core in the portfolio,
and this is going to require additional investment and collaboration
with government agencies and industry, and there are some efforts,
such as the JPDO, that are a good start.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF R. JOHN HANSMAN, JR.

Chairman Calvert and Members of the Subcommittee:

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on The Future of Aeronautics at NASA.
For  most  of  the  past  century,  the  U.S.  has  led  the  world  in  ‘‘pushing  the  edge  of
the  aeronautics  envelope’’  based,  in  part,  on  a  strong  national  aeronautics  research
strategy. This has resulted in a vibrant aerospace industry and an unsurpassed air
transportation system which has contributed materially to the Nation’s economic de-
velopment,  geographic  structure  and  quality  of  life.  The  social  and  economic
connectivity  provided  by  our  air  transportation  system  can  bee  seen  in  the  density
of aircraft trajectories over the U.S. (Fig 1.).

There  are,  however,  indications  that  the  U.S.  preeminence  in  aerospace  has  de-
clined.  In  part  this  is  due  to  strategic  investments  other  nations  have  made,  and
continue  to  make,  in  aeronautics  research.  These  investments  in  programs  and,
more  importantly,  in  people,  have  created  a  strong  international  civil  aeronautics
capability. In contrast the U.S. has systematically decreased it’s investment in civil
aeronautics  research  over  the  past  decade  and  has  underinvested  in  fundamental
and  high  risk  research  to  develop  the  excitement  knowledge  and  people  to  shape
aeronautics in the future.

I  will  comment  below  on  the  specific  questions  which  you  have  asked  me  to  ad-

dress.
Over  the  next  two  decades,  what  are  the  main  challenges  facing  the  aero-
nautics  industry  and  our  aviation  infrastructure?  What  are  the  Nation’s
most pressing strategic needs in civil aeronautics?

National  Airspace  System  Capacity—Indications  of  the  capacity  problem  can  be
seen  in  the  delay  data  of  Figure  2.  Prior  to  September  11,  2001,  the  system  was
approaching capacity limits at key airports and other points in the system. Nominal
interruptions resulted due to weather or traffic congestion in non-linear propagation
of delays and loss of reliability in the system. Delays were reduced after September
11 due primarily to reduced traffic. However traffic has returned and delays in late
2004 have exceed historic levels. This pattern is expected to continue and it is likely
that  delays  will  reach  crisis  proportions  within  the  ext  few  years.  It  is  important
to  note  that  key  airports  in  the  system  (e.g.,  LGA  and  ORD)  have  had  a  dispropor-
tional impact on national delays illustrating the importance of getting maximum ca-
pacity  from  our  airports  and  reducing  local  environmental  impacts  to  reduce  local
community opposition to airport capacity expansion.

106

Economic Stability—The economic instability of the aeronautics industry can been
seen  in  the  aggregate  profitability  of  the  U.S.  airlines  (Fig.  3).  The  cyclic  nature  of
the  industry  can  be  seen  with  the  cycle  period  being  approximately  11  years.  Prior
to  deregulation  of  the  industry  in  1978  the  Airline  Industry  was  cyclic  but  profit-
able. After de-regulation the amplitude of the oscillation has increased. This pattern
is also seen globally. It is unclear what will limit the growth of this instability, how-
ever the implications are significant both for the industry, the Nation and the world.

Fuel—Another challenge will be the price and availability of fuel. As can be seen
in  Fig.  4,  the  price  of  fuel  recently  exceed  $50  per  barrel.  While  this  is  partly  due
to  short  term  issues  it  is  expected  that  fuel  prices  will  continue  to  rise  as  the  rate
of  discovery  of  new  fossil  fuel  sources  slows.  While  this  is  a  challenge,  it  is  also  a
technical opportunity as it shifts the design criteria to value fuel efficiency.

107

International  Competition  and  Markets—International  competition  will  also  be  a
key challenge over the next few years. As noted above, international competition to
U.S. manufactured aircraft and aeronautics technologies have increased and the his-
torical  U.S.  leadership  has  diminished.  However,  the  international  markets  rep-
resent  the  largest  future  opportunities  for  civil  aeronautics  products  and  systems.
This  can  bee  seen  in  Figures  5  and  6  which  show  the  rapid  growth  in  passenger
and  freight  traffic  in  North  America,  Europe,  and  Asia  and  the  emergent  potential
of developing regions such as the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa.

108

Environmental Impact—Environmental issues will become increasingly important
challenges  to  aviation  as  well  as  other  segments  of  society.  At  the  local  level,  noise
and  emissions  make  it  difficult  to  add  runway  capacity  to  meet  the  traffic  demand.
On  a  global  scale,  increasing  concerns  regarding  global  warming  will  impose  limits
on high altitude emissions and aircraft contrails which impact the earth’s radiative
energy balance.

Security and Public Health Threats—The perception as aviation as a potential so-
cial threat mechanism could significantly constrain the potential benefits from avia-
tion and the aeronautics industry. As important as the well publicized security con-
cerns  is  the  bio-propagation  of  natural  health  threats  as  illustrated  by  the  reaction
to  the  SARs  virus  in  Asia.  While  these  concerns  are  real  the  potential  to  overreact
are significant.

Information  Technology  and  Complexity—On  the  technology  side,  one  of  the  key
challenges will be dealing with complexity and criticality in Information Technology
and software systems which are an increasingly important part of all aerospace sys-
tems.

Human  Roles—Defining  the  limits  of  automation  and  the  role  of  the  human  will
be  a  challenge  for  civil  aviation.  Unmanned  Air  Vehicles  have  demonstrated  their
capability in military applications and are emerging in civil aviation. The future role
of  humans  both  as  operators  and  controllers  will  change  and  become  an  emergent
issue.

Loss  of  Intellectual  Capital—Perhaps  the  most  important  challenge  is  the  poten-
tial  decline  of  intellectual  capital  in  the  U.S.  Aeronautics  enterprise.  Much  of  the
historical  strength  in  aeronautics  was  due  to  the  knowledge  and  expertise  in  our
people.  Currently  we  are  not  stimulating  intellectual  renewal  at  a  pace  which  will
maintain or increase the national capability to deal with the challenges ahead.
What role do NASA’s aeronautics programs and strategic plans have in ful-
filling  the  Nation’s  strategic  needs  in  civil  aeronautics?  How  effective  are
NASA’s  programs  in  helping  to  ensure  U.S.  industrial  competitiveness  in
civil aeronautics markets worldwide?

There is clearly an urgent strategic need to invigorate aeronautics research in the
U.S.  to  meet  the  challenges  of  the  future.  As  the  national  agency  for  civil  aero-
nautics  research  NASA  should  have  a  key  role.  However  the  lack  of  prioritization
of aeronautics within NASA puts this at risk.

109

Given  the  limited  budget  for  aeronautics,  the  aeronautics  programs  are  generally
aligned  with  a  subset  of  the  strategic  needs  but  are  unlikely  to  be  as  innovative  or
as  effective  as  necessary  to  have  a  major  impact  on  U.S  industrial  competitiveness
in civil aeronautics.

I  am  somewhat  concerned  that  budget  pressure  and  internal  evaluation  metrics
have  created  an  environment  where  the  aeronautics  research  efforts  are  too  short-
term  focused  on  products  and  programs  and  not  enough  on  knowledge  and  capa-
bility which are the critical enablers for the long-term competitiveness.

Regarding the three specific NASA Aeronautics Programs:
The Airspace Systems Program is well aligned with the future capacity challenges
to  the  National  Airspace  System  (NAS)  although  somewhat  too  focused  on  devel-
oping  specific  solutions  rather  than  general  capabilities  which  can  be  used  to  ad-
dress future challenges as they emerge. It is important to recognize that NASA does
not  implement  airspace  systems  and  must  work  collaboratively  with  the  FAA  and
other  government  agencies  as  well  as  industry  and  international  agencies  in  order
to  be  effective.  To  this  end,  I  am  encouraged  by  NASA’s  strong  involvement  with
the Joint Program and Development Office (JPDO).

The  Aviation  Safety  and  Security  Program  supports  the  noble  goal  of  increasing
aviation  safety.  The  safety  element  of  the  program  is  based  on  a  well  developed
identification  of  key  safety  issues.  The  program  appears  to  be  open  to  innovation.
The one area which appears under-represented are issues related to critical software
and complexity related emergent safety issues. I am less clear what the appropriate
NASA role is in aviation security and am therefore concerned that the security ele-
ment  of  the  program  may  be  diverting  scarce  resources  from  other  efforts.  Again,
I  am  encouraged  that  the  JPDO  will  be  a  mechanism  to  clarify  the  NASA  role  in
aviation security.

The  Vehicle  Systems  Program  has  been  refocused  around  four  technology  dem-
onstration  projects  (Subsonic  Noise  Reduction,  Sonic  Boom  Reduction,  Zero  Emis-
sions Aircraft, and High Altitude Long Duration Remotely Operated Aircraft). Each
of these programs address expected future challenges and their priority has emerged
from a collaborative interaction with industry. There is, however, a general concern
that  the  focus  on  technology  demonstrations  comes  at  the  expense  of  more  funda-
mental  research  and  core  technology  development  in  vehicle  systems  and  that  the
national competitiveness in aircraft technologies may atrophy as a result.
What  effect  do  you  believe  NASA’s  proposed  budget  (including  proposed
changes in funding, workforce, and operation of wind tunnels) will have on
its ability to meet the Nation’s strategic needs in civil aeronautics?

I am generally dismayed by the magnitude and trend of the proposed NASA aero-
nautics  budget.  It  appears  to  reflect  a  lack  of  commitment  of  the  Agency  to  the  fu-
ture of aeronautics.

Given the reduced level of investment in the Aeronautics Theme, NASA has done
a  reasonable  job  at  prioritizing  facilities  and  has  recognized  the  need  to  align  it’s
workforce  to  the  challenges  of  the  future.  While  there  is  clearly  a  need  to  reduce
the number of NASA facilities, this must be done carefully and with a strategic na-
tional  perspective.  If  done  correctly  the  Nation’s  future  strategic  needs  will  be  met.
I  am  more  concerned  regarding  the  ability  of  NASA  to  maintain  a  talented  and
enthusiastic  workforce  with  the  skills  and  interest  to  meet  the  challenges  in  civil
aeronautics. The workforce actions, appear to motivated by budget pressures rather
than  strategic  efforts  at  intellectual  renewal.  This  coupled  with  a  perception  of  de-
clining NASA priority in aeronautics, can create an atmosphere where it is difficult
to retain and attract the best and the brightest.

I am also concerned that the declining aeronautics budget coupled with fixed obli-
gations  and  congressionally  mandated  earmarks  have  reduced  the  ability  of  the
NASA  aeronautics  program  to  pursue  innovative  new  ideas  and  emergent  research
needs.
What steps should the government take to better address the Nation’s stra-
tegic  civil  aeronautics  needs?  If  continued  research  has  an  important  role
to  play,  what  should  be  its  priorities?  How  do  you  recommend  NASA  bal-
ance  investment  in  evolutionary  research  against  revolutionary,  high-risk,
high-payoff research?

I believe that the Nation must recognize the civil and military importance of aero-
nautics and commit to maintaining the health and vitality of the national capability
in  aeronautics.  A  vital  element  of  this  capability  is  a  healthy  research  program
which  builds  core  knowledge,  stimulates  innovation,  builds  intellectual  capital,  cre-
ates  opportunity  and  solves  emergent  problems  in  the  civil  air  transportation  sys-
tem.

I  believe  that  NASA  is  most  effective  when  it  focuses  on  fundamental  issues  and
longer-term  innovative  research  and  hands  of  the  results  to  industry  or  the  oper-
ating agencies such as FAA to implement. To this end NASA must continue to build
close  ties  to  industry  and  other  government  agencies.  The  JPDO  has  the  potential
to be a conduit for this collaboration.

In  terms  of  priority,  I  would  focus  on  building  the  knowledge  base  and  national

workforce to address the challenges to civil aeronautics identified above.

vation.

To this end, I would urge NASA to take more risks and to actively stimulate inno-

I would also urge NASA to increase the opportunity space in aeronautics for new
faculty  and  students  through  an  increased  focus  on  small  single  investigator,
projects or grants. The investment is not large but the potential for innovation and
growth of the Nation’s capability is huge.

DISCUSSION

AERONAUTICS PLANNING: BUDGET VS. PRIORITIES

Chairman  CALVERT.  Let’s  get  into  the  question  part  of  the  hear-
ing. When I was in business, years ago, we would obviously put to-
gether  a  business  plan,  and  that  would  drive  our  number  of  jobs,
our capital outlays, and our budget.

We would make a determination at that point what would occur.
It seems, sometimes, as I listen through this, that the job level and
the budget is driving the business plan here some, to some degree.
And that the budget right now is the determining factor.

Dr. Lebacqz, how would you evaluate the ’06 aeronautics budget?

Does it match the priorities of the Nation, in your opinion?

Dr.  LEBACQZ.  Sir,  let  me  start  by  talking  about  the  way  that
NASA  develops  a  business  plan,  which  of  course,  is  different  than
you would have done, but is consistent with the way we developed
the  budget.  We  are,  in  fact,  engaged  in  a  road  mapping  activity,
across the entire Agency. We have developed 18, I believe the num-
ber  is,  strategic  objectives  for  the  Agency,  and  there  are  13  road-
maps that are intended to be long-term guideposts to achieve those
13—those objectives.

One  of  those  roadmaps  is  in  aeronautics.  It  is  co-chaired  by  my
Deputy  for  Technology,  who  is  here  behind  me,  Mr.  Terry  Hertz,
as well as the Chief Technology Officer of the Boeing Company, Mr.
Jim Jamieson. We use that, in conjunction with a lot of other guid-
ance  that  we  get  from  the  aerospace,  the  President’s  Commission
on  the  Future  of  Aerospace,  from  the  National  Research  Council,
both their prospective studies, such as ‘‘Securing the Future of U.S.
Air Transportation,’’ as well as the reviews of our program that my

friend and colleague, Dr. Klineberg, talked about, to develop the as-
pects of the roadmap. From that, in principle, we then derive budg-
etary requirements to achieve the goals of the roadmap.

Chairman CALVERT. Well, what—before I get into that, why don’t
we  allow  the  other  panel  to  answer  that  question  also.  I—Dr.
Klineberg,  I  think  you  probably  answered  that  question  in  your
opening remarks, but you can do it again.

Does  the  aeronautics  budget,  in  your  opinion,  match  the  prior-

ities of the Nation?

Dr.  KLINEBERG.  I  think  you  are  right,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  the
budget  is  driving  the  strategic  plan,  and  not  the  other  way,  and  I
don’t think that is right. So, my answer would be no, that it is not
satisfying  the  needs  of  the  country,  because  we  haven’t  really
looked  hard  at  what  those  aeronautics  needs  are,  separately  from
the  budget,  and  I  think  my  colleagues  have  talked  to  what  some
of those needs are, and need to be addressed.

Chairman CALVERT. Dr. Anto´n.
Dr.  ANTO´ N.  I  am  probably  the  most  qualified  to  talk  about  the
infrastructure  needs,  and  from  that  perspective,  no,  there  has  not
been an identification, as of yet, of assured support for those facili-
ties that are needed from a national perspective.

Chairman CALVERT. Dr. Benzakein.
Dr.  BENZAKEIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  we—some  of  us  are
agreed  that  it  looks  like  the  budget  is  driving  the  agenda,  which
is really, in our opinion, the wrong way to go.

There  is  unfortunately,  and  I  think  some  of  our  colleagues  said
the  same  thing,  we  do  need  an  aeronautics  mission,  an  agenda,
agreed  to.  And  then,  after  that,  you  can  put  a  budget  around  it.
Here,  it  seems  to  say  there  are  that  many,  that  much  funding
available, and then, a mission gets wrapped around it. That is real-
ly, in our opinion, in my opinion, the wrong way to go.

Chairman CALVERT. Dr. Hansman.
Dr. HANSMAN. The simple answer is no.

ZERO BASE REVIEW

Chairman CALVERT. The Navy has just gone through a zero base
review on their operations, the United States Navy, and they have
done  quite,  for  the  Navy,  quite  a  radical  change,  where  how  they
utilize their personnel, how they utilize their fixed assets, how they
utilize  ships,  equipment,  et  cetera.  Dr.  Lebacqz,  do  you  see  NASA
going  through  that  same  type  of  exercise,  in  order  to  get  as  much
efficiency  and  economy  and  productivity  out  of  its  working  force?
Dr. LEBACQZ. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question. What we have
done  this  year,  effective  the  beginning  of  February,  is  focusing  on
one set of—one part of our infrastructure, which is our set of wind
tunnels.  We  have  corporatized,  so  to  speak,  management  of  them.
I  noticed  earlier  in  speech,  in  some  of  the  other  testimony  today,
that people would talk about the Langley such and such tunnel, or
the  Glenn  such  and  such  tunnel.  They  are  NASA  tunnels,  and  so,
we  have  brought  the  management  of  them  back  to  headquarters,
under  a  program  manager,  who  is  responsible  across  all  of  the
wind  tunnels,  for  assessing  the  pricing  policy,  assessing  the  de-
mand, because these are, after all, demand-driven facilities.

Somewhat  similar  to  other  zero  base  reviews,  we  are  trying  to
understand  what  the  demand  will  be  for  them  from  our  own  pro-
grams,  what  the  demand  will  be  for  them  from  other  programs
within  NASA,  and  what  the  demand  for  them  will  be  from  the  in-
dustry,  and  our  colleagues  in  other  agencies.  The  folks,  good  folks
at  the  RAND  Corporation,  in  the  study  that  Dr.  Anto´n  mentioned,
talked,  provided  sort  of  a  process  to  go  through,  in  which  one  can
prioritize against a set of criteria the need for some of these facili-
ties,  and  as  Dr.  Anto´n  mentioned,  they  came  up  with  roughly  31,
or  29,  I  can’t  quite  get  the  number  straight  in  my  head,  of  the
NASA  facilities  that  has  some  need,  and  nine  of  them,  in  their
view, are critical, based on this process.

We will be doing that again, given the fact that the environment
is  different  now  than  it  was  three  years  ago,  when  the  study  was
initiated.  But  using  the  same  process,  but  at  a  corporate  level,
rather  than  at  an  individual  center  level,  because  in  those  cases,
one  tends  to  sub-optimize.  There  are  a  number  of  ways,  if  I  could
go on briefly, a number of ways here that these facilities can be op-
erated differently than they are now.

One  of  them  is  through  some  kind  of  shared  ownership,  shared
pricing.  One  of  them  is  through  transfer  of  some  of  them  to  other
entities  that  need  them.  We  are  investigating  that  currently,  with
one of the big tunnels at the Ames Research Center, with the DOD,
as a matter of fact. Another of them is to, if we can corporatize how
we operate them, operate them differently than we have. For exam-
ple,  take  an  idea  from  the  Navy,  of  having  a  cadre  of  people  who
are  capable  of  operating  all  the  facilities,  and  move  them  phys-
ically, as needed, to the facility that is required.

So, all of these things are in play, and that is the purpose of this
corporatizing  of  the  program  this  year.  We  are  going  to  identify
some  money  that  we  will  pull  out  into  a  separate  program,  to  give
this  program  manager  some  leverage.  It  is  the  government.  You
have got to follow the money, so you need some leverage.

NUMBER OF WIND TUNNELS NEEDED

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  want  to  turn  it  over  to  Mr.  Udall  for  his
question, but while we are on the subject of wind tunnels, and how
many  wind  tunnels  we  need,  and  how  many  tunnels  need  to  be
closed,  is  that  decision  based  upon  utilization,  or  is  that  decision
based  upon—maybe  Dr.  Anto´n,  you  could  answer  that  briefly,  and
how did you arrive at the 28 versus 30 or 29 or whatever?
Dr.  ANTO´ N.  We  found  in  our  research  that  utilization  data  was
very  difficult  to  project  into  the  future,  and  so,  we  took  a  much
more  strategic  look  at  trying  to  understand  the  kinds  of  vehicles
that——

zation.

Chairman  CALVERT.  So,  if  you  have  a  tunnel  that  has  zero  utili-
Dr. ANTO´ N. Yes.
Chairman CALVERT. It still has value in your mind?
Dr.  ANTO´ N.  Yes.  The  question  is  what  kinds  of  future  vehicles
might need that kind of capability. So, for example, the hypersonics
program in the country has gone down, but——

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  understand  that  from  the  manager’s  point
of view, Dr. Lebacqz’s point of view, if—going back to the old busi-

ness model. If you have zero utilization, but you have an asset that
may have potentiality——

Dr. ANTO´ N. Yes.
Chairman  CALVERT.—how  do  you  manage  that  asset?  And  I
guess that is something that has to be worked out, but I am going
to—but I just—trying to understand how you are determining what
has  future  value  to  hold,  and  what  should  be  closed,  or  what
shouldn’t be closed. With that, Mr. Udall.

CREDIBILITY OF NASA’S AERONAUTICS PLAN

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  think  this  line  of  ques-
tioning  is  important  to  pursue  later.  I  want  to  just  start.  First,  I
want  to  thank  the  panel,  and  also,  ask  your  forgiveness  for  the
break in the action, but I appreciate you being willing to stay with
us, because this is a very crucial area that we are discussing today.
Dr. Lebacqz, your testimony, along with that provided with other
witnesses,  makes  a  persuasive  case  for  the  importance  of  aero-
nautics  research.  I  enjoyed  looking  at  your  bio.  You  have  a  long
and  distinguished  career  in  aeronautics  research.  And  as  I  men-
tioned  in  my  opening  remarks,  you  are  obligated  to  put  the  best
face  on  what  I  think  is  a  bleak  situation  that  NASA’s  aeronautics
program faces.

’06  budget  eliminates 

I have to tell you, I find a real disconnect between the NASA tes-
timony  and  the  actual  situation.  The  paragraphs  of  your—initial
paragraphs of your written statement talk about the great promise
of  hypersonics,  yet  the 
for
hypersonics. The testimony talks about the importance of the Avia-
tion Safety and Security Program, yet that budget for that program
will  be  lower  in  2010  than  it  was  in  Fiscal  Year  2004.  The  testi-
mony  makes  a  strong  case  for  the  critical  need  to  modernize  the
Nation’s  air  transportation  system,  yet  funding  for  Airspace  Sys-
tems  would  decline  by  22  percent  from  fiscal  ’04  levels.  Finally,
your  testimony  makes  a  case  for  pursuing  flight  demonstrations  of
breakthrough  technologies  in  four  areas,  and  yet,  the  funding  for
the  Vehicle  Systems  will  be  43  percent  lower  in  2010  than  it  was
in ’04. That is even though, and my understanding, the flight dem-
onstrations are the most expensive part of the R&D cycle.

funding 

I  have  to  confess,  the  plan  doesn’t  appear  credible  to  me,  and  I
know  what  your  official  position  has  to  be,  but  speaking  as  an  ex-
perienced  professional  in  aeronautics  research,  do  you  consider  it
to be a credible and sustainable plan for the long term? That is my
first question.

I  want  to  ask  two  more.  What  will  the  consequences  for  the  fu-
ture  of  NASA’s  aeronautics  program  be  if  the  funding  and  work-
force and infrastructure reductions contained in the five-year budg-
et  plan  actually  come  to  pass?  And  then  I  would  like  to  ask  the
other  witnesses  if  they  would  like  to  make  any  comments,  Doctor,
after you make yours.

Dr.  LEBACQZ.  There  is  a  lot  of  points  in  your  question  there,  so
maybe  I  can  kind  of  get  at  it  from  the  back  end  toward  the  front.

Mr. UDALL. I apologize for throwing all that at you.
Dr.  LEBACQZ.  No,  that  is  all  right.  I  am  supposed  to  be  a  rocket
scientist. I ought to be able to remember it. I just can’t. So, let me
start, I think a critical point of your question has to do with wheth-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:40 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 020007 PO 00000 Frm 00117 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\031605\20007 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

114

er  the  Vehicle  Systems  program  being  shrunk  by  40  percent,  with
these four demonstrations, is a credible program, in my estimation.
The Vehicle Systems program has been refocused from a program
that  was  based  on  a  number  of  disciplinary  activities,  and  sort  of
the  classic  disciplines  of  aerodynamics,  avionics,  materials  and
structures, propulsion, that were applicable to a wide range of vehi-
cles,  which  the  four  that  we  have  selected  were  some.  There  were,
I  believe,  seven  concept  vehicles  that  we  were  doing  this  research
for.

So,  I  believe  that,  particularly—let  me  pick  the—I  didn’t  really
have  a  chance  to  talk  about  them,  one  of  the  demonstrations  is  a
flight  demonstration  of  reducing  subsonic  noise.  That  actually  is  a
continuation  and  completion  of  work  that  we  had  initiated,  and  I
don’t  think  there  is  any  question  but  that  we  will  accomplish  that
in  roughly  fiscal  ’08.  Another  one  of  them  is  the  development  of
high altitude, long endurance, remotely operated or autonomous ve-
hicles for science platforms. We have research underway currently,
and  in  fact,  we  have  built  vehicles  that  are  the  beginnings  of  this
type  of  thing,  with  the  Helios  vehicle.  I  think  that  one  is  also  do-
able within the amount of money that we are talking about.

Because  we  are  not  doing  research  that  is  applicable  to  more
than  just  it,  as  well  as  a  number  of  other  things,  we  are  focusing
the  research  on  just  it.  So,  I  think  in  general,  that  the—that  pro-
gram is credible. I suspect my colleagues won’t agree with me, but
I believe that program is credible. But the concerns that you raised
about  the  Safety  and  Security  program  and  the  Airspace  Systems
program,  I  think  are  good  concerns.  We  believe  strongly,  and  in
fact,  it  is  interesting,  the  NASA  aeronautics  portfolio,  percentage-
wise  now,  compared  now  to  10  years  ago,  is  almost  50  percent  on
these  systems  kinds  of  research,  airspace  systems,  systems  that
provide more security, more safety in the airplane, and only 50 per-
cent on sort of our classic vehicle research.

We believe that what we have planned out in those areas is, will
make  a  significant  contribution.  We  support  entirely  the  Joint
Planning and Development Office, which—the NASA, the FAA, the
DOT, the DOD, the Department of Homeland Security, Department
of Commerce, Interagency Working Group, that has been our high-
est  priority  all  along,  and  will  continue  to  be,  to  make  sure  that
the national plan for a transformation of the national airspace sys-
tem will occur, and that we have research to support that.

Maybe I over-answered a long question.
Mr. UDALL. I created the problem by asking a long question, and
you did a very nice job of responding to me, the questions I asked,
and the points I made.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  see  my  time  has  expired.  Perhaps  the  other
panelists could—if we don’t have a second round, you could respond
in writing to my question. But let us see how the questioning goes
from this point on. I think, because Mr. Forbes is here, I don’t want
to take from this time.

Chairman  CALVERT.  We  are  going  to  have  a  lot  of  time  for  an-

other round of questions, so—Mr. Forbes, you are recognized.

Mr.  FORBES.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  thank  all  of  the
members  of  the  panel,  and  the  toughest  thing,  for  me,  in  going
through  these  budgets,  is  it  is  so  hard  for  us  to  get  somebody  to

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:40 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 020007 PO 00000 Frm 00118 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\031605\20007 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

115

just walk in here and say that building costs $10 million. We need
it, but we can’t afford it. So, what we see in the budget is that we
are going to put up a tent, and then, we have to figure out whether
the  tent  is  really  going  to  suffice,  or  whether  you  are  just  trying
to not tell us you are not going to build the building.

U.S. COMPETITIVENESS AND THE AERONAUTIC BUDGET

And when I look at your five-year budget runout for aeronautics
in fiscal year 2006, and I compare that with the one submitted last
year,  it  looks  like  we  got  a  $738  million  shortfall  from  fiscal  year
2005  to  fiscal  year  2009  timeframe.  Now,  when  I  look  at  our  mar-
ket  share  dropping  in  aeronautics,  as  we  have  talked  about.  25
years ago, we were at 90 percent. 10 years ago, 70 percent. Today,
we are at 47 percent, and we hear what our friends in Europe are
saying,  they  want  to  dominate  aviation  sales  by  2020.  Are  we  just
retreating,  and  just  saying  okay,  we  understand  we  are  going  to
lose  that  battle,  and  we  are  not  going  to  go  after  it?  How  do  these
numbers  tell  us  we  are  really  making  a  stab  to  stay  competitive?
Dr.  LEBACQZ.  If  I  could  answer  that  the  way  that  I  did  in  my
opening  statement,  I  believe  we  need  a  national  dialogue  on  that
very issue. We need to decide whether we will have a policy in aer-
onautics that is consistent with either side of the discussion.

Mr. FORBES. But does this budget do that? Does this budget——
Dr. LEBACQZ. This budget is——
Mr. FORBES.—not the dialogue, but does it——
Dr. LEBACQZ. This budget is consistent with one side of the policy

issue that I raised.

Mr. FORBES. Which is what side?
Dr.  LEBACQZ.  The  side  that  says  that  the  marketplace  will,  in

fact, provide the best outcome.

Mr.  FORBES.  But  the  marketplace  has  not  done  that  for  the  last

25 years, has it?

Dr. LEBACQZ. That would not be up to me answer, sir.
WORKFORCE AT LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER

Mr.  FORBES.  The  other  question  I  would  have  for  you  is,  has
NASA  decided  internally  that  the  Langley  Research  Center  in
Hampton is going to be closed?

Dr. LEBACQZ. No, sir.
Mr. FORBES. If they haven’t, then how do we explain to the work-
ers  there  and  the  people  there,  when  you  get  these  cuts  from  804,
$105 million, fiscal year 2005, $668, fiscal year 2006, $557, and fis-
cal year 2007, $479. How do we communicate to the engineers and
the workforce that we are not trying to gut the program there, and
force  these  engineers  out?  Because  that  is  at  least  the  impression
that has come across when you just look at the raw numbers of the
budget.

Dr. LEBACQZ. Congressman, as you know, there are four mission
directorates  within  NASA,  of  which  Aeronautics  is  one.  Space  Op-
erations,  there  is  Exploration  Systems,  and  there  is  Science.  We
have,  in  Aeronautics,  $100  million  less  in  fiscal  ’06,  and  $200  mil-
lion,  roughly,  less,  starting  in  fiscal  ’07  and  out.  That  is  less  fund-
ing for work in aeronautics, and so, the centers have made an esti-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:40 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 020007 PO 00000 Frm 00119 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\031605\20007 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

116

mate of what that means to people who work, were working in aer-
onautics  at  the  centers.  But  that  does  not  necessarily  mean  that
those people won’t be doing other parts of the NASA mission. They
just won’t be working on this part.

Mr.  FORBES.  And  one  last  question.  As  you  know,  the  detailed
NASA  budget  justification  for  each  program  has  a  section  entitled
risk  management,  which  describes  the  possible  factors  that  could
impede  the  progress  on  each  project,  and  I  am  concerned  by  the
fact that the following two risks are cited only for aeronautics pro-
grams  and  no  other  NASA  programs  in  this  budget.  The  first  one
is, it says risk: ‘‘Given the loss of critical workforce skills, facilities,
there is the possibility that costs and schedule may be impeached.’’
The  second  one,  it  says  risk:  ‘‘Given  the  possibility  that  competing
funding requirements draw funding away from research and devel-
opment,  there  is  a  high  probability  that  project  activities  may  be
de-scoped  or  eliminated.’’  In  the  first  case,  there  seems  to  indicate
that  NASA  believes  the  centers  that  perform  this  work,  which  are
mostly in Langley and Glenn, will lose workforce, skills, and facili-
ties, because of these budget cuts. And the second case, I was hop-
ing  you  could  maybe  enlighten  me  on  what  it  means  when  it  says
competing  funding  requirements  that  draw  funding  away.  What
does  that  refer  to?  Does  that—I  assume  it  must  mean  the  Space
Exploration Initiative, but——

Dr. LEBACQZ. No, sir. I think what that is referring to, and I am
embarrassed  that  I  don’t  actually  know  by  heart  what  you  are
reading  from.  I  believe  what  that  is  referring  to  is  within  our  pro-
grams, we will use more full and open competition, collaboratively,
among  the  centers  and  the  industry  than  we  have  in  the  past.  We
have  tended  to  use  so-called  directed  research,  that  goes  to  a  cen-
ter,  and  then,  the  center  decides  to  do  with  it.  We  will  be  doing
that in a different fashion, similar to the way that our Science Mis-
sion  Directorate,  and  our  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate
operates.

Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman.
Dr. LEBACQZ. That is what they are talking about.
Mr.  FORBES.  My  time  is  up,  but  maybe,  we  could  submit  some
written  questions,  if  Mr.  Lebacqz  would  be  kind  enough  to  answer
those for us.

Dr. LEBACQZ. Glad to do that, sir.
Mr. FORBES. Thank you.

PLANS FOR WIND TUNNEL CLOSURES

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  would  like  to  go  back  to  the  subject  we
were  talking  about,  and  let  me  preface  this  by  saying  that  I  am  a
restaurant operator, so I know zero about operating a wind tunnel,
so  you  are  going  to  have  to  help  me  with  this,  Dr.  Lebacqz,  and
the others on the panel. But it would seem to me that, as we talked
about  a  business  plan,  as  you  mentioned,  a  strategy,  a  national
strategy  on  aeronautics,  should  that—shouldn’t  we  arrive  at  that
first,  prior  to  making  a  determination  of  which  tunnel  should  stay
open  and  which  tunnel  should  close,  or  have  you  already  made  a
determination which tunnels should close?

Dr.  LEBACQZ.  We  certainly  have  not  made  a  determination  of
which  tunnels  should  close.  We  are,  as  I  mentioned,  trying  to  un-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:40 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 020007 PO 00000 Frm 00120 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA05\031605\20007 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

117

derstand  the  requirements  this  year,  but  you  are  also  exactly  cor-
rect, sir. That should be best done in the context of a national pol-
icy.

Chairman  CALVERT.  The—going  back  to  the—and  the  reason,  I
guess, that we spend some time on these tunnels is that, obviously,
a  significant  part  of  your  employee  load  is  to  operate  the  tunnels.
And  I  suspect  that  the—it  is  like  an  infrastructure  at  any  major
company, depending on your utilization rate, how many employees
do  you  have,  and  how  much  utilization  do  you  have  out  of  these
tunnels?

And that goes back, you know, to laypeople like myself, who look
at this and say, well, you know, you are not getting the great utili-
zation  of  this,  you  are  not  getting  the  productivity  out  of  your  em-
ployees,  but  on  the  other  hand,  you  may  have  science  of  national
importance that doesn’t meet a traditional business plan. So, I sus-
pect that that may be the case. But is there ways that we can oper-
ate these tunnels more effectively, with employees being able to be
shifted  from  one  location  to  another,  as  you  mentioned?  And  are
you  looking  into  that  type  of  thing,  where  you  can  maximize  the
number  of  tunnels  that  you  are  operating,  and  maximizing  the  ef-
fectiveness,  and  the,  you  know,  the  productivity  of  your  employee
base?

Dr.  LEBACQZ.  Yes,  sir.  I  think,  as  I  mentioned  earlier,  I  think
that  is  a  very  interesting  model,  that  it  is  an  analog  of  ways  that
other  organizations  operate  some  infrastructure.  That  is  a  reason,
again,  that  we  have  corporatized  the  management  of  the  tunnels,
so  that  we  can  look  at  this  from  an  agency  point  of  view,  rather
than a center-centric point of view.

U.S. COMPETITION

Chairman  CALVERT.  Maybe  some  of  the  others  can  answer  this
question for me. The tunnels that are competing with us, the Euro-
peans, in this case, how many tunnels do they have? Does anybody
know  the  answer  to  that  question?  I  mean,  how  many—what  are
we talking about here, as far as our——

Dr.  ANTO´ N.  Internationally,  I  don’t  have  a  number  off  the  top  of
my  head.  It  is  probably  in  the  50  to  100,  I  would  have  to  go  back
and count them.

Chairman CALVERT. Internationally, that is worldwide.

Chairman  CALVERT.  Now,  the  primary  competition  at  this—at
the  present  moment  is  coming  from  Europe,  I  assume.  And  these
tunnels are operated by the European Union?

Dr.  ANTO´ N.  They  are  operated  by  private  companies.  Some  of

them have some relationships with European governments.

Chairman CALVERT. Are they subsidized?
Dr. ANTO´ N. I don’t know the answer to the——

Dr.  HANSMAN.  I  think  that  Boeing  is  doing  some  tests  in
ONERA,  and  then  in  the—they  are  also  testing  the—I  think  there
is a Dutch, Netherlands——

and Boeing is doing their subsonic——

building  it,  all  private  money  that  is  operating  it?  All  private
money——
Dr.  ANTO´ N.  Only  the  operation,  it  used  to  belong  to  the  UK

the private operation that utilizes it?

Chairman  CALVERT.  Was  it  sold  at  a  less  than  market  price  to
Dr. ANTO´ N. I don’t know the details on that.
Chairman CALVERT. Dr. Klineberg, you seem to know the answer

to that question.

MOD.

Dr.  KLINEBERG.  I  do,  sir,  but  I  am  not  an  expert  in  that  arena.
But I—in the space business, I spent quite a bit in time in Europe,
in  consortia,  and  there  are  many,  many  ways  that  the  govern-
ments,  the  European  governments  support  their  aeronautics  and
space  industry,  and  you  have  touched  on  several  of  those,  and  I
think it is a good supposition that—support them.

Chairman CALVERT. I find it—if, in fact, it is the case, ironic that
an  American  company  would  be  in  Europe  using  a  competitor’s
technology  in  order  to  compete  with  the  same  people.  That  is
just——

Dr.  HANSMAN.  Well,  I  would  just  like  to  point  out  that  there
are—sometimes,  there  are  critical  tests  that  you  need  to  do  to  get
the  airplane  off  the  ground,  and  so,  you  may  be  using  that  facility
because it is the only one available in the world, and you are reduc-
ing your risk. I know——

Chairman CALVERT. Is that the case?
Dr. HANSMAN. That has happened in the past, yes.
Chairman  CALVERT.  Is  that  the  case  in  the  instance  that  we  are
using  for  comparison,  in  case  of  Boeing?  Is  that  why  they  are
there? Or are they there because of the cost?
Dr. ANTO´ N. In terms of the 5-meter, they were driven there when
the  Ames  facility  was  rebuilt,  and  there  was  no  alternative.  Right
now,  the  facility  there—they  like  the  technical  capabilities  better
there than the Ames 12-foot.

nel?

Chairman CALVERT. They like it better because it is a better tun-
Dr. ANTO´ N. They like the shape better, and some other technical

differences. It is——

Chairman  CALVERT.  Again—but  I  think  these  are  important—as
we  move  toward  a  strategy,  because  at  this  point,  we  don’t  have
one, apparently. And as we make a determination of how many em-
ployees we are going to have, or not have, it seems to me that these
are the kind of questions we are going to need to get more in depth
on, and some answers on, and I know we can’t do that in a hearing
context.  But  it  is  certainly  something  I  would  like  to  get  more  in-
volved in.

Representative Green, you are recognized for five minutes.

WORKFORCE RETENTION

Mr. GREEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, members

of the panel.

I have a special affinity and a kinship with NASA and for NASA,
I  suppose.  I  used  to  work  for  NASA.  I  had  the  very  good  fortune
of  working  for  NASA  as  a  co-op  student,  and  it  was  very  helpful
to  be  there,  and  to  work  with  some  of  the  scientists  and  engineers
as  they  were  performing  stellar  services  for  our  country,  and  in
fact, for the world. So, I salute you, and I thank you for coming in,
and giving us this very important information.

We  all  agree,  I  am  sure,  that  space  travel  is  inherently  haz-
ardous. A concern that I would want someone to address, and I am
not to sure to whom I should pose the question, but a concern that
I have has to do with the R&D and the exemplary technical stand-
ards  that  we  have  adhered  to.  Are  we  going  to  lose  something  in
the quality of our exemplary work by losing so many valuable and
talented minds?

Dr. LEBACQZ. Well, sir, I will have a shot at that. I think the an-
swer is no. NASA has, as a result of the Columbia tragedy two plus
years ago, instituted a couple of new entities to ensure, in fact, that
we  maintain  the  highest  standards  of  safety  and  engineering  dis-
cipline,  and  ensure  that  they  remain  within  NASA.  Excuse  me.
One  of  those  is  the  NASA  Engineering  and  Safety  Center,  which
is,  in  fact,  located  at,  in  NASA  Langley,  but  is  an  Agency-wide  ac-
tivity that provides independent, as-required, engineering and safe-
ty analyses of aspects of, specifically, right now, our return to flight
endeavors.

Additionally, we have, only within the last two months or so, ini-
tiated  under  our  new  Chief  Engineer,  Rex  Geveden,  something
called the Independent Technical Authority, which will be the best
people at our various centers, who are given, so to speak, warrants
to  go  and  check  independently  that  safety  and  engineering  stand-
ards  are,  in  fact,  at  the  highest  quality.  And  those  people  will  be
retained  and  maintained  throughout  any  activities  that  we  do,  as
long  as  we  are  going  to  be  flying  either  the  Shuttle  of  any  of  my
airplanes, for that matter.

So,  I  understand  the  concern.  When  people  leave,  you  always
worry  about  what  is  leaving,  but  in  those  particular—in  that  par-
ticular area, both of these entities are in place to do our best to en-
sure that doesn’t happen.

Mr. GREEN. I greatly appreciate the assurance, and I thank you,

Mr. Chairman, for the time.

Chairman  CALVERT.  If  you  would  like,  if  any  of  the  other  panel
like  Dr.

like  to  address  that 

issue  also.  It 

looked 

would 
Hansman——

Dr. HANSMAN. I would just say that I think that we can manage
through loss of some people. My concern is whether new people are
going to be coming in. So, in the future, will there be opportunities
for  co-ops,  like  you  had,  in  aeronautics.  Will  we  have  opportunity
path to bring our people in, to have them, potential for the future?
Because  my  concern  is  not  next  year  or  two  years,  my  concern  is
10 years.

Mr. GREEN. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentleman. The gentlelady from

Texas.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. First of all, let me welcome the new chairman
and  Ranking  Member  of  the  Committee,  and  we  are  in  the  middle
of marking up the bankruptcy bill in Judiciary, so I appreciate the
witnesses understanding that two important proceedings are going
on  at  once,  and  if  the  bells  ring,  that  means  they  are  saying  that
my amendments are before the Committee, and I am not there.

But  it  emphasizes  the  importance  of  this  hearing.  I  have  been  a
Member  of  this  committee  now  for  a  decade.  And  I  believe  my  ad-
vocacy  has  been  consistent  in  what  I  believe  is  a  key  element  of
the aeronautics industry, the aeronautics opportunity, which would
include,  of  course,  my  commitment  to  the  human  Space  Shuttle,
which is a little distinctive, but also, my view of the industry, com-
pared to how it is treated in Europe, which is that it is an industry
that  is  clearly  one  that  is  protected  and  provided  for.  I  am—want
to  share  some  thoughts  with  you,  and  then,  allow  you  to  comment
on this thrust that we are in.

In  the  course  of  supporting  NASA,  I  have  offered  several  com-
mentaries that don’t pertain directly to its operations, but it, hope-
fully,  contains—pertains  to  its  embrace.  One,  if  there  is  no  science
with aeronautics or human spaceflight, then what? I think the two
must  go  hand  in  hand,  and  that  means  that  the  International
Space  Station  should  be  a  place  of  scientific  research  and  study.
Whether it means that we create the next generation of machines,
the next generation of bioresearch, medical research, homeland se-
curity.  I  think  you  are  well  aware  of  the  reports,  although  late,
about  the  possibility  of  having  detected  the  tsunami  after  the  fact.
We  understood  there  might  have  been  that  capability.  How  tragic
and sad, if it was, and we were not aware.

I  remember  the  debates  of  saving  NASA  right  after  I  came  to
Congress.  The  preceding  term,  NASA’s  budget  passed  by  one  vote.
We  turned  the  corner  in  1995,  and  begin  to  show  that  NASA  and
its  spaceflight  meant  something  to  the  average  citizen,  that  there
was  HIV  research,  that  there  was  heart  disease,  there  was—or  re-
search  dealing  with  heart  disease  and  stroke  and  cancer.  In  fact,
we  had  a  partnership  with  the  Texas  Medical  Center.  We  are  not
going  to  continue  even  with  the  excitement  of  a  vision,  to  find
stakeholders, if we do not add R&D, or make sure that we are com-
bining  those  efforts.  That  is  my  first  point.  The  second  is  that  we
cannot have a good, strong program without safety.

I hope the Chairman of this committee will read some of the ma-
terials  that  I  will  be  providing  to  him.  I  know  that  he  has  heard
me comment on this, and I hope that we will have a hearing, either
in  the  Full  Committee,  or  in  this  subcommittee,  simply  on  the
question  of  safety.  Safety  cannot  be  judged  or  regulated  by  the  re-
cent newspaper articles, or the lack of oxygen, or lack of quality of
air, or lack of water, or lack of this or that at ISS. That is how we
get our information. There should be a Gehman’s Report similar to
what  happened  in  Columbia  VII.  In  addition,  as  Columbia  VII  be-
comes  a  backdrop  to  safety,  have  we  really  answered  all  of  those
questions,  and  have  we  truly  vetted  the  space  program  as  it  pro-
ceeds?

The  other  aspect  of  it  is  generally  looking  at  aeronautics  in  gen-
eral,  and  to  not  lose  the  competitive  edge  to  our  European  col-
leagues  on  this  question  of  producing  the  next  state  of  technology
in  aeronautics.  And  under  that  particular  concept,  I  would  just
simply  say  this.  This  industry  should  begin  to  look  in  diversity.
Historically black colleges, Hispanic-serving colleges, minority busi-
nesses, to embrace those entities, so that we can expand the stake-
holders,  those  who  are  understanding  the  industry,  and  those  who
can possibly move it into the 21st Century.

So I would welcome, in my short time that I have, I am not going
to  pose  questions.  I  will  review  your  testimony.  But  in  the  short
time  that  I  have,  I  would  be  interested  in,  Dr.  Hansman  and  oth-
ers, if you would just comment briefly on this—these concepts that
I have offered to you.

Dr. HANSMAN. Well—thanks. I agree 100 percent. We really need
to  maintain  the  core  research  and  development  capability.  That  is
going  to  be  the  heart  of  our  ability  to  respond  to  the  problems  in
the  future.  I  think  that  safety  is  clearly  a  key  issue,  and  in  fact,
you  can  point  to  contributions  NASA  has  made  to  safety  issues,
such  as  responding  to  wind  shear  and  other  aviation  weather  haz-
ards. I think we need to keep that going.

And  I  agree  with  you  100  percent  that  investing  in  our  people,
and  going  to  nontraditional  sources,  to  build  up  the  strength  in
places  like  the  historically  black  colleges,  in  the  aeronautics  is  a
real opportunity that we should take advantage of.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Doctor, if I may just get the NASA representa-
tives  to  comment  on  the  issue.  I  thank  you  for  indulging  me,  Mr.
Chairman.

Dr. LEBACQZ. Yes, ma’am. Let me start with the maintaining the
competitive  edge.  Competitive  edge  is  a  policy  issue.  If  we  have  a
national  policy  in  aeronautics  that  says  we  will,  as  a  country,  in-
vest in this arena as one of our niche areas, to maintain a competi-
tive edge, then we will be able to do that more clearly than we are
now.

I  agree  entirely  with  your  concern  about  where  the  ideas  come
from.  In  my  Mission  Directorate,  we  have  put  in  place  this  year
something called a Council of Deans, which has deans from 15 en-
gineering schools throughout the country, big ones, little ones, his-
torically  black  ones—Tuskegee  is  one—who  are  supposed  to  help
inform me of what our programs need to do to encourage education
in aeronautics in the universities, and vice versa, I will be inform-
ing  them  of  the  kinds  of  curricula  changes  they  should  have  to  re-
engage students in aeronautics. So, I think that is a critical thing,
a  fundamental  thing,  I  did  that  as  soon  as  I  became  the  Associate
Administrator a year and a half ago.

You  asked  about  Columbia,  and  whether  we  are,  in  fact,  fol-
lowing  through,  we  as  an  agency  are  following  through  on  the  Co-
lumbia Accident Investigation Board. As I know you have been told
and  heard  in  other  hearings,  we  believe,  and  are  working  assidu-
ously to ensure that we meet every single recommendation and re-
quirement  from  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board,  and
we will not fly the Shuttle again until we do.

There  are  a  whole  host  of  discussions  one  can  get  into  relative
to  that,  but  the  fact  is  we  are  not  flying  that  machine  until  we  all

believe  that  it  is  safe.  We  have  gone  through  a  culture  change  ac-
tivity. I think that may have been breached at a previous hearing,
to  ensure  that  people  who  think  there  is  an  issue  with  safety  are
able to raise it without fear of reprisal. And I believe that that, and
that  activity  has,  in  fact,  been  quite  successful.  God  knows  I  am
getting  more  emails  than  I  used  to  get.  So,  I  think  the  answer  to
that  question  is  pretty  clear.  As  John  mentioned,  in  my  programs,
in  the  aeronautics  research  programs,  our  work  in  aviation  safety
has led to assessing wind shear. It has led to these synthetic vision
systems,  that  will  allow  us  to  fly  in  bad  weather,  and  be  able  to
see better. It has led to putting turbulence detectors on commercial
aircraft,  so  that  we  can  sense  ahead  whether  the  airplane  is  going
to be upset, and somebody will be hurt. That is a fundamental part
of what we are doing.

Chairman CALVERT. I thank the gentlelady. Appreciate it.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you very much.
Chairman  CALVERT.  Let  us  see.  I  think  I  am  next.  Or  is  it  the
gentleman from—Mr. Udall, yeah, I think he did the second round,
and——

Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I asked, my initial round,
Dr. Lebacqz, his impressions, and I want to turn to the four of you,
I  think  start  with  Dr.  Hansman,  I  will  restate  the  question.  We
will  come  across,  and—if  I  get  done  quickly,  you  each  should  have
about a minute, within a five-minute context.

EFFECTS OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL

I  had  asked  what  would  the  consequences  be  for  the  future  of
NASA’s  aeronautics  program  if  the  funding  and  workforce  and  in-
frastructure  reductions  contained  in  this  five-year  budget  plan  ac-
tually come to pass?

Dr.  HANSMAN.  I  think  it  is  clear,  because  of  the  cutbacks,  that
the  national  capability  represented  by  NASA  will  be  reduced,  and
I  think  that—I  personally  have  concerns  as  to  whether  we  will  be
able  to  meet  challenges  that  are  going  to  emerge  in  the  future,
some of which we can’t predict right now.

Mr. UDALL. Dr. Benzakein.
Dr.  BENZAKEIN.  I  would  agree  with  that  statement.  I  do  think,
in addition to that, I am not sure this is a second question, but the
competency  is  going  down  in  Vehicle  Systems.  You  did  mention  a
serious reduction in Vehicle Systems. This is exactly where Europe
is  going  to  give  us  a  very,  very  strong  competition.  But  I  do  think
this  reduction  really  drives  to  the  heart  of  the  problem  we  have.
In  addition  to  that,  Europe,  in  addition  to  putting  more  money  on
these  programs,  really  has  put  together  a  consortium  of  university
and  academia,  to  really  address  that.  And  the  universities  is  lead-
ing  this  effort  in  defining  those  programs.  And  that,  really,  has
driven  the  right  balance  between  short  and  long  range,  which  I
don’t see happening in this country.

Mr.  UDALL.  You  would  say  that,  I  was  reading  the  comments  of
the  EC,  the  European  Commission’s  multiyear  initiative,  and  they
not  only  have  put  words  on  paper,  but  they  are  putting  resources
behind their efforts.

Dr. BENZAKEIN. Absolutely.
Mr. UDALL. Dr. Anto´n.

123

Dr. ANTO´ N. I would just like to add that the management and—
efforts that NASA is pursuing, I think make a lot of sense, and go
a long way to helping out. The only question I guess I would raise
with—relative  to  workforce  and  infrastructure  is  to  emphasize  the
fact  that  capabilities  for  test  facilities  isn’t  just  a  hardware  issue.
It is also the workforce issue, and so, there—if we do lose workforce
capabilities,  that—there  is  a  degradation  in  that  capability.  You
can’t just simply just mothball and preserve it in that level.

So, the question ultimately comes down to how long a range does
NASA, is NASA resourced so that they can look out, and try to pre-
serve  things  that  maybe  not—may  not  necessarily  fit  and  support
current  research  programs,  but  would  allow  them  options  later  on
to add new programs, as opportunities arise.

Mr. UDALL. Dr. Klineberg.
Dr.  KLINEBERG.  Yeah.  Thank  you.  I  am  concerned,  also,  about
this—the  consequences  of  the  infrastructure,  but  I  believe  NASA
aeronautics  is  doing  what  they  can  within  the  budget.  If  you  will,
I  would  just  like  to  quickly  remember  an  anecdote  from  my  career
in NASA.

Some  time  in  the  mid-80s,  there  was  a  very  clever  guy  down  at
Langley,  Richard  Whitcomb,  who  was  working  in  the  7  by  10  tun-
nel, I believe, which he was responsible for, and he was filing away
the  wings,  and  trying  different  concepts,  and  he  came  up  with  the
idea that if, instead of having a wing be one plane, if you put aero-
dynamic devices at the wingtip, he called them winglets, you could
improve  the  lift  of  the  commercial  airplanes.  The  industry  was
pretty  negative  about  that,  gosh,  we  can’t  do  that,  and  we  have
problems, you know, there were a lot of reasons not to do that, and
you now go to any commercial airplane in the world, and they have
winglets.  They  have  these  things  on  the  tips  that  vastly  improve
the  efficiency  of  the  transportation  system,  reduce  the  amount  of
fuel import, all sorts of public goods, come from that invention that
was  made  in  a  tunnel,  that  was  used  only  for  in-house  work,  was
not  used  in  the  way  we  are  talking  here,  to  support  industry  or
specific  programs,  and  resulted  in  a  breakthrough  that  was  very
important.

And there are many other like that. The problem you are asking
us  now,  and  I  think  Mr.  Anto´n  and  John  Hansman  said  it,  is  you
try  to  project  from  the  future,  make  decisions  now  to  project  from
the future, is very difficult. Thank you for your indulgence.

AERONAUTICS FUNDING CUTS

Mr.  UDALL.  I  see  my  time  is  beginning  to  expire,  and  I  didn’t
want  to  leave  Dr.  Lebacqz  alone  in  this  next  round.  I  am  going  to
make  a  comment,  and  we  will  see  if  there  is  a  chance  for  you  to
respond.

As  I  understand,  part  of  the  budgetary  problem  is  that  aero-
nautics  had  a  sort  of  almost  a  third  of  the  cut  that  the  White
House  made  to  NASA’s  budget  plans  from—for  fiscal  year  2006
through  2009,  and  it  is  a  puzzling  allocation,  because  aeronautics,
as  I  do  the  numbers,  only  represents  about  one-seventeenth  of  the
NASA budget. Would you care to comment on why aeronautics took
such a large share of the overall cut?

tion.

Dr. LEBACQZ. The change in the budget from the fiscal ’05 runout
to the fiscal ’06 request is a difference of a projected increase of 5.8
percent from ’05 to ’06 in the ’05 runout, and an actual 2.4 percent.
The  Agency  believed  that  we  should  try  to  contribute,  also,  to  the
reduction  in  the  deficit  of  the  country,  and  so,  what  we  asked  for
was  actually  less  than  in  our  previous  runout.  Within  that,  three
Mission Directorates actually received less money than they had in
the  runout  of  the  ’05  budget,  of  which  I  am  one.  In  our  case,  our
runout  was  flat,  so  receiving  less  means  that  we  ended  up  getting
less. In the case of the other two, receiving less was just less than
the request would have been, but was still an increase.

That  is  about  as  far  as  I  want  to  go  with  answering  that  ques-

Mr. UDALL. Yeah. I——
Dr. LEBACQZ. In fact, what I just told you——
Mr.  UDALL.  I  appreciate,  in  conclusion,  the  hard  work  you  do,
and  I  still  would  stick  by  my  statement  that  you  have  a  thankless
task to come up here to the Hill and justify what I think are worri-
some cuts in a—the sort of endeavors that I think are equal in im-
portance  to  the  space  exploration  programs  that  we  all  support,
and we have heard, I think, very eloquently, why. It is national se-
curity.  It  is  economic  opportunity.  It  is  maintaining  our  workforce,
exciting  young  people  to  stay  in  engineering  and  math  and  tech-
nology  fields,  and  for  all  those  reasons,  I  just  want  to  again  say  I
am  very  concerned  about  the  direction  in  which  we  are  heading.  I
thank the panel.

Dr.  LEBACQZ.  Thank  you,  sir,  and  again,  that  is  why  I  am  open,
we in the Agency are open to a policy dialogue, across the country.
There  are  certainly  a  number  of  areas  in  which  breakthroughs  in
aeronautics  are  still  waiting  to  be  found,  including  hypersonics,
which  was  one  of  your  original  parts  of  your  question  that  I  never
got to, including rapid demonstrations of transforming the national
airspace system through far more airborne autonomy, and a variety
of other things. So, that is why we need this policy dialogue.

Chairman  CALVERT.  I  thank  the  gentleman.  Just  a  couple  of
quick  questions  before  we  wrap  this  up.  Dr.  Klineberg,  in  your
study,  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  what  did  they  have  in
mind  when  they  said 
‘‘disposing  of  underutilized  facilities?’’
Mothballing,  shutting  down  completely,  or  what  do  you  mean  by
that?

Dr.  KLINEBERG.  We  were  just  recognizing  budget  realities,  and
realized those are a very—they are really expensive, some facilities.
And where there were facilities which were truly duplicative, either
of  air  force  capability,  or  within  NASA,  we  thought,  obviously,
those  needed  to  be  shut  down.  But  we  didn’t  look  in  detail.  We
urged NASA to do a study, and I know the RAND Corporation, and
my colleague here, Dr. Anto´n, in fact, did that study, to take a look
at those facilities.

HYPERSONICS

Chairman CALVERT. Dr. Lebacqz, you mentioned hypersonics just
a second ago, and had I ever had him on the Armed Services Com-
mittee, and obviously, this has some—obviously some defense capa-
bility,  potentially.  How  is  DOD  reacting  to  this,  these  potential

cuts?  Have  you  heard  from  their  compadres  over  there?  What  do
they have to say about that?

Dr.  LEBACQZ.  I  have  a  meeting  this  Friday,  sir,  with  Dr.  Sega,
DDR&E,  on  this  subject.  As  you  may  have  read  in  the  Post  this
morning, the—DARPA is moving forward with the Falcon program,
which  is  taking  some  of  the  things  that  we  learned  from  the  X-43,
and  trying  to  take  them  to  the  next  step.  But  we  will  be  having
discussions with Dr. Sega on this subject.

Chairman  CALVERT.  And  how  would  you  describe  your  coordina-

tion with the Department of Defense, as of late?

Dr. LEBACQZ. It is not as good as I would like it to be.
Chairman CALVERT. Is NASA still involved, to any significant de-
gree,  in  some  of  the  black  operations  that  the  Department  of  De-
fense is involved in?

Dr. LEBACQZ. I probably can’t answer that.
Chairman  CALVERT.  I  mean,  we  are  not  asking  you  to  describe

the program, just whether or not—is there——

Dr. LEBACQZ. Yes. We have. Yes.
Chairman  CALVERT.—still—okay.  Okay.  Dr.  Griffin,  I  know,  our
new  Administrator,  is  coming  on,  has  very  much  been  involved  in
all of this, and we are certainly looking forward to his involvement
in  this.  Wrapping  this  up,  I  am  looking  forward  to  us  working  to-
ward  a  vision  on  aeronautics,  as  we  move  toward  these  budget
cuts.  If  that  is  what  we  are  going  to  do.  And  before,  I  think  you
are  right,  we  have  got  to  get  the—we  can’t  have  the  tail  wagging
the  dog  here.  We  are  going  to  have  to  work  out  something  that
makes more sense, I think.

I  certainly  appreciate  this  panel.  I  certainly  appreciate  your
spending the time with us today. And with that, we are adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 1:00 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  J.  Victor  Lebacqz,  Associate  Administrator,  Aeronautics  Research  Mis-

sion Directorate, NASA

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. On  May  3,  2005,  you  provided  the  Committee  with  a  White  Paper  on  the  Aero-
nautics Test Program that outlines your plans for NASA wind tunnels in Fiscal
Year  (FY)  06  and  beyond.  What  steps  need  to  be  taken  for  this  plan  to  be  for-
mally approved and put into effect? When do you expect that process to be com-
pleted?

A1. As  part  of  our  FY  2007  budget  formulation  process,  NASA  is  considering  initi-
ation of the Aeronautics Test Program. The deliberations within the Administration
will culminate in the FY 2007 budget submission to Congress in February 2006.
Q2. The  White  Paper  describes  NASA  as  ‘‘in  general,  concur[ring]’’  with  the  rec-
ommendations of the RAND study of wind tunnels. Yet clearly, the White Paper
plan  prioritizes  wind  tunnels  quite  differently  than  RAND  did,  as  the  White
Paper apparently considers the rate of use of a tunnel as the primary classifica-
tion  criteria.  Why  did  you  decide  to  reject  RAND’s  notion  that  NASA  needed  to
take into consideration the uniqueness of facilities and potential future national
needs?

A2. The Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) has, or is attempting to
respond to the RAND study’s eight conclusions and six recommendations, including
the development of an aeronautics test facility plan, providing institutional (shared)
funding  to  alleviate  the  full-cost  recovery  burden  from  individual  customers,  main-
taining  and  investing  in  a  minimum  set  of  test  facilities,  etc.  We  diverge  from  the
RAND  study  with  regards  to  our  current  selection  of  the  ‘‘minimum  set’’  of  ground
test facilities that we believe to be important to sustain for the future of NASA and
the Nation’s aeronautics needs. RAND assessed 31 ground test facilities. NASA cur-
rently considers six of the 31 to be critical to sustain in full operational status. Ten
of  the  31  are  to  be  kept  in  standby  and  used  as  needed,  two  are  to  be  mothballed
because  while  we  agree  with  RAND  regarding  their  criticality,  there  is  simply  no
present or projected future work, four are to be closed, and the other nine facilities
that RAND assessed are to be maintained by the field centers, without direct finan-
cial  support  from  the  ARMD.  These  nine  are  mainly  small,  lab-type,  hypersonics
and  engine  test 
in  hypersonics  and
turbomachinery research by NASA, the Centers are most likely to not use these fa-
cilities.  At  the  same  time,  we  do  not  anticipate  that  anything  irreversible  will  be
done  to  these  facilities  which  would  preclude  the  Agency  from  operating  them  fu-
ture.

facilities.  During  the  current  hiatus 

We  assessed  and  then  categorized  the  facilities  based  on  utilization,  facility
uniqueness  and  future  national  need.  Assessing  both  utilization  and  national  need
allowed  us  to  consider  the  needs  of  NASA  Aeronautics,  other  NASA  mission  direc-
torates,  DOD,  other  government  agencies  and  the  U.S.  industry.  Keeping  the  Na-
tional  Transonic  Facility  in  an  operational  status  is  an  explicit  acknowledgement
that the Nation’s only flight Reynolds Number wind tunnel, while not currently uti-
lized  by  NASA  Research  Programs,  is  of  critical  national  importance.  Similarly,
many  of  the  facilities  that  we  will  put  into  standby  have  unique  performance  char-
acteristics  which  make  them  indispensable  from  a  national  perspective.  So  while
NASA  does  not  currently  need  these  facilities  to  meet  Aeronautics  Research  pro-
gram requirements, we are committing NASA Aeronautics funding to sustain these
facilities,  for  the  very  reasons  that  RAND  recommended.  Lastly,  it  should  be  noted
that  RAND  defined  nine  NASA  test  facilities  that  they  deem  to  be  ‘‘detrimental  to
close.’’  All  of  these  nine  facilities  are  being  maintained  by  NASA  in  either  oper-
ational, stand-by, or mothball conditions.
Q3. The  White  Paper  states  that  NASA  will  be  running  a  University  Research
Project funded ‘‘at one percent of the ‘after tax’.’’ Please describe what this means
and  what  level  of  funding  is  anticipated  for  the  University  Research  Project  in
FY06.  Would  you  expect  the  University  Research  Project  and  the  $1  million  in
university  funds  in  the  Aeronautics  Test  Program  to  be  all  the  money  available
for universities from the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD)?

A3. The  tax  referred  to  are  the  Agency  Corporate  General  and  Administrative
(G&A)  costs  and  the  Mission  Directorate  budget  required  to  fund  Mission  Direc-
torate  operations.  Approximately  10  percent  of  the  FY  2004  aeronautics  budget

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:40 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 020007 PO 00000 Frm 00132 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\031605\20007 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

129

($106M  of  the  $1,056M  aeronautics  budget)  went  to  universities.  The  estimate  for
FY  2005  is  also  projected  to  be  about  10  percent.  For  FY  2006,  NASA  anticipates
that  approximately  10  percent  of  $852M  (or  about  $85M)  will  be  with  universities.
The  University  Research  Project  that  NASA  is  considering  would  enable  NASA  to
seek  from  the  university  community  revolutionary  ideas  for  aeronautics  research
that  would  not  otherwise  be  possible  if  the  research  were  tied  directly  to  the  indi-
vidual programs. If implemented, this project would be part of the $85M.
Q4. How  did  NASA  determine  how  many  employees  it  would  cut  from  the  ARMD
in  FY06?  Were  these  cuts  made  pursuant  to  any  strategy  or  were  they  just  a
budgetary calculation? How will NASA determine which employees to cut?

A4. Future  ARMD  workforce  requirements  at  the  NASA  Centers  were  derived  as
an integral part of the overall strategy for realigning the Aeronautics Research pro-
gram.  As  in  any  fiscal  year,  the  process  of  projecting  future  aeronautics-related
workforce  levels  (and  facility  needs)  at  the  Centers  began  with  the  programmatic
requirements  established  by  the  Agency  through  the  annual  programming  and
budget development process, culminating with the preparation of the FY 2006 Presi-
dent’s budget as submitted to Congress. The FY 2006 NASA budget reflects a major
transformation in both the content and conduct of the Aeronautics Research Mission
Directorate’s  programs.  With  respect  to  content,  the  ARMD  program,  in  particular
the Vehicle Systems Program, has been transformed to focus on four ‘‘barrier-break-
ing’’ technology demonstrations, emphasizing higher-risk research where the private
sector  will  not  optimally  invest  due  to  risk  and  anticipated  rate  of  return  (as  op-
posed  to  more  near-term  development  programs  that  are  typically  the  purview  of
the  private  sector).  With  respect  to  conduct,  ARMD  will  be  placing  a  renewed  em-
phasis  on  realizing  best  value  for  the  taxpayer’s  investment  through  a  combination
of  competition  models.  One  aspect  of  the  increased  use  of  competition  is  expected
to  be  a  greater  contribution  by  the  private  sector  to  the  conduct  of  NASA’s  aero-
nautics research.

Both  of  the  changes  in  strategic  direction  (i.e.,  content  and  conduct)  have  the  po-
tential  for  a  substantial  impact  on  the  NASA  workforce.  Having  established  the
transformed  programmatic  requirements,  ARMD—working  with  the  Centers  and
the  Agency’s  human  capital  planning  community—quantified  the  impact  on  work-
force  requirements  of  the  combination  of  a  more  focused  research  effort  and  an  in-
creased  private  sector  role.  This  impact  was  defined  both  in  terms  of  numbers  of
employees  and  in  terms  of  specific  skill  mixes  required  to  implement  anticipated
programs.  Workforce  numbers  and  skills  that  did  not  fall  within  the  revised  set  of
Aeronautics-related program requirements then became the basis for future human
capital actions including buyouts and reassignments.
Q5. The proposed budget for FY06 reflects a decision to move away from incremental
subsonic  research.  Has  NASA  assessed  the  impact  that  would  have  on  the  U.S.
aircraft  manufacturing  industry?  What  is  the  evidence  that  this  work  would  be
funded or carried out elsewhere?

A5. To  ensure  maximum  benefit  to  the  taxpayer,  we  are  transforming  part  of  our
investment  in  Aeronautics  Research  investment  in  order  to  more  sharply  focus  the
investment on revolutionary, high-risk, ‘‘barrier breaking’’ technologies. Toward this
end,  the  NASA  Aeronautics  Vehicle  Systems  Program  (VSP)  has  been  refocused
away from evolutionary research and technology development and toward more key
revolutionary,  ‘‘barrier-breaking’’  technology  demonstration  projects  that  address
critical public needs related to reduction of aircraft noise and emissions, and enable
new science missions. NASA’s assessment is that the revolutionary technologies de-
veloped within the next decade will form the basis for a new generation of environ-
mentally friendly aircraft and will enhance U.S. competitiveness 20 years from now.
The work that was terminated to refocus the program is carried out elsewhere. One
example  is  the  recent  General  Electric  Aircraft  Engines  announcement  regarding
the  capability  of  their  GEnx  aircraft  engine.  The  following  is  extracted  from  GEAE
brochures:

‘‘The  GEnx  engine  will  achieve  dramatic  gains  in  fuel  efficiency  and  perform-
ance with significantly lower emissions than other engines in its class. And the
GEnx is the quietest large commercial engine we have ever produced.
‘‘And  by  incorporating  our  most  advanced  combustion  technology  ever,  the  re-
sult will be an engine that will produce fewer smog-causing emissions than the
maximum  allowed  by  2008  international  standards  (94  percent  fewer  hydro-
carbon  emissions  and  57  percent  nitrogen  emissions),  while  consuming  at  least
15 percent less fuel than the engines they replace.

‘‘With  the  use  of  our  unique,  super  high  bypass  composite  fan  design,  these
same  aircraft  are  expected  to  be  30  percent  quieter  than  today’s  GE-powered
aircraft.’’

Q6. You  have  stated  that  hypersonics  would  be  one  of  your  top  priorities  if  money
were  restored  to  the  ARMD  budget.  Why  is  that  a  top  priority?  Are  hypersonic
aircraft  likely  to  be  used  for  commercial  as  well  as  military  purposes?  What  is
the basis for your answer?

A6. A  hypersonic  technology  demonstration  is  one  of  several  candidates  that  would
be  considered  following  completion  of  the  current  set  of  demonstrations  identified
in  the  FY  2006  President’s  Budget  Request  for  aeronautics  research.  Examined  for
many years, hypersonic vehicles provide the potential for low-cost, reliable access to
low-Earth  orbit.  NASA’s  interest  is  for  long-term  civilian  purposes,  however,  the
military  may  find  applicability  for  this  type  of  vehicle.  NASA’s  recent  success  with
the Hyper-X, in which a scramjet was flight demonstrated at Mach 7 and 10, is the
culmination of this work. However, many breakthroughs are required before routine
hypersonic access to space is realized. Low-cost reliability means that these vehicles
would  accomplish  many  take-offs  and  landings;  NASA’s  success  to  date  is  limited
to two 10-second flights. Much research and technology work remains to develop en-
gines  and  airframes,  particularly  in  high-temperature  materials  and  propulsion.
Due to these challenges, a hypersonic demonstrator is of potential interest.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. Administrator  Gregory’s  recent  testimony  to  the  Science  Committee  indicated
that NASA has established ‘‘core competencies’’ at each of the NASA Centers that
‘‘must be maintained in order for the Agency’s mission to be achieved.’’ I under-
stand  that  NASA  headquarters  has  had  each  of  the  Centers  do  an  assessment
of the ‘‘health’’ of their core competencies, that is, an assessment of whether any
core competencies are at risk of being lost or degraded.

Q1a. What have the aeronautical research Centers—Glenn, Langley, Ames, and Dry-

den—reported regarding the health of their core competencies?

Q1b. Have  any  of  those  Centers  reported  that  their  core  competencies  are  at  risk?  If

so, where, and what competencies have they identified as being at risk?

Q1c. What  will  NASA  Headquarters  do  in  response  to  those  assessments?  Is  NASA

prepared to request additional funding to deal with the problem?

A1a,b,c. Of  the  thirteen  approved  NASA  core  competencies  located  at  the  four  Re-
search  Centers  (ARC,  DFRC,  GRC  and  LARC),  six  are  associated  with  the  Aero-
nautics  Research  Mission  Directorate.  These  are  Air  Transportation  Management
Systems  (ARC),  Atmospheric  Flight  Research  and  Test  (DFRC),  Aeropropulsion
(GRC)  and  Aerosciences,  Aerospace  Materials  and  Structures,  and  Systems  Anal-
ysis/Engineering and Safety (LARC). It should be noted that the three Langley core
competencies also provide substantial support to all of the other NASA Mission Di-
rectorates.

Following the identification and assignment of these core competencies, each Cen-
ter  completed  an  initial  assessment  of  the  health  of  each  competency.  This  assess-
ment consisted of an initial estimation of the minimal investment (in people and fa-
cilities)  required  to  sustain  the  competency,  coupled  with  programmatic  guidance
from the four Mission Directorates regarding anticipated requirements for each com-
petency.  Based  on  this  initial  assessment,  the  Centers  reported  that  all  but  one  of
the six aeronautics-related competencies faced potential challenges beginning in FY
2005 (the exception being the Systems Analysis/Engineering and Safety Competency
at  LARC).  In  FY  2005,  the  primary  factor  behind  a  less  than  fully  healthy  assess-
ment  was  the  accommodation  of  Congressional  interest  items  (necessitating  reduc-
tions  at  the  Centers  to  create  funds  for  out-of-house  contract  awards);  in  FY  2006
and out the primary factors were changes in Mission Directorate requirements.

There  are  still  three  important  steps  remaining  in  the  first  round  of  the  NASA
Core Competency activity. First, each of the Mission Directorates (including ARMD)
is engaged in a dialogue with each Center that has a related performing competency
regarding  the  sizing  of  the  minimal  sustainment  level.  Second,  each  of  the  Mission
Directorates  continues,  as  part  of  the  FY  2007  budget  development  process,  to  up-
date  and  clarify  its  anticipated  programmatic  requirements.  Once  these  first  two
steps  are  completed,  the  Agency  will  be  able  to  complete  a  final  assessment  of  the
projected  health  of  each  competency.  As  the  third  step,  strategies  for  dealing  with
any  identified  shortfalls  in  the  suite  of  NASA  core  competencies,  for  example  addi-

tional  Mission  Directorate  or  Agency 
dispositioned.
Q2. The  NASA  FY  2006  budget  book  discussion  of  NASA’s  Aviation  Safety  and  Se-
curity  program  states  that  ‘‘Given  the  loss  of  critical  workforce/skills/facilities,
there is the possibility that cost and schedule may be impacted.’’

investment,  will  be  developed  and

Q2a. What is the reason for the loss of those critical workforce/skills/facilities?
Q2b. Are they considered ‘‘excess competencies’’ by NASA? If so, why?
A2a,b. The section that is quoted is identifying the risks that the program may en-
counter  throughout  its  life  cycle.  As  part  of  a  risk  management  plan,  the  program
develops  a  mitigation  strategy  for  each  of  these  potential  events  even  though  they
are not currently an issue that needs to be actively worked.

Loss  of  critical  capabilities  can  occur  for  a  myriad  of  reasons  including  personnel
turnover and skill mix, which is a normal process for any long term program, (e.g.,
retirement,  illness,  new  job  opportunities,  etc.)  whereas  facility  issues  are  normally
unique, such as breakdowns, multiple users vying for the same time, etc.

While the in-house skills and facilities are not excess, it may be possible to accom-

plish the mission in an alternative manner if one is lost or not available.

As  an  example,  the  LARC  757  research  aircraft  is  a  one  of  a  kind  facility  that
is  used  to  flight  test  aeronautical  technologies.  When  this  aircraft  encountered  an
extended safety stand down, the Aviation Safety Program worked with airlines, air-
craft  manufacturers,  etc.  to  install  and  test  NASA  technologies  on  their  vehicles.
This resulted in NASA technologies being flight tested without noticeable impact to
the original schedule even though a critical capability was not available. As a bonus,
these  technologies  were  tested  in  an  actual  operational  environment,  which  en-
hanced the technology transfer process.

Similarly while personnel turnover is a normal activity, outside forces may result
in a significant local loss of personnel that will have to be mitigated by use of other
NASA,  academia,  or  industry  assets.  This  may  result  in  financial  and  cost  impacts
for the program.
Q3. Your  budget  shows  a  five-year  funding  plan  for  Vehicle  Systems  with  a  focus
on  four  breakthrough  technology  flight  demonstration  projects.  Please  provide
the  funding  profile  for  each  of  the  four  Vehicle  Systems  demonstration  projects
over the five-year period, as well as over the life of each project that extends be-
yond the five-year period covered in the FY06 request. Please provide the specific
milestones  for  each  project,  as  well  as  the  specific  accomplishments  anticipated
at the end of the five-year period and at the completion of each project.

A3. The  Vehicle  Systems  program  will  demonstrate  revolutionary  technology  con-
cepts through flight demonstrators that are beyond the scope of conventional air ve-
hicles. Preliminary plans are to focus on the four specific projects that are described.
Over  the  next  year,  the  program  will  work  with  the  aeronautics  community  to  de-
fine  the  scope  of  the  overall  program.  To  initiate  this  discussion,  preliminary  mile-
stones have been developed for planning purposes. These preliminary estimates are
detailed below for each of the four projects.

Estimated budget:

Subsonic Noise Reduction: Continues  the  barrier  breaking  research  for  reducing
airport  noise.  A  demonstration  of  noise  reduction  technologies  for  large  transport
aircraft  will  establish  a  significant  milestone  toward  keeping  objectionable  noise
within airport boundaries. The demonstration will include advanced engine and air-
frame  noise  reduction  approaches  as  well  as  innovative  continuous  descent  ap-

proaches  to  avoid  the  objectionable  changes  in  engine  speed  as  an  aircraft  ap-
proaches the airport.

Subsonic  Noise  Reduction  will  by  the  end  of  FY  2008  identify  those  technologies
that will contribute to a validated 10dB reduction, and by the end of FY 2009, iden-
tify those technologies that will extend that validated noise reduction to 15dB.
Sonic Boom Reduction: If nothing is done to break the barrier of supersonic flight
overland,  it  will  take  just  as  long  to  fly  across  the  country  in  the  third  century  of
flight  as  it  did  halfway  through  the  first  century.  The  barrier  to  high-speed  flight
is defining a sonic boom level that is acceptable to the general public, and designing
an  aircraft  top  reach  that  level.  On  recent  successful  flight  validation  of  the  theory
that by altering the contours of a supersonic aircraft, the shockwave and its accom-
panying sonic boom can be shaped resulting in a greatly reduced sonic boom signa-
ture  on  the  ground.  Work  will  investigate  the  formation  of  shaped  waves  and  the
human  response  to  shaped  waves  to  allow  developing  an  acceptable  regulatory
standard.  The  Sonic  Boom  Reduction  will  culminate  with  a  flight  demonstration  of
a low boom vehicle by the end of FY 2010.
HALE:  NASA  opened  the  doors  to  high  altitude  flight  when  it  successfully  dem-
onstrated  the  Helios.  NASA  will  extend  this  accomplishment  through  a  series  of
high  altitude  long  endurance  aircraft  that  will  extend  duration,  range  and  payload
capacity. The first breakthrough will be a 14-day duration aircraft that flies at over
50  thousand  feet  prior  to  the  end  of  FY  2008,  followed  by  a  flight  demonstration
that  will  achieve  a  30-day  endurance  flight  demonstration  by  the  end  of  FY  2010.
Zero  Emissions  Aircraft:  Conventional  turbo  machinery  powered  by  fossil  fuels
can only incrementally address the need to reduce harmful NOΧ and CO2 emissions
from  aircraft.  A  breakthrough  demonstration  of  an  all-electric  aircraft  propulsion
system will be the first step towards an emissionless aircraft. NASA intends to con-
duct zero emissions flight demonstrations mid-FY 2010.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. Why  did  NASA  decide  to  discontinue  rotorcraft  research,  despite  the  National
Research Council’s recommendation that ‘‘NASA should conduct research in se-
lected areas related to rotorcraft’’?

A1. NASA  has  transformed  the  Vehicle  Systems  Program  to  focus  on  key  barrier-
breaking  demonstrations.  While  none  of  the  initial  set  is  a  rotorcraft  follow-on,  the
mission  directorate  continues  to  monitor  advances  in  rotorcraft  technology  and
maintains communication with the industry (through the American Helicopter Soci-
ety) and the Army in the event that similar barrier-breaking opportunities arise.

More  specifically,  the  Aviation  Safety  &  Security  Program  continues  to  examine
ways to extend fixed-wing aircraft technology development, such as synthetic vision
and  weather  information  systems,  to  rotorcraft.  This  was  the  specific  recommenda-
tion of the NRC.
Q2. Please provide the five-year NASA funding profile required to meet the objectives
of  the  JPDO  Integrated  Plan.  How  does  that  compare  to  the  five-year  funding
plan for NASA’s Airspace Systems program?

A2. The  JPDO  is  still  in  the  process  of  developing  the  integrated  roadmap  for  the
Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System  (NGATS).  The  integrated  roadmap
should  be  completed  by  the  end  of  the  calendar  year.  Until  such  time,  the  specific
funding profile required to meet the NGATS plan is unknown. Once the funding re-
quirements  are  known,  NASA  will  review  its  Airspace  Systems  Program  to  ensure
appropriate alignment.
Q3. In 2001 NASA and DOD entered into a joint National Aerospace Initiative (NAI)
that identified hypersonic research as an important focus for both near-term and
long-term efforts. Furthermore, your testimony at the March 16th hearing show-
cased NASA’s initial accomplishments in this area of research. Given that, why
didn’t  NASA  request  any  funding  for  hypersonic  research  in  FY  2006?  Was  the
reason budgetary?

A3. The  NASA  investment  in  hypersonic  research  culminated  in  successful  flight
demonstrations  at  nearly  Mach  7  and  Mach  10  in  FY  2004.  In  FY  2005,  NASA,
under an item of special Congressional interest, is focusing on analyzing and trans-
ferring  technical  information  to  assist  the  Air  Force  with  their  X–43C  activities.  In
FY  2006,  NASA  has  no  requirement  for  a  hypersonic  vehicle  to  meet  its  launch  re-
quirements for the new Exploration Vision and therefore, the Agency terminated its
Next Generation Launch Technology program. With other aeronautics programmatic

priorities  in  FY  2006,  it  was  not  possible  to  propose  additional  hypersonic  research
in the President’s Budget Request. However, we will continue to assess the Nation’s
hypersonic requirements and options for the future.
Q4. NASA  apparently  is  considering  closing  down  additional  ‘‘underutilized’’  facili-
ties in part to free up funds for the exploration initiative. Aeronautical test facili-
ties and the technicians that operate them have been identified as likely targets.
However, a recent RAND Corporation assessment prepared for NASA concluded
that: ‘‘NASA should maintain nearly all of its 31 major wind tunnel and propul-
sion  test 
facilities  to  support  research,  development,  production,  and
sustainment by the Nation’s aeronautic industry.’’

Q4a. Have you reviewed the RAND assessment?
Q4b. Do you agree with it?
Q4c. What is NASA planning to do about the 31 test facilities and associated work-

force cited in the RAND assessment?

A4a,b,c. The RAND project team briefed NASA management at multiple points dur-
ing  the  conduct  of  the  RAND  study,  including  a  final  briefing  summarizing  their
findings.

We believe that the RAND team did a commendable job of not only assessing the
current state of, and environment surrounding, NASA’s major aerodynamic and pro-
pulsion ground test facilities, but also of developing and using an assessment meth-
od  that  can  be  applied  as  national  and  programmatic  requirements  continue  to
evolve.  In  general,  we  concur  with  the  RAND  team  on  the  basic  substance  of  all  of
their findings and recommendations. In particular, we agree with their findings that
ground test facilities (along with computational tools and flight assets) are still crit-
ical  components  of  a  research  and  technology  program;  that  nearly  all  of  the  facili-
ties  studied  can  serve  strategic  national  needs  (but  not  necessarily  NASA  needs,  a
point  to  which  we  will  return  below);  that  NASA’s  portfolio  of  facilities  is  in  mixed
health;  and  that  NASA  should  provide  some  type  of  shared  financial  support  to  a
minimum set of test facilities.

With  respect  to  their  specific  recommendations,  we  agree  that  it  is  important  to
develop  an  aeronautics  test  technology  vision  (although  we  would  stress  that  such
a  vision  should  be  driven  by,  and  an  integral  part  of,  and  overall  national  aero-
nautics policy); that NASA should continue to develop plans to modernize facilities;
that  NASA  should  prescribe  common  management  and  accounting  guidance  for
these facilities; and that NASA should work with the Department of Defense to ad-
dress  the  viability  of  a  ‘‘national  reliance  plan’’  for  major  ground  test  facilities.  In
fact,  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate  is  pursuing  implementation
of  all  of  these  recommendations  as  part  of  the  FY  2006  and  FY  2007  budget  proc-
esses.

As mentioned above, however, RAND developed and used a methodology that can
be  applied  as  national  and  programmatic  requirements  continue  to  evolve.  As  does
any such study of this type, the RAND study began with, and was grounded in, an
assessment  of  future  national  aeronautics-related  research  and  technology  require-
ments,  as  well  as  in  an  assessment  of  the  total  available  suite  (government,  indus-
try,  and  academia)  of  major  ground  test  facilities.  As  either  national  and  pro-
grammatic requirements or the suite of available facilities changes, so does the min-
imum  set  of  facilities  that  NASA  may  need  to  retain.  In  particular,  NASA’s  pro-
jected programmatic requirements have evolved substantially since the RAND team
evaluated those requirements almost three years ago. In addition, RAND stated that
nearly  all  of  the  existing  NASA  facilities  served  national  needs,  not  necessarily
NASA needs. As requirements change, it may be more appropriate to have operators
other  than  NASA  (for  example,  the  DOD)  operate  specific  facilities  that  they  re-
quire,  but  that  NASA  may  not.  Finally,  from  the  perspective  of  efficient  facility  op-
eration,  it  may  make  more  sense  to  operate  a  somewhat  smaller  set  of  facilities  at
a higher rate of utilization than it does to operate a larger suite of facilities at lower
utilization  rates  (assuming,  of  course,  that  technical  requirements  can  be  satisfied
with  either  approach).  Given  these  three  factors  (i.e.,  evolving  NASA  requirements,
related  national  requirements,  and  efficient  facility  operation),  an  updated  applica-
tion  of  the  RAND  process  coupled  with  these  other  considerations  may  well  result
in  a  different  optimum  set  of  minimum  facilities  for  NASA  than  that  recommend
by RAND at the conclusion of their study.
Q5. The  National  Academies  panel  led  by  Dr.  Klineberg  recommended  that  ‘‘NASA
should reconstitute a long-term base research program, separate from the other
aeronautics technology programs and projects.’’

Q5a. Do you agree or disagree with that recommendation?
Q5b. If  you  agree  with  it,  what  level  of  funding  is  provided  for  that  base  research
program for each of the years FY06–10, where is the funding located, and what
is the content of the base research program?

A5a,b. NASA  agrees  with  the  intent  of  the  recommendations  to  ensure  adequate
level  of  funding  for  long-term  research.  Each  of  ARMD’s  three  programs  has  ap-
proximately  20  percent  of  the  funding  in  long-term  research.  In  the  outyears,  we
plan  to  consolidate  this  funding  into  a  new  Foundational  Technology  Program  that
captures  long-term  cross-cutting  base  research  &  technology  activities  as  well  as
those providing support of ARMD core competencies.

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. How has the percentage of NASA’s budget for aeronautics research changed over
the past decade and, in particular, over the last three years? Your budget presen-
tation  numbers  to  Committee  staffers  in  February  only  presented  total  program
dollars.  Under  Full-Cost  Accounting,  how  have  direct  expenditures  for  each  of
the NASA aeronautics programs (i.e., the procurement dollars, civil servant sal-
ary  dollars,  and  contractor  salary  dollars)  at  each  of  the  four  centers  (Ames,
Dryden,  Glenn,  Langley)  changed  over  the  past  three  years  and  how  is  NASA
proposing to change those numbers in FY06 and outyears?

A1. Please see data in the following graphs and tables:

1. Overall aeronautics funding level history
2. Percentage of NASA budget over the past two decades
3. Overall budget request
4. Four NASA Center breakdown according to preliminary planning

(Note:  HSR  and  AST  in  the  chart  below  refer  to  the  High  Speed  Research  and

Advanced Subsonic Technology programs.)

As  a  percentage  of  the  NASA  budget,  the  Aeronautics  budget  peaked  during  the
FY  1993  through  FY  1999  time  period  when  the  High  Speed  Research  (HSR)  and
the  Advanced  Subsonic  Technology  (AST)  Programs  existed.  Both  of  these  focused
programs  terminated  at  the  end  of  FY  1999  which  resulted  in  a  reduced  funding
level for Aeronautics.

Note:  The  Aeronautics  budget  numbers  are  not  full  cost;  they  do  not  include  per-

sonnel costs, such as salaries and travel and Institutional CoF

The table below reflects FY 2003 Constant-year dollars (inflated).

Q2. How extensively has NASA consulted with the airlines and with pilots’ organiza-
tions  on  what  types  of  R&D  are  most  crucial  to  aviation  safety  and  to  the  effi-
ciency of operations? How are the airlines’ perspectives represented in the prior-
ities of the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD)?

A2. From  its  inception  as  the  Aviation  Safety  Program  in  2000,  the  management
team of the Aviation Safety and Security Program (AvSSP) has proactively reached
out to the airlines in defining and assessing its research and development portfolio.
In  program  and  project  formulation  phases,  AvSSP  has  conducted  well-attended
planning  workshops  that  have  included  all  sectors  of  the  aviation  community,  in-
cluding  representatives  from  airlines  and  the  Air  Transport  Association,  as  well  as
airline pilot unions.

In  many  of  the  Program’s  research  activities,  project  managers  conduct  User
Needs  studies.  Through  these  studies,  project  managers  and  principal  investigators
conduct  focused  interviews  with  product  user  representatives  to  identify  user-spe-
cific issues and capability gaps. The product user representatives usually target air-
line  and  pilot  representatives.  This  information  is  used  to  formulate  specific  re-
search issues and guide and focus research and development activities.

For  program  relevance  reviews,  airline  representatives  have  always  been  mem-
bers  of  the  AvSSP  review  teams.  Currently,  the  AvSSP  relevance  reviews  are  con-
ducted under the Federal Advisory Committee framework, with a subcommittee spe-
cifically to review the AvSSP.

The  AvSSP  is  a  voting  member  of  the  Commercial  Aviation  Strategy  Team
(CAST), which is the entity within the U.S. that is defining and implementing com-
mercial  aviation  safety  enhancements  that  are  projected  to  decrease  the  U.S.  fatal
accident rate by 73 percent. CAST is chaired by both an FAA official and an airline
representative.  Manufacturers  and  pilot  organizations  are  also  represented  on
CAST.  The  AvSSP  Program  Manager  is  a  member  of  the  CAST  Executive  Com-
mittee, which manages the CAST processes and defines the strategic direction of the
group.

AvSSP  has  been  successful  in  achieving  airline  participation  in  its  research  and
development efforts. Through NASA Research Announcements, research teams were
selected  that  have  included  airline  members.  Currently,  NASA  technologies  are
being  flown  on  revenue  flights  with  two  airline  partners,  Delta  and  Mesaba  (a  re-
gional airline).
Q3. In  your  opinion,  what  are  the  aeronautical  R&D  activities  for  which  a  govern-
ment laboratory is required or best suited for the job? For example, how can the
private  sector  analyze  flight  safety  issues  across  the  industry  free  of  conflicts  of
interests or promote expensive long-range developments that cannot be profitable
for at least a decade?

A3. Problems  with  the  environment  and  other  elements  of  the  aviation  infrastruc-
ture, such as air system capacity and air traffic control are not easily addressed by
the  private  sector.  The  resulting  delays,  noise  and  emissions  pollution  are  not  even
priced  in  the  marketplace.  Economists  term  these  problems  ‘‘externalities’’  because,
unlike  other  costs,  no  market  participant  pays  for  them  directly.  As  a  result,  the
private sector has inadequate incentive for addressing the very real challenges asso-
ciated  with  aviation.  This  is  the  situation  at  work  in  the  example  of  expecting  the
private  sector  to  analyze  flight  safety,  or  the  promotion  of  long-range  activities-nei-
ther  will  be  profitable  in  the  near-term,  and  there  is  no  obvious  single  or  shared
point of responsibility among the competitors in the marketplace.

Developing,  maintaining,  and  regulating  national  transportation  infrastructures,
as  well  as  other  significant  areas  such  as  national  security,  are  the  responsibilities
of the government. The civil R&D activities required in this task include air system
capacity (which is a complex ‘‘system of systems,’’ including human performance ele-
ments, cockpit design and communications), noise and emissions reduction, aviation
safety,  and  elements  of  security.  Many  NASA  stakeholders  and  customers  believe
the government also has responsibility for maintaining a strong technology base for
air  and  space  transportation  to  ensure  competitiveness  of  the  U.S.  economy.  New
technologies as well as technology advances in traditional and emerging study areas
of  aeronautics,  such  as  power  and  propulsion,  materials  and  structures,  aero-
dynamics,  etc.,  will  enable  the  private  sector  to  develop  new  capabilities  and  oper-
ating paradigms into products and services that will compete globally.

This is a multifaceted issue that government can affect as a direct or indirect re-
sult  of  policy.  The  aerospace  industry  remains  critically  dependent  on  technology.
Even as NASA’s priorities change to meet the changing needs of society, it still pur-
sues  long-term  efforts  in  aerospace  science  and  technology;  efforts  that  would  not
be  made  otherwise,  by  the  private  sector  or  other  government  agencies.  NASA  con-
tinues  to  play  a  unique  role  by  connecting  research  infrastructure  in  both  the  pri-
vate  and  public  sectors.  In  this  regard,  partnerships  remain  a  critical  element  in
disseminating and applying NASA-developed technologies.
Q4. How  will  the  proposed  reductions  in  NASA’s  aeronautics  budget  help  bolster
American’s  global  leadership  in  aviation?  How  will  the  budget  cuts  impact
NASA’s  ability  to  support  the  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office’s  Inte-
grated  Plan?  In  your  best  judgment,  do  you  believe  the  proposed  cuts  will  be
good for NASA aeronautics, the Agency, the JPDO, and the Nation?

A4. NASA’s  Aeronautics  research  is  vital  to  the  Nation  in  our  work  for  the  public
good  to  increase  safety,  reduce  adverse  environmental  impacts,  and  transform  air
transportation. This budget supports NASA’s emphasis to address basic aeronautical
barriers  confronting  our  national  aviation  system  and  supports  research  to  pioneer
and validate high-value technologies that enable new exploration and discovery, and
improve  the  quality  of  life  though  practical  applications.  The  President’s  FY  2006
Budget supports the Aeronautics program’s vital research in Aviation Safety and Se-
curity  and  Airspace  Systems.  To  ensure  maximum  benefit  to  the  taxpayer,  we  are
transforming  part  of  our  investment  in  Aeronautics  Research  investment  in  order
to more sharply focus the investment on revolutionary, high-risk, ‘‘barrier breaking’’
technologies.  Toward  this  end,  the  NASA  Aeronautics  Vehicle  Systems  Program
(VSP)  has  been  refocused  away  from  evolutionary  research  and  technology  develop-
ment  and  toward  more  revolutionary,  ‘‘barrier-breaking’’  technology  demonstration
projects  that  address  critical  public  needs  related  to  reduction  of  aircraft  noise  and
emissions,  and  enable  new  science  missions.  The  revolutionary  technologies  devel-
oped  by  NASA  within  the  next  decade  will  form  the  basis  for  a  new  generation  of
environmentally friendly aircraft and will enhance U.S. competitiveness in 20 years
from now.

NASA has a major role in the JPDO and the Next Generation Air Transportation
System (NGATS). While NASA is performing aeronautics research that provides the
foundation  to  enable  NGATS  and  the  right  strategies,  we  are  also  providing  civil
servants and direct support to the JPDO. NASA is providing civil service employees
to  serve  as  the  JPDO  Deputy  Director  (SES),  Agile  Air  Traffic  System  IPT  Lead
(SES),  and  a  Board  member  (SES),  as  well  as  11  other  full  or  part  time  civil  serv-
ants.  NASA  financial  support  to  the  JPDO  was  $5.4M  in  FY  2004.  This  has  in-
creased  to  $5.6M  in  FY  2005  and  is  currently  planned  to  increase  to  $10M  in  FY
2006. We are also conducting a network-enabled operations (NEO) demonstration of
security and capacity related technologies. This demonstration, jointly sponsored by
NASA, DOD, DHS, and DOT, could prove to be valuable in integrating government-
wide intelligence operations, providing significant aid to our national security.
Q5. With  a  large  portion  of  the  aeronautics  budget  being  set  aside  for  competition
among industry, universities, NASA centers, and others for very large technology
demonstrations,  how  can  ARMD  assure  that  the  remaining  budget  for  ‘‘seed
corn’’  be  large  enough  to  sustain  a  critical  mass  of  scientists  and  engineers  and
to address the Nation’s long-range critical needs?

A5. Approximately  20  percent  of  each  of  our  current  aeronautics  programs  is  tar-
geted toward basic research that provides the foundation for the next generation of
technology advancements required by NASA’s aeronautics’ goals.
Q6. Why  is  ARMD  ignoring  the  National  Research  Council’s  recommendation  to  set

up a new base long-term R&D program?

139

A6. NASA agrees with the intent of the NRC’s recommendations for long-term basic
research. Each of ARMD’s three programs has approximately 20 percent of the fund-
ing  in  long-term  research.  In  the  outyears,  we  are  considering  the  consolidation  of
this  funding  into  a  new  Foundational  Technology  Program  that  captures  long-term
cross-cutting  base  research  &  technology  activities  as  well  as  those  providing  sup-
port of ARMD core competencies.
Q7. How did ARMD participate in NASA’s Human Capital planning effort to target
more than 2,000 civil service jobs for elimination by the beginning of FY07? How
was  it  determined  that  Dryden,  Glenn,  and  Langley  were  to  lose  more  than  a
third of their aeronautics technical employees? With such substantial reductions
in  the  number  of  scientists  and  engineers  at  NASA  centers  conducting  aero-
nautics  R&D  projected  in  your  budget  plans,  will  your  programs  be  able  to
maintain  their  current  exemplary  technical  quality?  Will  it  be  possible  to  reac-
quire these lost skills, if this move were to prove unwise?

A7. The process of projecting future aeronautics-related workforce levels and facility
needs  at  the  Research  Centers  begins  with  the  programmatic  requirements  estab-
lished  by  the  Agency  through  the  annual  programming  and  budget  development
process,  culminating  with  the  preparation  of  (in  this  case)  the  FY  2006  President’s
budget as submitted to Congress. The FY 2006 NASA budget reflects a major trans-
formation  in  both  the  content  and  conduct  of  the  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Di-
rectorate’s programs. With respect to content, the ARMD program, in particular the
Vehicle Systems Program, has been transformed to focus on four ‘‘barrier-breaking’’
technology demonstrations, emphasizing higher-risk research where the private sec-
tor  will  not  optimally  invest  due  to  risk  and  anticipated  rate  of  return  (as  opposed
to  more  near-term  development  programs  that  are  typically  the  purview  of  the  pri-
vate sector). With respect to conduct, ARMD will be placing a renewed emphasis on
realizing best value for the taxpayer’s investment through a combination of competi-
tion models. One aspect of the increased use of competition is expected to be a great-
er contribution by the private sector to the conduct of NASA’s aeronautics research.
ARMD,  working  with  the  Research  Centers  and  the  Agency’s  human  capital  plan-
ning  community,  then  quantified  the  impact  on  workforce  (and  facility)  require-
ments of this combination of a more focused research effort and an increased private
sector  role.  At  the  same  time,  changing  requirements  from  other  Mission  Direc-
torates  either  added  to  or  reduced  the  total  workforce  projection,  resulting  in  the
final numbers inherent in the FY 2006 budget submit.

Although  there  are  numerous  human  capital  management  changes  associated
with implementing a change of this magnitude, including some near-term issues as-
sociated  with  buyouts  and  other  workforce  transition  mechanisms,  we  believe  that
the Research Centers will retain the quality technical workforce required by ARMD
for successful execution of its future programs. As part of the final phase of the on-
going  NASA  Core  Competency  exercise,  NASA  will  address  any  issues  of  potential
loss of skills that may be required by other Agency programs in the future.
Q8. How are you planning on safeguarding your critical aeronautics facilities (wind
tunnels,  simulators,  virtual  control  tower,  etc.. . .)?  In  particular,  how  are  you
coordinating with Admiral Steidle to save ‘‘dual-use’’ facilities that support both
aeronautics  and  space  exploration  efforts?  For  example,  recently,  at  Ames,  doz-
ens  of  contract  employees  who  have  worked  at  the  Vertical  Motion  Simulator
were  let  go  (some  had  extremely  specific  valuable  expertise  and  experience  hav-
ing  worked  there  for  decades)  leaving  the  facility  all  but  shutdown.  Why  is  this
being  allowed  to  happen  given  the  historical  support  of  this  unique  facility  for
aeronautics testing of human-system control interactions, for shuttle pilot train-
ing, and the likely future critical need for CEV development work?

A8. Recognizing  the  importance  of  major  test  facilities  to  both  NASA  and  the  Na-
tion,  the  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate  is  considering  a  new  approach
to  the  management  of  major  ground  test  facilities.  Through  an  Aeronautics  Test
Program  (ATP),  ARMD  would  plan  to  make  a  strategic  investment  in  such  facili-
ties—in  some  cases  to  ensure  continued  operational  availability  and  in  some  cases
to  ensure  that  a  minimal  level  of  funds  are  available  until  future  users  require
those facilities. Discussions with other current and potential users, including but not
limited  to  the  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate,  have  been  an  integral  part
of  the  investment  process.  Through  the  ATP,  NASA  would  be  able  to  ensure  that
critical facilities are available for an additional period of time while future require-
ments  develop.  With  respect  to  the  Vertical  Motion  Simulator  (VMS)  at  Ames,  con-
tract  layoffs  during  FY  2005  have  been  required  in  order  to  accommodate  decisions
made  regarding  Congressional  earmarks.  Future  requirements  for  the  VMS  are
being defined as part of the ongoing budget process.

Q9. Is NASA able to provide the stable, predictable funding of individual long-range
R&D studies necessary for success? What percentage of time are NASA scientists
and  engineers  expected  to  devote  to  conducting  R&D  versus  program  planning,
reporting, advocacy, and proposal writing? Under this environment, how do you
foresee NASA’s ability to continue despite the GS wage penalty to recruit the best
and  the  brightest  who  used  to  come  to  NASA  to  avoid  these  hassles  in  the  pri-
vate  sector  and  academia  and  to  focus  instead  nearly  exclusively  on  cool  R&D?
If  individuals  or  groups  of  entrepreneurial  scientists  and  engineers  are  respon-
sible  for  teaming  and  finding  their  own  ‘‘seed  corn’’  or  for  finding  their  own
niche  in  a  large  external  proposal  as  well  as  performing  the  R&D  itself,  what
then is the role of management?

A9. As  part  of  the  transformation  of  the  aeronautics  research  program,  the  Aero-
nautics  Research  Mission  Directorate 
in  the  process  of  establishing  a
‘‘foundational  technology’’  effort  that  will  provide  the  long  range  ‘‘seed  corn’’  for  fu-
ture  breakthrough  demonstrations.  At  the  moment,  the  foundational  technology  ef-
fort comprises three components—basic research and development, university-based
fundamental and applied research, and a strategic investment in major aeronautics
test  facilities.  The  combination  of  these  investments  will  enable  ARMD  to  support
a stable, ongoing effort in longer-term R&D.
Q10. By setting aside a large portion of the aeronautics budget for a very small num-
ber of large demonstration projects in which corporations will play a large role,
is  not  ARMD  prejudging  which  areas  of  industry  should  prosper  over  others?
How  is  such  an  approach  consistent  with  free  and  open  competition?  Further-
more,  consider  an  analogy  to  NIH’s  successful  campaign  to  eradicate  polio,  in
which  NIH  chose  to  support  a  wide  array  of  long-range,  science-driven  studies
to discover the polio virus, how it infests humans, and how it could be stopped
from  doing  so,  rather  than  striving  to  develop  more  technologically-advanced
iron lungs. What evidence is there that large government investment in a small
number of expensive demonstration projects is the best approach to stimulating
bona fide technology breakthroughs?

A10. By  focusing  the  Aeronautics  Research  program  on  breakthrough  demonstra-
tions,  NASA  will  actually  be  expanding—not  limiting—the  areas  in  which  others
might  invest.  These  demonstration  efforts  will  address  technologies  and  concepts
that are still too unproven or risky to attract attention and capital from the private
sector  or  other  interested  parties.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  selection  of  the
demonstrations themselves has been, and will be, guided by inputs from a wide va-
riety  of  sources,  including  the  National  Research  Council.  NASA  feels  it  can  con-
tinue  to  attract  the  best  and  brightest  to  perform  aeronautics  research.  The  dem-
onstration  projects  offer  opportunities  for  scientists  and  engineers  to  be  part  of
breakthroughs, such as our recent success on the X–43A program. And, as noted in
Questions 5 and 6 above, the long-term basic research offers opportunities for high-
risk research that may lead to future demonstrations. NASA has had success in ad-
vancing  the  state-of-the-art  in  aeronautical  research  and  technology  using  both  fo-
cused demonstrations and a broader, more fundamental research effort. And, NASA
plans  to  continue  pursuing  both  avenues  through  the  combination  of  the  barrier-
breaking  demonstrations  and  a  fundamental  technology  investment.  The  ARMD
Program as submitted in the FY 2006 budget simply shifts the balance between the
breakthrough and the fundamental to optimize the government’s investment.
Q11. Four  of  the  five  Field  Centers  that  are  reporting  extreme  workforce  distress
have  had  a  tradition  of  focusing  on  aeronautics.  Why  do  you  think  that  your
centers  and  Ames  are  planning  such  dramatic  workforce  downsizing?  Does  it
not  worry  you  that  these  Centers  are  planning  on  losing  more  than  a  third  of
a workforce that has dedicated their lives to primarily to aeronautics, many of
whom  have  been  and  continue  to  be  world-class  contributors  to  NASA’s  mis-
sion?  How  is  this  consistent  with  the  ‘‘NASA  family’’  value  that  management
has  been  touting?  Do  you  believe  this  course  of  action  is  best  for  the  future  of
NASA aeronautics, the Agency, and the Nation?

A11. This question was addressed in #7 above.
Q12. Are you not worried that the increase of direct NASA funding to aircraft manu-
facturers, such as Boeing, or other aeronautics industry entities that may result
from  NASA’s  ‘‘competition’’  for  aeronautics  R&D  work  will  violate  the  GATT?
If not, why not?

A12. The  objective  of  increased  competition  is  to  ensure  the  best  value  for  the  tax-
payers’ money. The aeronautics research that will be completed targets technologies

that  are  ‘‘beyond  the  horizon’’  of  the  aeronautics  industry.  Since  the  results  are
available equally to all of industry, it is not a violation of GATT.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  John  M.  Klineberg,  Committee  Chairman,  National  Research  Council

Panel

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  study  recommended  that  NASA  ‘‘dispose  of
underutilized  facilities.’’  What  did  the  Academy  mean  by  that?  Should  NASA
consider  any  factors  other  than  current  utilization  in  deciding  which  wind  tun-
nels  to  maintain?  Do  you  believe  that  NASA  needs  to  close  down  at  least  some
of its wind tunnels to maintain a viable research program given the budget out-
look?

A1. Our  committee  completed  its  report  in  November  2003,  before  the  latest  round
of  budget  cuts.  At  that  time  we  already  were  concerned  that  NASA  was  trying  to
do  too  much  within  the  available  funding.  For  this  reason,  we  recommended  that
NASA  ‘‘continue  to  dispose  of  underutilized  facilities,’’  meaning  that  they  should
continue to look at their facilities, particularly those that were not unique, with the
goal of consolidation or deactivation as a way to reduce long-term fixed costs.

We  specifically  recommended  that  NASA  not  use  current  utilization  as  the  only
consideration  in  deciding  which  facilities  to  close.  In  our  comments  about  full-cost
accounting,  we  stated  the  following:  ‘‘The  committee  is  concerned  that,  if  not  care-
fully  managed,  full-cost  accounting  could  result  in  (1)  the  closure  of  critical  infra-
structure  and  special-purpose  facilities  that  will  be  needed  for  future  program  exe-
cution and (2) a disincentive to use large-scale facilities and flight test to fully dem-
onstrate technology readiness.’’ As a result of item (2), we cautioned that: ‘‘The test-
ing  infrastructure  will  be  underutilized  and  will  not  generate  the  resources  needed
to sustain it.’’

Given the budget outlook, it is evident that NASA needs to do everything possible,
including placing some of its wind tunnels in stand-by mode, to attempt to maintain
a  viable  research  program.  It  is  very  possible  that  they  already  have  decommis-
sioned all the facilities that are appropriate to close. My personal concern, as I stat-
ed  in  my  testimony  to  the  Committee,  is  that  the  current  reduced  funding  levels
may  have  put  NASA  very  close  to  the  point  at  which  ‘‘This  program  is  on  its  way
to becoming irrelevant to the future of aeronautics in this country and in the world.’’
Q2. If  the  budget  for  aeronautics  is  limited,  is  it  more  important  for  NASA  to  fund
long-term, high-risk research or to continue with incremental subsonic research?
Should improving air traffic control be the top priority for NASA’s research pro-
gram?

A2. This  critical  issue  was  not  addressed  by  our  National  Academies  Committee.
The NASA Administrator, the Associate Administrator for Aeronautics, the program
managers  at  NASA  headquarters  and  their  counterparts  at  the  field  centers,  work-
ing in conjunction with the various aeronautics advisory committees, all are respon-
sible for addressing this question.

Our committee did not set priorities among the various parts of the program. We
were  chartered  to  assess  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Technology  Programs  at  their  then
(FY 2003) funding level, which we did by performing an in-depth examination of the
various  technical  elements  to  identify  strengths  and  weaknesses.  We  attempted  to
answer the following four questions:

1. Is the array of activities about right?
2. Is there a good plan to carry out the program?
3. Is the program doing what it set out to do?
4. Is the entire effort connected to the users?

Our  conclusion  was  that  ‘‘in  general,  the  Aeronautics  Technology  programs  are
very  good  but  could  be  greatly  improved  by  following  the  committee’s  12  top-level
recommendations.’’

I  believe  our  committee  would  agree  that  the  answer  to  the  question  of  priorities
is  that  it  is  important  to  pursue  both  long-term  and  short-term  research.  We  need
to continue to improve the reliability, safety and cost effectiveness of subsonic trans-
ports and the effectiveness of the air traffic control system. And we also need to in-
vestigate ‘‘innovative concepts that are critical to meeting aviation needs in the next
decades.’’

NASA  should  develop  advanced  technology  that  addresses  today’s  critical  prob-
lems  in  air  transportation.  NASA  also  should  establish  the  technical  foundation  for

143

future  improvements  that  may  be  beyond  the  time  horizon  of  the  industry  or  the
FAA.
Q3. How high a priority should research on hypersonics be? If NASA aeronautics re-
search  were  flat  funded  in  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  06,  that  is,  given  $54  million  more
than the President has proposed, where would you put that money?

A3. Our  National  Academies  Committee  did  not  address  these  issues,  of  course,
since  they  are  primarily  directed  at  decisions  concerning  NASA’s  FY  2006  aero-
nautics budget.

The  Committee  did  conclude,  however,  that  hypersonics  was  an  appropriate  area
for  research  and  that  it  was  an  example  of  the  high-risk,  high-payoff  technologies
that NASA should pursue. The Hyper-X sub-project also was identified as one of the
best planned activities in the entire program. The Committee’s support for research
in  this  area  was  not  so  much  because  we  were  convinced  in  the  potential  viability
of  a  hypersonic-cruise  airplane,  but  because  we  believed  that  hypersonics  serves  as
an  important  focus  for  innovative  thinking  about  advanced  concepts  in  propulsion,
aerodynamics, structures, materials, controls, handling qualities, etc.

As to where to put the additional funds, an increase of $54 million, even if it does
not fully restore the FY 2006 run-outs to the earlier program, is a very substantial
change.  I  would  recommend  that  NASA  be  allowed  to  re-plan  the  aeronautics  pro-
gram to the new funding level with the goal of reducing some of the onerous disrup-
tions previously contemplated.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. Some have argued that aviation is a mature industry and thus the Federal Gov-
ernment  should  no  longer  invest  in  aeronautics  R&D.  Do  you  agree  or  disagree
with that conclusion?

A1. I  personally  do  not  believe  that  aviation  is  a  mature  industry.  In  fact,  I  would
argue  that  it  is  an  industry  that  will  change  dramatically  in  the  near  future  if  it
is  to  remain  viable.  Commercial  air  transportation  is  so  vital  to  the  economic  well-
being  of  this  country  that  it  cannot  be  allowed  to  become  a  major  inhibitor  of  in-
creased productivity.

The  pressures  for  change  are  there,  for  example  in  the  financial  problems  cur-
rently  experienced  by  all  major  airlines,  problems  that  are  becoming  worse  as  the
price of jet fuel increases. Air travel also has become less enjoyable for the traveling
public, with long lines for security at airports, fewer on-time arrivals and more fre-
quent  delays  because  of  air  traffic  congestion.  The  entire  commercial  air  transpor-
tation system seems to be headed for eventual gridlock.

On the manufacturing side, Boeing, our single remaining commercial aircraft pro-
vider  and  the  largest  exporter  of  U.S.  products,  is  facing  serious  competition  in  the
world  market  from  a  subsidized  European  competitor  and  may  not  be  able  to  be
profitable in building commercial transport aircraft. And our jet engine manufactur-
ers, Pratt and General Electric, need the revenue from the service business and the
sale of derivative stationary power plants to remain in business. A viable air trans-
portation  system  will  not  be  possible  unless  all  of  its  components  have  the  oppor-
tunity for dramatic improvement.

The solutions are complex. We need to develop advanced transport aircraft of var-
ious  sizes  and  different  capabilities  that  are  considerably  more  fuel  efficient,  easier
to  maintain,  and  more  environmentally  friendly  than  the  current  fleet.  We  need  to
develop  aircraft  that  can  be  operated  by  one  or  two  on-board  personnel  supervising
the  control  system  of  a  semi-autonomous  vehicle,  rather  than  operated  by  highly-
trained (and costly) pilots and crew as we do today. And we need transport aircraft
that  are  as  part  of  an  efficient,  safe,  secure,  weather-independent  and  predictable
world-wide  air  traffic  control  system.  Aeronautics  R&D  certainly  can  help  provide
the foundation for these improvements.
Q2. Your  panel  recommended  that  ‘‘NASA  should  conduct  research  in  selective
areas  relevant  to  rotorcraft.’’  Why  did  your  panel  make  that  recommendation?
What areas did the panel consider to be worthy of research by NASA?

A2. Our  committee  was  unhappy  to  learn  that  NASA  had  abandoned  all  rotorcraft
research  because  the  OMB  apparently  had  decided  that  because  the  Army  is  a
major  beneficiary  of  such  work,  the  research  should  be  funded  as  part  of  the  DOD
budget. This is a narrow point of view and ignores the difficulty of having an oper-
ational organization be responsible for R&D. As a result, rotorcraft research in this
country has suffered in recent years.

The committee felt that rotary wing aircraft are probably the aeronautical vehicle
system  most  in  need  of  substantial  technology  advancements  in  structures,  mate-
rials,  aerodynamics,  displays,  controls  and  handling  qualities  if  they  are  to  become
more efficient, safer and more reliable. These areas of disciplinary research deserve
attention by NASA.

The committee made several specific suggestions in the report, as follows: ‘‘Rotor-
craft  are  an  important  constituent  of  air  transportation.  Many  of  the  research
projects  currently  underway  in  the  Aeronautics  Technology  Programs,  such  as  syn-
thetic  vision  and  human  factors,  would  be  directly  relevant  to  rotorcraft  with  only
minimal additional investment. NASA could make a significant impact in under-re-
searched  areas  of  rotorcraft  such  as  decision  aids,  synthetic  vision,  pilot  workload,
and  situational  awareness.  Further,  the  existing  U.S.  Army  programs  in  rotorcraft
technologies and industry research and development in rotorcraft could be leveraged
by NASA to meet civilian needs in this area.’’

This  recommendation  was  stated  in  another  section  of  the  report  as  follows:
‘‘NASA led many of the revolutions in rotorcraft design that we now find in the com-
mercial  and  military  sectors.  Unfortunately,  however,  the  NASA  plans  reviewed  by
the  panel  had  no  focused  rotorcraft  activities.  If  the  U.S.  rotorcraft  industry  is  to
remain competitive in the international marketplace, NASA leadership and innova-
tion  will  be  required  to  respond  to  the  European  and  Asian  products  now  entering
the market.’’
Q3. Your  testimony  states  that  ‘‘. . .NASA’s  decision  to  discontinue  rotorcraft  re-
search  has  left  critical  civilian  needs  unaddressed.’’  Can  you  provide  some  spe-
cific examples of critical needs that will be unaddressed?

A3. This  question  is  answered,  in  part,  above.  In  addition,  some  examples  are  con-
tained  in  on  of  the  Committee’s  specific  recommendations  in  the  report,  as  follows:
‘‘The  Aviation  Safety  Program  should  reincorporate  rotorcraft  research  into  its  pro-
gram.  The  research  should  consider  the  most  effective  approaches  for  reducing  the
workload  of  rotorcraft  pilots  and  improving  their  ability  to  conduct  safe,  low  speed,
low  altitude  rotorcraft  operations  in  obstacle-rich  environments  and  in  adverse
weather.’’

Rotorcraft  have  many  specific  civilian  applications,  such  as  in  medical  emer-
gencies,  highway  traffic  monitoring  and  control,  police  assistance  of  all  kinds  and
logging in remote regions. One of their major uses, in this era of increasingly limited
energy  supplies,  is  in  the  maintenance  and  supply  of  off-shore  drilling  platforms
throughout  the  world.  Many  aspects  of  these  civilian  operations  are  not  address  by
technology activities that focus only on military requirements.
Q4. What  will  be  the  impact  of  OMB’s  directive  to  NASA  eliminating  federal  re-

search in subsonic transport aeronautics?
Will  it  be  possible  to  make  major  breakthroughs  in  noise  and  fuel  consumption
and  aviation  safety  and  security  research  in  the  future  without  being  able  to
treat the subsonic transport aircraft as an integrated system?

A4. Our committee completed its report in November 2003 and therefore did not re-
view NASA’s response to this latest round of budget cuts. At that earlier time, how-
ever,  we  already  were  concerned  about  the  lack  of  funding  for  important  areas  of
research  that  could  provide  major  breakthroughs  to  enable  the  air  transportation
system of the future.

The  committee  made  the  following  recommendation  in  the  report:  ‘‘Many  innova-
tive concepts that are critical to meeting aviation needs in the next decades will not
be pursued by industry or the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). NASA should
fill  this  void.  The  committee  applauds  the  inclusion  of  high-risk,  revolutionary  sub-
projects  in  many  areas  and  believes  the  program  portfolio  could  benefit  from  addi-
tional  far-reaching  efforts  with  the  potential  for  high  payoff.  This  type  of  research
is critical to investigating the feasibility of innovative concepts and reducing risk to
the  point  where  the  concepts  are  suitable  for  advanced  development  and  transfer
to industry or the FAA.’’
Q5. Did  your  panel  consider  hypersonics  research  to  be  an  appropriate  activity  for

NASA to pursue? Why or why not?

A5. Our  committee  believed  strongly  that  hypersonic  research  was  an  appropriate
area  for  NASA  research  and  that  it  was  very  much  in  keeping  with  one  of  the  top-
level recommendations, that ‘‘NASA should pursue more high-risk, high-payoff tech-
nologies.’’

One  of  the  major  activities  in  hypersonics  was  singled  out  for  praise  as  follows:
‘‘The  Hyper-X  sub-project  shows  some  of  the  best  planning  seen  across  all  the  pro-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:40 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 020007 PO 00000 Frm 00148 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\031605\20007 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

145

grams reviewed by the committee. The NASA planning reflects the high-risk aspect
of  this  task  by  providing  for  three  vehicles  and  anticipating  possible  loss.  The  first
flight test was not successful because a rocket booster failed, demonstrating the wis-
dom of the contingency aspect of this plan.’’

The  committee  continued  its  uncharacteristic  praise  as  follows:  ‘‘The  sub-project
is  well  connected  programmatically  to  its  antecedents,  another  of  its  notable  fea-
tures.  Indeed,  many  of  the  detailed  aspects  to  be  investigated  are  directed  at  an-
swering  key  questions  surrounding  hypersonic  flight.  By  virtue  of  careful  consider-
ation of this background and good planning, the goals of the sub-project are realistic
and  the  risk  associated  with  it  has  been  mitigated.  The  ultimate  goal  is  to  dem-
onstrate positive net thrust of the scramjet; this is a laudable, though difficult, goal
that the committee hopes can be achieved.’’
Q6. Is  NASA’s  establishment  of  a  focused  effort  in  four  breakthrough  technology
demonstration  projects  fully  responsive  to  the  findings  and  recommendations  of
your  panel  regarding  NASA’s  overall  Vehicle  Systems  program?  Are  the  goals
of  the  demonstration  projects  achievable  under  the  Vehicle  Systems  five-year
budget plan?

A6. Again, our committee completed its report in November 2003 and therefore did
not  review  NASA’s  response  to  the  latest  round  of  budget  cuts.  The  ground  rules
we  established  for  our  committee  precluded  us  from  recommending  an  increase  in
funding for NASA so that we could focus on providing an independent review of the
technical  quality  of  the  work  being  conducted.  At  that  time,  however,  we  already
were  concerned  that  NASA  was  attempting  to  do  too  much  within  the  available
budget,  and  for  this  reason  we  recommended  that  NASA  attempt  to  improve  its
processes  for  program  management,  reduce  the  number  of  tasks  in  its  technology
portfolio and consolidate or deactivate underutilized aeronautics facilities.

The current budget is considerably reduced from the one we reviewed and as such
makes continued progress even more difficult. As I said in my oral testimony before
the  committee:  ‘‘This  program  is  on  its  way  to  becoming  irrelevant  to  the  future  of
aeronautics in this country and in the world.’’
Q7. Your  panel  recommended  that  ‘‘NASA  should  reconstitute  a  long-term  base  re-
search  program,  separate  from  other  aeronautics  technology  projects  and  pro-
grams.’’
What would such a base research program consist of, and does the restructured
aeronautics  R&D  program  contained  in  NASA’s  FY  2006  budget  request  ade-
quately address your panel’s recommendation?

A7. The committee’s concern about NASA’s base research program was of such mag-
nitude  that  it  was  addressed  in  three  top-level  recommendations,  as  follows:  NASA
should  eliminate  arbitrary  time  constraints  on  program  completion. . .  NASA
should pursue more high-risk, high-payoff technologies. . . and NASA should recon-
stitute  a  long-term  base  research  program,  separate  from  the  other  aeronautics
technology programs and projects.’’

This  last  recommendation  was  further  elaborated  as  follows:  ‘‘The  current  re-
search  is  mostly  product-driven,  with  not  enough  fundamental  work.  Fundamental
research  is  crucial  for  the  development  of  future  products.  NASA  needs  to  provide
researchers  the  opportunity  to  conduct  forward-looking,  basic  research  that  is
unencumbered  by  short-term,  highly  specified  goals  and  milestones.  Historically,
NASA  has  been  a  world  leader  in  its  core  research  areas;  however,  that  base  has
eroded  in  recent  years  as  the  amount  of  in-house  basic  research  diminishes.  NASA
needs to reassess its core competencies and assure their support through a base re-
search program.’’

We  have  not  been  briefed  on  NASA’s  FY  2006  budget  request  to  be  certain  that
this  recommendation  has  been  adequately  addressed.  We  suspect  that,  because  of
the  very  serious  fiscal  constraints  imposed  on  the  program,  there  is  no  longer  ade-
quate funding for NASA to pursue those technologies that have a high risk of unsuc-
cessful completion (high risk/high payoff) and that the industry is unwilling to fund
on  its  own.  Unfortunately,  over  the  past  two  decades  the  industry  has  reduced  its
investment  in  basic  research,  which  serves  at  the  seed  corn  for  future  technology
opportunities.  The  committee  was  very  concerned  that  NASA  aeronautics  is  fol-
lowing this same path.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Philip S. Anto´n, Director, Center for Acquisition and Technology Policy,

RAND1

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. Is aeronautics mature?
A1. Parts of aeronautics are mature while others are evolving. Some aeronautic sec-
tors have shown marked reductions in new vehicle development rates, and the aero-
nautic  engineering  discipline  is  relatively  mature  compared  to  where  we  were  dec-
ades ago. However, we have not exhausted all aeronautic design opportunities, and
aeronautic  engineering  discipline  maturity  relies  on  the  test  infrastructure  that
America has developed.

Some  have  argued  that  aeronautics  is  a  ‘‘mature’’  industry  and  thus  the  Federal

Government should no longer invest in aeronautics R&D or test infrastructures.

Earlier  in  my  testimony  I  noted  that  the  aeronautics  industry  has  matured,  but
the  question  of  industry  maturity  consists  of  two  major  components:  market  matu-
rity  (i.e.,  whether  aeronautic  vehicle  designs  have  stagnated),  and  engineering  ma-
turity  (i.e.,  the  degree  to  which  engineers  know  how  to  research,  design,  and
produce new aeronautic concepts).

While  some  aeronautics  markets  are  mature  in  that  they  are  ‘‘no  longer  the  sub-
ject of great expansion or development’’ 2 in raw design numbers, other markets are
expanding to explore continued evolutionary development or even revolutionary con-
cepts.

There  has  been  a  marked  decline  in  the  number  of  new  major  civil  and  military
aircraft  designs  since  the  1950s.3 However,  the  U.S.  and  foreign  countries  are  con-
tinuing to push the design envelopes in the vehicles it is developing (including effi-
ciencies,  noise  reductions,  capacity  increases,  increased  aeronautic  performance,  re-
ductions  in  takeoff  and  landing  length  requirements,  and  hybridization  of  vertical-
takeoff-and-landing  capabilities  with  traditional  jet  flight.)  Also,  the  U.S.  is  explor-
ing new vehicle types and concepts. For example, many unmanned air vehicles and
unmanned  combat  air  vehicle  concepts  are  being  researched,  developed,  and  pro-
duced.  Military  concepts  for  larger  vertical-takeoff-and-landing  (VTOL)  and  super-
short  take-off-and-landing  (SSTOL)  transport  require  continued  R&D.  Interests  in
commercial supersonic business jets require additional R&D for vehicle designs and
sonic  boom  reduction.  Air-breathing  hypersonic  concepts  employing  ramjet  and
scramjet  engines  are  in  their  infancy  yet  hold  potential  for  space  access,  aerospace
planes, and military missiles.

The  aeronautics  community  itself  has  been  grappling  with  the  question  of  how
many potentially valuable opportunities await our examination. Professor Ilan Kroo
of  Stanford  University,  for  example,  laid  out  the  data  that  seems  to  indicate  a  lack
of  innovation  giving  the  appearance  of  maturity,  but  he  also  outlined  some  innova-
tive  concepts  that  indicate  the  field  has  significant  expansion  and  development  op-
portunities.4 Also,  the  NASA  Blueprint5 discusses  a  number  of  R&D  concepts  that
NASA is considering. Other aeronautic trends and interests are listed in the RAND
Corporation’s study on test facilities.6

There  are  technical  challenges  in  many  of  these  concepts,  but  that  is  the  nature
of R&D, requiring careful consideration, exploration, and engagement on these chal-
lenges to understand their ultimate viability and benefits.

Thus,  U.S.  aeronautics  industry  ‘‘maturity’’  (lack  of  great  expansion  or  develop-
ment) is less a question of needs and opportunities and more a question of national
intent,  investment  levels,  and  policy.  For  example,  the  cost  to  produce  new  vehicle
designs  continues  to  rise,  and  that  has  a  constraining  effect  on  development  rates
but not absolute cessation of development opportunities.

Conversely, while only parts of the aeronautics industry are relatively mature, the
discipline of aeronautics engineering shows a level of maturity. In particular, while
we  do  not  have  complete,  closed-form  understanding  of  the  aeronautic  physics  in
which  our  vehicle  components  operate,  we  know  how  to  use  test  techniques  to  ex-
perimentally  explore  the  new  physical  realms  in  which  new  vehicle  concepts  oper-
ate.  This  is  especially  true  for  revolutionary  new  concepts  that  are  not  extensions
of established systems with which engineers have extensive practical design experi-
ence, computational models, and flight experience. Even improving the performance
at  the  margin  of  well-established  and  refined  designs  depends  on  appropriate  and
sufficient testing at wind tunnel and propulsion test facilities. Thus, aeronautic en-
gineering  discipline  maturity  relies  on  the  test  infrastructure  that  America  has  de-
veloped.
Q2. Did  the  DOD  attempt  to  use,  and  then  abandon,  full-cost  recovery  for  its  test

facilities? If so, why?

A2. The  Air  Force  experimented  with  recovering  full  costs  from  users  during  1969
to  1972  but  found  the  policy  to  be  detrimental  to  their  facilities,  causing  unstable
and  unpredictable  pricing  and  resulting  in  significant  drops  in  usage  despite  need.
NASA  has  recently  required  full-cost  recovery  of  full  operating  costs  from  the
users  of  its  aeronautical  test  facilities.  The  DOD  tried  a  similar  approach  long  ago,
but  it  rather  quickly  went  back  to  an  approach  that  established  a  budget  line  to
provide  funding  for  its  test  facilities,  with  users  just  being  charged  for  the  costs  of
their tests.

Conceptually,  setting  test  prices  to  cover  all  costs  is  not  recommended  because  it
can  discourage  use  and  endanger  strategic  facilities.  This  approach  does  give  users
more  information  about  the  full  costs  for  conducting  their  tests  at  a  facility.  If  this
cost  is  too  high,  users  can  respond  by  seeking  an  alternative  source  of  services  if
it  is  available;  alternatively,  users  may  avoid  important  testing  or  test  in  inferior
facilities and obtain degraded or even misleading data. The approach would lead to
good outcomes if the alternative facilities are a better value over the long term and
strategically important resources are retained. Unfortunately, this approach leads to
poor outcomes if a facility is a better long-term value but low near-term utilizations
and resulting higher near-term prices mask the long-term value of the facility. The
approach is also bad when the remaining users cannot afford the costs to keep open
strategic facilities needed in the long-term.

When  the  Air  Force  experimented  with  recovering  full  costs  from  1969  to  1972,
AEDC  found  that  their  prices  became  inherently  unstable  and  unpredictable  be-
cause  large  infrastructure-driven  costs  had  to  be  spread  over  an  annually  variable
customer  workload  base.7 Also,  test  customers  were  not  given  time  to  adjust  their
budgets  to  accommodate  increases  in  testing  prices.  As  a  result,  the  test  workload
decreased  dramatically  (see  the  ‘‘Industrial  Funding’’  era  in  Figure  1  below).  This,
in  turn,  drove  up  overhead  costs  and  initiated  a  positive  feedback  loop  that  contin-
ued  driving  up  prices  and  driving  away  users.  AEDC  found  that  testing  decisions
were being made based on near-term cost considerations rather than strategic consid-
erations  to  reduce  long-term  program  risks  through  testing.  The  resulting  reduced
testing  loads  and  reduced  income  caused  significant  detrimental  effects  on  AEDC’s
facilities, including the loss of skilled people, loss of independent analysis and eval-
uation capabilities, decreased investments for the future, and reduced facility readi-
ness through the loss of maintenance resources.

The financial collapse at AEDC was only halted when shared support through di-
rect  budget  authority  was  restored  to  AEDC.  Combined  with  the  need  to  better  ac-
count  for  the  full  costs  of  test  facilities,  the  DOD  established  the  Major  Range  and
Test  Facilities  Base  (MRTFB)  and  advocated  that  users  need  to  see  the  cost  they
impose  on  a  facility  while  not  being  asked  to  pay  for  unused  and  underutilized  ca-
pacity  at  strategically  important  test  facilities  they  use.  Since  1972  (when  direct
budget  authority  was  reinstated  at  AEDC),  reimbursements  consistently  paid  for

it vital to provide shared support for its facilities despite fiscal pressures in various
eras.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Mike  J.  Benzakein,  Chairman,  Department  of  Aerospace  Engineering,

Ohio State University

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. If  the  budget  for  aeronautics  is  limited,  is  it  more  important  for  NASA  to  fund
long-term, high-risk research or to continue with incremental subsonic research?
Should improving air traffic control be the top priority for NASA’s research pro-
gram?

A1. The NASA aeronautics expenditures need to maintain a balance between short-
and long-term research. It is also important for NASA to explore new ideas and con-
cepts  that  might  come  to  fruition  in  20  to  50  years.  It  is  important  for  NASA  to
address  the  needs  of  commercial  aviation  and  the  flying  public.  This  requires  tech-
nologies that need to be available five to ten years from now to permit cleaner, safer
and  more  efficient  travel.  It  is  also  essential  for  the  Nation  to  maintain  its  pre-
eminence in commercial aviation, a position which is coming under competitive pres-
sure from Europe.

Improving  air  traffic  control  should  be  a  high  priority  for  NASA’s  research  pro-
gram.  It  is  needed  as  we  move  forward,  and  the  air  traffic  volume  is  growing.  It
should be one of the top priorities at NASA in conjunction with subsonic and super-
sonic  research,  hypersonics,  rotorcraft,  and  aviation  safety  and  security.  The  rec-
ommendations  for  a  NASA  Aeronautics  Program  have  been  submitted  in  a  report
to the United States Congress in April of this year by the National Institute of Aero-
space.  This  report  summarizes  the  work  performed  by  a  team  of  250  scientists  and
engineers  from  industry  and  academia  who  have  worked  intensely  to  define  the
needs of the Nation.
Q2. How  high  a  priority  should  research  on  hypersonics  be?  If  NASA  aeronautics
were  fat  funded  in  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  06,  that  is,  given  $54  million  more  than
the President has proposed, where would you put that money?

A2. Hypersonics  is  on  NASA’s  list  of  priorities.  It  needs  to  be  addressed.  It  comes
however,  after  subsonic  and  supersonic  research,  and  air  traffic  control.  I  see  the
first application of hypersonics to be military. So DOD should take the lead in fund-
ing that research. If $54 million in additional funding became available, I would put
those dollars in subsonic and supersonic airframe and propulsion research.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. Some have argued that aviation is a mature industry and thus the Federal Gov-
ernment  should  no  longer  invest  in  aeronautics  R&D.  Do  you  agree  or  disagree
with that conclusion?

A1. Is  aviation  a  mature  industry?  It  depends  on  how  you  define  ‘‘mature’’;  if  you
mean ‘‘experienced,’’ yes it is. We have come a long way over the last 50 years. Tre-
mendous progress has been made in every facet of aeronautics both in the commer-
cial and military fields. Does this mean that further major breakthrough technology
developments  are  not  in  the  cards?  The  answer  is  a  resounding  NO!  Significant
progress is required in every aspect of aeronautics. Let me just list a few areas.

1. Air traffic Management
2. Safety
3. Noise
4. Pollution Control
5. Fuel Burn
6. Maintainability

Every  forecasting  indicates  that  the  world  will  be  adding  over  20,000  commercial
airplanes  to  the  system  by  the  year  2020.  We  are  close  to  gridlock  today.  To  avoid
long  delays  and  jeopardizing  the  safety  and  convenience  of  the  flying  public,  we
need to have a better, more efficient airspace system.

Noise is getting to be a barrier to growing airports and improvements are needed
in  the  aircraft  and  engine  design.  The  same  goes  for  Aircraft  emissions  which  are
growing  significantly  as  air  traffic  grows.  They  require  further  research  in  clean
combustion  systems.  We  need  more  fuel  efficient  engines  to  reduce  CO2 and  its
threat to Global Warming. This is just for subsonic airplanes. When we go to super-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:40 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 020007 PO 00000 Frm 00153 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA05\031605\20007 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

150

sonic airplanes, we have not even scratched the surface. Beyond the noise and emis-
sion  challenges,  flying  at  supersonic  speeds  for  sustained  periods  of  time  brings  up
the need for a plethora of technologies that are yet to be developed. The challenges
are similar to the one faced in the military world when one goes to the Long Range
Strike  Fighter  and  other  applications.  The  Hypersonic  World  is  also  out  there  and
this is just the beginning.

So  there  is  a  lot  to  be  done  in  the  ‘‘mature’’  industry.  There  is  a  lot  to  be  done
also on the education side to ensure that we properly train the work force, the engi-
neers,  and  the  scientists  in  the  U.S.  so  they  can  face  these  technology  challenges.
So the need is there. Should the Federal Government invest in Aeronautics R&D?
The  answer  is  YES.  The  question  is  often  asked:  Why  does  not  the  industry  pick
up the effort? The answer is that the industry is geared to perform the development
of  new  products.  This  investment  is  large  (10  fold  the  amount  of  R&D  effort  de-
scribed  above).  The  industry  is  focused  on  products  it  wants  to  bring  to  market  in
the  next  five  to  10  years.  The  Federal  Government  needs  to  invest  in  technologies
that will be needed in 10 to 20 years. It needs to evaluate a number of technologies,
do  the  screening  so  that  the  industry  could  pick  up  the  winners  and  develop  them
into  products.  In  summary,  I  believe  that  Aviation  has  made  tremendous  progress
over  the  last  50  years.  There  is  a  lot  yet  to  be  done  and  the  Federal  Government
has a key role to play in Aeronautics R&D.
Q2. In  2001  the  European  Commission  announced  a  multi-year  initiative  in  aero-
nautics with ambitious goals. To quote the ‘‘Vision 2020’’ report, the goal of that
initiative is that: ‘‘In 2020, European aeronautics is the world’s number one. Its
companies  are  celebrated  brands,  renowned  for  the  quality  of  products  that  are
wining  more  than  50  percent  shares  of  world  markets  for  aircraft,  engines,  and
equipment. . .  The  public  sector  plays  an  invaluable  role  in  this  success
story. . .  Crucially  [European  governments]  are  coordinating  a  highly  effective
European  framework  for  research  cooperation,  while  finding  programs  that  put
the industry on more equal terms with its main rivals.’’

Q2a. How seriously do you take the European Initiative in aeronautics R&D?
Q2b. Do you believe that the NASA aeronautics budget request for FY06 and the out-

years is a sufficient response to the European Initiative?

A2a,b. In  the  last  month,  I  have  been  to  Europe  twice  to  visit  European  industry
and  European  universities.  I  can  assure  you  that  the  European  initiative  in  aero-
nautics  R&D  is  serious,  very  serious  indeed.  They  have  a  detailed  plan  outlining
their  goals,  the  technology  barriers  as  well  as  the  research  programs  they  need.
These  programs  are  funded  and  on  their  way.  There  is  an  excellent  collaboration
between  industry,  academics  and  European  governments.  The  programs  are  led  by
the  industry.  They  are  focused  and  results  oriented.  I  believe  that  the  EU  commu-
nity has put in place the elements of a program to give them the leadership in aero-
nautics in the next decade.

I do not believe that the NASA Aeronautics Budget request for FY06 and the out-
years represents an adequate response to the European Initiative. It does not come
close  to  facing  the  needs  of  the  Nation  in  Aeronautics.  As  I  mentioned  in  my  testi-
mony, I believe that aeronautics needs a national vision and an agenda to move for-
ward. I believe that its vision and strategy must be developed in partnership by in-
dustry, academia, and the Federal Government. As related in my testimony, the Na-
tional Institute of Aerospace, at Congress’ request, has chartered a task team of sci-
entists and engineers to examine the subject and define some specific recommenda-
tions. This work has been completed and is summarized in a report that was deliv-
ered  to  the  Chair  and  Ranking  Member  of  both  Appropriation  Subcommittees  last
week  .  I  believe  that  the  type  of  effort  outlined  in  this  report  is  what  is  required
in the next five years to address the aforementioned European Initiative.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by R. John Hansman, Jr., Director, International Center for Air Transpor-

tation, MIT

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. ‘‘If  the  budget  for  aeronautics  is  limited,  is  more  important  for  NASA  to  fund
long-term, high-risk research or to continue with incremental subsonic research?
Should improving air traffic control be the top priority for NASA’s research pro-
gram?’’

NASA  should  have  a  balanced  portfolio  of  near  and  long  term  focused  research.
As  with  any  portfolio  the  long-term  research  can  and  should  be  higher  risk  with
high future payoff while the near-term research is focused on well identified needs.
I  would  point  out  that  many  of  the  high  payoff  areas  are  likely  to  be  in  subsonic
vehicles which will always constitute the vast majority of our aircraft. Breakthrough
technologies which enable more efficient, cleaner, safer and more accessible aircraft
operations would have enormous benefit.

Air  traffic  control  is  clearly  an  area  of  urgent  national  attention.  NASA  has  an
important  role  in  the  national  strategy  to  improve  air  traffic  control  and  has  been
a strong member of the JPDO. Consequently, air traffic control should be one of the
key  priorities  at  NASA  but  this  should  not  be  to  the  exclusion  of  air  vehicle  or  air
safety research.
Q2. ‘‘How  high  a  priority  should  research  on  hypersonics  be?  If  NASA  aeronautics
were  flat  funded  in  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  06,  that  is,  given  $54  million  more  than
the President has proposed, where would you put that money?’’

A2. Hypersonics  research  is  in  the  long-term,  high-risk  category  where  the  impact
would  most  likely  to  be  in  military  or  space  applications.  I  believe  that  it  is  wise
to  have  some  capability  in  hypersonics  but  for  civil  aeronautics  would  put  this  at
a lower priority than other areas.

Given  the  modest  increase  over  the  President’s  proposed  aeronautics  budget,  I
would  invest  part  in  improved  engine  efficiency  research  which  will  have  strong  le-
verage  in  fuel  and  environmental  benefits.  Given  the  emergent  fuel  shortages  I
would  also  look  for  opportunities  for  NASA  research  to  have  spinoff  applications  to
automobiles and other vehicles. I would also invest in a program of small scale (sin-
gle  investigator)  aeronautics  innovation  grants  to  stimulate  new  ideas  and  enthu-
siasm across a range of technologies.

Question submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. ‘‘Some  have  argued  that  aviation  is  a  mature  industry  and  thus  the  Federal
Government  should  not  longer  invest  in  aeronautics  R&D.  Do  you  agree  or  dis-
agree with that conclusion?’’

A1. I disagree with both the premise and the conclusion.

Aviation continues to be a dynamic and evolving industry. There are rich and ex-
citing  opportunities  for  vehicle  systems  driven  by  potential  advances  in  propulsion,
information technology, materials, micro technologies, complex systems engineering,
aerodynamics,  navigation,  human-machine  integration  and  many  other  areas.  We
can expect new vehicle configurations new operating paradigms and new industries
to emerge if we maintain a healthy aviation industry.

The  aviation  industry  will  also  need  to  grow  to  a  new  level  of  maturity  to  meet
the  challenges  of  the  future.  For  example,  increasing  fuel  prices  will  drive  a  new
round  of  technical  development  to  improve  fuel  efficiency.  Aviation  based  innova-
tions will have impact and applications in other vehicle classes such as automobiles.
Environmental  considerations  will  also  stimulate  innovation  and  the  need  for  a
deeper  understanding  of  approaches  to  minimize  environmental  impact.  Low  emis-
sion and functionally silent aircraft are real possibilities. The increased demand and
reliance for air transportation services coupled with airport and roadway congestion
will  drive  the  need  for  new  classes  of  vehicles  and  new  operating  paradigms  to  im-
prove the safety, efficiency and capacity of aviation.

These are only a few of the obvious applications. In all likelihood, the most excit-
ing opportunities are yet to be discovered. I hope that we can create an environment
where our students have the skills, motivation and environment to create them.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN W. DOUGLASS
PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA

Introduction

Chairman  Calvert,  on  behalf  of  the  Aerospace  Industries  Association  of  America,
or  AIA,  I  wish  to  thank  you,  Representative  Udall,  and  Members  of  the  Space  and
Aeronautics Subcommittee for the opportunity to testify on the enduring connection
between aeronautics research and American national interests. AIA represents more
than 100 regular and 170 associate member companies, and we operate as the larg-
est aerospace manufacturing trade association in the United States. With more than
607,000  engineering  and  production  workers,  we  also  have  a  long  history  in  the
management of aeronautics issues.

I  will  begin  with  a  summary  of  both  the  strategic  benefits  and  the  resource  defi-
ciencies  in  the  aeronautics  programs  of  NASA.  After  this  overview,  I  will  discuss
two  key  policy  challenges  in  the  aeronautics  arena:  the  need  for  equity  in  the  sup-
port  of  mid-term  and  breakthrough  aviation  technologies  and  the  critical  project  of
air  traffic  management  modernization.  My  testimony  will  then  turn  to  an  assess-
ment  of  the  aggressive  aeronautics  programs  of  America’s  main  civil  aviation  com-
petitor  abroad:  the  European  Union.  Finally,  I  will  close  with  a  few  suggestions  on
the focus of a potential United States Aeronautics Policy.
The National Value of Aeronautics Investment

The  November  2002  bipartisan  report  of  The  Commission  on  the  Future  of  the
United  States  Aerospace  Industry  concluded  that  continued  public  investment  in
aeronautical  research  and  development  remained  vital  to  America’s  leadership  in
the  global  aviation  industry  (one  which  generated  a  $31  billion  trade  surplus  in
2004) as well as our national security. In cultivating new generations of safe, high-
performance  aircraft,  aeronautics  programs  strengthen  the  country’s  commercial
and military power by stimulating innovations in:

• information technology;
• air traffic management;
• climate and terrain analysis;
• aerial navigation and surveillance;
• clean energy sources;
• new materials;
• advanced technologies for design and manufacturing development; and
• aircraft noise and emissions control.

Aeronautics  research  subsequently  reduces  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  a  glob-
ally-integrated economy while supporting the Defense Department’s requirement for
forces that can deploy to any point on the planet or track our enemies from distant
command centers. Recent budget decisions, however, do not reflect the strategic im-
portance of aeronautics to the Nation.

During  the  last  two  decades,  NASA’s  budget  has  doubled  from  approximately
eight  billion  dollars  to  a  proposed  $16.5  billion  for  FY  2006.  In  contrast  to  this
steady  top  line  growth,  the  Agency’s  aeronautics  funding  has  declined  from  a  FY
1994  high  point  of  $1.5  billion  to  less  than  $853  million  today.  NASA  expenditures
already  claim  a  modest  0.7  percent  of  all  Federal  Government  spending,  with  aero-
nautics  receiving  only  six  percent  of  that  amount,  or  $717.6  million,  by  2010  if  the
current plan remains unchanged.

Complicating  these  trends,  NASA’s  transition  to  a  full  cost  accounting  system  in
FY03 significantly reduced direct aeronautics research spending by transferring ad-
ministrative  costs  previously  absorbed  in  the  Agency’s  headquarters  budget  to  each
one  of  the  mission  directorates  (please  refer  to  Appendix  A).  Even  before  the  adop-
tion  of  full  cost  accounting,  the  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate  (ARMD),
with  its  single-digit  share  of  the  budget,  employed  only  15  percent  of  Agency  per-
sonnel  yet  sustained  40  percent  of  the  Agency’s  facilities  and  infrastructure  and
therefore pays a disproportionate share of NASA’s administrative costs.

The ability of NASA to intensify the research and testing of advanced aeronautics
concepts—and  to  reduce  its  overhead—ultimately  depends  on  congressional  leader-
ship. AIA recommends, Mr. Chairman, that Congress restore NASA’s funding avail-
able  for  aeronautics  research  to  the  levels  seen  prior  to  the  2003  move  to  full  cost
accounting (please refer to Appendix B for historical aeronautics funding trends). In
doing so, Congress should instruct the Administration to report each year on efforts

to  ensure  that  full  cost  accounting  does  not  divert  a  disproportionate  share  of  re-
sources from research to administrative functions.

It  is  critical  that  Congress  also  direct  the  administration  to  provide  NASA  with
increases  without  jeopardizing  space  exploration  programs.  In  2004,  when  NASA
submitted its first four-year budget incorporating the Nation’s new Vision for Space
Exploration  (VSE),  officials  proposed  aeronautics  expenditures  of  $942  million  for
FY  2009.  Barely  one  year  later,  the  FY  2009  figure  now  stands  at  $727.6  million.
This  reversal  indicates  that  judgments  of  policy,  not  a  presumed  financial  trade-off
between aeronautics and exploration, underlie the decisions about NASA’s long-term
budget.  It  also  signals  that  the  Administration  has  yet  to  recognize  the  full  socio-
economic value of progress in aeronautics.
Striking  the  Right  Balance  Between  Near-Term  and  Breakthrough  Re-

search

An  expansion  of  aeronautics  research  capabilities,  Mr.  Chairman,  must  occur  for
NASA to continue the development of both mid-term and breakthrough aeronautics
and air transportation technologies.

NASA’s  FY  2006  proposal  responds  to  the  2004  recommendation  of  the  National
Research  Council  that  the  government  sponsor  basic  research  on  ‘‘high-risk,  high-
payoff’’  aviation  initiatives.  Towards  this  end,  NASA’s  Vehicle  Systems,  Airspace
Systems  and  Aviation  Safety  Programs  each  embrace  the  goal  of  tripling  aviation
system  capacity  and  reducing  passenger  travel  times  by  one-half  during  the  next
twenty years.

At  the  same  time,  NASA  continues  to  support  future  industry  needs.  Durable,
low-cost  composite  materials,  lower  fuel  consumption,  and  automated  safety  and
maintenance  monitors,  all  supported  in  their  initial  phases  by  government  aero-
nautics research, will become standard features of most jetliners by 2015.

But to enhance its industry support mission, the Agency should revitalize its tur-
bine development programs. AIA regrets that NASA recently had to cancel its Ultra
Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) work since this project centered directly on the
improvement of engine efficiency and the reduction of fuel burn. The Agency should
strongly  consider  the  restoration  of  UEET  since  our  successful  experience  in  the
1980s  with  its  predecessor,  Energy  Efficient  Engines,  demonstrates  industry’s  abil-
ity  to  turn  NASA’s  basic  turbine  research  into  working  technology  that  conserves
fuel and reduces emissions.

Administration  officials  have  paid  a  similar  lack  of  attention  to  rotorcraft  tech-
nology.  In  the  past  25  years,  the  United  States  has  developed  one  new  medium-lift
helicopter while Europe has deployed three. More importantly, the lack of a vigorous
NASA rotorcraft program means that the Nation continues to miss opportunities to
test vertical lift applications for new modes of public transportation.

NASA  must  therefore  plan  investments  in  aeronautics  technologies  intended  for
system-wide  transportation  improvements  while  working  with  industry  on  aircraft
innovations  driven  by  safety  and  market  factors.  The  current  budget  request  out-
lines  laudable  objectives  such  as  subsonic  noise  and  supersonic  boom  reduction  in
addition  to  the  testing  of  a  high-endurance  Unmanned  Aerial  Vehicle.  But  the  de-
cline  in  year-to-year  ARMD  budgets,  unless  reversed,  will  cripple  NASA’s  ability  to
conduct  basic  research  across  the  spectrum  of  aeronautics  and  confine  the  Agency’s
work  to  only  a  handful  of  projects  with  the  highest  levels  of  financial  and  oper-
ational risk.
Air Traffic Management Modernization: Keystone of Mobility, Security, and

Growth

Our  greatest  aeronautics  challenge  in  the  second  century  of  flight  centers  on  the
effort  to  modernize  the  National  Airspace  System.  American  commercial  aviation
stands  at  an  unprecedented  point  in  history.  Rising  fuel  prices,  Internet-generated
business,  foreign  trade,  the  September  11th  attacks  and  the  need  for  dramatically
improved airport security, have imposed new demands on an air transportation sys-
tem  designed  more  than  40  years  ago.  A  2004  report  by  the  FAA  revealed  that  in
the  next  20  years,  20  more  U.S.  airports  will  handle  at  least  500,000  arrivals  and
departures  on  an  annual  basis.  Furthermore,  aircraft  now  carry  27  percent  of  the
Nation’s imports and exports.

Delays,  however,  follow  insufficient  capacity,  and  lost  time  in  the  aviation  sector
means  lost  money.  In  1994,  81  percent  of  all  domestic  flights  took  off  on  time  yet
NASA  reported  that  delays  of  15  minutes  or  more  still  cost  the  aviation  industry
2.3  billion  dollars.  By  2000,  the  on-time  rate  had  deceased  to  72  percent,  and  the
Aerospace Commission estimated that the cost of delays to the entire economy could
exceed $30 billion each year.

Economic  and  national  security  factors  make  it  essential  that  the  FAA-led  Joint
Planning  and  Development  Office  (JPDO),  created  by  Public  Law  108–176,  succeed
in its mission of building the Next Generation Air Transportation System.

The  House  Science  Committee,  as  well  as  the  House  Transportation  and  Infra-
structure and the Senate Commerce Committees, have the charge of overseeing this
complex project. With several government organizations involved, Congress must re-
quire  interagency  cooperation  and  accountability,  particularly  between  NASA  and
the  Air  Force,  on  JPDO  technology  sharing  and  personnel  assignments.  AIA  urges
the  Administration  to  continue  in  proposing  clear  and  adequate  budgets  for  the
JPDO to reduce the risk of program delays.

NASA’s  budget  request  wisely  includes  a  $48  million  increase  in  Airspace  Sys-
tems—the Agency’s office that supports the development of ATM situational aware-
ness  tools—and  directs  $10  million  to  the  JPDO.  With  ongoing  support  from  Con-
gress  and  JPDO  agency  stakeholders,  AIA  believes  that  a  fully  transformed  air
transportation  system  will  become  operational  by  2025.  Our  public  safety,  mobility,
and world economic leadership demand nothing less.
The Role of Aeronautics in the International Community

Based  on  the  achievements  of  United  States  aerospace  companies,  the  European
Union  (EU)  and  other  foreign  governments  continue  to  develop  aeronautics  pro-
grams  to  build  global  economic  and  technological  capabilities  and  to  challenge  the
U.S. for leadership in the industry.

In January 2001, the European Commission approved the plan entitled European
Aeronautics:  A  Vision  for  2020.  This  document  adopts  the  multilateral  objective  of
‘‘a  world-class  European  aeronautics  industry  that  leads  in  global  markets  for  air-
craft  and  engines.’’  EU  officials  take  an  integrated,  strategic  view  of  aerospace  and
aeronautics.  Vision  2020  notes  that  trade,  investment,  tourism,  and  political  ties  to
emerging  markets  all  depend  on  a  vibrant  air  transportation  industry.  The  Euro-
peans also have a clear sense of the business issues at stake; their plan states that
‘‘without European aeronautics, air travel would be almost completely dominated by
U.S. aircraft.’’

Vision  2020  declares  that  the  time  and  expense  associated  with  airliner  develop-
ment  goes  ‘‘beyond  the  reach  of  one  company  and  of  the  budgets  of  most  single  na-
tions.’’  As  a  result  of  this  assessment,  European  leaders  announced  in  March  2002
the  goal  of  increasing  total  R&D  spending  to  three  percent  of  European  GDP  by
2010, with the aeronautics share claiming $2.6 billion. Fourteen years ago, the EU’s
aeronautics budget amounted to just $45 million.

NASA’s  current  budget  submission  moves  in  the  opposite  direction  of  the  Euro-
peans,  with  cuts  in  aeronautics  programs  of  almost  25  percent  over  the  next  four
fiscal years even though the Agency focuses on vital public interest research: initia-
tives  that  make  air  travel  more  quiet,  secure,  and  reliable.  EU  companies  and  gov-
ernments, unlike NASA, restrict international access to their aviation R&D and con-
centrate heavily on product-specific improvements to expand civil market share. The
spending commitments of the EU, however, should remind us of the enduring public
benefits of aeronautics—from safe forms of transportation to the expansion of export
industries—and the corresponding need for Congress and the Administration to ade-
quately fund government-wide aeronautics activities.
Conclusion: Envisioning a United States Aeronautics Policy

As  it  prepares  to  consider  the  FY  2006  NASA  Authorization  Bill,  Congress  has
a  unique  opportunity  to  frame  a  national  aeronautics  policy  to  guide  the  aviation
investment and reform strategies of the Federal Government. The policy should con-
firm  the  multi-dimensional  benefits  of  aeronautics  research  to  the  United  States  in
this age of the information economy and expanding military air power. Future fleets
of  secure  and  efficient  aircraft,  enabled  by  new  technologies,  will  stimulate  higher
volumes of travel and investment, as well as capital and cargo flows, in an aviation
sector  that  already  accounts  for  about  11  million  American  jobs.  Furthermore,  the
JPDO,  by  relying  on  aeronautics  communications  technologies,  has  the  challenge  of
improving the speed and precision of airborne operations for civil and military users
alike.

For these reasons, a United States Aeronautics Policy would yield long-term bene-
fits  to  the  Nation  and  should  instruct  the  appropriate  government  agencies  to  de-
velop  comprehensive  strategies  for  high  risk,  basic  aviation  research  as  well  as  en-
ergy,  environmental,  and  navigational  programs  to  support  air  vehicles  in  develop-
ment. We believe that the policy, to ensure interagency coordination, should also re-
quire  NASA,  FAA,  and  the  Defense  Department  to  hold  regular  joint  meetings  on
their common aeronautics research objectives.

The Nation would be strengthened by such a policy since the instruments of aero-
nautics improve some of the basic elements that define American security and pros-
perity  in  the  early  21st  Century:  cost-effective  mobility  over  vast  distances;  geo-
graphical  analysis  for  a  safe  landing  or  enemy  surveillance;  and  an  expanded  air
systems capacity for our growing international trade commitments.

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  permitting  AIA  to  submit  these  views  for  the

record of the Subcommittee’s hearing.

AERONAUTICS TEST PROGRAM (ATP)

WHITE PAPER

INTRODUCTION

The  NASA  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate  (ARMD)  proposes  to  start
the  Aeronautics  Test  Program  (ATP),  funded  at  $26M  in  FY06  and  increasing  to
$31.4M  by  FY11.  The  purpose  of  the  ATP  is  to  ensure  the  strategic  availability  of
a minimum, critical suite of wind tunnels/ground test facilities which are necessary
to meet Mission Directorate, Agency and National needs and requirements. In addi-
tion, the ATP will be responsible for the strategic and business management of the
aeronautics wind tunnels/ground test facilities at Ames Research Center, Glenn Re-
search Center and Langley Research Center. It will be the responsibility of the ATP
Manager  to  ensure  funding  so  as  to  provide  the  appropriate  levels  of  maintenance
and  investments  in  the  ATP  suite  of  facilities.  The  scope  of  the  ATP  is  limited  to
the management of large aeronautics ground test facilities including subsonic, tran-
sonic, supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnels, propulsion wind tunnels and jet en-
gine test cells.
BACKGROUND

There  have  been  13  major  wind  tunnel/facility  studies  performed  during  the  past
15  years  (see  Appendix  A),  which  have  addressed  the  many  issues  surrounding  the
Nation’s  major  aeronautical  ground  based  test  facilities.  These  studies  were  per-
formed  mostly  at  the  behest  of  decision-makers  within  the  senior  management  of
various  government  organizations  due  to  insufficient  data  being  available  which
would  justify  the  level  of  testing  infrastructure  being  maintained  by  the  U.S.  Gov-
ernment and in the Nation. In general, many of these studies came to the same con-
clusion,  wherein  they  recognized  the  importance  of  aeronautical  ground  based  test
facilities,  wind  tunnels  and  air  breathing  propulsion  test  facilities,  to  the  future  of
this country’s aeronautical industry and national security.

The  RAND  Study,  which  is  the  last  of  the  13  studies  listed  in  the  Appendix,  is
also  described  in  more  detail  in  a  later  section.  In  implementing  the  Aeronautics
Test  Program,  the  ARMD  has  sought  to  appropriately  respond  to  a  common  thread
from many of these studies, including the RAND study. In recognition of the impor-
tance of NASA ground test facilities to the Nation’s economic future and to national
security,  many  of  these  studies  challenged  NASA  to  sustain  key  parts  its  existing
test capabilities and capacity. The ATP is being structured to accomplish that goal.
AERONAUITCS TEST PROGRAM STRUCTURE (WHAT IS FUNDED?)

Five categories of facilities have been established under which the facilities in the
ATP  suite  have  been  placed.  Broadly,  these  categories  relate  to  the  utilization  and
agency/national  importance  of  the  facilities.  An  explanation  of  the  five  categories
along with the identification of the facilities within each category is as follows:

Category I. Facilities for which substantial ARMD program usage is forecast and/
or  facilities  for  which  ARMD  is  proposing  to  assume  a  national  stewardship  role.
The  intent  with  respect  to  Category  I  facilities  is  to  provide  a  high  level  of  con-
fidence to internal and external users that a Category I Facility will be in operation
and available for the foreseeable future. The Category 1 facilities are the:

• Ames Unitary Wind Tunnel
• Glenn Icing Research Tunnel
• Glenn 9 × 15 Subsonic Tunnel
• Langley National Transonic Tunnel

Category II. Facilities that NASA (other than ARMD), DOD, and industry require
now or may require in the future to carry out research and for developing vehicles.
ARMD  makes  a  two  year  commitment  to  facilities  placed  in  this  category,  in  order
to  properly  assess  the  current  environment  and  to  not  make  unilateral  decisions
that would adversely effect other mission directorates, the DOD, or the Nation. The
Category 2 facilities are the:

• Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel
• Langley Hypersonics Complex
• Langley 20–Foot Vertical Spin Tunnel
• Glenn Propulsion Systems Lab 3 & 4
• Langley 14 × 22 Subsonic Tunnel
• Glenn 10 × 10 Supersonic Tunnel
• Langley 8–Foot High Temperature Tunnel

161

Category  III.  Facilities  that  are  currently  not  required  but  are  viewed  as  part  of

a robust ground test capability. The Category III facilities are the:

• Glenn Hypersonic Test Facility
• Ames 12–Foot Pressure Tunnel

Category  IV.  Facilities  that  are  not  utilized  and/or  not  viewed  as  components  of

a future ground test capability. The Category IV facilities are the:

• Langley 16–Foot Transonic Tunnel
• Ames National Full-Scale Aerodynamic Complex
• Ames 7 × 10 Subsonic Tunnels #1 and #2
• Langley 22–inch Mach 20 Tunnel
• Langley Low Turbulence Pressure Tunnel
• Langley Unitary Supersonic Tunnel

Category  V.  Facilities  that  are  defined  as  laboratories  and  as  such  are  not  rec-
ommended  for  inclusion  in  the  ATP.  These  facilities  are  to  be  maintained  by  the
Field Centers. Category V facilities are the:

• Glenn Aero-Acoustic Propulsion Laboratory
• Langley 0.3–meter Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel
• Langley Jet Exit Facility
• Langley 20–inch Supersonic Wind Tunnel

All categorization decisions and investment decisions will be revisited annually as
part  of  the  budget  cycle.  The  operations  of  the  facilities  in  Categories  I,  II,  and  III
above  in  their  levels  of  readiness  is  funded  at  $18.4M  in  FY06.  Other  activities  in
the ATP include prioritized maintenance of the Category I and II facilities at $4.3M,
facility  upgrades  and  test  technology  development  funded  at  $1.0M,  program  office
expenses at $1.3M and a university research component which will solicit work from
university  principle  investigators  and  will  require  the  use  of  the  ATP  facilities  to
accomplish  proposed  research  goals,  funded  at  $1.0M.  The  ATP  is  summarized  in
Figure 1.

The  Aeronautics  Test  Program  is  being  setup  under  the  umbrella  of  the
Foundational Technology Program. The Foundational Technology Program’s purpose
is  twofold.  The  first  is  to  fund  basic  and  applied  research  in  order  to  develop  the
technological  foundation  for  the  next  wave  of  aeronautics  barrier  breaking  tech-
nology  demonstration  programs.  The  second  is  to  sustain  the  core  competencies  at
the  NASA  Research  Centers  that  are  required  to  implement  the  current  research
program  and  the  next  wave  of  research  programs.  In  addition  to  the  ATP,  the
Foundational  Technology  Program  also  includes  University  Research  Project.  The
University Research Project will provide funding for the same basic and applied re-
search activities as described above, but with the stipulation that all available fund-
ing  be  performed  in  academia,  so  as  to  ensure  that  the  ARMD  avails  itself  of  the
widest  possible  range  of  research  ideas  and  activities.  This  project  is  to  be  funded
at  one  percent  of  the  ‘‘after  tax’’  (after  ensuring  that  corporate  and  mission  direc-
torate  general  and  administrative  costs  have  been  covered)  Aeronautics  Research
Mission Directorate available budget guideline.
THE RAND STUDY

In  November  2004,  the  RAND  Corporation’s  National  Defense  Research  Institute
concluded  an  in-depth  examination  of  the  Nation’s  wind  tunnel  and  air-breathing
propulsion  testing  needs  and  the  issues  surrounding  NASA’s  role  in  meeting  those
needs. The final report, entitled, ‘‘Wind Tunnels and Propulsion Test Facilities—An
Assessment  of  NASA’s  Capabilities  to  Serve  National  Needs,’’  was  released  in  Feb-
ruary  2005.  At  the  highest  level,  the  RAND  Study  concluded  that  despite  aero-
nautics  maturity,  that  test  facilities  are  still  critical.  Specifically,  RAND  concluded
that:

research and production in U.S. aeronautics

• Many facilities operate at less than full capacity
• Utilization is not the overriding metric for determining a facility’s value
• Establishing and supporting a minimum set of important facilities can ensure
• National consolidation and coordination of test facility investments is the next

challenge.

The study recommended that NASA should:

• Develop a long-term, funded aeronautic test facilities vision and plan
• Use shared funding of annual full costs
• Maintain and invest in minimum set of NASA facilities
• Continue  efforts  to  adopt  consistent  management  processes  and  procedures
• Make sure near-term decisions (e.g., to mothball or close facilities) have finan-

cial gains relative to the long-term capability risks

tion.

In  general,  NASA  concurs,  and  is  taking  steps  to  implement  these  recommenda-
tions. First and foremost, NASA is changing our approach to the strategic manage-
ment of these important capabilities by implementation of the ATP. During the past
several  decades,  decisions  regarding  the  operation  and  closure  of  specific  facilities
were made primarily by the NASA Center that operated each facility, based on the
assumption that the Center was in the best position to assess customer demand, or
lack  thereof,  for  any  given  facility.  More  recently,  the  nature  and  pace  of  changes
within  and  beyond  the  Agency  have  made  it  increasingly  difficult  for  the  Centers
to manage and operate such facilities—particularly those with large fixed costs and
uncertain levels of utilization. There has been a growing concern that Centers were
being  forced  to  make  investment  (and  potentially,  divestment)  decisions  that  were
suboptimal with respect to overall Agency direction and interests.

Thirty-one  NASA  ground  test  facilities  were  assessed  within  the  scope  of  the
RAND  study.  Of  those  31,  twenty-nine  were  considered  be  the  ‘‘minimum  set’’  that
should  be  retained  by  NASA  in  order  to  serve  the  Nation’s  interests  in  aeronautics
research  and  development  and  product  test  and  evaluation.  Furthermore,  of  those
29,  nine  were  identified  were  identified  as  being,  ‘‘especially  detrimental  to  close.’’
This is because no alternatives to these nine facilities exist within the U.S., regard-
less of the cost. Figure 2 shows the 31 RAND facilities with both the ‘‘minimum set’’
of  29  and  the  ‘‘detrimental  to  close’’  subset  of  9.  The  figure  also  identifies  the  rela-
tionship between the RAND study facilities and the ATP suite of facilities.
FACILITY COSTS EXPLANATION

The  implementation  of  the  ATP  by  the  NASA  ARMD,  is  meant  to  stabilize  the
current environment that NASA finds itself in as the NASA Aeronautics R&D budg-
ets continue to decline and as the Agency continues to implement full-cost account-
ing and management. The less than 100 percent utilization in nearly all of NASA’s
large  ground  test  facilities  has  created  a  situation  wherein  the  NASA  Aeronautics
Research Programs are being required to pay facility fixed costs even if the utiliza-
tion  of  a  given  facility  is  less  than  (and  in  some  cases  well  less  than)  100  percent
of  the  calendar  year.  In  the  many  cases  where  the  fixed  costs  include  full  staffing
of  the  facility,  these  costs  being  borne  by  the  program  are  substantial  and  have  a
measurable  effect  on  the  available  procurement  dollars  to  the  aeronautics  research
programs.  The  ATP  attempts  to  pay  for  a  large  percentage  of  the  fixed  costs  of  its
Category I facilities. For the Category II facilities, the ATP will encourage cost sav-
ings  by  staffing  and  operating  these  facilities  only  when  in  use  and  by  placing  the
facilities  in  stand-by  during  non-use  time  periods.  Category  III  facilities,  for  which
there  is  no  projected  usage,  will  be  mothballed  starting  in  FY06,  and  the  only  in-
curred  costs  will  be  those  associated  with  activities  required  to  place  the  facility  in
mothball status. Should a customer have a need for a Category III facility, that cus-
tomer will be expected to bear all costs of bringing the facility back to active status,
of facility operations, and of returning the facility to it’s mothballed state. There are
no  incurred  costs  at  the  ATP  level  for  Category  IV  and  V  facilities,  which  are  to
be either closed or maintained locally, respectively.

As  calculated  by  RAND  in  doing  their  previously  described  study,  the  annual  op-
erating  cost  of  the  31  facilities  that  they  assessed  was  $125M  to  $130M,  annually,
in FY03 dollars. The ATP funding as mentioned previously is funded at $26M start-
ing in FY06. The breakdown of that funding is summarized in Figure 1. Definitions
as noted below are for explanatory purposes.

2. Fixed  Operating  Cost—This  is  cost  incurred  in  order  to  keep  a  facility  open
and  ready  for  business,  but  does  not  include  the  cost  of  test  operations,  per
se.

3. Personnel  Cost:  Civil  Servant  and  Contractor—These  costs  attempt  to  cap-
ture  the  direct  and  indirect  personnel  associated  with  facility  and  test  oper-
ations.

4. Mothball-to-Operational Costs—Mothball costs are generally only those costs
required to ensure facility safety. Since minimal investment is required, both
the  time  and  costs  associated  with  moving  a  facility  from  mothball  to  active
status  can  be  substantial,  depending  upon  the  complexity  of  the  system.
Typically  reactivation  times  are  order-of  magnitude-wise  measured  in
months.

5. Standby-to-Operational Costs—A facility maintained in stand-by condition is
one  whose  subsystems  (electrical,  mechanical,  facility  control,  and  data)  are
regularly  maintained,  or  even  exercised.  As  such,  a  small  level  of  staffing  is
required  while  a  facility  in  stand-by.  The  level  of  activity  is  less  than  would
be  incurred  as  part  of  the  fixed  costs  associated  with  an  active  facility.  The
level  of  effort  to  bring  the  facility  from  stand-by  to  active  status  is  order-of-
magnitude wise measured in weeks.

OTHER (PAST) MAJOR FACILITY/WIND TUNNEL STUDIES

The major studies are listed below with a brief description of each along with im-

portant conclusions.

1. The  National  Facilities  Study,  April  29,  1994:  The  objectives  of  the  Study
were  to:  1)  determine  where  U.S.  facilities  do  not  meet  the  national  aero-
space  needs;  2)  define  new  facilities  required  to  make  U.S.  capabilities
world class; 3) define where consolidation and phase out of existing facilities
is  appropriate;  and  4)  develop  a  long-term  national  plan  for  world-class  fa-
cility acquisition and shared usage.

2. ‘‘Assessing The National Plan for Aeronautical Ground Test Facilities,’’ Na-
tional  Research  Council,  1994  reviewed  and  validated  the  National  Facili-
ties Study recommendations for new national test capability.

3. ‘‘Goals  For  A  National  Partnership  In  Aeronautics  Research  and  Tech-
nology,’’  National  Science  and  Technology  Council,  1995.  This  report  as-
sessed the status of the U.S. aeronautics research infrastructure.

4. Aeronautics  and  Astronautics  Coordinating  Board  Cooperation  Initiative,
May 1996, developed 34 recommendations including the recommendation to
create six NASA–DOD major facilities alliances to improve cross agency co-
ordination  and  to  develop  costs  savings  and  efficiencies.  The  alliances  cre-
ated were:
• National Wind Tunnel Alliance
• Air Breathing Propulsion Test Facilities Alliance
• National Rocket Propulsion Test Alliance
• Space environmental simulation facilities Alliance
• Arc Heated Test Facilities Alliance
• Hypervelocity Ballistic/Impact Range Testing Alliance
In addition this study noted that the U.S. Government had closed approxi-
mately  40  percent  of  its  major  wind  tunnels  and  air  breathing  propulsion
test facilities since 1993.

5. The  National  Wind  Tunnel  Complex  Project  Archive,  July  1996,  describes
a  major  new  state-of-the-art  subsonic/transonic  test  capability  that  would
have  replaced  several  existing  facilities  in  the  U.S.  This  complex  was  not
built because of financial considerations.

6. ‘‘DOD  Aeronautical  Test  Facilities  Assessment,’’  March  1997.  The  study
looked  at  DOD’s  future  aeronautical  development  program  needs  for  wind
tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics.

7. ‘‘Assessment  of  Asian  Wind  Tunnels,’’  Sverdrup  Technology,  Inc.,  June

1999.

8. The  National  Aeronautical  Test  Alliance  (NATA)  was  implemented  in  May
2000. This is a NASA/DOD alliance that was created to coordinate activities
between  NASA  and  DOD  thus  moving  toward  a  more  national  view  point
for wind tunnels.

9. National  Wind  Tunnel  Strategic  Plan—Report  on  912c  Wind  Tunnel  Study
by  DOD  Test  Environments  Reliance  Panel  and  NASA,  September  2000.
This study reviewed previous wind tunnel studies and provided conclusions
from those studies.

10. ‘‘Competitive Assessment of the U.S. Large Civil Aircraft Aerostructural In-
dustry,’’ U.S. International Trade Commission Publication 3433, June 2001.
Part of the study addresses the importance of the supporting infrastructure
to the aircraft industry.

11. Final  Report  of  the  Commission  of  the  Future  of  the  United  States  Aero-
space  Industry,  November  2002.  This  report  noted  that  the  aerospace  re-
search infrastructure is aging and that the U.S. needs to make investments
in  this  infrastructure  to  successfully  carryout  this  country’s  research  pro-
grams.

12. ‘‘Securing  the  Future  of  U.S.  Air  Transportation—A  System  in  Peril,’’  Na-
tional  Research  Council,  2003.  This  report  does  not  directly  address  the
aerospace  research  infrastructure  but  does  describe  the  expected  directions

of air systems development and hence provides a basis for planning the ex-
perimental requirements for the future.

13. ‘‘Wind  Tunnel  and  Propulsion  Test  Facilities—An  Assessment  of  NASA’s
Capabilities  to  Serve  National  Needs,’’  RAND,  National  Defense  Research
Institute, 2004. Reviewed this country’s wind tunnels and air breathing pro-
pulsion  test  facilities,  and  made  a  recommendation  of  which  facilities  they
considered as important to this country’s future.
