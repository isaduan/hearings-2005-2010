U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

ATSDR: Problems in the Past,

Potential for the Future?

THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 2009

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

Chairman  Brad  Miller  of  the  Investigations  and  Oversight  Subcommittee  of  the
House  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  will  convene  a  hearing  at  10:00  a.m.
on Thursday, March 12, 2009, to examine the Agency for Toxic Substances and Dis-
ease  Registry’s  (ATSDR).  Last  year,  the  Subcommittee  held  a  hearing  and  issued
a staff report on how the Agency came to issue a scientifically flawed formaldehyde
health  consultation  for  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA).  The
flawed  report  and  ATSDR’s  botched  response  resulted  in  tens  of  thousands  of  sur-
vivors  of  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita  remaining  in  travel  trailers  laden  with  high
levels of formaldehyde for more than one year longer than necessary.

This hearing will consist of three panels and eight witnesses, including Dr. How-
ard Frumkin, Director of ATSDR. It will examine ongoing problems at ATSDR, spe-
cific cases where local community members, scientists and physicians are critical of
the Agency’s scientific methods, conclusions and lack of follow-up actions. The hear-
ing  will  also  hear  from  individuals  who  have  either  worked  for  or  with  the  Agency
in the past, including the former ATSDR ombudsman, who will provide their insight
into  the  cause  of  systematic  problems  at  the  Nation’s  public  health  agency  and  po-
tential remedies.

The  hearing  will  explore  why  ATSDR  has  refused  to  change  portions  of  a  health
report, described by the EPA as ‘‘questionable’’ and ‘‘misleading,’’ regarding asbestos
contamination  on  a  beach  on  Lake  Michigan  in  Chicago.  There  will  be  testimony
from  a  well-respected  medical  expert  on  a  rare  type  of  cancer  who  says  the  Agency
has refused to acknowledge a link between a cancer cluster in Pennsylvania and en-
vironmental contamination despite persuasive evidence.

In  addition,  a  British  scientist  will  describe  the  flawed  methods  ATSDR  used  to
investigate  depleted  uranium  exposures  among  residents  in  Colonie,  New  York  and
how he and colleagues succeeded in discovering depleted uranium exposures among
20  percent  of  the  resident  population  they  tested  there.  A  local  resident  from
Midlothian,  Texas,  known  as  the  cement  capital  of  the  world,  will  explain  how  and
why he and the local community have lost faith in ATSDR’s ability to independently
and  scientifically  investigate  the  health  problems  that  the  town’s  population,  par-
ticularly  its  children  and  animals,  have  been  suffering  from  that  they  believe  have
been caused by the one billion pounds of toxic emissions the town’s industries have
unleashed into the environment since 1990.

Chair MILLER. This hearing will now come to order.
Good  morning  and  welcome  to  today’s  hearing.  The  title  is
ATSDR: Problems in the Past, Potential for the Future? The stated
mission  of  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry,
ATSDR, is to serve the public by using the best science, taking re-
sponsive  public  health  actions  and  providing  trusted  health  infor-
mation to prevent harmful exposures and disease-related exposures
to toxic substances.

The  relatively  obscure  Federal  Government  agency  first  came  to
this  subcommittee’s  attention  a  year  or  so  ago  as  a  result  of
ATSDR’s  health  assessment  for  formaldehyde  exposure  by  Katrina
and Rita victims living in FEMA trailers. Government at all levels
failed the victims of Katrina and Rita in many ways, but ATSDR’s
failure was perhaps the most unforgivable. ATSDR’s health assess-
ment  certainly  failed  any  test  of  scientific  rigor  but  ATSDR’s  fail-
ure  was  worse  than  just  jackleg  science.  ATSDR’s  failure  was  a
failure not just of the head but of the heart.

FEMA  requested  the  health  assessment  to  use  in  litigation  and
requested that the assessment assume an exposure of less than two
weeks, knowing that Katrina and Rita victims had already been ex-
posed  to  formaldehyde  fumes  for  more  than  a  year,  and  that  there
was no end in sight to their exposure. Stunningly, ATSDR obliged.
Their report gave FEMA just what FEMA asked for. Let me repeat
that to let it sink in. FEMA came to ATSDR and said we have been
sued,  we  need  a  health  assessment  for  exposure  to  formaldehyde
fumes. The folks that have been exposed to those fumes have been
exposed  for  more  than  a  year  already  and  God  only  knows  how
long  they  will  be  exposed  into  the  future  but  we  want  you  to  as-
sume they were exposed for less than two weeks, and ATSDR said
no  problem,  okay,  we  can  do  that.  Now,  obviously  I  have  had  to
shorten that story a little bit, but the facts that I have left out are
not exculpatory. They are more damning still.

It gets worse from there. FEMA touted the assessment to assure
families  living  in  the  FEMA  trailers  that  the  formaldehyde  fumes
were  nothing  to  worry  about.  Dr.  Howard  Frumkin,  who  is  here
today and will be a witness today, was then and is still the director
of  ATSDR.  Dr.  Frumkin  held  a  dozen  senior  staff  meetings  on  the
formaldehyde  issue  over  a  6-month  period  after  ATSDR  issued  the
report  in  February  2007.  Only  after  unflattering  scrutiny  by  Con-
gressional committees including this subcommittee did ATSDR cor-
rect the health assessment.

Since  then,  this  subcommittee  has  heard  from  many  sources  of
other  examples  of  jackleg  science  by  ATSDR  and  a  keenness  to
please industries and government agencies that prefer to minimize
public  health  consequences  of  environmental  exposures.  Our
sources  have  included  outside  scientists,  residents  of  communities
exposed  to  various  chemicals,  and  ATSDR’s  own  scientists.  Now,
one  ATSDR  staff  scientist  told  our  subcommittee  staff,  ‘‘It  seems
like  the  goal  is  to  disprove  the  communities’  concerns  rather  than
actually trying to prove exposures.’’

Today we will hear about a small number of the cases that have
been  called  to  our  attention  and  about  problems  at  ATSDR  that
date from the Agency’s creation.

And  then  there  is  the  question  of  what  to  do  about  ATSDR.
When federal agencies fail in their mission, the problem is usually
a lack of resources. There is no reason to believe that more funding
or  more  staff  for  ATSDR  would  result  in  anything  other  than  a
greater volume of jackleg assessments saying not to worry.

We  hope  that  the  Obama  Administration  will  take  a  hard  look
at  ATSDR  and  we  may  want  to  consider  legislative  fixes.  First,
there  is  a  possibility  of  peer  review,  outside,  independent  peer  re-
view.  The  statute  now  neither  requires  nor  forbids  ATSDR  from
getting an independent peer review, and in fact, ATSDR very rare-
ly,  if  ever,  gets  a  peer  review.  Most  scientists  see  peer  review  as
helpful, as constructive criticism. ATSDR on the other hand appar-
ently  sees  opinions  of  outside  scientists  as  unwelcome,  meddling,
and  as  a  result,  according  to  the  scientists  we  have  talked  to,  the
research  design  and  methodology  is  often  flawed  and  the  research
is  frequently  not  sound,  accurate  or  complete.  Congress  may  well
want  to  consider  requiring  peer  review,  at  least  in  some  cir-
cumstances,  by  legislation.  It  is  hard  to  know,  however,  how  Con-
gress can require ATSDR’s leadership to have the guts to resist po-
litical pressure and insist of scientific integrity.

The  American  people  deserve  better  and  so  do  the  many  sci-
entists  at  ATSDR  who  have  dedicated  their  lives  to  protecting  the
public  health  and  devoutly  wish  that  ATSDR  faithfully  and  effec-
tively perform the Agency’s stated mission.

[The prepared statement of Chair Miller follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIR BRAD MILLER

The  stated  mission  of  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry
(‘‘ATSDR’’) ‘‘is to serve the public by using the best science, taking responsive public
health  actions,  and  providing  trusted  health  information  to  prevent  harmful  expo-
sures and disease related exposures to toxic substances.’’

The  relatively  obscure  Federal  Government  agency  first  came  to  this  subcommit-
tee’s attention a year and a half or so ago as a result of ATSDR’s health assessment
for  formaldehyde  exposure  by  Katrina  and  Rita  victims  living  in  FEMA  trailers.
Government  at  all  levels  failed  the  victims  of  Katrina  and  Rita  in  many  ways,  but
ATSDR’s  failure  was  perhaps  the  most  unforgivable.  ATSDR’s  health  assessment

the  formaldehyde  fumes  were  nothing  to  worry  about.  Dr.  Howard  Frumkin,  then
and still the Director of ATSDR, will testify today. Dr. Frumkin held a dozen senior
staff  meetings  on  the  formaldehyde  issue  over  a  six-month  period  after  ATSDR
issued the flawed report in February 2007. Only after unflattering scrutiny congres-
sional committees did ATSDR correct the health assessment.

We hope the new Obama Administration will take a hard look at ATSDR. We may
also consider legislative fixes. ATSDR was exempted from forced peer review for its
‘‘health assessments,’’ but the statute never forbid scientific review and the vast ma-
jority of ATSDR’s health reports do not go through independent review today. Most
scientists  see  peer  review  as  helpful,  constructive  criticism.  ATSDR,  on  the  other
hand, apparently sees the opinions of outside scientists as unwelcome meddling. As
a  result,  ATSDR’s  research  design  and  methodology  is  often  flawed,  according  to
other  scientists,  and  ATSDR’s  research  is  frequently  not  sound,  accurate  or  com-
plete.  Perhaps  Congress  could  require  peer  review  by  legislation.  But  it  is  hard  to
know how Congress can require ATSDR’s leadership to have the guts to resist polit-
ical pressure and insist on scientific integrity.

The American people deserve better, and so do the many scientists at ATSDR who
have  dedicated  their  lives  to  protecting  the  public’s  health,  and  devoutly  wish  that
ATSDR faithfully and effectively perform the Agency’s stated mission.

The Agency for Toxic Substances and

the Past, Potential for the Future?

REPORT BY THE MAJORITY STAFF OF THE

SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS AND OVERSIGHT

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

TO SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRMAN BRAD MILLER

MARCH 10, 2009

Introduction

Last  April  the  Subcommittee  on  Investigations  and  Oversight  held  a  hearing  on
the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry  (ATSDR),  a  sister  agency  of
the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC).  The  hearing  looked  at  how
the  Agency  produced  a  scientifically  flawed  and  misleading  health  consultation  on
the  health  hazards  of  potential  formaldehyde  exposures  by  survivors  of  Hurricanes
Katrina  and  Rita  living  in  travel  trailers  provided  by  the  Federal  Emergency  Man-
agement Agency (FEMA).1 Last September the Subcommittee issued a detailed staff
report on our investigation which found that: ‘‘The leadership of ATSDR obfuscated
their  role  in  reviewing  and  approving  the  February  2007  health  consultation  and
attempted to abdicate their own responsibility for the Agency’s fundamental failure
to  protect  the  public’s  health.  Most  disturbingly,  as  the  Agency’s  troubled  response
to  the  formaldehyde  fiasco  unraveled,  the  leadership  of  ATSDR  attempted  to  shift
blame  for  the  inappropriate  handling  of  the  incident  to  others,  primarily  [whistle-
blower  Dr.  Chris]  De  Rosa  and  his  staff.’’ 2 Unfortunately,  the  poor  scientific  integ-
rity  of  ATSDR’s  formaldehyde  health  consultation  and  the  weak  leadership  at  the
Agency  that  permitted  the  production  of  this  misleading  report  which  went  uncor-

rected  for  so  long—keeping  the  public  in  harm’s  way  for  a  year  longer  than  nec-
essary—was not an isolated incident.

The  Agency’s  mission  ‘‘is  to  serve  the  public  by  using  the  best  science,  taking  re-
sponsive  public  health  actions,  and  providing  trusted  health  information  to  prevent
harmful exposures and disease related to toxic substances.’’3 On paper, according to
ATSDR,  the  Agency  is  deeply  involved  with  the  local  communities  it  is  intended  to
help  protect,  it  makes  independent,  objective  health  decisions  based  on  the  best
science available, it conducts exposure investigations to assess health impacts of en-
vironmental  toxins  and  it  provides  and  explains  the  results  of  their  evaluations,
medical consultations and investigations to local communities and tribes.4 In reality,
across the Nation local community groups believe that ATSDR has failed to protect
them  from  toxic  exposures  and  independent  scientists  are  often  aghast  at  the  lack
of  scientific  rigor  in  its  health  consultations  and  assessments.  The  studies  lack  the
ability  to  properly  attribute  illness  to  toxic  exposures  and  the  methodologies  used
by  the  Agency  to  identify  suspected  environmental  exposures  to  hazardous  chemi-
cals are doomed from the start.

The  Subcommittee  staff  is  not  suggesting  that  ATSDR  find  problems  where  none
exist or that ATSDR should or can identify the sources of a possible cancer cluster,
disease  or  other  health  hazard  in  every  instance  or  where  the  potential  source  of
toxic exposures are ambiguous or elusive. Yet time and time again ATSDR appears
to  avoid  clearly  and  directly  confronting  the  most  obvious  toxic  culprits  that  harm
the  health  of  local  communities  throughout  the  Nation.  Instead,  they  deny,  delay,
minimize,  trivialize  or  ignore  legitimate  concerns  and  health  considerations  of  local
communities and well respected scientists and medical professionals.

Many  independent  scientists,  medical  professionals,  local  environmental  groups
and  public  health  advocates  believe  that  rather  than  objectively  and  aggressively
trying  to  identify  the  source  of  reported  health  problems,  ATSDR  often  seeks  ways
to avoid linking local health problems to specific sources of hazardous chemicals. In-
stead, says one current ATSDR scientist who spoke to the Committee on the condi-
tion  of  anonymity:  ‘‘It  seems  like  the  goal  is  to  disprove  the  communities’  concerns
rather than actually trying to prove exposures.’’ None of these problems are new to
ATSDR but it will require a new will and desire to fix them on the part of ATSDR’s
leadership.

Background

In  1980  Congress  created  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry
(ATSDR)  through  the  enactment  of  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,
Compensation,  and  Liability  Act  of  1980  (CERCLA)  (Public  Law  96–510)  commonly
referred  to  as  ‘‘Superfund.’’  CERCLA  authorized  the  Environmental  Protection
Agency  (EPA)  to  clean  up  nationally  identified  toxic  waste  (Superfund)  sites  and
Section 104(i) required the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Pub-
lic  Health  Service  to  establish  a  new  agency  to  carry  out  health-related  activities
at  these  waste  sites.5 Thus,  ATSDR  was  created  to  help  determine  the  potential
human health consequences of releases of toxic chemicals at these sites.

Although ATSDR was created with the best of intentions, it had an extremely dif-
ficult  birth  and  has  struggled  ever  since.  The  EPA  and  HHS  provided  it  with  little
support  and  at  times  tried  to  subvert  it.  It  took  three  years  after  enactment  of  the
law  that  authorized  the  creation  of  ATSDR  for  the  Agency  to  actually  emerge.  By
June  1983  the  HHS’  Public  Health  Service  ‘‘had  developed  few  detailed  procedures
concerning the new agency and how the Superfund responsibilities would be carried
out,’’  according  to  a  report  from  Congress’s  investigative  arm,  the  U.S.  General  Ac-
counting  Office  (GAO).6 ‘‘HHS  objected  to  establishing  a  separate  agency  to  carry
out  its  Superfund  responsibilities,  contending  it  was  not  necessary.’’ 7 In  fact,  HHS
never  wanted  ATSDR  to  have  its  own  staff  and  tried  to  reign  in  the  new  agency’s
independence by detailing CDC staff to ATSDR and forcing it to use CDC’s adminis-
trative and support structure.8

In  addition,  because  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  reduced  the
number  of  HHS  requested  staffing  positions  in  1984  to  ATSDR,  CDC  officials  told
GAO’s  investigators  that  because  of  limited  staff  ‘‘they  expected  to  eliminate  vir-
tually  all  [of  ATSDR’s  planned]  long-term  health  studies,  [health]  registries,  and
laboratory projects.’’ 9 During this same time-frame both EPA and OMB consistently
reduced  ATSDR’s  annual  budget.10 Three  years  after  ATSDR  was  physically  estab-
lished, a new law was passed, the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
of  1986  (SARA)  that  set  an  arbitrary  deadline  of  December  1988  for  the  Agency  to
conduct  health  assessments  at  951  Superfund  sites.  The  law  was  necessary  at  the
time,  many  believed,  because  ATSDR  had  made  zero  headway  in  accomplishing
these  tasks.  As  a  result  of  the  new  law  ATSDR  developed  ‘‘initial  mandate  assess-
ments’’  at  950  sites  within  a  little  over  two  years.  The  Agency  achieved  a  quan-
titative victory in producing so many assessments is so little time.

But Congress’s desire to force the new understaffed agency to become more effec-
tive,  efficient  and  responsive  to  fulfilling  its  initial  mandate  had  unintended  quali-
tative consequences. In order to prepare health assessments on 951 Superfund sites
within  this  time  period  ATSDR  wrote  785  assessments  in  15  months  and  ‘‘labeled
165  previously  prepared  documents  in  its  files  as  health  assessments’’  even  though
some  were  several  years  old,  according  to  GAO.  To  accomplish  this  massive  effort,
ATSDR  ignored  ‘‘its  own  guidance  requiring  visits  to  sites’’  and  instead  conducted
‘‘desk’’  assessments,  GAO  found.  The  Agency,  for  instance,  labeled  previously  pro-
duced  documents  not  intended  to  be  full  health  assessments  as  ‘‘assessments.’’  ‘‘In
the  rush  to  complete  these  assessments,  ATSDR  dropped  plans  to  do  full  internal
quality checks on its assessments, and no review was made by outside experts,’’ ac-
cording to GAO.11

When  GAO  reviewed  the  quality  and  usefulness  of  ATSDR’s  health  assessments
in  1991  they  hired  five  independent  experts  to  evaluate  15  of  the  Agency’s  assess-
ments.  What  they  found  was  that  the  initial  mandate  assessments  ‘‘were  seriously
deficient  overall.’’  Although  follow  up  assessments  were  improved  over  the  earlier
assessments  GAO’s  expert  reviewers  ‘‘continued  to  find  deficiencies  in  evidence  or
analysis, such as unsupported conclusions.’’

GAO  concluded  that  ATSDR  needed  to  improve  its  quality  controls  and  to  estab-
lish ‘‘some independent peer review.’’ It found that ATSDR should involve local com-
munities  more  in  developing  assessments.  The  GAO  panel  also  found  the  reports  it
reviewed contained ‘‘(1) inadequate descriptions or analyses of health risks, (2) fail-
ures to indicate whether communities had been exposed to contaminants, (3) overly
general  recommendations,  and  (4)  inattention  to  the  sufficiency  of  data.’’ 12 One  of
the GAO panel members said that ‘‘regardless of the wide diversity of sites that we
studied [the assessments] come up with the same conclusion: that there is a poten-
tial  problem.’’  Incredibly  out  of  the  951  initial  assessments  ATSDR  conducted  it
found just 13 sites as posing a ‘‘significant health risk.’’ 13

In  the  rush  to  push  out  nearly  1,000  health  assessments  in  two  years  time  the
Agency  developed  a  check-box  mentality  that  helped  to  undermine  virtually  every-
thing the Agency did. Quality became an after-thought to the ability to produce pub-
lic  health  documents  quickly.  The  integrity  of  the  data,  assessment  of  the  public
health risks and credibility of the conclusions all suffered deeply as a result.

Unfortunately,  the  past  problems  identified  by  GAO  have  not  disappeared.  Re-
views  of  the  FEMA  trailer  health  consultation  on  formaldehyde,  as  well  as  other
health  reports  from  ATSDR,  appears  to  suggest  the  Agency  has  never  recovered
from the initial problems that overshadowed its birth. Internally, many ATSDR em-
ployees have told the Subcommittee over the past year that the Agency lacks appro-
priate quality controls, it conducts inadequate analyses of health risks to local com-
munities and they often do not collect and analyze the most relevant and revealing
data  about  potential  environmental  health  hazards.  Externally,  the  local  commu-
nities  that  ATSDR  was  created  to  help  protect  often  believe  the  Agency  does  more
harm than good by offering them reassuring but unfounded and unsound advice and
analysis  which  simply  creates  an  artificial  perception  of  safety  to  the  public  that  is
not supported by scientific inquiry or independent examination.

Investigating  environmental  public  health  issues  is  a  difficult  and  daunting  task.
Local  communities  expect  State  or  federal  public  health  agencies  to  identify  the
cause  of  their  specific  health  concerns,  provide  medical  or  other  support  and  eradi-
cate the environmental hazard. In some cases it is exceedingly difficult to establish
a  definitive  link  between  specific  toxic  exposures  and  health  problems.  In  other
cases it may be difficult to quantify an actual health problem and in some instances
the  scientific  evidence  may  not  identify  any  problem  let  alone  the  specific  cause  of
a health problem. But in many, many cases ATSDR seems to get the science wrong,
ignores community complaints or both.

Midlothian, Texas—Cement Kilns

Mr.  Sal  Mier  is  a  local  resident  of  Midlothian,  Texas  and  former  official  at  the
Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC).  Midlothian  is  known  as  the  ce-
ment  capital  of  the  world  and  is  home  to  three  cement  plants  and  one  steel  mill.
These  plants  have  released  nearly  one  billion  pounds  of  toxic  chemicals  into  the
local  environment  since  1990.  The  Texas  Commission  on  Environmental  Quality
(TCEQ)  began  environmental  monitoring  in  Midlothian  in  1991.  In  June  2005,  the
Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) completed a review of the Texas
Birth  Defects  registry  and  found  that  one  type  of  birth  defect  related  to  urinary
tract  development  (hypospadias  or  epispadias)  was  statistically  elevated.  The  pre-
vious month DSHS completed a cancer cluster investigation that found no elevation
in  cancers  when  it  examined  residents  in  three  zip  codes  in  Midlothian  and  two
other towns.14 But by expanding the pool of individuals in this investigation to those
outside  of  Midlothian,  critics  say  the  study  diminished  the  ability  to  specifically
identify increased rates of cancers among Midlothian residents.

In  2005,  Mr.  Mier  petitioned  ATSDR  to  look  into  health  issues  in  Midlothian.  In
August 2005, ATSDR agreed to conduct a health assessment on the potential health
effects of toxic substances released from Midlothian’s cement kilns. Under a coopera-
tive  agreement  with  ATSDR,  DSHS  would  conduct  the  health  investigation  along
with  some  support,  review  and  final  concurrence  by  ATSDR.  In  December  2005,
DSHS  said  that  the  health  consultation  would  be  completed  and  reviewed  by
ATSDR  and  released  for  public  comment  by  ‘‘the  first  part  of  February  2006.’’ 15 In
February  2006  the  document’s  release  date  was  pushed  back  to  March  2006  ‘‘due
to the large volume of information to be reviewed.’’ 16

In December 2007, 27 months after ATSDR began their investigation, the Agency
finally released a ‘‘draft’’ health consultation for ‘‘public comment.’’ The report found
that  for  the  vast  majority  of  chemicals  they  examined  there  was  no  public  health
hazard.  They  concluded,  for  instance,  that  there  was  ‘‘no  evidence  to  suggest  that
adverse  health  effects  would  be  anticipated  as  a  result  of  any  of  the  short-term  or
peak  exposures  to  VOCs  [Volatile  Organic  Compounds]  or  Metals’’  being  emitted
from  the  plants  in  Midlothian.  The  Agency’s  overall  conclusion  was  that  the  air  in
Midlothian  posed  an  ‘‘Indeterminate  Public  Health  Hazard.’’ 17 A  ‘‘final’’  version  of
that study is planned to be released in the next couple of months—more than three
and one half years after the investigation began.

Mr. Mier received comments on this document from several independent scientists
who  concluded  it  was  deeply  flawed.  Dr.  Stuart  Batterman,  Associate  Chairman  of
the  Department  of  Environmental  Health  Sciences,  School  of  Public  Health  at  the
University of Michigan, wrote: ‘‘The Health Consultation is biased. It contains over-
arching  statements  that  discount  all  indications  that  emissions  from  local  industry
and environmental conditions might or do pose a health concern in the community.’’
Dr. Peter L. deFur, a Research Associate Professor in the Center for Environmental
Studies  at  Virginia  Commonwealth  University  agreed.  ‘‘Throughout  the  document,
ATSDR  attempts  to  marginalize  or  disregard  data  that  indicate  that  compounds
produce human health risks. ATSDR has more than enough data to classify the site
as  a  ‘‘Public  Health  Hazard.’’  For  the  past  fifteen  months  ATSDR  has  been  review-
ing these and many other public comments they received on their draft health con-

of months.

from  Midlothian 

It is clear that the release of toxic material from the three cement plants and steel
mill  in  Midlothian  has  been  enormous  over  the  years.  Using  State  and  federal
records from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory
(TRI)  and  TCEQ’s  Emission  Inventory  two  graduate  students  at  the  University  of
North  Texas,  Amanda  Caldwell  and  Susan  Waskey,  conducted  a  study  of  the  local
emissions 
local  environmental  non-profit  group
Downwinders  At  Risk.  The  study  found  that  between  1990  and  2006  these  four  in-
dustrial plants released more than one billion pounds of toxic emissions to the envi-
ronment.  The  emissions  were  a  brew  of  toxic  substances,  including  millions  of
pounds  of  manganese,  lead  and  sulfuric  acid,  as  well  as  hundreds  of  thousands  of
pounds  of  trichloroethylene,  zinc  compounds,  mercury,  benzene,  hydrochloric  acid,
formaldehyde, toluene and other hazardous chemicals.18 Tying down specific health
effects  to  individual  industrial  plants  in  Midlothian  would  be  a  difficult  under-
taking.  But  Midlothian  residents  are  frustrated  that  ATSDR  has  ignored  critical
signs  of  potential  health  problems  in  the  community  and  has  essentially  given  the
community a clean bill of health despite many indications that the community may
be suffering from health problems due to exposures to industrial pollutants.

Sue Pope, a Midlothian resident and one of the creators of Downwinders At Risk,
had  hair  samples  of  55  people  living  in  or  near  Midlothian,  many  of  them  infants
and young children, analyzed for toxic substances between 1988 and 1993. What the
tests  revealed  was  that  many  of  the  residents  had  high  levels  of  aluminum,  lead,
cadmium and nickel. She turned over copies of these documents to Texas State au-
thorities  who  were  investigating  health  issues  in  Midlothian,  but  she  says  nothing
ever came of it.

Other  residents  and  independent  scientists  have  chronicled  health  problems  in
Midlothian  too.  In  1998,  scientists  led  by  Dr.  Marvin  Legator  at  the  University  of
Texas  Medical  Branch,  Division  of  Environmental  Toxicology  published  a  peer-re-
viewed paper in the journal Toxicology and Industrial Health titled: ‘‘The Health Ef-
fects  of  Living  Near  Cement  Kilns;  A  Symptom  Survey  in  Midlothian,  Texas.’’  The
study found that respiratory illnesses in Midlothian were three times more common
than in neighboring Waxahatchie.19

Two years earlier, Legator published an editorial in the Archives of Environmental
Health,  titled:  ‘‘A  Deliberate  Smokescreen,’’  which  criticized  the  scientific  integrity
of  ATSDR’s  studies  and  the  methods  ATSDR  uses  in  an  attempt  to  investigate  po-
tential  environmental  exposures.  In  the  article  Legator  and  a  colleague  rec-
ommended  ‘‘that  careful  evaluation  be  made  of  a  significant  number  of  ATSDR  or
ATSDR-sponsored  studies  to  determine  how  well  the  victims  of  chemical  exposure
and our taxpayers have been served by this agency.’’ 20

Last December USA Today ran an in-depth special report titled ‘‘The Smokestack
Effect: Toxic Air and America’s Schools,’’ that used the same EPA data as the report
on Midlothian’s toxic emissions by Caldwell and Waskey to track the path of indus-
trial pollution and then mapped the locations of almost 128,000 schools to determine
the levels of toxic chemicals in their path. The USA Today report’s interactive map
of  the  United  States  shows  that  of  the  nine  schools  located  in  Midlothian,  Texas,
two  of  them  were  ranked  in  the  1st  percentile  of  the  schools  exposed  to  the  most
toxic  chemicals  in  the  Nation,  three  of  the  schools  were  ranked  in  the  third  per-
centile and each of the others were ranked in the 6th, 14th, 21st and 32nd percent-
iles.  According  to  the  USA  Today  report  only  174  of  the  Nation’s  127,809  schools
they  ranked  had  worse  toxic  air  exposures  than  the  Mt.  Peak  Elementary  School
in Midlothian, for instance.21

Anecdotally,  many  Midlothian  children  apparently  have  severe  cases  of  asthma,
cancer  cases  are  wide-ranging  among  the  population  and  there  has  been  a  history
of  poor  health  problems  among  cattle,  horses  and  other  animals  in  the  area.  Debra
Markwardt, a local Midlothian dog breeder, recently suggested to ATSDR’s Director,
Dr.  Howard  Frumkin,  that  his  agency  examine  her  dogs  as  an  indicator  of  what  is
happening to the human population in Midlothian. Markwardt moved to Midlothian
in 1988. Her dogs soon started experiencing a wide-range of disturbing health prob-

lems.  The  photos  of  her  dogs  are  troubling.  Some  were  born  with  missing  limbs,
many  had  skin  problems,  and  others  were  born  with  organs  outside  of  their  bodies
and entire litters died shortly after birth. Most surprisingly, dogs that were sold and
moved  off  of  her  property  with  severe  skin  problems  began  to  regain  their  health
within months but those that stayed continued to suffer from ill-health effects. (See
photos of Markwardt’s dogs in attachment).

Recently,  Markwardt  had  herself  and  some  of  her  dogs  tested  for  heavy  metals.
Over  the  past  few  years,  veterinarians  have  found  high  levels  of  aluminum  in  her
animals, she says. In May 2007, Ms. Markwardt’s own doctor wrote: ‘‘She has lived
in  a  home  that  has  very  high  levels  of  aluminum  in  the  soil  and  in  the  dust  that
is  found  in  the  home.  She  has  had  a  urinalysis  that  shows  her  aluminum  level  to
be markedly elevated and it should be zero,’’ wrote her doctor. Last July, her veteri-
narian wrote: ‘‘It is my opinion that these dogs need to be moved off of the property.
Since  nothing  medical  has  helped,  it  is  highly  probable  that  this  is  an  environ-
mental problem.’’

On  December  19,  2008,  Dr.  William  Cibulas,  the  Director  of  ATSDR’s  Division  of
Health  Assessment  &  Consultation  (DHAC)  wrote  to  Ms.  Markwardt  on  behalf  of
Dr.  Frumkin.  ‘‘ATSDR  is  sympathetic  toward  the  plight  of  your  animals,  however,
veterinary and animal issues are outside of our mandated domain,’’ he wrote. Clear-
ly  frustrated  by  this  response  Ms.  Markwardt  exchanged  some  more  e-mails  with
ATSDR.

On  January  22,  2009,  Markwardt  wrote  back  to  ATSDR  and  copied  Dr.  Frumkin
on  the  e-mail.  ‘‘Please  do  not  tell  me  again  that  veterinary  and  animal  issues  are
outside of [your] mandated domain. You know full well (or should) that the potential
impact  on  people  is  the  issue  that  I  raised,’’  wrote  Markwardt.  ‘‘All  that  we  have
asked you to do is to provide trusted health information. Do you feel that an honest
conclusion  in  the  Midlothian  Public  Health  Consultation  can  be  reached  by  pre-
tending  what  is  happening  to  these  animals  is  not  happening;  therefore,  it  cannot
be an indicator of what is happening to human health?’’

The next day, on January 23, 2009, a technical officer in DHAC, Alan Yarbrough,
responded.  ‘‘Again,  ATSDR  is  sympathetic  to  the  plight  of  your  animals,’’  he  wrote,
‘‘but  studies  involving  animals,  even  as  sentinels  for  human  health  issues,  are  not
activities engaged in or funded by our agency.’’

In  1991,  however,  the  National  Academies  of  Sciences’  Committee  on  Animals  as
Monitors of Environmental Hazards was charged by ATSDR ‘‘to review and evaluate
the  usefulness  of  animal  epidemiologic  studies  for  human  risk  assessment  and  to
recommend  types  of  data  that  should  be  collected  to  perform  risk  assessments  for
human  populations.’’  In  their  final  176-page  report  for  ATSDR,  the  academy  wrote
that  animals  can  be  ‘‘used  to  monitor  concentrations  of  pollutants’’  and  ‘‘can  yield
a better evaluation of hazard to humans’’ than ‘‘mechanical devices can.’’ In fact, the
academy concluded: ‘‘An investigator planning an environmental assessment should
always  consider  using  an  animal  sentinel  system,  when  it  is  practicable,  as  an  ad-
junct  to  conventional  assessment  procedures.  Animal  sentinel  data  are  likely  to  be
especially  useful  in  circumstances  where  the  conventional  procedures  are  most
prone to uncertainty, including assessing accumulated chemicals, complex mixtures,
complex exposures, uncertain bioavailability, and poorly characterized agents.’’ 22

Since  then  ATSDR  has  published  numerous  health  consultations  involving  ani-
mals. In April 2003 under a cooperative agreement with the California Department
of  Health  Services,  ATSDR  released  a  health  consultation  regarding  contamination
in  the  private  water  wells  of  residents  near  the  Pacific  Gas  and  Electric  Facility  in
Hinkley,  California,  made  famous  by  environmental  investigator  and  activist  Erin
Brockovich.  In  that  instance,  the  health  consultation  did  examine  the  potential
health  impact  on  horses,  cows,  dogs  and  cats  from  the  exposures  to  Nitrate,  Lead,
Thallium  and  Chromium.23 In  March  2005,  ATSDR  released  a  health  consultation
that  investigated  potential  exposures  from  TCE  in  private  well  water  of  both  hu-
mans  and  animals  in  the  City  of  Cliff  Village,  Missouri.  The  investigation  began
after  several  residents  and  domestic  animals  in  the  Cliff  Village  area  experienced

unusual  health  problems  that  resulted  in  the  death  of  a  domestic  animal.24 In  De-
cember,  2005,  ATSDR  issued  a  health  consultation  that  investigated  the  poisoning
of a 97-pound Siberian Husky in Des Moines, Iowa.25

The above cases were gleaned from a cursory search of ATSDR’s web-page by the
Subcommittee.  Why  ATSDR  refused  Debra  Markwardt’s  request  is  unclear,  but
there is certainly precedent for ATSDR to examine animals, particularly when there
health and safety are closely tied to the health and safety of people.

On  February  6,  2009,  ATSDR’s  Yarbrough  responded  again  to  Ms.  Markwardt.
But  this  time,  the  Agency’s  rationale  for  refusing  to  investigate  the  health  of
Markwardt’s dogs changed slightly. Originally, Markwardt was told ‘‘veterinary and
animal  issues  are  outside  of  our  mandated  domain,’’  wrote  ATSDR.  This  time,
Yarbrough  wrote:  ‘‘ATSDR’s  enabling  legislation  does  not  prohibit  our  conduct  of
animal  studies;  however,  ATSDR  and  the  Texas  Department  of  State  Health  Serv-
ices do not have the expertise to conduct the appropriate animal studies,’’ he wrote.
Instead,  ATSDR  told  Markwardt  that  they  referred  her  case  to  two  veterinarians
with  Texas  A&M.  But  the  researchers  do  not  yet  have  any  funding  to  support  an
investigation and they have not yet contacted her.

Polycythemia Vera Cancer Cluster in Eastern Pennsylvania

Dr. Ronald Hoffman, MD, is Professor of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology Section,
at the Tisch Cancer Institute and Professor of Gene and Cell Medicine at Mt. Sinai
School  of  Medicine  in  New  York.  He  is  also  the  former  President  of  the  American
Society of Hematology. Dr. Hoffman is a leading expert on a rare cancer called poly-
cythemia  vera  (PV).  He  had  never  heard  of  ATSDR  before  being  called  by  ATSDR
staff  in  2006  to  lend  his  expertise  to  an  investigation  it  was  conducting  in  eastern
Pennsylvania examining a potential cluster of PV cases.

In October 2006, ATSDR began assisting the Pennsylvania Department of Health
in investigating the high number of reported PV cases in three counties in Pennsyl-
vania—Carbon,  Luzerne  and  Schuylkill  counties.  The  area  ATSDR  investigated  is
home  to  seven  Superfund  hazardous  waste  sites  that  are  either  closed  or  in  the
process of being remediated and seven waste coal burning power plants, which emit
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Recent research has suggested PAHs may
potentially contribute to polycythemia vera.

The  local  community  has  suspected  that  environmental  pollution  in  the  area  has
a  contributor  to  health  problems  there  for  a  long  time.  By  the  fall  of  2007,  ATSDR
had confirmed more than three dozen cases of PV in the area, more than four times
the level outside the region. The Agency also discovered four cases of PV on one two-
mile  stretch  of  road  not  far  from  the  former  McAdoo  superfund  site.  None  of  the
PV patients on Ben Titus Road in Northeast Schuylkill County were blood relatives.
Two of them, who both passed away last year, were husband and wife. The environ-
mental significance of this tight grouping of PV cases on a single road and the prox-
imity to a hazardous waste site seemed obvious to many, including Dr. Ronald Hoff-
man.

But that connection did not appear so obvious to ATSDR. The lead ATSDR official
in  charge  of  the  investigation,  Dr.  Steven  Dearwent,  described  it  to  Subcommittee
staff  as  ‘‘compelling’’  information,  but  nothing  more.  On  October  24,  2007,  ATSDR
released a ‘‘media announcement’’ regarding their PV investigation. The Agency con-
firmed more than three dozen cases of PV in Schuylkill, Luzerne and Carbon coun-
ties  in  Pennsylvania  but  assured  the  public:  ‘‘ATSDR  found  no  link  between  envi-
ronmental factors and PV in this area.’’ 26 The Agency also failed to mention in the
media announcement the four PV cases it found along Ben Titus Road near a former
Superfund site, although they had already confirmed these cases at the time.

So, when Dr. Hoffman presented an abstract of the PV investigation at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Atlanta in December 2007 titled:
‘‘Evidence  for  an  Environmental  Influence  Leading  to  the  Development  of
JAK2V617F–Positive  Polycythemia  Vera:  A  Molecular  Epidemiological  Study,’’  this
apparent contradiction did not sit well with some ATSDR officials. The Agency says

the  paper,  which  included  the  names  of  ATSDR  scientists,  did  not  go  through
ATSDR’s ‘‘clearance process.’’

In  December  2007,  the  Associated  Press  reported  that  ATSDR  was  distancing
itself  from  Dr.  Hoffman  and  his  paper.  Dr.  Dearwent,  the  senior  ATSDR  official  in
charge  of  the  PV  cluster  investigation  told  the  AP:  ‘‘We’re  going  to  have  to  retract
the abstract to correct the record because it is erroneous information.’’ Dr. Dearwent
claimed  that  the  abstract  had  been  written  early  in  the  summer  and  that  subse-
quent  analysis  of  the  data  did  not  support  the  conclusion  of  an  environmental
link.27 In  fact,  it  seems  nothing  had  actually  changed  regarding  the  data  but  that
ATSDR did not feel comfortable drawing any connection between the PV cluster and
potential  chemical  exposures  in  the  environment.  Dr.  Dearwent  told  Subcommittee
staff  that  because  Dr.  Hoffman  is  a  ‘‘clinician’’  and  not  an  epidemiologist  he  may
have viewed the PV cluster differently than the Agency. Dr. Dearwent said that ‘‘we
had  nothing  telling  us  at  the  time  nor  do  we  now’’  that  this  cluster  is  somehow
linked to environmental exposures.

To  his  credit,  Dr.  Hoffman  presented  his  abstract  at  the  American  Society  of  He-
matology  conference  despite  efforts  by  ATSDR  to  interfere  with  his  presentation.
Last  year,  ATSDR  posted  an  oddly  worded  statement  about  the  abstract  on  its
website.  The  Agency  said  that  the  conclusions  in  the  abstract  differed  from  what
ATSDR  told  the  public  in  October  2007  and  that  it  ‘‘prematurely’’  inferred  certain
conclusions  about  the  PV  cluster.  Yet,  it  concluded:  ‘‘The  presentation  made  at  the
American Hematology Society meeting accurately reflected ATSDR’s current assess-
ment of the data.’’ 28

In  January  2008  Dr.  Hoffman  e-mailed  Dr.  Howard  Frumkin,  the  director  of
ATSDR, about his experience with the PV investigation. ‘‘I believe that some mem-
bers  of  your  staff  are  unable,  incapable  or  unwilling  to  objectively  looking  [sic]  at
this  data,’’  wrote  Hoffman.  ‘‘This  nonscientific  approach  has  led  to  a  state  of  denial
and  paralysis  in  you  [sic]  organization  which  has  resulted  in  the  present  confusion
about this matter in the community and the press. There are important issues here
and  objectivity  is  required,’’  wrote  Hoffman.  ‘‘I  hope  that  the  cynical  and  nihilistic
behavior  of  some  of  your  staff  is  not  a  reflection  of  the  scientific  veracity  of  the
Agency[.]’’

In this case, ATSDR finally acknowledged that a cancer cluster existed in the area
of Eastern Pennsylvania they investigated. The Agency released the final results of
their investigation last August and found residents in the three counties in Pennsyl-
vania  that  they  assessed  were  more  than  four  times  more  likely  to  develop  poly-
cythemia  vera  than  people  living  outside  those  counties.  And  while  ATSDR  said
‘‘There were potential environmental exposure sources common to some of the high-
rate  areas,’’  they  concluded  that:  ‘‘It  is  not  known  whether  a  relationship  exists  be-
tween  any  of  these  sources  and  the  PV  cases.’’ 29 The  Agency  said  future  studies
may attempt to investigate the environmental connection further. Dr. Hoffman says
that  ATSDR  continually  sought  to  downplay  and  minimize  any  links  between  the
PV  cases  and  the  environment  suggesting  it  was  just  an  unusual  circumstance.  He
described their behavior as ‘‘very odd and counter-intuitive.’’

Interestingly,  in  1993  ATSDR  conducted  a  public  health  assessment  on  the
McAdoo Associates Superfund site. That site had ceased operations in 1979, was re-
mediated  and  taken  off  of  the  Superfund  list  in  2001.  The  1993  ATSDR  public
health  assessment  of  the  site  found:  ‘‘Site-related  contamination  poses  no  public
health hazard because there is no evidence of current or past exposures, and future
exposures  to  contaminants  at  levels  of  public  health  concern  are  unlikely.’’ 30 Ben
Titus  Road  where  ATSDR  investigators  discovered  four  unrelated  PV  cases  is  close
to  this  site.  But  conceding  that  there  may  be  an  environmental  health  hazard
present  in  this  community  today  could  put  ATSDR  in  the  awkward  position  of  ac-
knowledging mistakes with their past public health conclusions.

In  the  wake  of  internal  disagreements  between  Dr.  Hoffman  and  ATSDR  regard-
ing the potential link between environmental contamination and the PV cluster, Dr.

Hoffman says he pushed to publish a peer-reviewed article of the PV investigation’s
findings,  fearing  that  ATSDR  was  not  willing  or  able  to  acknowledge  the  signifi-
cance  of  the  PV  cluster  in  Pennsylvania.  Last  month  the  work  of  Dr.  Hoffman,
ATSDR scientists and other colleagues at the University of Illinois College of Medi-
cine,  published  their  findings  in  the  journal  Cancer,  Epidemiology,  Biomarkers  and
Prevention. The paper reported that the risk of developing PV was 4.3 times greater
for  the  residents  living  inside  the  three  Pennsylvania  counties  they  examined  than
for those living outside the area. The article concluded: ‘‘The close proximity of this
cluster to known areas of hazardous material exposure raises concern that such en-
vironmental  factors  might  play  a  role  in  the  origin  of  polycythemia  vera.’’ 31 Dr.
Dearwent,  who  was  not  an  author  on  the  paper,  contends  that  ‘‘some  of  the  lan-
guage  in  the  manuscript  that  we  opposed  made  it  back  in  to  the  paper.’’  Dr.  Hoff-
man and other authors of the paper deny that.

Asbestos Beach—Illinois State Beach Park in Chicago

Mr.  Jeffery  Camplin  is  President  of  Camplin  Environmental  Services  and  tech-
nical consultant to the Dunesland Preservation Society in Illinois. Since 2003 he has
been investigating asbestos contamination on the Illinois shoreline of Lake Michigan
and  has  filed  several  complaints  with  ATSDR  regarding  the  inadequacies  of  their
studies  of  asbestos  contamination  at  the  Illinois  State  Beach  Park  in  Chicago.  He
is  a  certified  safety  professional  (C.S.P.),  certified  professional  environmental  audi-
tor  (C.P.E.A.)  and  has  been  an  accredited  instructor  in  asbestos  abatement  by  the
Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  for  more  than  20  years.  In  2006  he  was
named  Environmental  Safety  Professional  of  the  year  by  the  American  Society  of
Safety  Engineers  (ASSE).  He  is  also  the  lead  safety  volunteer  for  the  Illinois  Med-
ical Emergency Response Team (IMERT).

In  Illinois  there  has  been  a  long  history  of  asbestos  containing  materials  and  fi-
bers  washing  up  on  the  shoreline  of  Lake  Michigan  for  more  than  one  decade.  The
Johns-Manville  Corporation  built  a  large  plant  on  the  shore  of  Lake  Michigan  that
produced insulation products containing asbestos beginning in the 1920s. The plant,
which  included  a  150-acre  asbestos  disposal  area  containing  approximately  three
million  cubic  yards  of  asbestos-containing  waste,  was  declared  a  Superfund  site  in
1983  and  ceased  operations  in  1998.  The  asbestos  disposal  area  was  covered  with
soil to prevent its spread. But since then seven areas containing asbestos-containing
material from the plant were discovered off-site.32

Around  the  same  time  as  the  plant’s  closure,  asbestos  debris  began  washing  up
along  the  shoreline  at  the  Illinois  Beach  State  Park,  the  state’s  most  popular  park
at  two  to  three  million  visitors  per  year.33 In  May  2000,  the  Illinois  Department  of
Public Health under a cooperative agreement with ATSDR released a public health
assessment regarding asbestos contamination at the State park. The report did find
that  asbestos  containing  material  had  been  found  scattered  along  the  beach  at  the
park and that material containing ‘‘low asbestos levels’’ had been discovered, but not
at levels that would be expected to cause adverse health effects in Park workers or
visitors,’’ it said. The report concluded: ‘‘no apparent public health hazard exists re-
lated to asbestos contamination at Illinois Beach State Park.’’ 34

But the discovery of asbestos material on the public beach at the State park never
ceased.  Portions  of  the  State  park  were  cleared  of  asbestos  in  March  2006.  In  the
summer  of  2006  ATSDR  used  grading  equipment  to  churn  up  the  sand  and  air  fil-
ters  to  capture  and  measure  any  potential  asbestos  fibers.  The  tests  discovered  fi-
bers of amphibole asbestos, the most toxic kind of asbestos.

In  2007  ATSDR  wrote  a  draft  health  consultation  based  on  their  findings  which
said there was no health hazard from the asbestos. In April 2007, local EPA officials
submitted  written  comments  of  the  report  to  ATSDR.  The  letter,  written  by  Brad

the  EPA’s  lead  asbestos  expert  covering  Illinois,  Indiana,  Michigan,  Minnesota,
Ohio,  and  Wisconsin,  was  written  to  Mark  Johnson,  ATSDR’s  regional  representa-
tive  in  Chicago,  on  behalf  of  the  entire  EPA  Region  5  staff.  The  letter  identified  13
items they believed needed clarification or correction. Many of them were not subtle
editorial  fixes  but  significant  issues  revolving  around  safety  and  health  issues  and
the scientific integrity of the ATSDR report. The letter said many of the statements
by ATSDR were ‘‘misleading,’’ ‘‘questionable’’ and contained ‘‘inconsistencies.’’ 35

‘‘The paragraph on page 12, which states that ‘‘Based on the bulk analysis of sand
samples  collected,  the  sand  in  [and]  of  itself  does  not  appear  to  pose  a  significant
source  of  asbestos  fibers’’  is  a  little  misleading,’’  wrote  Bradley.  ‘‘The  air  samples
near the beach grading equipment were significantly elevated; therefore, this would
indicate that there might be a problem with this statement,’’ he wrote. But the final
ATSDR  health  consultation  read:  ‘‘Based  on  the  bulk  analysis  of  sand  samples  col-
lected, the sand does not appear to pose a significant source of asbestos fibers.’’ The
public health agency ignored the EPA’s concerns about the public’s health.

The  EPA  noted  other  problems  that  ATSDR  also  simply  chose  to  ignore.  In  his

concerns regarding the safety of human use of the beaches. There is ACM [Asbestos

question  in  their  final  report.  ‘‘What  are  the  conclusions  of  the  EI  [Environmental
Exposure Investigation]?’’ asked ATSDR. ‘‘The activities simulated at the beaches at
IBSP pose no apparent public health hazard,’’ they declared.

In  an  interview  with  Subcommittee  staff  ATSDR’s  Mark  Johnson  acknowledged
that his agency did not include all of the suggestions submitted by the EPA officials.
It  is  an  ATSDR  document,  he  said,  and  the  ultimate  decision  of  what  is  in  the
health  consultation  rests  with  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Reg-
istry.  ATSDR  is  now  in  the  process  of  reviewing  new  sampling  data  of  the  beaches
and  expects  to  release  their  new  health  consultation  any  day,  according  to  ATSDR.

Depleted Uranium (DU) Contamination in Colonie, New York

Professor  Randall  R.  Parrish,  Ph.D.,  is  the  head  of  the  British  Geologic  Survey’s
Natural Environment Research Council’s (NERC) Isotope Geoscience Laboratories in
Nottingham,  England  and  Professor  of  Isotope  Geology  at  the  University  of  Leices-
ter.  In  2007  he  was  the  lead  author  of  a  peer-reviewed  journal  article  that  inves-
tigated depleted uranium (DU) inhalation exposures in Colonie, New York, home to
National  Lead,  Inc.,  which  produced  depleted  uranium  for  U.S.  military  munitions
from  1958  to  1984,  when  the  site  was  closed  due  to  violations  of  environmental
emission  standards.36 In  2006,  the  Federal  Government  completed  a  $190  million
cleanup of the site.

A 2004 ATSDR health consultation found that past emissions from the site ‘‘could
have  increased  the  risk  of  health  effects—especially  kidney  disease—for  people  liv-
ing  near  the  plant’’  and  found  that  ‘‘the  combination  of  inhaling  DU  dust  and  ciga-
rette  smoke  could  have  increased  the  risk  of  lung  cancer.’’  But  because  the  plant
had  ceased  operating,  ATSDR  concluded  that  there  was  ‘‘no  apparent  public  health
hazard.’’  In  addition,  they  rejected  a  request  to  conduct  a  health  survey  because
they said it would not ‘‘answer the community’s questions about whether or not the
NL  plant  impacted  their  health.’’37 In  2007,  however,  Professor  Parrish  and  re-
searchers  at  the  University  of  Albany—using  a  newly  developed  method—detected

DU  exposures  in  100  percent  of  the  former  workers  at  the  site  they  tested  and  20
percent of the residents they tested, in addition to DU in the soil found miles away
from the site.

Parrish’s paper said that the ‘‘ATSDR Health Consultation concluded that further
investigations were unjustified because it would be impossible to determine the inci-
dence of DU contamination after such a long period of time since the inhalation haz-
ard  no  longer  existed.’’  But  Parrish’s  paper  showed  it  was  possible  and  the  authors
recommended  that  ATSDR  do  a  follow-up  study  with  a  larger  group  of  nearby  resi-
dents  to  access  their  ‘‘potential  health  outcomes.’’  Although  ATSDR’s  mission  state-
ment says it ‘‘serves the public by using the best science,’’ scientists at ATSDR told
Subcommittee staff that they are unswayed by Professor Parrish’s findings and say
they  do  not  see  a  need  to  re-examine  the  Colonie,  New  York  residents  for  potential
DU  exposures.  They  say  that  the  amount  of  depleted  uranium  detected  in  the  resi-
dents was so small that it would not result in any health hazard, thereby confirming
the conclusions of their earlier health consultation. Professor Parrish says this argu-
ment does not take into account what these individuals were exposed to in the past.
Parrish  says  that  with  further  analysis  of  his  work  scientists  can  attempt  to  cal-
culate  the  cumulative  exposures  of  individuals  to  help  determine  what  their  expo-
sures were in the past and what the health risk to them might be today.

Vieques Island, Puerto Rico

For  years,  ATSDR  has  investigated  potential  environmental  hazards  on  and  off
the  coast  of  the  island  of  Vieques  in  Puerto  Rico.  The  U.S.  Navy  engaged  in  live
bombing  practice  activities  on  and  off  the  coast  of  Vieques  from  1941  to  2003
spreading munitions containing depleted uranium and other toxic chemicals into the
sea  and  local  ecosystem.  In  November  2003,  ATSDR  issued  a  summary  of  its  work
on  the  island.  ‘‘Residents  of  Vieques  have  not  been  exposed  to  harmful  levels  of
chemicals  resulting  from  Navy  training  activities  at  the  former  Live  Impact  Area,’’
ATSDR concluded. ‘‘It is safe to eat seafood from the coastal waters and near-shore
lands on Vieques,’’ they said.38

Many independent scientists and health experts question those findings. Most re-
cently, Professor James Porter, Associate Dean at the Odum School of Ecology, Uni-
versity  of  Georgia,  presented  findings  at  a  conference  last  month  that  found
unexploded  munitions  from  the  U.S.  Navy  around  the  island  were,  in  fact,  leaking
toxic cancer causing substances into the ocean endangering sea life. Professor Porter
found  that  sea  urchins  and  ‘‘feather  duster  worms’’  closest  to  unexploded  bombs  or
bomb fragments off the coast of Vieques had extraordinarily high toxic levels of var-
ious  chemicals.  Some  of  the  materials  were  nearly  100,000  times  over  established
safe  limits.  Professor  Porter  cautioned  that  he  performed  a  ‘‘point  source  study,’’
meaning  he  took  measurements  close  to  the  residual  bomb  materials  and  that
ATSDR  has  performed  ‘‘broad  spectrum’’  tests  that  measure  toxic  chemicals  in  a
much wider arena.

That explains the discrepancies in what Professor Porter found and what ATSDR
discovered.  Although  Professor  Porter  cautioned  that  it  is  still  unclear  what  sort  of
impact  these  toxins  have  had  on  the  dinner  plate  some  studies  have  shown  that
residents on Vieques Island have a 23 percent higher cancer rate than those on the
main  island  of  Puerto  Rico.39 Other  studies  have  found  that  plants  on  the  island
have  high  concentrations  of  lead,  mercury,  cadmium,  uranium,  cobalt,  manganese
and  aluminum.40 Vieques  residents  question  the  integrity  of  the  studies  conducted
by ATSDR, as do many Puerto Rican and other independent scientists.

Kelly Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas

18

Issuing  public  health  documents  that  fail  to  include  relevant  information,  are
based  on  incomplete  or  deficient  investigations,  or  omit  critical  public  health  data
can  contribute  to  the  environmental  exposure  of  the  public.  In  1999  an  ATSDR  re-
port  that  examined  cancer  incidence  around  the  Kelly  Air  Force  Base  in  San  Anto-
nio,  Texas,  found  increased  levels  of  liver  and  kidney  cancer  as  well  as  leukemia.41
But  none  of  ATSDR’s  studies  on  the  former  Air  Force  Base  linked  the  illnesses  to
the toxins from the base that have leached into these neighborhoods.

In a critique of the ATSDR report, Dr. Katherine Squibb, a toxicologist at the Uni-
versity of Maryland, found that the Agency’s conclusions were based on minimal in-
formation,  some  Air  Force  studies  ATSDR  relied  on  for  its  conclusions  failed  to
measure  important  exposure  pathways,  and  ATSDR  failed  to  conduct  an  adequate
assessment  of  whether  or  not  some  chemicals  migrated  off-base.  ‘‘It  is  questionable
as to whether ATSDR’s conclusion that no public exposure to contaminants occurred
through the domestic use of groundwater in the past is correct,’’ wrote Squibb.42

In  a  2002  critique  of  another  ATSDR  report  on  the  Kelly  Air  Force  Base,  Squibb
found that ATSDR did not evaluate cumulative risks of exposure for certain chemi-
cals.43 She also told a local reporter that ATSDR examined health risks from expo-
sure  to  soil  from  a  part  of  the  base  only  after  the  site  had  been  cleaned  up  and  re-
mediated.  ‘‘It  does  not  appear  that  ATSDR  has  considered  health  risks  associated
with soil that migrated from this site prior to remediation,’’ said Squibb.44

Seven  years  after  Dr.  Squibb’s  comments,  the  issues  of  off-site  contamination  at
Kelly  Air  Force  Base  were  still  swirling  around  the  local  community.  ‘‘I  don’t  know
much about science,’’ San Miguel, one local resident said last month, ‘‘but there are
13 homes on this block and 11 of those families have had someone die from cancer.
That is what is bothering me,’’ he said. ‘‘Where did that come from?’’45

Trichloroethylene (TCE) Groundwater Contamination in Elkhart, Indiana

Earlier  this  month,  ATSDR  released  a  draft  Public  Health  Assessment  (PHA)  on
groundwater  contamination  from  trichloroethylene  (TCE)  and  other  chemicals  at
what  is  known  as  the  Lusher  Avenue  Site  in  Elkhart,  Indiana.  Contamination  in
the  area  has  stretched  back  to  the  mid-1980s  and  last  year  EPA  designated  it  a
Superfund site and placed it on the National Priorities List (NPL). There are a num-
ber of potential sources of environmental pollution in the area including a rail yard,
pharmaceutical manufacturer, plastic and metal fabrication plants and a musical in-
strument  fabrication  facility.  The  area  has  a  population  of  2,597  people,  including
286 children six years old or younger.46

In  1989,  EPA  established  a  drinking  water  standard  or  Maximum  Contaminant
Level  (MCL)  for  TCE  of  five  parts-per-billion  (5  ppb).  Municipal  water  systems  are
required  to  test  water  for  TCE  concentrations  every  three  months.  If  any  levels  ex-
ceed the MCL, they are required to notify the public via newspapers, radio, TV net-
works  and  other  means  and  to  provide  alternative  drinking  water  supplies  to  the
public.47 In  the  past,  TCE  contamination  in  the  drinking  water  systems  in  Lusher
were discovered in many of the several hundred private wells in the area. Residents
were  provided  with  alternative  water  supplies  or  filtration  systems  were  installed.

A new round of sampling in 2005 and 2006 found some wells had TCE levels of up
to 700 ppb, exposing an estimated 200 people to these contaminants.

19

The  recent  ATSDR  health  assessment  concluded  that:  ‘‘Most  adverse  health  out-
comes are not anticipated at Lusher because the TCE concentration in most private
wells  is  less  than  100  ppb.’’ 48 However,  ATSDR’s  own  1997  Toxicological  Profile  on
trichloroethylene  cites  several  studies  showing  associations  between  exposures  to
much  lower  levels  of  TCE  exposure  and  health  effects,  such  as  neural  tube  defects,
for  instance.49 In  addition,  it  cites  another  study  of  residents  in  Tucson,  Arizona
that  were  exposed  to  TCE  levels  between  six  and  239  ppb.  The  study  found  that
the  children  of  mothers  who  lived  in  this  area  in  their  first  trimester  of  pregnancy
were  two  and  one-half  times  more  likely  to  develop  congenital  heart  defects  than
children of mothers not exposed to TCE during pregnancy.50 Yet, the ATSDR health
assessment  says  that  there  have  been  exposures  at  the  Lusher  site  as  high  as  700
ppb,  ‘‘However,  most  TCE  exposures  at  Lusher  were  and  are  less  than  100  ppb  and
indicate little to no risk for heart defects in newborns.’’ [Emphasis in the original].51
The  ATSDR  assessment  does  say:  ‘‘People  drinking  well  water  which  contains
TCE  at  levels  greater  than  300  ppb  have  an  increased  risk  of  developing  cancer.’’
It  bases  this  assertion  on  another  ATSDR  study  that  examined  a  cancer  cluster  in
Woburn,  Massachusetts  in  1986  and  found  that  there  were  more  than  twice  as
many  childhood  cases  of  leukemia  as  expected  while  the  TCE  contamination  in  the
water  was  only  267  ppb.  How  ATSDR  now  justifies  asserting  that  there  is  no  in-
creased  risk  of  cancer  below  300  ppb  or  that  there  is  no  risk  of  heart  defects  in
newborns  from  the  exposures  in  Lusher  appears  to  be  scientifically  unfounded  and
misleading.52

The  Public  Health  Assessment  also  failed  to  mention  a  1994  study  cited  in
ATSDR’s  own  Toxicological  Profile  of  trichloroethylene.  The  study  found  that  in  a
review  of  1.5  million  residents  in  75  towns  monitored  for  TCE  levels  between  1979
and  1987,  females  exposed  to  drinking  water  in  excess  of  the  EPA  maximum  con-
taminant  level  (MCL)  of  five  ppb  had  a  significant  elevation  of  total  leukemias,  in-
cluding  childhood  leukemias,  acute  lymphatic  leukemias,  and  non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma.  The  recent  ATSDR  report  also  failed  to  mention  that  a  1996  study  by
the  Massachusetts  Department  of  Health  found  that  the  risk  of  leukemia  in  the
group  of  Woburn,  Massachusetts  women  exposed  to  TCE  in  utero  were  eight  times
higher than a control group.53

While  none  of  these  studies  in  and  of  themselves  are  conclusive  evidence  of  clear
links  between  TCE  exposures  and  these  specific  health  problems,  they  are  part  of
the  scientific  public  health  record  on  these  issues.  Omitting  them  from  a  public
health document that is trying to assess the public health threats from TCE to the
community in and around the Lusher site appears short-sighted at best and scientif-
ically misleading.

In the end, ATSDR’s conclusions on the Lusher site seem fuzzy at best. Inconsist-
encies  in  other  ATSDR  reports  have  been  a  long  standing  frustration  by  both  local
communities and other federal agencies, particularly EPA. In its conclusions on the
Lusher site, for instance, ATSDR wrote: ‘‘ATSDR categorizes the site as a past pub-
lic  health  hazard.  Due  to  uncertainties  concerning  sources,  continuing  migration  of
contaminants,  and  private  well  use,  the  site  could  pose  a  future  public  health  haz-
ard.  Currently,  exposure  has  been  mitigated  or  lessened  through  provision  of  alter-
nate water and filter systems for private well users with contaminated water. How-
ever, there may be private wells that still need to be tested.’’ 54 Until ATSDR begins
to  focus  on  the  scientific  integrity  and  basic  clarity  of  its  public  health  documents
with  renewed  energy,  care  and  focus  the  Agency  will  continue  to  be  mired  down  in
problems and garner distrust from the local communities it is supposed to serve.

Dr. Frumkin’s National Conversation

20

In  recent  weeks  Dr.  Frumkin  has  unveiled  an  NCEH/ATSDR  initiative  he  calls:
‘‘The  National  Conversation  on  Public  Health  and  Chemical  Exposures.’’  He  has
grand  plans.  ‘‘[N]ow  is  an  opportune  time  to  revitalize  the  public  health  approach
to chemical exposures,’’ he wrote recently in the Journal of Environmental Health.55
As  part  of  this  effort  he  wants  to  have  a  broad  dialogue  that  aims  to  identify  gaps
in  the  public  health  approach  to  chemical  exposures  and  identify  solutions  for
strengthening the public health approach to chemical exposures.

Dr. Frumkin has held several internal ATSDR ‘‘all hands meetings’’ where he has
briefed  agency  employees  on  his  initiative  and  he  organized  a  small  meeting  in
Washington,  D.C.  on  Friday,  March  6th  with  environmental  organizations.  He  has
personally  met  with  many  public  health  and  environmental  groups  in  an  attempt
to drum up support for his initiative.

A  few  weeks  ago  he  met  with  Stephen  Lester,  Science  Director  of  the  Center  for
Health,  Environment  and  Justice  and  its  Executive  Director,  Lois  Gibbs,  the  local
activist from Love Canal in New York who spearheaded an environmental investiga-
tion when she discovered her children’s elementary school was built on a toxic waste
dump. Dr. Frumkin was apparently seeking advice on how to help reorganize or re-
form ATSDR to make it more responsive to the concerns of local communities. Les-
ter told him that all he needed to do was follow the recommendations he and other
local  community  groups  gave  to  ATSDR  back  in  1990.  Virtually  nothing  has
changed,  Lester  says.  The  problems,  as  well  as  many  of  the  solutions,  remain  the
same.  Lester  had  been  through  this  once  before  and  is  not  very  hopeful  that  any
real change will come to the Agency.

For a twelve-year period from 1986 to 1998, Dr. Barry Johnson served as the As-
sistant Administrator of ATSDR and by all accounts he was a deeply dedicated and
compassionate public servant. In 1990 he attempted to reach out to local community
groups  to  begin  a  dialogue  in  order  to  help  rectify  the  Agency’s  poor  image  and  to
move  the  Agency  into  a  new  direction,  producing  scientifically  valid  studies,  identi-
fying causes of environmental contamination causing harm to human health and ob-
taining  the  respect  and  trust  of  the  local  communities  ATSDR  is  supposed  to  pro-
tect.  Dr.  Johnson  had  contacted  the  Center  for  Health,  Environment  and  Justice
(then  called  the  Citizen’s  Clearinghouse  for  Hazardous  Wastes).  Because  of  Lois
Gibbs’  presence,  the  organization  had  clout  with  many  local  environmental  groups
and communities.

There  were  several  meetings  between  ATSDR  and  local  community  groups  as  a
result of Barry Johnson’s organizing efforts. The groups produced a long-list of prob-
lems, observations and recommendations. Many of them seem to have withstood the
test of time and are equally relevant and significant today. ‘‘Health officials look for
every  possible  reason  other  than  the  obvious  as  the  causative  factor  in  evaluating
health  problems.’’  ‘‘Studies  do  not  address  problems  and  do  not  lead  to  action;  in-
stead they seem to look for ways to dismiss problems.’’ One asked: ‘‘Is there a need
for  ATSDR?  Should  ATSDR  exist  given  that  it  is  not  providing  what  citizens  want
and need.’’ 56

The  momentum  from  those  meetings  soon  faded.  Four  years  later  Lester  wrote:
‘‘Today  we  continue  to  see  many  of  the  same  investigation  strategies  that  ATSDR
and  CDC  has  been  using  for  years—investigating  health  problems  with  scientific
methods  that  are  highly  questionable  and  inappropriate.  They  consistently  ask  the
wrong  questions,  use  inappropriate  comparison  groups,  dilute  exposed  populations
with  unexposed  populations,  eliminate  exposed  people  from  their  studies  and  use
other  ill-conceived  scientific  methods  to  evaluate  health  problems  in  communities.
In the end, they find no health problems because they used methods destined to fail
from  the  beginning  and  because  their  studies  are  often  ‘‘inconclusive  by  design.’’ 57
The  integrity  of  the  data  ATSDR  produces  is  critical  to  gaining  the  public’s  trust
and  successfully  addressing  important  environmental  public  health  issues.  These
flawed reports have very direct impacts on the safety and health of the public. The
public  health  documents  emanating  from  ATSDR  should  adhere  to  a  clear,  con-
sistent  and  scientifically  credible  and  defensible  standard.  Yet,  in  far  too  many  in-
stances that is not the case.

ATSDR’s Leadership Today

21

Many  of  the  challenges  that  ATSDR  faces  every  day  are  not  simple.  Accurately
assessing  public  health  implications  from  environmental  contamination  is  difficult.
The  state  of  the  science  may  not  be  able  to  determine  the  exact  cause  of  a  cluster
of  illnesses  no  matter  how  many  hours  are  invested  or  how  high  a  priority  inves-
tigating  the  issue  is  to  ATSDR,  a  local  community  or  anyone  else.  But  these  are
not  now,  nor  have  they  ever  been  the  criticisms  that  have  been  leveled  against  the
Agency. The criticisms swirl around the simple mistakes, the careless research, the
critical  scientific  omissions,  the  poorly  contrived  methods  used  by  the  Agency  to
identify  the  cause  of  a  community’s  public  health  concerns  and  the  lack  of  appro-
priate fundamental agency policies, such as having a thorough and independent re-
view of ATSDR’s public health documents before they are released to the public.

None of these problems will ever evaporate or disappear until ATSDR has strong
leaders  who  are  committed  to  ensuring  that  the  Agency  fulfills  its  mission  and  at
the  same  time  creates  a  public  health  culture  that  is  bolstered  by  sound  science,
careful  review  and  an  eagerness  to  actually  identify  the  potential  environmental
causes  of  illnesses,  ailments  or  diseases  that  impact  local  communities  and  affect
their  health  and  safety.  The  problems  that  embroil  ATSDR  have  been  present  for
many years and did not simply emerge under the leadership of Dr. Frumkin.

However,  it  is  apparent  from  both  Dr.  Frumkin’s  handling  of  the  formaldehyde
issue  as  well  as  other  incidents  that  Dr.  Frumkin’s  actions  have  contributed  to  a
culture where scientific integrity appears to take a back seat to political expediency
and uncomplicated conclusions regardless of their accuracy or potential impact upon
the  public’s  health.  As  the  Subcommittee  said  in  its  staff  report  on  formaldehyde
last year: ‘‘It seems unlikely that ATSDR will be capable of fulfilling its core mission
of  protecting  the  public  health  until  they  have  capable  leaders  willing  and  able  to
lead  the  Agency  and  serve  the  public.’’  The  cases  below  all  reveal  the  approach
taken by the current leadership and their commitment to scientific integrity.

Camp Lejeune, North Carolina

In 1990 ATSDR published a public health assessment that showed a dry-cleaning
facility  just  outside  of  Camp  Lejeune  in  North  Carolina  had  inappropriately  dis-
posed  of  trichloroethylene  (TCE)  which  contaminated  the  base’s  water  supply.58 In
1997 ATSDR wrote a public health assessment on the potential environmental expo-
sures  of  U.S.  military  personnel  and  veterans  who  had  served  at  Camp  Lejeune  in
North Carolina and were potentially exposed to TCEs and a host of other toxic sub-
stances.59 The  report,  based  on  flawed  data  that  was  available  at  the  time,  showed
that the levels of exposures believed to have occurred would not pose a health haz-
ard for adults. But it did recommend a follow-up study to evaluate potential health
effects  to  mothers  exposed  during  pregnancy  and  their  children.60 ATSDR  has  con-
ducted numerous health studies on Camp Lejeune since then.61

In 2003 a Camp Lejeune veteran wrote to the Department of Health and Human
Services  requesting  records  referenced  in  ATSDR’s  1997  public  health  assessment
on  Camp  Lejeunne  under  a  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  request.  The  re-
sponse he got back said the records ‘‘are no longer in CDC’s possession. Specifically,
the records were lost during a 1998 office move,’’ an HHS official wrote. ‘‘As a result,
CDC no longer has records that would respond to your request, other than the pub-
lic  health  assessment  itself.’’ 62 However,  an  ATSDR  FOIA  officer  offered  a  slightly
different  explanation.  On  June  2,  2003,  she  wrote,  ‘‘A  search  of  our  record  failed  to
reveal any documents pertaining to your request. Program staff stated that the ref-

Finally,  Dr.  Frumkin  responded  to  Camp  Lejeunne  veteran  and  activist  Jerry
Ensminger about the FOIA responses and the validity of the 1997 Public Health As-
sessment  on  May  4,  2007.  ‘‘As  a  scientific  public  health  agency,  it  is  important  to
us  that  our  reports  contain  the  most  current  and  scientifically  correct  information
available  at  the  time,’’  wrote  Dr.  Frumkin.  ‘‘We  acknowledge  that  the  references
used for the development of the 1997 public health assessment are no longer avail-
able  in  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry’s  (ATSDR)  files.  A
move of ATSDR staff resulted in our files of Camp Lejeune-related documents being
temporarily  relocated.  A  private  contractor  mistakenly  disposed  of  the  documents,’’
said Dr. Frumkin. ‘‘Although unfortunate that the material referenced in the public
health  assessment  is  no  longer  available  in  ATSDR’s  files,  the  original  information
and  data,  with  the  exception  of  original  ATSDR  references,  may  still  be  available
from their original sources.’’

Mr. Ensminger legitimately questions how the leader of a federal scientific public
health agency can stand behind a document which contains no supporting informa-
tion  or  data.  He  is  particularly  perturbed  by  how  cavalier  Dr.  Frumkin  has  been
to this and other critical public health issues. The impact of ATSDR’s work has real-
world  implications  for  U.S.  Veterans  and  other  members  of  the  public.  In  this  in-
stance,  the  U.S.  Veterans  Administration  has  specifically  cited  the  flawed  ATSDR
public health assessment to deny at least one veteran medical benefit’s for illnesses
they  believe  were  due  to  toxic  exposures  while  based  at  Camp  Lejeune  on  several
occasions.64

Brush Wellman, Elmore, Ohio—Beryllium Tests

However, in some instances it is clear that Dr. Frumkin and his deputy Dr. Tom
Sinks  have  intentionally  tried  to  diminish  the  scope  and  integrity  of  some  of  the
Agency’s  health  consultations.  In  one  investigation  that  examined  potential  expo-
sures  to  beryllium  in  Elmore,  Ohio,  Dr.  Frumkin  and  Dr.  Sinks  clearly  prevented
ATSDR  staff  from  more  adequately  informing  the  local  community  about  the  avail-
ability  of  free  blood  tests  in  order  to  test  them  for  potential  exposure.  Publicly,
ATSDR  said  that  it  offered  up  to  200  free  tests  but  that  only  about  20  individuals
responded.  But  internally,  e-mails  obtained  by  the  Subcommittee  show  that  Dr.
Frumkin and Dr. Sinks intentionally limited advertising the availability of the tests
despite strong and repeated arguments from some ATSDR staff scientists.

In February 2006, Dr. Dan Middleton was finally at wits end. In an e-mail to Dr.
Sinks,  in  which  Dr.  Frumkin  and  others  were  copied  he  wrote:  ‘‘After  a  prolonged
struggle to bring this investigation forward and innumerable revisions, I find myself
at  a  loss  as  to  how  to  proceed—I  cannot  in  good  conscience  lead  an  investigation
that  has  little  chance  of  success.’’  Middleton  said  he  would  like  to  resolve  the  issue
constructively and suggested a meeting with Dr. Frumkin and Dr. Sinks.65

But Dr. Frumkin’s reply to Dr. Sinks about the e-mail was less than encouraging.
‘‘Tom:  Dan  is  probably  right.  We  need  a  meeting.  This  is  because  he  clearly  hasn’t
gotten  the  message.  This  study  is  OFF.  There  will  not  be  a  study  along  the  lines
Dan has contemplated. There will be a limited clinical service offered to those (prob-
ably  few)  members  of  the  community  who  want  it.  That  service  will  consist  of  a
blood  test  to  look  for  beryllium  sensitization  among  eligible  persons.  The  outcome
will  be  this:  people  who  are  sensitized  will  be  informed  of  that  fact  (as  will  those
who are not sensitized), and if they wish their doctors will also be informed. We will
provide  information  to  local  doctors  to  help  them  interpret  and  act  on  the  results.
With that we will be done. Period. Howie.’’ 66

In mid-June, 2006 Dr. Middleton attempted to gain permission from Dr. Sinks to
specifically  inform  workers  in  one  local  machine  shop  about  the  beryllium  tests.
‘‘Isn’t  it  the  right  thing  to  do?’’  Dr.  Middleton  asked.67 In  his  e-mail  response,  Dr.

Sinks  wrote:  ‘‘good  try—no.  Let’s  run  the  advertisement.  It  will  include  machinists
and they may call us.’’ 68

In  the  end,  only  a  small  number  of  individuals  asked  to  be  tested.  A  week  later,
Dr. Sinks was informed by Dr. Middleton that they had completed 27 interviews for
the  test  and  that  21  people  are  eligible.69 Dr.  Sinks  then  forwarded  the  e-mail  to
Dr.  Frumkin  with  the  subject  line:  ‘‘beryllium  testing’’  saying  ‘‘pretty  good  guess!’’
Dr.  Frumkin’s  reply  to  Dr.  Sinks,  ‘‘Wow.  I  think  20  was  our  estimate,  no?’’ 70 The
Subcommittee investigated the beryllium issue last year.71

The design of any scientific study is a critical element in determining the validity
of  its  outcome  and  ability  of  the  study  to  identify  a  problem.  Until  ATSDR  has
strong  dedicated  leaders  who  are  more  concerned  about  the  integrity  of  the  reports
the  Agency  produces  than  the  potential  backlash  the  Agency  may  receive  from  cor-
porations,  federal  agencies  or  local  environmental  groups  unhappy  or  dissatisfied
with  the  results  of  their  work  ATSDR  will  never  gain  the  public’s  trust  or  the  con-
fidence of independent scientists and public health professionals.

Lead in Washington, D.C.’s Drinking Water

Based on almost two years of work, it is the Subcommittee’s staff’s conclusion that
Dr. Frumkin has shown a laissez-faire attitude towards the scientific integrity of the
documents and data his agency relies upon to make critical public health decisions.
In several instances he has appeared to be more inclined to defend the agencies he
directs,  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry  (ATSDR)  as  well  as
the  CDC’s  National  Center  for  Environmental  Health  (NCEH),  than  protecting  the
public’s  health  by  diligently  investigating  and  analyzing  potential  public  health
threats  based  upon  sound  scientific  procedures  and  methods.  His  inexcusable  de-
fense of the Agency’s actions in the formaldehyde issue is perhaps the most glaring
example, but there have been others.

In 2002 a change in the drinking water filtration system in Washington, D.C. led
to  a  sharp  increase  in  the  levels  of  lead  in  the  city’s  drinking  water.  This  spike
which  may  have  presented  a  health  hazard  to  city  residents  was  not  reported  by
the  Washington  D.C.  Water  and  Sewer  Authority  (WASA)  or  the  Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA). By early 2004 tests indicated that most homes tested had
water  lead  levels  above  EPA’s  recommended  level  of  15  parts  per  billion  (ppb).  The
public first became aware of the high lead levels in a 2004 story in The Washington
Post.72

In  March  2004,  scientists  at  the  CDC’s  National  Center  for  Environmental
Health,  which  Dr.  Frumkin  came  to  lead  the  following  year,  reported  that  of  201
residents from 98 homes with high water lead levels they tested, none of them had
lead  levels  in  their  blood  that  reached  a  ‘‘level  of  concern.’’ 73 Most  people  inter-
preted  this  CDC  report  as  claiming  that  there  was  no  health  threat  from  drinking
Washington,  D.C.’s  water.  A  WASA  fact-sheet  in  February  2008,  for  instance,  said:
‘‘According  to  the  CDC  report,  there  were  no  children,  from  a  sample  group  of  201,
identified  with  blood  lead  levels  above  the  CDC  level  of  concern  (>10  micrograms/
deciliter)  that  were  not  explained  by  other  sources,  primarily  the  conditions  of  the
household paint.’’ 74

But  last  month  a  peer-reviewed  paper  was  released  by  Marc  Edward,  a  civil  and
environmental  engineering  professor  at  Virginia  Tech  and  collaborators  at  Chil-
dren’s  National  Medical  Center  that  showed,  in  fact,  children  in  D.C.  clearly  had
high levels of lead in there blood as a result of the D.C. water crisis. They also found
that  50  percent  of  the  data  CDC  relied  on  from  the  D.C.  Department  of  Health  re-

garding  the  blood  tests  and  water  lead  levels  was  flawed.75 In  addition,  it  was  dis-
covered that more than 6,500 blood tests for a critical period in 2003 and 2004 were
lost. Still, Dr. Frumkin told a reporter for Environmental Science & Technology, the
journal  where  the  article  was  published,  that  even  if  the  data  used  for  the  CDC
analysis  was  deeply  flawed  it  would  not  impact  the  CDC’s  conclusions.  ‘‘No  public-
health database is perfect,’’ he said. ‘‘But this database is not so flawed that it fails.
We  did  a  sensitivity  analysis  to  see  what  happens  if  data  are  misclassified.  That
sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  there  would  need  to  be  a  very  large  amount  of  data
misclassification to alter the conclusions of the study,’’ argued Frumkin.76

Dr.  Frumkin’s  statement  that  a  ‘‘sensitivity  analysis’’  showed  that  even  flawed
data would not change the conclusions of the CDC report struck Professor Marc Ed-
wards as incredible for the leader of a public health agency. Professor Edwards says
considering half of the data had flaws in it, it seems highly unlikely that those flaws
did  not  impact  the  CDC’s  findings.  He  says  his  new  report  clearly  shows  that  the
data and therefore CDC’s conclusions were wrong. Dr. Frumkin and the CDC began
to  back  away  from  their  initial  claims  that  were  widely  interpreted  to  mean  the
drinking water was safe.

In  the  aftermath  of  the  criticism  of  the  CDC  report,  Dr.  Frumkin  said  the  report
had  a  ‘‘clear  message,’’  that  ‘‘there  is  no  threshold  for  lead  exposure.’’  Edwards,  a
civil  and  environmental  engineering  Professor  was  named  a  MacArthur  Fellow  last
summer  by  the  John  D.  and  Catherine  T.  MacArthur  Foundation  and  granted
$500,000  (often  called  a  ‘‘Genius  Grant’’)  to  study  drinking  water  safety  issues.  Ed-
wards has written several letters to the CDC alleging ‘‘possible scientific misconduct
by CDC Scientists and Officials’’ regarding the D.C. lead—drinking water issue. He
has not named Dr. Frumkin in these complaints.

But  Dr.  Frumkin’s  public  response  to  his  involvement  in  the  D.C.  lead  drinking
water  issue  is  remarkably  similar  to  his  actions  and  inactions  undertaken  during
ATSDR’s  response  to  the  formaldehyde  issue.  In  that  instance,  he  argued,  after
being confronted by Congress that it was not his agency’s fault for issuing a deeply
flawed  health  consultation,  but  FEMA’s  fault  for  ‘‘misinterpreting’’  the  data  in  the
undeniably  flawed  report.  On  the  D.C.  lead  issue,  Dr.  Frumkin  e-mailed  Ralph
Scott, the Community Project Director for the Alliance for Healthy Homes, on Mon-
day, February 16, 2009 and said: ‘‘In the Post article of February 11, WASA General
Manager Jerry Johnson attributed to CDC the view that ‘‘residents’ health had not
been  affected’’  by  elevated  lead  levels  in  DC’s  water  supply  from  2001  to  2004.  As
I  am  sure  you  agree,  this  persistent  misstatement  by  WASA  is  regrettable,’’  wrote
Dr.  Frumkin.  He  then  went  on  to  defend  the  CDC  report  on  D.C.’s  lead  level  in
drinking water saying the report actually said no levels of lead are safe for children.
Like the formaldehyde report, the CDC report was simply ‘‘misinterpreted’’ by the
public  and  apparently  officials  at  the  D.C.  Water  and  Sewer  Authority,  according
to  Dr.  Frumkin.  And  like  the  formaldehyde  report,  the  CDC  report  on  lead  levels
in  D.C.’s  drinking  water  has  had  health  related  consequences.  School  officials  in
New York and Seattle have cited the flawed CDC report as justification for not ap-
propriately responding to high levels of lead in their water, for instance. Congress’s
investigative arm, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) also cited the flawed
CDC  report  and  the  Congressional  Research  Service  (CRS)  used  the  flawed  data  in
the  CDC  report  because  they  believed  it  was  scientifically  sound  and  accurate.
‘‘None  of  the  201  persons  tested  who  live  in  homes  with  the  highest  levels  of  lead
in  drinking  water  (i.e.,  above  300  ppb)  had  blood  lead  levels  above  CDC’s  levels  of
concern,’’ the CRS report said.77 But Professor Edwards’ paper now shows that that
conclusion was based on flawed data and is wrong.

Scientific Integrity?

For  a  public  health  agency  whose  mission  is  to  protect  the  health  of  the  public
from toxic chemicals, the integrity of the science upon which ATSDR bases their de-
cisions  and  the  scientific  integrity  of  the  public  health  documents  they  release  to
the public should be sacrosanct. But in its investigations of how ATSDR’s leadership
handled  its  health  consultation  on  formaldehyde  for  FEMA  last  year  the  Sub-

committee  found  a  haphazard  approach  to  clearing,  vetting  and  approving  the  re-
lease  of  its  public  health  documents.  In  addition,  there  was  an  astounding  absence
of  independent  scientific  review  of  documents  that  are  supposed  to  play  a  critical
role  in  protecting  the  public’s  health  and  in  establishing  an  appropriate  federal  re-
sponse  to  environmentally  threatened  communities.78 Largely  in  response  to  the
Subcommittee’s investigation Dr. Frumkin asked ATSDR’s Board of Scientific Coun-
selors to examine the Agency’s ‘‘Peer Review and Clearance Policies and Practices.’’
The board issued a draft report last October.

The  Agency’s  Office  of  Science,  in  charge  of  clearing  agency  documents  for  public
release,  has  a  small  staff  and  an  enormous  volume  of  documents  it  is  supposed  to
clear,  the  board’s  report  said.  As  a  result,  it  lacks  the  ability  to  provide  in  depth
scientific  expertise  to  review  many  documents.  Several  people  told  the  board  that
they  were  concerned  that  the  reviews  that  took  place  above  the  division  level  were
‘‘cursory.’’ In addition, the board wrote that ‘‘scientists expressed concern that in try-
ing  to  achieve  its  objectives,  the  Office  of  Communication  Science’s  wordsmithing
can  change  the  intended  scientific  message  in  a  document.’’  The  board  also  found
that  there  is  no  clearly  written  guidance  on  what  documents  should  be  submitted
for external peer-review.

But the Board of Scientific Counselors was severely hampered in its review. Inter-
views were conducted with groups not individuals, for instance. ‘‘[S]ome participants
may have felt constrained in offering their frank opinions,’’ the board acknowledged.
The  board  also  recognized  that  it  received  ‘‘primarily  a  management  perspective’’
and did not gather much insight into the concerns or worries of staff scientists. ‘‘Ap-
proximately  24  managers/team  leaders  and  seven  staff  scientists  were  interviewed
across the three panels,’’ according to the board’s report. ‘‘Moreover, only one agency
employee attended the open session for walk-in comments,’’ the report says.

In fact, it seems to the Subcommittee staff that the major focus of the board’s re-
view,  initiated  at  the  direction  of  Dr.  Howard  Frumkin,  received  an  inevitably
skewed  assessment  of  these  issues.  It  is  unclear  if  the  board  received  an  accurate
portrayal  of  how  ATSDR’s  public  health  documents  are  vetted  and  released  to  the
public  by  not  hearing  from  the  staff  scientists  and  other  ATSDR  employees  who
have expressed deep and wide-ranging concerns about this issue for a long time. The
fact  that  a  single  employee  showed  up  for  the  board’s  ‘‘open  session’’  suggests  that
a  large  cadre  of  these  scientists  remains  fearful  about  raising  critical  issues  with
ATSDR’s  leadership  involving  the  scientific  integrity  of  the  Agency’s  public  health
documents and perceived flaws in the scientific design and methodology used to in-
vestigate  potential  public  health  hazards.  In  the  past  year,  for  instance,  the  Sub-
committee has received numerous communications from ATSDR staff scientists who
have  raised  serious  concerns  about  the  willingness,  ability  and  desire  of  ATSDR’s
leaders  to  ensure  that  only  well  vetted  public  health  documents  based  on  scientif-
ically defensible positions and assumptions are released to the public.

Conclusion

Protecting  the  public’s  health  from  potential  exposures  to  toxic  substances  is  not
an  easy  task.  It  can  be  scientifically  challenging,  time  consuming  and  resource  in-
tensive.  The  Subcommittee  staff  suggests  that  legislative  fixes  may  be  necessary  to
address  long-standing  structural,  procedural  and  technical  issues  that  appear  to
have  hampered  ATSDR’s  effectiveness  and  harmed  the  communities  it  is  supposed
to protect.

But  more  than  anything,  it  is  apparent  that  no  fundamental  changes  will  occur
until  the  nearly  thousand  employees  at  the  NCEH  and  ATSDR,  the  vast  majority
of  whom  are  truly  dedicated  and  committed  to  protecting  the  public’s  health,  have
leadership  that  they  can  follow.  The  longer  ATSDR  continues  to  pursue  its  role  in
protecting  the  public’s  health  as  it  has  for  the  past  three  decades,  issuing  deeply
flawed  scientific  reports,  not  responding  to  the  concerns  of  local  communities  and
approaching  potential  environmental  exposures  with  a  mindset  that  endeavors  to
disprove  any  link  between  the  public’s  ill-health  effects  and  potential  exposures  to
environmental contaminants or toxins, the more people will suffer. After four years
leading ATSDR, not only has Dr. Frumkin taken no effective steps to confront those
issues,  on  some  specific  cases  he  has  contributed  to  the  problems  detailed  in  this
staff report. In many instances, ATSDR seems to represent a clear and present dan-
ger  to  the  public’s  health  rather  than  a  strong  advocate  and  sound  scientific  body

Chair MILLER. Dr. Broun, the Ranking Member.
Mr. BROUN. I thank the Chair.
Good  morning.  I  want  to  welcome  the  witnesses  here  today  and
thank  the  Chair  for  holding  this  hearing.  I  share  the  Chair’s  con-
cern  with  public  health  and  safety  issues  not  only  as  a  legislator
but  also  as  a  physician  and  a  scientist.  Our  constituents  deserve
to know whether their families are being exposed to harmful levels
of toxic chemicals.

As the Chair noted, ATSDR is no stranger to this committee. The
Subcommittee’s previous inquiry into the health consultation report
for  FEMA  regarding  formaldehyde  in  trailers  and  the  Agency’s
work  regarding  toxic  releases  into  the  Great  Lakes  region  pointed
to weaknesses in ATSDR’s scientific review process as well as how
they  convey  information  to  the  public.  Because  of  these  concerns,
ATSDR  initiated  several  internal  reviews  of  these  efforts  and  the
Committee  asked  GAO  to  review  the  Agency’s  processes.  Dr.
Frumkin  will  update  us  on  his  agency’s  efforts  today,  but  we  will
have to wait for GAO’s results for a few months. Until then, I hope
the  witnesses  here  today  can  help  this  committee  and  the  general
public better understand the Agency’s original mandate and how it
has  evolved  since  its  inception,  the  public’s  expectations  for  the
Agency  and  the  effects  of  an  increasing  number  of  petitions  to  the
Agency.

Understanding and communicating these fundamental points are
the first steps in evaluating the effectiveness of ATSDR. While the
work  of  the  Agency  is  critically  important,  it  is  also  very  difficult.
Determining  causation  and  making  health  risk  determinations  is
not  always  black  and  white.  Despite  the  complexity  of  their  work,

the  public  deserves  to  have  an  agency  that  they  can  trust.  The
issues that we discuss today are not simply academic.

Much  like  the  witnesses  on  the  first  panel  today,  many  of  my
constituents  turn  to  ATSDR  for  answers  about  the  effects  on  their
local  environment  and  on  their  families’  health.  Recently,  Jill
McElheney,  a  constituent  of  mine,  contacted  me  regarding  her  ex-
periences  with  ATSDR,  the  EPA  and  the  State  of  Georgia.  The
heartbreaking story of her son’s battle with childhood leukemia and
the  possibility  that  chemicals  from  a  nearby  industrial  facility
could have influenced his condition is cause enough for all of us to
take notice.

I  hope  this  hearing  will  help  us  shed  light  not  only  on  how  the
Agency  can  better  protect  public  health  and  safety  but  also  how  it
can  adapt  to  its  evolving  mission  and  the  appropriateness  of  this
evolution.  Additionally,  I  hope  the  witnesses  can  help  us  under-
stand  how  the  Agency  can  better  coordinate  with  community  orga-
nizations,  other  executive  branch  agencies  and  State  and  local  de-
partments  of  health  as  well  as  other  government  facilities  on  the
State  and  local  level.  Aside  from  assuring  the  science  is  always  at
the center of the Agency’s work, understanding expectations and ef-
fectively communicating with the public is key to making sure that
ATSDR is an effective agency in the future.

In  closing,  I  want  to  thank  our  witnesses  for  appearing  here

today as well as all the hardworking folks at ATSDR.

Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I yield back the rest of my time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE PAUL C. BROUN

Good morning. I want to welcome our witnesses here today, and thank the Chair-
man for holding this hearing. I share the Chairman’s concern with public health and
safety  issues,  not  only  as  a  legislator,  but  also  as  a  physician.  Our  constituents  de-
serve  to  know  whether  their  families  are  being  exposed  to  harmful  levels  of  toxic
chemicals.

As  the  Chairman  noted,  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry
(ATSDR) is no stranger to this committee. The Subcommittee’s previous inquiry into
the  health  consultation  report  for  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency
(FEMA)  regarding  formaldehyde  in  trailers,  and  the  Agency’s  work  regarding  toxic
releases in the Great Lakes Region, pointed to weaknesses in ATSDR’s scientific re-
view process as well as how they convey information to the public.

Because  of  these  concerns,  ATSDR  initiated  internal  reviews  of  these  efforts  and
the  Committee  tasked  GAO  to  review  the  Agency’s  processes.  Dr.  Frumkin  will  up-
date  us  on  his  Agency’s  efforts  today,  but  we  will  have  to  wait  for  GAO’s  results
for a few more months.

Until then, I hope the witnesses here today can help this committee, and the gen-

eral public, better understand:

• the  Agency’s  original  mandate  and  how  that  has  evolved  since  it’s  inception,
• the public’s expectations for the Agency, and
• the effects of increasing numbers of petitions to the Agency.

Understanding  and  communicating  these  fundamental  points  are  the  first  steps
in  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  ATSDR.  While  the  work  the  Agency  does  is  cru-

dustrial  facility  could  have  influenced  his  condition  is  cause  enough  for  all  of  us  to
take notice.

I hope this hearing will help us shed light not only on how the Agency can better
protect  public  health  and  safety,  but  also  how  it  can  adapt  to  its  evolving  mission,
and  the  appropriateness  of  this  evolution.  Additionally,  I  hope  the  witnesses  can
help us understand how the Agency can better coordinate with community organiza-
tions,  other  Executive  Branch  Agencies,  and  State  and  local  health  departments.
Aside  from  ensuring  that  science  is  always  at  the  center  of  the  Agency’s  work,  un-
derstanding  expectations  and  effectively  communicating  with  the  public  is  key  to
making sure ATSDR is an effective agency in the future.

In closing, I want to thank our witnesses for appearing here today, as well as all
the  hard-working  folks  at  ATSDR.  Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield  back  the  rest
of my time.

Chair  MILLER.  Thank  you,  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with
Dr. Broun on this committee. I welcome his expertise, his scientific
expertise,  and  if  I  was  able  to  get  along  with  Mr.  Sensenbrenner,
I certainly think I can get along with Dr. Broun.

Mr. BROUN. I look forward to working with the Chair. There are
some  theoretical  scientists  on  our  scientific  committee  that  don’t
think that physicians are scientists but I will take exception to that
because  we  do  scientific  theory,  et  cetera,  and  I  appreciate  the  op-
portunity of working with the Chair.

Chair MILLER. As a recovering lawyer, I am certainly in no posi-
tion  to  sneer  at  your  scientific  credentials.  I  will  certainly  accept
you as a scientist.

I  understand  Mr.  Wilson  has  no  opening  statement  but  we  will
accept  opening  statements  for  the  record  without  objection  that
may be included later.

[The prepared statement of Chair Gordon follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIR BART GORDON

I  want  to  thank  Mr.  Miller  for  calling  this  hearing.  This  subcommittee  has  done
good work in keeping the pressure on the Centers for Disease Control and the Agen-
cy for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to get the science right when
protecting the public’s health.

Chemicals of all kinds pollute our water, our air, our soil, and also enter the food

chain. Some are benign and some are dangerous.

For a community that has had a toxic spill or long-standing pollution issues, wor-
rying that you or your family may get sick because of something they eat or breath
or  drink  is  a  part  of  your  everyday  existence.  If  you  live  in  such  a  place,  you  live
with worry and fear and maybe even a sense of guilt that by choosing to live there
you  are  exposing  your  family  to  something  that  could  make  them  sick  or  even  kill
them.

When  Congress  established  ATSDR  in  the  1980s,  we  hoped  that  it  would  be  like
the  cavalry  riding  over  the  horizon  to  come  and  tell  a  community  that  everything
was alright, or at least to let you know how bad the situation is. We expected them
to use the best science and develop ever more innovative ways to establish whether
some environmental problem was becoming a public health problem.

Unfortunately, ATSDR seems to be the gang that can’t shoot straight. They come
into  local  communities,  often  ignore  the  health  complaints  of  local  citizens,  seem  to
ignore  obvious  ways  to  determine  what  might  be  happening,  and  more  often  than
not go away saying there is nothing to worry about because they couldn’t find any-
thing.  As  witnesses  today  will  testify,  ATSDR  seems  to  resist  developing  new  sci-
entific methods for doing their work.

The  American  public  deserves  better  than  this  for  their  $74  million  a  year—that

is ATSDR’s budget—and I believe this agency can do better.

There are many, many dedicated public health professionals at ATSDR who would

love to call it as they see it.

There  is  ample  room  to  improve  the  Agency’s  scientific  methods,  and  to  be  more

creative in how they do science, so that the public is better served.

It is past time that we hold this agency to higher standards.

Panel I:

Chair MILLER. It is now my pleasure to introduce our first panel
of  witnesses.  Dr.  Salvador  Mier  is  the  former  Director  of  Preven-
tion  for  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  a  local  resident  of
Midlothian,  Texas.  Professor  Randall  Parrish  is  the  head  of  the
British  Geologic  Survey’s  Natural  Environmental  Research  Coun-
cil’s  Isotope  Geoscience  Laboratories  in  Nottingham,  England.  I
hope  he  doesn’t  repeat  all  that  at  every  cocktail  party.  He  partici-
pated  in  an  innovative  study  of  community  exposure  to  depleted
uranium  in  Colonie,  New  York.  Mr.  Jeffery  Camplin  is  the  Presi-
dent of Camplin Environmental Services Incorporated, a safety and
environmental  consulting  firm  in  Rosemont,  Illinois,  and  is  a  li-
censed  asbestos  consultant  for  the  Illinois  Dunesland  Preservation
Society. Dr. Ronald Hoffman is the Albert A. and Vera G. List Pro-
fessor  of  Medicine  at  the  Mount  Sinai  School  of  Medicine,  the  Di-
rector of Myeloproliferative Disorders——

Mr. BROUN. If you need some help with that, I will——
Chair  MILLER.  Perhaps  Dr.  Broun  could  introduce  Dr.  Hoffman.
I think it is easier now. Programs at the Tisch Cancer Institute at
Mount Sinai and formerly the President of the American Society of
Hematology.

It  is  the  practice  of  the  Subcommittee  to  take  testimony  under
oath. Do any of you have any objection to being sworn in? We also
provide  that  you  may  be  represented  by  counsel.  Are  any  of  you
represented  by  counsel  today?  We  ask  you  these  questions  to  put
you at ease.

If  you  would  now  all  rise  and  raise  your  right  hand.  Do  you
swear  to  tell  the  truth  and  nothing  but  the  truth?  Let  the  record
reflect that each of the witnesses responded in the affirmative. You
now  have  five  minutes  each  for  your  spoken  testimony.  Your  full
written  testimony  will  be  included  in  the  record  of  the  hearing.
When  you  complete  your  testimony,  we  will  begin  with  questions
and each Member will have five minutes to question the panel.

Mr. Mier, please begin.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  SALVADOR  MIER,  LOCAL  RESIDENT,
MIDLOTHIAN,  TEXAS;  FORMER  DIRECTOR  OF  PREVENTION,
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL
Mr.  MIER.  Thank  you,  Chair  Miller,  Dr.  Broun  and  other  Com-
mittee  Members.  Because  other  Midlothian  residents,  Midlothian,
Texas,  were  not  able  to  be  here  today  at  this  hearing,  they  asked
me to bring a short video that depicts some of the animal and dog
health  issues  that  we  have  had  concern  with,  and  I  would  like  to
request your permission, sir, to show that brief video.

Chair  MILLER.  Thank  you.  I  believe  that  we  have  talked  about
this at the staff level but the video is only a little more than three
minutes, three and one-half minutes.

Mr. MIER. Three minutes.
Chair  MILLER.  And  what  I  propose  is  to  allow  Mr.  Mier  to  show
the  video  and  have  that  not  counted  against  his  five  minutes  for
testimony. Without objection, Mr. Mier.

Mr.  MIER.  Our  community  is  on  a  treadmill  to  nowhere.  Our
human and animal health issues have been festering for years. Our
environmental  agency  declares  industrial  emissions  are  harmless
and  our  health  agency  uses  this  as  a  refuge  to  look  no  further.  In
my  40-year  public  health  career,  mostly  with  CDC,  I  never  experi-
enced  such  a  lack  of  will  to  determine  sources  of  illnesses.  There
was  never  a  quarrel  about  finding  a  cause  caused  by  a  bacteria  or
a  virus,  but  when  a  potential  source  is  involved  in  industry,  dy-
namics change drastically.

For  answers  I  look  toward  my  former  employer,  CDC.  Thus  we
petitioned ATSDR for a public health assessment in July 2005. But
instead  of  getting  the  trusted  health  information  promised  by
ATSDR  in  their  mission  statement,  we  ended  up  further  from  the
truth. ATSDR has demonstrated they are not committed to the re-
sponsibilities  inherent  in  their  mission  statement  or  they  are  not
willing  to  overcome  external  pressures  and  act  independently  to
abide by the commitments of this mission statement.

Midlothian,  Texas,  is  a  small  town  with  one  of  the  largest  steel
mills in the United States and the highest concentration of cement
manufacturing in the Nation with three plants, one of which is the
largest in the United States. These industries, in addition to tradi-
tional  fuel  and  other  refuse,  incinerate  whole  and  shredded  tires
and  hazardous  waste,  tons  of  hazardous  waste,  in  kilns  never  de-
signed  for  burning  hazardous  waste.  Daily,  tons  of  toxic  emissions
pour  out  of  10  cement  kilns  and  two  steel  industry  stacks.  Using
an  EPA  screening  model  in  2005,  Toxic  Release  Inventory,  USA
Today  in  collaboration  with  researchers  and  scientists  at  the  Uni-
versity  of  Massachusetts,  Johns  Hopkins  and  the  University  of
Maryland  ranked  all  schools  in  Midlothian  in  the  upper  third  per-
centile  of  the  Nation’s  most  toxic  schools.  Two  ranked  in  the  first
percentile  and  two  ranked  in  the  third.  After  hazardous  waste  be-
came a fuel source in Midlothian, physicians began seeing more pa-
tients  complaining  of  upper  respiratory  problems.  Ranchers  re-
ported  breeding  problems,  aborted  fetuses  and  deformed  offspring
in both horses and cattle. A statistically significant cluster of Down
Syndrome babies was identified in 1995. A study of respiratory ill-
nesses in Midlothian performed by the University of Texas surfaced
a 35 percent higher incidence of respiratory problems in Midlothian
as  compared  to  a  control  group.  A  study  in  2005  found  the  preva-
lence  of  overall  birth  defects  for  Midlothian  was  one  and  a  half
times  that  of  Texas,  and  the  prevalence  of  hypospadias  and
epispadias,  congenital  defects  in  which  the  urinary  outlet  opens
above or below the penis or on the perineum, was three and a half
times  that  of  the  State  of  Texas.  A  local  dog  breeder  experiences
in  her  animals  large  number  of  immune-deficiency  illnesses,  de-
formed  offspring,  litters  born  dead,  cancers  and  failure  to  thrive.
Questions  about  a  suspect  air  monitoring  system  were  dismissed.
What  about  all  of  the  empirical  evidence  that  was  surfacing?  No
answers came.

When ATSDR agreed to do the assessment, they said they would
ask the State health department to help. Once the state became in-
volved,  the  assessment  morphed  into  a  consultation  and  the  re-
sponsibility for making the decision was relegated to the state. The
same  individuals  who  had  for  years  declared  our  environment

33

posed no health problems were going to look at once more. Further-
more,  the  decision  was  to  be  based  on  State  monitoring  data,  the
same  questionable  data.  By  morphing  the  assessment  to  a  con-
sultation  and  using  the  same  data,  the  same  folks  could  pretend
not to see or totally ignore health problems and empirical evidence
by using the same familiar refuge. Air monitoring does not support
any  one  being  sick.  ATSDR  never  intended  to  be  an  active  partici-
pant  with  this  consultation.  We  were  never  going  to  get  off  that
treadmill, at least not with ATSDR’s help.

The consultation was finally released for public comment Decem-
ber  11,  2007.  Scientists  who  reviewed  it  made  the  following  com-
ments.  Dr.  Stewart  Batterman,  University  of  Michigan,  states,
‘‘The  health  consultation  is  biased.  It  contains  overarching  state-
ments that discount all indications that emissions from local indus-
try and environmental conditions might or do pose a health concern
in  our  community.  It  should  not  be  issued  by  ATSDR.’’  Dr.  Peter
deFur,  of  Virginia  Commonwealth  University,  states,  ‘‘ATSDR’s
classification  of  this  site  as  an  indeterminate  public  health  hazard
is  in  direct  contradiction  with  the  data  the  Agency  presents  in  the
report.  Throughout  the  document  ATSDR  attempts  to  marginalize
or  disregard  data  that  indicate  that  compounds  produce  human
health risk. ATSDR has more than enough data to classify the site
as  a  public  health  hazard.’’  Dr.  Neil  Carman,  a  scientist  who  for-
mally worked at the Texas State Environmental Agency, states, ‘‘It
fails  to  seriously  acknowledge  the  numerous  gaps  in  the  ambient
air monitoring in the Midlothian area.’’

We  naively  expected  an  objective  and  scientific  evaluation  that
would provide trusted health information. We were wrong. Instead,
ATSDR  abdicated  its  responsibilities  to  the  state  and  never  ques-
tioned  the  science  behind  the  collection  of  the  data  and  the  reli-
ability for making public health determinations. If ATSDR does not
have commitment or capacity to objectively temper and counter ex-
ternal  forces  that  dissuade  them  from  their  mission  to  serve  the
public  by  using  the  best  science  and  provided  trusted  health  infor-

sultation  business.  To  maintain  the  status  quo  will  only  continue
to risk the public health of many U.S. communities.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Mier follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SALVADOR MIER

We are on a treadmill to nowhere. Our community’s human and animal health
issues have been ‘‘festering’’ for a long time. Time and time again the Texas Depart-
ment  of  State  Health  Services  (TDSHS)  tell  citizens  of  Midlothian  the  Texas  Com-
mission  on  Environmental  Quality  (TCEQ)  affirms  toxic  emissions  from  industries
are  too  low  to  endanger  public  health—hence  there  is  no  point  in  looking  at  their
health issues. Pleas for help die at EPA, TDSHS and TCEQ doorsteps.

In  my  37-year  public  health  career—most  of  which  was  with  the  Centers  of  Dis-
ease  Control  (CDC)—I  never  experienced  such  a  reluctance  or  lack  of  will  to  deter-
mine sources of illnesses. There was never a quarrel about finding the source when
you were dealing with a bacteria or a virus. But when the potential source involves
an  industry,  dynamics  change  drastically.  This  is  why  I  decided  to  look  back  to-
wards  my  prior  employer  (CDC)  for  answers.  Thus,  we  turned  to  ATSDR,  the  pur-
ported ultimate environmental public health agency, for help.

Instead of getting help promised by ATSDR in their mission statement, we found

ourselves catapulted right back on to that treadmill and further from the truth.

ATSDR has demonstrated they either do not want the responsibilities inherent in
their  mission  statement  or  they  do  not  have  the  will  and  commitment  to  overcome

external  pressures  and  act  independently  to  abide  by  the  promises  of  this  mission
statement.

The Industries

Midlothian,  Texas,  has  the  largest  concentration  of  cement  manufacturing  in  the
United  States.  The  town  and  schools  are  nestled  amid  three  cement  manufactur-
ers—Dallas-based  TXI’s  Midlothian  cement  plant,  with  five  kilns,  boasts  to  be  the
biggest in the U.S.; Ash Grove of Kansas, with three older wet kilns and Swiss com-
pany  Holcim,  with  two  kilns,  are  nearby.  Limestone,  cement’s  main  component,  is
mined locally. Cement kiln dust is buried in local unlined quarries. These industries
incinerate,  among  traditional  fuels  and  other  refuse,  petroleum  coke,  whole  and
shredded  tires,  and  hazardous  waste—tons  of  hazardous  waste—in  kilns  never  de-
signed to burn hazardous waste.

Adjacent to TXI, Brazilian-owned Gerdau Ameristeel, one of the largest steel mills
in North America, melts trainloads of scrap metal and crushed cars into new struc-
tural steel.

Daily, tons of toxic emissions pour out of ten cement kilns and two steel industry

stacks.

In  late  1980  TXI  became  one  of  the  Nation’s  largest  hazardous-waste-combustion
facilities  accepting  commercial  hazardous  waste.  Cement  kilns  were  authorized  by
EPA in a 1996 MACT rule to operate under weaker, less protective MACT standards
for Hazardous Waste Combustors (HWC) compared to hazardous waste incinerators.

In a statement (attached) Dr. Neil Carman, Ph.D., comments:

‘‘Cement kilns burn up to 1,000 degrees hotter than incinerators and a concern
is they may burn too hot for metals causing higher mass emissions due to great-
er metal volatility at higher temperatures. . . . Exposure to toxic metals is con-
sistent with some health problems reported at Midlothian.’’

Contradictions in Data

In  a  report  ‘‘Midlothian  Industrial  Plant  Emission  Data,’’  Amanda  Caldwell  and
Susan  Waskey,  two  University  of  North  Texas  (UNT)  graduate  students  added  up
all  emission  reports  submitted  to  State  and  Federal  Government  by  the  three  ce-
ment  plants  and  adjacent  steel  mill  in  Midlothian.  They  spotlighted  differences  in
reported  volumes  of  air  pollution  when  industry  submits  emissions  reports  to  the
State versus the Federal Government. These students discovered:

‘‘A cursory examination of EPA air release data in Figure 56 (Total Air Releases
per Firm 1990–2006) and TCEQ air release data in Figure 60 (Total Hazardous
Air  Pollutants  per  Firm  1990–2006),  show  strikingly  different  results.  For  this
reporting  period,  the  EPA  data  shows  TXI  to  be  the  firm  with  the  largest
amount  of  toxic  chemicals  released  to  the  air  (5,287,384  lbs.),  while  the  state’s
data  show  Holcim  to  be  the  largest  emitter  of  hazardous  air  pollutants
(1,507,663 lbs).
According  to  the  plants’  TRI  [Toxic  Release  Inventory]  reports,  there  were  al-
most 48,000 pounds of lead air pollution released by all four facilities over the
entire  16  years,  versus  the  over  90,000  pounds  of  lead  the  same  plants  re-
ported  sending  up  their  stacks  to  the  TCEQ  and  its  predecessors  during  the
same period.
According  to  the  plant’s  TRI  reports,  there  were  approximately  5,000  pounds
of  Mercury  air  pollution  released  by  all  four  facilities  from  1990  to  2006
versus  the  approximately  10,000  pounds  of  Mercury  air  pollution  reported
to the state over the same time.’’

EPA  has  recently  acknowledged  total  mercury  emissions  from  cement  plants  in
the  U.S.  are  twice  as  high  as  reported  to  the  TRI.  Based  on  the  two  UNT  students
report,  TRI  emissions  appear  not  to  match  State  records.  Differences  like  these
should give rise to questions.

Midlothian Schools

Approximately 7,000 students attend nine schools situated in Midlothian.
USA Today in collaboration with the University of Massachusetts, the University
of  Maryland  and  Johns  Hopkins  University  employed  EPA  Model,  ‘‘Risk  Screening
Environmental  Indicators,’’  in  an  attempt  to  measure  the  extent  of  chemicals  chil-
dren  were  being  exposed  to  while  attending  school.  This  model  relied  on  EPA  TRI
data for calendar year 2005. In this analysis, all schools rated in Midlothian ranked
in  the  upper  third  percentile  of  the  Nation’s  most  toxic  schools.  Two  ranked  in  the
first percentile of the Nation’s most toxic schools, two ranked in the third percentile.

Their findings ‘‘Toxic Air and America’s Schools’’ were published in the USA Today
December 2008.

Risk Assessments

In  order  to  allay  community  anxiety  caused  by  the  burning  of  hazardous  waste,
in  November  1995,  the  TNRCC  (now  TCEQ)  prepared  the  Screening  Risk  Analysis
for the Texas Industries (TXI) Facility in Midlothian, Texas and the Critical Evalua-
tion  of  the  Potential  Impact  of  Emissions  From  Midlothian  Industries:  A  Summary
Report.

The American Lung Association contracted with Dr. Stuart Batterman, Ph.D., En-
vironmental  and  Industrial  Health,  University  of  Michigan,  to  do  an  evaluation  of
this risk analysis. In Dr. Batterman’s 70-page de novo analyses he warns:

‘‘. . . Based on risk assessment techniques, other environmental impact assess-
ment  methodologies,  and  an  assessment  of  existing  environmental  monitoring
data, we conclude that the environmental and health impacts have and are like-
ly  to  occur  in  the  Midlothian  area  from  industrial  activity,  including  the  com-
bustion  of  hazardous  waste  at  TXI.  That  TXI,  the  other  cement  kilns  and
steel  smelter  in  Midlothian  cause  impacts  is  inescapable.’’  [emphasis
mine]

Dr. Batterman further states:

‘‘. . . Some of the monitoring programs appear entirely reasonable. . .. Others,
however, are highly deficient with respect to study design, execution, data qual-
ity  and  data  analysis.  Overall,  the  monitoring  program  is  not  impressive  given
the  scale  of  industry  and  waste  combustion  in  Midlothian  and  the  degree  of
public concern.’’
‘‘. . . The serious deficiencies in the Screening Risk Analysis and Summary Re-
port  indicate  that  the  ability  of  the  TNRCC  to  conduct  an  objective  as-
sessment  is  compromised,  and  the  record  demonstrates  significant  concerns
regarding  the  effectiveness  of  the  TNRCC  in  regulating  the  combustion  of  haz-
ardous waste at TXI.’’

Illness Surfacing

• Ranchers  started  reporting  breeding  problems,  aborted  fetuses  and  deformed
• A  Statistically  Significant  cluster  of  Down  syndrome  babies  was  identified  in
• A  peer-reviewed  study  of  respiratory  illnesses  in  Midlothian,  conducted  by
University  of  Texas  Medical  Branch  and  authored  by  Dr.  Marvin  Legator  in
1996,  concluded  a  35  percent  higher  incidence  of  respiratory  problems  in
Midlothian than the control group.
• Based  on  a  study  completed  in  2005,  the  prevalence  of  overall  birth  defects
from  1999  through  2003  for  Midlothian  was  150  percent  that  of  Texas  and
the prevalence of hypospadias/epispadias (congenital defects in which the uri-
nary outlet opens above or below the penis or on the perineum) in Midlothian
was 350 percent that of the State.
• Since 1990 and continuing, Ms. Debra Markwardt, a local dog breeder experi-
ences large numbers of illness in her animals that are related to immune sys-
tem deficiency issues, aborted fetuses, failure to thrive, cancers and deformed
offspring.  Local  veterinarians  have  attributed  these  problems  to  environ-
mental factors. (See addendum for her statement.)
• In  1994  a  group  of  mothers  concerned  for  their  children  and  the  community
pleaded  with  EPA  that  EPA  at  least  do  an  animal  health  study.  Poorly
planned and based on a questionable methodology of execution, EPA initiated
an  animal  health  survey.  Ultimately,  the  survey  was  abandoned  and  no  con-
clusions  drawn.  The  study  did,  however,  identify  an  apparent  high  level  of
animal health problems in the study area in horses at one ranch. This ranch-
er had seven to ten horses in any given year and reported between 50–88 per-
cent  of  the  animals  had  reproductive  health  problems  during  the  survey  pe-
riod.  The  majority  of  these  horses  had  estrous/cyclic  problems.  One  mare  re-

peatedly had problems giving birth or keeping the foals after birth. This horse
died  shortly  before  the  survey  was  conducted  and  a  necropsy  was  performed.
An  inflamed  ovary  and  a  cyst  on  the  ovary  were  discovered.  There  was  also
chronic  enlargement  of  the  lymph  glands  in  the  head,  neck  and  under  the
throat. The mare exhibited a muscular line on the side of the abdomen indic-
ative  of  labored  breathing  problems.  (Note:  Problems  experienced  by  this
rancher  are  similar  to  problems  experienced  by  Ms.  Markwardt  and  other
livestock owners.)

ATSDR, TDSHS, TCEQ refuse to look at or even acknowledge the existence of any
empirical  evidence  for  fear  a  link  may  be  related  to  industrial  emissions  and  some
responsibility may ensue. They instead take refuge in theoretical mathematical com-
putations based on questionable air monitoring data.

Seeking Answers

For  years,  citizens  turned  to  TDSHS  for  help.  TCEQ  eagerly  and  staunchly  de-
clared emissions from industries were safe and TDSHS used this as a refuge to look
no further. No answers came.

Questions about a suspect air monitoring system and how air monitors not placed
in predominant wind patterns could produce valid readings went unanswered. What
about  all  the  empirical  evidence  that  was  surfacing?  No  answers  came.  Year after
year  this  cycle  kept  repeating.  The  search  for  a  scientifically  validated  re-
sponse could not get off the treadmill.

To  many  in  the  community,  TCEQ’s  methodology  for  collecting  air  monitoring
data  appeared  to  be  designed  to  avoid  major  emissions  and  to  create  an  illusion  of
ambient  air  purity.  Could  this  data’s  reliability  to  assess  community  impact  and
public health withstand the scrutiny of objective unbiased scientists? We thought we
would find that objectivity when we turned to ATSDR.

ATSDR Involvement

In July 2005, our petition went before an ATSDR panel. The panel deemed it met

the criteria for a public health assessment.

On August 10, 2005, we received a letter from ATSDR stating that ‘‘they’’ would
be  doing  a  Public  Health  Assessment  as  authorized  under  the  CERCLA.  ATSDR
indicated that they planned ‘‘to ask TDSHS for help’’ responding to our concerns.
This  was  disconcerting;  however,  ATSDR  was  a  federal  health-based  agency  with  a
mission  statement  that  promised  the  use  of  the  best  science  and  to  provide  trusted
health  information—and  they  would  be  in  control.  ‘‘So,  maybe,’’  we  thought,  ‘‘there
was hope.’’

Sadly, as the assessment started to slowly roll out, objectives began to morph into
paths that dodged addressing critical issues such as the need for a scientific assess-
ment of the monitoring data and an evaluation of the empirical evidence. Example:
1. Initially  ATSDR  promised  to  do  a  Public  Health  Assessment  ‘‘to  more  fully
characterize  the  emissions  from  multiple  large  industries  in  the  area  and
evaluate  potential  health  risks  resulting  from  individual  and  aggregate
chemical exposures.’’

2. Once  the  State  became  involved,  things  started  to  morph.  The  ‘‘Public
Health Assessment’’ changed  to  something  new.  On  Sept.  12,  2005,  we  re-
ceived  a  letter  from  ATSDR  stating  that  because  of  ‘‘*community  health
concerns’’  they  would  be  conducting  instead  a  health  consultation.  They
further  implied  that  a  health  consultation  would  allow  for  a  ‘‘timely  re-
sponse (early 2006).’’ In this letter ATSDR indicated that they were defer-
ring  the  decision  back  to  the  State.  ATSDR  would  review  and  certify  it.  In
addition (even though one major concern we expressed was the inad-
equacy  of  the  State  monitoring  data  for  evaluating  public  health
issues)  they  stated  they  would  rely  on  State  monitoring  data  to  make  con-
clusions. It was at this point I realized we were catapulted right back
on to that treadmill going nowhere.
(*Note:  I  am  still  puzzled  about  what  ATSDR  meant  by  ‘‘community  health
concerns.’’  The  community  was  concerned  that  no  one  was  looking  at  their
health  issues  and  asking  the  question,  ‘‘Could  something  by  awry  with  the
monitoring  data  in  which  TDSHS  and  TCEQ  take  refuge  to  declare  there
were no public health issues?’’ Obviously the community’s ‘‘health concerns’’
and ATSDR’s health concern did not run a parallel path.)
An  assessment  requires  a  closer  examination  of  community  health  issues
and  may  even  entail  some  epidemiological  activities;  whereas,  theoretically

37

a consultation is done when time is of essence and a rapid decision is nec-
essary.  The  value  of  a  consultation  from  ATSDR’s/TDSHS’  perspective
would  be  that  if  air-monitoring  data  did  not  support  any  adverse  health  ef-
fects,  the  job  ends  there.  All  empirical  evidence  and  epidemiological
data  can  then  be  ignored.  All  other  red  flags  indicating  health  problems
such  as  high  birth  defects,  immune  system  deficiencies,  animal  issues,
UTMB  Study  on  Upper  Respiratory  illness,  etc.,  can  be  dismissed  as  irrele-
vant.  Since  ATSDR/TDSHS  were  going  to  accept  monitoring  data  at  face
value  and  if  this  monitoring  data  is  purported  to  reflect  the  cleanest  air  in
Texas, the simplicity of the conclusions was promising.

3. To further simplify the task, the scope of the consultation narrows to looking

at air data only.

4. Toxins  in  the  air  can  be  tricky—entering  a  body  in  more  ways  than  one.  So
to avoid any possible complications, the scope must now be further narrowed
to the ‘‘inhalation’’ pathway only.

Empirical  evidence  and  epidemiological  data  has  been  deemed  non-rel-
evant  for  this  consultation.  It  has  been  treated  like  an  untouchable  pariah.  To
include  it  would  mean  someone  would  have  to  address  whether  something  is  awry.
This is a challenge that apparently ATSDR nor the State want to face.

I  finally  realized  that  regardless  of  what  arguments  are  made  or  regardless  of
what empirical evidence is presented, the bottom line on this public health consulta-
tion was determined before it even began. The entire process would just be a matter
of making documentation support the bottom line.

We needed input from objective unbiased reputable scientists. Shortly  be-
fore the consultation was due to be released, I reached out begging for help. Six sci-
entists responded and offered their time and skills to critique the draft consultation
report.

A draft decision with an ‘‘Indeterminate Public Health Hazard’’ was finally posted

for comments on December 11, 2007.

What the Scientists Said

The scientists who reviewed the draft were all highly critical of the product.
Dr. Stuart Batterman, Ph.D., Professor  of  Environmental  Health  in  the  School
of  Public  Health  and  Professor  of  Civil  and  Environmental  Engineering  at  the  Col-
lege  of  Engineering,  both  at  the  University  of  Michigan,  comments:  ‘‘. . .  This
Health Consultation has so many omissions, inconsistencies, and inadequate, flawed,
or  misleading  analyses  and  language  that  my  best  suggestion,  given  in  advance  of
my comments, is that it should not be issued by ATSDR. . . . The Health Consulta-
tion  is  biased.  It  contains  overarching  statements  that  discount  all  indications  that
emissions  from  local  industry  and  environmental  conditions  might  or  do  pose  a
health  concern  in  the  community.  The  Health  Consultation  should  be  objective  yet
maintain  the  health-protective  stance  which  is  appropriate  for  health-based  agencies
like  ATSDR.  . . .  The  Health  Consultation  relies  exclusively  on  air  quality  moni-
toring  results  measured  at  four  monitors.  It  does  not  discuss,  in  any  coherent  way,
the adequacy of the spatial and temporal coverage of this network. This includes, for
example, the ability to identify hotspots, the appropriateness of the network, the ade-
quacy  of  the  monitored  parameters,  the  quality  of  the  data,  and  the  need  for  addi-
tional  monitoring  sites.  . . .  There  is  little  mention  of  meteorology.  The  area  shows
very  persistent  and  directional  winds,  which  means  that  monitors  that  are  not  di-
rectly downwind are likely to not show impacts from local sources. The Health Con-
sultation should include appropriate wind roses and other analyses that indicate the
likely  impact  areas  vis-a´-vis  monitoring  sites.  . . .  In  its  present  form,  however,  I
find  so  many  biases  and  deficiencies  that  I  do  not  believe  that  the  Health  Consulta-
tion achieves its aims and, as stated above, I would urge that ATSDR reconsider its
issuance.

I do hope that ATSDR sponsorship and oversight provides a means to correct these

problems . . ..’’

Dr.  Peter  L.  deFur,  Ph.D.,  and  Kyle  Newman,  Environmental  Stewardship
Concepts,  comment:  ‘‘. . .  ATSDR’s  classification  of  this  site  as  an  ‘‘Indeterminate
Public  Health  Hazard’’  is  in  direct  contradiction  with  the  data  the  Agency  presents
in  the  report.  Throughout  the  document,  ATSDR  attempts  to  marginalize  or  dis-
regard data that indicate that compounds produce human health risks. ATSDR has
more  than  enough  data  to  classify  the  site  as  a  ‘‘Public  Health  Hazard.  . . .  The
problems with this assessment are numerous, and the most serious problem with the
interpretation  is  that  ATSDR  discounts  their  own  metrics  of  health  effects,  ignoring
the data that exceed health levels.

For a number of chemicals, the air concentrations are in excess of the health levels,
but  ATSDR  dismisses  the  excess  toxic  chemicals  as  not  a  problem  because  the  num-
ber  or  people  harmed  is  small,  despite  the  fact  that  the  risks  exceed  the  levels  used
to protect people from environmental threats (i.e., one in a million) . . .’’

Dr.  Neil  Carman,  Ph.D.,  Program  Director,  Lone  Star  Chapter  of  Sierra  Club
and  former  employee  of  the  Texas  State  environmental  agency,  comments:  ‘‘I  find
the report highly inadequate for a variety of reasons [listed in full in comments] and
fails  to  seriously  acknowledge  the  numerous  gaps  in  the  ambient  air  monitoring  in
the Midlothian area. . . . A basic concern here is that asthma, allergies, immune sys-
tem  deficiencies,  and  other  health  problems  in  adults  and  children  are  not  being
evaluated  and  yet  these  kinds  of  adverse  health  effects  are  being  reported  by
Midlothian residents . . .’’

Dr. Dennis Cesarotti, Ph.D., Northern Illinois University, comments: ‘‘It appears
that the DSHS (State Public Health) set out to prove that there were no health issues
in Midlothian, Texas.’’

Dr.  Al  Armendariz,  Ph.D.,  Environmental  Engineer,  Southern  Methodist  Uni-
versity  comments:  ‘‘The  report  lacks  an  analysis  of  the  impact  of  dioxin  and  furan
emissions  from  local  industry  to  the  public  health  of  the  community  . . .  however,
dioxin  and  furan  emissions  are  an  extremely  significant  component  of  the  emissions
from  the  local  industry.  . . .  a  significant  fraction  of  the  mercury  emitted  by  the  in-
dustrial sources in the area is likely to be emitted in gaseous form, given the volatile
nature of mercury, and the temperatures of the stack gases. The gaseous mercury will
not be collected in the particulate filters, leading to further underestimates of the true
atmospheric  concentrations  of  mercury.  In  addition,  the  gaseous  mercury  will  not  be
detected by the techniques used to identify the VOC compounds.’’

Debra  L.  Morris,  Ph.D.,  Adjunct  Assistant  Professor  in  the  Department  of  Pre-
ventive Medicine and Community at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Gal-
veston, comments: ‘‘A symptom survey of residents in the geographical area that this
document covers has been conducted and published (Legator et al., 1998). The results
of this study showed that residents in this area had more respiratory symptoms than
individuals  in  a  control  region.  However,  I  am  unaware  that  any  attempt  has  been
made  to  follow  up  on  the  results  of  the  study  using  methodology  that  directly  ad-
dresses and measures the health concerns of the community. Because the individuals
in  this  area  are  exposed  to  a  combination  of  chemicals,  studies  of  health  effects  in
this population would be much more revealing than an approach that makes mathe-
matical  approximations  of  the  health  risks  based  on  measurements  of  individual
chemicals.’’ [Dr. Morris was a participant in this study.]

TCEQ Response

The  Texas  environmental  agency  (TCEQ)  was  highly  critical  of  the  ‘‘Indetermi-

nate’’ finding. In comments to EPA, posted on their website TCEQ complains:

‘‘POTENTIAL  IMPACT  ON  TCEQ:  The  Indeterminate  Public  Health  Hazard
finding regarding air toxics in Midlothian may lead citizens and elected officials
to  believe  the  air  quality  is  causing  health  impacts  when  air  toxics  monitoring
in  the  Midlothian  area  not  only  indicates  acceptable  air  quality  but  also  better
air  quality  than  most  monitored  areas  of  the  country.  This  concern  could  lead
to pressure on TCEQ to shift resources from areas of concern in order to expend
more resources in the Midlothian area.’’

As of this date (March 12, 2009), the public health consultation has not been final-

ized.

Due to this Administration’s proposed strategy to rebuild the Nation’s in-
frastructure,  the  steel  and  cement  industries  are  in  a  position  to  boom.  In
the  last  year,  however,  all  local  industries  in  Midlothian  have  severely  cut  back  on
production  of  concrete  and  steel.  As  of  October  2008,  TXI  has  temporarily,  idled  its
four older wet kilns and has temporarily suspended burning hazardous waste. What
is  coming  out  of  the  industries  now  does  not  represent  what  the  community  has
been  exposed  to  or  what  they  will  be  exposed  to  once  production  accelerates  and
once burning of hazardous waste resumes. If you want a less than adequate pic-
ture  of  emissions  to  which  the  public  has  been  exposed  and  to  which  they
will be exposed—now is the time to monitor.

In  an  effort  to  get  the  ‘‘Indeterminate  Public  Health  Hazard’’  lifted,  TCEQ  em-
barked on a $349,000 project purportedly to ‘‘answer some of the community’s ques-
tions’’  and  determine  the  percent  of  chromium-6  in  the  identified  chromium  emis-
sions (a major unknown factor that lead to the indeterminate finding).

The  first  of  four  five-day  monitoring  periods  scheduled  over  a  year  took  place  in
December  2008—right  after  TXI  temporarily  idled  its  four  older  wet  kilns
and  temporarily  suspended  incineration  of  hazardous  waste.  ‘‘TXI’s  status

might affect the chromium’s numbers depending on whether the older kilns are oper-
ating  during  any  testing,’’  TCEQ  officials  conceded  to  a  reporter  from  the  Dallas
Morning News.

Any monitoring during the time hazardous waste is not being incinerated
would skew more than just the chromium numbers. It would also not capture
emissions  with  the  highest  levels  of  concern—those  resulting  from  the  incineration
of hazardous waste. What information will this data provide? Perhaps it will provide
a baseline for comparison when hazardous waste incineration is revived.

The fact that this data will not be representative of actual emissions to which the
public  was  exposed,  or  will  be  exposed,  appears  not  to  be  a  material  consideration
in  the  scheduling  of  air  monitoring.  How  ATSDR/TDSHS  plan  to  retrofit  this
data  into  the  conclusions  of  the  public  health  consultation  remains  ques-
tionable.

When  ATSDR  was  questioned  about  the  reliability  of  any  data  collected  during
the  idling  of  these  kilns,  during  decline  in  production,  and  during  the  temporary
suspension  of  hazardous  waste  incineration,  the  response  was,  ‘‘We  have  no  control
over  changes  in  plant  operations  due  to  economic  conditions.  Couple  this  with  the
fact  that  State  agencies  often  have  a  limited  window  within  which  funds  made
available for a project must be spent.’’ Spending funds seemed more important
than the quality of the data and evaluating public health impact to real ex-
posures. What appears to be important is that the money be spent now.

ATSDR  critically  missed  the  boat  at  step  one.  They  failed  to  validate  the  science
behind the methodology used to determine the placement of the air monitors. If they
could not validate the data at the initial step, of what value are any ensuing conclu-
sions? The deficiencies in this consultation indicate ATSDR’s ability to con-
duct an objective assessment is compromised.

We  never  asked  anyone  to  find  a  problem  if  one  did  not  exist.  We  just  wanted
an  unbiased  objective  assessment.  We  expected  an  assessment  incorporating  the
most recent science, logic, common sense and objectivity. We did not get this.

Instead of exercising due diligence by becoming an active participant in the eval-
uation,  ATSDR  relegated  their  responsibility  without  question  back  to  the  State.
The  assessment  of  Midlothian’s  public  health  ended  up  back  in  the  hands  of  the
same decision-makers who over the years staunchly and flagrantly turned a deaf ear
and  blind  eye  to  the  empirical  evidence  handed  them.  Science  was  not  going  to
be factored in.

It  appears  ATSDR  divorced  themselves  from  their  mission  statement.  There  was
no value added to ATSDR’s involvement. ATSDR’s involvement only served to keep
the public at bay for another four years. It was a costly waste of taxpayers’ money.
This involvement only elongated a process to nowhere and gave credence to impedi-
ments in the system that block science and truth.

If ATSDR does not have the commitment or capacity to objectively temper and
counter  external  forces  that  dissuade  them  from  their  mission  to  serve  the  public
by  using  the  best  science  and  providing  trusted  health  information—then  ATSDR
needs to get out of the Public Health Assessment and Consultation business. Main-
taining  the  status  quo  will  only  continue  risking  the  public  health  of  many  U.S.
communities.

U.S. communities desperately need an external environmental public health enti-
ty  able  to  carry  out  the  mission  assigned  to  ATSDR.  Perhaps  contracting  with  a
University  or  a  School  of  Public  Health  would  be  a  better  alternative.  We  need  an
entity that is proactive and not just merely an acquiescing observer.

STATEMENT OF DEBRA MARKWARDT

MIDLOTHIAN, TEXAS
AREA DOG BREEDER

I am Debra Markwardt, a professional dog breeder since 1982. When I moved my
home  and  business  to  Midlothian  in  1988  my  animals  were  all  thriving.  Over  the
years  my  animals  started  manifesting  health  issues.  They  did  not  seem  to  thrive
as  well.  Entire  litters  were  dying.  (Last  year  I  lost  75  percent  of  my  litters.)  Pups
were being born with strange birth defects that I had not previously seen in my ani-
mals. Birth defects such as large domed heads, external intestines, extra or missing
limbs,  blindness,  missing  testicles,  distorted  genitalia,  no  visible  signs  of  urinary
outlet, etc., became common.

Hair  analysis  for  me  and  for  some  of  my  animals  was  done.  Varying  degrees  of
heavy  metals  have  been  identified  in  all  of  these  tests.  Every  one  of  these  tests  re-
flected  extremely  high  levels  of  aluminum.  High  aluminum  in  their  systems  causes
extreme  mineral  imbalances  depleting  their  body  of  essential  nutrients.  Aluminum,
lead,  and  mercury  go  to  the  brain  and  nervous  system,  thereby  poisoning  every
organ of the body. As the immune systems deteriorate diseases manifest.

My animals also started manifesting severe problems with their coats. They were
becoming  emaciated  and  failing  to  thrive.  Problems  were  more  evident  in  the  very
young and in the older animals. Pups were born with heavy metals in their system
and weaker immune systems. If a pup survived past six to eight months it survived
relatively  well.  My  vet  explained  that  some  pups  had  stronger  immune  systems
than  others.  If  their  survival  passed  that  critical  period,  it  was  an  indicator  of  a
stronger  immune  system.  I  have  lost  about  75  young  adult  dogs  since  I  moved  to
Midlothian.

Ranchers in the community were having similar problems with their livestock. Ef-
forts to get these issues addressed died at the doorsteps of EPA, Texas Department
of  State  Health  Services  (TDSHS),  and  the  Texas  Commission  on  Environmental
Quality  (TCEQ).  TCEQ  said  our  environment  in  no  way  posed  a  problem  and  this
was the reason TDSHS could comfortably walk away.

When  ATSDR  became  involved  we  had  hopes  that  we  finally  had  an  agency  that

would look at our problems and give us a scientific answer.

Midlothian  is  experiencing  birth  defects  in  their  children  at  a  rate  150  percent
that of the state. They are experiencing hypospadia/epispadias at a rate 350 percent
that  of  the  state.  I  believe  birth  defects  in  my  animals  parallel  birth  defects  seen
in  children  born  in  Midlothian.  I  also  felt  that  immune  system  deficiencies  docu-
mented in my dogs parallel problems people in the community were alleging.

I  cannot  understand  why  ATSDR  and  TDSHS  do  not  believe  what  is  happening
to my animals is relevant to the assessment of this community’s public health. What
is happening to my animals could be happening to the people of Midlothian. I keep
getting  a  brush-off  from  ATSDR  with  comments  like  ‘‘. . .  veterinary  and  animal
issues  are  outside  of  our  mandated  domain’’  and  ‘‘. . .  studies  involving  animals,
even  as  sentinels  for  human  health  issues,  are  not  activities  engaged  in  or  funded
by  our  agency’’  and  ultimately  ‘‘. . .  ATSDR  and  the  Texas  Department  of  State
Health  Services  do  not  have  the  expertise  to  conduct  the  appropriate  animal  stud-
ies.’’

I  was  not  asking  them  to  do  an  animal  study.  I  offered  my  data  for  use  in  the
ATSDR  public  health  consultation  as  possible  sentinels  to  what  could  and  may  be
happening  to  the  community.  ATSDR  firmly  stated  that  there  would  be  no  associa-
tion  of  these  animals  with  the  public  health  consultation  they  were  doing  for
Midlothian.  There  are  children  who  are  waiting  to  be  born.  These  animals  could
be a key to their future. Who will help these children?

Below, are examples of what I have been experiencing—different birth defects, re-
sults  of  immune  system  deficiencies,  and  examples  of  how  animals  with  weakened
immune  system  respond  when  raised  away  or  removed  from  Midlothian.  I  too  am
experiencing health problems. On the last page is a statement from my doctor.

Re: Comments on 2007 Public Health Consultation for Midlothian, Texas

Dear Texas Department of State Health Services Consultation staff:

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00102 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

I  am  writing  to  share  serious  concerns  over  the  gaps  and  inadequacies  presented
in the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDHS) and the Agency for Toxic
Substances  and  Disease  Registry  (ATSDR)  report  titled  ‘‘Health  Consultation—
Midlothian  Area  Air  Quality  Part  1:  Volatile  Organic  Compounds  &  Metals.’’  I  find
the report highly inadequate for a variety of reasons and fails to seriously acknowl-
edge the numerous gaps in the ambient air monitoring in the Midlothian area.

Background Levels: Waste Incineration Conducted at Kaufman, TX

‘‘We  obtained  background  levels  for  many  of  the  contaminants  from  TCEQ
monitoring results for the town of Kaufman, TX, a town of similar
population size, no large industry, and which is only rarely down-
wind from Midlothian.’’

At  least  one  serious  concern  about  using  Kaufman,  TX  is  the  fact  that  relatively
large-scale  waste  incineration  has  been  conducted  for  many  years  in  this  commu-
nity.  Incinerators  operated  in  Kaufman  include  municipal  waste  combustion  facili-
ties  or  medical  waste  incineration  or  both,  which  emit  many  of  the  same  products
of  incomplete  combustion  (PICs)  as  do  cement  kiln  hazardous  waste  incinerators
such as Dioxins, Dibenzofurans, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, Polycyclic Aromatic Hy-
drocarbons and Metals. I recommend that you consult with TCEQ about how many
waste  incineration  facilities  were  operated  or  are  still  operating  in  Kaufman,  TX.
However,  I  have  no  details  or  information  about  the  siting  of  the  TCEQ’s  Kauf-
man  monitor  relative  to  the  waste  incineration  facilities  and  whether  the  monitor
was downwind or upwind of the incineration facilities. But the fact that large-scale
waste incinerators may have been operating in Kaufman over many years indicates
that  the  use  of  Kaufman,  TX  is  inappropriate  for  any  comparisons  to  Midlothian,
TX.

PART I
Sampling every six days for VOCs & metals. May 1981–March 2005.
1.  Sampling  site  selection  for  TCEO  ambient  air  monitoring  raises  many  issues.  A
number  of  the  Midlothian  and  Ellis  County  TCEQ  sampling  sites  are  not  selected
for  suitable  sampling  suits  as  to  be  downwind  of  the  Midlothian  industrial  plant
emissions  plumes  and  will  not  provide  valid  downwind  ambient  air  concentrations
to  measure  emissions  from  the  industrial  plants.  How  many  Midlothian  and  Ellis
County  TCEQ  sampling  sites  are  actually  in  the  general  downwind  area  of  the
plants and how far in feet are these?
2. Sampling frequency raises another set of ambient air monitoring issues. Sampling
on  a  once  in  six  day  sample  duty  cycle  only  looks  at  most  at  16.7  percent  of  the
days for air pollution and excludes for analysis 83.3 percent of the time period every
year.
3.  Sampling—protocol  of  flow  rate  and  analytical  limitations  also  present  a  number
of additional ambient air monitoring issues that need to be addressed. Many air con-
taminants  are  excluded  from  laboratory  analysis  and  many  are  not  detected  due  to
minimum  detection  limits  set  above  threshold  where  many  toxic  air  contaminants
may be present such as dioxins, dibenzofurans, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, and others.
A.1.  While  it  is  true  that  ‘‘all  the  chemicals  being  released  from  cement
kilns  and  steel  mills  have  not  been  fully  identified,’’  this  health  consulta-
tion  has  evaluated  237  individual  contaminants  including  119  VOCs  and
108 metals and other inorganic substances.

Another  concern  surrounds  the  question  of  whether  the  TDSHS  scientists  have
any  prior  experience  in  performing  an  evaluation  of  a  commercial  or  private  haz-
ardous  waste  combustion  facility  in  Texas  before  this  current  Midlothian  effort.
Since  this  is  not  a  responsibility  typically  involving  the  TDSHS  scientists,  the  con-
sultation  may  be  partly  compromised  by  the  inability  to  comprehend  the  complex
emissions hazards associated with such hazardous waste storage, treatment and dis-
posal  facilities  as  exist  at  Midlothian.  For  example,  downwind  air  monitoring  sites
may be too far away from the hazardous waste facilities to be able to detect ground
level fugitive hazardous waste emissions leaks from the transfer, storage and piping
system  at  such  a  facility.  However,  having  myself  visited  Midlothian  many  times
and  having  been  downwind  of  the  hazardous  waste  facilities,  I  definitely  noticed
during  each  visit  that  there  were  in  my  opinion  distinct  fugitive  gaseous  emissions
from these operations that produced instant severe headaches. While I cannot state

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

96

for  certain  if  such  fugitive  gaseous  emissions  were  associated  with  the  hazardous
waste  operations,  I  did  not  notice  similar  fugitive  gaseous  emissions  from  the  two
non-hazardous  waste  cement  kilns  at  Midlothian.  As  a  result,  I  maintain  that  the
fugitive  gaseous  emissions  from  the  hazardous  waste  cement  kiln  were  associated
with its hazardous waste operations.

Hazardous waste chemistry is highly complex and may become more complex dur-
ing  and  immediately  after  the  incineration  process.  Hazardous  waste  consists  of
toxic  soup  mixtures  of  innumerable  organic  and  inorganic  chemicals,  elemental
chemicals,  metals,  acids,  bases,  salts,  waste  water  and  other  wastes  from  complex
industrial manufacturing processes.

Hazardous  waste  incineration  has  the  potential  to  take  the  thousands  of  organic
and  inorganic  chemicals  and  chemically  transform  them  into  thousands  and  thou-
sands of incompletely burned compounds.

The  consultation  did  not  include  consideration  of  the  need  to  sample  the  air,
water  and  food  chains  for  known  species  of  the  following  twenty  groups  of  halo-
genated organic chemicals that are toxicologically known to cause adverse biological
effects through the Ah-r-mediated mechanism of action:

Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins
Polychlorinated dibenzo-furans
Polychlorinated biphenyls
Polychlorinated naphthalenes
Polychlorinated diphenyltoluenes
Polychlorinated diphenyl ethers
Polychlorinated anisoles
Polychlorinated xanthenes
Polychlorinated xanthones
Polychlorinated anthracenes
Polychlorinated fluorenes
Polychlorinated dihydroanthracenes
Polychlorinated diphenylmethanes
Polychlorinated phenylxylylethanes
Polychlorinated dibenzothiophenes
Polychlorinated quarterphenyls
Polychlorinated quarterphenyl ethers
Polychlorinated biphenylenes
Polybrommated diphenyl ethers
Polychlorinated azoanthracenes

Cite:  Table  4—Compounds  that  May,  Based  on  Experimental  Evidence  or  Struc-
ture,  Be  Expected  to  Have  the  Potential  to  Cause  Adverse  Effects  through  the  Ah-
r-mediated  mechanism  of  action,  p.  266  in  Chapter  9,  ‘‘Dioxins,  Dibenzofurans,
PCBs  and  Colonial,  Fish-Eating  Water  Birds’’  by  John  P.  Giesy,  James  P.  Ludwig,
and  Donald  E.  Tillin,  published  in  Dioxins  and  Health  edited  by  Arnold  Schecter,
Plenum Press, New York, 1994.

There  may  be  other  possible  organics  including  polybrominated  aromatic  com-
pounds,  polychlorinated-brominated  aromatic  compounds,  polyfluorinated  aromatic
compounds,  polychlorinated-fluorinated  aromatic  compounds,  and  other  polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (all lumped together as ‘‘dioxins’’ here).

The  large-scale  hazardous  waste  incineration  activities  conducted  at  Midlothian
for  approximately  twenty  years  create  unique  circumstances  for  producing  the  air
emissions of a large number of exceptionally toxic substances since there is no such
thing  as  100  percent  combustion  efficiency  and  total  organic  chemical  destruction
in  any  incineration  devices  let  alone  cement  kilns.  A  basic  concern  is  that  the  con-
sultation  has  seriously  underestimated  and  downplayed  the  dangers  of  large  scale
incineration of hazardous waste for a local community. The large scale incineration
of  hazardous  waste  has  an  expected  potential  to  create  thousands  of  unusual  by-
products of incomplete combustion (some of these organic compounds are created by
partial  thermal  decomposition  of  the  waste  mixtures  and  other  compounds  are  cre-
ated  by  rapid  ‘‘de  novo  synthesis’’  in  the  cooling  stack  gas  phase)  with  many  occur-
ring  at  levels  below  the  frequently  used  one  part  per  billion  detectability  limit  in
organic  analytical  equipment.  But  most  of  these  unusual  byproducts  of  incomplete
combustion are not measured or identified due to their difficult chemical character-
istics, which need highly specialized analysis at extremely low concentrations below
most  VOC  analyzers.  Of  course,  dioxin  and  dibenzofuran  analytical  equipment  go
well  below  the  1.0  ppb  level  down  in  the  low  parts  per  trillion  levels  and  parts  per
quadrillion  range.  It’s  not  feasible  to  conclude  if  the  119  VOCs  reviewed  represent
50  percent  of  the  total  VOC  species  emitted  or  25  percent  or  10  percent  or  less.
Without a more comprehensive VOC analysis of the total low part per trillion range

VOC  species,  highly  toxic  organics  like  the  dioxins  are  being  ignored  completely  in
the consultation.

Some of these VOCs will be bound to the particulate matter emitted and this rep-
resents  another  fraction  of  the  total  VOCs  in  the  ambient  air.  But  VOC  sampling
that  collects  only  gaseous  phase  organics  and  not  the  particle  phase  organics  will
miss a fraction of the VOC compounds in the air.

Reviewers need to ask: What is the range of possible types of VOCs produced from
large-scale  hazardous  waste  incineration?  What  is  the  range  of  the  possible  con-
centrations  of  the  VOCs  produced  from  large-scale  hazardous  waste  incineration?
Are  these  VOCs  being  detected?  Yes,  some  VOC  byproducts  are  being  detected  as
indicated by 119 VOCs, but the concern is that many VOCs (several thousand more
VOCs)  are  not  being  detected  due  to  the  high  detectability  limits  in  the  analytical
equipment such as 1.0 ppb and the potential for similar VOC species to overlap.

The  same  applies  to  inorganic  compounds  and  metals,  and  in  many  monitoring

sites, inorganic compounds and metals were not even collected.

The  TCEQ  has  no  laboratory  facilities  specifically  established  for  conducting
dioxin  and  dibenzofuran  analyses,  and  due  to  the  costs  of  such  analyses,  it’s  typi-
cally not required by the TCEQ on most environmental samples due to the expense
of such laboratory analysis.

The  EPA  has  recognized  along  with  the  organic  chemistry  science  that  any  form
of chlorine (organic and inorganic) in combination with carbon in a combustion proc-
ess  will  produce  the  expected  dioxins  and  dibenzofurans  by  rapid  ‘‘de  novo  syn-
thesis.’’ The large-scale hazardous wastes burned at Midlothian have routinely con-
tained numerous organic chlorinated residues and inorganic chemicals which would
be expected to produce certain stack concentrations of dioxins and dibenzofurans by
rapid  ‘‘de  novo  synthesis.’’  Some  dioxins  and  dibenzofurans  may  also  be  present
among the chlorinated hydrocarbons and inorganic chlorine compounds in the large-
scale hazardous wastes burned and could be emitted as undestroyed chemicals.
A.2.  It  is  also  true  that  ‘‘All  the  chemicals  currently  being  incinerated  and
released have not been tested for carcinogenicity and endocrine disrupting
potential.’’  However,  based  on  historical  reviews  of  cancer  incidence  and/
or  mortality  rates  in  Midlothian  and  Ellis  County,  no  individual  or  aggre-
gate cancer rates were significantly elevated with respect to the rest of the
state.

Several problems exist with the Texas Cancer Registry databases and the conclu-
sion of ‘‘no individual or aggregate cancer rates were significantly elevated
with respect to the rest of the state’’ seems premature and an unscientific state-
ments. The Cancer Registry is significantly flawed itself in its omissions and track-
ing system. Many people do not show up in this database.

The  EPA’s  recent  Endocrine  Screening,  Testing  Advisory  Committee  (EDSTAC)
only  recommended  testing  of  potential  endocrine  disrupting  chemicals  for  inter-
ference  in  three  human  hormonal  pathways  of  estrogen,  thyroid  and  androgen.  All
other hormones were excluded by endocrine testing and screening.
A.4., C.3., & D.3. The community was concerned about the health effects of
dioxins,  metals,  and  mixtures  of  compounds.  Air  data  for  dioxins  are  not
routinely  collected  in  Texas;  therefore  it  was  not  possible  to  evaluate  the
potential adverse health effects associated with these compounds. We eval-
uated  available  VOCs  and  metals  air  contaminant  data  with  respect  to  its
potential  for  causing  adverse  health  effects  in  humans  due  to  acute,  inter-
mediate,  and/or  chronic  exposures.  Only  manganese  exceeded  its  health
based  screening  value  for  chronic  inhalation  exposures.  However,  based
upon a review of the toxicological data, we would not expect to see adverse
health  effects  due  to  either  long-term  or  short-term  exposure  to  man-
ganese.  Mixtures  of  compounds  also  were  evaluated  in  this  consultation.
Long-term  aggregate  exposures  to  air  contaminants  in  Midlothian  are  not
expected to result in adverse non-cancer or cancer health effects.

I  find  the  conclusion  on  the  VOC’s  seriously  flawed  and  unsound  since  too  many
organic  chemicals  are  not  even  monitored  for  in  Midlothian.  I  don’t  think  that
TDSHS has any idea or even an intelligent guess as to how many organic chemicals
were not being detected due to their presence below the detectability analytical lim-
its  of  the  lab  equipment  or  were  not  being  analyzed  for  at  all  such  as  all  of  the
dioxin-related compounds. See more comments under A–1.

This  conclusion  is  not  scientific  and  is  based  on  extremely  limited  data  that  can-
not  logically  support  or  confirm  such  a  broad  sweeping  conclusion:  ‘‘Mixtures  of
compounds  also  were  evaluated  in  this  consultation.  Long-term  aggregate
exposures  to  air  contaminants  in  Midlothian  are  not  expected  to  result  in

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

98

adverse non-cancer or cancer health effects.’’ One reason is that not all of the
mixtures  can  possibly  be  determined  without  a  great  deal  more  ambient  air  moni-
toring  and  far  more  sophisticated  laboratory  analyses  looking  at  many  more  prod-
ucts of incomplete combustion including levels in the parts per trillion where many
toxic dioxin-related compounds occur or even lower levels.
A.5.,  A.7.,  &  C.1.  In  this  health  consultation,  DSHS  has  analyzed  each  and
every individual air sampling result collected from all TCEQ sampling loca-
tions  in  the  Midlothian  area  and  has  not  relied  on  any  TCEQ-summarized
data. Also, DSHS has not relied on any of the TCEQ’s effects screening lev-
els (ESLs) for determining potential health risks associated with exposures
to airborne contaminants in Midlothian.

Significant  limitations  exist  with  the  sampling  and  analysis  program  in

Midlothian.
A.6.  &  D.4.  The  community  was  concerned  that  the  potential  for  adverse
health  effects  may  be  underestimated  due  to  averaging  of  contaminant
data over time. The initial screening of the air data involved comparing the
maximum  concentration  for  each  contaminant  to  its  most  conservative
health-based  screening  value.  Contaminants  whose  maximum  concentra-
tions  exceeded  the  most  conservative  health-based  screening  value  were
evaluated  for  acute,  intermediate,  and  long-term  exposures.  None  of  the
compounds examined (with the exception of benzene) had a single 24-hour
measurement that exceeded its acute exposure guideline. The acute inhala-
tion  MRL  for  benzene  was  exceeded  three  isolated  times  in  13  years.  Con-
sequently,  after  reviewing  all  of  the  available  data  (which  includes  94,932
individual 24-hour measurements), we find no evidence to suggest that ad-
verse  health  effects  would  be  anticipated  as  a  result  of  any  of  the  short-
term or peak exposures to VOCs or Metals. The potential for adverse health
effects due to exposure to EPA’s NAAQS compounds will be evaluated in a
future health consultation.

This  conclusion  is  totally  inconsistent  with  the  real  world  experiences  of  many
Midlothian area residents as well as myself and does not recognize the serious limi-
tations  of  the  available  data.  Especially  in  view  of  the  significant  limitations  exist
with the sampling and analysis program in Midlothian.
A.8.,  B.4.,  C.4.,  &  D.1.  The  community  was  concerned  about  asthma,  aller-
gies,  immune  system  deficiencies,  and  other  health  problems  in  adults  as
well as children. Data for these health problems are not routinely collected
in Texas. Therefore, we were not able to systematically assess whether the
levels  of  these  conditions  in  Midlothian  are  different  than  in  other  areas
of the state.

A  basic  concern  here  is  that  asthma,  allergies,  immune  system  deficiencies,  and
other health problems in adults and children are not being evaluated and yet these
kinds  of  adverse  health  effects  are  being  reported  by  Midlothian  residents.  The
TDSHS should conclude no adverse health effects are expected when so many types
of  health  outcomes  are  excluded  from  the  consultation.  Hazardous  emissions  and
toxic contaminants could certainly be contributing or causing adverse health effects
based on the information about many of these pollutants. Did the consultation con-
sider fatalities from asthmatic attacks or allergies?
B.1., B.2., & D.2. Over the years, the Texas Cancer Registry and Texas Birth
Defects  Registry  have  conducted  incidence,  mortality,  and  prevalence  in-
vestigations  to  determine  if  cancer  and  birth  defect  rates  were  higher  or
lower  in  the  Midlothian  area  compared  to  the  rest  of  the  state  (Appendix
D).  No  statistically  significant  elevations  of  specific  or  total  cancers  were
found.  The  prevalences  for  a  few  birth  defects  were  higher  than  expected
and for a few other birth defects were lower than expected based on State
rates.  These  higher  prevalence  rates  were  not  unique  to  Midlothian/Ellis
County but were also observed throughout Health Service Region 3 (which
includes  18  other  counties  primarily  north  and  west  of  Ellis  County).  Be-
cause  of  the  numerous  factors  involved,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  if
these  increases  are  due  to  environmental  exposures  or  differences  in  re-
porting  practices  in  this  region  compared  with  the  rest  of  the  state.  Fur-
thermore,  it  should  be  noted  that  only  three  of  the  99  compounds  with
health based comparison values (i.e., ethylbenzene, 2-butanone, and methyl
isobutyl ketone) listed ‘‘developmental effects’’ as the critical effect (i.e., the
first observable physiological or adverse health effect occurring at the low-

est exposure dose known to produce any effect at all). Hazard quotients for
those  three  compounds  were  0.000352,  0.0000653,  and  0.00000793  respec-
tively,  levels  that  are  far  below  levels  that  might  be  expected  to  result  in
an increased risk for birth defects.

This  conclusion  is  somewhat  illogical,  especially  in  view  of  the  significant  limita-
tions that exist with the monitoring siting, monitor distances, sampling and analysis
program in Midlothian.

General  Findings  #1,  #2,  #3,  and  #4  are  conclusions  that  are  highly  deficient  for

their numerous omissions and flawed considerations of data gaps.

Why am I concerned about industrial air pollution impacting the Midlothian com-

munity and rural residents?

In  the  1990s  I  developed  a  recognition  that  the  industrial  air  pollution  at
Midlothian  was  clearly  causing  significant  adverse  health  effects  to  area  residents
and often their animals based on my previous professional experience as a State in-
vestigator for twelve years at other types of industrial facilities, based on many vis-
its  to  Midlothian  to  investigate  the  conditions  there,  based  on  reviewing  emissions
information and permits for the Midlothian plants, based on analysis of monitoring
information,  and  based  on  interviews  with  many  citizens.  I  emphasize  this  back-
ground because during my professional experience with the Texas Air Control Board
from  1980–1992,  I  investigated  about  1,000  citizen  complaints  of  air  pollution  and
citizens  generally  complained  when  the  industrial  air  pollution  was  so  egregious
that  people  were  suffering  adverse  health  effects  from  something  in  the  air  and
therefore  they  were  strongly  compelled  to  file  complaints  in  order  to  seek  action  to
abate  the  problems.  Once  corrective  measures  occurred  to  reasonably  abate  the  al-
leged  air  pollution  events  effecting  their  health  and  their  residences,  citizens  typi-
cally  complained  less  or  no  more  at  all.  Nonetheless  many  residents  were  trying  to
deal  with  local  toxic  nightmares  of  one  degree  to  another.  In  several  cases,  abate-
ment  of  pollution  events  producing  citizen  complaints  required  months  and  even
several years before the problems were reasonably abated.

In  my  opinion,  the  Midlothian  toxic  nightmare  fits  into  a  pattern  I  have  encoun-
tered  elsewhere  in  Texas.  Since  leaving  the  Texas  Air  Control  Board  in  1992  after
inspecting  industrial  facilities  for  twelve  years  in  West  Texas  and  which  included
a  cement  manufacturing  plant  with  two  cement  kilns,  I  have  been  regularly  inter-
acting with Midlothian residents regarding their health and environmental concerns
with the significant toxic emissions from three local cement kilns and the steel mill.
I  am  familiar  with  the  locations  of  each  of  the  four  plant  sites  and  have  reviewed
emissions  associated  with  the  facilities.  Although  I  previously  worked  for  the  state
environmental  agency  known  as  the  Texas  Commission  on  Environmental  Quality
(TCEQ),  I  have  developed  grave  concerns  about  the  bias  that  routinely  creeps  into
the Agency’s scientific efforts such as certain aspects of the ambient air monitoring
activities at Midlothian and the Agency’s generally egregious failure to protect pub-
lic  health  from  impacts  due  to  exposure  to  a  range  of  toxic  contaminants.  In  addi-
tion,  I  have  experienced  severe  headaches  near  the  TXI  facility  during  brief  expo-
sures to industrial emissions next to the TXI facility, which for me raises troubling
questions  about  the  abysmal  lack  of  regulatory  oversight  by  the  TCEQ  and  a  lack
of concerns about the health and safety of Midlothian residents.

I have reviewed previous reports of November 2, 1995 report: The Screening Risk
Analysis  for  the  Texas  Industries  (TXI)  Facility  in  Midlothian,  Texas,  by  the  Office
of  Air  Quality/Toxicology  and  Risk  Assessment  Section,  Texas  Natural  Resource
Conservation Commission, and a November, 1995 report: The Critical Evaluation of
the Potential Impact of Emissions From Midlothian Industries by the Texas Natural
Resource  Conservation  Commission.  Even  the  January  31,  1996  federal  report  was
severely flawed for similar problems and errors: Midlothian Cumulative Risk Assess-
ment Volume 1, by the Multimedia Planning and Permitting Division, U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency, Region 6, Dallas, Texas.

Risk  assessments  in  Texas  (the  TCEQ’s  Screening  Risk  Analysis  and  the  Sum-
mary  Report,  1995  for  Midlothian,  TX)  are  poor  starting  points  for  future  studies
and actions aimed at protecting public health and the environment due to the innu-
merable flaws, omissions, gaps, poor science and errors. However if viewed as ‘‘tech-
nical  support’’  documents  to  justify  EPA  and  State  declarations  of  no  substantial
risk  to  public  health  due  to  pollution  in  Midlothian,  they  must  be  criticized  due  to
their  many  serious  omissions,  inconsistencies  and  inadequate  or  misleading  anal-
yses.  The  federal  and  State  peer  review  process  is  an  abysmal  failure  in  the
Midlothian case.

Based on de novo analysis at TXI, we conclude that environmental and health im-
pacts  have  and  are  likely  to  occur  in  the  Midlothian  area  from  industrial  activity,
including  the  combustion  of  hazardous  waste  at  TXI.  There  is  high  likelihood  that

the environmental and health impacts are significant, as demonstrated by exposures
and risks that greatly exceed U.S. EPA target exposure levels for a variety of expo-
sure  scenarios  and  source  assumptions  at  a  large  number  of  sites.  Exceedances  of
acceptable  risk  levels  for  children  at  all  residential  locations  is  especially  note-
worthy.

Because  predicted  health  risks  exceed  target  levels,  continued  waste  combustion
at  TXI  requires  more  stringent  controls,  e.g.,  more  effective  air  pollution  control
technology, waste feed limitations, and/or modified operating practices.

The  serious  deficiencies  in  the  Screening  Risk  Analysis  and  Summary  Report  for
TXI  indicate  that  the  ability  of  EPA  Region  6  to  conduct  an  objective  assessment
is  compromised,  and  the  record  demonstrates  significant  concerns  regarding  the  ef-
fectiveness  of  the  EPA  Regions  and  states  like  Texas  in  regulating  combustion  of
hazardous waste at these cement kilns.

The  EPA  Region  with  oversight  for  state  like  Texas  must  be  strongly  criticized
for  the  tendency  to  go  far  beyond  what  is  scientifically  supportable  by  the  existing
data in making sweeping generalizations regarding the present and future safety of
waste  combustion  in  communities.  Statements  with  little  or  a  frail  scientific  basis
show a disregard for the protection of public health, and serve to diminish the EPA’s
and states credibility among the public.

I strongly support concerns of local residents regarding hazardous waste pollution
emitted by cement kilns, which have already impacted communities in the area and
surrounding water and land use. In addition, a potential for more far reaching envi-
ronmental  impacts  to  air  and  water  quality  and  ecological  systems  is  a  significant
concern  of  the  Sierra  Club  and  we  support  the  obvious  need  to  reduce  emissions.

MIDLOTHIAN, TX—COMMENTS ON ATSDR PUBLIC HEALTH CONSULTATION

PREPARED BY: PETER L. DEFUR, PH.D. AND KYLE NEWMAN

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP CONCEPTS, RICHMOND VA 23238

MARCH 11, 2008

Personal information:

We are submitting these comments on the ATSDR Public Health Consultation for
Midlothian, TX out of concern for the role of scientific data in public health assess-
ments  and  how  data  are  used  in  environmental  management.  We  learned  of  this
document  from  colleagues  in  the  area  and  reporters  who  asked  if  we  had  seen  the
report.  Environmental  Stewardship  Concepts  (ESC)  provides  technical  consultation
to  citizen  groups  and  agencies  regarding  the  cleanup  of  contaminated  sites  across
the Nation. At present, our work includes Superfund sites, RCRA sites, State clean-
ups, contaminated rivers under TMDL cleanup, and operating permits for sites that
handle  contaminated  materials.  We  are  intimately  familiar  with  CERCLA  and  the
work  the  ATSDR  has  done  regarding  contaminated  site  health  assessments.  Bio-
graphical  sketches  for  Dr.  deFur  and  Mr.  Newman  are  appended  at  the  end  of  the
comments.

Summary

ATSDR’s classification of this site as an ‘‘Indeterminate Public Health Hazard’’ is
in direct contradiction with the data the Agency presents in the report. Throughout
the document, ATSDR attempts to marginalize or disregard data that indicate that
compounds produce human health risks. ATSDR has more than enough data to clas-
sify the site as a ‘‘Public Health Hazard.’’

The  problems  with  this  assessment  are  numerous,  and  the  most  serious  problem
with the interpretation is that ATSDR discounts their own metrics of health effects,
ignoring the data that exceed health levels. For a number of chemicals, the air con-
centrations are in excess of the health levels, but ATSDR dismisses the excess toxic
chemicals  as  not  a  problem  because  the  number  or  people  harmed  is  small,  despite
the  fact  that  the  risks  exceed  the  levels  used  to  protect  people  from  environmental
threats (i.e., one in a million).

The  most  glaringly  obvious  example  of  ignoring  relevant  data  is  the  disregard  of
aggregate exposures on cancer health effect where ATSDR claimed that even though
risks  exceeded  the  regulatory  threshold,  results  were  inconclusive  since  the  specific
species of chromium measured in the air could not be identified with any certainty.
Since  the  cement  kiln  is  known  to  utilize  hazardous  waste  fuel  in  its  operation,  it
is  hardly  an  unreasonable  assumption  to  assume  that  the  more  toxic  forms  are
being  released.  ATSDR  also  provides  no  information  to  support  the  conclusion  that
if risks from chromium were excluded cancer risks would no longer exceed the regu-
latory  threshold.  ATSDR’s  own  data  do  not  support  this  attempt  at  marginalizing
the risks.

Non-cancer  health  effects  are  dismissed  just  as  easily.  For  example,  when  health
risks  for  manganese  were  found  to  be  unacceptable,  ATSDR  concluded  that  actual
risks  were  low  because  health  screening  values  incorporated  safety  margins  based
on  uncertainties  in  the  toxicity  data.  Lowering  screening  values  based  on  uncer-
tainty  is  common  practice  at  EPA  and  other  agencies  responsible  for  public  health.
Does  ATSDR  disagree  with  this  approach?  The  rational  for  dismissing  risks  from
manganese certainly implies that ATSDR is prepared to replace EPA’s official deter-
mination  and  EPA’s  scientific  expertise  with  their  own.  What  exactly  what  does
ATSDR  believe  the  purpose  of  incorporating  uncertainty  into  screening  values  is?
ATSDR was brought in to evaluate health risks to the community of Midlothian, not
to evaluate how human health screening values are calculated. This dismissal, com-
bined with the approach for evaluating the non-cancer effects of aggregate exposures
that  assumed  compounds  only  target  a  single  organ  system  provides  further  evi-
dence that ATSDR’s evaluation and conclusions are deeply flawed.

Background  levels  are  inappropriately  calculated  and  do  not  reflect  true  back-
ground conditions. Urban concentrations are not appropriate for a rural Texas com-
munity.  ATSDR’s  decision  to  average  these  background  concentrations  from  highly
industrialized areas no doubt further inflated background concentrations. This error
in  methodology  in  turn  led  to  the  dismissal  of  risks  from  a  number  of  toxic  chemi-
cals since they were ‘‘not significantly above background levels.’’

EPA  did  NOT  conduct  a  cumulative  risk  assessment  in  the  document  cited  by
ATSDR,  per  EPA  official  methodology.  The  EPA  conducted  an  exposure  analysis  as

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00118 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

a case study or example for the Cumulative Risk Framework. Dr. deFur chaired the
peer  review  of  the  Framework  document  and  has  subsequently  worked  on  cumu-
lative  risk  assessment  implementation.  The  analysis  at  Midlothian,  TX  did  not  fol-
low the Cumulative Risk Framework, nor could it have followed the Framework be-
cause  the  Midlothian  assessment  was  conducted  before  EPA  finalized  the  Frame-
work.

Cumulative  risk  assessment  (see  the  May  2007  issue  of  Environmental  Health
Perspectives  for  a  mini-monograph  on  cumulative  risk)  requires  more  than  an  at-
tempt  to  combine  the  air  emissions  from  four  major  sources.  A  proper  cumulative
risk  assessment  incorporates  health  status,  community  infra-structure  evaluations,
examination of the history of the sources and much more than was done for the ex-
posure analysis done by EPA at Midlothian, TX more than a decade ago.

The  report  makes  no  attempt  to  deal  with  the  chemicals  for  which  there  are  no
regulatory  numbers,  i.e.,  no  HAL  on  which  to  base  a  health  evaluation.  This  omis-
sion  is  not  even  handled  in  an  uncertainty  section  that  could  be  used  to  make  up
for the data gaps and weaknesses in quantitative evaluation. The report further in-
dicates  an  ability  to  conduct  an  uncertainty  analysis  by  using  a  Monte  Carlo  anal-
ysis,  the  software  for  which  would  provide  a  feature  for  conducting  a  quantitative
uncertainty  analysis.  59  organics  and  28  metals  or  inorganic  chemicals  had  no
health  based  screen  but  16  organics  and  two  inorganics  exceed  background,  per
Table 3a.

The report also fails to grasp the biological basis for the action of multiple chemi-
cals acting over many years on the same people and on the same physiological sys-
tems. The metals are mostly all neurotoxins and affect the brain, especially the de-
veloping  brain  in  fetuses  and  young  children.  ATSDR  could  have  sought  at  least  a
qualitative  analysis  of  the  combined  effects  of  so  many  neurotoxins  over  long  peri-
ods.

It  is  unclear  why  the  conventional  air  pollutants  were  not  included  in  the  anal-
ysis.  These  data  should  be  available  now  for  the  area,  and  for  all  of  Texas.  In  par-
ticular, PM2.5 is most significant because of the toxic chemicals associated with the
particles, and because the particles themselves are deadly. Indeed, recent health in-
vestigations in the peer-reviewed literature indicate there is no threshold for PM2.5,
thus  any  exposure  will  cause  such  problems  as  increased  heart  attack,  increased
stroke, and increased asthma attacks with possible mortality.

The report has no data on dioxins, furans, PCBs, phthalates, pesticides, a number
of other compounds and these are dismissed in the text on page 70, A4, C3 and D3
response.  Cement  kilns  are  known  sources  of  dioxins  and  furans,  according  toe  the
most  recent  EPA  Dioxin  Reassessment  (see  source  and  exposure  section).  Even  if
ATSDR did not bother to spend the money and take air samples, the EPA database
has  sufficient  information  on  sources  to  make  an  informed  estimate  of  dioxin  and
furan  emissions.  As  for  the  other  chemicals,  if  ATSDR  did  not  take  fresh  samples,
then  they  should  have  contacted  EPA  for  data  that  could  be  used  to  make  an  esti-
mate.

The  Monte  Carlo  analysis  of  data  is  not  valid  and  is  intended  to  skew  the  inter-
pretation  of  the  data.  I  doubt  that  this  analysis  was  done  according  to  EPA  guide-
lines for probabilistic assessments, but there are no methods given, so it is not pos-
sible to assess what ATSDR did in the Monte Carlo analysis.

Specific Comments

Fig.  1  and  2:  where  is  the  wind  rose?  Where  are  the  residences?  ATSDR  should

have used wind data from the facilities, the closest weather station or airport.

Enough  time  has  elapsed  since  the  beginning  of  the  investigation  that  ATSDR

could have installed a weather station in an appropriate location in Midlothian.

Page  22:  Why  is  there  not  a  single  list  of  chemicals?  Code  the  measured,  above
and below diction and which no toxicology data. Present display is too hard to inter-
pret—What are the Region III risk based air levels and the numbers from the IRIS
listing? The report needs to provide these two sets of values that are commonly ac-
cepted as applicable around the county.

Page 17: There is a big difference between ATSDR MRL values and the IRIS list-
ings.  ATSDR  MRL’s  are  always  higher,  less  protective,  less  conservative  than  the
IRIS values.

Page  19:  Averaging  the  numbers  from  four  collecting  locations  is  NOT  conserv-
ative Taking the maximum value recorded is conservative. Taking the upper 95 per-
cent C.I. of all values is OK. But the data are so oddly collected in time and space,
and so skewed in distribution that some adjustments should have been made to ac-
count for these patterns and attempt to get some sense of representative data.

Tables 1a/1b show a sampling distribution that is skewed as to be bizarre. Of the
13 sites, one has 9,294 samples in 11 years and 22,956 for organics for six of those

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00119 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

years and another site had five metal samples one year. Organics were sampled and
measured  only  at  four  sites  and  13  years  and  not  all  the  sampling  was  equal.  The
analysis must not give all samples equivalency.

The  95  percent  UCL  of  all  samples  is  not  useful  when  the  data  are  so  clearly

skewed in sampling distribution among locations and across time (years).

The  graphical  depiction  of  actual  data  in  Fig.  3–23  is  useful  and  when  merged
with  data  from  Table  4b  reveals  the  following  information  on  detections  and  levels
that exceed the HAL’s:

114

All of the chemicals listed above show maximum values that exceed the HAC and
the  HAL.  Many  of  these  chemicals  had  many  measurements  in  excess  of  the  con-
centration determined to be without effect—in essence the level for protecting public
health. In several cases, all measurements exceeded the regulatory limit.

The interpretation by ATSDR that there is no health problem defies logic and all
sense of public health assessment. Citizens are exposed to 19 chemicals at times in
excess  of  cancer  guidelines  or  non-cancer.  No  attempt  to  put  these  all  together.  In
spite  of  the  CDC  conclusion  that  these  is  no  safe  lead  exposure,  ATSDR  disagrees
and is not concerned with children developing neurological problems.

The  non-cancer  aggregate  on  p.  68  is  wholly  unsatisfactory  in  method  but  even
where found an HI greater than one, discounted because Manganese is the chemical
and  the  MRL  is  less  than  the  NOAEL  (animals  v.  humans).  So  the  MRL  was  ig-
nored  because  ATSDR  did  not  like  the  answer  or  the  method,  or  some  other  thing.
What about children’s development?

ATSDR  did  not  even  report  or  measure  PM2.5 for  which  there  is  no  threshold  for

health effects.

Cancer  p.  69:  This  statement  is  dismissive  at  best,  callous  and  wrong  at  worst.
The  1x10–4 cancer  threshold  given  by  ATSDR  is  for  Superfund  sites—Does  ATSDR
propose  the  residents  of  Midlothian  live  on  a  Superfund  site?  I  am  sure  there  will
be  both  dismay  and  relief  that  some  agency  has  finally  admitted  the  nature  and
magnitude of the problem. Now, clean it up and make the industries and EPA pay.
This  Monte  Carlo  is  a  joke.  Where  are  the  cumulative  probability  distributions?
Other data need to be displayed compared to ALL regulatory levels. Most such anal-
yses present the probability density functions.

A8—Not measuring does not make the effect go away or diminish.
No soil sample results were presented by ATSDR, only a statement that there was

nothing wrong with the soil.

p. 74 Overall At best, the risks are hard to quantify on the basis of the data pre-
sented.  Most  likely  there  are  clear  health  effects,  both  cancer  and  non-cancer,  from
the air emissions. The non-cancer effects are likely neurological.

No where does ATSDR attempt to determine the effects of a lifetime of breathing

contaminated air—and let’s add on PM2.5 to the toxic chemicals measured here.

Former  State  of  Texas  Air  Pollution  Control  Agency  Regional  Field  Investigator  of
Industrial  Plants  Including  Portland  Cement  Kilns  and  Waste  Incinerators  in
1980s–90s

The EPA’s Sham (Bifurcated) Hazardous Waste Combustor MACT Rule and
Enforcement  Failures  by  EPA  and  State  of  Texas  are  Related  to
Health Hazards from Toxic Waste Incineration in Cement Kilns at
Midlothian, Texas

The sham EPA MACT rule for toxic waste incineration has created a tragic mess
for  communities  like  Midlothian,  TX.  In  addition,  State  and  EPA  enforcement  fail-
ures  have  led  to  over  a  decade  of  unsafe  air  pollution  and  plant  upsets  impacting
citizens  close  to  Midlothian  cement  kilns  that  are  allowed  to  incinerate  up  to  200
million  pounds  a  year  of  hazardous  waste.  Known  kiln  stack  air  pollutants  include
carcinogenic  metals.  Result  is  Midlothian  residents  have  been  living  a  fifteen-year
toxic  nightmare  created  by  broken  regulatory  systems  at  EPA  and  State  of  Texas
both failing to fix dirty air problems. As a former State of Texas air pollution inves-
tigator,  the  Midlothian  situation  is  as  appalling  as  I  have  encountered  in  thirty
years of environmental work in Texas and other states.

Egregious toxic air pollution is due to a bad MACT rule and laxness in fixing the
upsets (24-hour baghouse failures) at Texas Industries, Inc’s (TXI) four cement kilns
burning  hazardous  waste  as  fuels.  In  1996,  EPA  made  a  regretful  decision  to  allow
cement kilns to serve as commercial hazardous waste incinerators and, in hindsight,
EPA’s  decision  was  exceptionally  poor  public  health  policy  for  communities  like
Midlothian’s. It led to a serious failure under the Clean Air Act and RCRA to protect
public  health.  Adding  to  bad  MACT  rule-making  is  EPA  and  Texas  officials  turned
a  blind  eye  to  years  of  repeated  citizen  complaints  of  health  problems,  alleging
something  was  rotten  at  TXI’s  plant  because  residents  and  their  animals  suffered
serious illnesses and their animals often died prematurely. Unsafe levels of air pol-
lution  such  as  toxic  metals  and  other  substances  from  TXI’s  poorly  regulated  toxic
waste incineration are the primary suspect in my opinion.

Incineration  of  wastes  is  a  dangerous  activity,  but  even  more  dangerous  is  cement
kilns  incinerating  hazardous  waste  under  sham  MACT  rules.  Hazardous  waste  in-
cineration  is  inherently  dangerous,  because  combustion  of  such  waste  produces
thousands of toxic byproducts spewed into the air. Cement kilns were not designed,
built  or  intended  for  use  as  commercial  toxic  waste  incinerators  since  EPA  has  a
RCRA program for permitting of toxic waste incinerators. Cement kilns are designed
to  make  cement  and  possess  different  designs  and  operations  from  dedicated  haz-
ardous waste incinerators. The EPA needs new MACT standards and strict enforce-
ment to fix its egregious 1996 MACT mistake.

Why are Cement Kilns unsafe to communities as quasi-hazardous waste in-

cinerators?

Cement kilns were authorized by EPA in a 1996 MACT rule to run under weaker,
less protective MACT standards for Hazardous Waste Combustors (HWC) compared
to hazardous waste incinerators. By bifurcating the MACT rule and adopting weak-
er  incineration  rules  for  cement  kilns,  EPA  turned  a  small  group  of  Cement  plants
(less than 20 percent in the U.S.) into dangerous toxic waste incinerators with high-
er  mass  emissions  of  toxic  substances  than  more  stringently  regulated  hazardous
waste  incinerators.  The  MACT  HWC  rule  set  standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollut-
ants such as mercury, arsenic, cadmium, chromium VI, lead, dioxins, chlorine, total
hydrocarbons  (CO),  particulate  matter,  DRE  of  99.99  percent,  opacity,  etc.  Cement
kilns raced to get RCRA permits to burn toxic waste.

Cement  kilns  burn  up  to  1,000  degrees  hotter  than  incinerators  and  a  concern  is
they  may  burn  too  hot  for  metals  causing  higher  mass  emissions  due  to  greater
metal  volatility  at  higher  temperatures.  Adding  to  this  concern  is  TXI  had  several
baghouse  failures  lasting  for  hours,  and  in  my  view  higher  toxic  metal  emissions
would have likely occurred. Exposure to toxic metals is consistent with some health
problems reported at Midlothian.

March 2009 Status of EPA’s Hazardous Waste Combustor MACT rule:

(1) EPA’s HWC rule is currently under review after Federal Court litigation re-
sulted  in  a  remand  back  to  EPA  for  agency  action  to  fix  the  sham  HWC
MACT rule;

(2) EPA  having  admitted  that  more  than  half  the  MACT  emission  standards
that  the  HWC  rule  contains  are  unlawful,  the  Agency  is  now  deciding
whether to defend the rest or take the whole HWC rule back to fix it;

(3) One  of  the  issues  raised  in  the  HWC  MACT  rule-making  is  whether  EPA
should keep the specially lenient standards that allow cement kilns to burn
hazardous waste; and

(4) EPA  deliberately  set  MACT  standards  at  a  level  that  would  ensure  new
hazardous  waste  burning  kilns  would  be  built  to  keep  burning  hazardous
waste.

In  my  thirty  years  professional  experience  investigating  industrial  plants  and
community  health  complaints  from  neighborhoods  and  downwind  residents,  I
interacted  with  many  communities  in  Texas  seeing  first  hand  how  air  pollution
harms  communities.  I  observed  that  toxic  waste  burning  cement  kilns  like
Midlothian’s  are  especially  dirty  facilities  spewing  out  a  dangerous  soup  of  toxins,
known  carcinogens,  and  harmful  chemical  mixtures  that  are  poorly  known  for
human health effects. Arsenic, aluminum, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nick-
el and selenium are among toxic heavy metals emitted by TXI due to receipt of bulk
hazardous waste and its incineration.

Conclusion:

As a former Texas investigator with 12 years inspecting over 200 industrial plants
a  year  including  waste  incinerators  and  cement  kilns,  I  regard  incineration  as  a
dangerous  activity  based  on  investigations  of  incinerators  with  problems  while
working  for  the  State  of  Texas  air  pollution  control  agency.  Even  more  dangerous
is  cement  kilns  incinerating  toxic  wastes  classified  as  ‘‘hazardous  waste’’  by  EPA.
EPA needs to set more stringent MACT rules for all Hazardous Waste Combustors,
and notably cement kilns and protect public health in these badly impacted commu-
nities. Note attached list of toxic substances associated with hazardous waste incin-
eration.

Midlothian Area Air Quality Part I:
Volatile Organ Compounds & Metals

December 11, 2007

Response: Sal and Grace Mier, Midlothian, Texas: February 03, 2008

Preface:

We  recognize  that  a  great  deal  of  valuable  time,  energy  and  resources  were  ex-
pended  in  the  development  of  this  report.  However,  we  are  generally  very  dis-
appointed that an effort to make such critical judgments regarding the public health
of our community was based on such poor and weak air monitoring data—and even
more  disappointing  was  the  fact  that  the  primary  author(s)  of  this  Report  do  not
appear to have made any serious effort to validate and challenge the quality of this
data but nevertheless were comfortable in making sweeping generalizations as if the
data were sound.

Any  product,  whether  it  be  a  building,  a  document,  or  a  report  such  as  this  is
only  as  good  as  the  foundation  upon  which  it  is  constructed.  Step  one  of  this  as-
sessment should have been to assure the base (the air monitoring data) upon which
all  analyses  for  this  report  would  evolve  was  solid  and  contained  data  that  accu-
rately  reflected  a  complete  picture  of  emissions.  Thus,  it  is  perplexing  and  deeply
disappointing  to  discover  that  the  Texas  Department  of  State  Health  Services
(TDSHS) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) have
produced  a  Public  Health  document  which  was  based  on  deficient  air  monitoring
data, the collection of which was not designed to analyze community impact and not
designed to adequately capture complete emissions.

It  is  not  our  intent  to  imply  that  it  is  ATSDR’s  or  TDSHS’  fault  that  the  proper
air  monitoring  data  upon  which  to  base  a  sound  public  health  assessment  does  not
exist. We assume that it was the best you had available to you. However, we would
like to believe that at step one TDSHS would have attempted to verify the method-
ology incorporated to position air monitors to optimally capture emissions (i.e., popu-
lace,  wind  rose  patterns,  etc.)  and  the  impact  on  the  community  before  they  pro-
ceeded.  When  you  review  selection  of  monitoring  sites,  history,  wind  rose  patterns,
location  of  major  emission  sources,  etc.,  it  is  obvious  scientific  methodology  to  cap-
ture community exposure and impact was not a prerequisite to the placement of the
Midlothian  air  monitors.  Consequently,  TDSHS’  attempt  (with  the  enabling  of
ATSDR)  to  retrofit  a  methodology  and  create  the  illusion  of  adequacy  is  extremely
disappointing  and  makes  a  statement  that  the  true  assessment  of  public  health  in
Midlothian many not have been the major priority.

We  realize  it  is  not  within  TDSHS’  purview  to  dictate  to  TCEQ  a  methodology
for  establishing  an  air  monitoring  system.  However  it  is  TDSHS’  responsibility  to
properly  critique  its  adequacy  for  assessing  public  health.  If  we  cannot  rely
on our public health agencies to do the right thing, rather than becoming a solution
to the problem, they become part of the problem.

We want to emphasize, we do not want you to find a problem if one does
not exist. However, it was our hope that we would get a solid, sound, unbi-
ased  decision  based  on  solid  sound  data.  The  foundation  upon  which  the
findings of this report are based is seriously wanting and flawed.

You  have  already  pointed  out  many  of  the  inadequacies  of  the  monitoring  sites

in this report.

(1) Tayman Drive: No metals and inorganic compounds were collected at
this  site.  (This  is  the  one  site  that  was  best  positioned  to  capture  emissions
from all major industries, but its data was limited.)

(2) CAMS–52:  No  metals  and  inorganic  compounds  were  collected.  (This
site  is  capable  of  capturing  some  emissions  from  TXI  and  Chaparral  Steel,
but  inadequately  placed  for  capturing  the  majority  of  emissions  from  the
other industries.)

(3) CAMS–302:  Metals  and  inorganic  parameters  were  analyzed  from
*PM10. (This site is not in a prevailing wind pattern for any of the emission
sources. No indication that TSP was sampled for metal speciation.)

(4) CAMS–94: Not in a prevailing wind pattern for any of the emission sources.
This  site  was  selected  as  a  background  monitor  for  the  DFW  metroplex  be-
cause it’s south of and upwind from all industries. *No speciation of met-

als from particulate matter greater than PM2.5. (This may be adequate
for  regulatory  purpose;  however,  this  data  does  not  present  an  adequate  pic-
ture  of  local  exposure.)  Monitors  smaller  than  TSP  monitors  are  not  ade-
quate for determining level of heavy metals in ambient air.

TSP monitors were last used in 1998.
Insufficient  data  available  to  evaluate  metals—Mercury  as  an  example:
Reliable data to determine the amount of mercury in the ambient air does not exist.
Note the only readings reflected in the air monitoring data for mercury were based
on  PM2.5 speciation  for  metals.  These  readings  are  for  the  most  part  ‘‘non-detect.’’
Given  the  amount  of  mercury  that  is  self-reported  by  the  industries  these  ‘non-de-
tect’  readings  are  questionable.  In  2004  the  industries  ‘‘self-reported’’  air  release  of
mercury  compounds  per  pounds  as  follows:  Chaparral  Steel—709,  Ashgrove—150,
Holcim—59, TXI—10. This demonstrates: 1) the inadequacy of the monitoring loca-
tion  to  capture  complete  emissions,  and  2)  the  inadequacy  of  relying  on  PM2.5 for
speciation of metals.

*According  to  the  Office  of  Air  Quality  Planning  and  Standards  (OAQPS)  final
staff paper released in December, there is a distinction in TSP, PM2.5 and PM10 and
the adequacy of anything less than TSP to evaluate total lead in ambient air. Refer
to  http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pb/data/20071101¥pb¥staff.pdf  on  page
17 (2.3) Air Monitoring. 2.3.1.1 Inlet Design (last paragraph) reads:

‘‘Sampling systems employing inlets other than the TSP inlet will not collect Pb
contained in the PM larger than the size cutpoint. Therefore, they do not provide
an  estimate  of  the  total  Pb  in  the  ambient  air.  This  is  particularly  important
near  sources  which  may  emit  Pb  in  the  larger  PM  size  fractions  (e.g.,  fugitive
dust from materials handling and storage).’’

With  our  petition,  we  submitted  a  document:  Evaluation  of  The  Screening  Risk
Analysis  for  the  Texas  Industries  Facility  in  Midlothian  by  Dr.  Stuart  Batterman,
et  al.  This  document  evaluates  risk  assessments,  monitoring,  soil  sampling,  etc.,
done  in  Midlothian  and  presented  in  this  consultation  as  activities  engaged  in  the
assessment  of  the  community’s  public  health.  Dr.  Batterman’s  evaluation  reflects
many of our concerns regarding the quality of these activities. Therefore, we are re-
questing that the entire document be considered as part of our comments.

Inhalation is not the only exposure route for toxins in the air. There is no indica-
tion in the analyses that skin absorption and ingestion was factored in when evalu-
ating impact.

Because of the critical deficiencies in the air monitoring data, to comment any fur-
ther  on  the  analyses  of  public  health  impact  of  the  toxins  would  be  an  exercise  in
futility  as  we  believe  it  to  be  a  moot  issue.  Therefore,  we  will  make  comments  on
general issues.

Response to Petitioner and Community Health Concerns
A.1.  While  it  is  true  that  ‘‘all  the  chemicals  being  released  from  cement  kilns  and
steel  mills  have  not  been  fully  identified,’’  this  health  consultation  has  evaluated
237  individual  contaminants  including  119  VOCs  and  108  metals  and  other  inor-
ganic substances.
Response:  There  are  over  1,000  regulated  chemicals;  reviewing  237  is  a  start.  We
appreciate  the  fact  that  this  report  has  concluded  that  we  cannot  disregard  the  po-
tential  impact  of  the  unknown  regarding  the  remainder  of  the  chemicals.  However,
should  this  statement  simply  read,  ‘‘Of  the  over  1,000  regulated  chemicals,  we  are
proud to state we have evaluated 237’’?
A.2.  (1)  It  is  also  true  that,  ‘‘All  the  chemicals  currently  being  incinerated  and  re-
leased  have  not  been  tested  for  carcinogenicity  and  endocrine  disrupting  potential.’’
(2)  However,  based  on  historical  reviews  of  cancer  incidence  and/or  mortality  rates
in Midlothian and Ellis County, no individual or aggregate cancer rates were signifi-
cantly elevated with respect to the rest of the state.
Response:

(1) We  appreciate  your  acknowledgement  of  the  deficiency  in  the  extent  of
chemical testing. We agree with you that many chemicals (as well as heavy
metals) being incinerated have not been tested for endocrine disrupting po-
tential; however, many have been tested or are in the process of being test-
ed.  Recent  scientific  studies  have  raised  red  flags  regarding  endocrine  dis-
ruption potential for many of the toxins already identified and at levels sig-
nificantly lower than the current ‘‘No Observed Adverse Effect Levels’’ used

in  health  risk  assessments.  Recent  science  has  cast  doubt  on  the  current
regulatory standards.

(2) How  does  the  testing  of  chemicals  for  carcinogenicity  and  endocrine  dis-
rupting  potential  correlate  solely  to  cancer  incidence  in  Midlothian?  There
are  illnesses  other  than  cancer  that  are  of  concern.  (a)  Birth  defects  (BDs)
have  consistently  been  significantly  higher  in  Ellis  County  than  the  State
of  Texas  for  the  five  years  (1999  through  2004).  Health  Region  3  has  the
highest  overall  BD  rate  of  all  the  eleven  health  regions  in  Texas—there
appears  to  be  a  common  denominator  here—and  that  is  air  pollution.  Al-
though  we  cannot  say  that  this  higher  rate  of  BDs  is  definitely  attributed
to  air  pollution—we  cannot  definitely  say  that  it  is  not.  (b)  Collection
of  quality  cancer  data  in  the  State  of  Texas  is  still  in  its  developing  stages
of  surveillance.  Unlike  the  BD  data  collection  system,  Texas  collection  of
cancer  data  is  passive.  In  other  words  the  cancer  surveillance  system  has
to  depend  on  the  good  will  of  physicians,  hospitals  and  treatment  facilities
to  report  and  many  of  these  providers  do  not  yet  have  electronic  databases
to  facilitate  this  reporting.  (c) Major  complaints  involve  asthmas  and  other
respiratory  problems  as  well  as  immune  system  deficiencies.  A  peer-re-
viewed study regarding respiratory illnesses in Midlothian, ‘‘The Health Ef-
fects  of  Living  Near  Cement  Kilns;  A  Symptom  Survey  in  Midlothian’’  per-
formed  by  UTMB  and  authored  by  Dr.  Marvin  Legator,  et  al.,  was  sub-
mitted as part of this petition. This study reflected a higher incidence of res-
piratory problems in Midlothian than the control group.

A.4., C.3., & D.3. The community was concerned about the health effects of dioxins,
metals,  and  mixtures  of  compounds.  (1)  Air  data  for  dioxins  are  not  routinely
collected  in  Texas;  therefore  it  was  not  possible  to  evaluate  the  potential  adverse
health  effects  associated  with  these  compounds.  (2)  We  evaluated  available  VOCs
and  metals  air  contaminant  data  with  respect  to  its  potential  for  causing  adverse
health effects in humans due to acute, intermediate, and/or chronic exposures. Only
manganese  exceeded  its  health  based  screening  value  for  chronic  inhalation  expo-
sures. (3) However, based upon a review of the toxicological data, we would not ex-
pect  to  see  adverse  health  effects  due  to  either  long-term  or  short-term  exposure  to
manganese. (4) Mixtures of compounds also were evaluated in this consultation. (5)
Long-term  aggregate  exposures  to  air  contaminants  in  Midlothian  are  not  expected
to result in adverse non-cancer or cancer health effects.

(1) TCDD  is  considered  by  science  to  be  one  of  the  most,  if  not  the  most,  toxic
man-made  substances.  No  safe  level  has  been  identified.  It  has  been
shown  to  disrupt  multiple  endocrine  functions  and  has  negative  outcomes
for the fetus. Although you cannot evaluate it, you cannot disregard it.

(2) Based  on  the  placement  of  the  air  monitors,  it  does  not  appear  assessing
true community exposure was a factor in the collection of the data analyzed.
There are too many deficiencies and weaknesses in the air monitoring data
to make an informed evaluation.

(3) Health issues are surfacing, whether you expect them or not. Some such
as respiratory problems, immune system deficiencies, reproductive and birth
defect  issues  in  animals,  etc.,  remain  ‘‘anecdotal’’  because  our  guardian
agencies  refuse  to  acknowledge  them.  Others  are  well  documented—for  ex-
ample, the continually significantly higher incidence of birth defect rates; in-
creased  respiratory  symptoms  in  Midlothian  documented  by  Dr.  Legator,  et
al.

(4) Did you mean to say, ‘‘Additive effect of some mixtures of compounds also
were  evaluated  in  this  consultation’’?  As  you  acknowledge  only  mixtures
with available HAC values were evaluated—and as if only an additive ef-
fect  were  possible.  There  appears  to  be  an  apparent  false  presumption
that  synergistic  effects  are  not  an  issue.  Synergistic  effects  were  not
evaluated here. Can we assume dioxin (in addition to many other chemicals)
was not considered in the mix? When so many factors are missing from
the  equation,  how  can  you  logically  compute  data  to  make  such  a
strong  declaration,  ‘‘Long-term  aggregate  exposures  to  air  contaminants
in  Midlothian  are  not  expected  to  result  in  adverse  non-cancer  or  cancer
health effects’’? Perhaps this statement should read: If we knew monitoring
data  accurately  reflects  industrial  emissions  and  community  exposure,  and
if  we  assume  there  are  no  synergistic  effects  of  aggregate  exposure,  and  if
we can say no empirical data exists that may indicate otherwise, we could
assume  long-term  aggregate  exposures  to  air  contaminants  in  Midlothian
are not expected to result in adverse non-cancer or cancer health effects.

A.5.,  A.7.,  &  C.1.  In  this  health  consultation,  DSHS  has  analyzed  each  and  every
individual  air  sampling  result  collected  from  all  TCEQ  sampling  locations  in  the
Midlothian area and has not relied on any TCEQ-summarized data. Also, DSHS has
not  relied  on  any  of  the  TCEQ’s  effects  screening  levels  (ESLs)  for  determining  po-
tential  health  risks  associated  with  exposures  to  airborne  contaminants  in
Midlothian.
Response: Thank you for not using the ESLs. It is obvious that you reviewed a large
amount  of  data.  However,  it  is  the  adequacy  of  the  data  that  is  of  issue—not  the
quantity.
A.6.  &  D.4.  (1)  (2)  The  community  was  concerned  that  the  potential  for  adverse
health  effects  may  be  underestimated  due  to  averaging  of  contaminant  data  over
time.  The  initial  screening  of  the  air  data  involved  comparing  the  maximum  con-
centration  for  each  contaminant  to  its  most  conservative  health-based  screening
value.  Contaminants  whose  maximum  concentrations  exceeded  the  most  conserv-
ative health-based screening value were evaluated for acute, intermediate, and long-
term  exposures.  None  of  the  compounds  examined  (with  the  exception  of  benzene)
had  a  single  24-hour  measurement  that  exceeded  its  acute  exposure  guideline.  (3)
The  acute  inhalation  MRL  for  benzene  was  exceeded  three  isolated  times  in  13
years. Consequently, after reviewing all of the available data (which includes 94,932
individual  24-hour  measurements),  we  find  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  adverse
health effects would be anticipated as a result of any of the short-term or peak expo-
sures to VOCs or Metals. (4) The potential for adverse health effects due to exposure
to EPA’s NAAQS compounds will be evaluated in a future health consultation.
Response:

(1) Although not listed here, A.6 Reflects our concern that TCEQ monitors may
not  be  representative  of  actual  exposures  because  collection  sites  may  not
be  optimally  positioned  to  accurately  characterize  air  emissions 
in
Midlothian.  This  remains  our  major  concern  and  the  Achilles  hill  of
this  report.  See  our  prior  discussion  regarding  placement  of  air  monitors.
(2) Averaging  still  remains  a  concern  because  in  your  analyses  this  is
actually  what  was  done—except  for  even  longer  periods  of  time—
years.  The  toxicity  of  a  given  element  depends  upon  when  and  to  whom  it
is  delivered.  A  minute  dose  delivered  at  a  specific  time  in  development  (for
example to the fetus) can yield physical and mental abnormalities quite evi-
dent  at  birth,  or  may  not  be  detected  until  later  in  life.  Exposure  during
fixed  time  frames  when  programming  of  the  endocrine  system  is  occurring
may result in deleterious life altering effects. There are too many questions
and  red  flags  raised  by  scientific  research  related  to  the  short  ‘‘windows  of
vulnerability’’  when  chemical  exposure  can  have  a  negative  impact  on  the
developing  fetus,  a  pregnant  mother  or  the  immune  suppressed.  Time
frames for these ‘‘windows of vulnerability’’ are generally measured in days
and weeks—not years. This extended averaging concept removes life’s
reality from the formula.

(3) ‘‘The  acute  inhalation  MRL  for  benzene  was  exceeded  three  isolated  times
in  13  years  . . .’’—that  you  know  of!  This  is  a  misstatement.  It  should
read,  ‘‘Based  on  the  limited  available  data,  the  acute  inhalation  MRL  for
benzene  was  exceeded  at  least  three  times  in  a  13-year  period  . . .’’  The
data  that  you  have  represents  snapshots  by  the  monitors  of  selected  short
periods in time and in ‘‘select’’ locations. There is a high probability benzene
exceeded  the  acute  inhalation  MRL  also  when  the  monitors  were  not  run-
ning.  There  is  a  higher  probability  that  if  air  monitors  were  methodically
situated to gather data based on prevailing winds, fallout patterns and com-
munity  exposure,  results  would  be  very  different.  At  all  three  sites  (0007,
0015, 0016) the CREG was exceeded 94 percent, 98 percent, 99 percent (re-
spectively)  of  the  time  with  spikes  up  to  118,  512,  319  (respectively)  times
higher  than  the  CREG.  Exposure  to  benzene  is  Midlothian  is  consistent  24
hours per day and long-term. Low-level long-term exposure (over two years)
has  been  shown  to  lead  to  anemia  and  affect  the  immune  system.  A  safe
level  for  the  fetus  has  not  been  established.  Benzene  passes  the  placental
barrier  and  cause  breaks  in  chromosomes  and  change  in  chromosome  num-
ber. Animal studies suggest benzene can cause low-birth weight, bone mar-
row damage, and delayed bone formation in the fetus.

(4) Whether the analyses of the NAAQS data is an exercise in futility or wheth-

on several factors: (a) direction and speed of prevailing wind for each sam-

ple;  (b)  whether  current  science—not  regulatory  levels—are  used  to  deter-
mine  impact  on  public  health  (c)  whether  readings  of  upwind  samples  are
averaged  with  readings  from  downwind  samples  to  dilute  the  impact  (d)
whether air monitors collecting NAAQS data are capable of completely cap-
turing total lead emissions.

A.8.,  B.4.,  C.4.,  &  D.1.  The  community  was  concerned  about  asthma,  allergies,  im-
mune  system  deficiencies,  and  other  health  problems  in  adults  as  well  as  children.
Data  for  these  health  problems  are  not  routinely  collected  in  Texas.  Therefore,  we
were  not  able  to  systematically  assess  whether  the  levels  of  these  conditions  in
Midlothian are different than in other areas of the state.
Response: Would it make any difference (other than to disregard it) if you did have
an assessment of this condition? There appears to be a propensity in this report to-
wards  trivializing  empirical  data.  There  is  no  indication  that  anyone  is  asking,  ‘‘Is
there something we are missing?’’ Note the wording below.
B.1.,  B.2.,  &  D.2.  Over  the  years,  the  Texas  Cancer  Registry  and  Texas  Birth  De-
fects Registry have conducted incidence, mortality, and prevalence investigations to
determine  if  cancer  and  birth  defect  rates  were  higher  or  lower  in  the  Midlothian
area compared to the rest of the state (Appendix D). No statistically significant ele-
vations  of  specific  or  total  cancers  were  found.  (1)  The  prevalence  for  a  few  birth
defects were higher than expected and for a few other birth defects were lower than
expected  based  on  state  rates.  These  higher  prevalence  rates  were  not  unique  to
Midlothian/Ellis  County  but  were  also  observed  throughout  Health  Service  Region
3  (which  includes  18  other  counties  primarily  north  and  west  of  Ellis  County).  (2)
Because  of  the  numerous  factors  involved,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  if  these
increases  are  due  to  environmental  exposures  or  differences  in  reporting  practices
in  this  region  compared  with  the  rest  of  the  state.  (3)  Furthermore,  it  should  be
noted  that  only  three  of  the  99  compounds  with  health  based  comparison  values
(i.e.,  ethylbenzene,  2-butanone,  and  methyl  isobutyl  ketone)  listed  ‘‘developmental
effects’’ as the critical effect (i.e., the first observable physiological or adverse health
effect  occurring  at  the  lowest  exposure  dose  known  to  produce  any  effect  at  all).
Hazard  quotients  for  those  three  compounds  were  0.000352,  0.0000653,  and
0.00000793  respectively,  levels  that  are  far  below  levels  that  might  be  expected  to
result in an increased risk for birth defects.
Response:
(1) Prevalences for only a ‘‘few’’ birth defects were higher? How ‘‘few’’ is few enough?
The attempted play on words here is insulting and appears to be an intent to down-
play  and  obscure  the  significantly  higher  impact  of  birth  defects  in  the  community
and  downwind  neighbors.  This  wording  is  reminiscent  of  the  wording  in  the  infa-
mous ‘‘Cafeteria Talk’’ (see discussion below under section Past DSHS & ATSDR In-
volvement and Data Review). The fact is that the prevalence of total birth defects
for  our  entire  region  is  significantly  higher  than  the  State—that  is  the  point
we have been making. Ellis County’s total birth defect rate is higher than the region
and  has  been  significantly  higher  than  the  State  for  all  years  1999–2003.  And
there were no ‘‘few’’ significantly lower—there was only one in Public Health Re-
gion  3.  In  2002  the  unadjusted  prevalence  for  birth  defect  rates  in  Ellis  County
(689.1) was 186 percent that of Texas (370). In 2002 Ellis County had the high-
est birth defect rate in Public Health Region 3.
(2)  It  is  understandable  if  you  contend  that  because  of  the  numerous  factors  in-
volved  you  cannot  say  environmental  exposure  is  (as  well  as  you  cannot  say  it
is not) involved—but the most perplexing excuse of all is ‘‘because it is not possible
to  determine  if  these  increases  are  due  to  environmental  exposures  or  differences
in reporting practices in this region compared with the rest of the state.’’

According  to  Texas  DSHS  own  website:  http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/birthdefects/

BD¥—data.shtm

‘‘The  Birth  Defects  Epidemiology  and  Surveillance  Branch  (BDES)  uses  active
surveillance. This means it does not require reporting by hospitals or medical
professionals.  Instead,  trained  program  staff  members  regularly  visit  medical
facilities  where  they  have  the  authority  to  review  log  books,  hospital  discharge
lists,  and  other  records.  From  this  review,  a  list  of  potential  cases  is  created.
Program  staff  then  review  medical  charts  for  each  potential  case  identified.  If
the  infant  or  fetus  has  a  birth  defect  covered  by  the  registry,  detailed  demo-
graphic  and  diagnostic  information  is  abstracted.  That  information  is  entered
into the computer and submitted for processing into the registry. Quality con-

trol  procedures  for  finding  cases,  abstracting  information,  and  coding
defects help ensure completeness and accuracy.’’

Unlike the Cancer Registry, Texas BDES Registry does not depend on the good
will of medical facilities nor their ‘‘better reporting practices.’’ Their data collec-
tion  efforts  and  active  surveillance  have  been  statewide  since  1999.  Because  of
the  method  of  collection,  this  database  presents  the  best  empirical  evidence
available to TDSHS to determine whether and where health issues are surfacing.
(3) Furthermore, a multitude of teratogenic and mutagenic toxins being emitted into
the  local  air  are  known  to  cause  birth  defects  and  are  known  endocrine  disruptors.
Current  science  continues  to  produce  evidence  that  raises  questions  regarding  the
adequacy of current levels that are deemed safe. There are many unanswered ques-
tions regarding the synergy of these toxins and their impact on the fetus during cer-
tain  stages  of  development.  There  is  significant  scientific  evidence  surfacing  that
makes it impossible to state with the slightest degree of certainty that these toxins
that  are  known  to  be  endocrine  disruptors  and  known  to  cause  birth  defects  do  not
contribute  to  the  significantly  higher  birth  defects  in  Ellis  and  the  surrounding
downwind  counties  in  Region  3.  This  statement  is  especially  true  when  you
factor in the fact that you do not have a complete picture of the emissions.
B.3. It has been suggested that the Down syndrome cluster reported in Ellis, Hood,
and Somervell Counties in 1991–1994 may have been related to a cesium-137 source
melt  that  occurred  at  Chaparral  Steel  on  September  16,  1993.  This  might  seem
plausible in that one of the risk factors for Down syndrome is exposure of the moth-
er or the father to excessive radiation prior to conception of the child. However, the
time line is not right for this to have been a possibility, because the non-disjunction
of chromosome 21 that results in the manifestations of Down syndrome would have
had  to  have  occurred  prior  to  the  date  of  the  cesium-137  source  melt  for  15  out  of
18 of the reported Down syndrome cases (based on the estimated date of conception
for  each  of  the  children  with  Down  syndrome).  Also,  analysis  of  the  wind  rose  pat-
terns  for  Midlothian  during  a  similar  time  period  to  the  cluster  (i.e.,  1992–94),  re-
vealed  that  the  wind  would  have  been  blowing  in  the  direction  of  one  of  the  Down
syndrome  cases  for  less  than  two  percent  of  the  time  during  the  three-year  period.
Although  the  precise  wind  direction  on  the  exact  day  of  the  source  melt  in  not
known,  the  prevailing  winds  are  out  of  the  SSE  during  September,  which  would
have been blowing toward none of the three Down syndrome cases whose estimated
date  of  conception  was  after  the  cesium-137  source  melt  (two  of  these  cases  were
from  Granbury,  which  is  approximately  44  miles  west  of  Midlothian,  and  the  other
was  from  Palmer  which  is  21  miles  ESE  of  Midlothian).  And  finally,  although  the
exact quantity of radiation released is unknown, modeling of this release as though
the entire source (approximately 89 millicuries of cesium-137) was vaporized and re-
leased  into  the  air  (and  not  caught  in  baghouse  dust  as  most  of  it  was),  indicates
that the additional radiation would not have been detectable above background radi-
ation levels.
1.  No  one  in  this  community  raised  the  issue  regarding  the  two  other  Down  Syn-
drome clusters in Somervell or Hood County. The only issue raised was the clus-
ter  along  FM  664  in  northern  Ellis  County.  Furthermore,  the  lone  ‘‘September
1993’’  incineration  of  cesium-137  correlation  to  this  cluster  surfaced  solely  in-house
at TDSHS.
2.  According  to  the  study,  the  conception  dates  for  the  mothers  in  Ellis  County  oc-
curred  in  March  1991,  February  and  March  1992,  February  and  March  1993  and
February  1994.  Ten  of  the  12  dates  of  delivery  occurred  in  1993  and  the  first  half
of 1994. Documented in the study, cesium-137 was reported to have been in scrap
material that went into the steel mill at Chaparral Steel in Midlothian on at least
two known occasions in 1991–1994. (Note reference above to timeline of exposure.)
The  cluster  along  the  Ovilla  Road  corridor  is  east  and  north  of  Chaparral  Steel.  It
is  accurate  that  this  area  is  not  in  a  prevailing  wind  pattern;  however,  what  per-
centage of the time must the wind blow in this direction for there to be a potential
problem?  [Incidentally,  the  same  concept  regarding  probabilities  and  wind  patterns
should be applied when evaluating the adequacy of the air monitoring data.]
3. The study concluded that the median distance (12 miles) between Chaparral Steel
and  the  cluster  was  too  far  to  be  impacted  by  the  cesium-137  release—and  this  is
also implied in your analyses above regarding cases in Palmer and Granbury. It ap-
pears  that  cesium-137’s  ability  to  stay  aloft  and  travel  long  distances  was  dis-
regarded.

4.  The  point  to  this  issue  has  been  missed.  This  issue  was  raised  to  point  out  the
gaps  in  our  public  health  efforts,  the  inability  or  reluctance  to  associate  health
issues  with  the  environment  and  the  too  often  inaccurate  characterizations  related
to  the  transport  of  constituents  via  air.  In  this  Down  Syndrome  study,  traditional
factors were ruled out—the only factor that was not ruled out was the environment.
In this study, cesium-137 was disregarded because of the distance between the Ellis
County cases and the source. Cesium-137 was raised as an example of a constituent
associated  with  aneuploidy  that  stays  aloft  and  travels  a  long  distance  before  it
reaches  the  ground.  Below  is  an  excerpt  from  our  petition  letter  to  Dr.  Sanchez
dated July 11, 2005.

The  TDSHS  also  conducted  one  Down  Syndrome  study  in  Ellis  County.  A  con-
cerned parent living in northern Ellis county reported that he was aware of eight
children with Down Syndrome that had been born in the immediate area during
1992 to 1994; an additional four cases were identified via the Texas Department
of Health Bureau of Vital Statistics. Eleven were live births and one was a fetal
death. The observed 12 cases were 2.78 times the expected number of 4.32 cases.
This finding was considered ‘‘statistically significant.’’ Unlike the cancer clusters
identified in Ellis County, this cluster was deemed to be ‘‘statistically significant’’
and thus progressed to a higher level of epidemiological investigation. Other tra-
ditional  factors  that  have  been  known  to  be  linked  to  Down  syndrome  were  re-
viewed but ruled out. Unfortunately the study was not designed to review the po-
tential  association  of  environmental  factors  to  Down  Syndrome;  even  though
these are probably the only major variables left to consider. The primary investi-
gator  made  the  point  that  this  cluster  occurred  several  miles  away  from  the
Midlothian  industries  and  thus  it  was  not  likely  that  there  would  have  been  an
association.  This  assertion  could  be  correct  but  again,  keep  in  mind  that  the
study  was  not  designed  to  review  the  impact  of  environmental  factors.  There
could also have been some unlikely occurrences related to wind direction and ve-
locity that could have occurred during the Spring of 1993 when most of the chil-
dren were conceived. Just because the ‘‘prevailing’’ winds are from south to north
doesn’t mean that the winds blow in this direction 100 percent of the time. Also,
some  constituents  are  more  ‘‘persistent’’  than  others.  For  example,  cesium-137
was known to have been incinerated by Chaparral Steel during this time period
and this element has a known association to Down Syndrome and leukemia. The
ATSDR Public Health Statement on cesium-137 also states that this element has
the  ability  to  travel  a  long  distance  in  the  air  before  being  brought  back  to  the
Earth by rainfall and gravitational settlings. Cesium has a half-life of 30 years.
I am not saying that cesium-137 caused the cluster of Down Syndrome,
but this, again, emphasizes not only the gaps in our air monitoring but
the  inaccurate  perceptions  related  to  the  transport  of  constituents  via
air. We do not monitor for all elements and we do not take into account
the ability of certain elements to travel at time, rate and speed beyond
the ability of the monitors to capture their full impact.

Also  note:  Author  of  this  section  (B.3)  still  seems  to  have  an  inaccurate  under-
standing  of  cesium-137’s  persistency  to  stay  aloft  for  long  periods  of  time  and  to
travel  a  considerable  distance  before  being  brought  back  to  earth.  It  is  also  known
that  shielded  cesium-137  (example  a  gauge  encased  in  lead)  was  difficult  to  detect
prior to incineration. Since a certain percentage of cesium-137 continued to show up
in  the  EAF  dust  one  would  question  whether  encased  cecium-137  continued  to  be
incinerated.  Again,  this  is  not  to  say  that  cesium-137  is  the  cause  of  these  Down
Syndrome  babies—but  to  stress  the  gaps  in  the  system.  [Again,  the  concern
about  wind  rose  patterns  expressed  here  is  to  be  complimented.  The  same  attitude
should prevail when assessing the adequacy of the monitoring data.]
C.2.  This  concern  turned  out  to  be  unfounded,  in  that  all  three  CAMS  monitoring
locations  have  collected  air  sampling  data  on  97–99  of  the  119  different  VOCs,
amounting to 60,396 individual contaminant measurements. The CAMS–94 location
collected air sampling data on 52 metals or other inorganics present in PM2.5 partic-
ulate  matter  amounting  to  8,164  individual  contaminant  measurements,  and  the
CAMS–302  location  collected  air  sampling  data  on  24  metals  or  other  inorganics
present  in  PM10 particulate  matter,  amounting  to  4,344  individual  contaminant
measurements.  Only  the  CAMS–52  location  collected  no  air  samples  for  metals  or
other  inorganics  present  in  particulate  matter.  The  confusion  may  have  arisen  be-
cause  the  CAM  sites  only  collect  data  for  the  NAAQS  compounds  on  a  continuous
basis  (i.e.,  24  one-hour-average  levels  per  day).  The  other  contaminants  (VOCs  and
metals)  are  collected  noncontinuously  as  one  24-hour-average  level  collected  once
every six days.

The  concern  that  we  were  given  conflicting  data  by  TCEQ  was  not  un-
founded.  Refer  to  documentation  (e-mails  from  TCEQ)  in  the  petition  file.  The
source  of  confusion  was  not  the  petitioner  but  TCEQ.  However,  you  have  pointed
out one of the inadequacies of the data for 8,164 contaminant measurements for 52
metals  and  other  inorganics  collected  at  CAMS–94  and  4,344  individual  measure-
ments  for  metals  or  other  inorganics  collected  at  CAMS–302.  PM2.5 and  PM10 are
not  adequate  for  determining  the  amount  of  metals  released  into  the  ambient  air
because  the  larger  particulate  matter  to  which  these  metals  bind  are  screened  out.
This  is  particularly  true  in  assessing  local  impact  since  these  larger  particles  have
a  tendency  to  settle  closer  to  the  source.  This  data  may  satisfy  regulatory  obliga-
tions,  but  is  not  reflective  of  true  public  exposure.  Again,  it  is  quality  not  quantity
that should be of essence here.
C.4.  &  D.5.  (1)  Health  problems  reported  in  domesticated  animals  and  livestock
were shared with veterinarians at Texas A&M University. (2) While DSHS does not
have  animal-species-specific  health-based  comparison  values  to  evaluate  the  risks
for  health  effects  in  animals,  many  of  the  health-based  comparison  values  used  in
our  evaluation  of  human  exposures  are  derived  from  animal  studies  and  con-
sequently,  we  would  expect  these  human  HAC  values  to  be  equally  conservative  in
protecting animal health for most common domestic and farm animals.

(1) So you talked to veterinarians at Texas A&M . . . and? You were presented
with  strong  empirical  evidence  that  should  prompt  the  following  questions.
‘‘Are  these  animals  sentinels  to  what  may  be  happening  to  people?
Are there deficiencies in the data we are reviewing? Are we missing
something?’’  The  casual  dismissal  of  this  issue  is  extremely  disconcerting
especially when some local veterinarians are pointing to the environment as
the  potential  source  of  the  problems.  We  would  have  expected  that  the  in-
herent scientific curiosity (and ethical obligation) of the author (s) of this re-
port  would  have  automatically  ‘‘kicked  in’’  and  that  this  issue  would  have
been aggressively pursued.

(2) This  response  avoids  the  issue  as  to  why  concerns  of  health  effects  in  ani-
mals  have  been  surfacing  throughout  the  years.  The  community  was  con-
cerned  that  the  effects  they  were  seeing  in  the  animals  paralleled  health
problems in the community. The question was, ‘‘Are these animals canar-
ies  in  the  coal  mine?’’  Animals  are  exhibiting  immune  symptoms,  repro-
duction  problems,  inability  to  carry  offspring  to  term,  low  birth  weights,

vided with the petition. Levels of toxins in the blood samples and hair anal-
ysis from these animals and manifestation of disease do not match the find-
ings  and  ‘‘assumptions’’  of  this  report.  Again,  ‘‘Are  we  missing  something?’’

An 

Past DSHS Health Data Reviews
(1) Maternal age- and race/ethnicity-adjusted prevalence rates for total birth defects
and  for  hypospadias/epispadias  in  Midlothian  were  significantly  elevated  with  re-
spect  to  Texas.  Similarly  adjusted  prevalence  rates  for  total  birth  defects  and  for
craniosynostosis  were  significantly  elevated  in  Ellis  County  with  respect  to  Texas.
Similarly  adjusted  prevalence  rates  for  total  birth  defects,  craniosynostosis,
microcephaly,  hypospadias/epispadias,  and  obstructive  genitourinary  defects  were
significantly elevated in Health Service Region 3 with respect to Texas. (2) Similarly
adjusted  prevalence  rates  for  pyloric  stenosis  were  significantly  lower  in  Health
Service Region 3 than in Texas as a whole.

(1) We appreciate the fact that you acknowledge significantly elevated birth de-

fect rates in Midlothian, Ellis County and Public Health Region 3.

(2) It is fascinating the number of times you have mentioned this one insignifi-
cant  fact  in  this  report  as  if  though  it  should  trivialize  and  negate  the  pre-
ponderance of evidence that establishes the significantly higher birth defect
rates.

General Findings
1.  One  hundred  thirteen  contaminants  (47  VOCs  and  66  metals  or  other  inorganic
compounds)  had  no  levels  exceeding  the  most  conservative  HAC  value  (or  had  no
reported  levels  above  the  detection  limit).  No  known  health  effects  are  associated
with exposure to these contaminants at the concentrations measured in Midlothian;
therefore, exposure to these contaminants would not be expected to result in adverse
health effects.

Response:  . . .  therefore,  exposure  to  these  contaminants  would  not  be  expected  to
result  in  adverse  health  effects.  Any  respectable  scientist  would  question  and  chal-
lenge  whether  data  reviewed  represents  true  and  complete  emissions  and  commu-
nity  exposure.  Unless  you  can  assure  that  the  data  reviewed  accurately  captures
emissions  and  reflects  community  exposure,  a  statement  like  ‘‘. . .  therefore,  expo-
sure  to  these  contaminants  would  not  be  expected  to  result  in  adverse  health  ef-
fects’’ is without a solid scientific basis.
2.  Health  based  screening  values  were  not  available  for  87  contaminants  (59  VOCs
and  28  metals  or  other  inorganic  compounds).  Additional  information  is  needed  to
determine the public health significance of these contaminants.
Response:  We  appreciate  that  you  acknowledge  screening  values  were  not  available
for a large number of regulated contaminants.
3. Thirteen VOCs had one or more measured level above the most protective health-
based  screening  value.  Three  of  the  VOCs 
(1,1,2-trimethylbenzene;  1,3,5-
trimethylbenzene;  and  m-  and  p-xylene)  had  one  or  more  level  above  the  most  con-
servative  contaminant-specific  non-cancer  screening  value.  Ten  of  the  VOCs  (ben-
zene;  1,3-butadiene;  carbon  tetrachloride;  chloroform;  1,2,-dibromoethane;  1,2-
dichloroethane;  methylene  chloride;  1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane;  1,1,2-trichloroethane;
and vinyl chloride) had one or more level above the most conservative contaminant-
specific cancer screening value.

Response:  Statements  like  ‘‘. . .  had  one  or  more  level  above  the  most  conserv-
ative  contaminant-specific  cancer  screening  value  . . .’’  although  technically  true,
sound  so  trivializing,  especially  when  the  data  shows  that  benzene  levels  exceeded
this ‘‘most conservative screening value’’ over 97 percent of the time.

Again, the only issue is not just what you found. We remain concerned about what
may  not  have  been  identified  due  to  the  inadequacy  of  data  due  to  the  placement
of the monitors. Comment in #1. above applies here.
4.  Fourteen  metals  or  other  inorganic  compounds  had  one  or  more  measured  level
above the most protective health-based screening value. Four of the metals or other
inorganic  compounds  [chlorine  (PM2.5),  lead  (TSP),  manganese  (TSP),  and  man-
ganese (PM10)] had one or more level above the most conservative contaminant-spe-
cific non-cancer screening value. Ten metals [arsenic (PM10), arsenic PM2.5), arsenic
(TSP), beryllium (PM10), cadmium (PM10), cadmium (PM2.5), cadmium (TSP), chro-
mium (PM10), chromium (PM2.5), and chromium (TSP)] had one or more level above
the most conservative contaminant-specific cancer screening value.
Response:  The  response  to  item  #1  above  also  applies  here.  Metal  speciation  based
on PM2.5 and PM10 does not adequately capture true levels of metals in the ambient
air. The last year metal speciation was based on TSP was 1998.

Individual Contaminants—Non-Cancer Health Effects Evaluation

Using  reasonable  maximum  exposure  scenarios,  only  manganese  (both  as  PM10
and  as  TSP)  exceeded  ATSDR’s  chronic  inhalation  MRL  by  a  small  margin.  After
an in-depth review of the toxicological information and the uncertainty factors used
in deriving the chronic inhalation MRL, we concluded that it is highly unlikely that
the  manganese  levels  seen  in  Midlothian  would  result  in  any  observable  adverse
health effects, even after long-term exposure.
Response: The response to item #3 above also applies here.

Individual Contaminants—Cancer Health Effects Evaluation
Exposures Prior to 1982:

Based on ambient air samples collected prior to calendar year 1982, the estimated
excess lifetime cancer risks associated with reasonable maximal exposure to arsenic
(TSP), cadmium (TSP), and chromium (TSP) ranged from 5.38x10–5 (a total of 1 ex-
cess cancer in 18,597 people exposed for 70 years) to 9.30x10–5 (a total of one excess
cancer  in  10,748  people  exposed  for  70  years).  If  these  exposures  were  to  continue
for 70 years, they would pose a low increased lifetime risk for cancer and would not
be expected to result in measurable harmful health effects. Past exposures to these
compounds (prior to 1982) therefore posed ‘‘no apparent public health hazard.’’
Response:  ‘‘Based  on  exposures  prior  to  1982  . . .’’  Are  you  referring  to  the  1981
monitoring  at  site  0001  (City  Hall  roof)?  If  yes,  then  this  should  be  stated  as  thus.
Also, do you believe, based on prevailing wind patterns, this monitor was adequately
situated  to  capture  true  emissions  from  Ash  Grove,  TXI  and  Chaparral  Steel?  It
should  be  pointed  out:  1)  that  ambient  air  data  prior  to  1982  was  limited  to  1981

and  was  scarce  (practically  non-existent)  since  monitoring  for  most  heavy  metals
and VOCS was not done and 2) there is insufficient data to make an informed state-
ment regarding public health impact. And why would we say, ‘‘. . . and if these ex-
posures  continue  . . .’’  when  we  know  they  did  not!—We  know  that  population,
industry, production, mobile sources, etc. increased.

Exposures 1982 through 1992:

This time span should not have been omitted. It should be noted that for a critical
six-year period ambient air data for heavy metals and VOC’s is missing. This period
is  of  particular  concern  to  the  community  because  Ashgrove  unsafely  burned  haz-
ardous  waste  derived  fuel  (HWDF)  from  1986  to  1992.  It  was  not  until  after
Ashgrove’s  ‘‘trial  burn’’  in  1992  that  it  was  determined  that  this  facility  could not
safely  burn  HWDF.  Holcim  went  online  in  1987.  Also,  during  this  period  EPA
issued citations to TXI for violations involving hazardous waste burning.

Exposures 1993 through 2005:

In the entire history of air monitoring in Midlothian, site 007 (Tayman Drive) was
the  only  site  in  a  prevailing  wind  pattern  that  had  the  potential  to  facilitate  cap-
turing data from all industries. There is no data from this site for metals. Data was
collected  only  for  1993–1997.  A  large  number  of  samples  were  collected  upwind  of
all  the  industries  at  CAMS–94.  Averaging  in  readings  from  CAMS–94  when  the
wind is blowing out of the south only serves to dilute the true impact.

Ongoing Exposures:

It  would  be  prudent  to  ask  what  monitoring  is  currently  taking  place.  Are  the
sites  in  position  to  collect  data  that  accurately  reflects  true  public  impact  from  all
sources?  The  response  may  give  insight  to  TCEQ’s  intent  and  attitude  regarding
public health.

Overall Conclusions

We found that the majority of the risks associated with exposure to the chemicals
analyzed in this health consultation were low. However, we are classifying this site
as an Indeterminate Public Health Hazard because further information is needed to
fully  characterize  the  extent  of  the  public  health  hazard  posed  by  air  contaminants
in Midlothian. This classification is based on the following facts:

Overall Response to this section:
Response:  We  truly  appreciate  the  fact  that  it  was  recognized  that  insuffi-
cient data exists to make a solid conclusion whether a public health hazard
does or does not exist. It is quite evident (through no fault of ATSDR or TDSHS)
that  the  collection  of  data  to  assess  public  health  or  to  capture  a  complete  picture
of  emissions  and  true  public  impact  was  not  a  factor  in  the  placement  of  air  moni-
toring  stations.  Consequently,  the  data  is  insufficient  and  inadequate  for  this  pur-
pose. Adequate data does not exist that would permit TDSHS to make a sound anal-
ysis that would warrant a call in either a safe or unsafe direction. Thus, it is quite
disconcerting that an effort was made to assess public health impact to any degree.
This  serves  only  to  discredit  ATSDR’s  and  TDSHS’  purported  mission  to  protect
public health.

Again, it is not our intent to insist a public health problem be identified
if  one  does  not  exist.  However,  it  was  our  hope  that  all  conclusions  or  state-
ments derived regarding the community’s public health would be based on
the recent and developing science and on solid data appropriate to identi-
fying real public exposure.
1.  Sixteen  out  of  59  VOCs  and  two  out  of  28  metals  or  other  inorganic  compounds
for which health-based screening values were not available had average levels above
average background (levels obtained from other areas in Texas and/or the U.S.). Ad-
ditional  information  is  needed  to  determine  the  public  health  significance  of  these
contaminants.
2.  While  individual  contaminants  produced,  at  most,  a  low  increased  lifetime  risk
for cancer and no apparent public health hazard, under the aggregate exposure sce-
nario, total excess lifetime cancer risk for all cancers combined could be interpreted
as posing a public health hazard. However, this conclusion is based on the assump-
tion  that  all  the  chromium  detected  in  the  air  is  of  the  most  toxic  form  [i.e.,  chro-
mium  (VI)],  an  assumption  that  is  inconsistent  with  information  obtained  from
other  areas  of  the  state.  The  relative  proportions  of  chromium  (III)  and  chromium

130

(VI)  will  need  to  be  determined  in  order  to  accurately  define  the  risk  estimate  for
total cancer (all sites combined).
3.  While  this  health  consultation  reviewed  the  majority  of  the  contaminants  meas-
ured  in  Midlothian  air  (119  VOCs  and  108  metals  and  other  inorganics),  EPA’s
NAAQS compounds still need to be evaluated in a future consultation.
4.  There  are  data  gaps  both  in  sampling  locations  and  parameters  of  interest.  No
air data for the analysis of VOCs were collected prior to 1993. Air data for the anal-
ysis  of  metals  and  other  inorganic  compounds  were  collected  at  only  one  location
from  1981  through  1984.  No  air  data  for  these  contaminants  were  collected  prior
to 1981 and none were collected between 1985 and 1992. For the time periods when
air data does exist, data were collected from a limited number of monitoring stations
and  may  not  reflect  conditions  throughout  the  community.  (2)  However,  since  the
major monitoring locations were relatively close to one or more of the primary emis-
sion  sources,  we  do  not  anticipate  that  air  pollutant  levels  for  much  of  the  city
would be too much higher than those observed.
Response:

(1) You  are  right  to  assert  ‘‘. . .  data  was  collected  from  a  limited  number  of
monitoring  stations  and  may  not  reflect  conditions  throughout  the  commu-
nity,’’ because it definitely does not. The only monitoring site capable of
collecting  emissions  from  all  sources  was  0007  on  Tayman  Drive  and  its
data limitations are quite obvious.

(2) ‘‘Relatively close’’ does not suffice. Monitor placement in relationship to
both the source(s) and wind rose patterns should be the criteria. Other than
Tayman Drive (site 007), no monitors were ‘‘close to’’ or in a prevailing wind
pattern  to  adequately  capture  emissions  from  Ashgrove  and  Holcim.  Most
of  the  metals  were  monitored  at  CAMS–94  (site  0015)  which  is  upwind
from all sources. Based on the wind rose patterns this is the one spot that
is least likely to capture data representative of local emissions. The second
site  (based  on  the  wind  rose  patterns)  least  likely  to  capture  emissions  is
CAMS–302 which is west of TXI/Chaparral Steel and south of the other in-
dustries.  The  majority  of  the  VOC’s  were  collected  at  site  0015  and  0016.
Site  0016  is  south  of  Holcim  and  Ashgrove  and  again  (based  on  prevailing
winds)  not  in  an  ideal  location  to  capture  emissions  from  Ashgrove  or
Holcim.  TSP  monitoring  for  metal  speciation  was  limited  before  1998  and
non-existent after 1998.

Recommendations

We have made the following recommendations in response to these findings:

1. As resources allow, research the toxicology literature for contaminants measured
in Midlothian air for which health-based screening values were not available, and
determine  the  potential  public  health  impact  of  exposures  to  these  substances.
2. Collect  additional  ambient  air  samples  from  previously  sampled  locations  to  de-
termine  the  specific  distribution  of  chromium  species  and  to  refine  the  risk  esti-
mates for this contaminant.
Response:  Since  previously  sampled  locations  were  obviously  not  optimally  situ-
ated  to  capture  true  emissions,  is  there  some  logic  to  limiting  collection  to  the
previously sampled site?

3. Evaluate the levels of EPA’s NAAQS compounds in the continuous air monitoring

data.
Response:  Although  we  appreciate  your  efforts,  if  data  was  collected  at  CAMS–
94,  which  is  obviously  not  in  an  ideal  position  to  capture  true  emissions  from
the  industries,  of  what  value  would  it  be  when  assessing  public  health  impact?
It would just be another exercise in futility. Also, it is not possible to determine
a  community’s  true  lead  impact  from  ambient  air  based  on  anything  other  than
TSP readings.

4. Where  possible  identify  and  fill  data  gaps  with  additional  data  from  TCEQ  to
identify any additional air contaminants that might need evaluation and/or sam-
pling.
Response: This report has surfaced deficiencies in the system that should already
have  been  identified  by  TCEQ.  Before  we  proceed  to  identify  additional  air  con-
taminants  that  need  evaluation  we  need  to  get  a  firm  handle  on  the  ones  that
have  already  been  identified.  Current  TCEQ  monitoring  does  not  give  an  accu-

rate  picture  of  total  emissions  and  public  impact.  If  public  health  is  a  con-
cern,  and  if  there  is  a  serious  intent  to  assess  community  impact,  a
methodology  based  on  wind  rose  patterns,  terrain,  emission  sources,
populace, etc., needs to be scientifically devised and implemented.

Actions Completed

Historically,  the  TCEQ  has  collected  a  vast  amount  of  environmental  data  in
Midlothian,  Texas,  including  air  monitoring  samples,  soil  samples,  vegetation  sam-
ples, and others dating back to the early 1980’s.
Response:

(1) Historically  TCEQ  has  shown  that  this  agency’s  ties  and  loyalty  lies  with
industry  and  that  public  health  cannot  be  allowed  to  trump  economic  wel-
fare.  The  lack  of  monitoring  sites  placed  in  and  around  Midlothian  as  a  re-
sult  of  a  methodology  scientifically  based  on  prevailing  winds,  major  emis-
sions  sources,  populace,  etc.,  testifies  to  this.  This  brings  us  to  problems
faced in this consultation—data that does not measure true impact of emis-
sions—data deficient for assessing public health. One can only presume this
was part of the design.

(2) The  Evaluation  of  the  Screening  Risk  Analysis  for  the  Texas  Industries  Fa-
cility  in  Midlothian,  by  Dr.  Stuart  Batterman,  et  al.,  points  out  that  the
monitoring system was deficient considering the scale of industry and waste
combustion. Furthermore this evaluation documents inconsistencies and de-
ficiencies/omissions  in  many  of  the  emissions  and  soil  sampling/analyses.
TCEQ  was  criticized  for  its  tendency  to  go  far  beyond  what  is  scientifically
supportable by the existing data in making sweeping generalizations regard-
ing  the  present  and  future  safety  of  waste  combustion  in  Midlothian.  This
document  was  submitted  with  the  petition  and  should  have  been  a  factor
in the analysis of data quality/adequacy of the TCEQ data.

2.  Earlier  data  were  analyzed  by  the  TCEQ  using  EPA  methodology  and  TCEQ’s
screening levels [4, 10].
Response:  Again,  refer  to  The  Evaluation  of  the  Screening  Risk  Analysis  for  the
Texas  Industries  Facility  in  Midlothian,  by  Stuart  Batterman,  et  al.  This  was  part
of the petition package and part of the evidence submitted. It should not have been
ignored. It critically reviews the documents referred to here [4, 10]. This evaluation
points  out  TCEQ’s  failures  at  times  to  use  EPA  methodology.  It  sheds  a  light  on
serious  omissions,  inconsistencies,  selective  use  of  critical  data;  sampling  times,
techniques  and  locations  inappropriate  to  characterize  impact;  meteorological  and
other  data  not  presented  to  interpret  monitoring  data;  advance  notice  given  to  in-
dustry prior to ambient air monitoring, etc.
3. DSHS staff reviewed summarized monitoring data (1993 through 1995), attended
numerous  meetings  with  TCEQ  staff  and  area  residents,  and  distributed  question-
naires  to  see  if  there  were  consistent  reports  of  odors,  or  signs  or  symptoms  of  ill-
nesses that might be related to environmental pollution.
Response:  See  our  response  below  under  Past  Environmental  Sampling  and  Data
Review regarding actions and results of TDSHS involvement during this period.
4.  The  Texas  Cancer  Registry  analyzed  cancer  morbidity  and  mortality  data  for
Midlothian  and  Ellis  County,  looking  for  any  significant  increases  in  cancer  rates
in this area over the period 1993 through 2002.
5. The Texas Birth Defects Registry analyzed birth defect data for Midlothian, Ellis
County,  and  Health  Service  Region  3,  looking  for  any  significant  birth  defect  ele-
vations during the period 1999 through 2003.
6. ***
7.  DSHS  staff  obtained  detailed  (not  summarized)  TCEQ  air  monitoring  data  from
1981 through 1984 and from January 1993 through March 2005 in an electronic for-
mat  and  created  a  database  of  monitoring  results.  With  the  completion  of  this
health consultation, DSHS has analyzed this data for VOCs and metals or other in-
organic  compounds  and  compared  these  data  to  health-based  screening  levels  pub-
lished  by  ATSDR  and  EPA.  A  conservative  exposure  scenario  was  generated,  and
carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk estimates were calculated, assuming 70-year
lifetime  and/or  chronic  exposures  at  the  *reasonable  maximal  exposure  levels  seen
in the Midlothian area.

Actions Planned
1.  DSHS  and  ATSDR  will  make  this  health  consultation  available  to  the  public,
local  industries,  the  local  government,  and  State  and  federal  health/environmental
agencies.
2.  DSHS  and  ATSDR  will  continue  to  address  the  community’s  health  concerns  re-
lating to air quality.
Response: ‘‘Continue .
.’’? The only way to credibly address a community’s health
concerns  relating  to  air  quality  is  to  have  an  adequate  air  monitoring  system  truly
representative  of  air  emissions  to  which  the  community  is  exposed.  A  scientifically
devised  system  based  on  a  methodology  that  incorporates  prevailing  winds  as  they
relate  to  emission  sources,  terrain,  populace,  etc.  has  never  been  in  place  in
Midlothian. More of the same is of little value.
3. ***
4. DSHS will discuss with TCEQ the potential for determining the specific distribu-
tion of chromium species in Midlothian air. Hopefully we will get a complete picture
of the true emissions first.
5.  DSHS  will  discuss  with  TCEQ  the  potential  for  identifying  and  filling  data  gaps
and  identifying  any  additional  air  contaminants  that  might  need  evaluation  and/or
sampling.

This  community  needs  an  adequate  air  monitoring  system  that  is  based  on  a  sci-
entific methodology designed to capture the total emissions as they impact the com-
munity. Then, and only then will our health agencies be able to make a viable eval-
uation as it relates to public health.
6. DSHS will complete the analysis of the hourly NAAQS data. If this data was col-
lected  at  upwind  monitoring  stations  situated  where  the  majority  of  emissions  will
be  missed,  this  will  be  an  exercise  in  futility.  Also,  unless  data  was  collected  at  a
site(s)  where  (based  on  prevailing  wind)  true  emissions  from  all  sources  are  cap-
tured it will be of little value in assessing impact on public health.

Appendix D—Birth Defects and Cancer Registries Report Summaries
Birth Defects Registry Report Summaries

A Down syndrome cluster investigation released in 1996 reported that the number
of  Down  syndrome  cases  in  Ellis,  Hood,  and  Somervell  Counties  among  deliveries
in 1992 through 1994 was 3.4 times higher than expected based on statewide rates
[74].  Those  results,  which  included  adjustment  for  maternal  age,  were  statistically
significant  at  the  95  percent  level.  While  that  study  did  not  provide  evidence  that
environmental factors were associated with the excess occurrence of Down syndrome
cases, its ability to do so was limited.
Response:  We  take  this  as  a  statement  that  the  environment  could  not  be
ruled out. We agree with this fact. Also, are we talking about three separate clus-
ters here that occurred in Public Health Region 3 during the same period?

In response to a citizen request, the DSHS Texas Birth Defects registry completed
an additional review of birth defects registry data in June 2005 [75]. They examined
the  occurrence  of  48  specific  types  of  birth  defects  as  well  as  ‘‘any  monitored  birth
defect’’ among deliveries to residents of Midlothian, Venus, and Cedar Hill over the
period  from  1997  through  2001  and  compared  those  rates  to  the  state  as  a  whole
(1999  through  2001).  Adjusting  for  maternal  age,  the  prevalence  rate  for  the  occur-
rence  of  one  type  of  birth  defect  related  to  urinary  tract  development  (hypospadias
or  epispadias)  was  approximately  3.7  times  higher  than  the  prevalence  rate  ob-
served  for  Texas  (1999  through  2001).  Adjusting  for  maternal  race/ethnicity,  the
prevalence rate for hypospadias or epispadias was approximately 4.2 times higher
than  the  prevalence  rate  observed  for  Texas  (1999  through  2001).  These  results
were statistically significant at the 95 percent level. Similarly, the prevalence of any
monitored  birth  defect  among  Midlothian  residents  (1997  through  2001),  adjusted
for maternal age, was 1.5 times the prevalence rate for Texas (1999 through 2001),
and the result was statistically significant at the 95 percent level. However, adjust-

133

ing  for  maternal  race/ethnicity,  caused  the  prevalence  ratio  to  drop  to  1.2,  and  the
result  was  no  longer  statistically  significant.  It  is  not  clear  what  effect  if  any  the
different  time  periods  for  data  inclusion  in  Midlothian  vs.  Texas  may  have  had  on
the birth defect prevalence rates.

In  response  to  additional  inquiries  in  August  and  October  2006,  DSHS  Texas
Birth  Defects  registry  completed  an  additional  review  of  birth  defects  registry  data
in  November  2006.  They  examined  the  prevalence  of  total  birth  defects  as  well  as
48 specific types of birth defects in the 11 Health Service Regions of Texas over the
period from 1999 through 2003.

The  standardized  prevalence  ratio  (SPR)  for  any  monitored  birth  defect,  adjusted
for  maternal  age  and  race/ethnicity,  in  Health  Service  Region  3  (which  includes
Ellis  County  and  18  other  counties  in  the  Dallas-Fort  Worth  area)  was  found  to  be
18 percent higher than the state as a whole, and those results were statistically sig-
nificant  at  the  95  percent  level.  Specific  defects  found  to  be  significantly  elevated
at  the  95  percent  level  included  hypospadias/epispadias (SPR=1.14),  obstructive
genitourinary 
and
craniosynostosis  (SPR=1.33).  [Pyloric  stenosis  was  significantly  lower  in  Health
Service  Region  3  than  Texas  as  a  whole  (SPR=0.84).  What  is  not  mentioned  here
is  that  of  all  the  eleven  Health  Service  Regions  in  Texas,  Public  Health  Re-
gion 3 continues to reflect the highest birth defect rate.

(SPR=1.11),  microcephaly 

The  maternal  age  and  race/ethnicity  adjusted  prevalence  rate  (per  10,000  live
births)  for  total  birth  defects  in  Ellis  County  was  483.66  compared  with  360.70
in  Texas  as  a  whole  (SPR=1.34);  these  results  also  were  statistically  significant  at
the  95  percent  level.  Out  of  48  specific  birth  defects  (after  adjustment  for  maternal
age  and  race/ethnicity),  only  craniosynostosis  (SPR=3.61)  was  significantly  ele-
vated in Ellis County with respect to Texas as a whole.

We assume you are referring to the cumulative average rates for periods 1999
through  2003.  An  interesting  point  that  should  be  made  here  is  that  in  2002  the
unadjusted  prevalence  for  birth  defect  rates  in  Ellis  County  (689.1)  was  186
percent that of Texas (370). In 2002 Ellis County also had the highest birth defect
rate in Public Health Region 3.

Cancer Registry Report Summaries

The  Texas  Department  of  State  Health  Services  completed  cancer  incidence  and/
or  mortality  investigations  . . ..  The  incidence  and  mortality  of  the  other  cancer
types  were  not  significantly  different  than  what  would  be  expected  when  compared
to the rest of the state.
Response: This report made a comment that the higher birth defect rates in Health
Service  Region  3  and  Ellis  County  may  be  due  to  the  difference  in  reporting  prac-
tices. Should not the same logic be applied here to the cancer rates. Since, the can-
cer  surveillance  depends  on  the  good  will  of  the  health  providers,  is  it  not  possible
that there is a difference in reporting practice in the rural areas such as Ellis Coun-
ty and your picture of cancer case may not be complete?

Past Environmental Sampling and Data Reviews

Air monitoring data were collected every six days for a variety of metals and other
inorganic constituents of particulates in the Midlothian area sporadically from 1981
to  1984  in  accordance  with  the  national  schedule.  Samples  were  collected  from  the
roof  of  the  City  Hall  on  North  8th  Street  and  were  analyzed  for  approximately  30
different  parameters  including  total  suspended  particulates  (TSP)  adjusted  for
standard  temperature  and  pressure  (STP).  No  air  data  were  available  for  the  time
period from January 1985 through December 1992.

In  1991,  the  TNRCC  initiated  an  environmental  monitoring  program  in  and
around Midlothian to evaluate soil, vegetation, slag, and stack emissions for 18 dif-
ferent  metals  and/or  polychlorinated  dibenzo-p-dioxins  (PCDDs)  and  dibenzofurans
(PCDFs).  Of  the  175  soil  samples  collected  between  1991  and  1995,  one  sample  ex-
ceeded  the  TNRCC’s  soil  screening  level  for  lead  (400  ppm),  and  six  out  of  140  soil
samples  exceeded  the  TNRCC’s  soil  screening  level  for  arsenic  (20  ppm).  Measure-
ments for all other soil metals were below their respective soil screening levels.
Response:  So  based  on  tests  taken  17  years  ago,  excessive  lead  and  arsenic  were
identified in the soil? What were the PCDD levels? This paragraph is silent regard-
ing  findings  in  stack  emissions.  Refer  to  Batterman,  et  al.,  Sections  5.2–5.3.1  anal-
ysis of these soil sampling. See Section 4.3.9 Dioxin/furans. These sections all point
out  questionable  quality  assurance/quality  control  and  raises  questions  regarding
discrepancies between various soil sampling techniques and discrepancies in airflow
and temperatures during stack testing for dioxins/furans, etc.

Additional samples were collected in the vicinity of Chaparral Steel. Results from
these  samples  show  that  two  out  of  22  soil  samples  collected  just  outside  of  the
Chaparral  property  line  exceeded  the  TNRCC’s  soil  screening  level  for  lead  (400
ppm), and one out of 22 soil samples exceeded the soil screening level for cadmium
(40  ppm)  [4,  10].  All  other  soil  metals  were  below  the  TNRCC’s  respective  soil
screening levels.
Response: So excessive levels of lead and cadmium were identified in the soil.

Among  60  soil  samples  tested,  the  Toxicity  Equivalency  Quotient  (TEQ)  for
PCDDs and PCDFs ranged from 0.3–17.9 parts per trillion (ppt); all were below the
ATSDR’s health-based soil guidance level of 50 ppt.
Response:  It  appears  that  dioxin  was  identified  in  all  60  soil  samples.  Dioxin  is  the
deadliest of all man-made chemicals. There is no known safe level for dioxins—what
is ATSDR’s basis for deeming a ‘‘safe’’ level? How is PCDD’s synergistic effects and
the endocrine disrupting factor calculated into this ‘‘safe level’’?

Slag (a by-product of steel production) samples were collected and analyzed for 13

different metals; none exceeded their respective soil screening levels.

As  part  of  the  Chaparral  Steel  special  study,  hay,  wheat,  and  other  vegetation
samples were collected from the fields surrounding the steel mill. With the exception
of aluminum, cadmium, and iron in samples collected in the field immediately south
of  Chaparral,  all  measured  metal  concentrations  were  below  their  respective  max-
imum tolerable levels for cattle.3
Response: So an issue with aluminum and cadmium and iron surfaced? What about
lead?

A  letter  regarding  this  study  from  Dr.  Lund  dated  September  22,  1994  states:
‘‘Soil  samples  collected  from  the  hay  field  contained  elevated  levels  of  cadmium,
manganese,  and  lead.  Cadmium,  manganese,  and  lead  levels  exceeded  the
human  soil  ingestion  comparison  values  by  up  to  2.1,  1.1,  and  6.2  times  respec-
tively.  Human  ingestion  of  soil  from  the  hay  field  with  the  measured  metal  con-
centrations  may  result  in  adverse  health  effects.  In  addition  to  exposure  through
hay  and  vegetation  consumption,  animal  ingestion  of  soil  during  grazing  may  in-
crease the total metal exposure in the animal.

This  letter  also  indicates  eight  additional  hay-bale  samples  (four  0–3  inch  depth
samples and four 3–6 inch depth samples were collected from the rows of hay-bales
stored  at  site  #8.  The  results  show  that  iron,  manganese,  cadmium,  lead  and  tita-
nium  levels  in  surface  samples  (0–3  inch  depth)  were  significantly  greater  than
samples collected from three to six inches within the hay bales. These results sug-
gest aerial deposition of the metals.

Stack samples were collected from all three cement manufacturing facilities while
they  were  burning  different  combinations  of  coal,  HWDF,  and/or  tire-derived  fuel.
The  total  2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin  (TCDD)  Toxicity  Equivalency  Quotient
(TEQ)  concentrations  estimated  for  each  of  the  test  conditions  were  all  below  the
TNRCC’s screening levels.
Response:  Again,  TCDD  is  the  deadliest  of  all  man-made  chemicals.  There  is  no
known  safe  level  for  dioxins—what  level  does  TCEQ  (TNRCC)  ESLs  deem  accept-
able.

Starting in 1993, the TNRCC began collecting air samples for VOCs, particulates,
metals,  and  other  inorganic  compounds  from  various  locations  or  Continuous  Air
Monitoring  Stations  (CAMS)  around  the  city  as  follows  (see  Appendix  E,  Tables  1a
& 1b and Appendix C, Figure 2):

Note: Tayman Drive (007) is the only location (based on prevailing wind patterns)
capable  of  capturing  ambient  air  data  representative  of  public  exposure.  All  others
are upwind of Holcim and Ashgrove. CAMS–94 is upwind of all industries and metal
speciation is based on PM2.5 only. There does not appear to be any TSP monitoring
for metal speciation at any of these sites.

In  1996,  the  United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  conducted  a
cumulative  risk  assessment  using  air  modeling  data  based  upon  estimated  emis-
sions  for  the  industries  in  the  area  during  1985  and  1987  through  1990.  In  their
report, no increased risk for developing cancer or potential for developing non-cancer
health  effects  were  identified  above  the  EPA’s  regulatory  standards  for  acceptable
risk [11].
Response: The EPA assessment was a theoretical mathematical model conducted for
regulatory purposes and should not be relied upon to determine public health impli-
cations. This assessment was based on estimated data that was already 6–11 years
old  when  the  report  was  issued.  How  were  permit  violations  factored  in?  Was
Ashgrove’s  permit  violation  and  failed  efforts  at  burning  of  hazardous  waste  in  its
wet  kilns  factored  in?  Much  has  changed  since  1990.  Production  has  increased.
Types  of  fuels  have  changed.  Incineration  of  hazardous  waste  and  tire-derived  fuel
has  increased.  Mobile  emissions  sources  have  increased.  Population  has  increased.
Emissions  have  increased.  Findings  are  obsolete.  Empirical  data  should  trump
any theoretical estimate.

Past DSHS and ATSDR Involvement and Data Reviews
(2)  Between  1992  and  1995  TDH  and  ATSDR  periodically  evaluated  the  air  moni-
toring data collected in the Midlothian area and attended community meetings. The
majority of samples were below the (1) screening levels considered to be health
protective  at  that  time  [12].  (3)  Although  no  consistent  pattern  of  symptoms  or
illnesses  were  noted  among  area  residents,  there  were  common  complaints  among
the  residents  about  sulfur  odors  and  excessive  dust.  At  the  request  of  various  citi-
zens  groups,  DSHS  Birth  Defects  and  Cancer  Registries  have  analyzed  data  from
Midlothian,  Venus,  Cedar  Hill,  Ellis  County,  and  Health  Service  Region  3  to  deter-
mine  prevalence  rates  for  various  types  of  birth  defects  and  the  standardized  inci-
dence  and  mortality  rates  for  various  types  of  cancers  in  the  aforementioned  areas.
Reports  were  written  by  the  respective  registries  and  summaries  of  those  reports
are presented in Appendix D.

(1) What  do  you  know  about  screening  levels  now  that  you  didn’t  know  then?
It  is  noted  that  data  available  for  review  at  that  time  was  very  limited.
However  VOC  collection  on  Tayman  Drive  indicated  that  94  percent  of  the
benzene emissions exceeded the CREG values and benzene emissions spiked
to  an  acute  chronic  inhalation  RfC  of  20.57  ppb  in  May  1995.  Ashgrove
burned hazardous waste derived fuel (HWDF) from 1986 to 1992. It was not
until after the ‘‘trial burn’’ in 1992 that it was determined that this facility
could not safely burn HWDF. Holcim went online in 1987. Also, it was dur-
ing this period that EPA issued citations to TXI for violations involving haz-
ardous  waste  burning.  Refer  to  ‘‘Cafeteria  Talk’’  below  and  how  this
was trivialized.

(2) The results of these visits that culminated in the infamous ‘‘Cafeteria Talk’’
presented  November  2,  1995  at  the  Midlothian  Middle  School  Cafetorium
was a source of extreme frustration and disappointment for the community.
It was not just in the dismissive and condescending manner in which it was
presented  with  sweeping  generalizations  and  statements  not  appar-
ently supported by science. (Statements like: ‘‘Contrary to some of the
claims you may have heard .
. dioxin exposure is not a significant
health  risk  in  Midlothian.’’  ‘‘ESLs  are  generally  100  fold  or  more
lower  than  the  LOAEL.’’  ‘‘If  it  has  been  determined  that  environ-
mental  pollutants  in  an  area  are  not  consistently  elevated  into  a
range expected to cause adverse health-effects, then it is a foregone
conclusion that differences in disease prevalences cannot be validly
attributed  to  environmental  pollution.’’  ‘‘After  120  years  of  study,
there  are  no  reports  in  the  medical/scientific  literature  linking
Down Syndrome to any sort of chemical exposure or industrial pol-
lution.’’)

.

What  was  even  more  frustrating  was  that  the  community’s  concerns  regarding
lack  of  adequate  monitoring  and  health  problems  surfacing  in  both  the  people  and
the  livestock  were  trivialized.  Results  of  a  poorly  designed  and  analyzed  question-
naire  was  embraced  to  rule  out  the  alleged  asthma  and  breathing  problems  while

the  only  peer-reviewed  study,  The  Health  Effects  of  Living  Near  Cement  Kilns:  A
Symptom  Survey  in  Midlothian  showing  a  higher  incidence  of  respiratory  problems
in Midlothian was totally ignored. A poorly executed and failed Animal Health Sur-
vey  (which  incidentally  did  surface  breeding  problems)  was  abandoned  as  a  failure.
The eagerness to place emphasis on the negative and the dismissiveness of potential
links was very worrisome.

Troubling  are  statements  made  during  this  ‘‘Cafeteria  Talk’’  (like:  ‘‘The  TNRCC’s
environmental  sampling  program  in  Midlothian  has  been  unprecedented!’’  ‘‘Never
before  in  history  has  the  Agency,  or  its  predecessor,  the  Texas  Air  Control  Board
collected  so  many  environmental  samples,  from  so  many  different  media,  from  so
many sampling locations, analyzing for so many different compounds and finding so
few  of  even  the  mildest  of  health  concerns.’’)  This  is  troubling,  not  only  from  the
perspective that the review of the environmental data (especially the air monitoring
data)  reveals  significant  gaps  and  deficiencies  that  should  have  been  obvious  then.
But,  what  is  most  troubling  and  of  great  concern  is  whether  the  author  of
this  ‘‘Cafeteria  Talk’’  could  develop  and  maintain  sufficient  objectivity  to
adequately  evaluate  the  currently  available  data  and  arrive  at  objective
scientific  conclusions  without  bias  in  this  current  public  health  consulta-
tion.

(3) It  was  acknowledged  that  levels  of  sulfur  compounds  were  ‘‘on  occasion’’
above  the  odor  threshold  levels.  The  complaints  regarding  excessive  odors
(not given credence then) were substantiated.

Methods Used in This Consultation

Because of the diversity of the health and environmental concerns and the volume
of data available for the Midlothian area, several health consultations will be need-
ed  to  address  these  concerns.  In  this  consultation  we  reviewed  available  air  moni-
toring  data  with  respect  to  volatile  organic  compounds  (VOCs),  metals,  and  other
inorganic  compounds.  Subsequent  consultations  are  planned  to  address  EPA’s  Na-
tional Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) compounds and (*) consideration of
wind patterns and other weather data. Additional consultations may be added based
on the results of these analyses.
Response: *This holds promise. This same consideration/logic should be applied to
the data analyzed for this report.

Environmental Data

We  reviewed  air  monitoring  data  collected  by  the  TCEQ  in  the  Midlothian  area
from 1981 through 1984 and from January 1993 through March 2005. Air data were
not available prior to 1981 or between January 1985 through December 1992. These
data, collected every six days in accordance with the national schedule, include 119
VOCs  collected  from  four  different  monitoring  locations  and  108  particulate  and
metal parameters collected from 13 different sampling locations (most data were col-
lected from six locations) in and around Midlothian. Current sampling locations and
historical  sampling  sites  are  shown  in  Appendix  C,  *Figures  1  and  2.  Monitoring
site locations and the number of measurements made for VOCs and for metals/inor-
ganic  compounds  at  each  site  are  shown  in  Appendix  E,  Tables  1a  and  1b,  respec-
tively.
Response:  See  our  prior  remarks  regarding  adequacy  of  monitoring  sites  to  capture
complete emissions. *Reference figure 2. The ‘‘artist’’ that overlayed this aerial photo
with  king-size  pictures  of  canisters  should  be  complimented  with  his  ability  to  cre-
ate an illusion. At first glance, one is inspired by what really looks like heavy moni-
toring  in  most  of  the  critical  spots  is  taking  place.  Unfortunately  a  review  of  the
actual air monitoring data and what each of these ‘‘canisters’’ represents, burst the
bubble.

Quality Assurance/Quality Control

We  obtained  detailed  (not  summarized)  ambient  air  quality  data  that  TCEQ  col-
lected in the Midlothian area from May 1981 through March 2005. In preparing this
report,  DSHS/ATSDR  relied  on  the  data  provided  to  us  by  the  TCEQ  and  (1)  as-
sumed adequate quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures were followed
with regard to data collection, chain of custody, laboratory procedures, and data re-
porting. (2) For the purpose of analysis, concentrations reported as ‘‘ND’’ (or not de-
tected) were assigned numerical values equal to one half the detection limit for the
compound.

137

(1) Assuming QA/QC is a leap of faith especially when it comes to public health

issues versus industrial welfare.

(2) When  direction  of  wind  and  fallout  patterns  would  not  support  a  reading
other  than  a  possible  non-detect,  the  non-detect  readings  should  have  been
discarded. Including them only serves to dilute true concentrations and dis-
tort  findings.  This  is  true  even  with  uncustomarily  low  concentrations  re-
flected  on  days  when  (based  on  wind  direction)  a  true  measurement  cannot
be expected.

Health-Based Assessment Comparison (HAC) Values

Media-specific  health-based  assessment  comparison  (HAC)  values  for  non-cancer
health  effects  are  generally  based  on  ATSDR’s  minimal  risk  levels  (MRLs),  EPA’s
reference  doses  (RfDs),  or  for  air,  EPA’s  reference  concentrations  (RfCs).  MRLs,
RfDs, and RfCs (1) all are based on the assumption that there is an identifiable ex-
posure  dose  for  individuals  including  sensitive  sub-populations,  such  as  pregnant
women,  infants,  children,  the  elderly,  or  the  immuno-suppressed,  that  is  likely  to
be without appreciable risk for non-cancer health effects even if exposure occurs for
a lifetime [13].

When  a  substance  is  listed  as  a  carcinogen,  the  lowest  available  HAC  value  usu-
ally  proves  to  be  the  cancer  risk  evaluation  guide  or  CREG.  CREGs  are  based  on
EPA’s  chemical  specific  cancer  slope  factor  (CSF)  and  represent  the  concentration
[for  airborne  contaminants,  usually  expressed  as  micrograms  per  cubic  meter  (μg/
m3)]  that  would  result  in  a  daily  exposure  dose  [expressed  as  milligrams  per  kilo-
gram per day (mg/kg/day)] and theoretical lifetime cancer risk level of one additional
cancer  case  in  one  million  people  exposed  (a  risk  of  1x10–6),  assuming  a  70  kg  per-
son  breathes  an  average  of  20  cubic  meters  (m3)  of  air  per  day  over  a  70  year  life-
time [13].
Response: This does not appear to be true of all constituents. Take lead for example.
An  exposure  dose  that  is  likely  to  be  without  appreciable  risk  for  health  effects
(even  for  short  periods  of  time—such  as  the  ‘‘window  of  vulnerability  for  the  fetus’’
or  for  a  child  in  his  first  few  years  of  life)  has not been identified. A  provisional
RfC) 0.375 μg/m3 was created for evaluating lead based on a long-ago outdated level
(quarterly  average)  1.5  μg/m  to  protect  a  long-ago  outdated  once  acceptable  blood
lead  level  of  30 μg/dl.  In  addition  a  blood  lead  level  of  10 μg/dl  was  used  as  a  com-
parative  value  of  safety  when  all  reputable  science  and  even  CDC  say  it  is  not  an
acceptable level of lead poisoning.

According to the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) final staff
paper,  evidence  of  a  differing  sensitivity  of  the  immune  system  to  Pb  across  and
within  different  periods  of  life  stages  indicates  a  potential  importance  of  exposures
as  short  as  weeks  to  months  duration.  For  example,  the  animal  evidence  suggests
that  the  gestation  period  is  the  most  sensitive  life  stage  followed  by  early  neonatal
stage,  and  within  these  life  stages,  critical  windows  of  vulnerability  are  likely  to
exist.

OAQPS final staff paper indicates (based on peer-reviewed scientific studies) that
for  neurological  effects  on  the  developing  nervous  system),  no  threshold  levels  can
be  discerned  from  the  evidence.  OAQPS  concludes,  ‘‘Thus,  to  the  extent  one  places
weight  on  risk  estimates  for  the  lower  standard  levels,  we  believe  these  risk  results
may  suggest  consideration  of  a  range  of  levels  that  extend  down  to  the  lowest  levels
assessed in the risk assessment, 0.02 to 0.05 μg/m3.’’
OAQPS states: ‘‘In conclusion, staff judges that a level for the standard set in the
upper  part  of  our  recommended  range  (0.1–0.2  μg/m3),  particularly  with  a  monthly
averaging  time)  is  well  supported  by  the  evidence  and  also  supported  by  estimates
of risk associated with policy-relevant Pb that overlap with the range of IQ loss that
may  reasonably  be  judged  to  be  highly  significant  from  a  public  health  perspective,
and  is  judged  to  be  so  by  CASAC.  A  standard  set  in  the  lower  part  of  the  range
would  be  more  precautionary  in  nature  in  that  it  would  place  weight  on  the  more
highly uncertain range of estimates from the risk assessment.’’

In  general,  comparison  values  are  derived  for  substances  for  which  adequate  tox-
icity  data  exist  for  the  exposure  route  of  interest.  All  substances  were  evaluated  as
if  inhalation  was  the  only  exposure  route.  Breathing  is  not  the  only  exposure  route
for  toxins  in  ambient  air  to  enter  the  body.  Toxins  in  the  air  are  also  absorbed  by
dermal  exposure  and  ingestion.  This  is  especially  relevant  to  toxins  that  are  per-
sistent in the environment and are continually re-suspended.

Comparison values may be available for up to three different exposure durations:
acute  (14  days  or  less),  intermediate  (15  to  365  days),  and  chronic  (more  that  365
days). Usually, HAC values based on long-term exposure guidelines are lower (more
conservative)  than  HAC  values  based  on  short-term  exposure  guidelines.  Thus,  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00145 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

138

initial screen usually involves comparing each discrete (i.e., short-term) contaminant
level with a HAC value based on a long-term exposure guideline. What is the acute,
intermediate  or  chronic  long-term  exposure  for  a  fetus  and  its  critical  ‘‘windows  of
vulnerability’’?

Health-Based Screening

Estimation of Long-Term Exposure Levels

Nearly  all  air  samples  collected  for  the  measurement  of  VOCs,  metals,  and  other
inorganic  substances  have  come  from  four  primary  sampling  locations  (1)  (sites
0007,  0015,  0016,  and  0017).  Site  0007  is  approximately  1.2  miles  northeast  of  Ash
Grove  and  1.6  miles  northwest  of  Holcim.  Sites  0015,  0016,  and  0017  are  approxi-
mately  1.6  miles  south,  1.5  miles  north,  and  1.2  miles  northwest  of  the  TXI/Chap-
arral  facilities  respectively  (see  Appendix  C,  Figure  2  and  Appendix  E,  Tables  1a
&  1b).  (2)  Some  Midlothian  neighborhoods  are  located  within  1–1.5  miles  of  one  of
the  major  industrial  facilities  but  most  are  farther  away.  (3)  Since  emission  levels
tend to drop off with distance from the emission source, we expect the levels meas-
ured  at  the  4  primary  sampling  locations  to  be  fairly  representative  of  the  upper
range  of  levels  to  which  the  majority  of  the  residents  of  Midlothian  would  be  ex-
posed.  Of  course  individual  exposure  concentrations  will  vary  from  day-to-day  due
to changes in emission levels, wind speed and direction, and the movement of people
around  the  city.  (4)  Consequently,  we  have  averaged  the  sample  results  from  all
monitoring  sites  together  to  give  the  best  approximation  of  the  average  concentra-
tion  to  which  Midlothian  residents  may  have  been  exposed  over  extended  periods
of time.
Response:  It  appears  these  sites  were  established  in  response  to  needs  other  than
monitoring public health impact.

Tayman Drive (Site 07) was the only monitor logically placed to capture emissions
from  all  industries  and  is  the  only  monitoring  site  that  was  in  a  prevailing  wind
pattern  capable  of  capturing  most  emissions  from  Holcim  and  Ashgrove.  Unfortu-
nately  this  data  is  10  to  15  years  old  and  is  not  reflective  of  current  exposure.  In-
dustrial activity has increased significantly since this data was collected and tire de-
rived  fuel  and  other  hazardous  materials  have  been  added  to  the  mix.  Metals and
inorganic compounds were not sampled here. The majority of the data for met-
als  was  taken  upwind  from  all  the  industries  (site  0015,  CAMS–94).  Site  302  (al-
most directly west of TXI) also is not in line with prevailing wind rose patterns. TSP
monitoring (sites 0001 and 0012) for metals was very limited (six out of the last 27
years)  and  none  in  the  vicinity  of  Ashgrove  and  Holcim.  TSP  monitoring  ended  in
1998.

Site  015  is  upwind  of  the  town,  schools,  and  the  majority  of  the  population.  Fur-
thermore,  it  is  upwind  from  all  industrial  activity.  The  site  was  selected  as  a
background monitor for DFW because of its upwind location and is not in a position
to  capture  the  majority  of  the  local  emissions;  however,  it  could  be  useful  in  deter-
mining what blows in from the Houston area. Metals and inorganics were meas-
ured  here  for  only  three  years  and  these  measurements  were  based  on
PM2.5. The major contribution that data from this site gives to this study is a dilu-
tion of all constituents evaluated and a distortion of true public health impact.

Site 016 is in a position to capture some emissions from TXI and Chaparral Steel,
but  rarely  Holcim  and  Ashgrove.  Unfortunately,  metals  and  inorganic  com-
pounds were not sampled here.

CAMS–302  (Site  0017).  Placed  almost  directly  west  and  just  slightly  north.  This
site is not in a prevailing wind pattern for any of the industries. Metals speciation
was from PM10—no TSP monitor.

The  argument  ‘‘. . .  we  expect  the  levels  measured  at  the  four  primary  sampling
locations to be fairly representative of the upper range of levels to which the major-
ity  of  the  residents  of  Midlothian  would  be  exposed’’  could  hold  weight:  1)  if  data
was  more  representative  of  emissions  from  all  industries  (specifically  Holcim  and
Ashgrove)  and  at  monitoring  sites  established  based  on  prevailing  wind;  2)  if  all
data  was  simultaneously  collected  to  represent  the  same  level  of  industrial  activity
for a given period; and 3) if there were not so many inconsistencies in the data (ex-
ample: metal sampling). Furthermore, readings captured at CAMS–94 (and possibly
CAMS–302) should be disregarded when the wind is blowing out of the south. These
readings do not capture community exposure and generally serve only to dilute true
impact.

‘‘. . . Since emission levels tend to drop off with distance from the emission . . ..’’
This  is  not  true  of  all  emissions.  Some  constituents  can  stay  aloft  and  travel  for
great  distances  and  when  and  where  they  come  down  depends  on  many  variables.

For many constituents, it depends on what size PM to which they attach. Take lead
(or  any  heavy  metal)  for  example.  Lead  attached  to  the  larger  particulate  matter
(greater than PM10) has a tendency to settle in closer proximity (depending on wind
speed) to the source while lead attached to PM2.5 becomes aerosol and can stay aloft
indefinitely and travel long distances. If you were analyzing data collected on a TSP
monitor, this statement could to some degree hold more weight. Unfortunately no
TSP monitoring took place at the sites listed above.

‘‘. . .  Of  course  individual  exposure  concentrations  will  vary  from  day-to-day  due
to changes in emission levels, wind speed and direction, and the movement of people
around the city.’’ While this is true, some locations are more heavily exposed to total
emissions  for  longer  periods  of  time  than  others.  Locations  located  closer  to  Holcim
and  Ashgrove  realize  a  higher  impact  of  total  emissions.  Unfortunately,  monitoring
adequate  to  capture  these  exposures  is  severely  limited  and  missing  for  many  con-
stituents  (example  heavy  metals).  There  could  be  some  logic  in  evaluating  impact
on  communities  within  1.5  miles  of  the  individual  monitoring  sites—but  only  for
those  constituents  that  were  adequately  monitored  and  tend  to  settle  close  to  the
emission  site.  There  are  too  many  variances  (created  by  time  lapses,  increases  in
production  and  TDF  increases,  lack  of  metal  analysis,  limited  data  capturing  emis-
sions  from  industries  on  north  side  of  Midlothian,  etc.)  in  monitoring  sites  to  aver-
age across the board.

‘‘. . .  Consequently,  we  have  averaged  the  sample  results  from  all  monitoring
sites together . . ..’’ Since when do people get exposed to ‘‘averages’’? People are ex-
posed to whatever is in the air at the time. What is the average ‘‘window of vulner-
ability’’ for a fetus?

Evaluating Exposure to Chemical Mixtures

While  risk  assessments  often  focus  on  identifying  risks  from  single  contaminant
exposures,  real-life  situations  such  as  the  one  in  Midlothian  involve  the  simulta-
neous exposure to multiple contaminants. Consequently, in addition to assessing the
risks associated with exposure to individual contaminants, we also evaluated aggre-
gate  exposures  from  multiple  contaminants  for  the  Midlothian  area,  both  for  non-
carcinogenic and for carcinogenic effects.

Simultaneous  exposures  to  multiple  chemicals  may  have  additive  effects  (where
the  combined  effect  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  effects  of  each  agent  alone),  syner-
gistic  effects  (where  the  combined  effect  is  greater  than  the  sum  of  the  effects  of
each agent alone), or antagonistic effects (in which one substance interferes with the
effects of another producing a less toxic effect), when compared to a single chemical
exposure  alone.  In  general,  aggregate  exposures  to  multiple  chemicals  at  levels
below  their  thresholds  for  minimal  effects  would,  at  most,  be  expected  to  produce
a  simple  additive  effect.  Consequently,  aggregate  exposures  to  multiple  chemicals
were evaluated assuming an additive effect. It was also assumed that all compounds
contributing  to  the  exposure  were  elevated  in  unison  and  that  people  were  exposed
to all the chemicals at the same time.
Response: ‘‘Consequently, aggregate exposures were evaluated assuming an additive
effect’’?  How  does  this  tie  in  to  your  explanation  of  synergistic  effects?  Does  ‘‘Con-
sequently . . .’’ mean consequently synergistic effects are not real? The bottom line
is that total aggregate effects were not really evaluated unless you have ‘‘assumed’’
synergistic effects and endocrine disruption activity are not possible.

Chemical Mixtures and Non-Carcinogenic Effects

To  estimate  the  potential  public  health  significance  of  simultaneous  exposures  to
multiple chemicals, we tabulated all of the critical effects for each contaminant list-
ed  by  the  EPA  on  the  Integrated  Risk  Information  System  (IRIS)  database  which
were the basis for deriving the RfD or the RfC. We also tabulated all of the critical
effects listed by the ATSDR in their Toxicological Profile series which were the basis
for  deriving  their  inhalation  MRLs.  The  95  percent  UCL  of  the  estimated  average
daily  exposure  dose  was  divided  by  the  appropriate  health-based  value  to  calculate
the 95 percent UCL on the Hazard Quotient (HQ) for a particular critical effect (e.g.,
CNS  effects,  developmental  effects,  liver  toxicity,  etc.).  HQs  from  multiple  contami-
nants  known  to  produce  critical  effects  of  a  similar  nature  or  on  the  same  organ
system  were  summed  to  arrive  at  the  Hazard  Index  (HI)  for  each  critical  effect  as
a  result  of  exposure  to  the  chemical  mixture.  Aggregate  exposures  with  an  HI  less
than  1.0  were  considered  to  be  without  appreciable  risk  for  adverse  health  effects.
Aggregate exposures with an HI greater than 1.0 were subjected to further analysis
to determine the potential public health significance.

Response: How are synergistic effects and endocrine disrupting activity factored into
this formula?

Chemical Mixtures and Carcinogenic Effects

To  estimate  theoretical  excess  lifetime  cancer  risks  associated  with  simultaneous
exposures  to  multiple  carcinogens,  we  tabulated  all  of  the  cancer  critical  effects  for
each contaminant listed by the EPA on the IRIS database which were the basis for
deriving  the  IUR  or  the  oral  slope  factor  (if  applicable).  For  each  contaminant,  the
95 percent UCL on the estimated average daily exposure was multiplied by the IUR
to  calculate  the  theoretical  lifetime  risk  of  developing  certain  types  of  cancer  (e.g.,
lung, liver, kidney, etc.), assuming a continuous, 70-year exposure. Risks from expo-
sures  to  multiple  contaminants  known  to  produce  the  same  type  of  cancer  were
summed  to  obtain  an  estimate  of  the  total  excess  risk  of  developing  that  cancer  as
a  result  of  exposure  to  the  chemical  mixture.  Finally,  all  of  the  individual  cancer
risks  were  summed  to  obtain  a  cumulative  cancer  risk  estimate.  Aggregate  expo-
sures  with  a  cumulative  cancer  risk  estimate  less  than  1x10–4 were  considered  to
be  without  appreciable  risk  for  adverse  health  effects.  Aggregate  exposures  with  a
cumulative cancer risk estimate greater than 1x10–4 were subjected to further anal-
ysis to determine the potential public health significance.
Response: How are synergistic effects and endocrine disrupting activity factored into
this  formula?  If  you  have  not  factored  in  these  two  facets,  do  you  believe  you  have
scientifically evaluated aggregate exposures?

Child Health Considerations

In  communities  faced  with  air,  water,  or  food  contamination,  the  many  physical
differences  between  children  and  adults  demand  special  emphasis.  Children  could
be at greater risk than are adults from certain kinds of exposure to hazardous sub-
stances.  Children  play  outdoors  and  sometimes  engage  in  hand-to-mouth  behaviors
that  increase  their  exposure  potential.  Children  are  shorter  than  are  adults;  this
means  they  breathe  dust,  soil,  and  vapors  close  to  the  ground.  A  child’s  lower  body
weight  and  higher  intake  rate  results  in  a  greater  dose  of  hazardous  substance  per
unit  of  body  weight.  If  toxic  exposure  levels  are  high  enough  during  critical  growth
stages, the developing body systems of children can sustain permanent damage. Fi-
nally,  children  are  dependent  on  adults  for  access  to  housing,  for  access  to  medical
care,  and  for  risk  identification.  Thus  adults  need  as  much  information  as  possible
to make informed decisions regarding their children’s health.

Health-based  assessment  comparison  values  such  as  the  MRLs,  RfDs,  and  RfCs
used  in  this  health  consultation  are  all  based  on  the  (1)  assumption  that  there  is
an  identifiable  exposure  dose  for  individuals  including  sensitive  sub-populations
(such as pregnant women, infants, children, the elderly, or the immuno-suppressed)
that  is  likely  to  be  without  appreciable  risk  for  non-cancer  health  effects,  even  if
exposure  occurs  for  a  lifetime.  Each  of  these  HAC  values  employs  an  uncertainty
factor  designed  to  account  for  human  variability  or  sensitive  sub-populations,  in-
cluding children. (2) With regard to CREG values and potentially increased carcino-
genic  risks  for  children,  only  one  of  the  carcinogens  observed  in  Midlothian  air
(vinyl  chloride)  is  listed  by  the  EPA  as  having  a  mutagenic  mode  of  action.  Using
the  recommended  additional  age-dependent  adjustment  factors  of  10  for  exposures
occurring  between  birth  and  2.0  years,  and  three  for  exposures  occurring  between
the  ages  of  2.0  and  6.0  years,  we  would  anticipate  a  31.3  percent  higher  lifetime
risk than that calculated by conventional methods.

(1) This should read: ‘‘Though there is evidence to the contrary that an iden-
tifiable  exposure  dose  of  many  toxins  exists  for  individuals  including  sen-
sitive sub-populations (such as pregnant women, infants, children, the elder-
ly,  or  the  immuno-suppressed)  that  is  likely  to  be  without  appreciable  risk
for  non-cancer  health  effects,  even  if  exposure  occurs  for  a  lifetime,  we  pro-
ceed  in  our  assumptions  as  if  there  were.’’  Note:  prior  discussions  regarding
lead.  ATSDR  has  consistently  flown  in  the  face  of  science  by  condoning  a
blood-lead  level  of  10  μgL  as  an  acceptable  level  of  lead  poisoning  though
science has established (and CDC concurs) that it is not.

(2) The point to this statement is obscure and the information is confusing. Are
you  saying  that  cancer  is  the  only  issue  of  concern  for  children?  A  large
number  of  the  toxins  in  Midlothian  air  are  known  fetotoxins,  neurotoxins,
endocrine disrupters, teratogens. Mercury, lead, arsenic, benzene, cadmium,
chromium  have  all  been  associated  with  mutagenic  effects.  Safe  levels  for
the fetus for most of these chemicals has not been determined.

ADDENDUM To Prior Comments Submitted February 3, 2008

MIDLOTHIAN AREA AIR QUALITY PART I:
VOLATILE ORGAN COMPOUNDS & METALS

DECEMBER 11, 2007

Prepared by Sal and Grace Mier, Midlothian, Texas
As addendum to February 03, 2008 Comments
Date: March 09, 2008

Suggestions:

For  reasons  outlined  in  our  prior  comments,  air  monitoring  data  collected  in
Midlothian by TCEQ cannot be scientifically justified as adequate to determine pub-
lic  health  implications.  Therefore,  it  is  suggested  that  Under  Section  Results  and
Discussions  (starting  on  page  22  up  through  67)  all  ‘‘Public  Health  Implications’’
based on this air monitoring data be removed.
Response to Petitioner and Community Health Concerns (starting on page 5):
All  responses  reflecting  an  analysis  based  on  TCEQ  air  monitoring  data  collected
in Midlothian should be revised to reflect adequate data was not available to arrive
at a scientific conclusion.
General Findings (page 8) should reflect that TCEQ air monitoring data collected
in Midlothian was inadequate to arrive at a scientific conclusion of public health im-
pact  of  toxic  emissions  in  the  air.  All  conclusions  using  TCEQ  air  monitoring  data
as a basis should be deleted.
Individual  Contaminants—Non-Cancer  Health  Effects  Evaluation  (page  9):
This section should reflect that TCEQ air monitoring data provided insufficient data
to  evaluate  non-cancer  health  effects.  All  analyses  based  on  TCEQ  data  should  be
deleted.
Individual  Contaminants—Cancer  Health  Effects  Evaluation  (page  9):  This
section  should  reflect  TCEQ  air  monitoring  data  collected  in  Midlothian  was  inad-
equate  to  arrive  at  a  scientific  conclusion  of  public  health  impact  of  toxins  in  the
ambient air. All analysis based on TCEQ air monitoring data should be deleted.
Aggregate Exposures—Non-Cancer Health Effects (page 9): This section should
reflect that due to absence of critical data such as dioxin/furans, VOCs, heavy met-
als  (especially  mercury  and  lead),  questions  regarding  critical  windows  of  vulner-
ability, questions regarding endocrine disruptive activity and the overall inadequacy
of  the  air  monitoring  data,  aggregate  exposures  and  the  impact  on  public  health
could not be scientifically evaluated.
Aggregate Exposures—Cancer Health Effects (page 10): This section should re-
flect  that  due  to  absence  of  critical  data  such  as  dioxin/furans,  heavy  metals  (espe-
cially mercury and lead), questions regarding critical windows of vulnerability, ques-
tions  regarding  endocrine  disruptive  activity  and  the  overall  inadequacy  of  the  air
monitoring  data,  aggregate  exposures  and  the  impact  on  public  health  could  not  be
scientifically  evaluated.  (Note:  Estimate  on  cancer  risks  considering  only  chromium
(VI) is understated.
Overall Conclusions (page 10): Basis for classification of an ‘‘Indeterminate Public
Health Hazard’’ should be revised to reflect all deficiencies that preclude a scientific
public  health  evaluation.  Inadequacy  of  TCEQ  air  monitoring  data  for  assessing
public  health  precludes  such  statements  as,  ‘‘We  found  majority  of  risks  associated
with exposure to chemicals analyzed in this health consultation as low.’’ All conclu-
sions  and  inferences  relating  to  public  health  based  on  the  TCEQ  air  monitoring
data should be removed.

1. Paragraph 1. It should be reflected that the number of VOCs and metals ex-
ceeding background levels could be significantly higher if adequate air moni-
toring data were available.

2. Paragraph  2.  ‘‘. . .  Under  the  aggregate  exposure  scenario,  total  excess  life-
time  cancer  risk  for  all  cancers  combined  could  be  interpreted  as  posing  a
public  health  hazard  . . .’’  This  scenario  is  understated  by  inferring
that  this  interpretation  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  all  chro-
mium  detected  in  the  air  is  chromium  (VI).  A  major  omission  is  the
impact  of  the  deadliest  of  all  man-made  toxins—dioxins/furans.  The
statement  regarding  a  possible  public  health  hazard  should  reflect
this  omission.  This  statement  should  also  reflect  an  assumption  was
made that all data reviewed adequately reflected a complete picture
of toxic exposure (which it does not) and there are no synergistic ef-
fects  of  these  aggregate  exposures.  (Have  other  pathways  for  expo-
sure such as dermal or ingestion been factored in?)

3. Paragraph 3. The adequacy of the EPA NAAQS to capture true public expo-
sure and adequacy for evaluating public health should be scientifically evalu-
ated before proceeding.

4. Paragraph 4. ATSDR should request assistance of a reliable independent sci-
entist  for  help  in  evaluating  the  TCEQ  Midlothian  air  monitoring  for  ade-
quacy  of  capturing  public  impact  and  for  adequacy  in  evaluating  the  public
health  of  the  community.  An  assessment  for  the  need  for  additional  and  ap-
propriate monitoring could also be recommended.

Recommendations (Page 11):

Please recommend that TCEQ establish a monitoring system that captures a com-
plete  picture  of  toxic  emissions  from  all  sources  and  data  adequate  for  monitoring
public health.

Actions Under Way (page 12):

Action  to  effectuate  an  adequate  monitoring  system  in  Midlothian  should  be  un-
dertaken.  DSHS  should  discuss  with  TCEQ  a  methodology  for  establishing  a  moni-
toring  system  that  captures  emissions  from  all  major  sources  and  produces  data
adequate for monitoring public health.

Conclusions (Starting on page 72):

All findings should reflect the inadequacy of TCEQ air monitoring data to capture
total  emissions  and  the  inadequacy  for  evaluating  public  health.  All  findings  based
on this inadequate data should be withdrawn.

Aggregate Exposures—Non-Cancer Health Effects (page 73)

The  CNS/neurological  effects  are  grossly  understated.  How  were  dioxins  factored
in? How were synergistic effects factored in? Up-wind readings for mercury give you
for all intent and purpose zero data on mercury. By the sheer nature of the cement
industries and incineration of hazardous waste and tire-derived fuel, you know that
the emissions of these toxins are significant. It is not becoming of an agency charged
with public health to make such a deficient statement. This statement should be re-
vised to reflect the deficiencies in the data reviewed.

**********

Below  are  corrections  to  statements  made  in  our  original  comments  sub-
mitted  on  February  3,  2008.  It  is  requested  that  you  substitute  statements  as
amended below. The change is highlighted in bold.

On page 5 in paragraph (3) the reference to the time benzene exceeded the CREG,

the sentence should read as follows:

At  all  three  sites  (0007,  0015,  0016)  the  CREG  was  exceeded  94  percent,  98  per-
cent,  99  percent  (respectively)  of  the  time  with  spikes  up  to  118,  512,  319  (respec-
tively) times higher than the CREG.

On page 11 under response to item 3, the first sentence should read:
Statements  like  ‘‘. . .  had  one  or  more  level  above  the  most  conservative  contami-
nant-specific  cancer  screening  value  . . .’’  although  technically  true,  sound  so

trivializing,  especially  when  the  data  shows  that  benzene  levels  exceeded  this  ‘‘most
conservative screening value’’ over 97 percent of the time.

On  page  19  under  paragraph  in  first  paragraph  (1)  response,  sentence  should

read:

However  VOC  collection  on  Tayman  Drive  indicated  that  94  percent  of  the  ben-
zene  emissions  exceeded  the  CREG  values  and  benzene  emissions  spiked  to  an  acute
chronic inhalation RfC of 20.57 ppb in May 1995.

**********

During these last couple of years, there has been much speculation in the commu-
nity  regarding  the  delay  of  this  report.  The  initial  anticipated  completion  period  of
three  months  was  stretched  to  six  months,  and  then  went  on  indefinitely  for  over
two years on an apparent merry-go-round between TDSHS and ATDSR.

Speculation  for  the  delay  ranged  from  ‘‘possible  political  interference’’  to  ‘‘a  delay
is  a  form  of  non-response—a  method  to  keep  the  community  at  bay  for  as  long  as
possible.’’  TDSHS’  reason  for  delay  was,  ‘‘The  data  was  so  comprehensive  that  it
would take a very long time to complete the analyses.’’

It  was  obvious  to  the  community  from  the  onset  that  based  on  the  positions  of
the air monitors, data collected by TCEQ would not be adequate for assessing public
health. It was our naı¨ve hope that adequate data based on sound science was being
collected.  As  it  turned  out,  this  was  not  the  case.  This  consultation  was  based  on
readily available data that could be pulled into Access and/or Excel databases along
with  the  comparison  data  and  easily  manipulated  to  generate  the  results  provided
in  this  report.  Readily  available  references  were  used.  Prior  TDSHS  documents
should  have  been  easily  accessible.  Community  visits  were  completed  in  the  first
three  months.  Can  you  provide  some  logic  to  the  delay?  Or  was  this  delay  just  an
effort to keep the community pacified and at bay?

Final Comment:

We  truly  appreciate  the  fact  that  ATSDR/TDSHS  acknowledged  that  a  finding
less than an ‘‘Indeterminate Public Health Hazard’’ is not appropriate. However, the
basis  for  this  finding  omits  the  most  glaring  and  pertinent  deficiencies—the  lack  of
valid  data  to  make  an  appropriate  health  assessment  of  any  kind.  Premature  as-
sessments  (based  on  deficient  air  monitoring  data)  of  a  finding  of  ‘‘no  apparent
health hazard’’ for many of the constituents evaluated in this consultation are very
disconcerting.

I  refuse  to  be  so  cynical  to  imply  that  ATSDR/TDSHS  are  not  concerned  about
public health, because there are many professionals working for these agencies who
have  demonstrated  their  commitment.  However  there  appears  to  be  a  pervasive  in-
stitutionalized  philosophy  and  culture  that  does  not  allow  public  health  issues  to
surface  if  they  will  trump  economic  and  industrial  goals.  Your  agencies,  profes-
sionals  and  the  communities  to  which  you  have  a  public  health  obligation  deserve
better than this.

Addendum #10

144

A Review of ‘‘Emissions Data from Midlothian Industry’’

NOT ‘‘JUST STEAM’’

FOR THE TEXAS SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE,

SEPTEMBER 9TH, 2008

In  the  summer  of  2008  Amanda  Caldwell  and  Susan  Waskey,  two  University  of
North  Texas  Geography  graduate  students,  did  something  no  one  had  previously
done.  They  added  up  all  the  emission  reports  submitted  to  State  and  Federal  Gov-
ernment by the three cement plants and adjacent steel mill in Midlothian. Their re-
port,  ‘‘Midlothian  Industrial  Plant  Emission  Data’’  was  the  first  to  try  to  document
the  cumulative  impact  from  what  is  the  largest  concentration  of  smokestack  indus-
tries in North Texas.

Although  there  has  been  an  operating  cement  plant  in  Midlothian  since  1960,
emission  data  was  only  available  from  the  state  beginning  in  1990,  and  from  the
EPA beginning in 1988. The last available data from both sources is currently 2006.
Besides  providing  an  idea  of  the  total  pollution  burden  imposed  by  these  facilities
for  the  first  time,  Caldwell  and  Waskey  also  spotlight  the  differences  in  reported
volumes  of  air  pollution  when  industry  submits  emissions  reports  to  the  State
versus  the  Federal  governments.  The  two  databases  reveal  some  interesting  con-
trasts  in  tracking  16  years  of  air  pollution  emissions  that  call  for  closer  examina-
tion.

Caldwell  and  Waskey’s  work  definitively  puts  to  rest  the  oft-repeated  unofficial
explanation  by  the  companies  and  their  boosters  that  that  plant’s  emissions  are
‘‘just steam.’’ In fact, pollution from the smokestacks of these facilities is the largest
industrial threat to public health in North Texas, and has been for decades.

2. The Emissions Reports
A) USEPA’s Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)

Toxic  Release  Inventory  reports  are  generated  by  industries  as  required  by  the
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), enacted in 1986.
According to the EPA,

‘‘EPCRA’s  primary  purpose  is  to  inform  communities  and  citizens  of  chemical
hazards in their areas. EPCRA Section 313 requires EPA and the states to an-
nually collect data on releases and transfers of certain toxic chemicals from in-
dustrial  facilities,  and  make  the  data  available  to  the  public  in  the  Toxic  Re-
lease  Inventory  (TRI)  . . .  EPA  compiles  the  TRI  data  each  year  and  makes  it
available  through  several  data  access  tools,  including  the  TRI  Explorer.’’
(USEPA 2008)

The release data used in this project are self-reported by each facility, and neither
the  quality  of  the  data,  nor  the  quantities  reported  should  be  assumed  to  be  pre-
cisely accurate.

Caution  should  be  taken  in  interpreting  trends  from  the  TRl  reports  as  the  list
of  ‘‘reportable’’  chemicals  has  changed  over  the  years.  Since  its  inception  in  1987,
the list of toxic chemicals that must be reported has doubled to more than 650, with
most  of  the  additions  occurring  in  1995.  Also,  numerous  changes  have  been  made

to  the  list,  including  de-listing  some  chemicals  and  modifying  reporting  thresholds
of others.

B)  Texas  Commission  on  Environmental  Quality’s  Annual  Contaminant

Summary Reports

The  second  half  of  the  data  collection  effort  was  focused  on  the  State  of  Texas’
Contaminant  Summary  Report.  Again,  like  the  federal  data,  2006  is  the  latest  re-
porting  year  for  which  data  are  available.  Reported  data  earlier  than  1990  do  not
exist  from  the  state,  according  to  a  conversation  with  the  Emissions  Assessment
Section  Manager  at  TCEQ.  Data  was  also  not  collected  in  1991  at  the  State  level,
for reasons not readily known to the TCEQ manager.

The  Contaminant  Summary  Report  contains  data  detailed  in  three  sections:  Cri-
teria  Emissions  Total,  Contaminant  Summary  Report,  and  Hazardous  Air  Pollut-
ants  (RAPS)  Summary  Report.  The  Criteria  Emissions  Total  section  lists  data  for
seven ‘‘Pollutant Classes,’’ namely:
PM2.5—suspended  particulate  matter  of  a  size  2.5  microns  or  less  (requirement

added in 2000),

PM10—suspended particulate matter of a size 10 microns or less,
VOC—volatile organic compounds,
CO—carbon monoxide,
NOΧ—nitrous oxides,
SO2—sulfur dioxide, and
PB—lead.

These  requirements  originate  from  the  National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards
(NAAQS),  established  by  the  USEPA  under  the  direction  of  the  Clean  Air  Act,  and
annual reporting is further required under the Texas Clean Air Act.

The Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPS) Summary reports chemicals for which both
the  federal  and  State  Clean  Air  Act  requires  annual  reporting.  Data  from  both  the
Criteria  Emissions  Total  and  HAPS  Summary  Report  were  included  in  this  report.
The  third  section  titled  ‘‘Contaminant  Summary  Report’’  is  a  catch-all  listing  of
chemicals  required  by  a  mix  of  requirement,  sources,  including  Criteria  Emissions,
HAPS,  permit,  and  other  requirements,  according  to  the  TCEQ  manager  Kevin
Cauble.  Chemicals  unique  to  this  listing  are not included  in  this  project’s  analysis.

3. The Volume of Pollution

Between 1990 and 2006, the three cement plants and steel mill reported to State
and/or  Federal  Government  that  their  facilities  released  approximately  one  billion
pounds—986,509,069—of  harmful  air  pollution  into  the  North  Texas  skies,  includ-
ing:
10,000 pounds of Mercury
91,000 pounds of lead
Over seven million pounds of ‘‘ EPA-classified toxic’’ air pollution
Approximately 35 million pounds of respirable Particulate Matter
Over 134 million pounds of global waning gases
Over 300 million pounds of smog-forming Nitrogen Oxide
Approximately 400 million pounds of acid rain causing Sulfur Dioxide

That’s  an  average  of  over  61  million  pounds  of  air  pollution  released  every  year,
7000 pounds an hour, 117 pounds per minute, two pounds per second over 16 years.
And  yet,  the  position  of  the  Texas  Committee  on  Environmental  Quality  is  that
Midlothian has some of the cleanest air in the state.

Because it’s heavier than the gaseous pollution released by the Midlothian plants,
Particulate  Matter  contaminated  with  metals  and  other  combustion  residues  will
usually  fall  out  within  10  miles  of  the  source,  with  the  heaviest  concentrations  in
the  areas  most  consistently  downwind  of  the  cement  plants,  or  in  very  close  prox-
imity of the plants themselves.

A  10-mile  radius  around  the  Midlothian  cement  plants  would  include  portions  of
Arlington,  Cedar  Hill,  DeSoto,  Grand  Prairie,  Mansfield,  Midlothian,  Red  Oak,  and
Venus, and incorporate 314 square miles.

34,903,092  pounds  of  PM10,  or  soot,  from  all  four  facilities  is  enough  to  deposit
111,156  pounds  on  each  square  mile  in  that  10-mile  radius  over  the  last  16  years.

146

Almost  all  of  the  Lead  and  Mercury  released  by  the  cement  plants  is  emitted  as
Particulate Matter pollution. 91,000 pounds of lead is enough to deposit 289 pounds
of  the  poison  on  each  square  mile.  10,103  pounds  of  Mercury  is  enough  for  32
pounds to be deposited on each square mile in that same area.

334,816,276  pounds  of  Nitrogen  Oxide  is  the  equivalent  smog-forming  pollution

from the annual emissions of nine million automobiles.

402,516,432 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide is the equivalent to the SOΧ released by 20

coal plants in a year.

4. Toxicity of Selected Pollutants

A) Particulate Matter, or soot, is toxic in its own right, more so when other toxins
are  hitching  a  ride  on  its  surface—almost  all  of  the  Lead  and  Mercury  released  by
the  cement  plants  is  emitted  as  Particulate  Matter  pollution.  Soot  from  engines,  or
industrial processes like cement manufacturing is much smaller than the sand dust
or  fire  soot  which  evolution  equipped  human  beings  to  expel.  Because  it’s  smaller
it remains deep in the lungs, doing damage.

In the last few years, PM pollution has been linked by scientists to lung damage,
asthma,  heart  attacks,  strokes,  blood  clots,  brain  cancer,  genetic  damage,  and  Par-
kinson’s  Disease.  Toxicologists  specializing  in  PM  pollution  believe  to  be  no  ‘‘safe’’
level of exposure to PM pollution.

B)  Mercury  does  not  decompose  or  exit  the  environment  once  it’s  been  released
into  the  atmosphere.  It  is  deposited  back  onto  the  ground,  where  it  persists  in  soil
and water, and bio-accumulates in fish and wildlife.

According to leading scientists, as little as 1/24th of an ounce of Mercury can con-
taminate  a  20-acre  lake  and  all  the  fish  in  it.  Using  this  measuring  stick,  10,000
pounds  of  Mercury  is  enough  to  contaminate  over  133,000,000  20-acre  lakes.  Joe
Pool  Lake  is  within  five  miles  of  all  the  Midlothian  cement  plants  and  steel  mill,
and the closest plant is within two miles of the Lake.

C) Lead and lead compounds can be highly toxic when eaten or inhaled. Although
lead is absorbed very slowly into the body, its rate of excretion is even slower. With
constant exposure, lead accumulates gradually in the body. It is absorbed by the red
blood  cells  and  circulated  through  the  body  where  it  becomes  concentrated  in  soft
tissues, especially the liver and kidneys. Lead can cause lesions in the central nerv-
ous system and apparently can damage the cells making up the blood-brain barrier
that protects the brain from many harmful chemicals. Most of the leading scientists
specializing in lead poisoning believe there is no safe level of exposure to lead—that
is  no  level  that  is  not  capable  of  causing  some  neurological  or  physiological  effect.
D)  According  to  the  Agency  of  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry,  long-term

exposure to Sulfur Dioxide

‘‘can  affect  your  health.  Lung  function  changes  were  seen  in  some  workers  ex-
posed to low levels of sulfur dioxide for 20 years or more. However, these work-
ers  were  also  exposed  to  other  chemicals,  so  their  health  effects  may  not  have
been from sulfur dioxide alone. Asthmatics have also been shown to be sensitive
to the respiratory effects of low concentrations of sulfur dioxide.
Animal studies also show respiratory effects from breathing sulfur dioxide. Ani-
mals exposed to high concentrations of sulfur dioxide showed decreased respira-
tion, inflammation of the airways, and destruction of areas of the lung.

5. Specific Plants and Pollutants

147

A) TXI
TOTAL AIR POLLUTION 1990–2006: 336,979,556 pounds

TXI is the largest cement plant, and largest industrial facility among the four ex-

amined in this analysis, so it’s not surprising it would lead in total pollution.

In general, the amount of TRI chemicals released to the environment through the

air by TXI spiked in the year 2000, to over 1.2 million pounds.

This  coincided  with  TXFs  bringing  the  fifth  cement  kiln  into  operation  at  their
Midlothian  plant.  Subsequently,  TRI  releases  stabilized  at  a  level  lower  than  one
million pounds after 2000, but at a significantly higher rate than in the past (more
than 480,000 lb/yr).

In  1999,  reporter  Steve  Brown  wrote  in  The  Dallas  Morning  News  that  TXI  had
promised  that  this  $200  million  expansion  to  add  the  5th  kiln  to  their  operation
‘‘would  not  increase  pollution,’’  and  it  would  ‘‘have  advanced  pollution  controls  that
would keep the project from harming air quality’’ (Brown 1999). The data from both
the  EPA  Toxic  Release  Inventory  and  the  State  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  reports
show  a  different  outcome.  Air  releases  from  both  reports  are  higher  than  prior  to
2000.

B) Holcim
TOTAL AIR POLLUTION 1990–2006: 307,966,836 pounds

Holcim’s  TRI  releases  and  state  emissions  inventory  consist  mostly  of  Toluene
(404,288  lbs.),  Benzene  (232,109  lbs.),  Sulfuric  Acid  (172,145  lbs.)  and  unspeciated/
mixed Xylenes (145,982 lbs.). Holcim has also had lesser amounts of on-site landfill
releases over the years.

Holcim’s  State  air  emissions  (HAPS  emissions  consist  mostly  of  Toluene  (508,429
lbs.), Benzene (329,279 lbs.), Xylenes (248,103 lbs.), and Hydrochloric Acid (196,566
lbs.).

C) Ash Grove
TOTAL AIR POLLUTION 1990–2006: 263,141,444 pounds

Ash  Grove’s  toxic  air  emissions  consist  mostly  of  sulfuric  acid  (872,185  lbs)  and
hydrochloric acid (171,473 lbs). On-site landfill releases are also of note , consisting

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00155 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

148

mostly  of  Magnesium  and  Magnesium  Compounds  (1,903,018  lbs.),  and  smaller
amounts of Chromium (34,464 lbs.) and Lead (8224 lbs.).

The State Air Emissions Inventory (HAPS) shows that most prevalent toxic chem-
ical released over the 17-year reporting period was Hydrogen Chloride (334,655 lbs.)
Ash  Grove’s  state  Criteria  Emissions  Releases  show  that  Sulfur  Dioxide  (SOΧ)  and
Nitrous Oxides (NOΧ) were the most prevalent components of these emissions. Fur-
thermore, there is a discouraging upward trend in released amounts of Sulfur Diox-
ide during the recent past.

What  remarkable  about  Ash  Grove’s  numbers  are  that  they’re  so  large  for  the
smallest cement plant. It has more SOΧ, NOΧ and PM10 than Holcim, which is twice
its size.

D) Ameristeel
TOTAL AIR POLLUTION 1990–2006: 89,655,098 pounds

Most air releases were Zinc (352,076 lbs), Lead (47,238 lbs) or Manganese (46,904
lbs). Chaparral’s releases are primarily ‘‘off-site,’’ with zinc releases over the 17-year
period approaching 50 million pounds.

The  State  air  emissions  inventory  (HAPS)  consist  mostly  of  Manganese  Dioxide
(58,609 lbs.) or PM10–Manganese Dioxide (72,583 lbs.), and Lead Oxide (50,337 lbs.)
or  PM10–Lead  Oxide  (38,237  lbs.).  The  Nitrous  Oxide  (NOΧ)  component  of  those
emissions seems to beholding steady at one million pounds per year.

6. These are Underestimates

The  fact  that  there  is  absolutely  no  emissions  data  from  either  EPA  or  the  state
for the first 30 years of industrial operations in Midlothian—including the first four
years of hazardous waste-burning at two cement plants—means that the large num-
bers reported here for the first time are inherently vast underestimates of the total
pollution  burden  produced  by  heavy  industry  in  the  town  since  1960.  This  is  any-
thing but a comprehensive review.

Even  when  records  begin  in  1990,  there  are  large  discrepancies  in  the  data  re-
ported  to  both  the  State  and  Federal  governments.  TRI  and  State  emissions  data
for  several  of  the  companies  were  not  reported  for  many  of  the  years  during  the
project time period:
Chaparral did not report TRI data in 1990.
Holcim did not report TRI data for the years 1990–1999.
Ash Grove did not report TRI data for the years 1990 and 1993–1995.

Holcim  did  not  report  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  data  to  the  state  for  the  years

1990–1999.

It is unlikely that these facilities were not releasing anything worthy of reporting
to either the USEPA or State databases during these years. Omissions such as these
ensure  that,  even  during  the  period  when  records  do  exist,  this  analysis  only  gives
a glimpse into the actual pollution burden caused by the four facilities.

7. Contradictions in Data

A  cursory  examination  of  EPA  air  release  data  in  Figure  56  (Total  Air  Releases
per Firm 1990–2006) and TCEQ air release data in Figure 60 (Total Hazardous Air
Pollutants per Firm 1990–2006), show strikingly different results. For this reporting
period,  the  EPA  data  shows  TXI  to  be  the  firm  with  the  largest  amount  of  toxic
chemicals released to the air (5,287,384 lbs.), while the state’s data show Holcim to
be the largest emitter of hazardous air pollutants (1,507,663 lbs).

According to the plants’ TRI reports, there were almost 48,000 pounds of lead air
pollution  released  by  all  four  facilities  over  the  entire  16  years,  versus  the  over
90,000  pounds  of  lead  the  same  plants  reported  sending  up  their  stacks  to  the
TCEQ and its predecessors during the same period.

According  to  the  plant’s  TRI  reports,  there  were  approximately  5000  pounds  of
Mercury  air  pollution  released  by  all  four  facilities  from  1990  to  2006  versus  the
approximately 10,000 pounds of Mercury air pollution reported to the state over the
same time.

Even within the same reporting system, the method used to calculate or estimate
reported  quantities  for  various  chemicals  may  have  differed  from  firm  to  firm  and
year to year, making comparisons or trend analysis difficult. Take the case of Vola-
tile  Organic  Compounds  at  the  cement  plants  that  are  literally  across  the  street
from  each  other.  When  Holcim  finally  began  reporting  volumes  for  TRI  in  2000,  it
immediately  cited  large  numbers  for  VOCs  such  as  Toluene,  Xylene,  and  Benzene.
It  has  been  Holcim’s  position  that  these  VOCs  come  from  the  limestone  itself  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00156 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

149

testing  done  over  the  last  three  years  generally  supports  this  conclusion.  On  the
other  hand,  neither  TXI  nor  Ash  Grove  have  ever  reported  the  large  numbers  of
these  VOCs  that  Holcim  has,  despite  mining  and  using  the  same  Midlothian  lime-
stone. The result is that even though Holcim did not report ANY emissions for nine
of  the  16  years  covered  in  this  analysis,  it  is  the  largest  historical  VOC  polluter  in
the  study,  with  VOC  totals  that  are  at  least  five  times  that  of  the  next  cement
plant.  Is  Holcim’s  limestone  that  much  different  than  the  other  two  plants,  or  are
TXI and Ash Grove under-reporting their emissions?

Some  of  these  calculation  differences  could  be  investigated  further,  as  could  the
apparent  reporting  gaps  (missing  data)  from  some  of  the  firms.  Also,  the  company-
to-company differences in what chemical substance get reported in which section of
the  annual  report  to  the  state  could  be  evaluated.  Those  chemicals  from  the  state’s
Contaminant Summary Report block that are not included in the HAPS or Criteria
Emissions blocks of data could also be scrutinized for inclusion in this dataset.

BIRTH DEFECT INVESTIGATION REPORT

Birth Defects Among Deliveries to Residents of

Midlothian, Venus, & Cedar Hill, Texas, 1997–2001

PREPARED JUNE 29, 2005 BY MARY ETHEN, EPIDEMIOLOGIST
BIRTH DEFECTS EPIDEMIOLOGY AND SURVEILLANCE BRANCH

TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES

BACKGROUND

A  community  member  expressed  concern  over  birth  defects  in  Midlothian  (Ellis
County),  Venus  (Johnson  County),  and  Cedar  Hill  (Ellis  and  Dallas  Counties),
Texas. The community member also expressed concern about pollution from cement
kilns  in  or  near  these  three  communities  and  a  steel  mill  in  or  near  Venus,  Texas.

METHODS

Case Definition

The areas of interest are south of Dallas and Fort Worth. The Texas Birth Defects
Registry began collecting information in this part of the state with deliveries in Jan-
uary  1997,  and  the  most  recent  delivery  year  for  which  the  registry  has  completed
data collection is 2001.

Based on this information, a case was defined as an infant or fetus . . .

the registry;

• with  any  of  48  specific  birth  defects,  or  with  any  birth  defect  monitored  by
• born between January 1997 and December 2001;
• born to a mother who resided in Midlothian, Venus, or Cedar Hill at the time

of delivery.

Each community was examined separately from the other two communities.

Case Finding

The Texas Birth Defects Registry was searched to find cases meeting the case def-
inition.  The  mother’s  place  of  residence  at  the  time  of  delivery  was  based  on  infor-
mation  reported  on  the  child’s  birth  or  fetal  death  certificate,  when  available.  If  a
birth  or  fetal  death  certificate  could  not  be  found,  the  mother’s  place  of  residence
at the time of delivery was based on information in the Texas Birth Defects Registry
that had been abstracted from hospital medical records.

Occurrence Evaluation
Unadjusted Prevalence: Cases in the registry were used to calculate prevalence rates
per  10,000  live  births  for  48  specific  birth  defects  and  for  infants  and  fetuses  with
any  birth  defect  monitored  by  the  registry.  Calculations  were  done  for  the  three
communities separately. The 95 percent confidence interval for each prevalence was
calculated  based  on  the  Poisson  distribution.  In  order  to  determine  if  there  was  a
statistically  significant  elevation  in  the  occurrence  of  birth  defects,  the  prevalence
rates  for  the  areas  and  time  period  of  interest  were  compared  to  the  prevalence
rates for all of Texas during January 1999 through December 2001. Prevalence rates
were considered statistically significantly different if their 95 percent confidence in-
tervals did not overlap.
Adjusted Prevalence: The occurrence of many types of birth defects is known to vary
between  mothers  of  different  age  groups,  mothers  of  different  racial/ethnic  groups,
and between male and female infants. For each type of birth defect that was statis-
tically  significantly  elevated  based  on  the  unadjusted  prevalence,  we  calculated
prevalence rates adjusted separately for age, race/ethnicity, and sex. Adjustment ac-
counts for any differences in the age, racial/ethnic, or sex composition of populations
being compared, in this case, differences between the communities of interest during
1997–2001 and all of Texas during 1999–2001.

Using  the  direct  method  of  standardization,  maternal  age-specific  rates  for  the
area of interest were standardized (adjusted) to the maternal age distribution of all
Texas  resident  live  births  during  1999–2001.  The  resulting  adjusted  rate  is  the  hy-
pothetical  rate  that  would  have  been  observed  in  the  area  of  interest  if  that  area

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00158 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

151

had  the  same  maternal  age  distribution  as  Texas  overall  in  1999–2001.  Similarly,
maternal racial/ethnic-specific rates for the area of interest were standardized to the
maternal  race/ethnic  distribution  of  Texas  resident  live  births  during  1999–2001,
yielding the hypothetical rate that would have been observed if the area of interest
had the same maternal race/ethnic distribution as Texas. Finally, adjustment for in-
fant sex was accomplished in the same manner.

The  DIRST  module  of  Computer  Programs  for  Epidemiologists,1 version  4.0,  was
used  to  calculate  directly  standardized  rates  and  their  associated  95  percent  con-
fidence intervals.
Age-, Race-, and Sex-specific Prevalence: For the types of birth defects that were sta-
tistically  significantly  elevated  based  on  the  unadjusted  prevalence  and  that  re-
mained statistically significant after adjustment, we have shown prevalence by ma-
ternal age group, maternal racial/ethnic group, and infant sex, plus 95 percent con-
fidence intervals based on the Poisson distribution.
Estimated Date of Conception: The estimated date of conception was calculated and
graphed  for  cases  having  the  types  of  birth  defects  that  remained  statistically  sig-
nificantly  elevated  after  adjustment.  If  the  last  menstrual  period  (LMP)  date  was
available, the estimated date of conception was calculated as the LMP date plus 14
days.  If  LMP  date  was  not  available,  the  estimated  date  of  conception  was  cal-
culated as the expected date of delivery minus 266 days.
Spot Map: For the types of birth defects that remained statistically significant after
adjustment, a spot map was made using the mother’s residence address at the time
of delivery, as reported on the child’s birth or fetal death certificate. The map is not
included in this report to protect the privacy of the families.

RESULTS
Unadjusted Prevalence: We examined the occurrence of 48 types of birth defects and
any  birth  defect  monitored  by  the  registry  among  deliveries  during  January  1997
through  December  2001  to  residents  of  Midlothian,  Venus,  and  Cedar  Hill  sepa-
rately.

For  Venus  and  for  Cedar  Hill  during  1997–2001,  none  of  the  birth  defects  exam-
ined  was  statistically  significantly  higher  than  the  statewide  prevalence  in  1999–
2001. The prevalence of any monitored birth defect also was not statistically signifi-
cantly elevated in Venus or Cedar Hill, compared to the entire state.

For Midlothian during 1997–2001, two categories of birth defects were statistically

significantly higher than the statewide prevalence in 1999–2001.

The  unadjusted  prevalence  of  hypospadias  or  epispadias  among  Midlothian  resi-
dent  deliveries  during  1997–2001  was  102.39  cases  per  10,000  live  births  (95  per-
cent confidence interval 52.91–178.85) (Table 1), which was 3.5 times the prevalence
for  Texas  in  1999–2001  (28.87  cases  per  10,000  live  births,  95  percent  CI  27.86–
29.88) and statistically significant.

The  unadjusted  prevalence  of  any  monitored  birth  defect  among  Midlothian  resi-
dent  deliveries  during  1997–2001  was  511.95  cases  per  10,000  live  births  (95  per-
cent  CI  390.61–658.96)  (Table  2).  This  was  1.5  times  the  prevalence  for  Texas  in
1999–2001  (350.12  cases  per  10,000  live  births,  95  percent  CI  346.59–353.65)  and
statistically significant.
Adjusted  Prevalence:  Adjusted  prevalences  were  calculated  for  hypospadias  or
epispadias and for any monitored birth defect among Midlothian resident deliveries
during 1997–2001.

For  hypospadias  or  epispadias  (Table  1),  adjusting  for  infant  sex  had  no  impact
on the prevalence, yielding a sex-adjusted prevalence of 102.75 cases per 10,000 live
births,  which  was  essentially  unchanged  from  the  unadjusted  prevalence  of  102.39
cases per 10,000 live births. Adjusting for maternal age group caused the prevalence
of  hypospadias  or  epispadias  to  increase  very  slightly,  from  102.39  unadjusted  to
106.02  after  adjustment.  Adjusting  for  maternal  race/ethnicity  caused  the  preva-
lence  of  hypospadias/epispadias  to  increase  from  102.39  unadjusted  to  119.86  after
adjustment.

This  means  that  the  elevation  observed  in  Midlothian  during  1997–2001  for
hypospadias  or  epispadias  cannot  be  attributed  to  differences  between  Midlothian
and Texas overall in the proportion of boys and girls being born, or in the race/eth-
nic or age distribution of women having children. The prevalence of hypospadias or

epispadias  remained  statistically  significantly  elevated  in  Midlothian  after  adjust-
ment for sex, maternal age, and maternal race/ethnicity.

152

For  any  monitored  birth  defect  (Table  2),  adjusting  for  sex  had  no  impact  on  the
prevalence.  The  sex-adjusted  prevalence,  512.58  cases  per  10,000  live  births,  was
nearly  the  same  as  the  unadjusted  prevalence,  511.95.  Likewise,  adjusting  for  ma-
ternal  age  group  had  no  impact  on  the  prevalence  of  any  monitored  defect  (511.95
unadjusted compared to 513.71 after adjustment).

Adjusting  for  maternal  race/ethnicity  caused  the  prevalence  of  any  monitored
birth  defect  to  decrease  from  511.95  per  10,000  unadjusted  to  402.69  adjusted  (95
percent CI 256.37–549.01) (Table 2). Further, the adjusted prevalence was no longer
statistically  significantly  elevated  compared  to  Texas  in  1999–2001  (350.12;  95  per-
cent CI 346.59–353.65).

This  means  that  the  elevation  observed  in  Midlothian  during  1997–2001  for  any
monitored  birth  defect  can  be  explained  by  differences  between  Midlothian  and
Texas  overall  in  the  race/ethnic  distribution  of  women  having  children.  In
Midlothian, 83.2 percent of mothers who gave birth in 1997–2001 were non-Hispanic
White  women,  while  in  Texas  during  1999-2001,  only  39.2  percent  of  births  were
to  non-Hispanic  White  mothers.  Further,  in  Texas  overall  during  1999–2001,  the
prevalence of any monitored birth defect was statistically significantly higher among
non-Hispanic  White  mothers  (374.16  per  10,000  live  births;  95  percent  CI  368.33–
380.00)  than  among  African  American  mothers  (339.69;  95  percent  CI  329.34–
350.04)  or  Hispanic  mothers  (340.34;  95  percent  CI  335.21–345.48).  Because  most
Midlothian  mothers  are  non-Hispanic  White  women,  and  because  the  prevalence  of
any  monitored  birth  defect  is  higher  among  mothers  of  this  race/ethnic  group,  the
unadjusted prevalence of any monitored birth defect in Midlothian was higher than
the Texas prevalence, and it decreased after adjustment for race/ethnicity.

Age-,  Race-,  and  Sex-specific  Prevalence:  Since  hypospadias  or  epispadias  was  the
only  type  of  birth  defect  that  was  statistically  significantly  elevated  after  adjust-
ment,  we  took  a  closer  look  at  it.  Table  3  shows  the  prevalence  of  hypospadias  or
epispadias  by  maternal  age  group,  maternal  race/ethnicity,  and  infant  sex  among
Midlothian  resident  deliveries  during  1997–2001.  Data  for  Texas  in  1999–2001  are
also presented for comparison.

The mothers of Midlothian children with hypospadias or epispadias ranged in age
from  17  to  37.  The  prevalence  of  hypospadias  or  epispadias  among  mothers  less
than 20 years old was statistically significantly higher in Midlothian than in Texas.
For all other maternal age groups, the Midlothian prevalences did not attain statis-
tical significance.

Midlothian mothers of ‘Other’ race/ethnicity were significantly more likely to have
a  child  with  hypospadias  or  epispadias  than  mothers  of  ‘Other’  race/ethnicity  state-
wide. This was the only racial/ethnic group that was statistically significantly high-
er than the state.

Estimated  Dates  of  Conception:  The  12  Midlothian  children  born  during  1997–2001
with  hypospadias  or  epispadias  were  estimated  to  have  been  conceived  from  Sep-
tember 1996 through April 2000. No more than one case was conceived in any given
month  during  this  time  period,  nor  was  there  any  other  evidence  of  clustering  in
time (Figure 1).

Spot  map:  The  spot  map  of  maternal  residence  address  at  time  of  delivery  for  the
12  Midlothian  children  born  during  1997–2001  with  hypospadias  or  epispadias  did
not  show  any  strong  evidence  of  geographic  clustering  within  Midlothian.  Seven  of
the  residences  were  distributed  within  the  current  Midlothian  city  limits  and  five
were  outside  the  city  limits.  The  map  is  not  included  in  this  report  to  protect  the
privacy of the families.

DISCUSSION

Using  data  in  the  Texas  Birth  Defects  Registry,  we  examined  the  occurrence  of
48  specific  birth  defects  and  any  defect  monitored  by  the  registry  among  deliveries
during  1997–2001  to  residents  of  Midlothian,  Venus,  and  Cedar  Hill,  Texas.  None
of  the  birth  defects  examined  were  statistically  significantly  elevated  in  Venus  or
Cedar Hill. Any monitored birth defect and hypospadias or epispadias were elevated
in Midlothian during 1997–2001.

The  prevalence  of  any  monitored  defect  in  Midlothian  decreased  and  was  no
longer statistically significantly elevated after adjusting for maternal race/ethnicity.
This indicates that the elevation observed in Midlothian for any monitored birth de-
fect  can  be  attributed  to  differences  between  Midlothian  and  Texas  in  the  race/eth-
nic  distribution  of  women  having  children.  If  Midlothian  had  the  same  maternal
race/ethnic  distribution  as  Texas,  the  prevalence  of  any  monitored  birth  defect  in
Midlothian would have been within the range of what is expected.

Hypospadias  or  epispadias  remained  statistically  significantly  elevated 

in
Midlothian  after  adjustment  for  sex,  race/ethnicity,  and  age,  meaning  that  this  ele-
vation  cannot  be  explained  by  differences  between  Midlothian  and  the  state  in  the
proportion  of  boys  and  girls  being  born,  or  in  the  race/ethnic  or  age  distribution  of
women having children.

Hypospadias  is  a  congenital  defect  in  which  the  urinary  meatus  (urinary  outlet)
is  on  the  underside  of  the  penis  or  on  the  perineum  (the  area  between  the  genitals
and the anus). In epispadias, the urinary meatus opens above (dorsal to) the normal
position. The corresponding defects in females are very rare.

All of the 12 Midlothian children had hypospadias, rather than epispadias.
A  spot  map  did  not  indicate  geographic  clustering  within  Midlothian  of  the  resi-
dences  of  the  mothers  of  children  with  hypospadias,  and  a  graph  of  estimated  con-
ception dates did not indicate clustering in time of conception.

We made 147 comparisons of community level birth defects data to statewide data
(48  birth  defects  plus  any  monitored  defect,  times  three  communities).  At  the  95
percent  level  of  significance,  we  would  expect  five  percent  of  the  147  comparisons,
or seven comparisons, to have been statistically significant due to chance. We found
two  that  were  statistically  significant,  and  one  that  remained  significant  after  ad-
justment for sex, maternal race/ethnicity, and maternal age.

Although hypospadias/epispadias was elevated in Midlothian, it does not meet cri-
teria  to  continue  this  investigation  and  thus  further  study  at  this  time  is  unlikely
to  yield  useful  results.  To  continue,  our  protocol  requires  at  least  three  cases  with
a  documented  biologically  plausible  exposure  that  the  cases  have  in  common,  or  at
least five cases with an observed rate of more than 10 times the expected rate. How-
ever,  because  of  the  elevation,  the  Texas  Birth  Defects  Registry  will  continue  to
monitor hypospadias. As more years of data become available in the future, we will
re-examine the prevalence of hypospadias in the area.

CONCLUSIONS

Hypospadias  or  epispadias  was  elevated  among  Midlothian  resident  deliveries
during  1997–2001.  We  will  re-examine  the  occurrence  of  hypospadias  or  epispadias
after  subsequent  delivery  years  are  completed  in  the  Texas  Birth  Defects  Registry.

Summary of Investigation into the Occurrence of Cancer

Zip Codes 76065, 75104, and 76084,
Midlothian, Cedar Hill, and Venus

Ellis, Dallas, and Johnson County, Texas

1993–2002

MAY 19, 2005

Background:

Concern  about  a  possible  excess  of  cancer  prompted  the  Texas  Cancer  Registry
(TCR) Branch of the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) to examine
the  occurrence  of  cancer  in  zip  codes  76065,  75104,  76084,  Midlothian,  Cedar  Hill,
and Venus, Texas. Local residents were concerned that benzene, 1, 3 butadiene, and
radiation  from  the  nearby  cement  plants  may  be  causing  cancer  among  residents.
Laryngeal  cancer  has  been  associated  with  workers  exposed  to  cement  dust.  Ben-
zene  has  shown  an  association  with  acute  myeloid  leukemia  and  non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma  in  the  scientific  literature,  while  radiation  has  been  weakly  linked  with
several leukemia subtypes, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and brain cancer. Exposure to
1,  3  butadiene  has  been  associated  with  leukemia.  The  TCR  evaluated  1995–2002
incidence data and 1993–2002 mortality data for cancers of the female breast, pros-
tate,  lung  and  bronchus,  colon  and  rectum,  male  bladder,  corpus  and  uterus,  non-
Hodgkin’s  lymphoma,  brain/CNS,  larynx,  selected  leukemia  subtypes,  and  total
childhood  cancers.  Incidence  data  are  the  best  indicator  of  the  occurrence  of  cancer
in an area because they show how many cancers were diagnosed each year. Cancer
mortality data are used as a supplemental measure and are complete for the entire
state  through  2002.  The  rest  of  this  report  examines  the  investigative  methods  the
TCR  used,  the  results  of  the  investigation,  recommendations,  and  general  informa-
tion on cancer risk factors.

Methodology:

According to the National Cancer Institute, a cancer cluster is a greater than ex-
pected number of cancers among people who live or work in the same area and who
develop  or  die  from  the  same  cancer  within  a  short  time  of  each  other.  The  cancer
cluster  investigation  is  the  primary  tool  used  by  the  TCR  to  investigate  the  possi-
bility  of  excess  cancer  in  a  community.  The  cancer  cluster  investigation  cannot  de-
termine  that  cancer  was  associated  with  or  caused  by  environmental  or  other  risk
factors.  Instead,  the  cancer  cluster  investigation  is  specifically  intended  to  address
the question ‘‘Is there an excess of cancer in the area or population of concern?’’

The TCR follows guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention  for  investigating  cancer  clusters1 and  often  works  with  the  DSHS  Envi-
ronmental  and  Injury  Epidemiology  and  Toxicology  Branch,  as  well  as  other  state
and  federal  agencies.  In  order  to  determine  if  an  excess  of  cancer  is  occurring  and
if further study is recommended, biologic and epidemiologic evidence are considered.
Such  evidence  may  include  documented  exposures;  the  toxicity  of  the  exposures;
plausible  routes  by  which  exposures  can  reach  people  (ingesting,  touching,  breath-
ing);  the  actual  amount  of  exposure  to  the  people  which  can  lead  to  absorption  in
the  body;  the  time  from  exposure  to  development  of  cancer;  the  statistical  signifi-
cance of the findings; the magnitude of the effect observed; risk factors; and the con-
sistency of the findings over time. The occurrence of rare cancers or unlikely cancers
in certain age groups may also indicate a cluster needing further study. Because ex-
cesses  of  cancer  may  occur  by  chance  alone,  the  role  of  chance  is  considered  in  the
statistical analysis.

If further study is indicated, the TCR will determine the feasibility of conducting
further  epidemiologic  study.  If  the  epidemiologic  study  is  feasible,  the  final  step  is
to  recommend  and/or  perform  an  etiologic  investigation  to  see  if  the  cancer(s)  can
be  related  to  an  exposure.  Very  few  cancer  cluster  investigations  in  the  United
States proceed to this stage.

To determine whether a statistically significant excess of cancer existed in the ge-
ographic  areas  of  concern,  the  number  of  observed  cases  and  deaths  was  compared

to  what  would  be  ‘‘expected’’  based  on  the  state  cancer  rates.  Calculating  the  ex-
pected number(s) of cancer cases takes into consideration the race, sex, and ages of
people  who  are  diagnosed  or  die  from  cancer.  This  is  important  because  peoples’
race,  sex,  and  age  all  impact  cancer  rates.  If  we  are  trying  to  determine  if  there
is  more  or  less  cancer  in  a  community  compared  to  the  rest  of  the  state,  we  must
make  sure  that  the  difference  in  cancer  rates  is  not  simply  due  to  one  of  these  fac-
tors.

The  attached  Tables  1–6  present  the  number  of  observed  cases  and  deaths  for
males and females, the number of ‘‘expected’’ cases and deaths, the standardized in-
cidence ratio (SIR) or standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and the corresponding 99
percent  confidence  interval.  The  standardized  incidence  or  mortality  ratio  (SIR,
SMR)  is  simply  the  number  of  observed  cases  or  deaths  compared  to  the  number
of  ‘‘expected’’  cases  or  deaths.  When  the  SIR  or  SMR  of  a  selected  cancer  is  equal
to 1.00, then the number of observed cases or deaths is equal to the expected num-
ber  of  cases  or  deaths,  based  on  the  incidence  or  mortality  in  the  rest  of  the  state.
When  the  SIR  or  SMR  is  less  than  1.00,  fewer  people  developed  or  died  of  cancer
than  we  would  have  expected.  Conversely,  an  SIR  or  SMR  greater  than  1.00  indi-
cates  that  more  people  developed  or  died  of  cancer  than  we  would  have  expected.
To  determine  if  an  SIR  or  SMR  greater  than  1.00  or  less  than  1.00  is  statistically
significant  or  outside  the  variation  likely  to  be  due  to  chance,  confidence  intervals
are also calculated.

A  99  percent  confidence  interval  is  used  for  statistical  significance  and  takes  the
likelihood  that  the  result  occurred  by  chance  into  account.  It  also  indicates  the
range  in  which  we  would  expect  the  SIR  or  SMR  to  fall  99  percent  of  the  time.  If
the  confidence  interval  contains  a  range  that  includes  1.00,  no  statistically  signifi-
cant  excess  of  cancer  is  indicated.  The  confidence  intervals  are  particularly  impor-
tant  when  trying  to  interpret  small  numbers  of  cases.  If  only  one  or  two  cases  are
expected for a particular cancer, then the report of three or four observed cases will
result  in  a  very  large  SIR  or  SMR.  As  long  as  the  99  percent  confidence  interval
contains 1.00, this indicates that the SIR or SMR is still within the range one might
expect and, therefore, not statistically significant.

Results:

The analysis of incidence data for zip codes 76065, 75104, and 76084, Midlothian,
Cedar  Hill,  and  Venus,  Texas,  from  January  1,  1995–December  31,  2002,  and  mor-
tality  data  from  January  1,  1993–December  31,  2002,  found  cancers  of  the  breast,
lung and bronchus, corpus and uterus, brain/CNS, bladder, colorectal, non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma,  selected  leukemia  subtypes,  and  total  childhood  cancers  (0–19)  to  be
within normal ranges in both males and females. Prostate cancer mortality was sta-
tistically  significantly  lower  than  expected  in  zip  code  76065  males  while  prostate
cancer incidence was statistically significantly lower than expected in zip code 76084
males. Analysis summaries are presented in Tables 1–6.

Discussion:

Like  other  studies,  this  cancer  cluster  investigation  had  limitations.  The  number
of  years  of  incidence  data  examined  was  limited  to  eight  years  and  did  not  include
data for the most recent years. Ten years of mortality data were examined as a sup-
plemental  measure.  Also,  cancer  incidence  data  are  based  on  residence  at  the  time
of diagnosis and mortality data the residence at the time of death. It is possible that
some  residents  who  may  have  been  exposed  and  developed  cancer  no  longer  lived
in the area at the time of diagnosis or death, so were not included in the analyses.
However, it is also possible that people may have moved into the area and then de-
veloped or died from cancer because of an exposure from a prior residential location
or other factors. These cases and deaths are included in the investigation.

Recommendations:

Based on the findings and the information discussed above, it is not recommended
at  this  time  to  further  examine  the  cancers  in  zip  codes  76065,  75104,  76084,
Midlothian,  Cedar  Hill,  and  Venus,  Texas.  As  new  data  or  additional  information
become available, consideration will be given to updating or re-evaluating this inves-
tigation.

Information on Cancer and Cancer Risk Factors:

Overall, the occurrence of cancer is common, with approximately two out of every
five  persons  alive  today  predicted  to  develop  some  type  of  cancer  in  their  lifetime.2
In  Texas,  as  in  the  United  States,  cancer  is  the  second  leading  cause  of  death,  ex-
ceeded only by heart disease. Also, cancer is not one disease, but many different dis-
eases.  Different  types  of  cancer  are  generally  thought  to  have  different  causes.  If
a  person  develops  cancer,  it  is  probably  not  due  to  one  factor  but  to  a  combination
of  factors  such  as  heredity;  diet,  tobacco  use,  and  other  lifestyle  factors;  infectious
agents;  chemical  exposures;  and  radiation  exposures.  Although  cancer  may  impact
individuals  of  all  ages,  it  primarily  is  a  disease  of  older  persons  with  over  one-half
of  cancer  cases  and  two-thirds  of  cancer  deaths  occurring  in  persons  65  and  older.
Finally,  it  takes  time  for  cancer  to  develop,  more  than  10  years  can  go  by  between
the exposure to a carcinogen and a diagnosis of cancer.3

The  chances  of  a  person  developing  cancer  as  a  result  of  exposure  to  an  environ-
mental contaminant are slight. Most experts agree that exposure to pollution, occu-
pational, and industrial hazards account for fewer than 10 percent of cancer cases.4
According  to  Richard  Doll  and  Richard  Peto,  renowned  epidemiologists  at  the  Uni-
versity of Oxford, pollution and occupational exposures are estimated to collectively
cause four to six percent of all cancer deaths.5 The Harvard Center for Cancer Pre-
vention  estimates  five  percent  of  cancer  deaths  are  due  to  occupational  factors,  two
percent  to  environmental  pollution  and  two  percent  to  ionizing/ultraviolet  radi-
ation.6 Additionally  much  of  the  evidence  that  pollutants  and  pesticide  residues  in-
crease  cancer  risk  is  presently  considered  quite  weak  and  inconsistent.  In  contrast,
the  National  Cancer  Institute  estimates  that  lifestyle  factors  such  as  tobacco  use
and diet cause 50 to 75 percent of cancer deaths.7 Eating a healthy diet and refrain-
ing  from  tobacco  are  the  best  ways  to  prevent  many  kinds  of  cancer.  One-third  of
all  cancer  deaths  in  this  country  could  be  prevented  by  eliminating  the  use  of  to-
bacco  products.  Additionally,  about  25  to  30  percent  of  the  cases  of  several  major
cancers are associated with obesity and physical inactivity.8

Known Risk Factors for Cancers Examined in This Investigation:

The following is a brief discussion summarized from the American Cancer Society
and  the  National  Cancer  Institute  about  cancer  risk  factors  for  the  specific  cancers
studied in this investigation.9,10

The  occurrence  of  cancer  may  vary  by  race/ethnicity,  gender,  type  of  cancer,  geo-
graphic  location,  population  group,  and  a  variety  of  other  factors.  Scientific  studies
have identified a number of factors for various cancers that may increase an individ-
ual’s  risk  of  developing  a  specific  type  of  cancer.  These  factors  are  known  as  risk
factors. Some risk factors we can do nothing about, but many are a matter of choice.

Prostate Cancer

Prostate  cancer  is  the  most  common  type  of  malignant  cancer  (other  than  skin)
diagnosed in men, affecting an estimated one in five American men. Risk factors for
prostate  cancer  include  aging,  a  high  fat  diet,  physical  inactivity,  and  a  family  his-
tory  of  prostate  cancer.  African  American  men  are  at  higher  risk  of  acquiring  pros-
tate  cancer  and  dying  from  it.  Prostate  cancer  is  most  common  in  North  America
and  northwestern  Europe.  It  is  less  common  in  Asia,  Africa,  Central  America,  and
South America.

Breast Cancer

Simply being a woman is the main risk factor for developing breast cancer. Breast
cancer  can  affect  men,  but  this  disease  is  about  100  times  more  common  among
women  than  men.  White  women  are  slightly  more  likely  to  develop  breast  cancer
than  are  African-American  women,  but  African  Americans  are  more  likely  to  die  of
this cancer because they are often diagnosed at an advanced stage when breast can-
cer  is  harder  to  treat  and  cure.  Other  risk  factors  for  breast  cancer  include  aging,
presence  of  genetic  markers  such  as  the  BRCA1  and  BRCA2  genes,  personal  and
family history of breast cancer, previous breast biopsies, previous breast irradiation,
diethylstilbestrol  therapy,  oral  contraceptive  use,  not  having  children,  hormone  re-
placement  therapy,  alcohol,  and  obesity.  Currently,  research  does  not  show  a  link
between breast cancer risk and environmental pollutants such as the pesticide DDE
(chemically related to DDT) and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls).

Lung and Bronchus Cancer

The  greatest  single  risk  factor  for  lung  cancer  is  smoking.  The  American  Caner
Society  estimates  that  87  percent  of  lung  cancer  is  due  to  smoking.  Several  studies
have  shown  that  the  lung  cells  of  women  have  a  genetic  predisposition  to  develop
cancer  when  they  are  exposed  to  tobacco  smoke.  Other  risk  factors  include  second-
hand  smoke,  asbestos  exposure,  radon  exposure,  carcinogenic  agents  in  the  work-
place  such  as  arsenic  or  vinyl  chloride,  marijuana  smoking,  recurring  inflammation
of  the  lungs,  exposure  to  industrial  grade  talc,  people  with  silicosis  and  berylliosis,
personal and family history of lung cancer, diet, and air pollution.

Brain/CNS Cancer

The large majority of brain cancers are not associated with any risk factors. Most
brain  cancers  simply  happen  for  no  apparent  reason.  A  few  risk  factors  associated
with brain cancer are known and include radiation treatment, occupational exposure
to  vinyl  chloride,  immune  system  disorders,  and  family  history  of  brain  and  spinal
cord  cancers.  Possible  risk  factors  include  exposure  to  aspartame  (a  sugar  sub-
stitute) and exposure to electromagnetic fields from cellular telephones or high-ten-
sion wires.

Bladder Cancer

The  greatest  risk  factor  for  bladder  cancer  is  smoking.  Smokers  are  more  than
twice as likely to get bladder cancer as nonsmokers. Whites are two times more like-
ly to develop bladder cancer than are African Americans. Other risk factors for blad-
der cancer include occupational exposure to aromatic amines such as benzidine and
beta-napthylamine,  aging,  chronic  bladder 
inflammation,  personal  history  of
urothelial carcinomas, birth defects involving the bladder and umbilicus, high doses
of certain chemotherapy drugs, and use of the herb Aristocholia Fangchi.

Colon and Rectum Cancer

Colorectal  cancer  is  the  second  leading  cause  of  cancer  death  in  both  men  and
women.  Researchers  have  identified  several  risk  factors  that  increase  a  person’s
chance of developing colorectal cancer: family and personal history of colorectal can-
cer,  hereditary  conditions  such  as  familial  adenomatous  polyposis,  personal  history
of  intestinal  polyps  and  chronic  inflammatory  bowel  disease,  aging,  a  diet  mostly
from animal sources, physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and heavy use of alcohol.
People  with  diabetes  have  a  30  percent–40  percent  increased  chance  of  developing
colon cancer. Recent research has found a genetic mutation leading to colorectal can-
cer in Jews of Eastern European descent (Ashkenazi Jews).

Laryngeal Cancer

Risk  factors  for  laryngeal  and  hypopharynx  cancer  include  tobacco  use,  alcohol
abuse,  poor  nutrition,  infection  with  human  papillomavirus,  a  weakened  immune
system,  and  occupational  exposure.  Men  who  are  aging  and  African  Americans  are
more likely to be diagnosed with this cancer.

Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia

Possible risk factors for ALL include the following: being male, being white, being
older than 70 years of age, past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy,
exposure  to  atomic  bomb  radiation,  or  having  a  certain  genetic  disorder  such  as
Down syndrome.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

Possible  risk  factors  for  CLL  include  the  following:  being  middle-aged  or  older,
male,  or  white;  a  family  history  of  CLL  or  cancer  of  the  lymph  system;  having  rel-
atives who are Russian Jews or Eastern European Jews; or having exposure to her-
bicides  or  insecticides  including  Agent  Orange,  an  herbicide  used  during  the  Viet-
nam War.

Acute Myeloid Leukemia

Possible  risk  factors  for  AML  include  the  following:  being  male;  smoking,  espe-
cially  after  age  60;  having  had  treatment  with  chemotherapy  or  radiation  therapy
in the past; having treatment for childhood ALL in the past; being exposed to atomic
bomb radiation or the chemical benzene; or having a history of a blood disorder such
as myelodysplastic syndrome.

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia

Most  people  with  CML  have  a  gene  mutation  (change)  called  the  Philadelphia

chromosome. The Philadelphia chromosome is not passed from parent to child.

Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma

Risk  factors  for  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  include  infection  with  Helicobacter
pylori,  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV),  human  T-cell  leukemia/lymphoma
virus  (HTVL–1),  or  the  Epstein-Barr  virus  and  malaria.  Other  possible  risk  factors
include  certain  genetic  diseases,  radiation  exposure,  immuno-suppressant  drugs
after  organ  transplantation,  benzene  exposure,  the  drug  Dilantin,  exposure  to  cer-
tain pesticides, a diet high in meats or fat, or certain chemotherapy drugs.

BIOGRAPHY FOR SALVADOR MIER
Sal Mier lives in Midlothian, Texas with his wife Grace.
Sal’s 37-year career in public health started with the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) in New Orleans, shortly after he graduated from the University of New Mex-
ico.  This  career  took  him  to  Puerto  Rico,  Arkansas  and  New  Mexico  where  he  had
a temporary assignment to the Navajo Nation.

Sal worked for an interim period with the U.S. Public Health Service, Health Re-
sources  and  Services  Administration,  for  a  short  period.  He  returned  to  work  with
CDC  where  he  ended  his  federal  career  as  Director,  Division  of  Prevention  Region
VI, in Dallas, Texas.

After  retiring  from  CDC,  Sal  was  a  private  public  health  consultant  with  a  focus

on U.S./Mexico Public Health issues, HIV and STDs.

Sal  and  his  wife  Grace  have  worked  tirelessly  these  last  five  years  trying  to  get
answers from what he refers to as ‘‘our guardian agencies’’ about health issues that
are surfacing in the community. ‘‘Our only motivation is the health of our children,
our grandchildren and those yet to be born,’’ he explains.

Chair MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Mier.
Professor Parrish.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  RANDALL  R.  PARRISH,  HEAD,  NATURAL
ENVIRONMENTAL  RESEARCH  COUNCIL  (NERC)  ISOTOPE
GEOSCIENCES LABORATORY, BRITISH GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
Dr.  PARRISH.  It  is  a  privilege  to  be  here  and  I  thank  you  for  the
opportunity. It is an interesting contrast to my day job as research
professor  at  University  of  Leicester  and  I  run  a  large  environ-
mental  isotope  analysis  facility  in  the  U.K.  My  role  here  today  is
really just to provide you with my perspective on the Colonie, New
York, that is a suburb of Albany, New York, health consultation as
a  result  of  my  conducting  research  there  on  depleted  uranium  pol-
lution at the site as part of a broader investigation of depleted ura-
nium and health issues.

What I want to do is really just emphasize some of the most rel-
evant  and  compelling  facts  and  issues  about  the  health  consulta-
tion. As illustrated on the side panels, depleted uranium munitions
and other uranium manufactured items were made at the National
Lead  Industries  plant  in  Colonie,  New  York,  from  1958  to  1984
when  the  plant  was  closed  due  to  the  company’s  environmental
negligence  from  release  of  excessive  radioactive  uranium  oxide
aerosols on the surrounding community, and the community can be
seen to surround the remediated plant. In about the mid-1980s the
Federal  Government  accepted  responsibility  for  this  site  and  up  to
2006 has spent approximately $200 million remediating the site. In
response  to  the  community  concerns  expressed  to  the  Army  Corps
of  Engineers,  the  ATSDR  concluded  a  health  consultation  in  2004
and  its  fundamental  conclusion  was  that  in  the  active  years  of
emissions,  these  emissions  endangered  the  local  population  and
workers’  health  by  the  risk  of  inhalation  exposure  to  uranium
oxide. On this conclusion, there is general broad agreement.

With  regards  to  the  health  consultation  that  ATSDR  did  at  the
site, let me just mention a few specific outcomes. You will recognize
some  themes  here  that  are  common  to  other  health  consultations.
The Agency decided not to conduct any new research as part of its
health  consultation  and  did  not  pursue  any  further  environmental
investigations or health surveillance activities. It misunderstood or
was unaware of the analytical tools available at the time to identify
the  presence  of  depleted  uranium  in  urine  bioassays  via  isotope

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00174 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

analysis. It concluded that the 20-year length of time from the 1984
closure  would  make  identification  of  any  DU  exposure,  DU  mean-
ing  depleted  uranium,  impossible.  It  also  concluded  that  it  simply
wasn’t  feasible  or  possible  to  identify  the  cohort  of  workers  and
residents with the highest exposure. It gave also incomplete and in
part  unbalanced  descriptions  of  the  relative  health  importance  of
the  two  exposure  pathways,  one  being  the  relatively  benign  inges-
tion  pathway,  that  is,  coming  into  contact  with  contaminated  soil,
and  the  other  being  the  more  insidious  inhalation  pathway  which
has higher health risks associated with it. In short, the Agency ap-
peared  to  dismiss  the  viability  of  conducting  any  further  health
studies on the exposed population.

Now, the difference in the Colonie situation with respect to some
other  sites  where  health  consultations  have  taken  place  and  prob-
ably  the  reason  I  am  here  is  that  our  research  group  has,  so  to
speak,  sort  of  picked  up  the  pieces  of  the  situation  following  the
health  consultation  and  we  have  conducted  some  of  the  work  that
ATSDR  could  and  should  have  done.  For  example,  we  determined
the  chemical  form  for  some  of  the  particulates  and  showed  that  it
was  the  least  soluble  of  all  forms  of  uranium  oxide.  We  also  used
a high-sensitivity method for uranium isotope urine testing that we
had previously developed in the U.K., and we showed that depleted
uranium could be identified in the urine of exposed individuals and
it  can  be  quantified,  even  more  than  20  years  after  these  people
were  exposed.  We  extended  substantially  the  existing  1980s  vin-
tage environmental surveys and we worked in a collaborative fash-
ion with the community to identify a portion of the historically ex-
posed  cohort.  In  short,  we  in  part  accomplished  what  ATSDR  said
was  not  possible  and  we  did  this  with  very  modest  resources  and
actually at no expense to the U.S. taxpayer. This brings this whole
issue into even sharper focus about the shortcomings of the health
consultation.

Sort of taking a step back, there is a larger perspective about de-
pleted  uranium  and  health  issues  that  relates  to  broader  issues
such  as  Gulf  War  illness  that  affects  veterans  and  the  continued
use  of  depleted  uranium  munitions  by  the  U.S.  military.  ATSDR
did  not  appear  to  recognize  an  opportunity  at  Colonie  to  shed  fur-
ther  light  on  these  broader  issues,  the  opportunity  being  to  study
long-term  health  consequences,  if  any,  of  exposure  to  inhaled  de-
pleted  uranium  oxides.  The  exposure  to  DU  has  been  an  ongoing
issue in the media and government with respect to exposure of sol-
diers  to  this  toxin  and  its  health  consequences,  and  the  issue  does
not  have  sufficient  study  at  present.  A  comprehensive  study  could
have  added  new  knowledge  to  help  resolve  this  issue  and  it  is
therefore part of the government’s duty of care to soldiers and vet-
erans who have unselfishly served the Nation.

Considering  the  acknowledged  risks  to  health  at  Colonie  that
arose partly that were obvious in the first place but also confirmed
by the health consultation, the lack of any resources devoted to tar-
geted health studies at Colonie when compared to the $200 million
spent  on  remediation  is,  if  one  is  being  generous,  grossly  imbal-
anced,  and  if  you  are  shedding  it  in  the  worst  light,  you  could  say
that this is somewhat immoral and perverse.

168

Let me just conclude with a few general comments about ATSDR
and  perhaps  the  way  forward.  The  ATSDR  remit  sets  quite  a  high
bar  to  reach,  that  is,  basically  effectively  protecting  the  health  of
the  Nation.  This  is  a  complicated  and  potentially  very  expensive
challenge.  The  pattern  of  performance  in  recent  years  as  I  have
gathered simply from reading documents in the past few weeks and
learning  more  about  this  committee  appears  to  suggest  that  this
standard is not being achieved. So it seems to me there are two op-
tions.  One  is  that  we  partly  admit  that  some  of  this  high  bar,  this
high standard of performance may be unachievable, in which case,
you know, it should be redefined so that ATSDR can actually have
realistic goals.

Alternatively, if the remit of ATSDR is a valid, you know, public
service imperative, then it seems to me you have to do three things
and they have to be coordinated and done effectively together. The
first  is  that  the  Agency  has  got  to  have  a  strong  vision,  it  has  to
have  strong  leadership  and  especially  needs  commitment  through-
out  the  organization  to  its  mission  and  it  has  to  basically  embrace
that  ethos.  The  second  point  is  that  the  Agency  needs  to  have  the
resources to pursue its investigations to their logical and defensible
conclusions  and  be  able  to  resist  interference.  Both  of  these  two
recommendations, it seems to me, are essential to restore the credi-
bility  of  the  Agency.  The  third  thing  that  needs  to  be  done  in  con-
cert  with  the  rest  is  that  the  Agency  needs  to  find  and  implement
a  mechanism  that  effectively  and  defensibly  prioritizes  its  inves-
tigations  and  resources  so  that  it  actually  can  deliver  its  remit.
This  external  review  prior  to  release  of  documents  could  form  a
component of that. This third one basically would allow the Agency
to  maintain  credibility  once  it  establishes  a  renewed  sort  of  pres-
ence for the future.

So that is the end of my statement. I will be glad to answer ques-

tions later on. Thank you.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Parrish follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RANDALL R. PARRISH

Summary

National  Lead  Industries  (NLI)  contracted  with  the  Department  of  Energy  and
processed uranium at Colonie NY in the period 1958–84, but in its latter years was
environmentally  negligent,  badly  polluting  with  depleted  uranium  aerosols  the  sur-
rounding site and community. The amount of Depleted Uranium (DU) aerosol emis-
sions  were  comparable  to  the  total  respirable  DU  released  in  the  entire  1991  Gulf
War, highlighting the significant pollution issue. In 2003–04, the ATSDR conducted
a  relatively  superficial  examination  of  the  health  consequences  of  the  pollution  of
this  site.  The  report  lacked  depth  and  substance,  failed  to  address  community  con-
cerns  with  adequate  scientific  data  and  explanation,  it  conducted  no  new  research
at  the  site,  and  presented  a  confusing  picture  of  the  toxic  hazards.  It  did  not  draw
upon  the  best  science  available.  The  site  was  remediated  (completion  2007)  by  the
Army  Corps  of  Engineers,  costing  more  than  $190M.  The  ATSDR  consultation  sig-
nificantly  concluded  that  there  was  a  real  and  significant  health  risk  to  the  public
from depleted uranium oxide emissions from the plant stack during its active years
(1958–1982),  but  it  decided  not  to  pursue  any  environmental  surveying  or  health
surveillance activities for poorly articulated reasons. Planned actions related to ura-
nium  were  not  done  subsequent  to  the  report’s  publication.  The  liaison  with  the
local community appeared to be relatively poor, delivering little in the way of satis-
factory  communication,  and  no  perceived  benefit.  No  new  insight  on  the  situation
was presented that was not already apparent and the nature of uranium toxicology
was  not  well  balanced.  In  several  respects  it  failed  to  take  advantage  of  the  best
science available to address the issues at the site. It offered little in the way of com-
ment  on  how  to  redress  the  health  concerns  of  the  community.  In  most  respects

other  than  providing  information  on  toxins,  it  failed  to  deliver  its  remit  for  the
Colonie site.

My UK research group, beginning in 2004, investigated the nature of the uranium
aerosols, made isotope measurements that documented the isotope characteristics of
the source emissions, studied particle dissolution in the natural environment—a pa-
rameter relevant to their solubility, extended the survey of uranium pollution much
more  widely,  and  studied  the  mobility  of  uranium  in  soils  and  plants,  all  in  order
to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  environmental  pollution.  We  also  worked
closely  with  the  community  to  identify  former  workers  and  residents  who  lived  or
worked in or near the plant for many years during its operation, in order to gather
oral history of events and practices in the plant and to identify part of the exposed
cohort  for  potential  health  screening.  TSDR  evidently  decided  that  this  type  of  ap-
proach was not possible or would not be a productive activity. It was instead feasible
and  useful,  and  not  particularly  costly.  We  had  already  developed  a  urine  uranium
isotope test that was capable of detecting trace depleted uranium in urine. We then
tested  a  small  cohort  of  residents  and  former  workers  and  clearly  showed  that  our
method  was  capable  of  identifying  a  substantial  exposure  to  depleted  uranium
aerosols  more  than  20  years  after  exposure.  This  clearly  offered  a  way  forward  to
link  health  outcomes  to  exposures  at  Colonie,  something  ATSDR  in  2004  decided
was not possible.

There  is  a  breath-taking  lack  of  environmental  and  community  justice  in  the
Colonie  situation.  While  the  polluter,  National  Lead  Industries,  was  absolved  two
decades ago by the U.S. Government of responsibility and while the Army Corps of
Engineers spent nearly λ200M on site cleanup, no Federal Government monies have
been  spent  on  even  a  modest-scope  targeted  health  study  to  identify  what  if  any
health  outcomes  have  occurred  for  the  exposed  cohort  of  people  who  for  years  lived
near or worked in the site during its active years of uranium pollution. The commu-
nity  has  been  left  with  no  research,  no  credible  way  forward,  little  or  no  redress,
and  a  significant  environmental  pollution  legacy  with  a  reasonable  probability  of
some consequences to health of those affected.

Much could have been learned about the environmental health issue of aerosol de-
pleted  uranium  emissions  had  ATSDR  acted  differently;  this  could  have  informed
U.S.  Government  policy  as  it  pertains  to  Veterans’  Health  related  to  DU  munitions
exposure in the battlefield (Gulf Wars I and II) and potentially helped provide vital
data  to  test  any  potential  connection  between  Gulf  War  Illness  and  depleted  ura-
nium  exposure.  It  would  certainly  have  improved  the  medical  knowledge  database
on the inhalation hazard of respirable uranium oxide particles, a relatively rare tox-
icological pathway which does not currently have benefit of any systematic study of
an  exposed  population,  to  my  knowledge.  The  need  for  additional  research  at  the
Colonie  site  is  as  acute  now  as  it  was  in  2003–04  when  the  ATSDR  conducted  its
Health Consultation.

My remit—instructions from Congressional subcommittee

The  Subcommittee  has  asked  me  to  do  two  things:  summarize  my  investigations
into  the  National  Lead  Industries  (NLI)  Colonie  NY  site  and  critique  the  2004
Colonie ATSDR report and suggest how to improve its environmental health assess-
ments  in  the  future.  My  contribution  herein  is  largely  concerned  with  the  uranium
issues at Colonie, not the full menu of pollution-related toxins.

Background and current position; summary of expertise

I  am  Randall  R.  Parrish  and  occupy  a  joint  position  of  Professor  of  Isotope  Geo-
science, University of Leicester (UK) and Head of the UK Natural Environment Re-
search  Council  Isotope  Geosciences  Laboratory,  a  national  isotope  research  and
analysis  facility  serving  the  UK  scientific,  mainly  the  academic  scientific  commu-
nity. I have occupied this joint post since 1996. More details on my expertise, skills,
publications,  research  and  so  forth  is  contained  in  the  CV  and  biography  provided
as part of the requested testimony.

I  conduct  research  in  many  areas  of  geo-  and  environmental  science,  but  have  a
particular  expertise  in  analysis  of  uranium  and  lead  isotopes  using  high  sensitivity
mass spectrometry and am a recognized authority in this area. I have published ex-
tensively  using  such  methods,  mainly  in  geoscience  in  the  field  of  geochronology—
the  determination  of  the  age  of  rocks  and  minerals  using  radioactive  decay  of  Ura-
nium. Although most of my research has been and continues to be in Earth science,
since 2003 I have applied this expertise to environmental health research on topics
that  relate  to  the  issue  of  depleted  uranium  (DU)  pollution  and  health.  Our  work
has had some impact on how the UK government approaches its duty of care to the
UK soldiers that may have been exposed to depleted uranium munitions and its en-

vironmental  consequences.  I  developed  a  keen  interest  in  this  problem  because  of
the  lack  of  thorough  relevant  studies,  its  novelty,  and  the  fact  that  it  was  and  still
is an issue in dire need of sound scientific data to combat the huge amount of media
and  political  noise  surrounding  ‘depleted  uranium’  and  its  potential  relationship  to
Gulf War Illness.

The wider justification for study of the Colonie site

The overriding reason that I got involved in research at the National Lead Indus-
tries  Colonie  NY  site  was  to  try  to  solve  a  long-standing  problem:  how  long  does
inhaled DU oxide reside in the human body and what relationship, if any, does such
an  exposure  have  on  human  health  and  how  might  it  be  quantified?  In  spite  of  no-
tions  to  the  contrary,  this  problem  has  not  been  solved  because no cohort of peo-
ple  exposed  by  inhalation  to  this  particular  toxin  has  been  adequately
studied. As it turns out the NLI Colonie NY site is virtually unique in its relevance
to this issue, quite apart from the intrinsic need to address the environmental stew-
ardship  and  potential  health  issues  of  this  highly  polluted  site.  My  role  has  been
to provide the analytical and environmental science to address this problem. I hope
my  testimony  will  clarify  your  understanding  of  the  problem  and  the  perspective  I
have on the 2004 Colonie ATSDR Health Consultation.

Some observations about the Colonie situation

• The uranium pollution at Colonie originated at the former National Lead In-
dustries  site;  all  agencies  appear  to  accept  that  there  is  no  other  credible
source for the uranium pollution there. From my knowledge base, I agree.
• The  uranium  pollution  is  primarily  composed  of  depleted  uranium  oxide  aer-
osol particles, which have a distinctive isotope composition with some limited
variability;  we  have  measured  this  extensively  in  our  studies.  My  Ph.D.  stu-
dent published an article on this just last week—it is appended in these docu-
ments.
• The  uranium  pollution  at  Colonie  occurred  as  a  result  of  environmental  neg-
ligence of National Lead Industries through inadequate filtration and capture
of combusted depleted uranium metal waste.
• The  period  of  active  pollution  was  ∼1958–1982  and  aerosol  pollution  ceased
with plant closure, though re-suspension of polluted soil undoubtedly occurred
after plant closure.
• Our  recent  research  has  shown  that  household  dust  may  have  unacceptably
high  levels  of  DU;  this  may  be  a  risk  to  health  if  disturbed—a  potential
health  issue,  and  certainly  a  perceived  concern  of  the  community  at  the
present time.
• ATSDR’s 2004 principle conclusion of merit was that the level of airborne ra-
dioactivity  emitted  from  the  plant  represented  a  distinct  health  risk  during
plant  operation.  The  ATSDR  report’s  lack  of  recommendations  concerning
past  risk  to  health  was  a  puzzling  omission  from  the  report  and  an  obvious
source of frustration to the community.
• The  ATSDR  2004  report  has  an  overemphasis  on  ingestion  exposure  to  DU
by  comparison  with  the  acknowledged  more  hazardous  inhalation  pathway,
because the latter may lead to long-term internal radiation whilst the former
is likely to be cleared quickly in the intestinal tract. This is all the more im-
portant  since  our  recent  research  has  shown  that  the  uranium  aerosol  pollu-
tion  at  Colonie  is  very  weakly  soluble,  and  contains  a  significant  proportion
of  respirable  particles.  This  de-emphasis  of  the  inhalation  exposure  pathway
is a significant weakness of the report.
• In the assessment of health risks and exposures, what is important is getting
at an estimate of the cumulative inhalation uranium exposure of workers and
residents;  this  is  not  simple.  It  needs  to  be  appreciated  that  it  is  entirely
wrong to conclude that because urinary uranium levels are relatively low now
that there was/is no health issue. In this ‘historic exposure situation’ the com-
parison  of  current  excretion  levels  in  relation  to  the  overall  population  is  a
flawed basis for health risk assessment.
• The  task  of  calculating  a  cumulative  historic  inhalation  uranium  oxide  dose
is  complex,  but  can  be  modelled  using  existing,  relatively  well  accepted  bio-
kinetic  models  along  with  a  range  of  solubilities  of  DU  oxide  particles,  using
experimental  data,  and  estimates  of  excretion  of  inhaled  DU.  The  U.S.  Army
Capstone (∼2004) report specifically investigated this issue; the ATSDR report
was apparently unaware of it and in any case chose not to pursue this avenue

of investigation. A fairly thorough discussion of this topic was available in the
period  2000–2004  and  for  example  is  contained  in  the  Royal  Society  report
on DU (2001). I have included an explanation of this later in the written testi-
mony  explaining  how  current  excretion  levels  of  DU  can  be  used  to  calculate
the  much  larger  quantities  of  inhaled  uranium  during  an  historic  exposure.
• The detection of depleted uranium as a component of the urinary uranium ex-
creted  by  affected  people  is  a  challenging  but  feasible  measurement;  it  was
feasible  in  2003–04  (via  for  example  the  UK  DUOB  website)  when  ATSDR
concluded  there  was  no  method  available,  but  it  had  yet  to  be  published  in
the refereed literature.

• The  quantity  of  inhalable  DU  oxide  deposited  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Colonie
Plant  is  comparable  to  the  total  aerosolized  inhalable  DU  oxide  produced  in
the entire 1991 Gulf War conflict; in Colonie, >95 percent of this quantity was
deposited  within  2km  radius  of  the  NLI  plant;  in  the  1991  Gulf  conflict,  the
area of dispersion in Iraq-Kuwait was very much larger and partly in sparse-
ly  inhabited  areas  along  the  Basra  Road.  Thus  the  environmental  pollution
and health risk is likely to have been much higher for Colonie residents than
for  Gulf  War  veterans.  This  sobering  perspective  has  never  been  appreciated
or  recognized  and  is  all  the  more  unbalanced  when  considering  how  funds
have been spent on research into DU and health.

• No credible well-designed health assessment has been funded or conducted at
Colonie; yet, >$190M has been spent on the NLI cleanup within its perimeter
fence, not to mention funding allocated to ATSDR for its Health Consultation
and  that  dedicated  to  other  DU-Health  research  such  as  the  Capstone  study
of the U.S. Army. This whole funding situation appears perverse, misdirected,
and  lacking  a  natural  sense  of  balance  (one  could  say  fairness  &  justice),  in
my opinion.

• In  my  opinion  the  ‘zip  code’  based  cancer  occurrence  ‘studies’  cited  by  the
ATSDR  Health  Consultation  and  conducted  by  NY  State  agencies  were  un-
likely  to  accurately  identify  any  significant  rise  in  illness  that  might  have
arisen  from  long-term  significant  inhalation  exposure  to  DU  from  the  NLI
plant  of  a  cohort  of  heavily  exposed  workers  or  residents.  The  movement  of
people  with  time  in  and  out  of  the  area,  the  lack  of  tracking  of  the  most  ex-
posed  few  hundred  individuals,  and  the  study  of  former  workers  unlikely  to
have lived nearby meant that this type of study was doomed from the begin-
ning  of  delivering  insight.  Why  ATSDR  opted  to  not  design  a  more  targeted
study  or  to  more  intelligently  discuss  the  shortcomings  of  these  NY  State
studies  is  baffling  to  me,  and  no  doubt  a  serious  source  of  frustration  to  the
community.

• The studies that I and my team have conducted at Colonie, both urinary test-
ing  (on  a  small  scale)  and  environmental  surveying,  have  been  modest  in
scale and cost, and were entirely feasible at the time of the 2004 ATSDR Con-
sultation; the ATSDR paper made no recommendations to undertake any such
study.
• Unfortunately  the  2004  ATSDR  Health  Consultation  undertook  no  new  re-
search  and  seemed  uninterested  in  such  follow-up  work;  while  clearly  recog-
nizing the inherent health risk of the plant, the paper concluded without rec-
ommending  any  way  of  redressing  the  community  concerns  about  uranium
pollution,  whether  well-founded  or  not.  It  is  no  wonder  that  the  report  satis-
fied few.
• I have solicited feedback about the 2004 report by the Community Concerned
about National Lead; their comments are very critical of ATSDR. This is pri-
marily  because  while  the  health  hazard  was  clearly  admitted,  no  rec-
ommendations  for  new  research  or  health  screening  were  made,  for  reasons
that were poorly articulated and justified. As a scientist, I too find a puzzling
lack of credible justification for the lack of action arising from the report. The
report has therefore made little if any contribution to knowledge or public un-
derstanding  of  the  scientific  and  health  issues  of  the  Colonie  site  that  were
not already available.

Our research at Colonie 2004–2009

With information from several sources, in ∼2004 I recognized the unique situation
of  significant  historic  uranium  aerosol  inhalation  exposure  of  a  large  urban  popu-
lation  in  Colonie,  a  mixed  industrial-residential  part  of  Albany  NY.  Its  attributes
of interest were:

(1) there was a great amount of uranium pollution;
(2) the nature of the pollution was primarily by aerosol deposition of combusted

uranium oxide particles;

(3) it  took  place  over  a  long  period  of  time  but  ceased  more  than  25  years  ago;
(4) many individuals who had lived through the active period of aerosol deposi-

tion were still living in the area; and,

(5) it  seemed  certain  that  if  individuals  living  there  also  had  aerosol-contami-
nated  soil,  then  they  would  have  inhaled  the  toxin  over  a  long  period  of
time.
It thus appeared to be a well-controlled experiment where one had an opportunity
to  address  the  health  impacts  of  those  exposed  to  inhaled  DU,  and  that  such  study
might  have  a  bearing  on  the  larger  issue  of  inhaled  DU  and  Veterans’  Health.
Though this latter problem falls outside of the remit of ATSDR, I think it is impor-
tant for Members of the Committee to gain a perspective on how the Colonie exam-
ple  could  benefit  and  contribute  to  other  scientific  issues  of  acute  interest  to  the
American Government, namely the health of Gulf War(s) Veterans.

Chronological perspective on DU research and the Colonie site

To  provide  a  better  perspective,  I  will  outline  the  pertinent  events  leading  up  to
the  present  that  bear  on  my  research  at  Colonie,  DU  and  Health,  and  the  ATSDR
consultation.

In chronological order, they are:

tional Lead; DU munitions production shifts to other U.S. plants.

neers within the former National Lead Industries site costing >$190M.

• 1958–1982: Colonie site uranium pollution;
• ∼1984;  U.S.  Government  accepts  responsibility  of  site  from  the  polluter,  Na-
• 1982–2007: Assessment of site and major remediation by Army Corps of Engi-
• 2001: publication of the WHO and Royal Society papers on Depleted Uranium
and  Health,  during  a  period  when  DU  was  a  major  issue  in  the  American,
Canadian, and UK media.
• 2001:  UK  government  established  the  Depleted  Uranium  Oversight  Board
(DUOB) to oversee and undertake a voluntary program of testing of veterans
who may have been exposed to DU through service primarily in the 1991 Gulf
Conflict. The minutes of this Board were available.
• The  DUOB  undertook  to  establish  a  reliable  urinary  DU  exposure  test  that
could potentially detect a milligram-sized inhaled DU dose after 10 years had
passed,  in  order  to  satisfy  the  concerns  of  potentially  exposed  veterans.  This
test was available as of late 2003. This was to be a much more sensitive test
than  was  available  any  where  else  in  the  world.  The  program  of  testing  took
place  between  2004  and  2006.  To  my  knowledge  this  capability  currently  ex-
ists only in the UK and possibly Germany.
• The NIGL laboratory of which I am Director was one facility offering this test
and it was engaged in the analysis of many hundreds of urine samples during
this period. I played a key role in this development and testing.
• The  Final  Report  of  the  DUOB  testing  program  (published  eventually  in
• Because  of  the  preponderance  of  DU-negative  results,  even  in  2004  part  way
through  the  program,  I  felt  that  there  were  two  explanations  possible  for
these results:

2007) showed that no individual tested in the program was DU-positive.

(1) Some of the veterans were significantly exposed to DU but the passage
of time had ensured that residual DU contamination was undetectable;
thus health harm may have occurred without a DU-positive test.

(2) The  veterans  with  DU-negative  test  results  were  not  significantly  ex-

posed to DU.

Unfortunately  there  was  no  study  available  at  the  time  to  quantify  the  resi-
dence time of inhaled DU oxide particles, and both alternatives remained via-
ble  explanations  of  the  data;  the  debate  in  the  UK  concerning  DU  exposure
and Health therefore could not yet be fully resolved.
• In  the  period  around  2001–2004  unpublished  information  became  available
from  Iraqi  medical  officials  of  an  apparently  progressive  and  significant  rise
in unusual cancers and birth defects throughout the 1990s; this was not clear-
ly verified but Iraqi and some western medical officials attributed this to DU
exposure.  This  added  some  anecdotal  evidence  that  there  might  be  a  DU–

Health connection even though other reports were suggesting that the connec-
tion between DU and Gulf War Illness was weak.
• In  2004  I  learned  of  the  Colonie  site;  as  noted  earlier  in  this  testimony,  it
appeared  to  involve  a  significant  aerosol  DU  oxide  pollution  footprint  in  an
urban  area,  with  the  implication  that  it  was  likely  that  many  people  had  a
DU  oxide  inhalation  exposure;  thus  it  to  me  seemed  worth  pursuing  since  it
offered  a  way  to  resolve  the  alternatives  expressed  above  about  the  interpre-
tation of the DUOB DU-negative results.
• With considerable anticipation of new insight, I read the ATSDR 2004 report,
and while pleased to read of its conclusion that the uranium emissions during
the  plant’s  active  period  was  hazardous,  I  was  quite  disappointed  with  its
lack  of  new  data/research  and  its  lack  of  tangible  actions  and  recommenda-
tions for the future. To my knowledge no follow up work was done by ATSDR
related to uranium.
• In  2004  I  initiated  a  research  project  at  Colonie,  aimed  at  providing  (1)  a
modern  environmental  study  to  document  the  nature  and  mobility  in  the  en-
vironment of the DU oxide aerosols and (2) urinary tests of potentially signifi-
cantly  exposed  individuals  (former  workers  of  the  plant  and  residents  who
had  lived  nearby  for  years)  to  determine  whether  any  urinary  DU  could  be
detected. A Ph.D. student (Nicholas Lloyd) was given the environmentally-ori-
ented  project,  while  I  undertook  the  urinary  testing.  We  cooperated  in  these
studies with colleagues at the University at Albany (Dr. David Carpenter and
Dr.  John  Arnason).  Funding  for  this  work  was  provided  by  the  British  Geo-
logical Survey and the UK Natural Environment Research Council.
• In  latest  2004  the  analysis  of  the  Colonie  urine  samples  showed  that  it  was
possible  to  detect  DU  in  humans  more  than  20–25  years  following  exposure
(eventually  published  in  2008).  This  allowed  one  to  favor  one  interpretation
of the DUOB-tested Gulf War veterans—that they had not acquired a signifi-
cant  DU  inhalation  dose.  We  knew  in  latest  2004  that  our  method  of  testing
offered  a  way  forward  to  identify  and  potentially  quantify  the  cumulative  in-
halation  dose  of  DU  for  the  Colonie  exposed  population;  this  conclusion  had
very  important  implications  for  any  follow-on  actions  arising  from  the  2004
ATSDR report.
• Our  environmental  study  data  was  progressively  completed  in  the  period

2005–2008; it had several important conclusions, namely:

(1) DU  in  soil  profiles  has  very  limited  mobility,  indicating  a  lack  of  rapid

dissolution of DU in the natural environment;

(2) Particles  of  DU  oxide  aerosol  could  be  located  and  studied  in  contami-
nated  soil,  and  in  household  dry  dusts,  and  after  study  (using  a  syn-
chrotron  X-ray  source),  it  was  confirmed  that  UO2 was  the  principle
chemical component, a finding that is expected in thoroughly combusted
material; UO2 is the least soluble of any uranium oxide.

(3) UO2 particles  form  a  minor  component  of  the  man-made  metal  oxide
aerosol  particles  contained  in  soil;  the  bulk  of  the  remainder  mainly
consists of lead particles.

(4) Particles  of  UO2 within  soil  were  found  to  have  suffered  minor  (gen-
erally  <10  percent)  dissolution  by  being  subject  to  natural  weathering
for  more  than  25  years;  this  confirms  that  the  combustion  product  aer-
osol emissions from Colonie were relatively insoluble.

(5) Samples of trees, plants, berries, etc., growing on contaminated soil con-
tain DU; this indicates that some component of DU is soluble and taken
up in plants.

(6) No  sample  of  soil  collected  to  date,  including  those  up  to  seven  km
(minus five miles) from the NLI site, is free of DU; the pollution plume
is much larger than was originally thought.

(7) With  our  data,  a  calculation  of  the  total  mass  of  DU  emitted  from  the
plant  was  made,  the  resultant  quantity  being  approximately  10  metric
tons (give or take a few). This is comparable to the total aerosolized DU
oxide  produced  by  the  Allied  Forces  in  the  entire  1991  Gulf  Conflict,
demonstrating  the  relative  magnitude  and  concentration  of  DU  in  the
Colonie site.

effort  to  obtain  NY  State  funding  for  a  credible  targeted  follow-up  health
study  of  affected  residents/workers  of  the  NLI  site;  this  activity  is  ongoing.

Critique of the ATSDR Health Consultation

Prior  to  making  some  criticism  of  the  document,  it  is  important  to  note  the

strengths of the 2004 ATSDR Colonie Health Consultation, namely:

• It provided a good review and summary of the history of the site and all pre-
vious  investigations,  and  brought  together  information  from  a  variety  of
sources.
• It  used  measurements  of  emissions  of  radioactivity  from  the  site  available
from  environmental  monitoring  to  conclude  that  there  was  a  significant
health  risk  to  those  who  lived  nearby  during  the  period  of  active  emissions.
• It  made  an  effort  to  have  meetings  with  the  community  to  present  its  find-
• It recommended two specific actions related to the NLI plant, namely,

ings, take note of concerns before preparing its final report.

(1) ATSDR will work with local physicians and provide information on tak-
ing  patients’  environmental  exposure  histories.  ATSDR  will  also  make
available  resources  related  to  environmental  exposure,  including  con-
taminant-specific case studies and fact sheets.

(2) ATSDR  is  evaluating  the  feasibility  of  conducting  a  study  that  would
compare the mortality rates of former NL workers to the mortality rates
of  the  general  public.  Former  workers  likely  received  the  highest  expo-
sures  to  depleted  uranium  from  1958  to  1984  during  operation  of  the
facility. Currently, ATSDR is determining whether relevant past worker
records exist.

Unfortunately  it  also  had  many  shortcomings.  I  will  outline  what  I  feel  are
the most important problems rather than undertake a detailed critique.
• The  study  presents  a  skewed  and  narrow  portrayal  of  the  potential  hazards
of  DU  in  that  it  over-emphasized  the  ingestion-related  pathway  and  under-
played  the  inhalation  hazard.  This  may  have  been  influenced  by  the  lack  of
published  literature  on  health  impacts  to  cohorts  exposed  to  inhaled  DU—a
situation  arising  because  of  the  rarity  of  such  incidents.  The  report  appears
to have used the lack of literature to downplay the importance of this problem
instead of undertaking a credible analysis of the inhalation hazard with avail-
able data and models. This should have been done, but was not. The analysis
of  the  Royal  Society  (2001),  WHO  (2001)  and  Depleted  Uranium  Oversight
Boards  (website  2001  onwards)  had  fairly  thorough  treatment  of  this  issue,
but these sources of information evidently failed to influence the report.
• The  discussion  on  pages  15–16  concerns  the  health  risks  of  exposure,  path-
ways  of  exposure,  and  health  survey  design  analysis.  It  has  undoubtedly  left
members  of  the  public  confused  because  it  contains  inconsistencies,  is  partly
wrong,  lacks  detailed  logic  and  explanation,  and  is  sort  of  a  shopping  list  of
assertions and conclusions without satisfactory elaboration.
This  section  should  have  explained  the  inhalation  hazard  and  its  con-
sequences in detail, since this was the main exposure pathway for the Colonie
area  (i.e.,  by  breathing  aerosols  during  the  plants  operation).  In  my  opinion,
addressing  the  health  hazard  of  DU  oxide  inhalation  exposure  is  the  single
most important reason to have conducted this Health Consultation. Therefore
it  should  have  noted  the  relative  magnitude  of  pollution  of  the  site—one  of
the  largest  concentrations  of  DU  aerosol  pollution  in  the  world,  if  not  the
largest.  It  should  have  explained  that  the  consequences  of  inhalation  of  res-
pirable particles of DU oxide would lead to long residence times in the lungs,
on  the  order  of  years,  with  consequent  internal  organ  irradiation  by  alpha
emitters and the likely illness that a major dose of such radiation could have
led  to.  It  should  have  sharply  contrasted  the  differences  between  the  inhala-
tion  and  ingestion  pathways  and  their  implications  of  short  (with  ingestion)
and long (with inhalation) residence times in lungs. It should have mentioned
the consequences to subsequent urinary testing of these two ingestion and in-
halation  scenarios.  It  could  have  and  should  have  summarized  biokinetic
models  that  are  in  theory  capable  of  modelling  (i.e.,  predicting  retrospec-
tively) the magnitude of cumulative inhalation dose if the time elapsed since
exposure  was  known  and  if  the  daily  excretion  of  DU  can  be  determined.  It
should  also  have  outlined  generally  the  method  of  detection  (i.e.,  explained
what bioassays methods were available, especially the isotope tests) and their

detection limits, to explain to the public whether or not tests available at the
time were capable of detecting such residual DU in urine. It should have ac-
knowledged  that  a  urinary  measurement  made  more  than  20  years  after  ex-
posure would be expected, even with very large initial exposure, to be orders
of magnitude lower in concentration than it would have been initially. There
is much missing in this section; only ATSDR officials can provide the ration-
ale  for  such  a  superficial  treatment  of  some  of  these  issues.  The  section  ap-
pears to avoid dealing with the main issue.
• The statement on top of page 16 states that if DU had been found in urinary
tests,  that  such  tests  would  be  incapable  of  indicating  ‘where  the  DU  came
from.’  This  is  largely  wrong;  isotope  analysis  is  a  very  powerful  technique  to
establish plausible links (or refute them) between sources and exposures. This
is all the more surprising since they discuss the NLI plant as the only source
of DU for the uranium pollution of the site (on page 19). There is essentially
a  dismissal  of  the  role  that  isotope  analysis  of  uranium  could  play  in  testing
this link. The report shows a lack of insight and understanding of this whole
area  of  measurement.  This  is  all  the  more  surprising  since  analytical  labora-
tories  within  CDC  itself  are  conducting  research  into  such  measurements  of
uranium in urine. Perhaps there is a lack of joined up communication within
CDC in this regard. One could be forgiven for concluding that they just were
not interested in recommending any kind of urinary uranium testing.
• Pages  16–17  discuss  the  issue  of  existing  health  surveys  and  the  possibility
of  a  new  health  assessment.  I  found  this  an  exceptional  frustrating  aspect  of
the  study  and  the  single  most  disappointing  part  of  the  paper.  Having  con-
cluded already that there was a significant health risk from uranium aerosols
during  the  plant’s  emission  history,  they  use  these  two  pages  to  first  explain
why  the  earlier  zip  code  surveys  of  NY  State  officials  could  not  have  worked
in  identifying  any  possible  excess  of  cancers  arising  from  the  plant.  I  would
have thought this would have prompted them to explain how a well-designed
health  survey  ought  to  be  designed  for  this  situation,  but  they  failed  to  do
this.  Instead,  on  page  17  the  report  appears  to  signal  a  resignation  that  no
possible  survey  could  be  designed  that  might  identify  whether  or  not  excess
illness  might  have  arisen  in  the  cohort  of  exposed  individuals.  This  is  not  a
satisfactory outcome of a Health Consultation of this type.
To provide a satisfactory basis for doing nothing, they needed to explain why
it  would  have  been  impossible  to  conduct  a  survey  to  locate  former  workers
at  the  plant  and  individuals  who  lived  in  close  proximity  to  the  plant  for
many years. These people could have been ranked in terms of potential expo-
sure  by  duration  of  exposure,  and  proximity  to  areas  of  very  high  uranium
in soil (as a proxy for the aerosol uranium concentration).
Ironically  the  Concerned  Citizens  about  National  Lead  group  was  able  to
gather  a  lot  of  this  sort  of  information  and  had  some  of  it  at  the  time  of  the
report’s  writing.  In  our  work  we  used  their  information  effectively.  In  my
time  dealing  with  the  Colonie  site,  I  have  had  conversations  with  residents
of a street adjacent the site in the heavily exposed pollution halo who commu-
nicated  an  alarming  number  of  health  issues  (mainly  cancers)  and  deaths  in
the  past  25  years  in  houses  in  that  particular  area.  Precautionary  instincts
suggest  this  ought  to  be  investigated  as  a  priority.  No  questions  of  this  type
were asked by the Consultation. This to me seems a major oversight.
• Part  of  the  reason  not  to  pursue  further  health  assessments  appears  to  have
been predicated on the perceived inability to detect a low percentage of excess
cancers that might be attributed to the pollution in a much larger cohort pop-
ulation (thousands of people). I fully agree that to use the thousands of people
in a current zip code as the ‘exposed population’ is a poor experimental design
for a health assessment of the Colonie situation. Such an approach stands no
chance  of  succeeding  in  being  insightful  for  the  Colonie  situation  where  only
a relatively small number of individuals (probably less than 1,000) was likely
to have suffered a significant inhalation dose. This is in essence the flaw with
the former NY State surveys. However, to do nothing and recommend nothing
in the face of this is not a satisfactory option or outcome.
Instead,  the  report  should  have  recommended  conducting  a  survey  on  the
most  exposed  group  of  people;  it  should  have  located  the  several  hundred
most  heavily  exposed  individuals,  wherever  they  might  now  live,  in  addition
to  collecting  death  statistics  from  cancer  (for  example)  from  those  who  for-
merly lived near the site during its active years. This type of systematic cen-
sus work is both necessary and feasible. The health issues with this targeted

cohort could have been studied to either (1) discover any alarming illness pat-
terns) relative to the general population, or (2) show that nothing was identi-
fiably anomalous. Had the survey identified excess illnesses, then a campaign
of  appropriate-sensitivity  uranium  isotope  testing  could  have  been  commis-
sioned to see whether DU could be identified as part of the excreted uranium,
in  order  to  provide  quantitative  data  on  possible  past  exposure  to  DU.  This
is the sort of investigation that would have been a satisfactory outcome to the
ATSDR report; it needn’t have been hugely expensive or undertake the work.
• The ATSDR authors were aware of inhalation exposure computer models that
could be used to make predictions on exposure of an inhaled compound using
particle grain size, airborne concentration at the point of emission, density of
particles,  and  meteorological  data.  They  could  have  made  assumptions  about
particle size and density and used existing meteorological data to do this, but
they  did  not.  Give  the  relative  ease  with  which  our  own  research  was  able
to isolate particles from contaminated soil or household dust, and study their
general size, shape and composition, the lack of interest or awareness of this
avenue  of  investigation  represents  a  significant  oversight,  and  may  indicate
a  lack  of  interest  in  pursuing  a  credible,  reasonably  in-depth  investigation
into the DU pollution.

• On  pages  30–31  in  addressing  direct  concerns  of  the  community  the  report
provides  a  misleading  answer  by  failing  to  mention  the  dangers  of  internal
alpha  radiation  (in  lungs  in  inhalation  exposure)  after  noting  that  airborne
emissions  were  the  main  hazard;  the  report  obfuscates  the  issue  here  by  ap-
pealing to the benign nature of alpha radiation to skin, which mixes up inter-
nal and external doses. This confusion was entirely unnecessary.

• On  page  35  in  addressing  the  5th  concern  of  the  community,  the  report  ex-
plains  the  challenges  in  designing  a  health  survey  and  attributing  any  out-
comes  to  NLI  pollution.  A  lot  of  the  reason  the  report  recommends  that  no
health  survey  would  work  is  because  the  report  concluded  there  was  no
means  of  establishing  a  distinct  exposure  to  DU.  The  authors  would  have
known  that  standard  existing  uranium  bioassays  and  uranium  isotope  urine
tests had defined limits of detection that would limit the ability of these tests
to  detect  DU.  They  should  have  realized  that  significant  progress  had  been
made on method improvement and that further improvement in reducing de-
tection  limits  would  be  likely.  They  should  have  noted  this  in  the  report  and
recommended  that  should  methods  become  available  that  could  potentially
quantify the past exposure via a urine test, that this whole issue should have
been revisited. They should have recommended this be done.

• On  page  37–38  are  the  conclusive  recommendations  and  ‘planned  actions’
arising  from  the  Consultation.  No  recommendations  are  made  with  regards
to DU exposure at all. In the planned actions are mentioned the following two
items:

1) ATSDR  will  work  with  local  physicians  and  provide  information  on  tak-
ing  patients’  environmental  exposure  histories.  ATSDR  will  also  make
available  resources  related  to  environmental  exposure,  including  con-
taminant-specific case studies and fact sheets.

2) ATSDR  is  evaluating  the  feasibility  of  conducting  a  study  that  would
compare the mortality rates of former NL workers to the mortality rates
of  the  general  public.  Former  workers  likely  received  the  highest  expo-
sures to depleted uranium from 1958 to 1984 during operation of the fa-
cility.  Currently,  ATSDR  is  determining  whether  relevant  past  worker
records exist.

I  am  not  aware  that  there  has  been  any  progress  on  these  two  ‘planned  actions’;
I  have  also  checked  with  CCNL,  the  main  community  group  and  they  agree  that
no action on these was done following the publication of the Consultation. This has
increased  the  sense  of  frustration  by  the  community  and  is  to  say  the  least,  puz-
zling. ATSDR should comment on this lack of follow-up actions, if in fact this is the
case.

Scientific Recommendations to address environmental health issues at NLI

Colonie NY site

The  ATSDR  report  has  failed  to  resolve  any  of  the  outstanding  environmental
health  issues  arising  from  NLI  pollution  at  Colonie.  A  sensible  course  of  action  for
ATSDR  for  the  future  would  be  to  embrace  the  shortcomings  of  its  report  and  take

a  new  approach  putting  in  place  a  number  of  actions  to  make  some  substantial
progress. For example,

177

• Community consultation in light of this hearing and recent research
• Establish funding for limited health assessment study
• Exposure  screening  of  cohort  with  highest  likelihood  of  significant  inhalation

exposures—workers and residents, perhaps several hundred individuals

• Design and implement targeted health assessment of cohort, including inves-
tigation of death statistics of those likely to have had a relatively heavy expo-
sure

• Evaluate  health  data  using  precautionary  ethos  given  the  small  cohort  size
• Investigate further cleanup of indoor and outdoor properties where resuspen-

sion of heavily contaminated dust could be a problem.

Comments on the ATSDR mission/remit and its performance

The  remit  of  ATSDR  Health  Consultations  is  articulated  in  the  ATSDR  website
is to ‘‘serve the public by using the best science, taking responsive public health ac-
tions,  and  providing  trusted  health  information  to  prevent  harmful  exposures  and
diseases related to toxic substances’’.

At Colonie, while noting the useful case history of the site and especially its main
conclusion that there existing a substantial health risk from uranium emissions dur-
ing the active years of the NLI plant, the Agency in my opinion has failed to locate,
present,  and  apply  the  best  science  to  Colonie,  and  when  combined  with  the  lack
of  any  identifiable  responsive  health  actions  arising  from  its  investment  of  re-
sources, it is hard to conclude that in this case, it has come anywhere near fulfilling
its mission.

Recommendations to Congress concerning ATSDR

ATSDR’s remit forms an important component of public health policy and mitiga-
tion  in  the  United  States  by  undertaking  prompt  assessment  and  recommending  a
course of action to mitigate toxic hazard risks and derive new knowledge concerning
unusual toxin situations. The work is important and needs to be highly credible and
to reflect the best knowledge available anywhere.

The  Colonie  example  shows  that  ATSDR  needs  to  work  considerably  harder  in

order deliver credible assessments and solutions commensurate with its remit.

In  cases  like  Colonie  where  it  appears  it  had  insufficient  experience  with  an  un-
usual  hazard  (in  this  case  the  inhalation  hazard  of  uranium  oxides)  it  needs  to  en-
sure  that  it  taps  into  the  best  knowledge  available,  not  just  the  in  house  expertise.
The  Colonie  consultation  could  have  been  miles  better  if  it  had  acquired  an  up  to
date  knowledge  of  concurrent  activities  taking  place  on  this  same  hazard  in  other
government  agencies  (U.S.  Army  research  on  DU  inhalation;  CDC  uranium  isotope
measurement; National Academy of Sciences reports on DU) and in other countries
(UK  DUOB  screening  program,  Royal  Society  biokinetic  models  of  inhaled  uranium
exposure and health risks for example). They appear to have failed to ‘leave no rea-
sonable stone unturned’ in the Colonie study.

Governments (and certain industries) may fear what they might uncover by doing
a thorough study into a politically-charged issue like depleted uranium. My view is
that  it  is  best  to  be  transparent,  face  up  to  the  risks  of  doing  the  credible  science
where  it  appears  justified  both  fiscally  and  scientifically,  do  it  well,  and  commu-
nicate  clearly  the  issues,  risks  and  conclusions.  I  think  it  is  likely  that  the  science
will  put  some  issues  to  bed  instead  of  letting  them  fester  without  resolution  for
years.  The  public  deserve  this  transparency,  and  responsible  environmental  stew-
ardship  dictates  that  we  should  understand  the  environmental  consequences  of  in-
dustrial processes (and negligence) and assess risks properly in order to decide how
best to find credible solutions to these issues.

Summary of current community concerns

The  following  is  a  letter  with  concerns  of  the  community  submitted  to  ATSDR
arising  from  the  Health  Consultation.  It  is  my  impression  that  most  if  not  all  of
these  concerns  are  still  current  because  they  were  not  addressed  in  the  report  or
in  any  follow-up  actions.  I  have  relied  on  Anne  Rabe  of  the  Community  Concerned
with National Lead for this input.

BIOGRAPHY FOR RANDALL R. PARRISH

American  by  birth  (in  1952),  the  son  of  parents  in  the  medical  business,  I  lived
in  the  U.S.  for  all  of  my  youth  (Oklahoma,  Colorado,  Arizona,  Vermont).  My  geo-
science  career  began  at  Middlebury  College  (Vermont)  during  my  BA  degree  study-
ing  Geology.  I  opted  to  undertake  graduate  degrees  in  Canada  at  the  University  of
British Columbia to study with the late R.L. Armstrong, a most insightful geologist
and  isotope  geochemist.  During  the  period  1974–83  I  undertook  field  work  and  re-
search in the western Cordillera of Canada (British Columbia mainly) where I com-
bined  field  work  in  tectonics  with  laboratory  and  theoretical  work  in  the  university
environment,  with  a  spell  teaching  at  a  community  college  in  southern  British  Co-
lumbia. I did my Ph.D. thesis on the rise of the Coast Mountains of British Colum-
bia,  which  involved  a  lot  of  hard  field  work  in  remote  places.  I  fortunately  escaped
any  dangerous  incidents  with  bears,  rivers,  aircraft  crashes  and  so  forth  that  are
known in this profession. My first substantial real job was at the Geological Survey
of  Canada  in  Ottawa  where  I  was  employed  from  1983–1996  extending  my  work
that combined geochronology (the dating of rocks and minerals to work out geologi-
cal  history)  and  field  and  tectonic  studies  (in  western  Cordillera  of  Canada,  much
of Canada’s vast Precambrian Shield, Saskatchewan, NW Territories, Baffin island,
Northern  Quebec,  Ontario  and  Quebec,  Yukon  Territories,  but  also  other  studies  in
the  U.S.,  &  Nepalese  Himalaya).  I  also  supervised  research  at  Carleton  University
Ottawa  in  geoscience.  My  work  in  Canada  is  best  known  for  the  tectonic  research
in  British  Columbia  and 
innovations  to  mass  spectrometry  and
geochronology  methods  that  I  and  my  colleague  the  late  J.  Chris  Roddick  were
largely  responsible  for,  including  the  synthesis  of  rare  isotopes  for  geochronology
(205Pb).

for  the 

With  the  downturn  in  fiscal  climate  in  Canada  in  the  mid-1990s  that  required
major  down-sizing  of  the  public  service,  I  managed  change  there  as  Head  of  the
Geochronology Research Facility, but subsequently in 1996 moved to Britain to lead
the Natural Environment Research Council’s Isotope Geoscience Laboratory, co-sited
at  the  British  Geological  Survey  in  Nottinghamshire  in  a  cross  appointment  ar-
rangement  through  the  University  of  Leicester,  my  main  employer.  This  is  still  my
current  position.  In  this  capacity  I  have  shouldered  a  range  of  responsibilities  in-
cluding  re-structuring  of  the  facility,  renewing  its  scientific  program  and  its  liaison
with  the  UK  geoscience  academic  community,  raising  funding  for  staff  growth,  pro-
gram growth, and instrumentation upgrading and expansion (we have 13 mass spec-
trometers  and  equipment  worth  about  £6M).  Our  facility  is  not  a  research  ‘empire’
but  a  collaborative  research  facility  that  scientists  all  over  the  UK  can  access—we
therefore know how to cooperate and collaborate effectively. Every five years we get
put  through  a  very  rigorous  funding  review;  each  time  our  performance  has  im-
proved  with  the  facility  now  being  very  stable  and  well  funded.  I  do  a  lot  of  Ph.D.
student  training  both  in  the  field  and  laboratory  environment  as  part  of  our  remit.
My  responsibilities  expanded  in  the  UK  to  include  a  diversified  research  portfolio
extending well beyond traditional geology and geochronology to include heavy metal
pollution, different methods of geochronology, innovating methods of analysis in geo-
science  using  laser  ablation  ICP–MS  techniques,  climate  change,  provision  of  solu-
tions  made  to  a  very  high  calibration  standard  to  worldwide  laboratories  for  inter-
laboratory  comparisons,  and  lately,  applying  my  analytical  and  scientific  expertise
to  issues  of  depleted  uranium  and  health,  and  the  screening  of  veterans  for  expo-
sure.  I  applied  my  skills  to  working  out  a  method  to  detect  DU  in  urine  following
an exposure more than 20 years prior; this was a major improvement to prior meth-
ods. Once I began the depleted uranium and health work, I have tried to make good
measurements the cornerstone of the science, let the direction of the work be guided
by  advances  and  insights  gained  through  those  results,  and  to  follow  the  science  of
DU  and  health  until  I  become  satisfied  that  I  have  done  all  that  I  could  to  provide
insight.  This  has  put  me  on  variable  sides  of  the  shifting  political  fence,  with  the
testimony of this hearing being an interesting collateral task.

I  hold  research  grants  in  the  UK  to  study  a  wide  variety  of  problems,  mainly  in-
volving the evolution of the geology and landscape in the eastern Himalaya, and in
improved  calibration  of  the  geological  time  scale  through  a  joint  NIGL–MIT–NSF
project called EarthTime. My DU research has been funded through piecemeal small
grants and contracts, and a funded Ph.D. studentship. I coordinate the thematic re-
search  program  of  the  Natural  Environment  Research  Council  concerned  with  de-
pleted  uranium  and  will  write  a  major  review  report  on  this  topic  this  year.  Our
largest contract in the DU business was that to measure uranium isotopes in urine
for the Depleted Uranium Oversight Board and we played a part in that major gov-
ernment  program  funded  by  the  Ministry  of  Defense.  That  program  was  aimed  to-
wards the military’s duty of care to UK military veterans.

I have led our national facility and worked with its talented staff to move the fa-
cility  to  considerable  prominence  as  an  environmental  science  isotope  facility  of
international  stature  where  a  number  of  research  areas  are  on  par  with  the  best
world  labs.  These  include  the  DU  work,  high  precision  U–Pb  geochronology,  laser
ablation  in  situ  U–Pb  geochronology,  multi-element  isotope  analysis  in  support  of
climate research in the recent geological record, and silicon isotope analysis.

In the past five years, I have increasingly been involved with grant proposal adju-
dication  in  the  UK  and  elsewhere,  editorial  duties,  and  undertaking  strategic  re-
views  of  facilities,  management  and  operation  of  portions  of  large  research  centers
within  the  UK,  including  my  host  institution  the  British  Geological  Survey.  I  con-
sider  myself  a  very  good  scientific  leader  and  manager  gained  through  experience
with colleagues during employment, and guided by common sense. Unusually, I con-
tinue  to  maintain  an  active  role  in  research  and  innovative  analytical  duties;  this
has extended my period of credibility as a scientist, thankfully!

Chair  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Professor  Parrish.  Your  use  of  the
phrase ‘‘immoral and perverse’’ made me feel better about perhaps
my  opening  statement  being  a  bit  harsh,  and  I  do  want  to  thank
you  for  coming  a  considerable  distance  to  come  to  this  hearing
today.

Dr. PARRISH. It was my pleasure.
Chair  MILLER.  We  have  been  joined  by  the  Ranking  Member  of
the  Full  Committee,  Mr.  Hall.  Mr.  Hall,  do  you  have  any  state-
ment?

Mr.  HALL.  Chair  Miller,  thank  you  for  having  this  hearing  and
bringing these men before us here. I was particularly interested in
Sal  Mier’s  testimony,  his  long-time  service  at  the  Centers  for  Dis-
ease  Control.  I  listened  to  him,  and  you  are  welcome  to  come  by
my  office,  and  I  thank  Dr.  Broun.  I  appreciate  it.  I  don’t  have  any
questions because I don’t know what other questions you will have,
but I will try to get back here and listen to one of the other panels,
but I thank you very much.

Chair  MILLER.  Thank  you.  You  don’t  represent  Midlothian,  do

know where you are going to be.

Chair MILLER. Mr. Hall covering all bets.

STATEMENT OF MR. JEFFREY C. CAMPLIN, PRESIDENT,

CAMPLIN ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.

Mr.  CAMPLIN.  Good  morning.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Sub-
committee  Members  and  staff  for  holding  such  an  important  hear-
ing on the lax behavior and misuse of science by ATSDR leadership
and  staff.  My  name  is  Jeffery  Camplin  and  I  am  President  of
Camplin  Environmental  Services  Inc.,  a  safety  and  environmental
consulting  firm  based  in  Rosemont,  Illinois.  My  chosen  research
specialty  is  asbestos.  I  have  been  a  volunteer  for  the  Illinois
Dunesland  Preservation  Society  since  2003  investigating  why
ATSDR  purposely  downplays  the  chronic  asbestos  exposure  of  mil-
lions of Illinois citizens each year.

My  story  begins  in  1993  when  I  brought  my  wife  and  three  kids
to  Illinois  Beach  State  Park  located  on  the  Illinois  Lake  Michigan
shoreline  north  of  Chicago.  After  building  sandcastles  and  burying
each  other  in  the  sand,  I  heard  my  wife  exclaim  ‘‘Look  in  the  car.
It  is  full  of  sand.  It  is  in  the  kids’  hair,  it  is  in  their  ears,  it  is  in

234

their  shoes,  it  is  everywhere.’’  Sand  eventually  ended  up  in  our
laundry  room  as  well.  Little  did  I  know  at  the  time  that  my  wife
along  with  millions  of  other  families  should  have  been  saying,
‘‘Look  at  the  asbestos  contamination  from  the  beaches.  It  is  in  our
car, it is on our kids, it is in our home.’’

I have been working for the last six years with Mr. Paul Kakuris,
President  of  the  Illinois  Dunesland  Preservation  Society.  Our  re-
search  indicates  that  ATSDR  has  violated  its  mission  to  serve  the
public  by  purposely  not  using  valid  science,  by  not  taking  respon-
sive  public  health  actions  and  by  providing  untrustworthy  health
information. Specifically, ATSDR has become a complacent agency,
choosing  to  produce  outdated,  inferior  work  products  when  they
know  more-valid  science  exists.  When  ATSDR’s  ethics  and  com-
petence  are  challenged,  a  great  wall  of  arrogance  and  denial  ap-
pears from their leadership to strenuously fend off requests for ac-
countability. ATSDR also takes advantage of the public’s gullibility
to  trust  an  agency  that  is  ethically  bankrupt.  The  egotistical  lead-
ership  and  complacent  culture  at  this  once  great  agency  needs  a
total overhaul. However, that is not enough.

We are here today to demand accountability for the harm caused
to  public  health  by  inexcusable  and  deliberate  behavior  of  ATSDR
staff  in  downplaying  elevated  levels  of  toxic  microscopic  asbestos
along  the  entire  Illinois  Lake  Michigan  shoreline.  Evidence  dem-
onstrates  that  U.S.  EPA  and  the  State  of  Illinois  along  with
ATSDR  bungled  the  cleanup  of  an  asbestos  Superfund  site  at  the
south end of Illinois Beach State Park, allowing trillions of asbestos
fibers to be released from an unfiltered pipe into Lake Michigan to
this very day. Their incompetence also allowed large areas of asbes-
tos-contaminated lake sediments to be dredged and dumped on and
offshore at heavily visited public beaches. Federal agencies and the
State of Illinois then generated rigged data to conclude the massive
asbestos contamination they created was not hazardous to the mil-
lions of citizens who frequent these areas. Illinois is well known for
nurturing  a  culture  of  public  officials  with  less  than  honest  and
ethical behavior. Illinois citizens seized upon the opportunity—I am
sorry—Illinois  officials  seized  upon  the  opportunity  presented  by
the complacent culture at ATSDR to protect their unethically sym-
biotic agendas. They obtained rubber-stamped approval of their in-
tentionally flawed federal and State reports.

In  order  to  conceal  the  unethical  behavior  of  their  staff,  ATSDR
will  tell  you  the  science  is  still  developing  while  they  knowingly
continue  to  use  severely  flawed  and  outdated  asbestos  risk  assess-
ments.  What  they  don’t  tell  you  is,  the  current  science  completely
discredits  and  invalidates  all  of  their  past  asbestos  human  health
evaluations in Illinois as well as hundreds of other sites throughout
the Nation. ATSDR stubbornly refuses to acknowledge this fact.

Just  this  week  ATSDR  arrogantly  issued  another  health  con-
sultation  which  intentionally  fails  to  warn  the  public  about  deadly
microscopic  amphibole  minerals  they  found  in  beach  sand  and  air.
Instead,  ATSDR  recklessly  continues  to  invite  families  to  a  shore-
line chronically contaminated with asbestos, that is, as long as they
don’t touch the visible pieces of debris during their visit. Yet there
is  no  recommendation  to  the  public  regarding  the  microscopic  as-
bestos  that  gets  on  our  kids,  gets  in  our  cars,  gets  in  our  homes

and  ultimately  enters  our  lungs.  Maybe  Dr.  Frumkin  can  explain
his  staff’s  findings  that  deceitfully  concealed  the  hazard  from  the
public.

Another  example  of  ATSDR’s  indiscretion  includes  the  review  of
one of their beach asbestos results in 2006 that the EPA identified
as potentially harmful to health. ATSDR dismissed the criticism by
the U.S. EPA, stating the beaches were safe anyway.

The  fraudulent  findings  of  ATSDR  create  a  welcome  permission
slip  for  the  continuing  dredging  of  toxic  asbestos-contaminated
sand  in  Illinois.  Spreading  the  contaminated  dredge  material  on
the  shoreline  increases  the  risk  of  mesothelioma  cancer  rates  in
Lake  and  Cook  counties  along  Lake  Michigan  that  already  have
elevated  mesothelioma  rates  when  compared  to  national  averages.
How  high  must  the  body  count  get  before  ATSDR  admits  there  is
a problem?

In 2004, then-Illinois State Senator Barack Obama best summed
up  our  feelings  when  asked  by  a  reporter  about  the  asbestos  con-
tamination  along  the  Illinois  shoreline.  Our  current  President  said
at  the  time,  we  can’t  have  our  kids  swimming  in  areas  that  might
be contaminated with asbestos, and then he stated they should con-
sider shutting down the asbestos-contaminated shoreline.

Precautionary  protections  are  necessary  to  address  the  con-
tinuing  public  health  disaster  and  egregious  violations  of  public
trust  from  getting  any  worse.  The  first  step  is  for  ATSDR  to  ac-
knowledge their past studies are flawed. Next, limit the public’s ex-
posure to asbestos-laden shoreline beaches until scientifically valid
exposure  assessments  can  be  completed  in  an  open,  inclusive  and
transparent  manner.  The  final  step  is  to  hold  all  parties  liable  for
their  actions.  ATSDR  officials  Mark  Johnson,  Jim  Durant,  John
Wheeler and Howard Frumkin along with State of Illinois and U.S.
EPA  officials  must  be  held  accountable  for  their  egregious  and  po-
tentially  criminal  behavior  that  resulted  in  millions  of  innocent
families being unwittingly exposed to deadly amphibole fibers.

On behalf of the Illinois Dunesland Preservation Society and the

citizens of Illinois, I want to thank you for this hearing.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Camplin follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEFFERY C. CAMPLIN

Good  morning.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Subcommittee  Members  and,  staff  for
holding  such  an  important  hearing  on  the  lax  behavior  and  misuse  of  science  by
ATSDR/CDC leadership and staff. My name is Jeffery Camplin, and I am President
of  Camplin  Environmental  Services,  Inc.,  a  safety  and  environmental  consulting
firm  based  in  Rosemont,  Illinois.  My  chosen  research  specialty  is  asbestos.  I  have
been  a  volunteer  for  the  Illinois  Dunesland  Preservation  Society  since  2003,  inves-
tigating why ATSDR purposefully downplays the chronic asbestos exposures of mil-
lions of Illinois citizens each year.

My story begins in 1993 when I brought my wife and three children (two to three
years old) to Illinois Beach State Park, located on the Illinois Lake Michigan shore-
line  north  of  Chicago.  After  building  sand  castles  and  burying  each  other  in  the
sand  I  heard  my  wife  exclaim,  ‘‘Look  in  the  car,  it’s  full  of  sand.  It’s  in  the  kids’
hair,  in  their  ears,  and  in  their  shoes  . . .  it’s  everywhere.’’  Sand  eventually  ended

not  taking  responsive  public  health  actions,  and  by  providing  untrustworthy  health
information. Specifically:

• ATSDR has become a complacent agency, choosing to produce outdated, infe-

rior work products when they know that more valid science exists.

• When  ATSDR’s  ethics  and  competence  are  challenged,  a  great  wall  of  arro-
gance  and  denials  appears  from  their  leadership  to  strenuously  fend  off  re-
quests for accountability.

• ATSDR  also  takes  advantage  of  the  public’s  gullibility  to  trust  in  an  Agency

that is ethically bankrupt.

The  egotistical  leadership  and  complacent  cultured  this  once  great  agency  needs
a total overhaul. However, that is not enough: We are here today to demand ac-
countability  for  the  harm  caused  to  public  health  by  the  inexcusable  and
deliberate behavior of ATSDR staff in downplaying elevated levels of toxic
microscopic asbestos along the entire Illinois Lake Michigan shoreline.

Evidence  demonstrates  the  USEPA  and  the  State  of  Illinois,  along  with  ATSDR,
bungled the cleanup of an asbestos Superfund site at the south end of Illinois Beach
State  Park,  allowing  trillions  of  asbestos  fibers  to  be  released  from  an  unfiltered
pipe  into  Lake  Michigan  to  this  very  day.  Their  incompetency  also  allowed  large
areas  of  asbestos-contaminated  lake  sediments  to  be  dredged  and  dumped  on  and
off shore at heavily visited public beaches. Federal agencies and the State of Illinois
then  generated  rigged  data  to  conclude  the  massive  asbestos-contamination  they
created was not hazardous to the millions of citizens who frequent these areas. Illi-
nois  is  well  known  for  nurturing  a  culture  of  public  officials  with  less  than  honest
and  ethical  behavior.  Illinois  officials  seized  upon  the  opportunity  presented  by  the
complacent  culture  at  ATSDR  to  protect  their  unethically  symbiotic  agendas.  They
obtained  ‘‘rubber  stamped’’  approval  of  their  intentionally  flawed  federal  and  State
reports.

In order to conceal the unethical behavior of their staff, ATSDR will tell you that
‘‘the science is still developing’’ while they knowingly continue to use severely flawed
and  outdated  asbestos  risk  assessment  methods.  What  they  don’t  tell  you  is  that
current  science  completely  discredits  and  invalidates  ALL  of  their  past  asbestos
human health evaluations in Illinois and at hundreds of others sites throughout the
Nation. Yet, ATSDR stubbornly refuses to acknowledge this fact.

Just  this  week,  ATSDR  has  arrogantly  issued  another  ‘‘Health  Consultation’’
which intentionally fails to warn the public about the deadly microscopic amphibole
mineral  fibers  they  found  in  beach  sand  and  air.  Instead,  ATSDR’s  recklessly  con-
tinues  to  invite  families  to  a  shoreline  chronically  contaminated  with  asbestos  . . .
that is as long as they don’t touch the visible pieces of asbestos debris during their
visit. Yet there is no recommendation to the public regarding the microscopic asbes-
tos  that  get  on  our  kids,  get  in  our  car,  get  in  our  homes,  and  ultimately  enters
our  lungs.  Maybe  Dr.  Frumkin  can  explain  his  staff’s  findings  that  deceitfully  con-
ceal this hazard from the public.

Examples of other indiscretions by ATSDR include:

1. ATSDR  generated  beach  asbestos  exposure  results  in  2006  that  the  USEPA
identified  as  potentially  harmful  to  human  health.  ATSDR  dismissed  the
criticism  by  the  USEPA  along  with  our  ethics  violation  charges  and  pub-
lished the report stating the beaches were safe anyway.

2. In over a decade of testing, ATSDR has never performed or reviewed any air
sampling  data  that  was  obtained  during  the  hot,  dry,  dusty  months  of  June
through  mid-August.  They  intentionally  test  outside  the  beach  season  when
the beaches are damp and cooler.

3. ATSDR  found  no  elevated  risk  to  human  health  from  the  rare  but  virulent
asbestos  fiber  called  tremolite  found  on  Chicago’s  Oak  Street  Beach.
Tremolite  asbestos-contamination  has  already  devastated  the  town  of  Libby,
Montana  with  one  of  the  highest  mesothelioma  cancer  rates  in  the  Nation.
The fraudulent findings of ATSDR created a welcome permission slip for the con-
tinued  dredging  of  toxic  asbestos  contaminated  sand  in  Illinois.  Spreading  the  con-
taminated dredge material on the shoreline increases the risk of mesothelioma can-
cer rates in Lake and Cook counties along Lake Michigan that are already elevated
when  compared  to  the  national  average.  How  high  must  the  body  count  get  before
ATSDR admits there is a problem?

In 2004, then Illinois State Senator Barrack Obama best summed up our feelings
when asked by a reporter about the asbestos contamination along the Illinois shore-
line:  Our  current  President  said  at  the  time,  ‘‘We  can’t  have  our  kids  swimming  in

scientifically  valid  exposure  assessments  can  be  completed  in  an  open,  inclu-
sive, and transparent manner.
• The  final  step  is  to  hold  all  parties  liable  for  their  actions.  ATSDR  officials
(Mark  Johnson,  Jim  Durant,  John  Wheeler,  and  Howard  Frumkin),  along
with  State  of  Illinois  and  USEPA  officials  must  be  held  accountable  for  their
egregious  and  potentially  criminal  behavior  that  has  resulted  in  millions  of
innocent  families  being  unwittingly  exposed  to  deadly  amphibole  asbestos  fi-
bers.

On  behalf  of  the  Illinois  Dunesland  Preservation  Society  and  the  citizens  of  Illi-

nois, I want to thank you for this opportunity.

I will now address any questions you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JEFFERY C. CAMPLIN

Since  1991,  Jeff  has  been  President  of  Camplin  Environmental  Services,  Inc.  He
is  a  Certified  Safety  Professional  (CSP)  and  Certified  Professional  Environmental
Auditor (CPEA). He has been a licensed asbestos professional in the State of Illinois
since 1986. Jeff is a nationally recognized safety and health expert who is an accom-
plished author and public speaker. Jeff has been an instructor of USEPA accredited
asbestos abatement training courses for over 20 years.

In  2003,  Mr.  Camplin  became  a  non-paid  consultant  for  the  Illinois  Dunesland
Preservation  Society  involved  with  evaluating  issues  related  to  the  presence  of  sta-
tistically elevated levels of visible and microscopic asbestos and other amphibole as-
bestos  fibers  present  in  beach  sand  along  the  Illinois  Lake  Michigan  shoreline.  He
determined  that  asbestos  public  health  assessments  published  by  ATSDR  in  2000
and 2006 were not based upon scientifically valid data. Mr. Camplin has challenged
several of these ATSDR studies without receiving credible responses from the Agen-
cy.

Mr.  Camplin  has  uncovered  evidence  of  ATSDR  staff  rigging  asbestos  studies  by
manipulating  sampling  protocol,  analytical  methods,  and  risk  models  used  in  their
studies.  Examples  of  this  rigging  includes  sampling  during  and  immediately  after
rain  events,  using  larger  pore  sized  filter  media  in  violation  of  standard  protocols,
and  avoiding  air  sample  testing  during  the  hot,  dry,  beach  season  of  June  through
mid-August. He also caught ATSDR staff on video violating ethical standards by ex-
posing the unprotected public to high levels of asbestos fibers during ATSDR’s activ-
ity-based asbestos testing on public beaches. These findings not only discredit health
evaluations performed at Illinois Beach State Park and Oak Street Beach (Chicago),
but  also  hundreds  of  other  asbestos  health  evaluations  performed  by  ATSDR
throughout the United States using the same flawed and unscientifically sound pro-
tocols.

Mr. Camplin has been interviewed by the USEPA’s Inspector General’s Office who
is currently completing a nearly two-year investigation into the asbestos contamina-
tion  issues  along  the  Illinois  Lake  Michigan  shoreline.  The  investigation  focuses  on
the manipulation and rigging of studies by the State of Illinois, USEPA, and ATSDR
to fraudulently conclude that the statistically elevated levels of microscopic asbestos
fibers present in beach sand is safe for the public to disturb. He seeks to have prop-
er scientifically supported studies performed in the future in an open, publicly inclu-
sive,  transparent  manner,  with  independent  third  party  peer  review.  Mr.  Camplin
and  the  Illinois  Dunesland  Preservation  Society  also  seek  to  have  those  members
of ATSDR held accountable for their egregious ethical and professional conduct vio-
lations  during  their  manipulation  of  data  in  the  creation  of  scientifically  unsound
human health studies.

Chair MILLER. My opening statement seems more and more tem-

perate.

Dr. Hoffman.

STATEMENT OF DR. RONALD HOFFMAN, ALBERT A. AND VERA
G.  LIST  PROFESSOR  OF  MEDICINE,  MOUNT  SINAI  SCHOOL
OF  MEDICINE;  DIRECTOR,  MYELOPROLIFERATIVE  DIS-
ORDERS  PROGRAM,  TISCH  CANCER  INSTITUTE,  MOUNT
SINAI MEDICAL CENTER
Dr. HOFFMAN. Thank you. For the last 30 years my research and
clinical  practice  have  revolved  around  the  investigation  of  a  group
of  chronic  blood  disorders  termed  myeloproliferative  disorders,
which  include  polycythemia  vera,  essential  thrombocythemia  and
primary myelofibrosis. These are serious disorders characterized by
excessive production of red cells, platelets and white blood cells and
are  associated  with  excessive  blood  clotting,  bleeding  and  eventual
evolution to acute leukemia.

In 2005, a mutation in an intracellular kinase termed JAK2 was
found  to  be  present  in  patients  with  myeloproliferative  disorders
and was shown to play a role in the development of this particular
group  of  disorders.  The  mutation  allows  blood  cell  production  to
occur  in  myeloproliferative  disorders  in  the  absence  of  signals  pro-

vided by hormones that normally control blood cell production lead-
ing to the production of too many red cells, white cells or platelets
in patients with this disorder. Most importantly for this discussion,
the  JAK2V617F  mutation  has  been  shown  to  provide  an  almost
foolproof means of diagnosing patients with myeloproliferative neo-
plasms,  since  it  can  be  detected  using  molecular  methods  in  over
95  percent  of  patients  with  polycythemia  vera.  Since  there  are  nu-
merous  other  causes  of  too  many  red  cells  or  polycythemia  other
than this form of blood cancer, physicians frequently had great dif-
ficulty  in  making  this  diagnosis.  With  the  advent  of  the  molecular
test  for  JAK2V617F,  the  accuracy  of  definitively  diagnosing  this
disorder  has  been  greatly  elevated.  Although  blood  cells  with
JAK2V617F are occasionally observed in patients with other kinds
of blood cancers, it is rarely, if ever, observed in normal people.

My  first  contact  with  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Dis-
ease Registry began in the summer of 2006. Dr. Vince Seaman, an
epidemiologist and toxicologist at ATSDR, first called me to ask me
some  questions  about  the  nature  of  polycythemia  vera  and  about
the  possibility  of  environmental  insults  increasing  the  incidence  of
this blood cancer. I was a bit skeptical about the significance of this
polycythemia vera cluster that Dr. Seaman and his colleagues were
then  investigating  in  Carbon,  Luzerne  and  Schuylkill  counts  in
eastern  Pennsylvania  in  response  to  an  invitation  made  by  the
Pennsylvania Department of Public Health. After a series of phone
calls  with  Dr.  Seaman,  I  gained  a  greater  degree  of  comfort  with
these  investigations,  that  this  cluster  was  potentially  important
from a scientific point of view and that it presented a possible pub-
lic  health  danger  to  the  citizens  of  the  State  of  Pennsylvania.  In
the  past,  links  between  environmental  exposures  and  clusters  of
polycythemia  vera  have  not  been  well  documented.  In  my  discus-
sions  with  Dr.  Seaman,  I  emphasized  the  difficulty  of  making  the
clinical  diagnosis  of  polycythemia  vera  and  that  the  newly  de-
scribed molecular assay would provide a simple, inexpensive means
of  making  this  diagnosis  with  certainty  merely  by  testing  blood
drawn from the study subjects. Dr. Seaman agreed and we set out
to  create  a  means  of  obtaining  blood  specimens  for  subjects  who
agreed to participate in the study. We proceeded with the JAK2V61
testing due to my belief that these studies were the state-of-the-art
in  2009,  although  there  was  initial  pushback  on  the  part  of  the
Agency  and  I  felt  that  it  was  important  to  do  this  test  to  confirm
the diagnosis of polycythemia vera. By the end of 2007, these anal-
yses had been completed showing that about 53 percent of the sub-
jects  in  this  study  area  fulfilled  both  clinical  and  molecular  diag-
nostic  criteria  of  having  this  hematologic  cancer.  One  patient  had
diagnostic  features  of  polycythemia  as  determined  by  a  committee
of  experts  but  did  not  have  the  JAK2  mutation.  The  confirmed
cases  appeared  to  be  clustered  around  numerous  EPA  Superfund
sites  and  sites  of  waste  coal  power  plants  in  the  tri-county  area.
Remarkably,  to  me,  at  least,  four  of  the  reported  cases  of  poly-
cythemia  vera  were  located  along  Ben  Titus  Road,  a  stretch  of
about  100  homes  scattered  along  a  two-mile  stretch.  Each  of  these
cases  were  confirmed  to  be  JAK2V617F  positive  and  therefore  to
indeed  have  polycythemia  vera.  Remarkably,  the  greatest  number
of cases of polycythemia vera were in the Tamaqua area, a sparsely

populated  area  not  in  the  area  of  greatest  population  near  Wilkes-
Barre.

With  this  data  in  hand,  I  and  Dr.  Seaman  wrote  an  abstract  in
August 2007 for consideration for presentation at the 2007 meeting
of the American Society of Hematology to be held, ironically, in At-
lanta,  Georgia,  in  December.  Several  conference  calls  were  held
with numerous members of the ATSDR staff who checked the data
and went over the content of the abstract word by word and agreed
with  the  data  and  conclusions  of  the  abstract  vocally  during  these
numerous conversations. The abstract——

Chair MILLER. Dr. Hoffman, there is a five-minute limitation. We
are reasonably generous with it. Your whole written statement will
be  part  of  the  record.  Could  you  summarize  in  perhaps  a  para-
graph?

Dr. HOFFMAN. Sure. The abstract eventually was accepted by the
Society  in  November  of  that  year  and  it  was  accepted  as  an  oral
presentation.  I  then  went  on  to  create  this  presentation  that  was
presented before the Society in December of 2007. A representative
of the Agency management team was to appear at the presentation
but  at  the  last  moment,  although  he  was  based  in  Atlanta,  he  re-
fused  to  attend  or  wasn’t  able  to  attend.  Several  days  prior  to  my
presentation  at  Atlanta,  the  ATSDR  unbeknownst  to  me  issued  a
press  release  stating  that  the  abstract  presented  results  that  were
premature and scientifically flawed. Medical colleagues in Hazleton
called  me  to  inform  me  of  this  disclaimer  because  reports  had  ap-
peared  in  the  local  press.  I  was  of  course  shocked  and  was  incred-
ulous  about  the  lack  of  forthrightness  demonstrated  to  me  by  my
presumed  collaborators  at  ATSDR.  After  my  arrival  in  Atlanta  I
was  contacted  on  my  cell  phone  on  repeated  occasions  by  officials
at  ATSDR  requesting  that  I  either  withdraw  the  abstract  entirely,
state  prior  to  my  presentation  that  the  Agency  disagreed  with  my
conclusions or present an abridged version of the data. I presented
the  abstract  in  its  entirety  and  it  was  well  accepted  by  the  audi-
ence at the American Society of Hematology. In order to obtain fur-
ther  peer  review,  we  then  went  about  upon  Dr.  Seaman’s  return
from a trip to Mozambique on ATSDR business to submit this pub-
lication  to  a  peer-review  journal.  Prior  to  that  submission,  the
Agency  insisted  of  Dr.  Seaman  and  myself  to  perform  further
geospatial  analyses  which  to  a  statistical  point  of  view  confirmed
the  findings  that  were  present  in  our  abstract  showing  that  there
was  a  higher  incidence  of  polycythemia  vera  in  this  area  and  that
those cases were essentially around these areas of high toxic expo-
sure.

From  my  point  of  view,  the  mission  of  the  Agency  is  to  generate
and communicate credible scientific information about the relation-
ship  between  hazardous  substances  and  adverse  events  that  affect
human health and to promote responsive public health actions. My
experience  was  that  in  the  case  of  polycythemia  vera  in  eastern
Pennsylvania was that the ATSDR did not accomplish this goal but
only  accomplished  it  eventually  with  relentless  prodding  to  com-
plete  the  needed  investigations.  My  sense  was  that  if  the  Agency
was  left  to  themselves,  they  would  have  preferred  to  ignore  the
whole  problem.  ATSDR  seemed  to  be  committed  to  a  course  of  ig-
noring  and  discrediting  a  mounting  body  of  evidence  which  sug-

gested  the  presence  of  a  cluster  of  polycythemia  vera  patients  in
this  tri-county  area.  With  the  full  publication  of  our  paper  in  Feb-
ruary of 2009, the Agency really I think greatly turned around and
began to become much more serious about these investigations and
hopefully  in  the  future  we  will  be  able  to  expand  this  area,  which
I think is of great interest. Thank you for your time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RONALD HOFFMAN

My  name  is  Dr.  Ronald  Hoffman.  I  am  the  Albert  A.  and  Vera  G.  List  Professor
of  Medicine  at  the  Tisch  Cancer  Institute  of  the  Mount  Sinai  School  of  Medicine  in
New York, NY. At that institution I am Director of the Myeloproliferative Disorders
Program.  For  over  31  years  I  have  been  a  practicing  clinical  hematologist.  Hema-
tology is the study of the diseases of the blood. In addition, I am a laboratory based
scientist who has investigated the stem cell origins of blood cancers. I am an author
of  over  400  scientific  papers  and  have  served  as  the  President  of  both  the  Inter-
national  Society  of  Experimental  Hematology  and  the  American  Society  of  Hema-
tology.  I  am  the  lead  editor  of  the  textbook  Hematology,  Basic  Principles  and  Prac-
tice,  which  is  in  its  5th  edition  and  is  the  leading  textbook  of  hematology  in  the
United  States  and  Europe.  I  have  held  prior  faculty  positions  at  Yale  University

to  occur 

For  the  last  30  years  my  research  and  clinical  practice  has  revolved  around  the
investigation of a group of chronic blood cancers, termed the myeloproliferative dis-
orders  with  include  polycythemia  vera,  essential  thrombocythemia  and  primary
myelofibrosis. These disorders are characterized by excessive production of red cells,
platelets and white blood cells. These disorders are frequently associated with exces-
sive blood clotting or bleeding and evolution to acute leukemia. These disorders are
now  known  to  be  blood  cancers  which  originate  at  the  level  of  blood  stem  cells.  In
2005  a  mutation  of  an  intracellular  kinase  termed  JAK2  was  found  to  be  present
in  patients  with  myeloproliferative  disorders.  JAK2  is  responsible  for  transmitting
signals  to  blood  cell  elements  inducing  them  to  produce  greater  numbers  of  such
cells  in  response  to  hormones  that  normally  regulate  blood  cell  production.  The
JAK2  mutation  was  discovered  by  a  group  in  France  headed  by  Dr.  William
Vainchenker.  The  mutation  allows  blood 
in
myeloproliferative  disorder  marrow  cells  in  the  absence  of  the  signals  provided  by
the hormones that normally control blood cell production, thereby leading to the pro-
duction  of  too  many  red  cells,  white  cells  or  platelets  in  patients  with  these  blood
cancers. This JAK2V627F mutation also been shown to provide an almost fool proof
means  of  diagnosing  patients  with  myeloproliferative  neoplasms  since  it  can  be  de-
tected  using  molecular  methods  in  over  95  percent  of  patients  with  polycythemia
vera,  and  50  percent  of  patients  with  essential  thrombocythemia  and  primary
myelofibrosis. Previously, polycythemia vera was diagnosed based upon a variety of
costly diagnostic tests as well as relatively nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms.
Since  there  are  numerous  other  causes  of  too  many  red  cells  or  polycythemia  other
than  this  form  of  blood  cancer,  physicians  frequently  had  great  difficulty  in  defini-
tively making this diagnosis. With the advent of the molecular test for JAK2V617F,
the  accuracy  of  definitively  diagnosing  polycythemia  vera  has  been  greatly  en-
hanced.  Although  blood  cells  with  the  JAK2V617F  are  occasionally  observed  in  pa-
tients  with  other  kinds  of  blood  cancers  it  is  rarely  if  ever  observed  in  normal  peo-
ple.

My  first  contact  with  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry
(ATSDR)  began  in  the  summer  in  2006.  Dr.  Vince  Seaman,  an  epidemiologist  and
toxicologist  at  ATSDR  first  called  me  to  ask  me  some  questions  about  the  nature
of  polycythemia  vera  and  about  the  possibility  of  environmental  insults  increasing
in  the  incidence  of  this  blood  cancer.  I  had  never  heard  of  the  ATSDR  and  at  that

sented  a  possible  public  health  danger  to  the  citizens  of  Pennsylvania.  In  the  past,
links between environmental toxic exposures and clusters of polycythemia vera had
not been well documented. In my discussions with Dr. Seaman I emphasized the dif-
ficulty of making the clinical diagnosis of polycythemia vera and that the newly de-
scribed  molecular  assay  for  JAK2V167F  would  provide  a  simple  inexpensive  means
of  making  this  diagnosis  with  certainty  merely  by  testing  blood  drawn  from  the
study subjects. Dr. Seaman agreed and we set about to create a means of obtaining
blood specimens from the subjects who agreed to participate in the study. Specimens
were  collected  in  Tamaqua,  shipped  to  my  laboratory  and  analyzed  for  JAK2V617F
during  the  period  from  December  2006  through  April  2007.  These  specimens  were
shipped  in  a  de-identified  manner  to  my  laboratory  and  the  assays  were  performed
without  knowledge  of  the  patient  source.  Initially  I  had  asked  that  ATSDR  to  pro-
vide some support to cover the expenses for the performance of these assays. To my
surprise  the  Agency  administrators  were  unwilling  to  supply  such  funds  and  were
actually  resistant  to  their  performance.  Their  unwillingness  to  receive  input  about
the  significance  of  the  extraordinarily  large  numbers  of  patients  with  this
hematological  cancer  in  this  small  area  of  Pennsylvania  or  to  consider  the  value  of
a  molecular  epidemiological  tool  to  make  their  task  easier  surprised  me.  Their  lack
of  comfort  in  collaborating  with  scientists  outside  their  community  or  their  area  of
expertise  and  to  readily  incorporate  new  scientific  advances  into  their  research  ef-
forts while investigating a possible cluster of blood cancer patterns seemed odd, and
closed minded in nature. I frequently felt that the members of the Agency manage-
ment  team  viewed  that  this  molecular  epidemiological  approach  was  overkill  and
unnecessary  since  they  had  already  concluded  that  the  cluster  was  not  significant
or worthy of further investigation. We proceeded with the JAK2V617F testing with-
out  the  support  of  the  Agency  due  to  my  belief  that  these  studies  were  the  state-
of-the-art  in  2009  and  were  required  to  confirm  the  diagnosis  of  polycythemia  vera
The molecular testing for JAK2V617F was supported with funds that I had received
from  the  Myeloproliferative  Disorders  Research  Foundation  for  different  purposes.
The Foundation agreed to this diversion of resources. Dr. Seaman and his team sent
us fifty six blood specimens which we evaluated for the JAK2V617F mutation. Over
half  of  these  specimens  were  JAK2V617F  positive  and  an  additional  five  patients
from  the  area  were  shown  to  be  JAK2V617F  positive  based  upon  information
present in their medical records; I also assisted ATSDR in establishing a committee
of  medical  experts  to  examine  the  medical  records  of  the  participants  in  the  study
be  certain  that  the  clinical  characteristics  of  these  individuals  were  consistent  with
a diagnosis of polycythemia vera.

By  the  end  of  April  2007  these  molecular  analyses  had  been  completed  showing
that  about  53  percent  of  the  subjects  in  the  study  area  fulfilled  both  clinical  and
molecular  diagnostic  criteria  of  having  polycythemia  vera.  One  patient  had  diag-
nostic features of polycythemia vera as determined by our committee of experts but
did  not  have  the  JAK2V617F  mutation  The  confirmed  cases  appeared  to  be  clus-
tered  around  the  EPA  superfund  sites  and  sites  of  waste  coal  power  plants  in  the
tri-county  area.  Remarkably,  four  of  the  reported  cases  of  polycythemia  vera  were
located  along  Ben  Titus  Road,  a  stretch  of  about  100  homes  scattered  over  a  dis-
tance of mile; each of these cases was confirmed as being JAK2V617F positive indi-
cating  that  these  patients  did  indeed  have  polycythemia  vera.  Remarkably,  the
greatest numbers of cases of polycythemia vera were in the Tamaqua area, a sparse-
ly populated area, not in the area of greatest population density near Wilkes-Barre
where  the  cancer  registry  data  (which  is  based  upon  diagnoses  being  made  using
clinical criteria) had indicated that the greatest numbers of patients had lived. With
this data in hand, I and Dr. Seaman wrote an abstract in August 2007 for consider-
ation  for  presentation  at  the  2007  meeting  of  The  American  Society  of  Hematology
Meeting  which  was  to  be  held  in  December  2007  in  Atlanta,  Georgia.  Over  20,000
hematologists  from  around  the  world  usually  attend  this  meeting.  Several  con-
ference  calls  were  held  with  numerous  members  of  the  ATSDR  staff  who  checked
the  data  and  went  over  the  content  of  the  abstract  word  by  word  and  agreed  with
the  data  and  the  conclusions  of  the  abstract  vocally  during  these  numerous  con-
versations  prior  to  its  submission.  The  abstract  was  then  submitted  for  consider-
ation for presentation at the American Society of Hematology Meeting. Although nu-
merous  ATSDR  staff  were  aware  of  this  submission  and  its  content,  Dr.  Seaman,
without my knowledge, apparently did not have the abstract formally cleared by the
Agency.  Dr.  Seaman  explained  to  me  that  he  was  new  at  the  Agency  and  was  not
fully  aware  of  the  clearance  process  for  documents  of  this  type.  This  omission  was
surprising  to  me  and  appeared  to  represent  a  technicality  since  so  many  of  the
ATSDR staff had gone over the content of this abstract and had already agreed with
its content during our numerous phone conversations. In October of 2007 I attended
a community meeting dealing with this subject which was organized by the ATSDR

and the Pennsylvania Department of Health in Hazelton, Pennsylvania. Prior to the
meeting  I  had  lunch  with  many  of  the  junior  staff  of  ATSDR  who  had  come  to
Hazelton.  My  collaborator  at  the  Agency,  Dr.  Vince  Seaman  was  noticeably  absent.
Several  weeks  prior  to  the  meeting  he  had  been  sent  to  Mozambique  for  a  manda-
tory training period dealing with agency business. I felt that the timing of Dr. Sea-
man’s  trip  was  odd  and  showed  poor  judgment  on  the  part  of  the  Agency.  Dr.  Sea-
man  had  participated  in  the  field  of  work  that  led  to  the  report  and  had  the  con-
fidence and trust of the community. Many of the community members saw Dr. Sea-
man  as  a  so  called  ‘‘straight  shooter.’’  At  the  lunch  many  of  the  junior  staff  of  the
ATSDR  bemoaned  Dr.  Seaman’s  absence,  but  were  energized  by  the  findings  that
had resulted from the collaboration between Dr. Seaman and my laboratory . About
75–100  community  members  attended  the  meeting  and  there  were  a  series  of  pres-
entations,  some  by  the  professionals  in  the  community,  by  ATSDR  senior  staff  and
by  myself.  The  conclusions  articulated  by  the  ATSDR  spokesperson  seemed  at  odds
with  the  results  summarized  in  our  abstract  that  had  just  been  submitted  to  the
American  Society  of  Hematology.  The  ATSDR  claimed  that  groups  of  polycythemia
vera  cases  were  scattered  throughout  the  tri-county  area  in  no  predictable  pattern.
They also emphasized that only half of the reported cases actually had polycythemia
vera  based  upon  our  molecular  analyses  but  failed  to  mention  that  even  with  this
caveat in mind that the incidence of polycythemia vera was still extraordinarily high
in  this  region.  ATSDR  appeared  to  minimize  the  importance  of  these  findings  and
concluded  that  it  would  be  virtually  impossible  to  identify  the  inciting  agent  that
might possibly have led to the polycythemia vera cluster. The ATSDR spokesperson
seemed  to  feel  that  this  was  a  fruitless  effort  and  was  not  really  worthy  of  further
attention.  I  was  impressed  by  the  anger  of  the  community  at  the  meeting,  there
sense  of  futility  and  betrayal.  At  the  meeting  I  mentioned  to  the  audience  that  we
have  submitted  an  abstract  to  the  American  Society  of  Hematology  about  our  find-
ings and that the scientific community would assess the validity of our conclusions.
I attempted to inform them that if this material was found scientifically meritorious
that  the  scientific  community  would  demand  further  investigation  of  the  problem.
They  appeared  skeptical.  As  I  drove  back  to  New  York  that  evening  with  my  sci-
entific colleague at Mount Sinai, Dr. Mingjiang Xu we talked about the experiences
of  the  day.  We  commented  how  we  felt,  that  the  ATSDR  had  misinterpreted  and
prematurely  drawn  conclusions  about  the  data  that  we  had  participated  in  gener-
ating.  We  commented  that  many  of  the  ATSDR  management  were  unwilling  to
think  out  of  the  box  and  how  their  unwillingness  to  investigate  the  unknown  or  to
address  difficult  problems  was  the  antithesis  to  the  type  of  scientific  investigation
that  we  were  so  familiar  with  in  the  biological  and  medical  sciences.  Also  we  ques-
tioned  if  there  was  some  outside  constituency  who  ATSDR  was  responding  to  that
made them act like they just wanted this whole matter to go away. Instead of view-
ing  this  as  a  challenging  and  important  scientific  problem  of  possible  importance,
we  felt  that  they  had  concluded  that  it  was  not  important  or  that  it  was  futile  to
try  to  further  investigate  its  origins..  Their  lack  of  familiarity  with  the  power  of
modern  cellular  and  molecular  biology  and  their  unwillingness  to  apply  these  tools
in an innovative fashion to this problem was surprising to me. I concluded that this
type of nihilism was antithetical to the performance of good science.

In the middle of November I was e-mailed by the American Society of Hematology
that our abstract had been accepted as an oral presentation. Only 12 percent of the
thousands of abstracts submitted to this meeting receive a high enough grade to be
presented  at  an  oral  session.  I  immediately  informed  Vince  Seaman  of  the  accept-
ance.  Vince  was  in  Mozambique  on  assignment  but  he  and  several  other  ATSDR
staff  members  helped  me  create  the  presentation  and  reviewed  its  content  and  re-
peatedly  altered  the  content  until  they  approved  it  and  the  written  speech  that  I
was  to  present  at  the  meeting.  There  were  repeated  attempts  and  requests  on  the
part  of  ATSDR  management  to  avoid  showing  maps  which  might  indicate  a  geo-
graphic  relationship  between  the  cases  of  polycythemia  vera  and  the  known  EPA
super fund sites.

A  representative  of  the  Agency  management  team  was  to  appear  at  the  presen-
tation  but  at  the  last  moment,  although  he  was  based  in  Atlanta,  he  stated  that
it  was  not  necessary  and  that  he  would  not  be  attending.  Several  days  prior  to  my
presentation at the Atlanta meeting the ATSDR—unknownst to me—issued a press
release stating that the abstract presented results that were premature and scientif-
ically flawed. Medical colleagues in Hazelton called me and informed me about this
disclaimer by the Agency, reports of which had appeared in the local press in Penn-
sylvania and asked me what I was going to do. I was a bit shocked and was incred-
ulous  about  the  lack  of  forthrightness  demonstrated  to  me  by  my  presumed  sci-
entific collaborators at ATSDR. I told the physicians in Hazelton that I still believed
that  the  data  were  correct  and  that  I  intended  to  present  the  information  and  let

the  scientific  community  evaluate  its  merit.  I  must  tell  you  I  felt  betrayed  by  the
leadership  of  ATSDR  since  I  had  made  great  efforts  to  get  these  leaders  involved
in the content of the abstract and obtain their approval. After my arrival in Atlanta,
I  was  contacted  on  my  cell  phone  on  repeated  occasions  by  officials  of  ATSDR  re-
questing that I either withdraw the abstract entirely, state prior to my presentation
that  the  Agency  disagreed  with  my  conclusions  or  present  an  abridged  version  of
the  data.  I  was  intimidated  by  these  frequent  calls  by  government  officials  which
created a great degree of stress and anxiety for me. I was also outraged at this obvi-
ous  attempt  at  intimidation.  I  refused  to  alter  the  presentation  and  presented  it  in
its entirety although ATSDR continued to undermine its validity in the press. I felt
justified in these actions since numerous members of the Agency had previously re-
peatedly  approved  the  content  of  the  abstract.  The  presentation  was  well  received
and  the  scientific  community  accepted  the  possibility  that  environmental  contami-
nants might play a role in the development of polycythemia vera in the patients in
the Tamaqua area.

After  receiving  this  positive  feedback  from  the  members  of  the  American  Society
of  Hematology,  I  realized  that  the  only  way  that  I  could  further  validate  the  data
was  for  it  to  be  published  in  a  peer  reviewed  journal  so  that  once  and  for  all  this
data would be in the public domain and be open to further scientific input and criti-
cism.  Upon  Dr.  Seaman’s  return  from  Mozambique  we  began  writing  this  manu-
script. The senior leadership of the Agency continued to doubt these conclusions and
insisted that the Agency’s biostatisticians perform sophisticated geospatial analyses
to  further  test  the  validity  of  our  findings.  I  strongly  agreed  with  their  scientific
rigor  not  wanting  to  be  associated  with  incorrect  information.  This  cluster  analysis
was  done  using  Satscan,  a  geospatial  software  tool  developed  by  the  National  Can-
cer Institute for the detection of cancer clusters. The chance of the likelihood of the
polycythemia vera cluster being a random event based on the total number of cases
in  the  tri-county  area  was  calculated  by  the  Agency  statisticians  independently  of
my  input  or  that  of  Dr.  Seaman.  A  single  statistically  significant  cluster  of  poly-
cythemia  vera  patients  (p<0.001)  was  identified  near  the  geographic  center  of  the
three counties. The incidence of polycythemia vera in the cluster area was 4.3 times
higher  than  that  in  the  rest  of  the  county.  The  probability  of  one  finding  greater
than  15  cases  of  polycythemia  vera  in  this  area  and  18  cases  in  the  remainder  of
the  tri-county  area  was  one  in  220,000.  The  probability  of  the  cluster  being  a  ran-
dom event based on the total number of confirmed cases in the tri-county area was
1/2000. Several sources of hazardous materials were located in or near the high rate
area  of  polycythemia  vera.  Seven  of  the  16  waste  coal  power  plants  in  the  United
States  are  located  in  or  within  this  area  or  within  a  few  miles  of  the  area.  Seven
U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  super  fund  sites  are  contained  within  this
area  and  another  possible  cluster  area  that  was  identified.  This  manuscript  was
completed  and  revised  on  numerous  occasions  with  the  participation  of  members  of
the ATSDR and the Epidemiology Branch of the Pennsylvania Department of Public
Health.  Numerous  revisions  were  made  on  the  manuscript  based  upon  the  sugges-
tions  of  the  ATSDR  and  the  Pennsylvania  Department  of  Public  Health  without
compromising  the  validity  of  the  information  presented.  The  manuscript  was  re-
viewed  and  revised  word  by  word  during  several  teleconferences.  This  manuscript
was  accepted  by  the  peer  reviewed  journal,  Cancer,  Epidemiology,  Biomarkers  and
Prevention  published  in  February  2009.  During  the  submission  process,  a  number
of  minor  changes  were  made  in  the  manuscript  to  accommodate  the  Journal’s  re-
viewers  and  specific  publication  format  requirements.  This  is  a  routine  process  and
ATSDR  did  not  require  the  final  version  of  the  manuscript  to  be  re-cleared.  After
the manuscript was published, the chief epidemiologist at the Pennsylvania Depart-
ment  of  Health,  who  had  actively  participated  in  the  word-by-word  editing  of  the
manuscript  even  though  he  was  not  an  author,  became  very  upset  when  he  found
that  the  manuscript  had  been  altered.  He  made  numerous  calls  to  high-placed  offi-
cials  at  ATSDR  in  an  effort  to  get  them  to  discredit  the  manuscript.  The  ATSDR
management resisted these efforts as they recognized that the manuscript contained
factual,  scientifically  valid  information  and  there  was  no  basis  for  the  claims  being
made by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

I  also  participated  in  a  round  table  discussion  of  expert  researchers  convened  by
ATSDR and the Pennsylvania Department of Public Health in Philadelphia later in
2008  to  identify  research  priorities  about  further  investigating  the  extent  of  the
cluster of cases of polycythemia vera in the tri-county area and determining possible
factors that might have led to this cluster. The data that was presented in the paper
published  in  Cancer,  Epidemiology,  Biomarkers  and  Prevention  I  believe  is  impor-
tant and valid. I believe that it provides information which justifies continued real-
istic concerns that there is a relationship between a cluster of cases of polycythemia
vera and serious environmental exposures in the tri-county area. This concern clear-

ly  merits  careful,  additional,  detailed  objective  rigorous  scientific  investigation  to
better  define  the  magnitude  of  this  problem  and  what  are  the  possible  causes  of
such  an  event.  This  information  is  of  potential  importance  not  only  for  the  popu-
lation  of  this  tri-county  area  but  to  all  citizens  of  the  United  States  because  it  pro-
vides  a  possible  link  between  the  environment  and  blood  cancers,  an  association
that has not to date been well documented.

ATSDR  is  the  leading  federal  public  health  agency  responsible  for  determining
human  health  effects  associated  with  toxic  exposures,  preventing  continued  expo-
sures and mitigating associated human health risks at the 1200 National Priorities
hazard waste sites targeted for cleanup by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agen-
cy. The mission of the ATSDR is stated to be ‘‘to generate and communicate credible
scientific information about the relationship between hazardous substances and ad-
verse human health effects and to promote responsive public health actions.’’ My ex-
perience  was  that  in  the  case  of  the  polycythemia  vera  cluster  in  Eastern  Pennsyl-
vania  that  ATSDR  accomplished  this  goal  only  because  of  the  relentless  prodding
to  complete  the  needed  investigations  due  in  part  to  the  efforts  of  some  of  the  tal-
ented  staff  at  the  Agency  working  in  collaboration  with  our  group  at  the  Mount
Sinai School of Medicine in New York and the continued input of the physicians in
the  tri-county  area  and  of  course  the  residents  of  this  area.  My  sense  was  that  if
the  Agency  was  left  to  themselves  they  would  have  preferred  to  ignore  the  whole
problem.  ATSDR  seemed  committed  to  a  course  of  ignoring  and  discrediting  a
mounting  body  of  evidence  which  suggested  the  presence  of  a  cluster  of  poly-
cythemia vera patients in the tri-county area. The Agency appeared to be overly re-
sponsive to possible outside influences which compromised its ability to evaluate the
severity of this problem. Rather than questioning the validity of this cancer cluster
in  a  pro-active  manner,  their  initial  response  was  to  discount  its  significance  and
to  express  on  numerous  occasions  the  futility  in  attempting  to  link  the  cluster  of
these  cases  of  polycythemia  vera  to  any  specific  environmental  toxins.  This  type  of
work  is  obviously  difficult  and  time  consuming  but  appears  to  be  the  core  function
of this agency. If the Agency is not willing to evaluate such clusters in a pro-active
and  objective  fashion  and  closely  interact  with  individuals  with  different  and  com-
plementary areas of expertise then the possibility of their accomplishing their stated
goals  is  very  small.  The  scientific  nihilism  and  lack  of  respect  for  the  integrity  of
scientific  investigation  initially  displayed  by  members  of  the  Agency  surely  com-
promises  the  stated  mission  of  this  agency.  Their  unwillingness  to  look  objectively
at  the  compelling  data  generated  by  our  investigations  is  puzzling  and  disturbing
to  me.  The  Agency  has  many  talented,  skilled  energetic  professionals  in  its  ranks
who have expressed to me frustration and concern about their being held back from
fully  investigating  the  polycythemia  vera  cluster  in  Pennsylvania.  The  reasons  for
these  actions  and  their  rationale  remain  unclear.  Most  recently  the  Agency  has  be-
come  increasingly  more  committed  to  more  vigorously  investigating  the  poly-
cythemia  vera  cluster  and  its  causes.  I  congratulate  them  on  this  recent  change  in
policy. This behavior is much more appropriate and consistent with the stated mis-
sion of the Agency and will likely to lead to a growth of a valid body of information
that  will  provide  new  insight  into  the  significance  of  the  polycythemia  vera  cluster
in  Eastern  Pennsylvania  and  its  possible  causes.  In  addition  these  investigations
will likely provide new information about a possible link between blood cancers and
environmental  toxins.  Such  information  will  hopefully  be  helpful  in  decreasing  in
the  future  the  incidence  of  such  deadly  cancers  in  areas  of  such  high  risk  for  expo-
sure to environmental toxins.

tioning.

EXPLANATIONS OF ATSDR’S DEFICIENCIES

Dr.  Hoffman,  do  you  have  an  impression,  an  opinion  of  what  ac-
counts for ATSDR’s unwillingness to look at the data from the can-
cer cluster that you looked at? Do you think it is the leadership of
ATSDR or do you think it is the culture of ATSDR? Is there exter-
nal pressure? Is there a reason that comes to your mind to explain
their  reluctance  to  acknowledge  or  find  environmental  exposure
that may cause the cluster, the cancer cluster?

Dr. HOFFMAN. Well, first of all, I want to state that I think there
is a number of very talented investigators there and there is a very
talented staff so there is a lot of good folks there. My sense is that
they  felt  that  it  was  a  futile  effort  since  there  were  so  many  envi-
ronmental  toxins  in  that  area  to  essentially  develop  a  one-to-one
relationship  between  a  particular  environmental  toxin  and  the  de-
velopment  of  polycythemia  vera.  That  led  to  a  sense  of  futility.
What  was  articulated  to  me  on  numerous  occasions  was  that  even
if  we  found  out  that  the  incidence  of  polycythemia  vera  was  great-
est  in  this  area,  what  were  we  really  going  to  do  about  it,  could
we essentially define an additional—the known agent. That kind of
thinking  or  neolism,  I  would  call  it,  is  very  foreign  to  me  because
I  am  used  to  in  a  laboratory  at  least  solving  or  trying  to  attack
very complex scientific problems, and I really thought that that at-
titude  was  pervasive,  this  feeling  that  one  could  not  identify  the
toxic agent, and that led to, you know, sort of snowballed into sort
of  talking  away  or  speaking  away  or  downplaying  the  significance
of this cluster. I think what was also not perceived was the impor-
tance  of  the  cluster.  The  importance  of  the  cluster  really  went  be-
yond  just  this  particular  area  because  it  linked  very  conclusively,
especially  with  the  sophisticated  statistical  analysis  that  I  con-
gratulate them on performing which was very hard science showing
that it was highly unlikely that this was random. So what it really
shows  is  that  blood  cancers  in  general  could  be  related  to  environ-
mental  toxins.  That  is  a  very  important  question  and  observation.
The point is, is this a futile event? No, it is not a futile event mak-
ing  this  association  because  if  we  are  aware  of  this,  then  we  can
essentially  define  the  cause  of  this  and  hopefully  develop
chemopreventive agents to prevent additional patients from getting
these  cancers.  So  I  think  they  were  essentially  frozen  in  time,  and
because  of  this  sense  of  futility  and  perhaps  a  sense  of  under-
standing the whole gamut of hematologic malignancies, they didn’t
really appreciate the importance of it.

PEER REVIEW

Chair  MILLER.  Dr.  Hoffman,  you  congratulated  ATSDR  on  their
statistical  analysis  and  on  the  unlikely  possibility  that  it  would  be
random.

Dr. HOFFMAN. Right.

Chair MILLER. You have had your work peer reviewed. I assume
you  are  competent  to  do  peer  review.  Have  you  looked  at  enough
of  ATSDR’s  work  to  know  how  well  it  would  fare  in  peer  review?
Dr.  HOFFMAN.  Mr.  Miller,  I  am  really  not  an  epidemiologist.  I
mean, I am a hematologist and a blood scientist. Prior to this inter-
action  which  started  on  2006,  I  had  never  heard  of  this  agency  so
I am really incapable of evaluating their other work.

Chair  MILLER.  Do  you  think  that  there  would  be  a  value  in  re-

quiring peer review for at least some of their assessments?

Dr. HOFFMAN. I felt from my perspective, I wanted my work eval-
uated by outside reviewers. I wanted it evaluated and presented at
a  scientific  meeting  where  I  could  get  feedback  from  my  peers.  I
also wanted it to go to a scientific journal where people could show
me  that  I  was  wrong  because  I  was  not  really  interested  in  pre-
senting or publishing incorrect data. That is the way I was brought
up  scientifically.  I  think  that  is  a  healthy  way  to  act  within  any
kind of investigative effort if you are going to do real science.

MORE EXPLANATION OF DEFICIENCIES

Chair  MILLER.  Mr.  Mier,  you  used  to  work  for  the  CDC.  You
never  heard  of  ATSDR  but  you  were  inclined  to  assume  that  they
would  do  reliable  work  and  that  assumption  you  do  not  think
proved  to  be  correct.  What  do  you  think  is  the  reason  for  that?
What do you think happened? Why do you think they do not do the
job that you thought they would do?

Mr.  MIER.  You  know,  I  don’t  know  if  it  is  just  their  reluctance
to  go  after  an  industry.  I  know  that  in  Texas,  at  least  my  feeling
is that there is not much balance between the need to prosper eco-
nomically, to have jobs, and the need to care for public health and
the  environment,  and  in  our  state  my  biggest  concern  is  with  the
State  environmental  agency  and  my  biggest  concern  was  why
ATSDR  did  not  closer  evaluate  the  data  that  they  were  looking  at
upon  which  to  make  sweeping  generalizations  about  public  health.
To  me,  the  air  monitoring  system  was  so  suspect.  I  am  not  a  sci-
entist, but based on other scientists that I have dealt with have al-
ways told me that, and there is so much tinkering that can be done
with  the  various  aspects  of  the  monitoring  system.  And  why  they
would  not—not  just  ATSDR  but  the  State  public  health  agency
with  which  they  have  a  cooperative  agreement  with  in  Texas,  why
they  would  not  look  at  the  empirical  evidence.  I  always  felt  that
the best monitors were the animals in our community, much better
than  any  mechanical  device  that  we  could  have,  but  why  they
would  just  not  want  to  look  at  our  animal  issues  as  the  potential
for a sentinel for human health.

Chair  MILLER.  My  time  has  expired,  and  I  will  try  to  be  reason-

ably indulgent with the other Members as a result.

Dr. Broun for five minutes.
Mr. BROUN. Thank you, Chair Miller. I appreciate it.

POTENTIAL FIXES

We each have five minutes to ask questions so I am going to ask
a  pretty  broad  question  of  each  of  you  all  and  so  if  you  would,  try
to answer it within 30 seconds and we will go forward. If you were

a  dictator,  how  would  you  fix  ATSDR?  What  would  you  do?  I  will
start with Mr. Mier.

Mr.  MIER.  Boy,  you  know,  to  me  it  is  a  cultural  thing.  Someone

needs to go in there to let them know that——

Chair MILLER. I am sorry, Mr. Mier, your mic is not on.
Mr. MIER. Oh, I am sorry. There is nothing wrong in going after
or looking at an illness closely when it might potentially be related
to an industry. I think there is a tremendous reluctance to do that.
I understand it is a very complicated science but to run away from
it  and  not  look  at  strong  empirical  evidence,  to  me  I  just  can’t  un-
derstand that. When I was dealing in my own humble way looking
at  viruses  or  bacteria  and  the  issues  that  I  dealt  with  when  I
worked  with  CDC,  there  was  never  any  quarrel,  but  the  dynamics
changed drastically when you point a finger at an industry.

Mr.  BROUN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Mier.  We  need  to  fix  it  if  there  is
a  problem,  which  obviously  you  all  think  there  is  a  huge  problem
there. We are trying to look to try to find out—this is an investiga-
tion and oversight committee. We need to have some—I would like
to  hear  some  suggestions  of  how  to  fix  the  problem  and  not  just
wonder.  So  Professor,  do  you  have  any  suggestions  of  how  we  can
fix this problem?

Dr.  PARRISH.  I  mean,  I  think  big  organizations  have  inertia  and
if  you  want  to  change  them,  I  think  the  first  thing  I  would  do  if
I  was  dictating  would  be  to—I  would  clarify  what  the  remit  is,
what  is  the  mission  of  the  Agency  and  what  is  its  relationship  to
other  public  health  agencies  and  states,  for  example.  I  know  this
because ATSDR bumps up against these other things from time to
time.  So  you  need  to  clarify  what  your  boundaries  are,  and  then  I
think  once  you  have  that  mission  really  clear,  you  have  to  recruit
the  leadership  and  the  senior  management  team  to  implement  the
vision  for  the  Agency  and  make  sure  they  have  the  resources  so
they  can  actually  pursue  that  mission  with  vigor.  That  is  what  I
would do.

Mr. BROUN. Mr. Camplin.
Mr.  CAMPLIN.  Two  things.  One,  I  would  recommend  that  they
open up the process a little bit more on the very front end so there
is  a  little  bit  more  agreement  and  buy-in  along  the  whole  way  as
well  as  having  that  third  party  oversight,  the  peer  review  over-
sight.  We  have  requested  that  on  numerous  occasions  and  it  falls
upon  deaf  ears.  The  other  side  of  it  is  accountability.  There  are
policies  and  procedures  in  place  that  they  are  supposed  to  be  fol-
lowing and there doesn’t seem to be any kind of accountability and
I know in our case at the Illinois Beach State Park, we would love
for  this  committee  to  request  the  FBI  to  meet  with  myself  along
with Mr. Paul Kakuris of the Illinois Dunesland Preservation Soci-
ety so we can turn over evidence of what we believe is criminal ac-
tivity as well.

Mr.  BROUN.  Doctor,  I  would  love  to  talk  to  you  about  the  JAK2
mutation  and  all  those  things  as  a  fellow  physician,  but  again,  if
you  were  dictator,  what  would  you  do  to  fix  this?  And  I  certainly
believe  in  peer  review  as  a  physician.  We  look  at  those  types  of
things. And I congratulate you on your research in this—into these
blood diseases.

Dr.  HOFFMAN.  Well,  I  guess  I  am  a  little  bit  more  optimistic
about this culture. I think there are—again, I will repeat, there are
excellent  people  there.  This  is  not  a  deficiency  in  the  talent  of  the
staff. I think what they really need to be is basically cut loose and
be told to do good science and unrestricted science. I think the sub-
mission  of  work  to  peer  review  journals  should  be  encouraged  be-
cause  once  that  was  accomplished  and  once  the  paper  was  accept-
ed,  everything  turned  around,  and  in  fact  when  the  Pennsylvania
Department  of  Health  when  they  finally  saw  our  manuscript  were
upset  about  some  of  the  conclusions  that  were  made.  ATSDR  to
their credit actually said that they weren’t going to change or deny
anything  because  they  had  shown  that  it  was  correct  and  it  was
peer  reviewed.  So  from  my  perspective,  going  through  this  over  a
couple of years with them, I think they need consultants that have
a  lot  of  scientific  information  and  can  bring  more  to  the  table  and
then  they  should  be  cut  loose  to  essentially  test  whether  these
things  are  scientifically  valid.  If  not,  their  resources  will  be  de-
pleted.  They  have  to  find  out  what  is  really,  really  important  and
then they have to go after it as a scientific mission.

Mr.  BROUN.  Thank  you  all.  Chair,  I  am  about  out  of  time  and
I just—we are going to submit written questions for you all to look
at. I am sure that I look forward to your answers further.

Chair  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Broun.  In  the  last  Congress,  Mr.
Rohrabacher  was  a  Member  of  the  Committee  so  everyone  else’s
adherence  to  the  five-minute  rule  looked  pretty  strict  by  compari-
son  but  if  everyone  adheres  to  the  five-minute  rule,  I  am  going  to
have to change my own conduct.

Mr. Grayson. Oh, I am sorry. Ms. Dahlkemper is next.
Ms. DAHLKEMPER. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

GEOGRAPHIC PREVALENCE OF DEFICIENCIES

I  believe  one  of  the  biggest  roles  of  government  is  public  safety,
and each of you are from a different area of the country. I am from
Pennsylvania where obviously Dr. Hoffman is from, but you are all
from  different  parts  of  the  country  and  we  are  seeing  sort  of  a  re-
telling of the story. Do any of you have other areas where you have
talked with colleagues kind of dealing with this same type of issue
in terms of the conduct of ATSDR? It is open to any of you.

Dr.  PARRISH.  I  will  just  say,  first  of  all,  I  don’t  because  I  live  in

the United Kingdom so I will drop out of that.

Mr.  CAMPLIN.  I  will  mention  that  at  least  on  the  asbestos  side
of  things,  I  have  talked  with  many  of  the  people  over  in  Libby,
Montana,  where  there  is  currently  an  investigation  going  on  with
W.R.  Grace  and  their  exposure  to  asbestos  there,  and  the  persons
I  have  talked  to,  they  consider  ATSDR  and  EPA  more  of  the  dark
side  or  the  evil  side  than  the  actual  polluters,  W.R.  Grace  them-
selves.  They  do  not  agree  with  their  science  and  they  do  not  agree
with the politics that are there as well.

Ms.  DAHLKEMPER.  Mr.  Mier  or  Dr.  Hoffman,  have  either  one  of
you  had  any  talk  with  other  colleagues  in  other  areas  of  the  coun-
try who have had problems with this agency?

Mr. MIER. I talked to a few in Louisiana and other parts of Texas
but frankly, my wife and I have been—we are retired grandparents
and  we  have  been  so  busy  researching  and  addressing  this  issue

that I haven’t spent a lot of time talking to other people except that
when I felt that we were going to have the same people looking at
it again in the same old way and not getting an objective new look
at  it,  that  is  when  I  begged  for  help  from  scientists  around  the
country  that  were  familiar  with  these  issues  and  had  them  review
our draft consultation report.

PUBLIC AWARENESS

Ms.  DAHLKEMPER.  And  my  other  question  to  all  four  of  you,  I
guess,  is,  the  people  in  the  communities  where  you  are  dealing
with, how much of this information has been put out to the general
public,  what  is  the  reaction.  You  know,  Mr.  Mier,  you  still  live  in
Midlothian. I mean——

Mr. MIER. I tell you, this is a very sensitive issue in our commu-
nity. When we are talking about potentially implicating four indus-
tries with as many employees and family members as are involved,
it  is  a  very  sensitive  issue  and  so  they  are  very  defensive  about
pointing  any  fingers  at  any  of  the  industries  so  it  is  a  very  sen-
sitive  issue  to  discuss  in  our  community  both  at  city  government
and even on the school board. So there are very few of us that are
actually  working  on  it  and  addressing  it  and  we  are  looked  at  in
a  very  different,  negative  light,  I  think  but  a  lot  of  people  in  the
community,  unfortunately,  and  our  only  concern  frankly  is  our
grandchildren and other children and children yet to be born in our
community and that is why are we looking at it. We are not satis-
fied with the answers that we are getting and we think that there
may be some problems and we are not satisfied with the way it has
been looked at so far.

Ms. DAHLKEMPER. Thank you for your courage.
Chair MILLER. Each of the witnesses and our Members can make
a point of taking the microphone. Although we can hear you, there
are  others  who  are  watching  this  on  the  Internet,  et  cetera,  and  it
is helpful for recording the hearing later.

Mr. CAMPLIN. I would like to make one point about that. Without
a  doubt,  the  public  does  give  the  Agency  a  lot  of  credibility  when
they  put  any  kind  of  report  out  and  so  there  is  a  doubt.  When  we
challenge anything that they say, they tend to get the benefit of the
doubt  and  it  isn’t  until  we  are  able  to  prove  motive—because  that
is  what  they  would  say,  why  would  an  agency  like  this,  such  a
prominent  agency,  put  out  such  faulty  reports.  And  when  we  ex-
plain the motives, then it becomes very clear. But that is one of the
problems in the community is, they believe in these agencies. They
believe in what this agency at least used to stand for.

Ms. DAHLKEMPER. Yes?
Dr.  PARRISH.  I  mean,  I  could  just  say  that  in  the  situation  of
Colonie, New York, the industry that did the polluting is long gone,
so it is a legacy issue, and I think generally the health consultation
done  there  added  very  little  new  knowledge.  It  didn’t  seem—it
caused a great deal of frustration in a way because I think expecta-
tions  were  very  high  that  this  was  going  to  add  new  insight,  pro-
vide solutions and so forth and it basically did none of those things.
And so, you know, on the one hand I know there are a lot of people
in  that  area  in  government  and  industry  that  basically  would  like
the  whole  issue  to  sort  of  go  away  and  be  buried  but  on  the  other

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00260 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

253

hand,  in  particular  the  research  that  we  did  certainly  served  to
raise  awareness  of  the  issues  and,  you  know,  by  undermining  part
of  the  methodology  that  ATSDR  used  in  their  health  consultation,
it  has  actually  sort  of  in  a  certain  portion  of  the  community  pro-
vided  a  way  forward,  I  think,  for  progress  in  the  future  that  was
otherwise completely stalled.

Ms. DAHLKEMPER. Thank you.
Chair MILLER. The gentlelady’s time had only expired by a little

bit.

Mr. Bilbray.
Mr. BILBRAY. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Dr. Hoffman, I want to thank you for not just your testimony but
also  highlighting  again  that  coal-fired  power  plants  leave  a  legacy
of  destruction  far  beyond  air  pollution  and  a  sad  state  of  affairs,
if I may say it again, that while we talk about the executive branch
not  doing  enough  oversight  here  and  not  looking  at  this  issue,  at
the  same  time  the  legislative  branch,  this  Congress  is  still  buying
coal-fired  electricity  to  power  our  lights  overhead,  and  never  pass
up  a  chance  to  take  a  cheap  shot,  so  I  want  to  put  that  out.  You
know,  clean  coal  is  as  logical  as  safe  cigarettes,  and  thank  you  for
bringing up that there are other issues.
ASBESTOS

Mr.  Camplin,  your  work  with  the  asbestos  problem  here,  specifi-
cally  this  site,  just  for  my  own  information,  are  we  talking  short
fiber, long fiber or is it a mixture of both at this site that you were
working with?

Mr. CAMPLIN. It is not only a mixture of short and long fibers but
they  are  finding  predominantly  amphibole  minerals,  which  are
much,  much  more  toxic,  and  that  is  even  more  disturbing  because
they put disclaimers in a lot of their reports saying in fact that the
risk modeling may significantly underestimate these minerals that
are there, so there is some debate on what type of asbestos is toxic.
However,  what  they  are  finding  on  the  beach  there  is  no  debate
about  it.  It  is  the  most  virulent,  amphibole  forms  of  the  mineral.
Mr.  BILBRAY.  Yes,  in  California  ARB,  we  found  there  was  a  dis-
tinct  separation  that  has  to  be,  you  know,  to  really  be  precise  on
this.  Of  course,  at  the  same  time  we  are  talking  about  that,  our
roads  are  paved  with  serpentine,  which  is  all  asbestos  and  every-
body  that  drives  down  a  back  road  in  the  Sierra  Nevadas  is  being
exposed.

Mr. CAMPLIN. Well, it is the State mineral of California.
Mr.  BILBRAY.  Yeah.  Well,  I  guess  it  is  appropriate  with  our  air
quality. But traditionally with toxicology there are two major meas-
urements.  One  is  level  exposure  and  duration  of  exposure,  and
though  asbestos  is  different  because  certain  fibers,  certain  types
can  lodge  in  the  lungs  and  maintain  there  and  continue  to  irritate
and  create  the  problem.  Do  you  think  that  the  Agency  might  have
been  using  like  your  instance  the  short  duration  of  exposure  as  a
justification  to  reduce  the  risk  level  from  the  toxicology  point  of
view?

Mr.  CAMPLIN.  It  is  even  more  obvious  than  that.  If  you  were
going to test beach activities, I would ask maybe Dr. Frumkin why
his team has never reviewed data from June, July or early August,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00261 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

254

which we would consider the beach season, and why approximately
30 to 40 percent of the time that they do air monitoring it happens
to  be  either  raining  or  it  just  did  rain.  So  that  alone  we  think
skews the data tremendously, and then getting into their protocols
themselves  and  the  outdated  risk  models  they  use,  that  just  com-
plicates things even further.

Mr.  BILBRAY.  Okay.  Well,  coming  from  southern  California,  my

perception is it is always raining in your part of the world.

Mr. CAMPLIN. It is.
Mr. BILBRAY. That is the challenge that we get over there.
You  know,  the  Texas  model  I  guess  really  kind  of  highlights  too
the  fact  that  when  we  get  into  these  groups  that  somehow  when
we try to get this agency to straighten out, we are treating a symp-
tom of a deeper problem, and that is, places like Texas not having
clean, inexpensive electricity so we can stop drawing on these dirty,
cheap  sources  that  create  the  problem.  But  I  appreciate  all  your
testimony.

LOCAL HEALTH PROTECTION

Mr. Chair, my biggest concern is that when we talk about public
health  protection  as  the  gentlelady  said  and  we  say  it  is  govern-
ment, I just would like to remind all of us as somebody who comes
from  a  background  of  being  the  Agency  in  the  neighborhood,  the
frontline of health protection is not those of us in the Federal Gov-
ernment.  We  are  the  last  line  of  protection.  The  first  line  is  the
local  community,  the  local  environmental  health  department,  the
local air district, and one of the biggest things I want to do is make
sure  that  the  Feds  are  there  to  support  the  local  effort.  We  have
seen with Katrina what happens when the locals wait for the Feds
to  show  up,  as  opposed  to  what  you  saw  in  San  Diego  during  our
fires,  they  kept  saying  FEMA  did  so  well.  It  is  only  because  the
locals  didn’t  wait  for  FEMA  to  do  it,  FEMA  came  in  and  helped,
and one of the things I want to make sure is that when we reform
this approach that it is one of coming in and helping the local com-
munity  protect  their  own  neighborhoods  as  opposed  to  waiting  for
the Feds. Because the biggest shock I had when I moved out of San
Diego  to  Washington,  D.C.,  is  I  look  around  the  environment  in
this community and the environmental health around this commu-
nity  and  let  me  assure  you,  I  do  not  want  my  neighborhoods  to  be
controlled by the people who are taking care of the environment in
Washington,  D.C.,  right  now,  and  that  is  one  of  those  things  that
I  think  all  of  us  should  work  at  empowering  the  local  community
to  address  these  issues  and  hopefully  we  can  use  this  review  as  a
way of doing more of that.
I yield back, Mr. Chair.
Chair MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Bilbray.
Mr. Grayson for five minutes.

VIEQUES, PUERTO RICO

Mr.  GRAYSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  I  appreciate  the  members
of  this  panel  and  what  they  have  done  to  highlight  the  failures  of
the ATSDR but I would like to talk about a different circumstance
that  has  come  up  that  I  think  further  underlines  the  situation.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00262 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

255

That  is  the  situation  that  I  am  talking  about  regarding  Vieques,
which  is  an  island  off  the  coast  of  Puerto  Rico.  Vieques  is  a  beau-
tiful place. Its economy is based on fishing and tourism, and for 62
years it served as a military testing ground for the Navy. And now
it  is  the  subject  of  a  great  debate  concerning  the  accuracy  of
ATSDR testing. The military used among other weapons chemicals
such  as  napalm,  Agent  Orange  and  depleted  uranium  in  and
around the waters of Vieques. In 2003 the Navy stopped that mili-
tary  testing  and  the  area  has  become  a  Superfund  site  because  of
the  heavy  presence  of  metals  and  toxins  in  the  area.  It  is  being
cleaned  up  but  there  is  a  lot  of  chemical  residue  that  remains.
There  are  dangerous  levels  of  heavy  metals  and  toxins  that  have
shown up in the crabs, in the fish, in the goats, in the wild horses
that roam the island and the vegetation and in the people who live
there.  The  health  statistic  in  Vieques  show  the  consequences  of
those  toxins  compared  to  normal  residents  of  Puerto  Rico.  Resi-
dents of Vieques have a 269 percent increased chance of cancer and
a  73  percent  increased  chance  of  heart  disease  and  many  other
health problems. Infant mortality in most of Puerto Rico is decreas-
ing, but in Vieques it is increasing and it has been increasing since
1980.  And  a  2001  study  looking  at  the  hair  of  the  residents  in
Vieques  showed  that  73  percent  of  these  human  beings  were  con-
taminated with aluminum and 30 percent of the children under 10
years old showed toxic levels of mercury.

One  of  my  constituents,  Rubin  Ojeda,  a  former  fisherman  in  the
area,  told  me  almost  every  person  that  he  knows  in  Vieques  has
cancer or a family member who has cancer or other serious illness.
Rubin  fished  while  the  Navy  dropped  bombs  around  him  and  he
suffers from heart and respiratory disease as well as deafness. His
mother  has  anemia,  high  blood  pressure  and  diabetes.  His  uncle
died  of  cancer  and  several  of  his  fellow  fisherman  have  also  died
of  cancer  at  young  ages.  In  other  words,  in  Vieques,  heavy  metal
poisons the land and the water and the population carries that poi-
son  in  its  bloodstream  and  there  is  no  real  debate  about  this  any-
more.

But somehow when this agency, ATSDR, tested the area, it stat-
ed  that  the  poisons  in  the  fish  and  the  crabs  and  the  vegetation
somehow posed no threat or no danger to the residents. This agen-
cy,  which  is  supposed  to  protect  our  children  form  poisons  at
Superfund  sites,  actually  wrote  that  it  is  safe  to  eat  the  seafood
from  the  coastal  waters  and  near-shore  lands  and  that  residents
have  not  been  exposed  to  harmful  levels  of  chemicals  resulting
from Navy training activities. These remarkable statements should
not come as a surprise for anybody who actually knows this agency.
It  is  famous  for  ignoring  the  dangers  of  formaldehyde  in  the  trail-
ers  used  by  Katrina  victims,  and  for  that  the  Agency  was  publicly
chided  by  its  own  chief  toxicologist,  who  had  been  cut  out  of  the
loop  after  raising  concerns  about  the  scientific  basis  for  the  Agen-
cy’s analysis.

In case after case documented in an excellent report put together
by  the  Science  and  Technology  Oversight  and  Investigations  Sub-
committee, this agency has trivialized health concerns and failed to
stop  the  ingestion  of  poison  and  the  spreading  of  cancer.  In  other
words,  Vieques  is  not  an  isolated  incident.  There  is  a  problem  of

leadership,  structure  and  agency  culture,  and  from  its  inception  in
the  early  1980s  this  agency  has  fought  with  bureaucratic  rivals,
shortchanged  science  and  public  health,  and  as  a  result  it  has  let
children be poisoned, and this too should come to us as no surprise
because the Reagan Administration, which oversaw the creation of
this  agency,  never  found  an  environmental  protection  that  it  did
not  try  to  dismantle.  Despite  that  origin,  there  are  good  and  con-
scientious  employees  within  the  Agency  and  I  am  hopeful  that  we
can  work  to  restructure  this  agency  so  that  its  leadership  is  com-
mitted to protecting the public from harm. They should at the very
least  start  with  the  acknowledgement  that  its  work  in  Vieques  is
flawed and it should start with a commitment to reassess that site
and take into account the various independent studies which show
elevated health risks in the area.

You  know,  we  try  so  hard  as  Members  of  Congress  to  improve
people’s lives. When I look at what has happened in Vieques, when
I  see  all  the  health  problems  that  Navy  testing  there  has  caused
and the health problems that have been perpetuated by the failure
of this agency to do anything about it, I am reminded of the Hippo-
cratic  oath.  Maybe  the  first  thing  we  should  to  do  as  Members  of
Congress  is  very  simple.  The  first  thing  that  the  government
should try to do is very simple: first, do no harm. Thank you.

Chair MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Grayson.
Mr.  Tonko  is  not  a  Member  of  this  subcommittee.  He  is  a  Mem-
ber  of  the  Full  Committee,  and  as  a  courtesy  the  Chair  is  happy

COLONIE, NEW YORK

Mr.  TONKO.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  for  this  very  valuable  hear-
ing,  and  to  the  panelists,  thank  you  for  being  here.  I  represent
Colonie,  New  York,  via  the  21st  Congressional  District  in  New
York,  and  so  my  questions  are  directed  towards  Professor  Parrish.
Professor,  so  I  can  be  perfectly  clear  on  this  issue,  the  ATSDR
people,  did  they  test  at  all,  did  they  use  a  certain  method  or  did
they not test workers and residents?

Dr. PARRISH. They did not test.
Mr. TONKO. So you were the only group that tested?
Dr. PARRISH. That is correct.
Mr.  TONKO.  And  when  your  system  that  you  offered  to  ATSDR

Dr. PARRISH. Well, our work first went through considerable peer
review  in  the  U.K.  to  do  with  interlaboratory  comparisons  and  so
forth and that work was published in 2006. The method was devel-
oped  in  2003  and  it  was  applied  to  basically  a  very  large  cohort  of
U.K.  Gulf  War  veterans  in  the  period  2004  to  2006.  So  we  tested
hundreds of U.K. veterans for depleted uranium in their urine dur-
ing  that  period  of  time.  I  mean,  this  is  the  whole  reason  I  started
working  in  Colonie  is  to  pursue  this  topic  that  I  got  involved  in  in

was exchanged with their people information-wise——

Dr. PARRISH. I have had no contact at all with ATSDR.

ever.

the  U.K.  as  a  result  of  working  with  the  government  to  test  vet-
erans  of  the  first  Gulf  War.  And  what  we  found  in  that  particular
situation  is  we  failed  to  find  a  single  person  who  had  had  a  DU
positive result. Everybody was normal. And this raised a really im-
portant question. The question really was, were the veterans of the
1991  conflict  never  exposed  to  DU  in  the  battlefield  or  were  they
actually  exposed,  did  they  acquire  harm,  for  example,  but  has  it
been  too  long  a  period  of  time  since  the  testing  in  order  to  detect
the  signature.  So  we  needed—the  reason  we  went  to  Colonie  was
to follow this issue until it logically was concluded, and the reason
that Colonie is important is, there is undoubtedly a very significant
exposure  to  a  lot  of  people  to  the  inhalation  of  depleted  uranium
oxides  is  arising  because  of  the  manufacturing  at  the  plant,  so  we
knew  there  was  an  exposed  population,  so  we  went  there  to  try  to
find  out,  can  we  see  the  signature  in  their  urine?  Even  after  20
years, and the answer was yes, we could.

Mr.  TONKO.  Now,  my  question  to  you  also,  were  there  any  opin-
ions  offered  as  to  that  method  by  professionals  from  ATSDR,  for-
mal or informal, that were exchanged with you?

Dr.  PARRISH.  No,  because  I  have  had  no  contact,  none  whatso-

Mr.  TONKO.  So  is  there  anything  that  we  can  do  to  go  forward
with  the  town  of  Colonie?  Should  there  be  any  concerns  or  fears
that  the  town  residents—there  are  some  theories  that  as  many  as
2,000  homes,  if  not  more,  I  hear  many  oftentimes  2,000  homes
being  in  the  area  of  the  factory  and  of  course  the  factory  workers,
should they still have concerns about depleted uranium?

Dr.  PARRISH.  Well,  let  me  first  say  that,  you  know,  I  am  not  a
medical  doctor  so  don’t  misconstrue  my  opinions  here,  but  I  sup-
pose  my  general  view  is  that  the  heaviest  pollution  took  place  in
the  1970s  and  affected  probably  in  the  neighborhood  of  less  than
perhaps 1,000 people, and I am sort of drawing a line around, you
know, perhaps 600 to 800 meters around the plant, but there were
lots of houses and the residential area is extensive. Sorry.

Mr. TONKO. No, I was just going to ask, has the Agency ever con-

tacted you to discuss your findings?

Dr. PARRISH. No, they have not.
Mr. TONKO. Do you think they were aware of your findings?
Dr.  PARRISH.  They  are—I  mean,  I  know  that  they—people  have
told  me  that  there  has  been  some  contact  with  ATSDR  about  my
paper but they have not contacted me.

Mr. TONKO. And should the Agency go back to the area?
Dr. PARRISH. Well, I think somebody should go back. If the Agen-
cy  has  got  a  different  attitude,  then  they  should  go  back  and  redo
some  of  the  work,  and  some  of  the  things  they  need  to  do  are  to
find the people who lived there and were most heavily exposed, re-
gardless  of  where  they  live  now.  They  need  to  find  these  people.
Then they need to do basically a health kind of census, what is the
state  of  health  and  death  results,  for  example,  in  the  area  that  is
closest  to  the  plant.  If  there  is  something  untoward  going  on  in
terms of that, then they could institute a series of testing programs
to find out whether depleted uranium, for example, could be a cor-
related feature to those health problems. So I think there is a way
forward to do this whole program there.

Mr.  TONKO.  Now,  the  Agency  claims  that,  in  quotes,  it  ‘‘serves
the  public  by  using  the  best  science.’’  Have  they  avoided  the  best
science? Have they used the best science?

Dr. PARRISH. Well, I think my words were, they either chose not
to or were unaware of the analysis tools at the time they did their
report in order to determine whether people had an exposure. This
was  possible  now.  It  certainly  is  possible  now.  They  concluded  it
wasn’t possible——

Mr. TONKO. And if we use——
Dr. PARRISH.—in their report.
Mr. TONKO. I am sorry. If we use your base number of 1,000 for
round terms, is there an estimated cost that the Agency should as-
sume will be borne upon it?

Dr.  PARRISH.  You  know,  I  suppose—I  have  been  asked  question
and  I  would  have  thought  that  you  could  commit  something  like
perhaps  $1  million  or  something,  and  with  that  sort  of  money  you
could  undertake  a  census  to  find  the  individuals,  look  at  their
health  and  other  death  statistics  as  well  as  conduct  urinary  tests
for  uranium  isotope  exposure  on  perhaps  several  hundred  people.
You could certainly go some distance to make progress towards the
resolution of the issue.

Mr.  TONKO.  As  I  understand  it,  the  Federal  Government  spent

nearly $200 million——

Dr. PARRISH. That is correct, on the cleanup.
Mr.  TONKO.—on  the  cleanup.  Is  that  cleanup  sufficient?  Do  you

have any sense professionally whether or not——

Dr.  PARRISH.  I  think—the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  did  the
cleanup.  I  think  they  did  a  good  job.  What  they  did  is  remediate
the  site  so  that  it  could  then  be  turned  over  eventually  for  some
other  purpose,  but  the  primary  health  danger  that  was  at  the  site
arose  during  the  plant’s  original  operation  in  the  1960s  and  1970s
and  early  1980s  and  so  once  the  plant  stopped  operating,  the  im-
mediate  health  risk,  as  I  understand  it,  diminished  considerably
because emissions of depleted uranium oxide particulates that were
inhalable then more or less ceased, and so the ongoing issues relate
to  sort  of  secondary  ingestion  of  contaminated  soil  or  perhaps  re-
suspension of dust. But we have also found that there are high lev-
els of settled dust in attics and basements and houses and so forth,
and this may be an ongoing health issue. I don’t know.

Mr.  TONKO.  Just  one  quick  final  question,  and  I  appreciate  your
tolerance,  Mr.  Chair,  but  it  is  very  important  to  this  community
and  to  the  district.  There  were  allegations  that  the  company  had
bypassed smokestack filters.

Dr. PARRISH. Yes.
Mr. TONKO. Do you have an opinion on that?
Dr. PARRISH. I have been told this is a fact, and I have no doubt

that it is.

Mr.  TONKO.  Well,  obviously  it  is  an  issue  that  still  needs  to

Dr. PARRISH. I think the—is it New York Department of Environ-
mental  Conservation,  I  believe,  they  documented  this  at  the  time
in  the  late  1970s  so  there  is  no  doubt  that  this  has  taken  place.

Chair  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Tonko.  You  were  still  well  short

of Mr. Rohrabacher’s territory.

Dr.  Broun,  if  you  would  give  me  the  indulgence  of  just  one  last

question, not a whole other round.

ANIMALS AS SENTINELS OF HUMAN HEALTH

Mr.  Mier,  Professor  Parrish  just  discussed  the  willingness  of
ATSDR  to  contact  him  and  talk  to  him.  Has  ATSDR  looked  at  the
animals that were in your film?

Mr. MIER. No, sir.
Chair MILLER. Have you asked them to?
Mr. MIER. Yes, we have.
Chair MILLER. And what did they say?
Mr.  MIER.  Initially  the  response  was  that  it  wasn’t  within  their
mandated  domain.  Afterwards  we  were  told  that  neither  ATSDR
nor the Texas Department of State Health Services had the exper-
tise, and the latest communication was that the Texas Department
of  Health  has  contacted  a  couple  of  researchers  at  Texas  A&M
School of Veterinary Medicine who might be interested in pursuing
but  that  first  of  all  they  have  to  write  a  proposal  and  then  hope-
fully seek grant funds to do that.

Chair MILLER. I am not sure that Mr. Mier is the best—Mr. Mier
is  not  a  scientist.  Perhaps  Dr.  Hoffman  is  the  best  to  direct  this
question  to.  Is  there  a  value,  a  recognized  value  in  medical  re-
search  that  effects  on  animals  are  an  indicator,  a  sentinel  for  ef-
fects on humans?

Dr.  HOFFMAN.  In  certain  situations  they  are.  There  is  not  nec-
essarily  100  percent  correlation  between  the  effects  on  small  ani-
mals  and  humans,  but  I  mean,  you  know,  as  was  shown  on  that
film, I think it is of concern. I mean, I have no idea what the inci-
dence  of  similar  abnormalities  are  in  that  area  in  Texas  but  obvi-
ously that would be of more substantive data to examine.

Chair MILLER. It would get your attention?
Dr.  HOFFMAN.  Well,  as  it  did  in  the  area  in  Pennsylvania,  yes.
Chair  MILLER.  Thank  you  to  all  the  members  of  this  panel  for
your  testimony,  for  coming  here  and  for  answering  our  questions
as  well.  We  will  now  take  a  fairly  short  break  before  the  next
panel. Thank you.

[Recess.]

Panel II:

Chair  MILLER.  I  would  like  to  introduce  our  second  panel.  Dr.
Ronnie  Wilson,  in  addition  to  being  a  former  country  music  disc
jockey  as  he  told  me  in  the  break,  probably  more  pertinent  to  this
hearing  was  the  Ombudsman  as  ATSDR  from  1998  to  2005  and
teaches  now  full  time  at  Central  Michigan  University.  Dr.  David
Ozonoff is a Professor of Environmental Health at the Boston Uni-
versity School of Public Health, and Dr. Henry S. Cole is the Presi-
dent  of  Henry  S.  Cole  &  Associates,  an  environmental  consulting

an  oath?  No?  We  also  provide  that  you  may  be  represented  by

If  you  would  now  all  please  stand  and  raise  your  right  hand?  Do
you  swear  to  tell  the  truth  and  nothing  but  the  truth?  Let  the

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  RONNIE  D.  WILSON,  ASSOCIATE  PRO-
FESSOR,  CENTRAL  MICHIGAN  UNIVERSITY;  FORMER  OM-
BUDSMAN,  AGENCY  FOR  TOXIC  SUBSTANCES  AND  DISEASE
REGISTRY
Dr. WILSON. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for the invitation
to  speak  with  your  committee  regarding  ATSDR.  I  am  retired  now
from  the  government  and  the  Army  Reserves,  and  I  am  an  Asso-
ciate  Professor  at  Central  Michigan  University.  I  hold  a  degree  in
journalism, a Juris Doctorate, and a Masters of Science in Adminis-
tration in Health Services.

I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  quality  science  products  devel-
oped by the professionals within ATSDR who serve the public well
in  developing  toxicological  profiles,  health  education,  health  stud-
ies,  emergency  response,  and  public  health  assessments.  However,
as my testimony will describe, there are serious problems with and
within the Agency.

After  serving  as  the  Regional  Ombudsman  and  in  enforcement
and public affairs role for 23 and a half years with EPA, I became
the ATSDR Ombudsman. I was selected to build a neutral force to
serve the public in their need to be heard.

In 1999, citizens in Tarpon Springs, Florida, asked me to review
whether  an  appropriate  health  assessment  had  been  conducted  at
the Stauffer Chemical Company site. The site had been found to be
a public health hazard. The company and community were so hard-
ened in their stance that there was no way to find mutual grounds
for  an  agreement.  So  after  a  year  of  investigating,  I  published  a
196-page  report,  gathering  evidence  which  the  company,  the  state
and ATSDR had never seen. I found that the public health had not
been properly studied, and the use of asbestos in vast amounts had
not been considered.

After my report was issued, ATSDR moved quickly to review the
health  of  the  community  and  the  former  workers,  finding  and  a
spike of mesothelioma in women who had lived near the plant and
the workers who had likely had their health compromised.

This  report  is  used  to  point  out  some  issues  within  ATSDR.
ATSDR was a wonderful idea, a group of scientists who were inde-
pendent  of  EPA  to  look  at  the  public  health  around  hazardous
waste  and  other  kinds  of  hazardous  substance  release  sites.  How-
ever, the Agency was never fully staffed or funded and was admin-
istratively tethered to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, yoking two agencies with different missions. The State’s abili-
ties to dictate the Agency’s ability to assess the heath of the public
was detrimental.

I  questioned  the  author  of  the  original  Stauffer  Site  Public
Health  Assessment,  a  State  employee,  who  produced  the  report
pursuant to a cooperative agreement. He drafted the report to meet

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00268 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

261

the requirements of the state being paid but without looking at the
details. He was busy on another site with public and press interest.
In  gathering  materials  for  the  Stauffer  report,  I  asked  the  state
for  information  about  former  employees.  Although  the  public  had
been  given  the  data,  upon  advice  of  the  Florida  General  Counsel,
the state would not provide the data to me. I asked if ATSDR had
the  authority  to  issue  letters  commanding  the  production  of  infor-
mation  under  section  104(e)  of  the  Superfund  legislation.  No  one
knew  the  answer.  The  CDC  General  Counsel’s  office  advised  that
the  authority  did  exist  and  that  a  presentation  had  been  made  in
1989 regarding the tool.

A  104(e)  policy  was  drafted,  went  to  the  CDC  General  Counsel
for review and died because ATSDR was not an enforcement agen-
cy. With no policy, the Agency remains unprepared to command the
production of data needed to properly assess the public’s health.

ATSDR  is  a  dichotomy.  In  one  world  are  the  well-run  divisions
of  the  public  health,  toxicology  and  education,  and  I  seldom  ever
heard  a  complaint  about  those.  Then  there  was  the  Division  of
Health Assessment and Consultation, or DHAC, the largest portion
of the Agency, a ‘‘fiefdom’’ managed with an iron fist.

Talented,  dedicated  professionals  in  DHAC  were  not  to  listen  to
the public and could not get products to completion. DHAC leader-
ship delayed the completion of Health Assessments until they were
worded  exactly  the  way  leadership  felt  things  should  be,  not  the
way they were. The Division’s science officer sought to develop new
science to be applied by the assessors, ignoring the established lev-
els of the Division of Toxicology and other science agencies.

One  Division  leader  became  concerned  about  this  delay  and  de-
veloped  a  spread  sheet  to  analyze  the  days  that  it  took  to  get  a
completed public health assessment that was, on average, well over
400 days.

DHAC employees also informed me of the large number of health
assessments  that  were  developed  at  the  beginning  stages  of  the
Agency.  The  public’s  health  at  this  large  number  of  sites  was  as-
sessed  by  applying  a  basic  template,  documents  called  interim  or
temporary  assessments.  Most  of  these  documents  have  never  been
revisited or simply received a permanent cover.

DHAC  Leadership  presented  a  beautiful  picture  to  the  Agency
executives  but  the  public  revealed  a  different  story.  This  conflict
led  executives  to  the  development  of  an  Ombudsman  program,  a
mechanism to provide the public a voice and a hearing.

The Stauffer report highlights an effective Ombudsman program.
The  public  then  had  a  neutral  person  they  could  call  with  their
complaints.  By  the  end  of  fiscal  year  2005,  the  public  complaints
to the Ombudsman had dropped as the Agency had begun to actu-
ally  include  the  citizens  in  that  decision-making  process.  However,
this favorable report soon ended as the program ceased to exist.

If Congress wishes to impact the health of persons living near or
at  hazardous  waste  sites,  reorganize  ATSDR.  My  suggestions  sim-
ply are: legislate a merger for ATSDR and the National Center for
Environmental  Health,  or  dictate  the  separation  of  the  two.  Make
the  Agency  independent  of  CDC.  Dictate  the  establishment  of  a
permanent,  independent  Ombudsman  office  for  ATSDR  and  CDC.
Restrict  the  use  of  cooperative  agreements  with  states  to  hire  con-

ports.

This concludes my remarks, and I will be happy to answer ques-

tions at the end of the session.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RONNIE D. WILSON

Thank you for your invitation to speak with the Committee regarding ATSDR.
I am retired from the government and the Army Reserves and I am an Associate

sheet to analyze the number of days taken to complete a health assessment, an av-
erage of more than 400 days.

DHAC employees informed me of the large number of Health Assessments devel-
oped at the beginning stages of the Agency. The Public’s health at this large number
of  sites  was  assessed  by  the  application  of  basic  template  and  documents  called  in-

Health, or dictate the separation of the two entities.

• Make the Agency independent of CDC.
• Dictate  the  establishment  of  permanent,  independent  Ombudsman  offices  for

CDC and ATSDR, and

• Restrict  the  use  of  cooperative  agreements  with  states  as  a  tool  to  hire  con-

tractor and dictate the recovery of funding not properly earned.

This  concludes  my  remarks.  Thank  you  for  your  time  and  consideration  of  the
public and the professionals at ATSDR. I would be happy to answer your questions.

son  to  the  full-time  staff  in  2005  after  a  33.5-year  career  with  the  Federal  Govern-
ment.

While  on  loan  from  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry
(ATSDR), Dr. Wilson served as the Executive Director of the Delta Regional Author-
ity,  a  federal/State  partnership  seeking  to  improve  the  lives  of  10  million  people  in
eight states along the Mississippi River.

Prior to working with the Delta Regional Authority, Dr. Wilson’s most recent posi-
tion  was  Ombudsman  for  the  federal  agency  that  conducts  health  studies  around
hazardous waste sites. In that role he spent more than a year investigating a waste
site  in  Florida  and  produced  a  196-page  report  to  Congress  and  the  head  of  the
ATSDR. He was given an award by the Florida Sierra Club for his effort to protect
the public health and the environment in Florida.

Dr. Wilson came to the ATSDR after more than 23 years with the Environmental
Protection  Agency  (EPA).  At  EPA  he  served  in  a  variety  of  roles,  including  that  of
Regional Ombudsman.

On  a  volunteer  basis,  Dr.  Wilson  served  as  the  National  Vice  President  of  the
Spina Bifida Association of America for two years, as a National Board member for
five years.

As an Army Reserve officer, he is the holder of three Meritorious Service Medals,
and  a  Humanitarian  Service  Medal  and  he  commanded  an  Army  History  Detach-
ment. He holds a BS degree in Journalism from Arkansas State University, a Juris
Doctorate from Woodrow Wilson College of Law and a Master’s of Science in Admin-
istration, Health Services, from Central Michigan University.

Chair MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Wilson. Dr. Ozonoff.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  DAVID  OZONOFF,  PROFESSOR  OF  ENVI-
RONMENTAL  HEALTH,  BOSTON  UNIVERSITY  SCHOOL  OF
PUBLIC HEALTH
Dr.  OZONOFF.  Thank  you,  Chair  Miller,  Dr.  Broun.  My  name  is
David  Ozonoff.  I  am  a  physician  and  Professor  of  Environmental
Health  at  Boston  University  School  of  Public  Health,  and  by  trade
over the last 30, 40 years, I am a cancer epidemiologist. At Boston
University I was the founding Chair of the department that teach-
es and researches the effects of chemicals on health, a department
which I led for 26 years and where I continue to work as a full pro-
fessor  directing  a  multi-million  dollar  research  program  on  health
and  the  environmental  effects  of  chemicals,  funded  by  NIH.  I  am
therefore  intimately  familiar  with  the  underlying  science  which  is
beneath  ATSDR’s  work,  and  I  know  its  formidable  technical  dif-
ficulty well.

In  1991,  Congress  asked  the  GAO  to  examine  how  well  ATSDR
was  performing  those  public  health  evaluations  around  Superfund
sites  that  were  required  by  the  1986  SARA  legislation,  and  I  was
a  member  of  the  GAO  expert  panel  whose  judgments  formed  the
basis  for  the  report’s  main  findings.  Those  findings  concluded  that
ATSDR health assessments required more time and care and better
consideration  of  community  health  concerns,  that  there  should  be
independent  peer  review  of  the  assessments,  that  the  contents  of
the  assessments  were  redundant  of  EPA  reports  and  not  useful  to
EPA or the community, and that the assessments were incomplete
and not reliable for indicating when follow-up studies were needed.
Because  of  our  relationship  in  the  department,  we  worked  there
for many years, decades in fact, with community groups around the
country,  essentially  one  of  the  few  if  not  the  only  academic  unit
who did that. During that same period of the GAO report, we were
engaged  by  ATSDR  via  a  cooperative  agreement  to  assist  them  in
community  involvement  activities  around  several  federal  facilities.
In  the  course  of  that  work,  we  met  frequently  with  community
members,  both  with  and  without  ATSDR  at  community  sites.  Our
assistance  was  requested  by  ATSDR  because  of  persistent  com-
plaints. These are complaints that go back to the very inception of
the  active  work  of  the  Agency  in  1986,  that  public  health  assess-
ments  were  flawed,  unhelpful,  and/or  misleading.  A  common  view
was  that  somebody  else  had  already  shot  the  arrow,  and  ATSDR
was dutifully painting the target around it.

To  prepare  for  my  appearance  today  and  to  get  as  objective  a
view as I could, I made a number of calls to people both in the en-
vironmental health professions and those connected in communities
with toxic problems to see what has changed since that experience.
The bottom line is this: not very much. The health assessments are
somewhat  better  on  average  than  the  earliest  years,  but  they  re-
main  extremely  uneven.  Some  are  unsatisfactory.  The  Vieques  ex-
ample,  mentioned  earlier  by  Mr.  Grayson,  is  a  notorious  example
whose  reputation  is  now  rebounding  around  the  environmental
health community.

Recent  ones  that  I  have  seen  are  incomplete.  They  give  insuffi-
cient weight to the most up-to-date human information, and maybe
because I am in epidemiology, I am sensitive about this subject, but
they  do  not  pay  sufficient  attention  to  epidemiology.  And  although

the  focus  of  the  public  health  assessment  is  rightfully  on  current
potential exposures, the reports often do a less-than-satisfactory job
of  characterizing  at  least  as  well  as  they  can  past  potential  expo-
sures.  Reports  are  difficult  to  read  for  community  members,  and
they have a one-size-fits-all format which doesn’t convey the feeling
that the special concerns of the community have been heard or un-
derstood.

And  while  ATSDR  provides  a  short  public  comment  period,  the
health  assessment  documents  desperately  need  independent  peer
review  from  independent  experts.  At  the  very  least  the  reports
have a tendency to miss the most current information or adopt low-
est  common  denominator  judgments  when  evidence  conflicts.  And
in addition, there is insufficient breadth and depth of technical ex-
pertise  among  the  health  assessors.  These  are  a  handful  of  people
at  each  site  and  with  each  health  assessment  who  are  required  to
know  sciences  as  disparate  as  hydrogeology,  meteorology,  architec-
ture,  industrial  hygiene,  toxicology,  epidemiology,  sociology,  social
psychology  just  to  name  a  few.  And  as  good  as  some  of  them  are
and  as  truly  dreadful  as  some  others  are,  this  is  almost  an  impos-
sible task for one or a few people responsible for drafting the aver-
age health assessment.

And not all health assessments are done by ATSDR staff. A seri-
ous  problem  is  that  a  number  of  states,  in  fact,  almost  half  of  the
states  I  believe,  do  ATSDR  health  assessments  under  cooperative
agreement,  a  practice  which  carries  with  it  substantial  risk  which
we’ve  seen,  realized  any  number  of  times,  that  State-based  pres-
sures are going to affect the results.

I have made several concrete suggestions about what to do in my

written testimony as well as some more general observations.

So  to  conclude,  I  would  like  to  just  answer  a  question  that  you
asked  me  via  letter  about  my  net  opinion  about  whether  ATSDR
is  meeting  its  mission.  In  my  own  view  and  the  view  of  most  com-
munity  members  I  consulted,  the  routine  work  of  ATSDR  remains
deeply disappointing. I say remains because this is not a new situa-
tion, as you have heard. And at the core of it is a deep lost of trust
from  the  communities  that  ATSDR  is  supposed  to  serve.  Despite
this, I remain strongly of the view that it is vitally important that
there continue to be an agency whose job it is to look at community
chemical  exposures  from  the  public  health  viewpoint.  EPA  is  pri-
marily a regulatory agency. It is ATSDR’s job to ensure that public
health  activities  are  effective.  To  do  this,  it  needs  the  support  and
trust  of  the  public  to  conduct  studies  and  to  recommend  actions
that  are  focused  solely  on  protecting  public  health.  Public  health
has the word public in it, and the public indeed should be the main
focus of ATSDR’s activities.

In the context of the enormous problems that we face today that
are  in  the  news  every  day,  ATSDR’s  problems  probably  seem
minor,  and  in  terms  of  cost,  they  are  essentially  trivial  compared
to  the  sums  that  are  being  discussed  daily.  But  for  the  affected
communities, they are far from trivial. In some cases, they are mat-
ters  of  life,  death,  and  certainly  the  happiness  of  people  in  those
communities.

In 30 or 40 years of observing this, one of the things that I have
seen  is  that  chemical  contamination  doesn’t  just  take  lives,  as  ter-

rible  as  that  is,  and  as  a  physician,  that  causes  me  great  pain  to
see.  But  in  addition  to  that  it  also  wrecks  lives,  something  that  I
have  seen  all  too  often.  I  would  be  glad  to  answer  questions  after
the panel has made their statements. And I thank you for your in-
terest in this urgent matter.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Ozonoff follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID OZONOFF

Chairman  Miller,  Member  Broun  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  My  name
is  David  Ozonoff.  I  am  a  physician  and  Professor  of  Environmental  Health  in  the
Department  of  Environmental  Health  at  the  Boston  University  School  of  Public
Health.  I  was  the  founding  Chair  of  the  Department  that  teaches  and  researches
the effects of chemicals on health, a Department which I led for 26 years. I continue
at  Boston  University  as  a  full  Professor  where  I  direct  a  multi-million  dollar  re-
search  program  on  the  health  and  environmental  effects  of  chemicals,  funded  by
NIH.

By way of background, I received my undergraduate degree in mathematics from
the  University  of  Wisconsin  in  1962,  my  MD  degree  from  Cornell  in  1967  and  my
Master  of  Public  Health  degree  from  Johns  Hopkins  School  of  Hygiene  and  Public
Health (now the Bloomberg School) in 1968. I spent the first ten years of my career
at  MIT,  where  I  taught  and  did  research,  before  moving  to  Boston  University  in
1977.  The  Department  I  founded  there  had  as  its  focus  understanding  the  health
effects  of  chemicals  on  communities.  We  were  then,  and  remain  today,  30  years
later, one of the few academic units specializing in this subject. Most investigations
of community health effects are carried out in the public sector by State and federal
agencies,  one  of  which  is  ATSDR.  In  most  of  our  research  and  technical  assistance
we have worked closely with communities and while this helped me to see the prob-
lem from their perspective, I am also intimately familiar with the underlying science
and its formidable technical difficulty. I know quite well that judgments that appear
straightforward on the surface are anything but.

Difficult  as  such  work  may  be,  there  have  been  persistent  problems  with  how
ATSDR  carries  it  out.  In  1991  Congress  asked  the  GAO  to  examine  how  well
ATSDR  was  performing  the  public  health  evaluations  around  superfund  sites  re-
quired by the 1986 SARA legislation. Public health assessments are meant to deter-
mine if hazardous waste sites were causing harmful exposures to surrounding com-
munities  and,  if  so,  whether  these  exposures  should  be  stopped  or  reduced.  I  was
a  member  of  the  GAO  expert  panel  whose  judgments  formed  the  basis  for  the  re-
port’s  main  findings.  The  GAO  concluded  that  ATSDR  health  assessments  required
more time and care on the technical aspects and better consideration of community
health  concerns;  that  there  should  be  independent  peer  review  of  the  assessments;
that  the  contents  of  the  assessments  were  redundant  of  EPA  efforts  and  not  useful
to  EPA  or  the  community;  and  that  the  assessments  were  incomplete  and  not  reli-
able  for  indicating  when  follow-up  studies  were  needed.  A  number  of  recommenda-
tions were made, including that Congress should check back later on progress. I see
this hearing as fulfilling that recommendation.

Because  of  our  relationship  and  reputation  working  with  communities,  in  the
1990s  we  were  engaged  by  ATSDR  via  a  Cooperative  Agreement  to  assist  them  in
community  involvement  activities  around  several  federal  facilities.  In  the  course  of
that  work  we  met  frequently  with  community  members  at  community  sites.  Dr.
Cole,  the  next  panelist,  helped  us  with  some  of  that  work.  Our  assistance  was  re-
quested because there continued to be persistent complaints from communities that
ATSDR’s  public  health  assessments  were  flawed,  unhelpful  or  misleading.  A  com-
mon  view  was  that  someone  had  already  shot  the  arrow  and  ATSDR  was  dutifully
painting the target around it.

As a result of this background I have seen the problem from several different per-
spectives, an experience which surely tempers my judgments. I think I have a good
feeling  for  what  it  is  like  to  be  in  ATSDR’s  shoes,  always  useful  for  fairness.  I  also
have  the  advantage  of  distance  from  the  immediate  fray.  As  my  Department  grew,
my  research  group  expanded  greatly  and  other  problems  began  to  claim  my  atten-
tion. As a result I have spent considerably less time in recent years with either the
communities served by ATSDR or the Agency itself. I remain close to many commu-
nity activists and their leaders for whom ATSDR represents, at the least, a serious
problem.  I  have  the  greatest  respect  for  these  residents  and  activists  and  for  their
dedication  to  making  their  communities  safer  for  themselves,  their  families  and
their neighbors. The toll this takes on them is very large and their stories are heart
wrenching. I am not just a scientist but I am a spouse, a father and a grandfather,

and  it  takes  little  imagination  for  me  to  identify  with  their  concerns.  I  also  know
many  of  the  principal  players  from  both  the  early  days  of  ATSDR  and  the  current
leadership.  To  prepare  for  my  appearance  today  and  to  get  as  objective  a  view  as
I could, I made a number of calls to people, both in the environmental health profes-
sion  and  those  connected  to  communities  with  toxics  problems,  to  see  what  has
changed in recent years.

The bottom line is this: not very much. The health assessments are better on av-
erage than in the early years but their quality remains uneven and some are unsat-
isfactory. Some of the recent ones I have seen are incomplete and do not give suffi-
cient weight to the most up-to-date human information, tending to de-emphasize ep-
idemiology while spending disproportionate time on toxicology and animal evidence.
Often  much  of  the  detail  involves  exposure  analysis,  a  function  of  at  least  three
things:  the  experience  and  training  of  many  of  the  health  assessors  is  more  in  the
area  of  Earth  science  and  engineering;  site-specific  detail  is  available  from  parallel
EPA efforts; and the lack of experience and training that makes assessors more de-
pendent  on  summary  statements  like  ATSDR  toxicology  profiles  and  fact  sheets,  a
number  of  which  are  dated  or  even  obsolete.  And  although  the  focus  of  the  public
health assessments is rightfully on current potential exposures, the reports often do
a  less  than  satisfactory  job  characterizing  (or  addressing  as  well  as  they  can)  past
potential  exposures.  Finally,  the  reports  are  difficult  to  read  for  community  mem-
bers and have a one-size-fits-all feel which does not convey the feeling that the spe-
cial concerns of the community have been heard and understood.

While  ATSDR  provides  a  short  public  comment  period  on  its  reports,  the  health
assessment documents need independent peer review from experts. At the very least
the  reports  have  a  tendency  to  miss  the  most  current  information  or  adopt  lowest
common denominator judgments when evidence conflicts. In addition, there is insuf-
ficient breadth and depth of technical expertise among the health assessors who are
required  to  know  sciences  as  disparate  as  hydrogeology,  meteorology,  architecture,
industrial  hygiene,  toxicology,  epidemiology,  social  psychology  and  sociology,  to
name  a  few.  As  good  as  some  of  them  are  (or  as  inadequate  as  are  others),  this  is
almost  an  impossible  task  for  the  one  or  a  few  people  responsible  for  drafting  the
average  health  assessment.  There  also  needs  to  be  a  full  review  of  ATSDR  Fact
Sheets  used  for  public  education  for  relevance  to  the  concerns  of  communities  and
their overall usefulness and appropriateness in specific situations.

Not all health assessments are done by ATSDR staff. The Agency out-sources the
health  assessment  task  to  a  number  of  states  under  Cooperative  Agreements.  This
practice  is  beneficial  for  building  capacity  in  cash  strapped  State  health  depart-
ments but carries with it the risk that local pressures from the Governor’s office or
the  legislature  will  affect  the  result.  ATSDR  is  not  immune  to  these  State-based
pressures but they are more distant and ATSDR has a greater chance of independ-
ence.  I  have  written  about  this  problem  in  the  past  and  ask  that  our  paper  on  the
subject be appended to this testimony.

In  summary,  I  would  repeat  and  add  to  some  of  the  recommendations  we  made

in 1991, including:

ATSDR health assessments, consultations and studies.

• an  effective  arrangement  for  independent  and  timely  expert  peer  review  of
• an  across  the  board  review  of  the  fact  sheets  and  recommendations  ATSDR
is  giving  to  communities  for  relevancy  to  their  concerns.  It  is  not  uncommon
for a community to be told by ATSDR there is no hazard and then to be given
advice  they  should  wash  their  hands  and  take  off  their  shoes  after  being  in
a contaminated outdoor environment.

• an increase in the breadth of scientific talent recruited by the Agency.
• a  re-evaluation  of  the  practice  of  out-sourcing  work  to  State  health  depart-
ments. Perhaps regional style consultation units, based at universities, would
be useful.

Finally, you have specifically asked me to give my opinion about whether ATSDR
is  meeting  its  mission.  Let  me  try  to  answer  the  question  by  giving  you  my  own
view  and  the  view  of  most  community  members  I  consulted.  It  is  this.  The  routine
work  of  ATSDR  remains  deeply  disappointing.  ATSDR  has  acquired,  partly  on  its
own,  partly  for  reasons  beyond  its  control,  a  reputation  with  communities  it  will
have  a  difficult  time  remedying.  It  is  not  alone  in  the  government  in  being  a  deep
disappointment. But it is the disappointment we are here to talk about today.

Disappointment  is  relative  to  what  one  expects.  One  way  to  think  about  this  is
on  the  doctor–patient  model.  A  patient  with  health  concerns  or  complaints  expects
a  doctor  to  listen,  to  hear  and  interpret  beyond  what’s  being  said,  and  to  be  com-
petent—or  at  least  competent  enough  so  the  patient  will  not  be  able  to  see  obvious

errors.  A  patient  also  expects  the  doctor  to  be  able  to  do  things  that  make  them
feel  more  comfortable  if  not  to  make  them  better.  The  most  damaging  thing  that
can  happen  to  the  doctor—patient  relationship  is  loss  of  trust  and  faith  by  the  pa-
tient. And that is what is at the core of the problem with ATSDR. If a doctor doesn’t
meet  basic  expectations  the  patient  will  look  for  another  doctor.  But  there  is  no
other  recourse  when  the  patient  is  a  neighborhood  and  the  doctor  is  ATSDR.  This
has produced a self-reinforcing feedback loop where ATSDR frankly admits their re-
luctance to hold public meetings because of the abuse they receive in these settings,
opting instead for one-on-one encounters. This is seen as a further withdrawal from
the organized community, which responds in kind, increasing the alienation.

This  is  a  difficult  situation.  But  I  am  strongly  of  the  view  that  it  remains  vitally
important that there continue to be an agency whose job it is to look at community
chemical  exposures  from  the  public  health  point  of  view.  EPA  is  primarily  an  envi-
ronmental regulatory agency, not a public health agency. Public health has the word
‘‘public’’  in  it,  which  implies  looking  at  the  situation  from  the  community’s  stand-
point. ATSDR was supposed to step into the gap.

There is no simple technical or legislative fix for what ails ATSDR. The problems
are problems of leadership at virtually every level. Presidents from Nixon to Obama
have  declared  we  must  make  an  effort  to  cure  cancer  in  our  lifetime.  For  those
whose  friends,  family  and  indeed  themselves  are  in  the  cancer  years,  this  appears
to us an important goal. But for my children and grandchildren’s sake, I would have
also liked to hear that we will prevent cancer in our lifetime. ATSDR depends upon
advances  in  basic  science  to  do  its  job  and  the  recent  stimulus  package  recognized
the importance of basic health science to our economy and the terrible cost of dread
disease  in  our  communities  by  injecting  badly  needed  resources  into  the  NIH.  In-
vestment in science pays off in many multiples. But left out entirely was money for
the science of preventing cancer and other diseases acquired in the environment and
workplace.  NIOSH  got  nothing,  which  means  it  will  get  less  again  this  year  than
last year. The NIH’s program for basic science underlying superfund, the Superfund
Basic Research Program, got nothing, which means it, too will shrink. CDC and its
Center  for  Environmental  Health  got  nothing.  CDC’s  only  stimulus  money  is  for
bricks  and  mortar  projects.  Bricks  and  mortar  don’t  prevent  cancer.  It  is  a  wry
adage in the public health community that no Senator champions an agency because
his wife didn’t get breast cancer or any Congressperson because her child was born
healthy. Much of essential public health and its importance remains invisible to the
public. Until this changes other things that need to change, like ATSDR, won’t.

I’m not talking about money here. The amount involved are almost lost in the ac-
counting  noise  among  the  sums  we  are  talking  of  these  days.  This  is  a  question  of
leadership.  The  unglamorous  parts  of  health  science,  the  parts  that  are  true  public
health infrastructure and upon which much else depends, like surveillance and vital
records,  things  ATSDR  depends  upon,  have  not  had  the  necessary  champions.  I  in-
clude those in the private sector, like myself and in Congress but also the Executive
Branch.  Indeed  the  Agency  needs  to  signal  to  you  in  Congress  what  must  be  done.
ATSDR  is  a  sister  agency  of  CDC,  but  the  CDC  administrator  did  not  visibly,  vo-
cally  or  strenuously  fight  for  it  or  even  her  own  agency,  publicly.  Whether  she
fought these battles internally I don’t know, but we needed visible and strong public
champions  for  public  health  and  we  didn’t  have  them.  We  had  a  skilled  communi-
cator but not a champion. Morale at CDC has dropped precipitously. That’s a leader-
ship question. Similarly, ATSDR needs not only the trust and confidence of the com-
munities  it  is  supposed  to  serve,  but  its  own  leadership  needs  the  trust  and  con-
fidence  of  the  many  dedicated  professionals  in  the  Agency  itself.  That’s  not  a  ques-
tion for legislation.

In the context of the enormous problems we face in the economy and foreign pol-
icy,  ATSDR’s  problems  seem  trivial,  and  in  terms  of  cost  they  are.  But  for  the  af-
fected communities, they are far from trivial. In some cases they are matters of life,
death  and  happiness.  If  pressed  hard  to  name  the  single  effect  of  living  in  a  con-
taminated community I see most consistently, it would be divorce. In a world where
the stresses on marriage are already large, the additional burden of worrying about
one’s  family  and  what  might  happen  to  them  or  coping  with  what  did  happen  to
a  child,  is  too  much  for  too  many.  Chemical  contamination  doesn’t  just  take  lives,
as terrible as that is. It can also wreck lives.

I  thank  you  for  your  attention  to  this  urgent  matter,  of  which  the  problems  at

ATSDR are real but only a part.

studying,  among  other  things,  the  psychophysical  difficulties  of  radiologists  when
reading  chest  x-rays.  He  and  his  colleagues  also  published  one  of  the  first  two-di-
mensional  x-ray  reconstructions  (CAT  scans)  in  the  literature  in  1969.  He  also
served  as  a  consultant  to  the  World  Health  Organization,  assisting  WHO  in  the
preparation  and  writing  of  its  contribution  to  the  first  International  Conference  on
the  Environment  which  took  place  in  Stockholm  in  1972.  In  1975  he  was  a  Macy
Fellow  in  the  History  of  Medicine  and  the  Biological  Sciences  at  Harvard,  and  in
1976 a Mellon Fellow in the History of Public Health at MIT.

In  1977  he  moved  to  the  Boston  University  School  of  Public  Health  and  in  1983
he  became  the  founding  Chair  of  the  Department  of  Environmental  Health,  a  posi-
tion  he  held  until  2003  when  he  became  Chair  Emeritus  He  is  Professor  of  Public
Health  at  Boston  University  School  of  Public  Health,  and  Professor  of  Sociomedical
Sciences  and  Community  Medicine  at  Boston  University  School  of  Medicine.  He  di-
rects  the  Superfund  Basic  Research  Program  at  Boston  University,  a  $17  million
dollar  multi-project  research  effort.  He  is  a  Fellow  of  the  Johns  Hopkins  Society  of
Scholars and a Fellow of the Collegium Ramazzini.

Dr.  Ozonoff’s  research  has  centered  on  epidemiological  studies  of  populations  ex-
posed  to  toxic  agents,  especially  the  development  of  new  methods  to  investigate
small  exposed  populations.  He  has  studied  populations  around  Superfund  sites  in
a number of places, most recently case control and cohort studies in the Upper Cape
region  of  Massachusetts.  Dr.  Ozonoff  frequently  serves  as  advisor  or  consultant  to
local, State and federal agencies on matters of health effects from hazardous wastes
and  contaminated  drinking  water.  He  chaired  the  Water  Systems  Security  Com-
mittee  of  the  National  Research  Council/National  Academies  of  Science  and  has
served on several other NRC panels. He is the author of numerous scientific articles
and  is  on  the  editorial  boards  of  the  Archives  of  Environmental  Health  and  the
American Journal of Industrial Medicine and is co-Editor-in-Chief of Environmental
Health, an Open Access international journal.

STATEMENT OF DR. HENRY S. COLE, PRESIDENT, HENRY S.
COLE & ASSOCIATES, INC., UPPER MARLBORO, MARYLAND
Dr. COLE. Thank you, Chair Miller and Dr. Broun and Members
of  the  Subcommittee  for  this  very  important  hearing.  I  am  Presi-
dent of Henry S. Cole & Associates, and it is an environmental con-
sulting  firm  which,  among  other  things,  provides  scientific  support
to numerous community organizations on environmental issues.

I  received  my  Ph.D.  in  meteorology  at  the  University  of  Wis-
consin  in  1969,  was  an  Associate  Professor  of  Environmental
Sciences  at  UW–Parkside  during  the  1970’s,  and  my  research  into
air  pollution  meteorology  led  to  my  appointment  to  the  Wisconsin
State  Air  Pollution  Council.  From  1977  to  1983  I  was  senior  sci-
entist  with  U.S.  EPA’s  Office  of  Air  Quality  Planning  and  Stand-
ards  where  my  work  focused  on  predicting  the  impact  of  source
emissions on ambient air. I am giving you this background because
it qualifies me to talk about the particular case that I am going to
talk  about  which  is  Perma-Fix,  a  facility  that  processes  hazardous
and industrial waste in Dayton, Ohio.

Another  thing  is  that  ATSDR  retained  me  as  a  consultant  from
1995  to  2003  to  investigate  the  Agency’s  community  involvement
practices and to work with the Agency’s Community and Tribal Ad-
visory  Committee.  The  purpose  of  that  work  was  to  help  them  im-
prove that program.

Since 2004, I have provided technical support to a Dayton, Ohio,
community  organization  affected  by  odors  and  emissions  from  an
industrial  waste  processing  plant  known  as  Perma-Fix.  For  years,
residents  of  surrounding  low-income  neighborhoods  complained  of
noxious odors. These complaints were confirmed by the regional air

pollution control agency which later issued a notice of violations to
Perma-Fix. Residents suspect that many illnesses are related to the
plant’s  emissions  including  nosebleeds,  respiratory  disease,  cardiac
disorders, birth defects, and many other symptoms.

In  2004,  ATSDR  responded  to  a  community  petition  and  agreed
to  do  a  health  consultation  on  this  case.  The  consultation  was
based  on  a  monitoring  study  of  chemicals  in  community  air.  The
consultation  published  in  December  2008  found  that  none  of  the
chemicals tested were above levels of concern, and that information
on  Perma-Fix’s  waste  and  processes  did  not  reveal  an  obvious
source  for  the  observed  odors.  I  want  to  emphasize  those  two  find-
ings.

As  a  scientist  with  experience  in  air  pollution  meteorology,  I
found that the limited number of days sampled, only six days sam-
pled,  is  insufficient  to  give  an  accurate  representation  of  long-  or
short-term concentrations. The waste process emissions and weath-
er  all  vary  from  day  to  day,  requiring  a  far  more  robust  sampling
plan.  In  addition,  the  consultation  also  failed  to  consider  the  addi-
tive  effects  of  pollutants  and  the  fact  that  the  area  is  non-attain-
ment for ozone and inhalable particulates. Moreover, ATSDR failed
to  measure  or  obtain  information  on  the  plant’s  emission  rates  or
to conduct air quality monitoring.

It  gets  worse.  In  May  2006,  the  U.S.  Government  sued  Perma-
Fix for its violations of the Clean Air Act. The complaint identifies
Perma-Fix  as  a  major  source  of  hazardous  air  pollutions  and  cites
numerous  failures  to  control  emission  sources.  The  resulting  con-
sent  order  included  a  stiff  fine  and  requirements  to  control  emis-
sions. The court docket contains detailed information on the plant’s
emission  sources,  and  ATSDR  officials  declined  to  use  this  data
readily  available  online  despite  pleas  from  the  community.  They
declined  to  use  government  information,  detailed  information,  on
sources  in  coming  to  its  conclusion.  I  feel  that  that  is  unconscion-
able.  To  find  no  obvious  source  for  the  odors,  given  that  kind  of
record, is absolutely unconscionable.

The  Agency’s  sole  recommendation  asking  Perma-Fix  to  volun-
tarily  control  solvent  releases  could  have  been  made  back  in  2004
without  doing  a  flawed  and  predictably  inconclusive  monitoring
study.  It  makes  me  so  frustrated  I  can’t  get  the  word  out.  Resi-
dents  were  so  frustrated  that  in  July  2007  they  petitioned  the
Agency  once  again,  this  time  to  halt  all  of  its  work  on  Perma-Fix
unless  the  Agency  negotiated  a  protocol  and  process  acceptable  to
the community. They never did that.

Let  me  just  say  in  concluding  that  I,  too,  poll  communities  that
I  have  worked  with,  and  this  agency  has  no  trust.  In  fact,  if  you
look  at  the  agencies  that  communicate  with  networks,  they  advise
communities to be very cautious about cooperating with ATSDR be-
cause  of  these  inconclusive  studies,  and  many  groups  feel  that
there  is  more  harm  done  than  good.  The  reason  for  that  is  that  if
a  conclusion  is  inconclusive,  that  quickly  gets  translated  to  mean
there  is  no  problem.  No  evidence  is  equated  with  no  problem,  and
that  is  used  as  an  excuse  for  inaction.  It  may  have  even  damaged
the  government’s  case.  If  this  health  consultation  had  come  out
prior  to  the  consent  degree  in  this  case,  it  may  have  damaged  the

271

case.  So  one  has  to  wonder  about  an  agency  and  whether  they  are
fulfilling their mission.

Finally,  what  has  to  be  done?  I  think  the  proverb  behind  you  is
very  telling.  It  says,  ‘‘Where  there  is  no  vision,  the  people  perish,’’
Proverbs  29:18.  This  agency  has  lost  its  vision,  especially  in  its
dealings  with  communities,  and  I  think  that  the  first  thing  that
has to be done is to take a close look at the leadership of the Agen-
cy and maybe what is needed is a fresh start. Thank you.

1.0 Introduction:

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HENRY S. COLE

First, let me thank Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Broun and the other Mem-
bers  of  the  Subcommittee  for  the  opportunity  to  present  my  views  on  the  future  of
ATSDR.

By  way  of  introduction,  I  am  President  of  Henry  S.  Cole  &  Associates,  Incor-
porated, a Washington, DC area-based environmental consulting company now in its
16th  year.  I  received  my  Ph.D.  in  atmospheric  sciences  at  the  University  of  Wis-
consin in 1969. My career in atmospheric and environmental sciences is approaching
the 40-year mark. During the 1970’s, I served as an Associate Professor of environ-
mental Earth sciences at the University of Wisconsin–Parkside and conducted a re-
search  project  involving  air  pollution  meteorology.  From  1977–1983,  I  then  served
as  senior  scientist  with  U.S.  EPA’s  Office  of  Air  Quality  Planning  and  Standards
and Chief of the Modeling Application Section. This section focused on the relation-
ship  between  sources,  emissions,  weather  conditions  and  ambient  concentrations.
From 1983–1993, I served as Science Director of the Clean Water Fund.

My  consulting  firm,  founded  in  1993,  has  provided  scientific  research  and  tech-
nical advice to support the efforts of dozens of community-based organizations to im-
prove  the  environmental  health  and  sustainability  of  their  communities.  A  signifi-
cant  portion  of  my  work  has  been  funded  by  community-based  organizations  that
receive Superfund Technical Assistant Grants (TAGs) from U.S. EPA. Other clients
have  included  neighborhood  associations,  State  and  national  environmental  organi-
zations  and  local  governments.  ATSDR  conducted  public  health  assessments  and
consultations  in  a  number  of  these  communities.  An  additional  line  of  work  is  sci-
entific support for companies with technologies that are more sustainable than mar-
ket standards.

From  1994  to  2003,  I  served  as  a  consultant  to  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances
and  Disease  Registry  (ATSDR)  in  order  to  help  the  Agency  improve  its  community
involvement  programs  and  practices.  In  this  capacity  I  provided  advice  to  former
Administrator Barry Johnson and prepared a report based on case studies of numer-
ous  communities  where  ATSDR  provided  health  assessments  or  studies.  Finally  I
served  as  an  advisor  to  the  Agency’s  ‘‘Community  and  Tribal  Subcommittee.’’  The
subcommittee  included  leaders  of  communities  and  tribes  in  which  ATSDR  had
worked.  For  additional  details  see  attached  CV  and  www.hcole-environmental.com.

2.0 Is ATSDR Fulfilling It’s Mission?

ATSDR describes it mission in the following way:

ATSDR’s  mission  is  to  serve  the  public  by  using  the  best  science,  taking  respon-
sive  public  health  actions,  and  providing  trusted  health  information  to  prevent
harmful exposures and disease related exposures to toxic substances.

The  Oversight  Subcommittee  has  performed  a  great  service  by  examining
ATSDR’s handling of the FEMA trailers cased in which hundreds of Katrina victims
were exposed to formaldehyde. The Subcommittee report demonstrates that ATSDR
was  negligent  in  the  conduct  of  its  duty.  In  its  efforts  to  play  down  the  dangers,
the Agency exercised a callous disregard for both science and for the health of those
exposed in the trailers.

In my experience, however, the FEMA trailer case is not an isolated case where the
Agency  has  failed  to  live  up  to  its  mission.  Unfortunately,  the  Agency’s  performance
in a substantial number of communities has undermined its most valuable commod-
ities,  the  ability  to  provide  ‘‘trusted  health  information’’  and  the  ability  to  ‘‘prevent
harmful exposures’’ and their effects.

I  believe  that  the  Agency  has  improved  the  overall  quality  of  its  Public  Health
Assessments1 and  community  involvement  programs  since  the  early  1990s.2 How-
ever,  the  Agency  will  have  to  make  some  monumental  changes  in  the  conduct  of
science  and  in  its  relationship  to  communities  to  warrant  its  continued  use  of  tax
payer  dollars.  Such  changes  will  require  real  leadership  and  a  rededication  to
science and public health even when the evidence requires expensive corrective meas-
ures  and  opposition  by  federal  agencies  or  by  business.  Moreover,  uncertainty  is  not
an excuse to play down community concerns, but to dig further and to err on the side
of caution.

3.0 ATSDR’s Perma-Fix Health Consultation:

Today,  I  will  focus  on  a  very  recent  example,  of  an  ATSDR  Health  Consultation
that  has  failed  the  Agency’s  mission—a  consultation  dealing  with  a  Dayton,  Ohio
community  affected  by  a  plant  in  their  midst  that  processes  industrial  and  haz-
ardous wastewaters, sludges and oils. The company is Perma-Fix of Dayton (PFD).3
My  association  with  this  case  included  technical  consultation  to  the  Dayton  Legal
Aid Society in 2004 and pro-bono advice to community leaders.

Let’s  imagine  for  the  moment  that  you  live  in  this  community,  know  as  Drexel.
Your homes and those of your neighbors are small. The community has experienced
economic  stress  for  years—not  just  lately.  You  have  complained  to  various  levels  of
government  for  years  about  the  frequent  and  sometimes  overpowering  odors  that
occur when Perma-Fix is processing waste. These odors often make doing something
out  of  doors  intolerable  and  when  you  get  upset  enough  you  call  the  Regional  Air
Pollution  Control  Agency.  Although  RAPCA  inspectors  have  confirmed  the  validity
and intensity of complaints for many, the problem continues unabated. You also sus-
pect  that  a  high  incidence  of  health  problems  has  something  to  do  with  emissions
from this plant.4

Then,  in  2003,  your  neighborhood  group  hears  about  ATSDR,  that  it’s  a  govern-
ment agency that can help environmentally stressed communities with various stud-
ies.  Agency  officials  respond  to  a  call  from  the  group  and  your  visit  the  community
and appear to be friendly and sympathetic. They tell you how to petition the Agency
and with hopes high your community group does so.

Now lets take a look at what actually happened.

ATSDR  accepted  the  community  petition  and  agreed  to  do  a  Health  Consultation
in March 2004 based on an Exposure Investigation. The purpose of the investigation
was  to  determine  whether  volatile  emissions  from  Perma-Fix  (PFD)  were  exposing
residents to harmful levels of any of 100 chemical species tested. To do this ATSDR
conducted  an  air  monitoring  program  in  the  neighborhoods  surrounding  the  plant.
The  number  of  days  utilized  in  the  investigation  was  extremely  low;  only  six  days
during the 13-month period from June 2007–June 2008.

More than four years after the petition, ATSDR published its Health Consultation
document just this past December (2008). The principal findings of the Health Con-
sultation on PFD are listed below:

• Although  the  data  only  represent  ambient  air  concentrations  during  the  time
of  sampling,  none  of  the  more  than  100  compounds  analyzed  were  detected
over health-based values.

1 Under  cooperative  agreements,  Public  Health  Assessments  are  often  conducted  by  State
Health Departments. I recently reviewed the Ohio Department of Health/ATSDR assessment on
the  Armco-Hamilton  Site  in  Ohio  (former  steel  mill  and  coke  ovens  along  the  Great  Miami
River).  In  my  judgment,  this  assessment  did  a  reasonably  good  job  in  scoping  out  the  informa-
tion existing and referred to U.S. Geological Survey documents which described the vulnerability
of  groundwater  to  contamination  and  the  close  down-gradient  vicinity  of  the  Hamilton  North
municipal  well  field.  The  Health  Assessment  also  recommended  that  fish  be  tested  for  per-
sistent, bio-accumulative contaminants such as PCBs. See: Agency for Toxic Substances and Dis-
ease Registry (ATSDR), Public Health Assessment for Armco-Hamilton Plant, 2005.

2 For  example,  ATSDR  adopted  a  number  of  ideas  from  its  community  and  tribal  advisory
group,  including  the  initiation  of  health-related  Technical  Assistance  Grants,  which  allow  com-
munity  organizations  to  hire  independent  experts  to  serve  as  advisors  pertaining  to  health  as-
sessments and health studies.

4 According  to  the  Health  Consultation,  health-related  concerns  include  headaches,  nausea,
vomiting,  nose  bleeds,  numbness  in  legs  and  hands,  heart,  gastrointestinal  and  respiratory  dis-
orders, burning eyes, sore throats, unexplained rashes, premature births, and birth defects.

• ‘‘The  differences  between  the  average  concentrations  of  volatile  organic  com-
pounds  (VOCs)  for  downwind  and  upwind  samples  were  not  statistically  sig-
nificant. This lack of difference may be due to the small sample size.’’5

• ATSDR’s review of information on the wastes accepted and the treatment proc-
esses  used  by  PFD  did  not  reveal  an  obvious  source  for  the  observed  odors  in
the neighborhood.

• ATSDR’s  outdoor  air  sampling  revealed  one  compound,  ethyl  acetate—which
has  a  low  odor  threshold  and  the  characteristic  odor  of  fingernail  polish  re-
mover—may  be  the  source  of  the  reported  solvent-like  odors.  That  same  odor
was  observed  by  ATSDR  staff  while  touring  the  PFD  facility  and  was  most
noticeable in the filter press room and testing laboratory.

The sole recommendation found in the Health Consultation is as follows:

• ‘‘To  reduce  solvent-like  odors,  PFD  should  determine  if  there  is  a  source  of
ethyl  acetate  in  their  waste  streams  and  seek  to  eliminate  or  treat  it  if  it  is
present.’’

To  understand  why  community  members  were  frustrated  and  angry  we  need  to
look not only at study’s outcome (after four years) but also at several inter- related
problems  including  serious  deficiencies  in  the  Agency’s  science,  its  failure  to  utilize
critical information and its flawed community involvement process.

3.1 Inadequacies in the Exposure Investigation’s Monitoring Study
1. The number of sample days (six days over a 13-month period) was woefully inad-
equate, especially if they are attempting to look at health effects. Both emissions
and weather conditions vary—thus a much larger sample (days and locations) is
needed to capture the worst cases.6

2. The  kind  of  monitoring  study  conducted  by  ATSDR  should  have  been  supple-
mented  with  source  testing  and  air  quality  modeling.  ATSDR  officials  acknowl-
edged that it did not include source testing. Testing stack and fugitive emissions
could  have  given  the  Agency  much  better  information  on  the  chemicals  being
emitted from the plant.

3. Air  quality  modeling  can  estimate  the  distribution  of  concentrations  from  a
source  based  on  pollutant  emission  rates  and  multi-year  data  sets  on  weather
conditions. Although modeling has limitations, the combination of monitoring and
modeling provides better information than either alone.

4. Although, the report addresses wind speed and direction, it does not address the
stability  of  the  atmosphere  (e.g.,  the  presence  or  absence  of  temperature  inver-
sions). The combination of stable atmosphere with very slow wind speeds has the
potential  for  worst  case  conditions.  It  is  not  certain  whether  ATSDR’s  sampling
included  such  conditions.  Moreover,  as  the  Health  Consultation  acknowledges,
the  sample  collection  length  (from  two  to  eleven  hours)  would  not  provide  infor-
mation on peak concentrations of relatively short durations.

5. Samples  were  taken  and  analyzed  on  six  different  days.  However,  not  all  of  the
contaminants  were  analyzed  for  each  of  the  six  days.  Thus  the  study  may  have
failed to detect certain contaminants on some of the days.

3.2 Problems with the Health Consultation Process
1. Despite  repeated  requests,  the  protocol  was  not  provided  to  the  community  for
review  and  comment  before  the  study  was  initiated.  The  potential  deficiencies
could  have  been  discussed  in  advance  of  the  study  had  a  draft  been  provided  in
advance.  This  is  a  key  requirement  for  effective  and  respectful  public  involve-
ment.  The  Health  Consultation  does  not  include  a  response  to  citizen  concerns
and recommendations.

2. ATSDR failed to incorporate substantial information pertaining emissions includ-
ing  those  of  odors  and  hazardous  air  pollutants  (HAPs)  that  were  available  in
various  notices  of  government  violations  and  suits  filed  by  a  resident  and  regu-
latory agencies against Perma-Fix (PFD). These include:

5 ATSDR, Health Consultation, p. 13.
6 The document does not state whether or not the company was notified as to the timing of test-
ing  in  advance.  Prior  notification  would  have  allowed  the  company  to  take  preventive  actions
(e.g., not processing certain kinds of wastes) that are not normally employed.

274

• In  2002,  the  Regional  Air  Pollution  Control  Agency  (RAPCA)  issued  a  Notice
of  Violation  to  Perma-Fix  for  the  company’s  failure  to  comply  with  RAPCA’s
previous  orders  pertaining  to  odor  and  emissions  controls  from  a  number  of
sources within the plant.

• In  2005,  U.S.  EPA  filed  a  ‘‘Finding  of  Violation’’  in  regard  to  PFD’s  failure
to  control  a  variety  of  hazardous  air  pollution  (HAP)  emission  sources  regu-
lated under the Clean Air Act.

• In  May,  2006,  the  Justice  Department  in  2006,  on  behalf  of  U.S.  EPA  joined
the  suit  of  a  local  resident  for  injunctive  relief  and  civil  penalties  against
Perma-Fix for similar violations. The complaint again cited numerous failures
to  control  emissions,  e.g.,  the  plant’s  bio-plant  tanks  and  wastewater  treat-
ment plant and other sources. In addition, the company failed to keep records,
conduct testing, or apply and receive permits as required by regulations. (See
attached copy U.S. Justice Department complaint.)

• In  2007,  the  parties  to  the  2006  suit  entered  into  a  Consent  Decree  that  im-
posed  a  civil  penalty  of  $360,000  and  required  PDF  to  (a)  identify  sources  of
emissions  and  odors  (b)  measure  emissions  (c)  prevent  and  control  emissions
and odors and (d) obtain a Title V permit from U.S. EPA.

The  filings  associated  with  these  complaints  as  well  as  a  variety  of  documents
(e.g., reports by expert witnesses) were readily available to the Agency online.7 The
information  contained  in  these  sources  would  have  been  extremely  useful  to  ATSDR
in  its  design  of  the  monitoring  study  and  in  generating  a  meaningful  set  of  rec-
ommendations.  For  example,  one  memorandum  contained  in  the  docket  provides
specific  information  on  waste  streams  and  emission  sources.  I  am  also  aware  that
community leaders made numerous attempts to persuade ATSDR officials to obtain
and use this data. However, to my knowledge the Agency failed to do so; moreover,
the  Health  Consultation  is  mum  on  the  Agency  violations,  the  federal  and  citizen
litigation and the resulting Consent Decree. (See Attached Documents)

Residents  were  so  frustrated  with  ATSDR’s  handling  of  the  study,  that  in  July
2007  they  petitioned  the  Agency  once  again—this  time  to  ‘‘halt  all  of  its  work  re-
garding Perma-Fix until such time as it works out an acceptable protocol and public
involvement process with the affected community.’’ 8 A copy of this letter is attached.
In my judgment, it is unconscionable that the Agency failed to include in its Con-
sultation  (2008)  the  list  of  uncontrolled  emission  sources  in  the  record  and  the  ex-
tent which Perma-Fix was taking meaningful steps to meet the requirements of the
2007 Consent Decree. Instead, the Consultation’s sole recommendation is of no real
consequence or utility. Moreover, it could have been made back in 2004 without ex-
pending  funds  for  a  predictably  inconclusive  monitoring  study.  Most  importantly,
the  tepid  recommendation  coupled  with  the  implied  finding  that  there  is  ‘‘no  evi-
dence  for  concern’’  can  be  readily  translated  to  signify,  ‘‘no  cause  for  concern.’’  Had
this  report  been  issued  earlier,  it  might  have  been  used  to  impede  the  successful
federal and citizen litigation against Perma-Fix and the relief it provides.

Thus,  it  is  not  surprising  that  residents  of  Drexel  have  grown  frustrated  and
angry  and  have  lost  the  trust  they  had  in  ATSDR.  There  are  many  similar  stories
and  word  gets  around.  For  example,  the  Center  for  Health,  Environment  and  Jus-
tice,  an  organization  founded  by  activist  Lois  Gibbs,  has  warned  in  its  publications
that  communities  may  opt  to  boycott  ATSDR  (and  cooperating  State  health  depart-
ments)  unless  the  Agency  negotiates  with  the  community  in  good  faith  regarding
study protocols and related issues of public concern.9

4.0 Recommendations:

What  is  needed  to  create  the  needed  change  at  ATSDR?  First,  I  would  propose
that  this  subcommittee  continue  its  valuable  oversight  of  ATSDR.  Secondly,  the
Subcommittee should press ATSDR to adopt the following policies submit legislation
that would mandate the changes if needed.

1. ATSDR  should  provide  draft  protocols  for  all  exposure  investigations  and
health studies for public review and comment. Upon the request of members

of  the  public  the  Agency  should  be  required  to  subject  protocols  to  inde-
pendent review.

2. ATSDR should undertake the following measures with regard to all commu-
nity-related  documents,  including  health  assessments,  health  studies,  health
consultations and exposure investigations:
• Provide  drafts  of  the  documents  for  public  review  with  a  minimum  40-

day comment period.

• Upon request, subject the draft to peer review by a group of experts free
of ties with ATSDR or facilities which are the subject of the investigation
of concern.

• Upon  request,  the  Agency  should  hold  a  public  meeting  with  regard  to

• The  final  document  should  respond  to  all  community  and  peer  review

comments.

3. In  formulating  its  findings  and  recommendations,  ATSDR  should  utilize  all
pertinent  information  including  federal,  State  and  local  agency  enforcement
actions and evidence contained therein.

4. In  any  case  where  the  Agency  finds  that  it  has  insufficient  evidence  to  sup-
port a finding (e.g., health effects), it should include clear language warning
the  public  or  business  leaders  not  to  equate  the  absence  of  evidence  signifies
an  absence  of  effect  or  concern.  ATSDR  should  monitor  press  coverage  of  all
of  its  community-based  documents;  where  there  are  indications  of  confusing
statements  or  misinterpretations,  ATSDR  should  take  immediate  and  public
measures to correct such statements.

5.0 An integrated approach to community restoration and health.

Environmentally  stressed  communities  approach  ATSDR  and  other  health  agen-
cies because they have serious concerns and badly need help. Low-income, minority
and  tribal  communities  often  are  impacted  by  a  multitude  of  environmental
stresses:  e.g.,  a  waste  management  facility,  factory  pollution,  highly  toxic  diesel
emissions,  and  unhealthful  levels  of  inhalable  particulates  and/or  ground  level
ozone.  Perhaps  there  are  sewerage  related  problems.  There  are  other  stresses  as
well—such  as  unemployment,  no  access  to  health  care,  aging  populations,  lack  of
adequate  housing,  etc.  Health  agency  actions  which  focus  on  a  single  source  are
poorly equipped to deal with this these situations.

Needs  vary  from  one  community  to  another;  i.e.,  the  local  health  clinic  may  need
expertise to deal with environmental exposures, perhaps a local credit union or pen-
sion  fund  could  invest  in  restoring  homes  to  livability,  or  perhaps  the  need  is  set
up  volunteers  to  visit  the  homes  of  elderly  neighbors  on  a  continuing  basis.  Such
efforts  will  require  a  different  vision  and  much  greater  coordination  between  pro-
grams  and  agencies.  However,  there  are  examples  of  community-based  approaches
which  attempt  to  solve  problems  holistically.  For  example,  in  Trenton,  a  non-profit
organization,  Isles,  Inc.  has  set  up  programs  to  remove  lead  from  home  environ-
ments  and  has  trained  residents  to  address  these  problems  and  to  restore  dilapi-
dated  buildings.  These  programs  have  led  to  employment  and  entrepreneurial  op-
portunities. Trenton has the potential to bring in up to $2.4 million for green collar
jobs  and  career  development  activities,  many  of  them  connected  to  restoration  and
improved environmental health. See http://www.isles.org/

This  program  is  by  no  means  unique.  In  fact,  President  Obama’s  economic  stim-
ulus  package  contains  funding  for  community-based  training  and  employment  in
areas  such  as  weatherization  and  renewable  energy.  (See  also,  The  Green  Collar
Economy by Van Jones and Ariane Conrad, 2008 for many examples of community-
based  initiatives  aimed  to  bring  environmental  health  and  economic  progress  to
communities.)

I  believe  that  public  health  agencies  including  ATSDR  could  play  an  important
role  in  fostering  the  kind  of  interagency  and  inter-departmental  coordination  that
is  needed  to  bring  a  more  holistic  and  cost-effective  approach  to  community  health.

BIOGRAPHY FOR HENRY S. COLE

Henry S. Cole, Ph.D., the President of Henry S. Cole & Associates, is an environ-
mental  and  atmospheric  scientist  with  broad  and  in-depth  experience  on  issues  in-
volving  air  pollution,  involving  facility  emissions,  air  pollution  meteorology  and
source receptor relationships. His experience includes a wide range of pollutants and
sources  including  landfills,  incinerators,  power  plants,  cement  kilns,  and  industrial
plants.  Dr.  Cole  has  a  broad  and  interdisciplinary  background  in  environmental
Earth  sciences  as  well  as  atmospheric  sciences  which  enables  him  to  provide  sci-
entific support and expert opinion on the transport and fate of contaminants in the
environment. Dr. Cole is a professional member of the American Meteorological As-
sociation and the American Chemical Society and has won awards from the U.S. En-
vironmental Protection Agency, Sierra Club, and Clean Water Action.

Education

Cole earned his BS with high honors at Rutgers University College of Agriculture
(1965) with majors in soil science and meteorology. He obtained his Ph.D. in meteor-
ology  at  the  University  of  Wisconsin  in  1969  and  received  broad  training  in  atmos-
pheric sciences including dynamics, thermodynamics, climatology, micrometeorology,
and physical meteorology.

Faculty Research and Teaching

As  a  faculty  member  of  the  University  of  Wisconsin–Parkside  (1969–1977)  Cole
conducted  EPA-sponsored  research  on  the  air  pollution  problems  affecting  the  Chi-
cago-Milwaukee L, Michigan shoreline corridor. He co-authored some of the earliest
and  most  referenced  journal  articles  on  the  impact  and  modeling  of  shoreline
sources  (e.g.,  power  plants,  urban  emissions).  (See  Publications  List).  Cole  taught  a
variety of courses including meteorology, environmental Earth sciences, and air pol-
lution  meteorology.  He  received  tenure  and  promotion  to  Associate  Professor  in
1976. During this period, Cole served as a member of the Wisconsin State Air Pollu-
tion Control Council.

U.S. EPA Senior Scientist

During  the  period  1977–1983,  Dr.  Cole  served  as  a  senior  scientist  in  U.S.  EPA’s
Office  of  Air  Quality  Planning  and  Standards  (Monitoring,  Data  and  Analysis  Divi-
sion). In this capacity, Cole directed the Modeling Application Section of the Source
Receptor Analysis Branch. This Section used point/stationary source, urban, and re-

gional modeling to develop emission limits and ambient air strategies as part of the
regulatory  process.  In  position  as  Section  Chief,  Dr.  Cole  supervised  staff  in  their
application of numerous point source, urban source, and regional air quality models.

Clean Water Action

From  1983–1993,  Cole  served  as  Science  Director  of  Clean  Water  Fund  Action,  a
national  environmental  public  interest  organization  headquartered  in  Washington,
DC.  Cole  authored  a  number  of  studies  on  EPA’s  Superfund  program,  the  impacts
of  municipal  waste  incinerators  and  on  the  Nation’s  mercury  problem.  During  this
period  Cole  frequently  provided  testimony  to  Congressional  committees  on  issues
pertaining to Superfund cleanups, mercury emissions, solid waste management poli-
cies, and pollution prevention (e.g., alternatives to PCE-based dry cleaning).

DISCUSSION

Chair  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Cole.  Mr.  Mier  testified—you  all
were all here for the earlier panel. Mr. Mier testified, showed pho-
tographs  of  animals  in  his  community  in  Midlothian,  Texas,  and
said  ATSDR  was  not  interested  in  seeing  his  animals  or  the  pic-
tures  of  his  animals.  Dr.  Hoffman  said  that  obvious  apparent  ef-
fects  on  animals  would  get  his  attention,  and  I  think  if  I  had  no-
ticed  that  every  tadpole  near  my  house  had  two  heads,  I  would
worry a little bit.

MORE ANIMALS AS SENTINELS OF HUMAN HEALTH

Dr. Ozonoff, what is the value or the reliability of effects on ani-
mals  in  predicting  as  a  sentinel  or  an  indicator  of  what  effects
there may be on human health?

Dr. OZONOFF. Well, there is a long tradition, actually, in epidemi-
ology  of  doing  epidemiology  on  animals  as  well  as  doing  it  on  peo-
ple.  There  are  numerous  studies  in  the  literature,  for  example,  of
trapping small rodents called voles and other small animals around
hazardous  waste  sites,  net  cropping  them  to  see  what  the  health
effects  are.  In  Vietnam,  Agent  Orange  was  looked  at  because—one
reason  it  was  looked  at  was  because  of  epidemiology  on  dogs,  the
canine  dogs  that  were  in  Vietnam.  The  canary  in  the  coal  mine  is
another  classic  example.  These  are  all  warning  flags.  They  don’t
give you the answer, but they are like a big sign in the ground that
says dig here.

PEER REVIEW

Chair  MILLER.  Dr.  Ozonoff,  you  have  said  you  were  a  part  of  a
panel some time ago that recommended that ATSDR health assess-
ments  be  subject  to  independent  peer  review.  What  has  ATSDR’s
response to that recommendation been?

Dr.  OZONOFF.  I  can’t  give  you  a  tally  on  how  many  of  their  as-
sessments  are  peer  reviewed.  My  impression  is  very  few,  but  that
some of them are often on the basis of controversy or pressure. One
of  the  things  that  we  saw  in  the  original  GAO  panel  was  that  the
squeaky  wheel  got  the  grease  and  that  health  assessments  around
very active community sites that made a lot of noise were more de-
tailed  and  got  more  attention  than  those  that  didn’t.  In  fact,  some
of  them  in  the  original  batch  of  800-some  or  700-some  under  the
initial mandate were just cut-and-paste jobs of EPA memos, where-
as if there was a community, an active community group very con-
cerned about what was going on, they would get more attention.

Chair MILLER. Dr. Wilson, you were nodding vigorously.
Dr. WILSON. I think that we have enough fingers and toes to cal-
culate  the  number  of  health  assessments  and  consultations  that
routinely  are  peer  reviewed.  I  recommended  in  my  Stauffer  report
that a new health assessment be conducted and that it be peer re-
viewed,  and  that  was  looked  at  as  way  out  of  proportion  for  what
could  and  should  be  done.  I  recommend  that  all  of  them  have  the
peer-review  process.  We  are  already  spending  well  over  400  days.
If we just speed up a little bit, we will have time to do peer review
within that 400 days and still get a better quality product.

INFORMATION ACCESS

Chair  MILLER.  Dr.  Wilson  testified  to  the  unwillingness  of
ATSDR  to  push  to  get  information,  to  get  documents.  What  would
be  the  effect  of  the  lack  of  those  documents  or  what  might  be  the
effect?  Dr.  Ozonoff,  how  important  is  it  that  they  get  the  informa-
tion that might be available to other agencies or in the private sec-
tor?

Dr.  OZONOFF.  Well,  I  think  there  is  an  interesting  pattern  that
emerges  when  you  look  at  the  health  assessments.  There  is  a  lot
of  emphasis  on  exposure  pathways,  analyzing  exposure,  and  to
some  extent  toxicology,  and  a  lot  of  that  is  a  function  of  the  fact
that those documents are easy to get. The EPA has got a lot of ex-
posure  information,  so  that  is  available  to  them.  And  a  lot  of
ATSDR health assessors sit actually in EPA regional offices so that
there is not so much independence between those two, and it is one
reason  that  I  think  EPA  doesn’t  find  the  health  assessments  very
useful  because  they  are  redundant  of  documents  that  are  with
EPA.

When  it  comes  to  documents  that  are  health  related,  I  think
there  is  just  not  enough  effort  expended  to  get  the  documentation
both about community concerns—EPA often will be very frank with
both  State  agencies  and  communities  in  saying  that  they  don’t
want  to  have  public  meetings  with  communities  because  of  the
abuse  that  they  suffer  when  they  are  at  public  meetings,  so  they
meet on them one on one. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is
the  Agency  withdrawing  from  the  community  because  of  the  com-
munity’s  response,  the  community  then  seeing  that  the  Agency  is
withdrawing, and it becomes a self-reinforcing cycle. This is no way
to get the kind of information that we are talking about.

DIFFICULTY WITH EPIDEMIOLOGY

Chair  MILLER.  One  more  question,  although  the  red  light  is  on.
Dr.  Ozonoff,  your  testimony  was  probably  more  critical  than  my
opening  statement,  although  perhaps  more  elegantly  put  than
jackleg  science.  What  is  the  effect  on  the  health  of  human  beings
from a pattern of inconclusive studies?

Dr.  OZONOFF.  You  are  asking  me  a  question  that  I  am  very  con-
flicted about because I understand from my own work how difficult
it  is  to  do  these  studies.  One  of  the  things  that  I  have  said  during
my  career  that  gets  quoted  most  often  essentially  started  out  as  a
joke,  and  like  a  lot  of  jokes  there  is  a  grain  of  truth  to  it,  which
is that a definition of a public health catastrophe is a health effect

so powerful that even an epidemiological study can detect it. Epide-
miology,  you  know,  is  not  a  very  sensitive  tool.  It  is  a  very  blunt
instrument to try and figure out what is going on.

But I think that what Dr. Cole said is exactly right. The conten-
tion  that  this  is  inconclusive  or  that  we  don’t  see  anything  or  that
there doesn’t appear to be something going on is really interpreted
as  a  statement  that  nothing  is  going  on,  but  the  absence  of  evi-
dence  is  evidence  of  absence.  And  that  is  particularly  harmful  to
these communities who then get no follow-up.

So  I  don’t  know  what  we  would  find  if  we  followed  up  on  these
communities.  That  is  part  of  the  problem  which  is  that  it  remains
invisible.

Chair  MILLER.  Dr.  Cole,  you  were  raising  your  hand  that  you

wanted to chime in despite the fact——

Dr. COLE. Yeah, I do want to——
Chair MILLER.—that the red light is on.
Dr.  COLE.—chime  in  because  there  is  a  question  of  what  you  do
when  there  is  scientific  uncertainty,  when  there  are  a  lot  of  symp-
toms,  when  the  data  is  sparse,  when  the  resources  don’t  produce
the  evidence  that  you  are  really  looking  for,  yet  there  is  a  sense
that there really is a problem. In those instances, I believe that the
public  health  model,  and  this  is  a  public  health  agency,  is  to  err
on  the  side  of  caution  and  to  act  preventively.  We  don’t  have  to
wait, do we, until there are corpses, until there are people and fam-
ilies that are suffering?

Let  me  give  you  one  very  specific  thing  that  could  have  been
done at Perma-Fix had there been a different mindset and perhaps
a slightly different mission at ATSDR. Had they looked at all of the
data,  they  would  have  found  that  there  were  a  lot  of  hazardous
wastes  coming  into  that  facility,  Perma-Fix,  that  contained  form-
aldehyde,  a  probable  carcinogen,  a  very  toxic,  hazardous  air  pollu-
tion. It is volatile. It escapes. Had they done what I consider to be
their job, they would have found out, where are the sources? Where
is  that  waste  coming  from  that  contains  all  that  formaldehyde?
And then go to those sources and find out what substitutions might
be made or what processes could be added to the facilities that gen-
erate  that  waste  that  would  reduce  the  amount  of  formaldehyde.
That is what prevention is, to take a look at the problem, not wait
until  there  is  exact  scientific  evidence  which,  as  Dr.  Ozonoff  and
others have said, is often difficult.

Also,  we  know  that  prevention  oftentimes  saves  all  kinds  of
money.  It  is  cost  effective  because  there  are  many  health  effects,
both in the workplace and in the environment that could be avoid-
ed, and that is a very good way to reduce health care costs, to im-
prove the health of communities, the environmental health of com-
munities, around this country.

Chair  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Cole.  There  is  a  college  faculty
joke  that  administrators  don’t  like  to  have  scientists  on  their  uni-
versity panels because they know where they stand. When the data
changes, their opinions change. Dr. Broun.
POTENTIAL FIXES

Mr.  BROUN.  Thank  you,  Chair.  I’ll  also  start  off  to  ask  you  all
a  question  that  I  asked  the  first  panel,  and  obviously  you  all  have

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00312 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

pretty much answered that. If you were a dictator, what would you
do  differently  to  fix  the  problem,  but  let  me  ask  Dr.  Ozonoff,  Doc-
tor, if we could make a change to accomplish the purposes of which
ATSDR is supposed to be doing, with what you are doing and other
entities  around  the  country  are  doing  and  even  State  agencies  as
I  think  you  mentioned  in  your  testimony  are  doing,  if  we  enabled
you  or  other  entities,  governmental  or  private,  to  be  able  to  do
these  studies,  wouldn’t  we  be  better  off?  Why?  Why  not?  Just  de-
pending on how you answer the question.

Dr.  OZONOFF.  I  am  a  scientist,  so  I  am  always  going  to  say  that
research  pays  off  and  it  is  good  to  do  research,  and  in  fact,  that
is  exactly  what  I  am  going  to  say.  It  is  very  difficult  to  know  in
advance what the benefit of any particular area of basic science re-
search is going to be, except that we know that on average it pays
off. At the risk of special pleading, let me just make an observation
that  lots  of  money  was  injected  into  the  NIH  and  the  recent  stim-
ulus package, but not all of NIH got money. The research program
that  provides  the  basic  science  for  the  Superfund  program,  under-
lying  the  basic  science  that  we  are  talking  about,  got  zero.  CDC,
except  for  bricks  and  mortar,  got  zero.  NIOSH,  which  does  the
equivalent thing in the workplace, got zero. And part of the reason
is is what Dr. Cole said. There is a vision here that is missing, and
it  is  just  not  missing  at  ATSDR.  You  know,  there  is  a  wry  adage
among scientists, or at least cancer scientists, which is that no Sen-
ator  championed  an  agency  because  his  wife  didn’t  get  breast  can-
cer  or  no  Congresswoman  championed  an  agency  because  her  chil-
dren  were  born  healthy.  When  public  health  works,  nothing  hap-
pens, right? So therefore we don’t have champions.

I  think  we  are  seeing  some  of  the  results  of  that.  Public  health
agencies  are  not  receiving  the  kind  of  moral  support  and  vision,
and  they  are  not  being  invested  from  the  top  down  with  the  kind
of  passion  for  public  health  that  is  required.  That  would  make  a
huge  difference,  and  of  course,  I  am  a  scientist.  I  believe  that  re-
search is important.

Mr. BROUN. Well, could we do that in the private sector if we just
enable  the  private  sector  to  do  these  things?  Obviously  there  are
strong  pressures  as  Dr.  Cole,  in  his  testimony,  talked  about  just
from  a  liability  perspective.  Couldn’t  we  do  this  better  in  the  pri-
vate sector instead of having one central governmental agency that
is  not  undergoing  peer  review  and  not  undergoing  the  types  of  in-
vestigative  work  and  really  is  not  charged  or  given  the  ability  to
do so, it seems to me?

Dr. OZONOFF. Well, I am in the private sector, and of course our
research is conducted in the private sector with public monies, but
I  am  very,  as  I  said  in  my  testimony,  very  strongly  of  the  opinion
that public health has the word public in it, that it is a public func-
tion,  that  it  is  a—it  carries  out  a  common  purpose,  all  right,  and
that  common  purpose  is  very  important.  It  needs  to  be  supported.
And  ATSDR  I  think  fulfills  a  role  that  just  has  to  be  fulfilled.
Somebody  has  to  be  looking  at  these  communities  from  the  public
health point of view, and that is what ATSDR was tasked with.

Mr. BROUN. Well, Dr. Cole, my time is about out so——
Dr. COLE. I think——
Mr. BROUN.—but you will have to answer quickly, please.

Dr.  COLE.—you  touch  on  something  important  which  you  said,
can  one  agency  carry  out  the  mission?  And  remember,  the  mission
not only talks about science and determinations of cause and effect,
it  also  talks  about  prevention  of  harm.  And  I  don’t  think  we  can
forget that, and if you look at these communities, you will find that
there  are  typically  many,  many  health  hazards  in  those  commu-
nities.  Diesel  trucks,  other  plants  besides  the  one  that  ATSDR  or
the landfill that they are investigating. There are multiple environ-
mental  stresses,  particularly  in  so-called  environmental  justice
communities,  low-income  communities.  And  these  communities  not
only  have  many  environmental  stresses  but  economic  stresses,  nu-
tritional  stresses,  and  many  other  stresses  which  complicate  the
health effects. So the question is, what is the role of an agency like
ATSDR  in  those  kinds  of  situations?  And  this  gets  to  your  point
that no one agency can do all of that. You know, there are economic
concerns, there are energy concerns such as the need to weatherize
homes  and  whatnot,  there  is  lead  in  homes.  Why  not  train  local
people to be a part of the solution to many of those problems? And
there  are  examples  of  that.  For  example,  in  Trenton,  New  Jersey,
community members have been trained to clean up the lead in peo-
ple’s  homes.  They  get  a  job  out  of  it.  That  has  led  to  broader  res-
toration  efforts.  So  what  can  an  agency  like  ATSDR  do?  Perhaps
it  can  coordinate—go  into  a  community,  work  with  a  community,
find  out  what  the  needs  are  from  the  community,  and  then  go  to
other  agencies  and  the  private  sector.  Maybe  there  is  a  plant  that
would  contribute  to  taking  care  of  something.  Maybe  they  would
clear a lot for a public park. Everyone can be part of that solution,
but you can’t slice and dice health. Health is a holistic concept. You
have to look at the community and all of the things that are going
on.

And  I  think  the  most  unfortunate  thing  is  the  stove-piping  of
government. You have EPA over here, you have the Commerce De-
partment  here,  you  have  ATSDR  over  here,  CDC  here,  and  really
it  takes,  to  deal  with  a  community,  it  takes  a  village  as  someone
said. Thanks for your forbearance there.

Mr. BROUN. Thank you, Chair.
Chair  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Broun.  Dr.  Ozonoff,  do  you  have

an opinion on whether Dr. Broun is a real scientist?

Dr. OZONOFF. As a physician, yes, I do. Yes, he is a real scientist.
Chair  MILLER.  I  want  to  thank  this  panel  as  well,  and  we  will

take another quick break before our last panel. Thank you.

Panel III:

Chair MILLER. Our final witness is Dr. Howard Frumkin, the Di-
rector  of  ATSDR  and  the  National  Center  for  Environmental
Health.  Dr.  Frumkin,  you  will  have  five  minutes  to  provide  a  spo-
ken  testimony,  an  oral  testimony.  Your  full  written  testimony  will
be included in the record.

Again,  it  is  the  practice  of  this  committee  to  take  testimony

under oath. Do you have any objection to taking an oath?

Dr. FRUMKIN. No, sir.

Chair  MILLER.  And  you  have  a  right  to  be  represented  by  coun-

sel. Do you have counsel here today?

Dr. FRUMKIN. No.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  HOWARD  FRUMKIN,  DIRECTOR,  NA-
TIONAL CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND AGEN-
CY FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND DISEASE REGISTRY (NCEH/
ATSDR)
Dr.  FRUMKIN.  Chair  Miller,  Dr.  Broun,  Representative  Broun,
good  morning.  I  am  a  physician  and  epidemiologist  with  27  years
of experience ranging from primary health care to research to envi-
ronmental  health  practice.  I  have  a  long  and  public  record  to  com-
mitment to science, public health advocacy, and community service.
As  a  scientist,  I  am  deeply  committed  to  using  the  best  science.
As  a  public  health  advocate,  I  am  passionate  about  promoting
health  and  protecting  the  public  from  hazards.  As  a  caregiver,  I
know that statistics are only proxies for real people and that when
I serve those people, they deserve all of my skill, compassion, integ-
rity,  and  courage,  and  as  a  public  servant,  I  am  accountable  for
achieving these results.

I  am  proud  of  my  agency,  of  our  excellent  staff,  and  of  the  work
we  do  in  protecting  public  health.  I  testified  before  this  sub-
committee  almost  a  year  ago  at  a  hearing  that  focused  on  our  re-
sponse  to  Hurricane  Katrina,  including  our  work  specific  to  form-
aldehyde  in  temporary  housing  units.  I  testified  at  that  time  that
in  some  respects  we  could  and  should  have  done  better.  I  also
noted  that  there  were  key  lessons  to  be  learned.  During  the  past
year,  we  have  taken  important  steps  to  ensure  that  our  current
and  future  work  builds  on  those  lessons,  the  point  to  which  I  will
return.

Committee  staff  prepared  a  lengthy  report  in  advance  of  today’s
hearing.  I  respectfully  disagree  with  many  of  the  statements  and
conclusions in that report. I would welcome the opportunity to pro-
vide  a  different  perspective  at  an  appropriate  time.  In  the  mean-
time, in this brief oral statement, I want to make just three points.
First,  protecting  the  public  from  toxic  exposures  is  ATSDR’s  top
priority,  and  we  adhere  scrupulously  to  good  science  in  doing  so.
We  work  at  several  hundred  sites  each  year.  We  identify  public
health  hazards  at  a  substantial  proportion  of  sites.  We  offer  rec-
ommendations  to  protect  the  public,  and  these  recommendations
have  a  strong  track  record  of  implementation  by  appropriate  au-
thorities. In some cases, even when exposures appear to be low, we
recommend  clean-up  activities,  adopting  the  preventive  approach
that Dr. Cole just described.

My  written  testimony  includes  examples  of  our  successful  work
including instances in which we exercised independence and upheld
scientific  integrity  despite  considerable  external  pressure.  Pro-
tecting  the  public  on  the  basis  of  good  science  is  ATSDR’s  top  pri-
ority.

308

Second,  we  recognize  challenges  we  face  and  limitations  to  some
of our work. Some of this is intrinsic to our mission. While commu-
nities  expect  us  to  provide  definitive  answers  about  the  links  be-
tween exposure and illnesses, even the best science sometimes does
not  permit  firm  conclusions.  An  ailing  patient  visiting  a  doctor  ex-
pects  a  definite  diagnosis,  but  even  the  most  thorough  diagnostic
workup  cannot  always  yield  an  answer.  At  other  times,  the  data
needed to assess the health effects of an exposure simply have not
been collected, as if a physician had to attempt a diagnosis without
blood  test  results.  In  still  other  cases,  we  reach  conclusions  based
on  very  sound  science,  but  members  of  the  public  differ  with  our
conclusions.  These  are  all  situations  in  which  the  communities  we
serve feel distressed and disappointed, and so do we.

Another challenge is this. Our staff has declined from about 500
in the early years of this decade to about 300 now. The implications
are obvious.

Let  me  acknowledge  that  we  are  not  perfect.  As  strong  and
science-based  as  our  work  is,  there  are  things  we  could  do  better.
In  this  morning’s  testimony,  we  heard  a  number  of  very  sobering
and disturbing perceptions. If we don’t communicate well, if we are
not  accountable  to  communities,  if  we  don’t  use  available  data
fully, if we don’t use the best possible monitoring techniques, if we
don’t  correct  misrepresentations  of  our  work  by  other  agencies  or
individuals,  I  don’t  believe  these  things  happen  regularly  or  often,
but if they do, shame on us and we should do better.

I am firmly committed to representing opportunities for us to do

better and to continuously improving our performance.

This  leads  to  my  third  point.  We  are  working  vigorously  to  im-
prove our work in four categories: overall mission, science adminis-
tration, organizational management, and specific procedures.

With regard to overall mission, we are convening a national con-
versation  to  examine  not  only  ATSDR’s  approaches  to  protecting
public  health,  but  how  our  work  fits  into  the  broader  universe  of
agencies and organizations. We believe that some of our core prac-
tices  now  more  than  two  decades  old  may  be  ready  for  renovation,
a perception that some of this morning’s witnesses echoed.

With  regard  to  science  administration,  the  Board  of  Scientific
Counselors,  an  independent  expert  body,  conducted  a  detailed  re-
view  of  our  clearance  and  peer-review  procedures  at  my  request.
While the Board found our procedure to be generally sound and ef-
fective,  it  identified  several  opportunities  for  improvement  which
we are implementing. For example, we have beefed up the staffing
in  our  Office  of  Science,  clarified  clearance  requirements  to  our
staff,  and  aligned  one  division  which  had  an  independent  peer-re-
view process with the centrist peer-review procedures.

With  regard  to  organizational  management,  CDC  brought  in  an
external  firm,  PriceWaterhouse,  to  review  our  center  and  to  com-
pare  it  to  others  at  CDC.  The  focus  was  on  human  resource  man-
agement. Overall, our center’s management was comparable to that
across  CDC,  a  bit  better  in  some  respects,  a  bit  worse  in  others.
Several  specific  opportunities  to  improve  emerged,  and  we  have
launched  a  detailed  and  aggressive  management  improvement  ini-
tiative to address them. This includes innovative approaches to hir-
ing  new  talent,  management  training,  skill  building  in  our  staff,

309

improved  issues  tracking,  and  improved  use  of  performance  plan-
ning.

With regard to specific procedures, we continue to make improve-
ments,  refining  the  language  we  use  to  communicate  our  findings
to  the  public,  streamlining  the  updating  of  our  toxicologic  profiles,
replacing the software that tracks our work at sites and more.

Mr.  Chair,  Dr.  Broun,  other  Members  of  the  Committee,  on  my
own  behalf  and  on  behalf  of  enormously  dedicated,  hard-working
staff,  I  affirm  my  commitment  to  good  science,  to  good  science  ad-
ministration,  and  to  public  service.  In  this,  I  fully  agree  with  this
committee.  I  am  proud  of  the  excellent  work  we  do  at  hundreds  of
sites  nationally.  I  recognize  that  even  excellent  work  has  room  for
improvement,  and  I  pledge  diligence  in  identifying  and  acting  on
opportunities  to  improve.  I  appreciate  the  constructive  suggestions
this Committee has provided to date, and I look forward to collabo-
rating with this Committee as we move forward. Thank you.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Frumkin follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF HOWARD FRUMKIN

Good  morning  Chairman  Miller  and  other  distinguished  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  be  here  today.  I  am  Dr.  Howard
Frumkin,  Director  of  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Disease  Registry
(ATSDR)  and  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention’s  (CDC’s)  National
Center for Environmental Health (NCEH).

I  am  a  physician  with  27  years  of  experience  in  environmental  and  occupational
medicine and epidemiology. I have been Director of NCEH/ATSDR since September
2005.  Previously,  I  served  as  Chairman  of  the  Department  of  Environmental  and
Occupational Health at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health and Pro-
fessor of Medicine at Emory Medical School.

I am committed to the goal of serving the public by protecting the public’s health,
and bringing to bear the best science in doing so. As a public servant, I am account-
able  for  achieving  this  goal.  I  am  very  proud  of  ATSDR’s  overall  efforts  to  protect
the public’s health from chemical exposures.

I  testified  before  this  committee  on  April  1,  2008,  at  a  hearing  that  focused  on
the  work  of  ATSDR  and  NCEH  in  responding  to  Hurricane  Katrina,  including  our
work specific to formaldehyde in temporary housing trailers. I testified at that time
that in some respects we could and should have done better. I also noted that there
were key lessons to be learned. During the past year we have taken important steps
to ensure that our current and future work builds on those lessons, which I will ad-
dress later in this testimony.

Today’s testimony will discuss more broadly ATSDR’s scientific and programmatic

activities, and will focus on three areas.

• First,  I  will  provide  background  on  ATSDR,  including  examples  of  work  the
Agency  has  conducted  at  specific  sites  in  communities  across  the  United
States.

• Next, I will discuss some of the challenges faced by ATSDR.
• Finally, I will share a vision for ATSDR as we look toward the future, empha-
sizing  our  commitment  to  continuous  improvement  in  four  categories:  overall
mission, science administration, organizational management, and specific pro-
cedures.

The ATSDR Story

ATSDR  is  the  principal  non-regulatory  federal  public  health  agency  responsible
for  addressing  health  effects  associated  with  toxic  exposures.  The  Agency’s  mission
is  to  serve  the  public  by  using  the  best  science,  taking  responsive  public  health  ac-
tions,  and  providing  trustworthy  health  information  to  prevent  harmful  exposures
and disease related to exposures to toxic substances.

ATSDR  was  created  by  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,  Compensa-
tion, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, more commonly known as the Superfund
law,  and  came  into  existence  several  years  later.  CERCLA  reflected  Congressional
and public concern with toxic chemicals, particularly hazardous waste, in the after-
math  of  such  environmental  disasters  as  Love  Canal  (New  York)  in  the  late  1970s.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00317 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

310

ATSDR was charged with implementing the health-related provisions of CERCLA.
The  language  in  CERCLA,  and  in  the  subsequent  Superfund  Amendments  and  Re-
authorization Act of 1986—or SARA—leaves room for interpretation, but in general
terms,  it  assigns  ATSDR  four  responsibilities,  each  of  which  is  described  in  more
detail below:

• Protecting the public’s health
• Building the science base on toxic chemicals
• Providing information on toxic chemicals to health professionals and the pub-
• Establishing and maintaining registries.

lic

ATSDR  has  pursued  each  of  these  responsibilities  during  the  nearly  quarter  cen-
tury since it came into being. Our work is very complex and it has not always been
perfect,  as  I  acknowledged  to  this  committee  last  year,  but  overall  I  am  proud  of
the  wide  range  of  achievements,  and  proud  that  we  have  constantly  sought  to  im-
prove our performance.

Protecting the Public’s Health

A  core  function  of  ATSDR  is  assessing  potential  health  hazards  posed  by  haz-
ardous  waste  sites  and  making  recommendations  for  protecting  public  health.  This
is a mandated function in the case of Superfund sites, and discretionary in the case
of other hazardous waste sites. Our site-specific work is presented in one of several
forms: Public Health Assessments, Public Health Consultations, Exposure Investiga-
tions, and Technical Assists.

A Public Health Assessment, or PHA, is generally conducted when there are mul-
tiple contaminants and potential pathways of exposure. In a PHA, ATSDR examines
past,  present,  and  future  exposure  scenarios  to  evaluate  whether  people  were,  are,
or  may  in  the  future  be  exposed  to  hazardous  substances  and,  if  so,  whether  that
exposure  is  harmful,  or  potentially  harmful,  and  in  what  ways.  ATSDR  scientists
generally  analyze  existing  environmental  and  health  data—provided  by  EPA,  other
government  agencies,  businesses,  and  the  public—and  make  recommendations.  In
some  instances  ATSDR  scientists  conduct  their  own  health  or  exposure  investiga-
tions.  A  Health  Consultation  is  similar  to  a  Public  Health  Assessment  in  that  it
evaluates  environmental  data  and  how  people  might  be  exposed,  but  focuses  on  a
more  specific  health  question  and  uses  a  more  limited  data  set.  The  purpose  of  an
Exposure  Investigation  is  to  fill  environmental  or  biologic  knowledge  gaps  with  in-
formation needed for our public health work. A Technical Assist is a brief document
that answers a specific, narrow question; because it does not require extensive back-
ground  research  and  data  analysis,  it  is  generally  completed  more  rapidly  than  the
more detailed reports.

Recommendations  for  protecting  health  and  preventing  exposures  are  regular
components  of  these  documents.  ATSDR  is  not  a  regulatory  agency;  our  reports
identify  recommended  actions  that  would  be  appropriate  for  EPA  or  other  authori-
ties  to  undertake,  but  do  not  compel  these  actions.  Recommendations  are  directed
to  entities  responsible  for  characterizing  or  mitigating  exposures,  including  State
and  local  government  agencies.  Our  reports  may  also  recommend  that  our  agency
conduct further work such as health studies, or health professional and community
education. If there is an urgent health threat, ATSDR can issue a public health ad-
visory warning people of the danger. ATSDR can also carry out health education or
pilot studies of health effects, full-scale epidemiological studies, exposure or disease
registries,  disease  and  exposure  surveillance  activities,  or  research  on  specific  haz-
ardous substances.

In  addition,  ATSDR  can  help  protect  the  public  from  chemical  exposures  in  set-
tings  other  than  hazardous  waste  sites,  circumstances  that  are  collectively  referred
to as ‘‘releases.’’ These releases may range from chemical plant explosions to a spill
of  coal  combustion  products.  They  can  be  those  identified  by  government  agencies
or by individuals within the community through the petition process.

ATSDR responds to emergencies involving the release of chemicals, most often in
collaboration  with  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency.  ATSDR  personnel  provide
real-time  public  health  guidance  following  acute  releases  of  hazardous  substances
and  health  information  to  the  public  (for  example,  helping  determine  when  people
can safely reoccupy their homes and businesses after an evacuation).

Much  of  this  public  health  protection  work  is  carried  out  by  State  health  depart-
ments,  with  funding  and  technical  support  from  ATSDR.  Our  State  cooperative
agreement  program  functions  in  29  states  and  one  tribal  government.  In  many
cases,  ATSDR  funding  provides  the  only  support  for  these  activities  at  the  State
level.

ATSDR’s work in protecting public health has been highly productive. The Agency
issues between 300 and 400 Health Assessments and Health Consultations, and pro-
vides  more  than  1,000  Technical  Assists,  each  year.  During  the  period  1995–2006,
73  percent  of  our  recommendations  were  implemented  by  federal,  State  and  local
authorities.

Over  the  nearly  quarter  century  of  our  work,  we  have  made  important  contribu-
tions to the way community-based environmental public health is practiced. The re-
quired  knowledge  and  skill  were  hard-won;  in  the  early  years  growing  pains  were
common,  but  over  time  ATSDR  developed  considerable  expertise  in  community-
based  work.  Our  staff  is  committed  to  working  closely  with  the  communities  we
serve, to listening to and respecting community concerns, and to incorporating com-
munity  input  into  our  work  plans.  ATSDR’s  public  communications  recognize  cul-
tural,  ethnic,  and  linguistic  diversity.  The  Agency  has  helped  advance  the  concept
and practice of Environmental Justice, since many of the communities we serve are
poor and/or members of racial and ethnic minorities.

ATSDR  has  a  strong  track  record  of  sticking  to  the  science  and  advancing  public
health,  even  in  sometimes  controversial,  highly  charged  situations.  Several  exam-
ples are illustrative:
• Montana:  Vermiculite  mined  by  the  W.R.  Grace  Company  in  Libby,  Montana,
was  contaminated  with  tremolite  asbestos.  EPA  and  the  Montana  Congressional
delegation  requested  that  ATSDR  evaluate  human  health  concerns  related  to  as-
bestos exposure in Libby. ATSDR has conducted a number of activities in the com-
munity, including: a screening program to identify people whose health may have
been  impacted  by  exposure  to  asbestos  (revealing  that  18  percent  of  those  tested
had  abnormalities  in  the  linings  of  their  lungs,  as  compared  to  between  0.2  and
2.3  percent  of  people  without  asbestos  exposure);  a  mortality  review  that  com-
pared  asbestos-associated  death  rates  for  residents  of  the  Libby  area  with  those
in Montana and the United States (finding that for the 20-year period examined,
mortality  from  asbestosis  was  approximately  40  times  higher  than  the  rest  of
Montana and 60 times higher than the rest of the United States); and a Tremolite
Asbestos  Registry,  a  listing  of  individuals  with  asbestos-related  disease  or  those
at  high  risk  of  developing  asbestos-related  disease  because  of  exposure  to  asbes-
tos.  ATSDR  continues  to  be  actively  involved  with  the  site  and  the  community,
joining recently with EPA to establish the Libby Health Risk Initiative, a program
to add to the understanding of health effects of exposure to Libby amphibole.

• Ohio:  The  Brush-Wellman  company,  in  Ottawa  County,  Ohio,  is  the  major  proc-
essor of beryllium in the United States. ATSDR completed a Health Consultation
in 2002, and found that emissions at the time did not pose a risk. Past emissions
were  known  to  have  exceeded  applicable  standards,  but  available  data  were  not
sufficient  to  permit  assessment  of  the  past  hazard.  Some  local  officials  and  the
company strongly objected to follow-up activity, but ATSDR offered clinical testing
for  beryllium  sensitization  to  local  residents.  All  concerned  individuals  were  test-
ed; of 18 participants, none tested positive. Based on that finding, ATSDR did not
recommend  further  testing.  We  followed  up  by  educating  local  health  care  pro-
viders to help them identify and test for beryllium exposure and chronic beryllium
disease.

• Minnesota:  Excel  Dairy  is  a  large  dairy  farm  in  Marshall  County,  Minnesota.
After neighbors complained of odors and respiratory and other symptoms, ATSDR
worked with the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to sample for hydrogen
sulfide  (H2S)  at  nearby  homes.  Data  indicated  that  health  based  guidelines  were
frequently exceeded, often for hours at a time. In 2008 ATSDR recommended that
Excel  Dairy  take  immediate  steps  to  protect  health  and  safety,  especially  of  chil-
dren,  such  as  by  applying  permanent  covers  to  the  manure  lagoons.  ATSDR  also
recommended  that  the  Minnesota  Pollution  Control  Agency  continue  to  monitor
air  emissions  of  hydrogen  sulfide,  and  that  MDH  work  with  local  public  health
officials to provide people living at the Dairy with appropriate information to pro-
tect  their  health  and  safety.  ATSDR  also  indicated  that  if  measures  to  eliminate
exceedances of the state’s standards for H2S were not effective, the Agency would
consider further exposure monitoring in coordination with MDH. In 2008 ATSDR
testified before a House Subcommittee on this matter. EPA is collecting hydrogen
sulfide  readings  from  the  facility  and  will  continue  to  conduct  a  follow-up  assess-
ment.

• New  Jersey:  The  Kiddie  Kollege  Day  Care  Center  in  Franklin  Township,  New
Jersey,  was  housed  in  a  former  thermometer  factory,  exposing  children  and  staff
to  mercury.  In  2007,  ATSDR  worked  with  New  Jersey  health  and  environmental
officials  and  staff  at  the  nearby  Pediatric  Environmental  Health  Specialty  Unit,

a university-based effort funded partially by ATSDR, to assess the exposures. Ini-
tial  findings  included  elevated  levels  in  31  percent  of  children  and  33  percent  of
adults tested, with follow-up testing after exposure had stopped showing a reduc-
tion to low levels. New Jersey has since enacted legislation establishing stringent
criteria  before  building  permits  can  be  issued  for  day  care  or  educational  institu-
tions in environmentally high risk sites. ATSDR was directed to prepare a report
on children’s exposure to mercury, which was recently submitted to two Congres-
sional committees.

• North  Carolina:  During  the  1990s,  residents  of  Randolph  County,  North  Caro-
lina, complained of respiratory symptoms that they associated with a nearby poly-
urethane  foam  manufacturing  plant.  ATSDR  worked  with  State  authorities  to
conduct blood testing and air monitoring. The findings prompted ATSDR to issue
a  public  health  advisory  on  October  20,  1997,  advising  local,  State,  and  federal
officials  of  potential  adverse  health  impacts  from  hazardous  air  emissions.  Con-
cern  focused  on  toluene  diisocyanate,  a  known  trigger  of  obstructive  airway  dis-
orders. ATSDR also conducted an asthma investigation of children residing within
a  mile  radius  and  found  an  elevated  prevalence  of  this  disease.  During  the  last
three years, ATSDR and the State health department went on to conduct a more
comprehensive  study  of  exposure  and  health  in  communities  across  North  Caro-
lina, despite strong industry opposition. Current plans include education for local
physicians on the study results.

• Ohio:  City  View  Center,  a  shopping  center  in  Cuyahoga  County,  Ohio,  was  built
on  the  site  of  a  former  landfill.  In  2008,  air  monitors  detected  explosive  levels  of
methane  and  other  combustible  gases.  Based  on  the  available  information,
ATSDR  rapidly  concluded  that  an  urgent  public  health  hazard  was  present,  and
recommended that immediate action be taken. ATSDR’s finding provided the Ohio
EPA, the Ohio Attorney General, and the U.S. EPA with further grounds for com-
pelling  the  property  owner  to  install  an  active  vapor  extraction  system  on  the
landfill to reduce the migration of gases into the shopping center.

Building the Science Base on Toxic Chemicals

In  crafting  CERCLA,  Congress  assigned  an  applied  research  role  to  ATSDR,
which  complements  the  biomedical  research  role  of  the  National  Institute  for  Envi-
ronmental  Health  Sciences  (NIEHS).  The  Agency  has  combined  a  program  of  origi-
nal  research  with  a  longstanding  commitment  to  assembling  and  making  widely
available the results of research across the scientific community.

ATSDR’s  applied  research  includes  toxicologic  research.  In  some  cases  this  re-
search is conducted in-house; for example, ATSDR scientists have developed innova-
tive  techniques  of  computational  toxicology  to  help  rapidly  assess  hazards  of  chem-
ical  releases.  In  other  cases,  ATSDR  identifies  critical  toxicologic  data  needs  and
works with other federal agencies, as well as State agencies, universities, and volun-
teer organizations to fill those needs.

A key feature of ATSDR’s scientific research is that it often grows out of site-spe-
cific  public  health  activities.  For  example,  as  discussed  earlier,  ATSDR  scientists
have conducted a series of epidemiological studies in Libby, Montana, to assess the
health effects of residents’ long-term exposure to asbestos and related minerals.

Still other parts of ATSDR’s research advance the science of exposure assessment.
For  example,  in  evaluating  the  health  effects  of  past  exposures  to  trichloroethylene
in  drinking  water  at  Camp  Lejeune,  North  Carolina,  ATSDR  scientists  confronted
a  challenge:  how  to  quantify  people’s  past  exposure  to  contaminants.  Marines  and
their  families  had  consumed  water  over  a  period  of  years  from  a  variety  of  sources
on the base that had varying levels of contamination. It became necessary to recon-
struct  past  exposures  based  on  available  records—a  complex  process  requiring  his-
torical analysis of contaminated drinking water using innovative ground water mod-
eling  and  statistical  techniques.  ATSDR  scientists  developed  and  refined  the  nec-
essary techniques with input from panels of experts and peer reviewers.

ATSDR  scientists  have  compiled  data  and  called  attention  to  the  problem  of  hy-
drogen  sulfide  exposure  near  construction  and  demolition  landfills,  a  result  of  the
degradation  of  gypsum  wallboard;  and  described  and  quantified  the  problem  of
vapor  intrusion,  when  volatile  chemical  contaminants  in  groundwater  enter  base-
ments.

In  addition  to  original  research,  ATSDR  assembles  existing  data  on  toxic  chemi-
cals.  ATSDR’s  Toxicological  Profiles  are  thorough  reviews  of  available  toxicological
and epidemiologic information on specific chemicals. They provide screening levels—
called  Minimal  Risk  Levels  (MRLs)—that  ATSDR  health  assessors  and  other  re-
sponders  use  to  identify  contaminants  and  potential  health  effects  that  may  be  of

313

concern at hazardous waste sites. They are widely used references by scientists and
members of the public.

Providing Information on Toxic Chemicals to Health Professionals and the Public

A  third  function  of  ATSDR  is  to  provide  health  professional  and  community  edu-
cation through direct service at the community level, and through broader distribu-
tion  of  materials  through  the  Internet  and  other  mechanisms.  For  example,
ATSDR’s  ToxFAQs  is  a  series  of  summaries  of  information  about  hazardous  sub-
stances. These are user-friendly documents excerpted from Toxicological Profiles and
Public  Health  Statements.  Each  ToxFAQ  serves  as  a  quick  and  comprehensible
guide,  with  answers  to  the  most  frequently  asked  questions  about  exposure  to  haz-
ardous  substances  found  around  hazardous  waste  sites  and  the  effects  of  exposure
on human health.

ATSDR  also  develops  and  provides  medical  education  to  assist  health  profes-
sionals in diagnosing and treating conditions related to hazardous exposures. An ex-
ample  of  this  work  is  ATSDR’s  Case  Studies  in  Environmental  Medicine,  a  series
of  self-instructional  modules  that  increase  clinicians’  knowledge  of  hazardous  sub-
stances  in  the  environment  and  aid  in  the  evaluation  of  potentially  exposed  pa-
tients.  ATSDR  has  developed  other  products  for  the  medical  community,  including
Grand Rounds in Environmental Medicine and Patient Education and Care Instruc-
tion Sheets. In addition, ATSDR and EPA established and support university-based
Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units (PEHSUs) to provide education and
consultation  for  health  professionals,  families  and  others  about  children’s  environ-
mental health.

Establishing and Maintaining Registries

The  fourth  function  assigned  to  ATSDR  is  registries—confidential  databases  de-
signed  to  collect,  analyze,  and  track  information  about  groups  of  people  who  share
defined  exposures  or  illnesses.  ATSDR  also  provides  information  to  registrants
about  health  services  and  other  services  available  to  them  through  other  sources.
Below are examples of registries in which ATSDR currently is actively involved:

• Tremolite  Asbestos  Registry  (TAR).  This  is  a  registry  of  people  exposed  to
tremolite  asbestos  originating  in  Libby,  Montana.  The  TAR  includes  contact,
demographic,  exposure,  and  health  outcome  information  for  each  registrant.
• World  Trade  Center  (WTC)  Health  Registry.  ATSDR  has  supported  the  New
York  City  Health  Department  in  developing  the  World  Trade  Center  Health
Registry. The WTC Health Registry is a comprehensive health survey of per-
sons  in  the  lower  Manhattan  area  of  New  York  City  who  were  most  directly
exposed to the environmental effects of the events of 9/11/2001.

ATSDR Faces Challenges

While  ATSDR  has  protected  public  health,  advanced  science,  and  provided
science-based  information  since  its  inception,  the  Agency  faces  ongoing  significant
challenges. These are described below.

Science Cannot Answer All the Questions Posed at Sites

When communities are concerned about hazardous exposures, they want clear, de-
finitive answers, much as an ailing patient wants a clear, definitive diagnosis. Com-
munities often expect that an agency such as ATSDR will arrive on the scene, rap-
idly assess the situation, and reach unequivocal conclusions. Unfortunately, it is not
always possible to reach such conclusions. Among the reasons:

• Accurate  exposure  data  are  often  unavailable,  especially  for  past  exposures.
Without  accurate  exposure  data,  it  is  impossible  to  correlate  exposures  with
health outcomes.
• Accurate  health  data  are  often  unavailable.  While  registries  for  certain  dis-
eases are sometimes available, such as cancer and birth defects, statistical in-
formation  is  not  routinely  collected  for  most  health  conditions.  Without  accu-
rate  health  data,  well  matched  to  exposure  data  by  time  and  place,  it  is  im-
possible to correlate exposures with health outcomes.
• Some  ailments,  such  as  fatigue  and  headache,  are  difficult  to  measure  objec-
• Complete information on the toxic effects of many chemicals is lacking, espe-
cially for such outcomes as neurobehavioral, developmental, and reproductive
function,  and  especially  following  the  types  of  long-term,  low-dose  exposures
which occur in many communities.

tively, and therefore difficult to characterize quantitatively.

314

• Toxicologic data usually refer to one chemical at a time, but in real life, peo-
ple  frequently  are  exposed  to  mixtures  of  chemicals.  Scientific  data  on  such
mixed exposures are scanty.

• Many  communities  have  relatively  small  populations,  which  are  difficult  to
study  for  reasons  of  statistical  power.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  important
health  findings  typically  emerge  from  large  studies.  The  Framingham  Heart
Study  enrolled  nearly  15,000  people  over  more  than  50  years,  and  the  Na-
tional  Children’s  Study  plans  to  follow  100,000  children  from  before  birth  to
age  21.  In  a  community  with  a  few  hundred  people,  the  opportunities  for  ro-
bust research are far more limited.

In  summary,  definitive  answers  sometimes  do  not  exist,  due  to  the  inherent  un-
certainties  of  science,  the  limits  of  available  data,  the  limits  of  small-area  epidemi-
ology, and the lack of appropriate public health tools.

Moreover,  concerned  citizens  sometimes  have  honest  disagreements  with  the  re-
sults  of  ATSDR  assessments.  While  ATSDR  scientists  use  standardized  methods  to
assure objective results, these sometimes yield conclusions that are not expected by
or acceptable to community members. This is understandable. Community members,
who are justifiably concerned about unwarranted exposures from hazardous wastes,
may reject the concept of ‘‘levels of risk’’ when what they want is zero exposure. For
example,  in  some  situations,  even  where  a  source  of  toxic  chemicals  is  identified,
careful  measurement  may  indicate  that  people  absorb  little  or  none  of  the  toxic
chemical.  Such  findings  can  be  unwelcome  to  people  who  desire  nothing  less  than
complete  elimination  of  the  contaminant.  In  some  cases,  ATSDR  and  counterpart
State  agencies  have  repeated  investigations  several  times,  when  negative  conclu-
sions  were  challenged,  only  to  replicate  the  original  findings—and  consequently  to
face  accusations  of  indifference  or  worse.  Such  situations  are  difficult  and  frus-
trating, both for dedicated ATSDR staff and for community residents who earnestly
seek solutions to their problems.

Heavy Emphasis on Hazardous Waste Sites Relative to Other Exposure Routes

In  the  early  1980s,  following  the  national  attention  generated  by  Love  Canal,
there was considerable focus on hazardous waste sites. CERCLA (including its pub-
lic  health  component,  ATSDR)  reflected  this  focus.  However,  a  variety  of  other
sources,  such  as  food,  consumer  products,  water,  and  air,  are  well  recognized,  and
for  many  Americans  these,  not  hazardous  waste  sites,  are  the  predominant  path-
ways of exposure to chemicals.

Workload Challenges

With  tens  of  thousands  of  hazardous  waste  sites  around  the  Nation,  and  with
countless  other  sources  of  chemical  exposures,  ATSDR  faces  a  potential  workload
that exceeds its current staffing level. Though ATSDR’s on-board FTE strength has
fallen from 481 in FY 2002 to 306 in FY 2008, without a reduction in workload dur-
ing  that  period,  we  continually  strive  to  meet  our  mission  through  increased  effi-
ciencies and productivity and the efforts of our dedicated staff.

Limited Research Capacity Relative to Extensive Data Needs

ATSDR  has  a  specific  challenge  with  regard  to  its  research  capacity.  ATSDR  has
carried out a limited program of targeted research, and has worked to identify data
gaps  and  compile  research  from  industry,  academia,  and  other  agencies.  However,
with  the  extensive  data  needs  related  to  toxic  exposures,  this  remains  an  ongoing
challenge for the Agency.

Ongoing Efforts to Improve ATSDR

ATSDR  is  undertaking  major  efforts  to  improve  its  performance  and  to  meet  the
challenges outlined above. These efforts range broadly, and can be described in four
categories:  review  of  the  overall  approach  to  carrying  out  our  mission,  review  of
science administration processes, review of management practices, and improvement
of certain other procedures.

Review of the Overall Approach to Carrying Out Our Mission

Careful  consideration  of  ATSDR’s  mission  has  revealed  important  challenges,  as
described  above.  After  almost  25  years  of  operation  with  a  relatively  unchanged
portfolio, these challenges justify re-examination of ATSDR’s approach.

That re-examination is made more compelling by the many changes that have oc-
curred  in  chemical  science  and  technology  during  the  quarter  century  of  ATSDR’s

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00322 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

existence.  Together  these  changes  have  revolutionized  the  context  within  which
ATSDR works to protect the public from chemical hazards.

315

• Analytic chemistry tools now permit measurement of unprecedented low levels

of chemical exposures.

• Biomonitoring,  the  direct  measurement  of  chemicals  in  people’s  body  fluids,
has advanced tremendously, enabling scientists to identify and quantify expo-
sures.

• The  genetic  revolution  and  the  emergence  of  the 

‘‘omics’’  (genomics,
proteomics,  metabolomics)  offer  the  potential  to  study  gene-environment
interactions, and to understand exposures and health effects at an individual
level.

• Toxicologic  advances  such  as  computational  and  in  vitro  methods  offer  enor-
mous  opportunities  for  insight  into  chemical  action,  more  rapidly  and  at  less
expense than ever before.

• Green  chemistry  represents  an  innovative  approach  that  seeks  to  design  and
produce  environmentally  safe  chemicals,  avoiding  the  toxic  effects  on  which
ATSDR’s work has focused.

Together,  these  considerations  make  clear  that  a  re-evaluation  of  ATSDR’s  ap-
proach is timely and appropriate. Moreover, it is clear that ATSDR’s responsibility—
protecting  the  public  from  toxic  chemicals—does  not  rest  with  ATSDR  alone.  Many
other  agencies  share  in  this  responsibility,  and  many  other  stakeholders—industry,
environmental  groups,  community  groups,  professional  associations—play  essential
roles.

In fact, review of the Nation’s efforts to protect the public from chemical hazards
over  the  last  four  decades—an  effort  that  includes  ATSDR  but  extends  well  be-
yond—yields  compelling  conclusions.  As  a  nation  we  have  achieved  some  notable
successes,  but  we  remain  limited  in  our  ability  to  assemble  needed  data,  draw  con-
sistent  conclusions,  launch  protective  actions,  and  inform  stakeholders.  Various
agencies  and  organizations—governmental  and  non-governmental,  regulatory  and
non-regulatory—carry  out  public  health  functions  related  to  chemical  exposures.
These functions include exposure and health surveillance, investigation of incidents
and  releases,  emergency  preparedness  and  response,  regulation,  research,  and  edu-
cation.  But  improvements  can  always  be  made  to  increase  coordination.  Some  key
responsibilities  are  not  carried  out  adequately,  while  others  are  needlessly  redun-
dant.  ATSDR’s  mission  and  functions  must  be  considered  within  this  broader  con-
text.

In  recognition  of  these  realities,  ATSDR  and  its  companion  Center  at  the  CDC,
the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), have initiated the National
Conversation  on  Public  Health  and  Chemical  Exposures.  This  process  will  convene
a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  over  one  to  two  years,  including  community  groups,
industry,  environmental  groups,  public  health  groups,  and  others.  Early  responses
from  various  stakeholder  groups  has  been  highly  supportive.  We  expect  this  effort
to yield an action agenda for revitalizing the public health approach to chemical ex-
posures. Part of this agenda will be direction for ATSDR as it moves into its second
quarter century.

Review of Science Administration Processes

In  2008,  this  committee  raised  questions  about  the  adequacy  of  existing  proce-
dures  for  internal  clearance  and  external  peer  review  of  scientific  documents  at
ATSDR. In response, NCEH/ATSDR asked the Board of Scientific Counselors (BSC),
an  external  expert  group  charged  with  advising  the  Center  on  matters  of  science
and  science  policy,  to  assess  these  procedures  and  to  suggest  any  needed  improve-
ments.  The  BSC’s  overall  conclusion  was  that  the  existing  procedures  generally
function well to achieve quality-assurance goals. The BSC report identified and dis-
cussed  several  concerns  and  recommendations.  A  draft  report  was  presented  at  the
November 2008 meeting of the BSC and the BSC approved the final report in early
March  2009.  In  the  meantime,  ATSDR  has  made  specific  improvements.  For  exam-
ple,  an  independent  peer  review  process  maintained  in  one  Division  now  is  subject
to  additional  oversight  consistent  with  Center-wide  procedures;  the  staff  of  the
NCEH/ATSDR  Office  of  Science  has  been  enhanced  through  additional  hiring,  and
review  procedures  have  been  reiterated  to  supervisors  to  help  assure  that  all  staff
scientists are aware of them.

Review of Management Practices

316

In  2008,  this  committee  also  raised  questions  about  management  practices  at
ATSDR.  In  response,  CDC  commissioned  an  independent  review  of  NCEH/ATSDR
management practices. NCEH/ATSDR was compared to two other CDC Centers and
to  data  from  government-wide  management-practice  surveys,  to  permit  conclusions
about areas of particular need within NCEH/ATSDR.

In general, NCEH/ATSDR management practices were found to be comparable to
those across CDC. Several opportunities for improvement were identified. Examples
include: increasing management awareness of, engagement with, and accountability
to the human capital strategy; improving the use of existing human capital systems
including  human  resource  data  systems  and  processes,  performance  management,
and  recruitment  strategies;  and  improving  the  Agency  capability  to  constructively
manage  conflict  and  enable  better  program  and  scientific  results.  In  addition,
NCEH/ATSDR  leadership,  in  consultation  with  those  in  supervisory  positions  at
CDC’s  Coordinating  Center  for  Environmental  Health  and  Injury  Prevention  (that
NCEH/ATSDR is a part of), identified other opportunities for management improve-
ment. From these, NCEH/ATSDR developed a broad plan for management improve-
ment,  and  began  implementing  that  plan  in  late  2008.  The  plan  has  five  areas  of
focus:  (1)  unifying  and  revitalizing  our  mission;  (2)  human  capital  strategy;  (3)
human  capital  practices;  (4)  employee  relations;  and  (5)  quality  of  work  life.  Below
are some examples of steps being taken to improve management.

in efforts to achieve shared goals;

• Initiated strategic planning in each Division, as a step in engaging employees
• Promote  training  of  managers  in  team-building,  leveraging  diversity,  com-
plaint  and  conflict  management,  alternate  dispute  resolution,  and  conduct
and disciplinary actions;
• Adopted  Issues  Management  Tracking  software  in  the  NCEH/ATSDR  Office
of Policy, Planning, and Evaluation, to track issues and provide a mechanism
for senior management to triage scientific issues to the appropriate office, and
to maintain oversight until project completion;
• Initiated a system of job rotation within NCEH/ATSDR to allow staff to move
to different positions for short periods (one to three months), to enhance staff
skills, facilitate collaboration and innovative partnering within these entities,
and improve morale;
• Initiated  several  activities  to  attract  new  public  health  professionals  into

entry-level positions, to ensure that the needs of the future will be met.

Improvement of Specific Procedures

Finally, NCEH/ATSDR continues to make a wide range of changes in specific pro-
cedures,  in  order  to  improve  performance.  Four  examples,  each  specific  to  ATSDR
and each taken from the last year, are illustrative.

• The  wording  of  Public  Health  Assessment  conclusions:  ATSDR  has  for  many
years used five standard categories of conclusions in its Public Health Assess-
ments:  ‘‘Urgent  Public  Health  Hazard,’’  ‘‘Public  Health  Hazard,’’  ‘‘Indetermi-
nate  Public  Health  Hazard,’’  ‘‘No  Apparent  Public  Health  Hazard,’’  and  ‘‘No
Public  Health  Hazard.’’  Concerns  were  raised  about  this  terminology.  In  par-
ticular, the ‘‘No Apparent Public Health Hazard’’ conclusion was seen by some
communities  as  invalidating  their  concerns—an  understandable  reaction,
since it was used in some cases of low but non-zero exposure, where a finding
of  zero  risk  would  be  hard  to  support  scientifically.  ATSDR  reviewed  these
categories  and  developed  a  revised  classification  that  more  clearly  commu-
nicates  risk.  The  new  conclusions  replace  telegraphic  phrases  with  explana-
tory  language,  featuring  specific  information  relative  to  the  substance,  the
pathway, the time period, and the place. For example:

‘‘ATSDR  concludes  that  touching,  breathing,  or  accidentally  eating  zinc
found  in  soil  and  dust  at  the  XYZ  site  is  not  expected  to  harm  people’s
health because zinc levels in soil are below levels of health concern.’’
replaces
‘‘This site posed no apparent public health concern.’’

• Process  for  updating  Toxicologic  Profiles.  Since  its  inception  ATSDR  has  pro-
duced  Toxicologic  Profiles  by  reviewing  the  accumulated  literature  at  a  par-
ticular point in time, culminating in publication of a monograph that prompt-
ly  commenced  to  go  out  of  date.  The  Profile  would  be  updated  some  years

later  with  a  next  edition,  which  would  rather  soon  become  stale.  ATSDR  is
replacing  this  ‘‘book  publication’’  model  with  a  more  contemporary  model
based on ongoing, web-based updates of relevant sections as new material be-
comes available.
• Improved  data  management:  ATSDR  requires  a  sophisticated  data  manage-
ment  system  to  track  its  large  number  of  sites  and  activities.  A  custom-de-
signed system, HazDat, was used for this purpose for years, but became obso-
lete.  In  response,  ATSDR  created  Sequoia,  a  new  database  system,  and
launched it in February 2008. Sequoia is a scientific and administrative data-
base  developed  to  provide  access  to  information  on  the  release  of  hazardous
substances from Superfund sites or from emergency events and to provide ac-
cess  to  information  on  the  effects  of  hazardous  substances  on  the  health  of
human  populations.  Sequoia  assembles  information  on  site  characteristics;
site  activities;  site  events;  contaminants  found;  contaminant  media;  basis  for
concentration  levels,  such  as  maximum,  mean,  or  other  descriptor;  exposure
pathways; impact on the population; ATSDR public health hazard categoriza-
tion; ATSDR recommendations; interventions to be taken, as described in the
public  health  action  plan;  and  a  record  of  intervention  effectiveness.  Sequoia
should  enable  better  tracking  and  attainment  of  performance  measures,  pro-
vide  data  to  support  Healthy  People  objectives,  and  provide  accurate,  com-
prehensive  data  to  support  the  analysis  and  identification  of  site-related
trends  and  the  identification  of  appropriate  public  health  interventions  and
studies.
• Shift in product lines: The standard ATSDR product over the years has been
the  Public  Heath  Assessment.  These  are  thoroughly  researched  documents,
based  on  extensive  data  reviews,  and  often  require  one  to  two  years  to  com-
plete—a delay that was unacceptable to some communities. However, commu-
nity  health  concerns  are  often  fairly  specific.  By  using  a  more  targeted  ap-
proach  such  as  a  Health  Consultation,  Exposure  Investigation,  or  Technical
Assist  to  address  those  specific  concerns,  we  can  respond  more  rapidly,  ad-
dress  public  concerns  more  directly,  and  conserve  scarce  resources  for  in-
stances  when  a  full  Public  Health  Assessment  is  necessary  to  address  more
complex exposure scenarios.

Conclusion

ATSDR  is  an  agency  with  a  relatively  short  history,  but  a  history  that  spans
much of this nation’s response to health concerns resulting from hazardous environ-
mental exposures.

Beginning with enactment of CERCLA legislation, ATSDR scientists have worked
to  define  a  new  domain  of  Environmental  Public  Health  at  the  community  level,
often  working  beyond  the  reach  of  the  standard  tools  of  public  health.  Some  chal-
lenges  were  apparent  initially:  addressing  questions  for  which  there  were  no
straightforward  answers,  working  in  charged  settings,  and  working  across  cultural
and  institutional  barriers.  With  time,  other  challenges  have  emerged:  integration
across  multiple  chemical  exposure  pathways;  the  rapid  advance  of  science,  leading
to needed changes in Agency procedures; and allocating resources effectively.

While  there  have  been  setbacks  along  the  way,  ATSDR  has  worked  diligently  to
address  the  needs  and  concerns  of  communities  and  the  people  in  those  commu-
nities. Few federal agencies have a stronger track record in working ‘‘on the ground’’
serving local communities. The Agency has developed innovative tools and skill sets
in  carrying  out  its  mission.  It  has  assembled  a  strong  record  of  accomplishment—
protecting  health  near  hazardous  waste  sites,  advancing  science,  and  educating
health professionals and the public.

Nevertheless  I  recognize  the  need  for  ongoing  performance  evaluation  and  con-
stant improvement. This committee has pointed out several areas in which improve-
ment  may  be  needed.  As  described  in  this  testimony,  ATSDR  is  taking  aggressive
action  to  improve  in  four  key  domains:  review  of  the  overall  approach  to  carrying
out  our  mission,  review  of  science  administration  processes,  review  of  management
practices, and improvement of specific procedures.

I  am  committed  to  ongoing  improvement  in  every  aspect  of  ATSDR’s  work,  ena-
bling  us  to  achieve  the  goals  assigned  by  Congress  and  deserved  by  the  American
public: protecting public health from dangerous chemical exposures.

DISCUSSION

MORE ON ANIMALS AS SENTINELS OF HUMAN HEALTH

Chair  MILLER.  Thank  you.  Dr.  Frumkin,  you  saw  the  photo-
graphs in Mr. Mier’s testimony, and his testimony was that no one
in  Midlothian  could  get  anyone  at  ATSDR  to  look  at  the  dogs.
There were a Ms. Markwardt’s dogs, and there were several emails
with  ATSDR  in  which  ATSDR  on  June  23  of  this  year,  so  just  a
few  weeks  ago—January  23.  I  don’t  know  what  I  said.  ‘‘Again,
ATSDR is sympathetic to the plight of your animals but studies in-
volving  animals,  even  the  sentinels  for  human  health  issues,  are
not  activities  engaged  in  or  funded  by  our  agency.’’  Before  that,
ATSDR  had  sent  an  email  or  someone  at  ATSDR  to  Ms.
Markwardt.  ‘‘ATSDR  is  sympathetic  to  the  plight  of  your  animals.
However,  veterinarian  animal  issues  are  outside  of  our  mandated

319

domain.’’ Most recently, January 27, ATSDR wrote Ms. Markwardt
and  again  said  it  was  beyond  the  expertise  or  competence  of  the
Agency and suggested that she talk to someone at Texas A&M. No
one  at  Texas  A&M  has  contacted  her  yet,  and  it  is  not  clear  they
have the funding to pursue any kind of study on the animals.

You have heard the testimony from others about the value of ani-
mals as sentinels, as an indicator of something, some kind of expo-
sure  that  may  affect  us  humans  as  well,  and  I  am  sure  you  re-
viewed the report, our staff report, that shows several instances in
which ATSDR did look to effect on animals as an indicator of effect
on humans. Do you stand by those emails? Do you stand by the re-
fusal  to  look  at  the  dogs  in  Midlothian  or  other  animals  who  have
obvious  health  effects  as  not  reliable  or  beyond  the  duties  of  your
agency?

Dr.  FRUMKIN.  Mr.  Chair,  I  think  this  goes  back  to  a  point  that
Dr.  Ozonoff  made.  The  range  of  expertise  needed  to  serve  commu-
nities  in  a  comprehensive  way  is  enormous,  ranging  from  veteri-
nary  epidemiology  to  social  science  to  meteorology  and  so  on.  We
just don’t have the expertise on board to do good veterinary epide-
miology.  Given  that  we  have  many  more  requests  to  do  studies
than  we  have  resources  to  do  them,  one  of  the  criteria  we  need  to
pay  attention  to  is,  do  we  have  the  expertise  and  capacity  to  do  it
well? In a case like this where it is a very, very heartbreaking situ-
ation,  it  certainly  bears  further  looking  into.  We  just  don’t  have
what  it  takes  to  look  into  it,  and  we  believe  we  would  serve  the
public better to be sure that in this case the pet owner is connected
with  competent  veterinary  epidemiologists  than  to  try  to  take  on
something that is outside our lane.

Chair  MILLER.  But  you  wouldn’t  look  at  a  dog  to  see  if  maybe
that  might  tell  you  something  about  the  effect  there  might  be  on
humans?

Dr.  FRUMKIN.  It  is  a  very  worthwhile  place  to  look.  Animals,
when  they  become  sick,  can  very  well  be  sentinels  for  environ-
mental  exposures.  So  I  don’t  discount  the  importance  of  looking  in
that direction.

Chair  MILLER.  And  you  are  familiar  with  the  1991  National
Academies  Report,  Animals  as  Sentinels  of  Environmental  Health
Hazards?

Dr.  FRUMKIN.  Yes,  as  I  just  said,  animals  are  very  well-recog-
nized  valuable  sentinels,  but  a  small  agency  just  doesn’t  have  the
capacity  to  do  everything  and  that  is  a  particular  line  of  inquiry
that just is outside our skill set.

MORE ON PEER REVIEW

Chair MILLER. Dr. Wilson, you hear the various suggestions that
ATSDR  simply  does  not  do  peer  review  or  infrequently  does,  but
Dr.  Wilson  said  that  there  were  fewer  peer  reviews  of  ATSDR’s
health  assessment  than  most  people  had  fingers  and  toes.  Appar-
ently  Dr.  Wilson  is  trying  to  protect  the  possibility  he  can  return
to being a country music disc jockey if need be. And everyone testi-
fied  that  ATSDR’s  default  is  not  to  seek  peer  review.  It  is  an  ex-
traordinary  circumstance  when  ATSDR  does.  Everyone  seemed  to
think the default should be getting peer review.

320

Why is it that ATSDR does not fairly routinely have your health
assessments,  your  methodology,  your  research,  your  conclusions
peer reviewed?

Dr.  FRUMKIN.  Let  me  differentiate  between  two  kinds  of  prod-
ucts.  There  are  the  scientific  studies  that  we  produce,  and  there
are  the  site-specific  reports.  On  our  scientific  studies,  every  one  of
them is externally peer reviewed. That is not only a matter of good
practice but it is legislatively required, as I am sure your staff has
alerted you.

On the site-specific activities, we are not required to get peer re-
view, and so we have an algorithm that we turn to. It balances the
need  to  get  our  products  out  quickly  with  the  need  to  do  rigorous
science.  The  peer  review  is  very  worthwhile  in  terms  of  assuring
the  quality  of  science  but  does  slow  the  process  down  somewhat.
And  so  there  is  discretion  on  the  part  of  our  program  managers  to
decide  whether  peer  review  is  needed.  Our  Office  of  Science  is  in-
volved  in  that  decision,  and  when  there  is  a  site-specific  report,
that  is  either  in  the  realm  of  uncertain  science  or  is  liable  to  be
controversial or is in some other way appears to benefit from great-
er scrutiny, we do submit that to peer review.

Chair  MILLER.  The  assessment  by  GAO  panel,  or  the  opinion  of
the  GAO  panel  that  site-specific  studies  should  routinely  be  peer
reviewed, you are familiar with that?

Dr. FRUMKIN. Yes, that was well before my time, but I am famil-

iar with it.

Chair MILLER. Okay. And I assume that most people have 20 fin-
gers  and  toes  combined.  Dr.  Wilson’s  estimate  that  there  were
fewer than 20 that had been peer reviewed, is that correct?

Dr. FRUMKIN. I don’t know what number of our products are peer

reviewed. I would have to get back to you on that.

Chair  MILLER.  Well,  in  terms  of  the  public  feeling  some  con-
fidence in an ATSDR study, wouldn’t peer review add to their con-
fidence?

Dr. FRUMKIN. I think peer review would be very helpful, and we
are  very,  very  open  to  discussing  a  more  comprehensive  program
of peer review. We need to be mindful that we have to balance the
need  to  be  expeditious  in  releasing  our  products  with  the  need  to
do the peer review. We heard the observation earlier that our prod-
ucts  take  too  long  to  get  out  the  door,  and  we  have  been  very  con-
cerned about that and we have been working hard to accelerate the
production of our reports. And so we would want to balance the two
goods.  But  I  think  we  are  very  open  to  looking  further  into  more
extensive and regular peer review.

Chair MILLER. My time has expired. Dr. Broun.

HINDRANCES TO ATSDR’S PERFORMANCE

Mr. BROUN. Dr. Frumkin, you sat here through this whole morn-
ing’s  testimony  and  heard  all  these  charges  against  your  agency
and  some  against  you  personally,  and  kind  of  going  along  with
what  the  Chair  started  out  in  the  line  of  questioning,  of  these
charges  against  you,  how  would  you  answer  those—I  know  there
have  been  a  number  of  them  but  the  most  serious  ones  are  mis-
management  and  not  being  scientifically  based  or  honest.  Would
you  please  comment  to  that  and  since  I  just  have  five  minutes,  I

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00328 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

321

wanted  to  ask  a  second  question.  You  can  just  probably  spend  the
next few minutes doing those and my time will be up.

What  are  the  greatest  hindrances  or  stumbling  blocks  for  you
and  your  agency  to  perform  the  mission  that  you  have  been
charged with?

Dr.  FRUMKIN.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Broun.  One  challenge  in  carrying
out  our  mission  is  that  it  is  intrinsically  very  difficult  mission.
When  communities  expect  us  to  come  in  and  have  firm  answers
and when those answers are in many cases elusive, either by their
very  nature  or  because  the  data  we  need  aren’t  available,  then  we
end  up  disappointing  communities  and  our  people  are  very  dis-
appointed in those situations as well.

So  it  may  be  that  the  very  model  of  work  that  we  use,  the  very
kinds  of  services  we  deliver  to  communities  need  to  be  rethought,
and our national conversation aims to do that.

We  don’t  have  the  depth  of  expertise  and  breadth  of  expertise
that  an  agency  charged  with  our  mission  really  ought  to  have.  We
need  to  have  expertise  in  everything  from  meteorology  to  commu-
nication  sciences  to  veterinary  epidemiology,  and  we  don’t  have
that.  We  are  a  very  small  group,  and  in  comparison  to  the  thou-
sands  of  hazardous  waste  sites  that  are  out  there,  the  countless
thousands  of  additional  chemical  releases,  our  small  agency  really
faces a huge challenge quantitatively.

I  don’t  think  that  we  face  the  challenge  of  disloyalty  to  science
or unawareness of the best science or of lack of dedication. I think
we  have  a  very  dedicated  and  caring  workforce,  but  in  the  face  of
those challenges, the job is a tough job.

MORE ON POTENTIAL FIXES

Mr. BROUN. What would you do in the way of trying to overcome
those stumbling blocks or hindrances to your being able to perform
what the communities expect?

Dr. FRUMKIN. Well, I think the steps that I described earlier that
we are now taking to improve our work very much respond to that
question. So at the very large level of looking at our mission—there
were  some  comments  today  about  our  work  plan.  Should  we  dele-
gate more work to the states or less work to the states? Should we
delegate  more  work  to  the  private  sector  or  less?  Those  are  fair
questions  to  ask,  and  we  are  asking  questions  at  that  large  scale
in our national conversation.

We  do  need  to  be  very  attentive  to  good  science  administration,
and  we  need  to  look  at  issues  like  effective  peer  review  and  clear-
ance  and  be  sure  that  we  are  doing  as  well  as  we  can.  We  have
some  suggestions  already  from  this  morning’s  testimony  about
more  extensive  peer  review,  and  that  is  the  kind  of  suggestion  we
need to take very seriously.

At  the  level  of  management  within  the  Agency,  we  need  very
good  management.  We  need  skilled  management  with  human  re-
sources issues and staff capacity building issues and so on attended
to. We are taking a lot of steps in that direction, so I stand by what
we are doing there. And then there are specific procedures that we
could do better, and we are working hard to do better at them.

So I think that sort of thorough, open look, a willingness to iden-
tify  places  where  we  could  do  better  and  then  to  take  advantage

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00329 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

322

of  those  opportunities  really  is  what  we  need  to  have,  and  I  am
proud to say we have that.

Mr. BROUN. Can the private sector handle the functions of doing
these  studies  and  producing  the  scientific  products  that  are  nec-
essary?

Dr. FRUMKIN. In some cases we do do that. We have private con-
tractors who handle some of the preparation of our toxicologic pro-
files.  In  some  cases  when  we  conduct  environmental  sampling,  we
have private contractors who do that. So a certain amount of shar-
ing of this responsibility is very appropriate.

I  do  believe  that  people  expect  their  government  to  protect  their
health,  and  so  I  am  proud  that  we  have  a  core  government  role,
and I think we ought to maintain that role, but I think shared ar-
rangements  between  the  public  and  private  sectors  are  very,  very
practical and we have shown that they can work.

Mr. BROUN. So the answer to that is the State and private sector

can perform these duties if we just enable them to do so?

Dr. FRUMKIN. I think so.
Mr.  BROUN.  Thank  you  very  much.  My  time  is  out  and  I  will

yield back, Mr. Chair.

Chair  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Broun.  Mr.  Rothman  has  joined

us. Do you have questions, Mr. Rothman?

Mr. ROTHMAN. I do indeed. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Chair MILLER. You have five minutes.

MORE ON VIEQUES, PUERTO RICO

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Thank  you.  Thank  you,  Doctor,  for  your  testi-
mony.  I  would  like  to  discuss  with  you  an  example  of  what  is  a
very  disturbing  conclusion  that  ATSDR  has  apparently  rendered
with  regards  to  the  public  health  of  the  community  of  Vieques,
Puerto  Rico.  For  over  60  years,  roughly  200  days  a  year  the  U.S.
Navy  used  the  eastern  end  of  Vieques  to  practice  live  ordinance
training exercises. Numerous studies, both academic and scientific,
have  confirmed  that  levels  of  heavy  metals,  biotoxins,  and  carcino-
gens are sometimes up to 100,000 times higher than the safe levels
in  the  local  ecosystem,  and  the  island  suffers  a  drastically  higher
cancer rate than the rest of Puerto Rico.

I  have  got  a  lot  of  questions,  Mr.  Chair,  which  I  will  submit  for
the  record.  As  many  as  I  can  get  in,  though,  in  my  time  I  would
be grateful to do.

In  2003  following  four  public  health  assessments,  ATSDR  pub-
lished a summary of the Agency’s work that included such observa-
tions that the residents of Vieques have not been exposed to harm-
ful levels of chemicals resulting from Navy training exercises, that
the  bombing  of  the  live  impact  area  has  not  affected  the  drinking
water,  that  levels  of  chemicals  in  Vieques’  soil  are  not  of  public
health  concern,  fish  and  shellfish  are  safe  to  eat  every  day  from
Vieques,  and  other  conclusions  that  seem  to  be  in  conflict  or  con-
tradiction to other independent studies that have found evidence of
potential public health issues that ATSDR was unable to find.

Are  you  aware,  Doctor,  that  the  hair  testing  of  the  people  of
Vieques, for example, provided to the U.S. Navy showed extremely
high  levels  of  mercury  disease,  lead  disease,  cadmium  disease,  ar-
senic disease, and aluminum disease? Doctor?

Dr. FRUMKIN. Mr. Rothman, are you referring to disease or to the

levels of exposure to those metals?

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Level  of  exposure  to  those  metals.  Let  us  start
there.  If  there  is  evidence  of  disease,  I  would  like  to  know  if  you
found that as well.

Dr. FRUMKIN. I am not familiar in detail with all of the data col-
lected  in  Vieques  over  the  years.  Our  agency’s  involvement  in
Vieques  predated  my  arrival  at  the  Agency.  I  do  know  that  there
has  been  sampling  conducted  by  our  people,  and  a  lot  of  sampling
conducted by others and can’t fully explain the results or reconcile
them.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Would you feel comfortable raising your family on

Dr.  FRUMKIN.  I  don’t  know  enough  about  Vieques  to  be  able  to

Vieques today, Doctor?

answer that question.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  It  is  my  understanding  that  the  U.S.  Navy  has
not been asked by ATSDR to provide the kind of relevant informa-
tion  that  I  think  might  clarify  some  of  the  conflict  in  conclusions.
Would  you  have  any  objection  to  requesting  from  the  Navy  that
kind of information?

Dr.  FRUMKIN.  No,  sir.  I  am  very  happy  to  pledge  to  you  moving
out of this hearing to take a fresh look at the Vieques situation and
to  collect  any  data  necessary  to  clarify  the  health  situation  for  the
people there.

Mr. ROTHMAN. That is very good news, Doctor. I understand that
you don’t have enough information. You have committed to getting
more and being open to reexamining this whole issue anew, is that
a fair summary of your statement?

Dr. FRUMKIN. Yes, sir.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Thank  you  very  much,  Doctor.  No  further  ques-

tions, Mr. Chair.

Chair MILLER. Thank you. I do recognize myself for an additional
round  of  questions.  Dr.  Frumkin,  when  I  finished  preparing  my
opening statement I felt bad. It is hard for a southerner to be that
harsh.  We  say  bless  his  heart,  he  means  well,  instead  of  the  boy
is just dumb as a fencepost. It is hard for us to be that critical. But
the  last  second  two  panels  made  me  feel  much  better  about  the
tone of my opening statement.

CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO CRITICISM

You  have  heard  a  lot  of  criticisms  today,  you  know  of  the  GAO
report  that  Dr.  Ozonoff  was  part  of,  in  1992  there  was  a  study
called  Inconclusive  by  Design  that  makes  many  of  the  same  criti-
cisms that we have heard today. I know that was before you joined
ATSDR,  and  certainly  the  problems  with  ATSDR  predates  your
joining  the  Agency,  but  can  you  identify  anything  that  the  Agency
did in response to the GAO study or the study Inconclusive by De-
sign  that  was  scathing  to  respond  to  those  criticisms?  Any  change
the Agency made?

Dr.  FRUMKIN.  Mr.  Chair,  what  I  can  speak  to  is  efforts  over  the
last  three  years,  and  that  has  been  my  time  at  the  Agency.  We
have recognized the need for a thorough look at the way we do our
business. We have recognized the need to do better in many ways.
Many  of  the  criticisms  that  were  leveled  in  those  reports  20  years

ago  are  still  leveled  now,  so  we  need  to  take  those  seriously.  That
is  exactly  the  motivator  for  this  national  conversation  that  we  are
launching. It is meant to be a multi-stakeholder effort, a very seri-
ous  and  probing  effort,  to  ask  over  the  last  20  years  of  our  work,
what  is  going  well,  what  hasn’t  gone  well,  and  what  do  we  need
to do to do much better moving into the future.

Chair MILLER. Not just still but within the last two hours within
this  Committee  room.  You  have  said  that  there  are  constraints  of
budget which I am sure is always true of any Federal Government
agency, and that is some of the reasons that the science isn’t better
than it is or that it is not peer reviewed, that you don’t look at all
the  documents,  you  don’t  go  look  at  the  dogs.  But  you  have  also
heard all the testimony today about the importance of a community
being  able  to  trust  ATSDR’s  assessment  that  if  there  is  not  some-
thing  for  them  to  worry  about,  they  need  to  be  able  to  know  that
that ATSDR assessment is something that they can rely upon. And
you  have  heard  that  communities  can’t  rely  upon  that.  Have  you
considered  whether  it  would  be  better  to  do  fewer  reports  but  do
them  well?  Get  them  peer  reviewed,  have  something  the  commu-
nities can rely upon but that an assessment that is not reliable, is
not credible, is worse than no assessment at all.

Dr. FRUMKIN. One of the very important possible solutions for us
is  to  take  on  fewer  projects  and  to  put  more  resources  and  time
into  each  project  and  do  them  in  more  depth,  and  I  think  that  is
something  we  need  to  consider  very  seriously  as  we  move  forward
with  our  planning.  It  is  also  the  case  that  sometimes  we  do  quite
good work, very good work, but our results are simply not welcome
by  the  community  which  has  other  expectations  than  what  we  can
deliver, and that is not a matter of malfeasance or inability on the
part  of  our  people.  It  is  a  matter  that  some  of  the  questions  that
communities very understandably need to have answered just can’t
be  answered.  And  so  we  need  to  be  very  careful  about  acknowl-
edging  and  when  we  need  to  do  better  in  order  to  win  the  trust  of
the community when we simply need to communicate better and be
more  accountable,  even  when  we  have  unwelcome  news  to  deliver.
Chair  MILLER.  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my  time.  Dr.  Broun,

do you wish to have a second round of questions?

Mr. BROUN. Mr. Chair, thank you. I have a number of questions
that  I  am  going  to  submit  to  the  witness,  and  I  appreciate  your
offer  and  I  am  glad  to  give  you  forbearance  on  time,  so  we  will
work together I think very well.

CLOSING

Chair  MILLER.  Mr.  Rothman  has  left  us.  We  are  now  at  the  end
of  our  hearing.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Frumkin.  Under  the  rules  of  the
Committee,  the  record  will  remain  open  for  two  weeks  for  addi-
tional statements from any Member. I think I neglected to mention
that one of the witnesses, Dr. Cole I think, had—we will admit into
the  record  letters  that  Dr.  Cole  made  part  of  his—appended  to  his
testimony,  and  there  can  be  submissions  of  follow-up  questions
from  the  Committee  for  any  witnesses.  And  all  witnesses  are  now
excused, and the hearing is now adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 12:56 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Salvador  Mier,  Local  Resident,  Midlothian,  Texas;  Former  Director  of

Prevention, Centers for Disease Control

I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  the  following  questions  and  offer

my perception.

As a prelude to my responses, I want to emphasize—public health desperately
needs the mission that gave birth to the ATSDR to be carried out. This mis-
sion  has  never  been  truly  respected  or  realized.  A  culture  of  passive  resistance  by
internal  and  external  forces  was  instituted  at  its  inception  to  keep  ATSDR  from
completing its mission. This well-engrained culture of passive resistance is still very
much alive and pervasive today.

Although disgraceful, the FEMA trailer fiasco was no different than the egregious
1991  ATSDR  political  move  at  reducing  pollution  control  and  cleanup  costs  for  in-
dustry  by  minimizing  and  denying  the  public  health  hazard  of  dioxin.  ATSDR  de-
nied the science then—and contrary to scientific evidence—trivialized dioxin’s prov-
en  and  potential  impact  on  public  health  and  attempted  to  get  other  agencies  to
jump on their bandwagon. The same pattern of trivialization and denial is pervasive
in the majority of ATSDR public health assessments and consultations and in their
Toxicological  Profiles  upon  which  their  findings  are  based.  The  problems  identified
by this Subcommittee are only the tip of the iceberg.

One  only  needs  to  track  forward  the  culture  instilled  by  Dr.  Vernon  N.  Houk,
former  Director,  Center  for  Environmental  Health,  CDC.  In  so  doing  it  should  be
obvious  that  in  order  to  evoke  the  critically  needed  changes  within  ATSDR,  all  di-
rect  or  indirect  proteges  of  Dr.  Houk  currently  in  leadership  above  and  within
ATSDR should be replaced—starting with at a minimum the Director, Coordinating
Center  for  Environmental  Health  and  Injury  Prevention  (CCEHIP),  down  through
at  a  minimum  ATSDR  Director,  Deputy  Director  and  Director,  Division  of  Health
Assessments and Consultations. Merely tossing a new frog into the swamp as Direc-
tor is insufficient to bring about the desired consequences.

Questions submitted by Representative Paul C. Broun
Q1. Can  the  private  sector  or  State  agencies  perform  some  or  all  functions  of
ATSDR? Would this be appropriate? What conflict of interests could arise? How
could you protect against this?

A1. Functions inherent to ATSDR’s mission should be the responsibility of a public
agency—and  the  public  rightfully  expects  this  to  be  a  responsibility  of  a  federal
agency. A federal agency such as ATSDR is (or should be) further removed from the
internal State pressures that impair and compromise a state’s ability to make unbi-
ased  assessments.  Private  and  State  agencies  could  perform  some  functions  of
ATSDR but there are serious conflict of interest issues (especially for State agencies)
that compromise their ability to conduct fair and objective assessments.

Possible Conflict of Interest—State Agencies

In  a  statement  attached  to  my  written  testimony,  Dr.  Al  Armendariz,  School  of
Engineering  at  Southern  Methodist  University  (SMU)  in  Dallas,  Texas,  made  the
following observations to which I concur.

‘‘There  is  an  obvious  potential  for  a  conflict  of  interest  when  the  ATSDR  con-
tracts  with  State  regulatory  agencies  to  perform  health  assessments  or  to  con-
duct  follow-up  environmental  sampling.  [Example]  In  Texas,  the  TCEQ  is  the
State agency that grants permission to facilities in the form of ‘‘permits’’ to emit
pollutants  to  the  atmosphere.  In  the  permit  writing  process,  the  State  agency
is  making  a  legal  statement  that  a  facility  will  not  adversely  impact  public
health.  There  is  a  very  obvious  potential  conflict  of  interest  when  the  same
agency  later  goes  into  the  community  to  do  follow-up  sampling  in  response  to
an  ATSDR  investigation.  A  State  agency  is  essentially  examining  whether  the
facilities to which it granted permission to emit pollutants at an earlier date are
now in fact causing an adverse public health impact. If ATSDR is going to work
with  other  organizations  to  conduct  assessments  or  do  follow-up  sampling,
ATSDR  should  work  with  independent  third  parties  with  no  obvious  conflict  of
interest,  such  as  State  universities  or  schools  of  public  health,  a  Federal  Gov-
ernment contractor, the American Lung Association, etc.’’

327

Possible Conflict of Interest Private Sector

Many  universities,  schools  of  public  health  and  other  health-based  organizations
often  depend  on  grants  from  private  industries  to  fund  many  of  their  research
projects.  The  threat  of  losing  a  grant  becomes  very  real  if  an  organization  engages
in  activities  that  may  not  be  advantageous  for  a  contributing  entity  and  presents
a conflict of interest.

It  is  crucial  to  build  in  safeguards  that  prevent  participation  if  a  poten-
tial  for  conflict  of  interest  exists  whether  it  be  a  State  government  or  an
independent third party.

Problems With State Cooperative Agreements

The  degree  to  which  public  health  issues  conflict  with  industrial  prosperity  con-
cerns  varies  greatly  from  state  to  state.  As  an  example,  in  Texas  there  is  consider-
able  political  and  industry  influence  (some  subliminal  and  some  strongly  overt)  on
the State environmental agency. This tone of supporting industry at the cost of pub-
lic  health  has  been  clearly  set  by  the  State  administration  and  is  vigorously  advo-
cated  and  promoted  by  industry  lobbyists  and  generally  has  been  supported  by  the
State  legislature.  It  would  be  irresponsible  to  pretend  this  is  an  exaggerated  issue.
It is a pervasive observation expressed by diverse groups of stakeholders and should
not be dismissed. In many states the ability for State agencies to make an objective
assessment  of  the  impact  of  toxic  exposure  on  the  communities’  public  health  is
greatly  compromised.  This  is  why  most  communities  turn  to  ATSDR—because  it  is
perceived to be more distant from local political pressures.

Currently, where there is a State cooperative agreement between ATSDR and the
state, ATSDR abdicates the investigative and decision-making responsibility back to
the  state—the  same  institutions  that  previously  failed  the  community.  This  is  a
costly ‘‘no value realized’’ process—an egregious waste of taxpayer’s money.
It  would  be  naı¨ve  to  think  that  ATSDR  can  do  all  of  the  necessary  work  inde-
pendent  of  the  state  but  ATSDR  should  assume  greater  responsibility  for  many  of
the required tasks. Public Health Assessments/Consultations performed under State
Cooperative  Agreements  should  be  severely  limited—particularly  when  all  avenues
within the state have already been exhausted and a community turns to ATSDR as
the  last  resort.  Resources  wasted  under  these  cooperative  agreements
should be re-channeled to improve ATSDR’s methodologies used to identify
suspected  environmental  exposures  to  hazardous  chemicals,  conducting
their  own  assessments/consultation,  improving  quality  control  and  having
their work peer reviewed by external experts.
Q2. To what extent do you attribute the ATSDR’s problems to leadership?
A2. See my opening statement. There appears to be an entrenched institutionalized
culture that has weakened ATSDR’s commitment to objectively temper and counter
external  pressures  and  has  created  internal  weaknesses  that  dissuade  the  Agency
from  fulfilling  its  mission.  Changes  in  this  entrenched  institutionalized  lead-
ership  that  go  deeper  and  higher  than  that  of  the  Director’s  position  are
critical if this culture is to change.
Q3. Do you believe ATSDR attempts to include revolutionary scientific methods and

techniques in their work?
a. If not, how would you propose they better integrate cutting edge science?
b. Is there any risk to getting too far ahead of a technology or method and com-

ing to conclusions that are ultimately proven unfounded?

c. How  would  you  set  up  policies  or  procedures  to  appropriately  manage  and

unitize these innovations?

A3. I believe that there are internal barriers to and deficiencies in easily accessible
scientific  data.  This  make  it  difficult  for  ATSDR  public  health  assessors  to  readily
access and incorporate the evolving science into their decision-making processes.

It appears ATSDR assessors are almost exclusively dependent on summary state-
ments and obsolete ATSDR toxicology profiles. Based on language and references re-
flected in their findings, it appears ATSDR assessors do not have access to evolving
science  or  are  not  allowed  to  work  ‘‘out  of  the  box  established  by  the  ATSDR  Toxi-
cological  Profiles.’’  Language  in  these  Profiles  appears  to  be  the  basis  for  most  ar-
rived conclusions in the assessments/consultations.

In his written testimony to Congress Dr. Howard Frumkin states ‘‘Since its incep-
tion  ATSDR  has  produced  Toxicologic  Profiles  by  reviewing  the  accumulated  lit-
erature at a particular point in time [not at the cutting edge], culminating in a pub-
lication  of  a  monograph  that  promptly  commenced  to  go  out  of  date.  The  Profile

328

would  be  updated  some  years  later  with  a  next  edition,  which  would  rather  soon
become stale.’’

Dr.  Frumkin  stated  that  ATSDR  will  be  replacing  the  ‘‘book  publication’’  model
of  the  Toxicological  Profiles  with  a  more  contemporary  model  based  on  ongoing,
web-based updates of relevant sections as new material becomes available. How cut-
ting  edge  the  science  will  be  depends  on  the  time  lapses  between  the  availability
of the data and the update. ATSDR assessors should have immediate easy ac-
cess  to  all  cutting  edge  scientific  studies  data  bases  and  should  be  man-
dated to incorporate the findings into their conclusions.

It  appears  extensive  data  needs  for  the  Agency  have  not  been  met.  In  his  testi-
mony, Dr. Frumkin acknowledges, ‘‘ATSDR has a limited research capacity relative
to extensive data needs. Although ATSDR has carried out a limited program of tar-
geted research and has worked to identify data gaps—with the extensive data needs
related to toxic exposures, this remains an ongoing challenge for the Agency.’’

Keeping  up  with  science  appears  to  be  a  greater  problem  than  ‘‘getting  ahead  of
science.’’  Hence,  the  question,  ‘‘Is  there  any  risk  to  getting  too  far  ahead  of  a  tech-
nology or method and coming to conclusions that are ultimately proven unfounded?’’
is frustrating.

Let us pretend for a moment that ATSDR indeed accesses the cutting edge science
and  this  science  presents  validated  information  that  warns  us  of  the  need  to  incor-
porate  measures  to  mitigate  harm.  What  is  the  greater  risk—taking  preventa-
tive measures or ignoring emerging science? Protections that mitigate sus-
pected risks can be relaxed if further scientific findings emerge that more
robustly  support  an  alternative  explanation—but  damage  to  human  health
cannot  be  retroactively  mitigated  and  many  illnesses  and  death  cannot  be
undone.

Resources  dedicated  to  establishing  a  more  proficient  science  data  base
and  a  mandate  to  incorporate  cutting  edge  science  into  the  public  health
assessments is critical.
Q4. How  did  your  experiences  with  State  and  local  health  officials  differ  from  that

of ATSDR?
a. Were they better or worse?
b. Do you believe there was enough coordination, too little, or too much?
c. Did you view ATSDR’s work as simply ‘‘rubber-stamping’’ the state’s work, or

did they provide value?

A4. Shortly after ATSDR changed Midlothian’s health assessment to a consultation,
ATSDR made it clear that they were abdicating all of their responsibilities for mak-
ing  decisions  back  to  the  state.  ATSDR  was  to  sign  off  on  it.  This  basically  made
it clear that they would simply be ‘‘rubber-stamping’’ the state’s work.

We  had  very  little  interaction  with  ATSDR—unless  we  pursued  it  and  the  bulk
of the interaction was via e-mail communication. Up until about six to seven months
ago  we  had  frequent  communication  (both  via  telephone  and  e-mail)  with  several
of the State public health agency staff. We have had almost zero communication (ei-
ther  that  we  have  initiated  or  they  have  initiated)  since.  This  July  it  will  be  four
years since we petitioned the ATSDR for a Public Health Assessment.

You  ask,  ‘‘Was  the  state  better  or  worse  than  ATSDR.  For  at  least  20  years  the
community went to the State agencies asking them for a health assessment because
they  were  experiencing  increasing  public  health  problems.  The  community  found
themselves on a merry-go-round. The health department consistently told them that
the environmental agency says that the toxins to which they and their animals were
exposed  was  not  supposed  to  make  them  sick  so  there  was  no  point  in  discussing
or looking at their health issues.

In  desperation  for  trusted  health  information,  the  community  turned  to  ATSDR.
ATSDR  catapulted  them  right  back  on  the  same  merry-go-round.  The  community
ended  up  back  in  the  same  arena—receiving  more  of  the  same.  Was  there  a  dif-
ference? No.
Q5. What was your impression of ATSDR’s coordination with other federal agencies

like EPA?

A5. Since ATSDR was not actively involved with the process, there was no
opportunity to form an impression of ATSDR’s coordination with other fed-
eral agencies.
Q6. How does ATSDR’s level of competence compare to other federal and State enti-

ties charged with protecting public health?
a. Would you characterize the work ATSDR does as a specialized niche?

329

b. Do any other agencies perform this same work?
c. Can you identify any areas of duplication?

A6. Would  I  characterize  the  work  ATSDR  does  as  a  specialized  niche?  Yes.
ATSDR’s  Public  Health  Assessments/Consultations  should  be  a  special  niche—
operating independent of external influences.

Assessing  the  impact  of  toxic  exposure  on  public  health  is  dramatically  different
from most other public health challenges. First, the science of environmental health
is  still  evolving  and  the  challenge  of  attempting  to  associate  environmental  toxins
to  illness  and  disease  is  apparently  extremely  difficult.  Competency  or  lack  of  com-
petency  is  difficult  to  compare  because  ATSDR  (and  other  agencies  working  in  the
environmental health arena) appear to have a strong lack of will, interest or courage
to  attempt  to  associate  illness  and  disease  that  might  be  associated  to  industrial
toxins. Thus, in my opinion, it is not so much competency that sets ATSDR and other
similar agencies apart from other public health entities but rather the mindset in ap-
proaching the public health challenges is drastically different.

Efforts to link epidemiological data to toxic emissions from industry evoke a dras-
tically different set of dynamics and resistance as compared to linking epidemiolog-
ical data with a bacteria or virus as sources. This is especially true when the emis-
sions  are  from  industries  that  are  active  and  remain  an  integral  economic  part  of
the  community.  These  are  very  real  dynamics  that  science  confronts  in  this  arena
and  are  extremely  difficult  to  deal  with  and  cannot  be  dismissed.  To  dismiss  them
is  to  be  naı¨ve  and  irresponsible.  ATSDR  has  a  tendency  to  trivialize  and  deny  the
existence of epidemiological data.

Agencies  involved  in  assessing  the  public  health  impact  of  industrial  toxins  must
make  more  serious  efforts  to  utilize  epidemiology.  Although  epidemiology  is  a  com-
mon  public  health  tool  the  utilization  of  this  instrument  is  almost  non-existent  in
communities impacted by industrial toxins. Time and time again we have been told
by both ATSDR and the State Public Health agency that epidemiology is too expen-
sive, too labor intensive and too difficult in the application to environmental health
issues.

‘‘Do any other agencies perform the same work?’’ Yes, some local and State health
departments  have  environmental  health  components  that  can  perform  some  of  this
work  but  the  level  of  expertise  and  competency  varies  significantly  and  with  some
it is questionable. Also, see previous comments regarding potential conflict of inter-
est.

Are  there  areas  of  duplication?  This  is  a  good  question.  There  may  be  some  that
involve ATSDR, the National Center for Environmental Health (CDC and under the
same  Director)  and  the  National  Institute  for  Environmental  Health  Sciences.  This
should be explored.
Q7. How does ATSDR compare with similar entities in other countries?

a. Do international public heal agencies have similar problems?
b. What do you attribute this to?

A7. I  have  not  studied  similar  entities  outside  the  U.S.  therefore  do  not  feel  quali-
fied to answer any part of this question.

However,  note  the  testimony  from  Dr.  Randall  Parrish,  University  of  Leicester
(UK). Using a readily available tool, Dr. Parrish was able to pick up where ATSDR
left off and identify depleted uranium in people exposed at Colonie, NY. In this situ-
ation I attribute this more to lack of will by ATSDR.
Q8. ATSDR  does  not  do  large-scale  environmental  sampling,  and  relics  upon  the

EPA and states to conduct this work.

Q8a. Do you believe ATSDR should also be doing this work?
A8a. ATSDR  has  the  responsibility  for  scientifically  evaluating  the  ade-
quacy,  effectiveness  and  appropriateness  of  all  data  upon  which  they  will
base  their  decisions—including  environmental  sampling  and  monitoring  (con-
ducted by a State agency or other entity). This is an important fist step in any anal-
yses  they  perform.  If  based  on  science  and  logic  ATSDR  deems  there  are  gaps  and
flaws  with  the  adequacy  of  this  data,  then  EPA,  an  EPA  contractor  or  the  private
sector  could  assume  this  responsibility.  EPA  is  the  logical  federal  agency  for  this
responsibility  because  of  their  expertise.  I  would  assume  that  EPA  also  has  the
budget  capacity  to  consider  undertaking  some  of  these  sampling  activities  (since
frankly this is part of their mission).

Although most State environmental agencies have this capacity they are too often
in  a  compromising  and/or  conflict  of  interest  position  because  they  issue  permits  to
industries  and  legally  certify  that  those  industries  will  not  adversely  impact  the

330

public health of the communities in which they operate. See prior statement regard-
ing potential conflict of interest.
Q8b. How would you suggest we pay for this work?
A8b. Adequate  data  necessary  to  arrive  at  a  scientific  conclusion  is  not  a  luxury
item and should not be considered optional. The primary question should not be how
the  work  should  be  financially  supported  but  rather  how  scientific  conclusions  can
be made without it. We pay for this work regardless of whether it is done by ATSDR
or another entity. The question should be, ‘‘How can we get the most reliable data?’’
ATSDR resources misdirected towards State Cooperative Agreements could be redi-
rected to pay for this work.

When determining cost you must also factor the increased cost of health care that
would  ensue  addressing  illnesses  that  stem  from  our  failure  to  take  adequate  pre-
ventative measures to protect public health.
Q8c. Would this be worth limiting the number of other studies, assessments, or con-

sultations the Agency initiated?

A8c. ATSDR has already instituted a ‘‘shift in product lines’’ downgrading to Health
Consultations,  Exposure  Investigation,  or  Technical  Assists  to  as  they  put  it—‘‘re-
spond more rapidly, and address public concerns more directly—and conserve scarce
resources  to  address  more  complex  exposure  scenarios.’’ Perhaps a closer look at
this  shift  in  product  lines  is  necessary  to  determine  whether  there  was  a
value added or lost. Take Midlothian, Texas as an example.

Midlothian,  located  within  the  DFW  eight-hour  Ozone  Non-attainment  Area,  is  a
complex scenario with the largest concentration of cement kilns and one of the larg-
est  steel  mills  in  the  U.S.  These  processes  alone  emit  a  large  volume  of  chemical
and heavy metal toxins. The circumstances are further confounded because these ce-
ment  kilns  are  classified  as  waste  recyclers  permitted  to  burn  refuse  such  as  tires,
petroleum coke, asphalt roofing, etc. For 20 years the community has been exposed
to hazardous waste incineration—some even before trial testing was completed. TXI
currently  is  permitted  to  burn  hazardous  waste  in  four  outdated  wet  kilns  not  de-
signed  to  burn  hazardous  waste.  These  cement  kilns  are  not  required  to  meet  the
more  stringent  MACT  standards  required  for  commercial  hazardous  waste  inciner-
ators.  Animal  and  human  health  issues  have  been  surfacing  for  almost  20  years.
This is a complex scenario rife with aggregate toxic chemical exposures and multiple
confounding circumstances which logic would tell you would demand a public health
assessment.

Instead of performing a public health assessment ATSDR instituted this ‘‘shift in
product  lines’’  and  downgraded  the  assessment  to  a  ‘‘consultation.’’  And  as  far  as
being  able  to  ‘‘respond  more  rapidly,’’—almost  four  years  later  it  is  still  not  final-
ized. And as far as ‘‘address public concerns more directly’’—the document, and the
comments  by  the  six  scientists  who  reviewed  the  draft  do  not  support  that  the
public’s concerns were addressed.

The  question  to  ask  is,  ‘‘To  what  extent  has  this  ‘‘shift  in  product  lines’’  already

taken place—and has it improved the process and conserved resources?’’
Q9. Please  describe  the  process  that  you  (or  your  community)  went  through  in  peti-

tioning for ATSDR’s help.

Q9a. Was  your  review  ever  downgraded  to  a  health  assessment  or  health  consulta-

tion?

Q9b. Were you consulted in this decision, or were you simply informed by the Agen-

cy?

Q9c. Did you have any ability to appeal this decision?
A9a,b,c. The responses to these questions are all in my written and oral testimony.
Q9d. How  did  this  affect  your  overall  impression  of  the  services  ATSDR  provided?
A9d. My impression was that Midlothian would not be getting a true unbiased pub-
lic  health  assessment  that  would  withstand  the  scrutiny  of  unbiased  scientists.  I
knew that Midlothian’s public health assessment would not be subjected to an inter-
nal  or  external  peer  review.  Therefore  out  of  desperation,  I  appealed  to  the  science
community  for  help  in  reviewing  the  draft  consultation  published  for  public  com-
ment.  Six  scientists  responded.  Their  comments  will  give  you  insight  and  answers
to many of the questions you ask herein.
Q10. Please describe your level of communication with ATSDR.

a. Do you feel this was adequate?

331

b. What do you think they should have done differently?

A10. Once the ATSDR abdicated their responsibility for assessing Midlothian’s pub-
lic  health  to  the  state,  the  bulk  of  our  communication  was  with  the  State  agency
staff.  Basically,  we  feel  ATSDR  should  have  retained  the  responsibility  for  making
this assessment.
Q11. Do you believe ATSDR products accurately communicate agency findings?

a. What are some of the problems you have identified in their reports?
b. How can the Agency be more effective in communicating risks?

A11. It  is  the  weakness  of  and  the  omissions  in  their  findings  more  so  than
ATSDR’s  inability  to  accurately  communicate  these  findings  that  creates  the  prob-
lem. Communicating a concept or conclusion that does not have a solid sci-
entific  basis  and  ignores  ‘‘community  concerns’’  will  always  remain  dif-
ficult.

Dr.  Frumkin’s  statement  that  communities  expect  that  ATSDR  reach  unequivo-

cal conclusions does not accurately represent what communities expect.

Giving reasons such as ‘‘accurate exposure data are often unavailable’’—‘‘accurate
health  data  are  often  unavailable’’—‘‘complete  information  on  toxic  effects  of  many
chemicals is lacking, especially for such outcomes as neurobehavioral, development,
reproductive function, and especially following the types of long-term, low-dose expo-
sures which occur in many communities’’—‘‘scientific data on mixtures to chemicals
is  scanty,’’  Dr.  Frumkin  further  states,  ‘‘Unfortunately,  it  is  not  always  possible  to
reach such [unequivocal] conclusions.

Yet  in  an  effort  to  force  conclusions  into  neat  little  boxes  labeled  ‘‘No  Apparent
Public  Health  Hazard’’  or  ‘‘Indeterminate  Public  Health’’  ATSDR  reaches  ‘‘un-
equivocal’’ conclusions—ignoring all alleged unknowns as if the lack of data
equated  to  no  harm.  Communities  expect  trusted  health  information  based  on
sound science. It is the ‘‘monkey sees no evil’’ game that ATSDR plays that commu-
nities find frustrating. These unknowns should be acknowledged and be part of their
conclusions.

The  proposed  sample  wording/rewording, 

‘‘ATSDR  concludes  that  touching,
breathing,  or  accidentally  eating  zinc  found  in  soil  and  dust  at  the  XYZ  site  is  not
expected to harm people’s health because zinc levels in soil are below levels of health
concern,’’  given  in  Dr.  Frumkin’s  testimony,  as  is  just  an  example  of  an  extension
of gobbledegook. This exampled phraseology is lacking explanatory information that
the public needs and to a large degree is condescending and insults the community’s
intelligence.  It  is  barren  of  the  scientific  basis  (expressed  in  layman’s  terms)  upon
which conclusions are based that the public seeks and would just exacerbate frustra-
tions that currently exists.

Consider  how  lead  is  addressed  as  an  example  and  suggested  clarifica-

tion when less than a Public Health Hazard is issued.

Even though the preponderance of evidence shows that there is no safe blood-lead
level, ATSDR consistently uses—as a refuge to not assess public health impact
at  lower  levels—the  statement  (cut  and  pasted  from  their  Toxicological  Profiles),
‘‘CDC has determined that a blood lead level at or above 10 micrograms per deciliter
(μg/dL)  in  children  indicates  excessive  lead  absorption  and  is  grounds  for  interven-
tion’’—essentially  condoning  10  μg/dL  blood-lead  level  as  an  acceptable
health risk.
If ATSDR continues to refuses to incorporate accumulated blood-lead levels lower
than 10 μg/dL as a health risk, at a minimum, communities seeking trusted health
information deserve this type of explanation:

All scientific research shows there is no known safe level of lead.
Shortly after lead gets into your body, it travels in the blood to the ‘‘soft tissues’’
and organs (such as the liver, kidneys, lungs, brain, spleen, muscles, and heart).
After  several  weeks,  most  of  the  lead  moves  into  your  bones  and  teeth.  In
adults,  about  94  percent  of  the  total  amount  of  lead  in  the  body  is  contained
in  the  bones  and  teeth.  About  73  percent  of  the  lead  in  children’s  bodies  is
stored in their bones. Some of the lead can stay in your bones for decades; how-
ever, some lead can leave your bones and re-enter your blood and organs under
certain  circumstances  (e.g.,  during  pregnancy  and  periods  of  breast  feeding,
after a bone is broken, and during advancing age).
Lead  (from  mother’s  current  exposures,  and  that  leaching  from  the  mothers
bones)  interferes  with  neural  development  in  children  and  developing  fetuses
even  at  extremely  low  levels.  Even  at  very  low  levels,  lead  is  associated  with

332

negative  outcomes  in  children,  including  impaired  cognitive,  motor,  behavioral,
and physical abilities. Fetal lead exposure can cause delay in the embryonic de-
velopment of multiple organ systems, including retardation of cognitive develop-
ment in early childhood.
Recent science associates very low blood-lead levels in adults with cognitive de-
ficiencies, increased deaths from heart disease and stroke and miscarriages.
Deleterious human health effects at blood-lead levels 10 times lower that 10 μg/
dL  have  been  observed.  CDC  recommends  a  blood-lead  level  at  10  μg/dL
as a point of intervention (not as an acceptable level of poisoning or as
an acceptable health risk) because successful chelating treatments below this
level  have  not  been  identified;  therefore,  prevention  of  exposure  is  essential.
(Statements should be foot-noted with applicable studies/references.)

Q12. Are you aware of ATSDR’s recent efforts to improve its processes and manage-

ment?

a. Do you believe they will adequately address your concerns?
b. How would you improve tile Agency’s processes and management (or even cul-

ture)?

A12. I  have  read  some  of  the  Agency’s  proposed  efforts.  These  efforts  to  date  have
not  been  reflected  in  the  quality  of  the  end  products—Public  Health  Assessments/
Consultations.

I  have  a  major  concern  about  the  proposed  ‘‘National  Conversation’’  to  determine
the  ‘‘public  health  approach  to  chemical  exposures.’’  It  appears  to  be  another  form
of  ‘‘passive  resistance’’  to  proactively  addressing  the  issues  that  are  before  ATSDR.
Just  like  public  health  assessments  and  consultations  are  drawn  out  for  years—
keeping  the  public  silenced  and  at  bay,  thinking  that  their  guardian  agencies  are
taking health-protective actions—this ‘‘National Conversation’’ will serve as an infi-
nite diversion—a refuge for inaction.

ATSDR  already  knows  what  they  have  to  do  and  they  have  the  science  to  back
needed  action.  Although  it  is  good  to  keep  dialogue  open  and  consistently  seek  im-
provement, ATSDR just simply needs to start fulfilling its mission.

Agency processes and management practices are fairly simple to correct and mod-
ify.  Agency  mindset  and  culture  appear  to  be  well  engrained  and  institutionalized
over  a  long  period.  Effecting  a  change  in  mindset  and  culture  requires  concerted
proactive action.

Senior  leaders  who  have  maintained  their  positions  in  this  current  environment
are  most  culpable  in  setting  the  existing  mindset  and  culture.  To  effect  desired
changes within the Agency, they need to be replaced. In my opinion, at a minimum,
the  Director,  Coordinating  Center  for  Environmental  Health  and  Injury  Prevention
(CDC), the Director of ATSDR, the Deputy Director and the Director of the Division
of  Health  Assessments  and  Consultations  must  be  replaced.  There  may  be  a  need
to make other personnel changes in this agency but that would require a review by
an outside entity to determine this need.

The  new  CDC  Director  must  clearly  understand  the  ATSDR  mission  and  the  de-
sired mindset and culture necessary in order that ATSDR can carry out its mission.
This understanding is critical to assure that the appropriate replacement staff is ap-
pointed  and  in  turn,  the  new  mindset  mandate  is  translated  to  the  Agency  staff.
Q13. How  can  ATSDR  do  a  better  job  characterizing  past  exposures  given  the  com-

plexity of the task? Do you have any specific recommendations?

A13. ATSDR needs to scientifically validate the merits of environmental data avail-
able.  If  the  system  collecting  data  is  suspect,  then  the  data  produced  are  also  sus-
pect  and  should  not  be  used  as  a  basis  for  ascertaining  exposure  either  past  or
present.

ATSDR  should  review  empirical  evidence  and  determine  whether  this  empirical
evidence  could  be  related  to  exposure.  Empirical  evidence  such  as  birth  defect  and
cancer clusters, animal and dog birth defects and other health issues are sometimes
much better monitors of exposure than any mechanical devices. These are red flags
that should warn that something could be awry and further investigation is needed.
If cumulative body burden and past exposures are material to predicted outcomes
of current exposure assessments, ATSDR should not proceed as if they are not mate-
rial.  Lack  of  data  should  not  be  interpreted  by  ATSDR  as  an  absence  of  a
negative public health impact.

If  past  exposures  are  material  to  locating  people  that  were  in  harms  way  and
needing possible additional medical attention or to assess long-term effect on people
in similar situations, then ATSDR needs to ensure the best tools are used to assess

333

these  past  exposures.  See  Dr.  Randall  Parrish’s  testimony  regarding  ATSDR’s  fail-
ure to use available tools to assess depleted uranium at Colonie, NY.

In some cases, ATSDR should consider implementing CDC’s biomonitoring activi-
ties  to  determine  past  exposure.  This  should  be  given  strong  consideration  in  com-
munities  where  the  environmental  monitoring  system  is  weak  and  thus  the  data
generated  cannot  be  used  as  a  basis  to  accurately  characterize  past  exposure.  This
activity  is  under  the  auspices  of  the  National  Center  for  Environmental  Health  at
CDC and is under the management of the ATSDR Director.
Q14. What  roles  should  ATSDR  play  in  exposure  routes  not  associated  with  haz-

ardous waste (such as food, consumer products, water, and air)?

a. How should the Agency address these issues?
b. Would there be any overlap with other agencies?
c. What should the Agency do when there is a duplication of effort?
d. Do you believe ATSDR’s current mission is appropriate?

A14. ATSDR is the principal federal public health agency charged with the
responsibility  of  evaluating  the  human  health  effects  of  exposure  to  haz-
ardous  substances  in  air,  water,  and  soil  and  the  food  chain.  Other  federal
agencies  already  have  responsibility  for  assuring  the  safety,  efficacy,  and  security
of  food,  drugs  and  other  consumer  products.  Although  their  paths  may  sometimes
cross,  the  roles  and  scope  of  their  activities  are  very  different.  ATSDR  needs  to  do
a better job with its current responsibilities and not even contemplate the expansion
of their role.

Dr. Frumkin’s expression in his testimony of concern about heavy emphasis on
hazardous waste sites is puzzling since this encompasses the bulk of ATSDR’s re-
sponsibilities.  The  statement,  ‘‘However,  a  variety  of  other  sources,  such  as  food,
consumer  products,  water,  and  air  are  well  recognized,  and  for  many  Americans
these, not hazardous waste sites, are the predominant pathways of exposure to chemi-
cals,’’ is worrisome. Determining whether the toxins/chemicals from the hazardous
waste  sites  are  contaminating  the  food,  water  and  air  to  is  within  ATSDR’s  scope
of  responsibility.  Furthermore  for  many  Americans  living  in,  near  or  on  hazardous
waste  sites—what  impacts  their  health  is  not  an  either  or  situation.  Expo-
sure  to  chemicals  and  toxins  from  these  hazardous  waste  sites  is  a  con-
founding factor on top of the normal body burden of toxins experienced by
the many Americans.

ATSDR’s  current  mission  is  extremely  appropriate  and  critical  to  the

public health of this nation—it just needs to be carried out.

Continued failure to properly assess the impact from toxic exposures or to be clear
about  potential  health  impacts  will  continue  to  imperil  the  Nation’s  public  health.
It  will  be  a  signal  to  industries  and  the  environmental  agencies  that  the  edge  has
not yet been reached and activities that produce further increases in toxic emissions
may be possible or that further preventative measures are not necessary.

Those opposed to the success of ATSDR’s mandated mission would realize

a great victory should ATSDR maintain the status quo or be abolished.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Randall  R.  Parrish,  Head,  Natural  Environmental  Research  Council

(NERC) Isotope Geosciences Laboratory, British Geological Survey

Answers  to  questions  will  refer  to  the  question  numbers  1  to  14;  several  of  the
questions refer broadly to interactions witnesses have had with ATSDR; in my par-
ticular situation these are not relevant since I have never had any direct or indirect
contact with ATSDR. ATSDR has not contacted me with regards to my work at any
time.  I  have  not  attempted  to  contact  ATSDR  either.  My  contribution  has  mainly
been in evaluating the ATSDR Health Consultation done at Colonie, NY.

Questions submitted by Representative Paul C. Broun
Q1. Can  the  private  sector  or  State  agencies  perform  some  or  all  of  the  functions  of

ATSDR?
a. Could they do it better?
b. Would this be appropriate?
c. What conflict of interests could arise?
d. How could you protect against this?

A1. As  I  live  in  the  UK  I  do  not  feel  I  have  sufficient  knowledge  of  either  State
agencies or private sector organizations to address this question.
Q2. To what extent do you attribute the ATSDR’s problems to leadership?
A2. I  express  my  personal  view  here:  I  do  feel  this  is  in  part  a  leadership  issue.
In  large  organizations  leadership  sets  the  tone  and  agenda.  I  listened  to  the  re-
sponse  of  the  Director  of  ATSDR  during  testimony  and  generally  felt  that  his  com-
ments  indicated  to  me  that  he  had  failed  to  set  a  clear  agenda  of  priorities  for  the
Agency,  and  that  he  was  probably  out  of  his  depth,  regardless  of  how  good  an  aca-
demic  scientist  he  is  or  was  in  his  previous  role.  Weak  leadership  has  undoubtedly
contributed  to  the  acute  difficulties  the  Agency  is  in  now.  Poor  judgment  near  or
at  the  top  has  led  to  some  of  the  imprudent  actions—especially  the  formaldehyde
issue.
Q3. Do you believe ATSDR attempts to include revolutionary scientific methods and

techniques in their work?
a. If not, how would you propose they better integrate cutting edge science?
b. Is there any risk to getting too far ahead of a technology or method and com-

ing to conclusions that are ultimately proven unfounded?

c. How would you set up policies or procedures to appropriately manage and uti-

lize these innovations?

A3. In  my  experience  at  Colonie,  NY,  there  is  little  doubt  that  the  Agency  failed
to take account of and incorporate advances in methods of toxic exposure detection.
The  Agency  should  ask  the  broad  questions—for  example—what  levels  of  exposure
might  have  occurred  and  can  these  be  documented;  can  modeling  be  used  to  esti-
mate  better  what  inhalation  of  toxic  uranium  oxide  might  have  occurred?  These
types  of  questions  can  be  addressed.  In  my  opinion  the  Agency  need  not  have  full
expertise within its own staff to answer all possible technological questions, but they
should  have  an  outward-facing  comprehensive  knowledge  of  where  to  find  the  ex-
perts  and  how  to  engage  them  as  consultants,  advisors,  or  as  analysts.  If  they  em-
braced this type of ethos, they could retain the capability of using the best methods
and  best  science  while  not  being  compelled  to  find  this  top  notch  expertise  always
within  house.  I  suspect  the  Agency  has  the  worst  of  both  worlds—neither  the  ex-
perts in house nor the interest to seek outside expertise. This would lead to a highly
insular organization that would, over time, become more and more inadequate given
its remit. I do not have sufficient current knowledge of the organization to comment
much  further  except  to  say  that  what  I  am  suggesting  is  not  rocket  science—just
pretty  much  down  to  Earth  common  sense.  If  they  want  to  get  to  the  bottom  of  an
issue, you need to seek the best experts and use the most appropriate tools. I would
also say that if the Agency always requires the use of routine methods that are com-
mon and well established, and if they require any method to be formally accredited
in a lab, then they will miss major opportunities because the common methods may
not be appropriate for unusual requirements.
Q4. How  did  your  experiences  with  State  and  local  health  officials  differ  from  that

of ATSDR?

a. Were they better or worse?
b. Do you believe there was enough coordination, too little, or too much?
c. Did you view ATSDR’s work as simply ‘‘rubber-stamping’’ the state’s work, or

did they provide value?

A4. I felt that the quality of the ATSDR health consultation at Colonie, NY was fair
at  best,  but  to  be  fair,  that  of  the  NY  agencies  were  no  better.  Neither  agency
seemed  to  feel  the  need  to  do  any  proper  study  of  the  situation.  Both  appeared  to
act not in a proactive precautionary way, but almost entirely in a response to public
pressure. In neither case was protecting public health at the top of the agenda. Nei-
ther  agencies  appeared  to  satisfy  the  concerns  of  the  public  in  any  substantial  way
and this I consider to be a failure of will.
Q5. What was your impression of ATSDR’s coordination with other federal agencies

like EPA?

A5. No comment, not enough knowledge.
Q6. How does ATSDR’s level of competence compare to other federal and State enti-

ties charged with protecting public health?
a. Would you characterize the work ATSDR does as a specialized niche?
b. Do any other agencies perform this same work?
c. Can you identify any areas of duplication?

A6. No comment, not enough knowledge.
Q7. How does ATSDR compare with similar entities in other countries?
a. Do international public health agencies have similar problems?
b. What do you attribute this to?

A7. Hard  to  answer.  In  the  UK  we  have  the  Health  Protection  Agency  and  quite
rigorous  standards  on  brownfield  or  toxic  substance  sites  and  there  is  a  much
stronger linkage between governmental levels dealing with these sort of things, un-
like  the  diffuse  jurisdictions  in  the  U.S.;  of  course  the  UK  is  much  smaller  and  the
situation  is  different.  I  get  the  impression  that  there  is  more  proactive  pre-
cautionary  work  done  in  the  UK  than  the  U.S.  given  like  for  like  situations.  The
U.S.  has  a  long  history  of  companies  with  long  standing  links  to  the  U.S.  military
and  U.S.  DOE  being  allowed  to  pollute  badly  and  get  away  with  it,  at  taxpayers’
expense.  In  the  UK  there  is  a  ‘polluter  pays’  default  policy,  which  requires  costs  to
be  borne  primarily  by  those  that  do  the  polluting.  For  example  in  the  Colonie,  NY
area,  the  DOE-contracted  National  Lead  Industries  did  all  the  polluting  and  paid
for  none  of  the  cleanup,  with  the  government  willingly  picking  up  the  tab  for  the
mess ($190M) and still with no agency seemingly interested in evaluating the public
health implications of it all. National Lead has had a habit of abandoning sites and
moving  on.  The  ethos  that  allows  this  to  continue  should  be  changed—this  is  long
overdue but unfortunately an entrenched pattern.
Q8. ATSDR  does  not  do  large  scale  environmental  sampling,  and  relies  upon  the

EPA and states to conduct this work.
a. Do you believe ATSDR should also be doing this work?
b. How would you suggest we pay for this work?
c. Would this be worth limiting the number of other studies, assessments, or con-

sultations the Agency initiated?

A8. I  think  the  most  effective  advice  I  could  give  ATSDR  is  to  prioritize  its  many
projects and for those they commit to, to do them well, rather than cover all of them
poorly. This again, is just common sense. They need to re-establish their credibility
and  they  have  to  do  excellent  and  thorough  work  to  achieve  this.  If  their  resources
are  insufficient  to  do  this  at  all  sites,  then  they  either  need  additional  resources,
or  need  to  do  fewer  of  them.  All  of  this  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  they  also
need to root out systemic problems within the Agency that prevent them from being
efficient and doing the best science.
Q9. Please  describe  the  process  that  you  (or  your  community)  went  through  in  peti-

tioning for ATSDR’s help.
a. Was your review ever downgraded to a health assessment or health consulta-

tion?

b. Were you consulted in this decision, or were you simply informed by the Agen-

cy?

c. Did you have any ability to appeal this decision?
d. How did this affect your overall impression of the services ATSDR provided?
A9. See  the  preface;  I  have  had  no  contact  either  way  with  the  Agency—they  have
not  contacted  me  nor  have  I  contacted  them.  They  clearly  had  something  to  gain
from  contacting  me,  but  on  the  basis  of  their  report,  I  felt  that  it  was  sufficiently
superficial  and  in  part  ill-informed  that  I  was  unlikely  to  gain  any  new  knowledge
of the Colonie Site by contacting them.
Q10. Please describe your level of communication with ATSDR.

a. Do you feel this was adequate?
b. What do you think they should have done differently?

A10. See the preface; I have had no contact either way with the Agency—they have
not  contacted  me  nor  have  I  contacted  them.  They  clearly  had  something  to  gain
from  contacting  me,  but  on  the  basis  of  their  report,  I  felt  that  it  was  sufficiently
superficial  and  in  part  ill-informed  that  I  was  unlikely  to  gain  any  new  knowledge
of the Colonie Site by contacting them.
Q11. Do you believe ATSDR products accurately communicate agency findings?

a. What are some of the problems you have identified in their reports?
b. How can the Agency be more effective in communicating risks?

A11. I detailed what I felt were failings in the Colonie Health Consultation in some
detail  in  my  original  testimony,  which  is  available;  I  refer  the  Committee  to  this.
Q12. Are you aware of ATSDR’s recent efforts to improve its processes and manage-

ment?

a. Do you believe they will adequately address your concerns?
b. How would you improve the Agency’s processes and management (or even cul-

ture)?

A12. No,  I  am  not  really  aware  of  what  if  any  progress  has  been  made.  Little  or
none of this was evident during the Committee hearing of 12 March, nor was it con-
vincingly  made  clear  in  the  written  testimony  materials.  I  would  not  be  surprised
if any ‘progress’ was instead relatively superficial. My personal opinion here is that
the  Agency  is  unlikely  to  recover  to  an  acceptable  state  without  major  leadership
change through the fabric of the whole senior leadership layer at ATSDR, but again,
I do not have detailed knowledge.
Q13. How can ATSDR do a better job characterizing past exposures given complexity

of the task?

a. Do you have any specific recommendations?

A13. This  is  a  very  important  question  and  gets  at  the  heart  of  the  public  health
issue  of  sites  that  have  historic  rather  than  active  pollution  signatures.  Many  toxic
substances  produce  health  impacts  many  years  after  exposure  and  it  is  therefore
ESSENTIAL  that  the  best  and  most  innovative  methods  be  used  to  attempt  to  as-
sess  and  detect  such  exposures  and  try  to  quantify  them,  so  that  health  outcomes
might  be  evaluated  against  the  exposure  data  in  order  test  linkages.  The  Colonie,
NY  example  is  a  perfect  illustration  of  the  need  for  ATSDR  to  do  better.  If  as  oc-
curred,  the  Agency  assesses  the  current  information  and  concludes  there  was  a
major  health  risk,  but  then  says  it  can  do  nothing  because  it  happened  20  years
earlier,  well  that  just  isn’t  good  enough.  Our  group  as  you  know  come  along  right
afterwards  and  did  the  work  that  the  ATSDR  should  have  realized  could  be  done.
Neither  ATSDR  nor  the  NY  agencies  seemed  the  least  inclined  to  pursue  the  issue
and  instead  they  appeared  to  fail  to  even  appreciate  that  health  consequences  may
persist.  In  my  opinion  (as  detailed  in  my  written  testimony)  they  badly  misunder-
stood  many  aspects  of  this  problem  and  largely  missed  the  point—a  demonstration
of  inadequate  knowledge  of  the  science  and  issues.  If  they  need  to  know  what  the
past exposure might have been, the Agency could commission the best labs (private
or  public  sector)  to  develop  such  tests  when  such  tests  (with  their  high  sensitivity
requirements)  are  unavailable  via  routine  methods.  This  is  what  the  UK  did  in
order  to  satisfy  Gulf  War  veterans  who  had  persistent  concerns  about  exposure  to
depleted  uranium  munitions.  If  the  methods  don’t  exist  to  detect  a  substance  re-
tained  in  the  body  from  an  historic  exposure,  then  talk  to  the  experts  and  commis-
sion new methods to be developed.
Q14. What  role  should  ATSDR  play  in  exposure  routes  not  associated  with  haz-

ardous waste (such as food, consumer products, water, and air)

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Jeffrey  C.  Camplin,  President,  Camplin  Environmental  Services,  Inc.

Questions submitted by Representative Paul C. Broun
Q1. Can  the  private  sector  or  State  agencies  perform  some  or  all  of  the  functions  of

ATSDR?

A1. A  major  problem  with  ATSDR  research  and  studies  is  that  private  sector  and
State agencies perform much of their work in an unsupervised manner. I have iden-
tified many reports performed in the Chicago area regarding asbestos where ATSDR
has allowed State agencies to perform incredibly faulty Public Health Assessments.
ATSDR then ‘‘rubber stamps’’ these reports without reviewing their accuracy. In an-
other  case,  ATSDR  funded  a  study  by  the  University  of  Illinois  at  Chicago  School
of Public Health that also contained flaws. When I complained to ATSDR about the
poor  quality  of  the  study  they  funded  I  was  told  by  ATSDR  leadership  that  it  was
not their report and they could not require any changes. When I told them that all
ATSDR funded studies must follow their quality guidelines ATSDR stood silent. To
summarize,  ATSDR  needs  to  focus  on  ‘‘accountability’’  of  their  own  staff  and  those
partners  they  delegate  work  to.  Without  accountability  the  flawed  studies  will  con-
tinue.
Q2. To what extent to you attribute the ATSDR’s problems to Leadership?
A2. Again, the leadership fails to hold their agency accountable for their work prod-
ucts.  When  I  challenged  the  flawed  studies  by  State  agencies  ‘‘rubber  stamped’’  by
ATSDR in Illinois, my challenges were not addressed. I wrote specifically to ATSDR,
CDC, and HHS leadership and was responded to with form letters that ignored my
challenges.  In  one  case  I  filed  an  ethics  complaint  against  ATSDR  staff  that  dis-
turbed  asbestos  contaminated  sand  during  an  exposure  study  while  families  were
on  the  beach.  The  ATSDR  staff  had  personal  protective  equipment  on  while  they
exposed families to asbestos fibers. I was told by ATSDR leadership that their staff
was  ethical  and  only  perform  work  in  a  professional  manner.  Yet  I  had  video  and
photos  of  the  egregious  behavior  that  ATSDR  refused  to  comment  on.  The  leader-
ship  is  arrogant  and  complacent.  ATSDR  will  continue  to  generate  flawed  work
products  as  long  as  the  leadership  is  complacent  and  does  not  hold  their  staff  or
partners accountable for their flawed work.
Q3. Do you believe ATSDR attempts to include revolutionary scientific methods and

techniques in their work?

A3. It  is  the  exact  opposite:  ATSDR  uses  outdated,  flawed,  and  unscientifically
modified  methods  to  perform  their  work.  All  of  their  asbestos  studies  contain  nu-
merous  modifications  and  limitations  which  skew  and  downplay  the  toxicological
findings  of  their  studies.  All  of  their  asbestos  pubic  health  assessments  and  con-
sultations use a risk model that they admit is inaccurate and outdated. Yet instead
of  using  more  accurate  risk  models,  ATSDR  clings  to  the  outdated  model.  ATSDR
simply  adds  disclaimers  to  their  report  that  state  the  risk  from  asbestos  is  signifi-
cantly underestimated. This is unacceptable. However, ATSDR leadership refuses to
acknowledge the use of better scientific methods. They won’t even run a side by side
comparison of the outdated risk models to more current scientific methods and tech-
niques  in  their  work.  This  is  unacceptable  and  a  major  scientific  flaw  in  ATSDR
studies.
Q4. How  did  your  experience  with  State  and  local  health  officials  differ  from  that

of ATSDR?

A4. State  and  local  agency  reports  were  definitely  ‘‘rubber  stamped’’  by  ATSDR.
This is a problem when State and local agencies also participated in studies run by
ATSDR  staff.  ATSDR,  State,  and  local  agencies  play  off  each  other  when  their  re-
ports  are  challenged.  ATSDR  will  say  that  the  state  had  control,  while  the  state
might  say  the  local  agency  actually  made  key  decisions,  while  the  local  agencies
point the fingers back at the state and ATSDR. Draft documents and e-mail are not
subject  to  FOIA  so  it  is  impossible  for  the  public  to  determine  who  actually  made
any  decisions  on  studies.  ATSDR  generally  fights  all  FOIA’s.  It  would  be  helpful  if
this  agency  was  more  transparent.  Also,  when  State  or  local  agencies  will  not  re-
spond  to  FOIA’s  I  generally  requested  the  information  from  ATSDR.  ATSDR  would
state  that  they  would  not  give  me  information  from  their  files  from  other  agencies
and  that  I  would  have  to  get  any  documents  from  those  agencies.  Again,  ATSDR

339

promotes an atmosphere of secrecy to impede any accountability of responsible par-
ties; particularly of their own staff.
Q5. What was your impression of ATSDR’s coordination with other federal agencies

like EPA?

A5. ATSDR  and  EPA  play  games  with  consultations  and  Public  Health  Assess-
ments. For instance, EPA performed an asbestos study at Illinois Beach State Park
in 2007. ATSDR helped them develop the study, they were present at the site when
the  study  was  performed,  and  they  even  participated  in  the  study  by  disturbing
beach  sand  and  wearing  air  monitoring  equipment.  ATSDR  Region  5  staff  did  all
of this. The same staffer from ATSDR Region 5 also helped review the study. Then
EPA asked ATSDR to review the study as though it was the first time ATSDR had
seen  the  report.  Region  5  ATSDR  then  asked  the  EPA’s  TRW  asbestos  group  to  re-
view  their  risk  assessment.  However,  Region  5  ATSDR  staffer  who  participated  in
the  testing  and  who  was  preparing  the  risk  assessment  was  also  a  member  of  the
EPA’s TRW asbestos group. In the final risk assessment opinion the ATSDR Region
5 staffer documented the process as though he had no involvement other than being
the risk assessor. In reality he had been involved in the entire process from design
to  final  report  to  peer  review  (of  his  own  work).  The  EPA  needed  a  study  that  said
the asbestos risks were low because of their involvement with bungling an asbestos
Superfund  site  that  created  the  contamination.  ATSDR  played  along  with  EPA  the
entire  way  to  make  sure  the  testing  was  rigged  and  the  risk  models  were  flawed.
The  ATSDR  staff  also  made  sure  he  was  involved  in  the  peer  review  so  his  work
product would not be challenged. This is not transparency or ‘‘independent’’ peer re-
view.  This  is  rigging  a  study  with  the  EPA  to  cover-up  the  mistakes  of  their  past
flawed work product.
Q6. How does ATSDR’s level of competence compare to other federal and State enti-

ties charged with protecting public health?

A6. I believe that ATSDR has the potential to generate very competent work. How-
ever,  the  leadership  of  ATSDR  has  developed  a  culture  where  their  work  supports
preconceived conclusions by rigging studies and the data. ATSDR is very competent
in  arrogantly  generating  flawed  work  products.  They  know  that  there  are  not  too
many  others  who  have  the  knowledge  to  challenge  them.  When  someone  does  chal-
lenge them they arrogantly hide behind the integrity of the Agency and their many
credentials.  They  cannot  handle  the  truth.  ATSDR  leadership  and  staff  are  very
smart.  Unfortunately  they  do  not  use  their  knowledge  to  promote  public  health.
They use their expertise to cover-up for errors made by other agencies.
Q7. How does ATSDR compare with entities in other countries?
A7. I  am  working  with  the  Italian  government  to  write  a  paper  on  how  asbestos
contaminated shorelines have been addressed by the U.S. vs. Italy. The Italian gov-
ernment  errs  on  the  side  of  caution  when  risks  from  asbestos  are  unknown.  The
Italian  government  was  shocked  to  hear  how  ATSDR  was  estimating  risk  from  as-
bestos contamination along the Illinois Lake Michigan shoreline. I have been asked
by  the  Italian  government  to  participate  on  their  scientific  review  panel  when  they
host the World Asbestos Conference later this year in Italy. Many other nations will
be  presenting  at  this  conference.  Most  countries  look  to  the  U.S.  for  leadership  on
pubic  health  and  toxicological  studies.  However,  they  have  become  just  as  dis-
appointed  as  I  have  been  with  the  quality  of  their  work.  ATSDR  does  not  act  in  a
precautionary manner unlike most European countries. ATSDR is sliding backwards
as the rest of the world passes them by.
Q8. ATSDR  does  not  do  large  scale  environmental  sampling  and  relies  upon  the
EPA  and  states  to  conduct  this  work.  Do  you  believe  ATSDR  should  do  this
work?

A8. ATSDR actually did some asbestos testing in Illinois. I video taped some of the
testing where ATSDR staff from Region 5 and the Atlanta office exposed the public
during  their  testing.  I  filed  an  ethics  complaint  against  them.  ATSDR  concluded
their  work  did  not  pose  a  risk  to  human  health.  However,  when  they  asked  Region
5  EPA  to  provide  comments,  EPA  found  ‘‘extremely  high  exposures’’  that  ATSDR
downplayed.  ATSDR  published  their  flawed  report  anyway  stating  it  was  their  re-
port and EPA had no jurisdiction. ATSDR should not be doing testing!

Yet there is also a problem with others doing the testing. ATSDR generally takes
the  data  from  their  ‘‘partners’’  study  at  face  value.  There  is  no  validity  or  accuracy
checks  done  on  the  data.  I  have  found  significant  problems  with  data  used  by
ATSDR  in  their  studies.  ATSDR  never.  seems  to  review  or  reject  ANY  data.  They
just  take  the  numbers  and  plug  them  into  their  outdated  risk  models  and  conclude

340

everything is just fine. The solution is to hold ATSDR accountable for verifying the
integrity  of  data  that  they  use  in  their  studies.  ATSDR  must  be  the  Agency  that
independently  verifies  that  data  used  in  their  risk  assessments  is  accurate.  Right
now they do not do this, at least with asbestos studies.
Q9. Please  describe  the  process  that  you  (or  your  community)  went  through  in  peti-

tioning for ATSDR’s help.
a. Was your review ever downgraded to a health assessment or health consulta-

tion?

b. Were you consulted in this decision, or were you simply informed by the Agen-

cy?

c. Did you have any ability to appeal this decision?
d. How did this affect your overall impression of the services ATSDR provided?
A9. WE  DID  NOT  PETITION  FOR  ATSDR’s  HELP.  WE  CHALLENGED  THEIR
FLAWED  DATA  AND  ASKED  FOR  BETTER  STUDIES  AND  MORE  ACCURATE
RISK ASSESSMENTS. ATSDR REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR PAST ER-
RORS  AND  FLAWS  IN  THEIR  STUDIES.  ATSDR  CONTINUED  TO  GENERATE
NEW TESTING FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF COVERING UP THEIR FLAWED
STUDIES, NOT TO IMPROVE UPON THEIR FLAWED WORK.
Q10. Please describe your level of communication with ATSDR.
A10. I  have  challenged  their  flawed  work  through  their  information  quality  guide-
lines  to  no  avail.  I  also  appealed  their  decisions  without  having  my  concerns  ad-
dressed in their responses. All I have ever asked for is ANSWERS to the questions
I  posed  to  them  about  the  quality  of  their  reports  and  studies.  ATSDR  (from  the
top down) ignores any challenges and provides responses that avoid the actual chal-
lenge. There should be an independent review of ATSDR’s responses to information
quality  challenges.  Right  now  there  is  no  accountability  for  their  non-responses  to
legitimate challenges and concerns.
Q11. Do you believe ATSDR products accurately communicate agency findings?
A11. NO! ATSDR loads up their studies with all kinds of limitations and qualifiers
that significantly impact the accuracy of their findings. Then ATSDR portrays their
findings (with great confidence) that everything is fine. Yet buried in the report are
these  significant  limitation  and  qualifiers  that  indicate  how  flawed  the  study  actu-
ally is. ATSDR needs to communicate just how unreliable their information actually
is. Better yet, they should just do more accurate testing. ATSDR serves the polluter
by  generating  ‘‘gray  area’’  studies  that  don’t  really  say  one  way  or  the  other  if  a
hazard  exists.  This  is  another  way  ATSDR  performs  studies  that  harm  public
health.
Q12. Are you aware of ATSDR’s recent efforts to improve its processes and manage-

ment?

A12. There  are  no  improvements.  ATSDR  already  has  good  policies  and  structure.
The  leadership  is  the  problem.  Since  the  leadership  has  not  changed  I  find  it  hard
to  believe  anything  has  improved.  What  evidence  exists  that  anything  has  im-
proved?  I  know  in  1991  ATSDR  said  they  were  going  to  improve  and  they  didn’t.
Actions speak louder than words. What has really changed and what is the evidence
that  has  been  verified  by  an  independent  agency.  I  don’t  believe  Dr.  Frumkin’s
empty  words  that  things  are  changing.  According  to  Dr.  Frumkin’s  arrogant  testi-
mony  before  the  Subcommittee,  ‘‘I  am  proud  of  the  excellent  work  we  do  at  hun-
dreds of sites nationally. I recognize that even excellent work has room for improve-
ment’’ (line 2229). I do not think that ATSDR was ridiculed back in 1991 or by this
subcommittee  for  improving  upon  their  ‘‘excellent’’  work.  ATSDR  continually  gen-
erates  flawed  work  products  that  harm  public  health.  Major  changes  need  to  take
place.  Leadership  of  ATSDR  must  be  held  accountable.  If  ATSDR  leadership  is  not
held accountable, their complacency will continue.
Q13. How  can  ATSDR  do  a  better  job  characterizing  past  exposures  given  the  com-

plexity of the task?

A13. ATSDR  needs  to  use  accurate  risk  models.  For  asbestos,  ATSDR  knowingly
uses  outdated  risk  models  to  calculate  risk.  ATSDR  needs  to  make  great  improve-
ments with how they assess exposures to asbestos.
Q14. What  role  should  ATSDR  play  in  exposure  routes  not  associated  with  haz-

ardous waste (such as food, consumer products, water, and air)?

341

A14. ATSDR  needs  to  take  a  more  holistic  approach  to  public  health  assessments.
Most  times  they  put  blinders  on  and  only  look  at  risks  from  the  perspective  of  a
certain hazardous waste in a certain location. In reality, the public has multiple ex-
posures  from  a  variety  of  sources.  The  risk  from  one  specific  site  might  not  be
enough  to  declare  a  significant  risk.  However,  when  that  risk  is  added  to  similar
risks in nearby areas or through other pathways the risk rises to a level of concern.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Ronnie  D.  Wilson,  Associate  Professor,  Central  Michigan  University;

Former Ombudsman, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry

Questions submitted by Representative Paul C. Broun
Q1. Prior to the establishment of ATSDR, how was public health protected?

a. What role did academia play?
b. What role does academia play now?
c. What role does the private sector play?
d. How does this compare to now?
e. Has the role of protecting public health simply shifted from the private sector

to the public sector?

A1. Prior  to  the  creation  of  ATSDR,  little  was  known  about  the  health  effects  of
toxic waste exposures. Some research had been conducted by academia (often funded
by  or  in  conjunction  with  the  private  sector)  and  some  by  EPA.  There  was  a  huge
gap in knowledge and there was no regulatory or legislative mandate to fill the void.
Other than academia, little work in the private sector has transpired to protect pub-
lic health from environmental exposures.

Although  academia  does  play  a  role,  ATSDR  has  provided  funding  and  oversight
for much of the academic research. ATSDR has also conducted important studies on
the health effects of environmental exposures.

With  no  regulatory  or  legislative  mandate,  outside  academia  little  research  has

been conducted by the private sector.
Q2. To what extent do you attribute the ATSDR’s problem to leadership?
A2. Many,  both  within  and  outside  the  Agency,  feel  that  the  present  leadership  is
a  major  portion  of  the  problem  with  and  within  ATSDR.  To  be  fair  however,  con-
ducting research in environmental health and promoting public health is sometimes
difficult  and  involves  a  high  degree  of  complexity.  Mistakes  can  be  made  with  the
best intentions. However, no matter the intent, mistakes have occurred and leader-
ship has known about ATSDR’s deficiencies and has failed to take corrective action.
Further,  ATSDR  leadership  has  become  a  poster  child  for  micro-management,
even to the point of making determinations regarding the exact words are to be used
in health assessments, studies and consultations. While ATSDR’s leadership may be
talented,  they  are  not,  and  will  never  be  experts  in  everything,  yet  no  matter  what
the  issue  or  the  science  involved,  leadership  can,  and  will,  mandate  their  opinion
over that of those who are indeed experts—often with a bit of world renown. A per-
fect example is the Katrina Trailers in which management refused to recognize the
dangers  and  sought  to  cover  up  the  issue  and  ultimately  forced  the  removal  of  a
senior scientist at great expense to the taxpayers.
Q3. Can  the  private  sector  or  State  agencies  perform  some  or  all  of  the  functions  of

ATSDR?
a. Could they do it better?
b. Would this be appropriate?
c. What conflicts of interests could arise?
d. How could you protect against this?

A3. ATSDR partners with academia and State government to conduct research and
health  assessments.  Other  than  academia,  the  private  sector  cannot,  and  will  not
do  this  work  to  protect  public  health.  If  the  private  sector  conducts  research  at  all,
they  will  do  it  to  protect  their  interests.  ATSDR  also  does  cutting  edge  research
(e.g.,  groundwater  contaminant  fate  and  transport  modeling  as  is  being  done  at
Camp  Lejeune;  B-cell  work  in  conjunction  with  the  CDC  National  Center  for  Envi-
ronmental  Health  lab;  polycythemia  vera  cluster  investigation  in  conjunction  with
academia  and  State  government;  and  the  Brick  Twp,  NJ  Autism  Cluster  investiga-
tion,  started  in  1998  by  ATSDR  in  conjunction  with  CDC’s  Developmental  Disabil-
ities  division,  which  provided  the  first,  clinical  estimate  of  autism  prevalence  in  a
U.S.  community  since  the  late  1980s  and  established  that  autism  was  sharply  in-
creasing.

The  key  problem  with  ATSDR  is  the  poor  quality  of  many  of  the  health  assess-
ments and health consults. This could be changed by requiring independent peer re-
view  and  by  encouraging  ATSDR  to  involve  the  community  at  the  planning  and

scoping  stage  of  the  health  assessment/consult  as  well  as  the  conduction  of  the
health assessment/consult.

ATSDR  has  helped  build  capacity  of  State  governments.  Funding  by  ATSDR  to
several  states  in  the  late  1980s  was  crucial  in  establishing  birth  defect  registries
in  these  states  as  well  as  crucial  to  the  use  of  these  registries  to  investigate  the
health  effects  of  environmental  exposures.  ATSDR  funded  the  Woburn  study  of
childhood  leukemia  that  was  conducted  by  the  MADPH.  ATSDR  funded,  provided
oversight, and conducted the water and air modeling for the Dover Twp/Toms River,
NJ childhood cancer study that was conducted by the NJDOH.

ATSDR  is  a  leader  in  epidemiological  research  on  the  health  effects  of  exposures
to toxic waste chemical contaminants in drinking water, having either conducted or
funded the major studies in this field (e.g., four NJ studies, Woburn, Camp Lejeune,
Tucson). ATSDR also funded studies in two states that first documented that expo-
sures to disinfection byproducts (e.g., Trihalomethanes) in drinking water was asso-
ciated with adverse birth outcomes (low birth weight and specific birth defects).
Q4. Are community complaints about the work of ATSDR new?
A4. Community concerns were the basis for enactment of CERCLA. Therefore, from
the  beginning  of  ATSDR,  communities  have  rightfully  looked  to  ‘‘their  agency’’  to
solve  health  concerns.  However,  such  concerns  have  often  strained  at  the  limits  of
environmental  science.  Working  more  closely  with  communities  will  help,  but  will
not solve all the communities concerns.
Q4a. Why does this seem to be a perennial problem?
A4a. Although ATSDR is second only to CDC’s STD/HIV in the involvement of com-
munities in its activities, this is not saying much because, other than STD/HIV, the
rest  of  CDC  has  a  poor  record  on  this  as  well!  It  is  a  problem  because  ATSDR  still
is not fully committed to involving communities at the ground floor of the planning
and  scoping  of  its  activities  and  the  conduction  of  its  activities.  There  are  some  ex-
ceptions, such as the CAPs that have been formed at a few sites.

ATSDR needs to create a mechanism for full community involvement at each site.
Community  involvement  should  be  from  the  moment  a  site  is  discovered  (or  where
a  hazardous  condition  becomes  know)  until  the  site  clean-up  is  complete.  This  may
require  a  community  action  group  or  it  may  be  handled  in  a  simpler  fashion.  But
some mechanism should be mandated, established, and employed.

The issue continues to arise because of a form of ‘‘ivory tower syndrome,’’ in which
the staff, most often in an assessment or consultation role, does not seek community
input  because,  ‘‘. . .  we  are  the  scientist,  what  do  they  know.’’  In  such  instances,
the  failure  to  include  the  community  not  only  generates  resistance  but  also  serves
to restrict the information flow from the community and to the community.
Q5. Do you believe ATSDR products accurately communicate agency findings?

a. What are some of the problems you have identified in their reports?
b. How can the Agency be more effective in communicating risks?

A5. Toxicological profiles and health assessments are often not reader-friendly. The
health assessments often answer questions that are not of interest to the community
and  fail  to  address  adequately  questions  that  are  of  interest.  There  is  too  much
‘‘boiler-plate’’  material  that  is  unnecessary.  Public  health  assessments  (PHAs)  need
to be tailored to the particular site and the concerns at that site. In addition, PHAs
are  uneven  in  their  quality.  As  for  risk  communication,  holding  large  ‘‘availability
sessions’’  and  public  meetings  is  not  usually  the  best  way  to  communicate  risks!
(See answer to #4 on the need for community participation mechanisms).

Profiles,  by  law,  must  present  the  most  up-to-date  toxicological  information.  Ac-
cording  to  some  scientific  journals,  they  are  the  most  often  cited  toxicological  re-
sources.  ATSDR  has  provided  a  public  health  statement  in  the  front  of  each  toxi-
cological profile that is intended to be understandable to the lay audience, e.g., com-
munity  groups.  More  recently,  the  profiles  have  added  material  that  is  intended  to
be  helpful  to  a  medical  readership.  However,  if  the  documents  are  not  meeting  the
specific  needs  of  an  audience,  perhaps  the  Agency  could  use  focus  or  other  similar
groups as a sounding board for improvement of the final products.

ATSDR should work closely with the concerned community members (e.g., the ac-
tivists), State and local health agencies and health providers to ensure better health
communications.  ATSDR  must  seek  to  make  sure  the  questions  of  concern  are  ad-
dressed,  to  establish  trust,  to  be  fully  transparent,  to  obtain  community  buy-in  to
the approach being undertaken, to make sure the community understands the limi-
tations  of  the  agreed-upon  approach,  and  to  establish  the  best  way  to  communicate
the information/risks.

PHAs  would  possess  far  greater  value  if  mid-level  to  lower-upper  level  manage-
ment  was  not  so  concerned  with  political  correctness  and  ‘‘softening’’  the  informa-
tion. Certain words, like ‘‘carcinogenic’’ cannot be used because the public might be-
come ‘‘alarmed.’’ Yet, the community is asking for the accurate information.
Q6. Are  you  aware  of  ATSDR’s  recent  efforts  to  improve  its  processes  and  manage-

ment?
a. Do you believe they will adequately address your concerns?
b. How would you improve the Agency’s processes and management (or even cul-

ture)?

A6. I  see  no  evidence  of  any  improvement.  The  initial  planning  for  the  so-called
‘‘conversation’’  developed  with  hardly  any  staff  input.  So  staff  feel  the  new  process
is designed protect (shield) our leadership from Congressional attacks.

Morale  is  at  an  all  time  low  throughout  CDC  as  well  as  ATSDR,  primarily  be-
cause  leadership  does  not  respect  staff  and  does  not  seek  staff  input  at  the  ground
floor of the planning stage of new initiatives or reorganization, etc. ATSDR and Na-
tional  Center  for  Environmental  Health  (NCEH)  staff  are  not  collaborating  as  they
should—a  failure  of  the  leadership.  There  is  too  much  concern  about  ‘‘turf’’  within
and  between  ATSDR  and  NCEH,  and  there  is  insufficient  commitment  to  commu-
nity involvement at ATSDR and NCEH.

Either  the  existing  leadership  needs  to  seriously  address  these  problems  or  they
need to be replaced with leadership that will address these problems. Likewise, Con-
gress should mandate a formal merger, or separation, of ATSDR and NCEH, so the
staff and the public will have an understanding of to whom they need to speak and
who is responsible for assigned functions.
Q7. What was your impression of ATSDR’s coordination with other federal agencies

like EPA?

A7. It  is  my  experience  that  ATSDR  often  does  try  hard  to  coordinate  and  work
with  other  agencies  but  gets  little  response  and  cooperation  from  these  agencies.
However, one could also assume that some of the failure of other agencies to be co-
operative is in part the self infliction of wounds. I have hear high level officials from
four  Regions  of  the  EPA  indicate  that  while  ATSDR  could  do  good  work,  they  took
so long to do so that others ways of dealing with problems without including ATSDR
had become the norm.
Q8. How  does  ATSDR’s  level  of  confidence  compare  to  other  federal  and  State  enti-

ties charged with protecting public health?

A8. I  am  not  sufficiently  versed  in  all  the  efforts  of  other  agencies,  but  in  general
both  federal  and  State  entities  have  been  hamstrung  by  lack  of  funding/staff  and
the  policies.  However,  I  have  never  seen  confidence  or  talent  as  a  problem  at
ATSDR.  Rather,  I  have  seen  restrictions  on  the  staff  by  management  to  ‘‘word
smith’’ documents (assessments and consultation) to avoid ‘‘alarmist’’ issues is more
the problem.
Q9. How does ATSDR compare with similar entities in other countries?
a. Do international public health agencies have similar problems?
b. What do you attribute this?

A9. I  have  no  knowledge  of  any  agency  in  any  other  country  that  is  similar  to
ATSDR.

Internationally, the Agency is respected, often by countries that have no such pub-
lic  health  entity.  Having  products  from  ATSDR,  like  toxicological  profiles,  serves  to
assist other countries.
Q10. ATSDR  does  not  do  large  scale  environmental  sampling,  and  relies  upon  the

EP and states to conduct this work.

a. Do you believe ATSDR should do this work?
b. How would you suggest we pay for the work?
c. Would this be worth limiting the number of other studies, assessments or con-

sultation the Agency initiated?

A10. Large  scale  sampling  probably  should  continue  to  be  performed  by  EPA  and
the  states,  although  it  would  be  helpful  to  involve  ATSDR  at  the  ground  floor  of
the planning, scoping and conduction of sampling at each site. ATSDR should work
more closely with other federal agencies/groups, e.g., the U.S.G.S., in order to gather
current environmental data.

345

Sampling  should  be  paid  for  by  the  polluters,  and  most  often  times  is  paid  via

the cost recovery efforts of EPA.

During the early days of ATSDR’s existence, there was a serious problem with the
number  of  health  assessments  that  the  Agency  was  required  to  perform  in  a  short
period  of  time.  This  is  no  longer  a  major  problem.  Instead,  the  major  problems  for
the  PHAs  and  consults  are  unevenness  and  lack  of  consistency  across  the  PHAs/
consults, failure to address the concerns of the community, and poor scientific qual-
ity.  Much  of  this  could  be  resolved  by  requiring  peer  review  of  PHAs  and  health
consults.

Additionally,  the  ATSDR  Board  of  Scientific  Counselors  should  monitor  the  qual-
ity  of  PHAs  and  set  up  a  task  force  (within  ATSDR  or  independent  of  ATSDR)  to
deliberate  and  develop  a  consensus  concerning  the  risks  of  specific,  controversial
hazardous  substances  (e.g.,  TCE,  PCE,  dioxin,  PCBs,  perchlorate,  and  emerging
threats) that would guide ATSDR’s health assessments Finally, full community par-
ticipation is vital to the success of ATSDR’s work.
Q11. Do  you  believe  ATSDR  attempts  to  include  revolutionary  methods  and  tech-

niques in their work?

a. If not, how would you propose they better integrate cutting edge science?
b. Is there any risk to getting too far ahead of a technology or method and com-

ing to conclusions that are ultimately proven unfounded?

c. How would you set up policies or procedures to appropriately manage and uti-

lize these innovations?

A11. ATSDR  is  at  the  forefront  in  historical  exposure  reconstruction  modeling  for
drinking  water.  In  its  effort  at  Camp  Lejeune  (working  with  expert  researchers  at
GA  Tech  and  expert  consultants),  it  is  breaking  new  ground  in  the  modeling  of  the
historical  groundwater  migration  of  contaminants  in  order  to  provide  the  epidemio-
logical  studies  at  the  base  with  monthly  estimates  of  contamination  levels  at  the
tap decades before testing of the tap water quality were performed (i.e., actual test-
ing  for  contamination  did  not  begin  until  1982  but  the  water  modeling  effort  was
able  to  provide  scientifically  sound  estimates  of  contaminant  levels  back  to  the  be-
ginning of the water plant’s operation in the early 1950s).

No  other  epidemiological  study  of  drinking  water  contamination  has  conducted
such an extensive, and cutting-edge, modeling effort. ATSDR also is in the forefront
of disease cluster investigation methods, e.g., its use of molecular testing to confirm
polycythemia  vera  cases  in  PA,  its  use  of  clinical  testing  to  confirm  autism  cases
at  Brick  Township,  and  its  use  of  water  modeling  and  air  modeling  at  Toms  River.
ATSDR’s  use  of  immune  function  tests  in  communities  in  proximity  to  several
toxic waste sites identified a pattern of blood cells in certain individuals that resem-
bled a pattern seen in chronic lymphocytic leukemia although these individuals did
not  have  leukemia.  This  was  the  first  time  this  phenomenon  was  observed.  In  col-
laboration  with  the  NCEH  lab,  ATSDR  conducted  the  first  of  its  kind  study  to  fol-
low-up  these  individuals  with  this  pattern  of  blood  cells  and  found  that  these  indi-
viduals  were  at  increased  risk  of  eventually  having  leukemia  and  that  this  pattern
of blood cells was associated with living in proximity to hazardous waste sites.

ATSDR  also  provided  funding  and  oversight  to  academic  researchers  who  con-
ducted  research  focusing  on  the  health  effects  of  exposures  to  PCBs  in  the  Great
Lakes region and at Anniston AL.

ATSDR  has  state-of-the-art  GIS  technology  and  an  expert  staff  on  GIS  mapping

and analysis methods.

ATSDR does attempt to include novel, innovative methods in its research. In addi-
tion,  the  protocols  of  all  ATSDR  epidemiological  studies  must  undergo  peer  review
and IRB review before the study is conducted. After the study is conducted, the re-
port  of  the  findings  (either  a  journal  article  draft  or  a  draft  report)  must  undergo
peer  review  as  well  as  agency  clearance.  Even  with  these  reviews,  it  is  possible  for
the quality of the study to be substandard scientifically. Therefore, the Board of Sci-
entific Counselors should set up a task force that monitors the quality of the epide-
miological  research  at  ATSDR.  These  review  mechanisms  should  ensure  that  the
findings and conclusions are not ‘‘unfounded.’’
Q12. How can ATSDR do a better job characterizing past experiences given the com-

plexity of the task?

a. Do you have any specific recommendations?

A12. Historical  exposure  reconstruction  is  the  best  way  to  do  this,  but  it  is  expen-
sive, time-consuming, and cannot be done at most sites because of lack of sufficient
data.  But  often  the  problem  is  that  the  public  health  assessment  (PHA)  is  not  fo-
cused enough on past exposures. Of course, it is understandable and appropriate for

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00353 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

346

a PHA to focus on present exposures if they are occurring. But a strong commitment
to  evaluate,  as  best  one  can,  past  exposures  is  needed  as  well.  Often,  this  is  one
of  the  major  concerns  a  community  has.  The  PHA  should  go  the  extra  mile  to  un-
cover any information that would help it to characterize past exposures.
Q13. What  role  should  ATSDR  play  in  exposure  routes  not  associated  with  haz-

ardous waste (such as food, consumer products, water and air)?

a. How should the Agency address these issues?
b. Would there be any overlap with other agencies?
c. What should the Agency do when these is duplication of effort?
d. Do you believe ATSDR’s current mission is appropriate?

A13. ATSDR’s  current  mission  is  appropriate.  If  there  are  gaps  (e.g.,  disinfection
byproducts  in  drinking  water,  other  exposures  not  related  to  toxic  waste  sub-
stances),  then  ATSDR  should  work  with  NCEH  to  make  sure  these  gaps  are  filled.
ATSDR  should  conduct  epidemiological  research  on  the  health  effects  of  exposures
to  disinfection  byproducts  and  other  non-microbial  contaminants  (CDC  focuses  on
microbial  contaminants)  in  drinking  water,  and  become  the  leader  in  this  research,
but the Agency has not moved strongly in this direction. ATSDR may require more
staff and resources, it does have the expertise for water and air modeling and it has
access to the NCEH lab.

Any  overlap  with  EPA  could  be  resolved  (e.g.,  by  collaboration!),  but  in  most  in-
stances  there  really  is  not  overlap  with  EPA  (or  any  other  agency)  in  the  research
effort. ATSDR really does fill an important gap in the research on the health effects
of environmental exposures.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Henry S. Cole, President, Henry S. Cole & Associates, Inc., Upper Marl-

boro, Maryland

This report is written in response to a series of questions by Congressman Broun
and  is  based  on  my  experience  with  ATSDR  and  a  number  of  affected  to  commu-
nities  where  ATSDR  provided  health  assessments  or  consultations.  It  is  also  based
on  my  experience  in  dozens  of  communities  impacted  by  hazardous  waste  sites,
power plants, factory pollution, etc., where State regulatory agencies were involved.
I  have  not  answered  several  questions,  e.g.,  those  involving  past  exposure  meth-
odologies, and cutting edge technologies. Please use other sources of information for
these issues.

Questions submitted by Representative Paul C. Broun
Q1. Big  picture:  Does  ATSDR  contribute  to  the  health  of  environmentally  stressed

communities?

A1. In  working  with  environmentally  stressed  communities,  ATSDR  has  focused
largely  on  determining  whether  a  particular  source(s)  have  the  potential  to  expose
and  adversely  affect  the  health  of  residents.  This  function  is  clearly  embedded  in
the Agency’s mission statement:

ATSDR’s  mission  is  to  serve  the  public  by  using  the  best  science,  taking  respon-
sive  public  health  actions,  and  providing  trusted  health  information  to  prevent
harmful exposures and disease related exposures to toxic substances.

However,  this  statement  also  requires  ATSDR  to  take  ‘‘responsive  public  health
actions’’  and  to  provide  information  in  a  way  that  would  actually  prevent  harmful
exposures and improve community health. In my judgment, ATSDR’s efforts toward
these objectives are lacking.

The communities in greatest need of help are most often impacted by a multitude
of environmental stresses: e.g., a waste management facility, factory pollution, high-
ly  toxic  diesel  emissions,  and  unhealthful  levels  of  inhalable  particulates  and/or
ground  level  ozone.  Perhaps  there  are  sewerage  related  problems.  There  are  other
stresses  as  well—such  as  unemployment,  no  access  to  health  care,  aging  popu-
lations, lack of adequate housing, etc. Although there is clearly a need to study the
health  impacts  of  various  sources  and  chemicals,  studies  alone  will  not  bring  real
help to communities.

A holistic approach

Needs  vary  from  one  community  to  another;  i.e.,  the  local  health  clinic  may  need
expertise to deal with environmental exposures, perhaps a local credit union or pen-
sion  fund  could  invest  in  restoring  homes  to  livability,  or  perhaps  the  need  is  set
up  volunteers  to  visit  the  homes  of  elderly  neighbors  on  a  continuing  basis.  Such
efforts  will  require  a  different  vision  and  much  greater  coordination  between  pro-
grams  and  agencies.  However,  there  are  examples  of  community-based  approaches
which  attempt  to  solve  problems  holistically.  For  example,  in  Trenton,  a  non-profit
organization,  Isles,  Inc.  has  set  up  programs  to  remove  lead  from  home  environ-
ments  and  has  trained  residents  to  address  these  problems  and  to  restore  dilapi-
dated  buildings.  These  programs  have  led  to  employment  and  entrepreneurial  op-
portunities. Trenton has the potential to bring in up to $2.4 million for green collar
jobs  and  career  development  activities,  many  of  them  connected  to  restoration  and
improved environmental health. See http://www.isles.org/

This  program  is  by  no  means  unique.  In  fact,  President  Obama’s  economic  stim-
ulus  package  contains  funding  for  community-based  training  and  employment  in
areas  such  as  weatherization  and  renewable  energy.  (See  also,  The  Green  Collar
Economy by Van Jones and Ariane Conrad, 2008 for many examples of community-
based  initiatives  aimed  to  bring  environmental  health  and  economic  progress  to
communities.)

Multi-Agency Approach

Of  course,  no  one  agency  is  equipped  to  deliver  the  multi-faceted  assistance  that
many  environmentally  stressed  communities  need  for  improved  health.  Given  that
the  Administration  is  looking  for  ways  to  make  government  funding  work  more  ef-
fectively,  Congress  and  the  Administration  should  consider  creating  an  agency  in
the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  with  a  broader  mission  than
ATSDR. The new agency would focus on the problems and needs of environmentally

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00355 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

348

stressed  communities.  This  agency  would  work  closely  with  communities  and  local
governments to assess and meet the broad needs of public health. ATSDR would be
replaced  by  (or  ‘‘morphed’’  into)  a  branch  that  provides  scientific  assistance  to  the
new  agency.  The  new  agency  would  marshal  the  resources  of  a  broad  range  of  gov-
ernment  entities  including  EPA,  the  National  Institutes  of  Environmental  Health,
Housing and Urban Affairs, the Department of Agriculture, Commerce Department,
etc., to deliver the most needed targeted services (e.g., medical, nutritional, commu-
nity restoration, educational) etc. The Agency would also attempt to work with local
authorities and industries to seek creative solutions (e.g., a program to retrofit truck
fleets  with  particulate  filters  and  catalytic  converters  to  curb  highly  toxic  diesel
fumes).
Q2. The role of the private sector.
A2. A  number  of  Congressman  Broun’s  questions  focus  on  the  potential  role  of  the
private  sector  in  protecting  public  health.  I  have  separated  private  sector  into  sev-
eral components:

• Regarding  industries  (e.g.,  manufacturing,  energy,  agribusiness,  pharma-
ceuticals,  etc.)—in  general  they  have  failed  to  protect  public  health  (commu-
nities  and  workers)  without  strong  regulation  and  enforcement  by  govern-
ment.  A  good  example  is  mountain  top  mining  (MTM)—coal  companies  blast
the tops of mountains to get at coal and dump the overburden into the head-
waters  of  streams.  The  Bush  Administration  removed  regulatory  obstacles  to
MTM  despite  extensive  damage  to  ecosystems  and  communities  in  Appa-
lachia.
• Industrial research institutes that address environmental health, in my judg-
ment,  often  tilt  their  scientific  findings  to  protect  the  financial  interests  of
their  corporate  members.  For  example,  research  funded  by  the  chlorinated
plastic  industry  attempts  to  downplay  the  dangers  associated  with  the  life
cycle impacts of vinyl plastics. One exception is the insurance industry, espe-
cially  those  that  insure  health  and  environmental  damages.  Such  insurers
have  a  stake  in  preventing  illness  and  environmental  problems  such  as  toxic
spills  and  climate  change  (potential  for  increased  frequency  and  intensity  of
storms and related damage).
• Private  research  institutes  and  institutes  of  higher  education  have  brought
about an enormous increase in our understanding of the relationship between
toxic chemicals and health effects.
• The work of consulting firms often depends on the interests of the client. For
example,  consulting  firms  working  for  potentially  responsible  parties  at
Superfund  sites  may  conduct  field  studies  and  risk  assessments  that  under-
state the extent of the problem requiring remediation. As a result clients have
lower  cleanup  costs.  However,  this  is  not  to  say  that  all  consulting  firms  do
biased  research;  to  the  contrary  many  firms  have  produced  excellent  studies
for government, non-governmental organizations, etc.

Q3. The role of State agencies.
A3. In  my  experiences,  State  regulatory  agencies  and  State  departments  of  health
have  been  weak  in  their  protection  of  community  health.  In  some  cases  this  has  to
do  with  insufficient  resources.  For  example,  such  agencies  rely  on  the  regulated  in-
dustries  for  information  (e.g.,  stack  testing).  In  other  cases  there  is  an  extremely
close relationship between agency officials and corporate officials. In many cases, ec-
onomics, combined with political influence, trumps environmental health. For exam-
ple,  in  the  Ohio  EPA  has  permitted  an  energy  company  to  build  a  large  coke  oven
battery in Middletown, OH despite the impacts on the local airshed (already a non-
compliance zone with regard to ozone and PM2.5); this facility will be located about
0.7 miles upwind of an elementary school.
Q4. ATSDR’s Leadership Problem.
A4. ATSDR’s mission statement is as follows:

ATSDR’s  mission  is  to  serve  the  public  by  using  the  best  science,  taking  respon-
sive  public  health  actions,  and  providing  trusted  health  information  to  prevent
harmful exposures and disease related exposures to toxic substances.

The  Agency’s  conduct  with  regard  to  formaldehyde  exposure  in  FEMA  trailers
alone  requires  that  the  Agency’s  top  leadership  be  replaced.  There  were  at  least
three  serious  problems:  (1)  bad  science  (2)  failure  to  protect  the  health  of  families
living in the trailers and (3) communicating reassurance rather than accurate infor-
mation on risk to trailer occupants. The Oversight Subcommittee report (date) dem-

onstrates  that  the  behavior  of  top  ATSDR  officials,  including  its  Administrator,  not
only failed to carry out the Agency’s mission but destroyed its credibility beyond re-
pair.

In  addition,  the  Agency  under  current  leadership  lacks  both  the  vision  and  cre-
ativity that is needed to restore the health of environmentally stressed communities.
Q5. Community Complaints.
A5. As I have stated in my testimony, a large number of communities are frustrated
and angered by ATSDR’s work in their communities. For example, a national orga-
nization  with  a  large  grassroots  following  has  warned  in  its  publications  that  com-
munities may opt to boycott ATSDR (and cooperating State health departments) un-
less the Agency negotiates with the community in good faith regarding study proto-
cols and related issues of public concern.1

Witness  statements  at  the  March  12,  2009  hearing  provide  further  evidence  that
the problems at ATSDR are widespread. Secondly, two Congressmen testified at the
hearing  about  the  problems  with  the  Agency’s  investigations  of  the  naval  bombing
range  in  Vieques,  Puerto  Rico.  These  problems  described  include:  studies  that  are
shallow and predictably inconclusive from the start, flawed methodologies, over reli-
ance  on  company  or  federal  agency  data  (e.g.,  DOD,  DOE),  failure  to  use  all  avail-
able  sources  of  information,  failure  to  effectively  involve  communities  in  the  design
of  studies,  and  a  failure  to  obtain  peer  review,  especially  in  controversial  cases.  Fi-
nally, ATSDR’s response to uncertainty is too often to find an ‘‘inconclusive hazard’’
without recommendations for further study or preventive measures. Rather than err
on the side of precaution, ATSDR often issues ‘‘no evidence’’ findings that are quick-
ly  translated  by  sources  and  enforcement  agencies  to  mean  ‘‘no  problem.’’  While
there  are  dedicated  scientists  and  other  professionals  at  ATSDR,  the  prevailing
leadership  has  failed  to  take  advantage  of  a  large  store  of  expertise  and  desire  to
help communities. Moreover, the Agency has done little to provide actual relief from
or prevention of harm in environmentally stressed communities.

Risk communication:

The  quality  of  risk  communication  depends  upon  several  factors:  (1)  the  quality
of  information  used  as  inputs  to  the  assessments  (2)  the  inclusion  of  all  applicable
exposure  pathways  and  routes  (3)  the  confidence  that  community  members  have  in
those conducting the assessment and reporting the findings. One way to ensure that
all of these conditions are met is to involve the community and their technical advi-
sors from the outset. Programs that give community organizations access to environ-
mental  and  public  health  scientists  should  be  expanded.  Independent  peer  review
should be provided when concerned parties request on.

Trends: are the complaints new?

Current efforts: The complaints outlined above are certainly not new. The Agency
got  off  to  a  very  bad  start  by  conducting  a  large  number  of  congressionally-man-
dated  health  assessments  at  sites  on  the  Superfund  National  Priorities  List  (NPL).
These  were  cursory  reports  based  on  EPA  and  industry  data.  Residents  had  little
or  no  opportunity  to  provide  input  or  comments.  Residents  in  many  ‘‘Superfund
Communities’’ felt that the reports understated their impact and need for protection.
Spurred by widespread and growing criticism in the late 1980’s and early 90’s then
Administrator Dr. Barry Johnson sponsored a series of large meetings that included
grassroots  organizations  and  ATSDR  staff.  These  meetings  led  to  the  formation  of
an  ongoing  Community  and  Tribal  Committee  and  a  Community  Involvement
Branch  (CIB)  at  the  Agency.  CIB  has  formed  ongoing  community  advisory  panels
(CAPs)  to  obtain  input  and  promote  dialogue  between  officials  and  residents;  up-
front  and  continued  work  of  CAPs  have  helped  to  improve  the  responsiveness  of
ATSDR  to  community  concerns  and  the  Agency’s  trust  level.  In  addition,  Dr.  John-
son  directed  the  Agency  to  take  decisive  action  at  a  number  of  sites.  I  believe  that
these  efforts  paid  off  in  terms  of  what  ATSDR  was  able  to  deliver  and  its  trust
among  affected  communities.  In  my  judgment  the  Agency  has  lost  focus  following
Dr. Johnson’s retirement (1998). Dr. Henry Falk had good intentions but lacked the
strong leadership skills needed to guide an Agency with a difficult mission.

As  stated  above,  the  Agency  has  suffered  irreparable  harm  under  Dr.  Frumkin.
His recent efforts to establish a national dialogue are simply ‘‘too little and too late’’
to make the kind of changes that are needed.
Q6. ATSDR Products.

A6. One  critical  problem  with  risk  communication  in  ATSDR  products  is  that  the
Agency  fails  to  effectively  involve  communities  in  the  design  of  studies  and  in  the
wording of reports. In my written testimony (March 12, 2009), I stated that commu-
nity  members  should  (and  their  experts)  be  given  an  effective  opportunities  to  pro-
vide  input  on  protocols  for  all  investigations  and  on  drafts  of  all  reports  (including
health  consultations)  before  they  are  finalized.  Community  advisory  panels  that
work  with  ATSDR  over  extended  periods  have  been  effective  in  a  number  of  cases;
these help to build confidence in the final ATSDR product.

Moreover,  ATSDR  products  are  almost  never  peer  reviewed.  ATSDR  should  pro-
vide  a  peer  review  process  whenever  interested  parties  (e.g.,  community  members)
request  one.  Affected  communities  often  have  a  legitimate  need  for  concern  and
help;  community  members  are  likely  to  be  highly  suspicious  where  ATSDR  comes
up  with  ‘‘no-evidence  or  no-impact’’  finding—unless  they  have  been  involved  from
the outset in a meaningful way that develops a strong level of trust.
Q7. ATSDR coordination with other agencies.
A7. ATSDR works very closely with U.S. EPA’s Superfund Office. The coordination
takes  place  largely  at  the  regional  level,  with  ATSDR  regional  officials  often
headquartered in EPA regional offices. ATSDR also uses data generated by EPA or
by  parties  liable  for  cleanups  including  industries  in  the  private  sector  and  federal
facilities (especially Department of Defense and Department of Energy facilities). In
my judgment, ATSDR often allows these agencies to control the flow of information,
the  extent  of  testing,  and  even  the  outcome  of  studies.  Federal  agencies  including
EPA,  DOD,  and  DOE  must  often  address  issues  involving  cost.  For  example,  given
the absence of the Superfund feedstock tax, EPA has little money to fund cleanups;
thus  they  are  dependent  on  the  industries  liable  for  the  cleanup  to  conduct  the  re-
medial work. Negotiations do not always center on protection of health and environ-
ment,  but  on  the  costs  to  the  company  and  the  agreed  upon  cleanup  may  be  less
than  protective  of  health  and  the  environment.  ATSDR  officials  who  work  in  close
coordination  with  EPA  officials  may  in  some  cases  be  unwilling  to  ‘‘rock  the  boat.’’
I  would  recommend  that  agencies  conducting  health  studies  be  given  greater  re-
sources to obtain their own data and greater independence from EPA and potentially
liable  parties  including  federal  facilities.  Potentially  responsible  parties  (PRPs)
should reimburse health-based agencies for the costs of investigations.

ATSDR  also  has  cooperative  agreements  with  State  Departments  of  Health
(DOHs).  The  DOHs  often  conduct  public  health  assessments  under  cooperative
agreement  for  ATSDR.  The  DOHs  operate  under  similar  restraints  with  regard  to
obtaining information.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Howard Frumkin, Director, National Center for Environmental Health

and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (NCEH/ATSDR)

Questions submitted by Representative Paul C. Broun
Q1. Please  explain  the  difference  between  a  Health  Assessment,  a  Health  Consulta-

tion, an Exposure Investigation, and a Technical Assist.

A1. A  public health assessment is  defined  as  a  comprehensive  site  evaluation  of
data  and  information  on  the  release  of  hazardous  substances  into  the  environment
in  order  to  assess  any  past,  current,  or  future  impact  on  public  health,  develop
health  advisories  or  other  recommendations,  and  identify  studies  or  actions  needed
to evaluate and mitigate or prevent human health effects (42 Code of Federal Regu-
lations, Part 90, published in 55 Federal Register 5136, February 13, 1990).

A  public  health  consultation  is  a  response  to  a  specific  public  health  issue  or
question  which  requires  the  analysis  of  site-specific  data,  health  outcome  data  or
chemical-specific  data.  A  public  health  consultation  can  also  serve  as  a  written
record of a verbal response provided when immediate public health input is needed.
Often  site-specific  data  is  provided  to  ATSDR  as  it  becomes  available  and  in  order
to provide timely input on public health issues ATSDR will develop multiple public
health  consultations.  Public  health  consultations  are  therefore  more  limited  in  the
range  of  issues  addressed.  For  instance,  a  public  health  consultation  often  includes
the  review  and  analysis  of  information  on  a  single  pathway  of  exposure  whereas  a
public  health  assessment  includes  the  review  and  analysis  of  multiple  pathways  of
exposure.

Public  health  assessments  differ  from  public  health  consultations  in  that  they
may  consider  all  pathways  at  a  site,  and  are  released  for  public  comment  and  in-
clude a response to comments.

In  an  exposure  investigation,  ATSDR  collects  and  analyzes  site-specific  infor-
mation  and  biological  tests  (when  appropriate)  to  determine  whether  people  have
been  exposed  to  hazardous  substances.  Exposure  investigations  support  a  site  eval-
uation  by  conducting  targeted  sampling  to  evaluate  exposures  within  a  community.
ATSDR  documents  the  findings  and  analysis  of  its  exposure  investigations  in  the
public health consultation format.

A  technical  assist  is  a  response  to  external  requests  for  environmental  public
health  technical  and/or  educational  information.  Such  requests  may  be  received  via
phone  calls,  letters,  and/or  e-mails  from  external  requestors.  In  general,  the  tech-
nical assist will be used by the requestor to make a more informed decision. Unlike
other ATSDR documents, technical assists do not include a public health hazard cat-
egory.  If  a  data  or  information  package  is  submitted  for  evaluation  or  a  public
health  hazard  category  will  be  determined,  a  public  health  consultation  or  public
health  assessment  is  the  appropriate  format  to  document  the  analysis  and  decision
process.
Q1a. How does ATSDR determine which products to provide?
A1a. A  preliminary  assessment  is  made  of  the  exposure  pathways,  the  environ-
mental  media  data,  and  community  concerns  to  decide  what  product  or  products
would  provide  the  most  appropriate  and  timely  public  health  response.  In  most
cases ATSDR will coordinate with the person requesting our services to discuss the
request and the products and services that are most likely to meet their needs.
Q1b. Does ATSDR consult with the petitioner when it chooses which product to pro-

vide?

A1b. When  ATSDR  receives  a  petition,  a  team  of  environmental  scientists,  physi-
cians,  toxicologists,  and  other  staff  members  evaluates  all  site  information  and  de-
cides whether ATSDR will perform a Public Health Assessment or if some other ac-
tion—such as a Public Health Advisory, Health Consultation, or community environ-
mental health education—would better meet the community’s needs, or if no ATSDR
involvement  is  needed.  As  noted  above,  in  most  cases  ATSDR  coordinates  with  the
petitioner to discuss the request. Petitioners are informed in writing of ATSDR’s de-
cision  and  the  reasons  for  it.  Throughout  the  Public  Health  Assessment  process,
ATSDR is in regular communication with the petitioner and the community.
Q1c. Does the petitioner have any recourse to appeal ATSDR’s decision?
A1c. The  petitioner  may  request  a  change  in  the  type  of  ATSDR  product  at  any
time.  However,  as  a  practical  matter,  few  ever  do  as  the  ATSDR  proposed  product

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00359 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

352

is  tailored  to  produce  the  most  timely  and  relevant  public  health  response.  Public
health assessments are designed for more complex sites to address multiple human
exposure  pathways  and  many  contaminated  media  whereas  health  consultations
focus on a single human exposure pathway and media.
Q2. Approximately  what  percentage  of  work  done  by  ATSDR  is  self-initiated,  man-

dated by law, or the result of an outside petition?

A2. Very little of ATSDR’s work at sites is strictly self-initiated. Approximately 35–
45 percent of our current work results from citizen petitions and National Priorities
List (NPL)-mandated work. The majority of the remaining work comes from federal
and State agencies, primarily requests from EPA and State environmental agencies.
Q2a. How many petitions for assistance does ATSDR receive in a year?
A2a. ATSDR has received more than 750 petitions since the Agency first began ac-
cepting  them  in  1987.  The  average  number  of  petitions  each  year  is  approximately
35. (ATSDR received 34 petitions in 2008.)
Q2b. What percentage of petitions are you able to actually assist on?
A2b. While  all  petition  requests  are  carefully  reviewed,  approximately  60  percent
have  been  accepted  resulting  in  the  development  of  a  Public  Health  Assessment  or
Health Consultation.
Q2c. How do you prioritize such petitions?
A2c. Petition requests are prioritized using available data based on the likely sever-
ity  of  the  environmental  and  physical  hazards,  an  understanding  of  the  potential
pathways  of  exposure  and  the  affected  population,  the  availability  of  data  needed
to carry out an assessment, and evidence or suggestions of adverse health outcomes
in the community.
Q3. What options does ATSDR have if sampling data is limited for a particular re-

view?

A3. ATSDR  routinely  deals  with  incomplete  exposure  information.  ATSDR’s  ability
to draw public health conclusions is sometimes limited by the quantity and/or qual-
ity  of  the  exposure  information.  It  is  critical  that  the  exposure  information  used  to
evaluate  the  risk  for  adverse  health  effects  be  complete  and  accurate.  Often  situa-
tions  exist  in  which  either  no—or  insufficient—data  are  available  or  we  cannot  an-
swer the questions posed by the community due to limitations in science, even when
data  are  available.  However,  we  do  have  options  for  responding  to  situations  in
which there is limited sampling data, as we discuss below.

If exposure data are limited, we can

• search  for  and  retrieve  existing  data  (ATSDR  has  pioneered  methods,  and  is

very experienced at this task),

• measure  past  exposures  using  new  and  innovative  methods  (however,  even
when we can measure levels in the environment, it is difficult to know if peo-
ple have actually been exposed),

• model past exposures,
• use biomonitoring techniques (such as those developed by the National Center

for Environmental Health laboratory) when appropriate,

• report that there are limitations when we cannot quantify exposures and say

so, communicating well, or

• recommend that needed sampling be done by agencies such as EPA and State

agencies that are equipped to perform the sampling.

If health outcome data are limited, we can

• use  existing  health  outcome  databases  (although  the  United  States  does  not
systematically  collect  data  on  many  health  outcomes,  such  as  asthma,
neurodevelopmental disorders, or immune function disorders) or

• collect data by performing epidemiological studies (such studies are expensive

and time-consuming, and therefore only rarely feasible).

Q3a. Is caveating the limitations in the report your only option?
A3a. No. We have many options, as described above.

In addition, ATSDR works closely with CDC’s National Center for Environmental
Health  Environmental  Public  Health  Tracking  Program.  The  Tracking  Program

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00360 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

353

brings together data on environmental hazards, exposure to environmental hazards,
and health effects potentially related to exposure to environmental hazards.

As  a  final  note,  we  need  to  emphasize  that  caveats  are  important.  The  public

needs to know if data is missing and how that may limit what we can do.
Q3b. How challenging is this in terms of communicating results?
A3b. This creates frustration for some members of the public, who expect definitive
answers. For example, at Colonie, New York, we considered an epidemiologic study
of workers exposed to metals. We requested health data for the former workers but
were  not  able  to  obtain  the  data.  This  important  and  missing  piece  of  information,
combined  with  the  lack  of  environmental  data  for  the  years  of  peak  activity  at  the
plant,  left  a  research  gap  for  investigators  and  frustrated  members  of  the  commu-
nity.

However, we do have options for responding to situations in which there is limited

sampling data, as we discussed above.
Q3c. How do you propose ATSDR address this issue?
A3c. We  address  the  issue  of  not  having  enough  data  by  using  the  best  available
data, recommending how data gaps can be filled, and communicating the limitations
of that data to the communities we serve.

ATSDR is striving to expand the use of state-of-the-art exposure assessment strat-
egies,  and  also  to  combine  the  use  of  sampling  and  modeling  results.  For  example,
to accurately estimate park visitor exposures to asbestos at the Illinois Beach State
Park  site,  ATSDR  employed  activity-based-sampling  and  used  the  most  current
methods  for  asbestos  analysis,  developed  by  the  International  Organization  for
Standardization.

We  also  recognize  that  we  must  redouble  our  effort  to  be  clear  about  the  limita-
tions  of  the  data  and  to  work  with  communities  from  the  beginning  of  the  public
health  assessment  process,  and  throughout  the  process,  to  ensure  that—to  the  ex-
tent  possible—expectations  are  realistic.  ATSDR  has  launched  initiatives  so  that
concerned  citizens  better  understand  the  complex  nature  of  environmental  expo-
sures  and  will  be  able  to  make  informed  decisions  about  the  exposure  to  toxic  sub-
stances and their health.
Q4. In  the  case  of  formaldehyde  levels  in  FEMA  trailers,  EPA  conducted  sampling
after limited consultation with ATSDR. That sampling was deemed to be insuf-
ficient to characterize long-term exposure. How does the Agency now ensure that
it receives appropriate samples to adequately characterize exposure and risk?

A4. In  the  case  of  the  initial  work  with  the  FEMA  trailer  data,  ATSDR’s  role  was
as a technical assist that primarily involved reviewing EPA sampling data.

In  its  initial  review,  ATSDR  staff  did  not  consider  the  implications  of  chronic  ex-
posures.  That  has  been  corrected.  We  corrected  the  Health  Consultation  and  pub-
lished  a  revised  document  providing  background  information  on  exposure  to  form-
aldehyde  and  health  effects  (including  those  of  long-term  exposure),  and  clarifying
the limitations of the data analysis.

Following  the  initial  assessment,  and  recognizing  that  the  ATSDR  health  con-
sultation  was  not  designed  to  reflect  actual  conditions  of  those  living  in  trailers,
CDC’s  National  Center  for  Environmental  Health  undertook—and  is  continuing  to
conduct—extensive  activities  to  assess  health  risks  related  to  temporary  housing
units  used  after  Hurricane  Katrina.  These  activities  include:  a  structural  study  to
analyze  emissions  from  individual  components  of  trailers  and  mobiles  homes  used
as  temporary  housing,  and  a  study  of  occupied  housing  to  evaluate  levels  of  form-
aldehyde under actual living conditions. This effort led to recommendations regard-
ing  the  use  of  the  trailers  as  temporary  housing  and  resulted  in  FEMA  removing
people  from  units  with  unsafe  levels  of  formaldehyde.  NCEH  also  is  undertaking  a
comprehensive  long-term  study  of  children’s  health  related  to  Hurricane  Katrina.
Recognizing  that  this  is  a  broader  problem,  NCEH  and  ATSDR  convened  a  group
of  agencies  to  address  broadly  the  health  challenges  of  manufactured  structures.
The results of this effort are expected during the coming year.

ATSDR  routinely  confers  with  other  agencies  on  sampling  methodology.  Recent
examples  include  the  coal  fly  ash  spill  in  Tennessee  and  concerns  over  the  use  of
Chinese drywall in homes. ATSDR brings unique value by adding public health ex-
pertise to EPA’s sampling expertise, allowing the methods to consider the ways that
people are actually exposed.
Q5. How  can  ATSDR  do  a  better  job  characterizing  past  exposures  given  the  com-

plexity of the task? Do you have any specific recommendations?

A5. Reconstructing  past  exposures  is  a  core  challenge  in  the  environmental  health
field. ATSDR routinely deals with incomplete exposure information. ATSDR has sev-
eral options for investigating exposures and potential health effects.

We  can  search  for  and  retrieve  existing  data.  ATSDR  scientists  are  skilled  at  lo-

cating data sources and obtaining available data.

ATSDR is utilizing new ways to measure past exposures. Using innovative meth-
ods, ATSDR scientists are able to measure levels of environmental contaminants in
ways previously unavailable; however, even when we can measure levels in the en-
vironment, it is often difficult to know if people have actually been exposed.

ATSDR also has developed methods to model past exposures. The Agency uses ex-
posure-dose  reconstruction  as  an  approach  that  incorporates  computational  models
and  other  approximation  techniques  to  estimate  cumulative  amounts  of  hazardous
substances  internalized  by  individuals  presumed  to  be  or  who  are  actually  at  risk
from  contact  with  substances  associated  with  hazardous  waste  sites.  For  example,
ATSDR developed techniques for modeling complex water distribution systems to in-
vestigate  past  exposures  to  TCE  and  PCE  at  Camp  Lejeune  in  North  Carolina.
ATSDR’s water modeling activities support the Agency’s current epidemiologic study
of  childhood  birth  defects  and  cancer  possibly  related  to  past  exposure  to  contami-
nated drinking water at the base. We are also exploring the use of modeling in con-
junction with sampling data.

In  addition,  we  are  increasingly  using  biomonitoring  techniques  to  measure  the
level of contaminants that are actually in people’s bodies. However, this is only ap-
propriate  for  past  exposures  when  the  chemical  persists  in  the  body.  Some  are
quickly metabolized or expelled and, therefore, do not yield usable biomonitoring re-
sults.

Advancing  science  in  the  three  areas  discussed  above—1)  measuring  past  expo-
sures,  2)  modeling,  and  3)  biomonitoring—would  further  improve  the  characteriza-
tion of past exposures.
Q6. How does ATSDR decide when to partner with State health departments?
A6. ATSDR  works  closely  with  State  and  local  health  departments  whenever  pos-
sible. In more than half the states, this work is carried out through our cooperative
agreement  program  using  federal  funds.  Funding  is  based  on  a  competitive  process
to  ensure  states  are  qualified  to  conduct  this  work.  In  all  the  states,  we  provide
technical assistance as requested by the states.
Q6a. Do  these  partnerships  end  up  providing  states  with  additional  resources  from

the Federal Government?

A6a. Yes. The cooperative agreement program allows states to build capacity in en-
vironmental  health.  Even  though  resources  are  limited,  in  many  cases  the  only  ca-
pacity  within  the  state  to  deal  with  health  impacts  of  hazardous  waste  sites  comes
from money ATSDR provides.
Q6b. Is this an appropriate function of the Federal Government, or should states be

funding work with their own resources?

A6b. There  is  a  role  for  both  the  Federal  Government  and  the  State  governments
in environmental health. How these roles are balanced is a policy decision.

The  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,  Compensation  and  Liability  Act
(CERCLA),  as  amended  by  the  Superfund  Amendments  and  Reauthorization  Act
(SARA),  provides  that  ‘‘The  activities  of  the  Administrator  of  ATSDR  described  in
this subsection and section 9611 (c)(4) of this title shall be carried out by the Admin-
istrator of ATSDR, either directly or through cooperative agreements with States (or
political subdivisions thereof) which the Administrator of ATSDR determines are ca-
pable  of  carrying  out  such  activities.  Such  activities  shall  include  provision  of  con-
sultations on health information, the conduct of health assessments, including those
required under section 3019(b) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6939a (b)],
health studies, registries, and health surveillance.’’ See 42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(15).
Q6c. How does ATSDR ensure that conflicts of interest do not arise, or that ATSDR’s

work is simply seen as a ‘‘rubber stamp?’’

A6c. In  general,  conflicts  do  not  arise  in  our  work  activities  with  State  health  de-
partments. Our goal is mutual—we want to provide the best public health informa-
tion for the communities potentially impacted by a toxic exposure. ATSDR interacts
with State Health Departments on a routine basis, in the context of technical assist-
ance;  and  ATSDR  has  a  more  formalized  process,  the  State  Cooperative  Agreement
Program. There is an inherent sensitivity in working collaboratively with our State
Partners. The states are closer to their community concerns. On the other hand, fed-
eral  agencies  can  provide  additional  resources  or  certain  types  of  specialized  exper-

tise. ATSDR prides itself on strong working relationships with State Health Depart-
ments.  In  rare  cases-say,  when  the  state  owns  the  site  of  concern—there  may  be
an  appearance  of  or  the  potential  for  a  conflict  of  interest,  however,  ATSDR  mini-
mizes any potential impact and ensures that these sites are addressed with the best
public  health  approach  available.  In  all  cases,  ATSDR  insists  that  good  science  be
used in all products produced by the state with our support. Protecting public health
is our first priority.

ATSDR  routinely  receives  requests  from  State  Health  Departments  for  technical
assistance. For example, when a coal burning power plant had an accidental release
of  fly  ash  in  a  Tennessee  community,  the  Tennessee  Health  Department  imme-
diately  requested  ATSDR  technical  assistance  in  responding  to  community  health
concerns.  In  providing  technical  assistance  ATSDR  provides  independent  review
based  on  its  expertise  and  experience,  and  does  not  simply  ‘‘rubber-stamp’’  conclu-
sions or products. In this circumstance, the Tennessee Health Department prepared
a  fact  sheet  to  distribute  to  the  local  community  members  to  provide  information
on  their  health  and  this  fly  ash  release.  ATSDR  reviewed  the  fact  sheet  and  noted
that the statement related to health concerns was too reassuring to the community,
since  it  did  not  consider  the  longer-term  exposure  to  the  fly  ash  in  the  sediment.
The Tennessee Health Department agreed with ATSDR to change the fact sheet lan-
guage.  The  revised  fact  sheet  in  now  on  their  web  site  and  being  used  for  all  addi-
tional public health meetings.
Q7. How has the Agency evolved in terms of the services it provides?
A7. Initially,  most  of  ATSDR’s  work  was  mandated  at  Superfund  sites,  listed  on
EPA’s  National  Priorities  List.  Over  the  years,  the  amount  of  that  work  has  de-
clined, as fewer Superfund sites have been proposed. Technical requests from other
agencies and from State and local health departments have emerged as an increas-
ing  force  for  ATSDR’s  environmental  health  response  work.  The  role  of  ATSDR  is
an important one and despite the modest resources (approximately $74 million), we
make positive contributions to health and safety in many communities.
Q7a. Has  the  number  of  health  assessment  and  consultation  petitions  increased  re-

cently?

A7a. Petitions  have  remained  relatively  stable  through  the  years,  averaging  ap-
proximately 35 per year. From 1987–2007, ATSDR received more than 750 petitions.
Approximately  60  percent  of  these  were  accepted  and  addressed  by  ATSDR  and  its
cooperative agreement partners.
Q7b. Has the Agency begun to investigate additional pathways of exposure?
A7b. Although  Love  Canal  and  other  hazardous  waste  sites  were  the  focus  when
CERCLA was enacted and ATSDR created, ATSDR authority under CERCLA is not
limited to hazardous waste sites—it extends to hazardous substance ‘‘releases.’’ This
can include multiple ways people are exposed to chemicals. Examples of the breadth
of  ATSDR’s  work  include  our  emergency  response  program  and  our  work  with  air
releases from power plants and industrial facilities, such as those at the Mirant and
Rubbertown sites.

Enormous  progress  has  been  made  in  addressing  threats  from  hazardous  waste
sites.  In  addition,  emerging  science  has  provided  greater  insights  into  how  people
are exposed to chemicals and what chemicals are in people’s bodies. It is clear that
many human exposures to chemicals are not from waste sites. As a result, we recog-
nize the importance of investigating sources and pathways of exposure beyond haz-
ardous waste sites.

In  evaluating  the  health  impacts  of  chemical  exposures  from  a  broader  range  of
sources,  we  are  cognizant  of  the  possibility  of  duplication  of  effort  with  other  agen-
cies.  This  is  part  of  the  motivation  for  our  National  Conversation  on  Public  Health
and  Chemical  Exposures.  Over  a  year  into  planning,  this  process  involves  a  broad
cross-section  of  stakeholders,  including  environmental  groups,  communities,  profes-
sional groups, public health groups, industry, and other agencies, to assess our work
to date, in the broader context of cross-government efforts to address chemical haz-
ards and to make recommendations for involvement. These may involve substantial
changes in how ATSDR does its work. This effort will identify gaps in, and emerging
priorities  for,  the  public  health  approach  to  chemical  exposures  and  identify  solu-
tions that strengthen public health.
Q7c. How has this impacted the Agency?
A7c. ATSDR has done limited work with exposures to hazardous substances not re-
lated  to  hazardous  waste  sites,  such  as  naturally-occurring  asbestos,  air  emissions
from  power  plants  and  industrial  facilities,  and  uranium  in  water.  The  National

356

Conversation  on  Public  Health  and  Chemical  exposures  will  help  inform  develop-
ment  of  approaches  to  addressing  potential  health  impacts  of  other  sources  and
pathways of exposure.
Q7d. How  has  the  Agency  adapted  its  communications  strategy  to  meet  these

changes?

A7d. We  have  and  will  continue  to  communicate  effectively  with  the  communities
we serve. Through openness, cultural competency, and careful needs assessment, we
actively  engage  communities  through  our  site  work.  Our  Community  Involvement
Branch  includes  communication  specialists,  health  educators,  and  other  profes-
sionals with extensive experience in this area. These professionals, like others at the
Agency,  stay  abreast  of  developments  in  the  field  and  incorporate  them  into  our
work.
Q8. The  ability  to  determine  causation  is  complex  and  analysis  of  health  risk  levels

vary based on numerous factors.

A8. Communities  often  expect  that  an  agency  such  as  ATSDR  will  arrive  on  the
scene,  rapidly  assess  the  situation,  and  reach  unequivocal  conclusions.  Unfortu-
nately, it is not always possible to reach such conclusions. Definitive answers some-
times do not exist, due to the inherent uncertainties of science. Available data—both
environmental and health outcome data—are often limited. Small area epidemiology
lacks  the  statistical  power  to  draw  definitive  conclusions.  Finally,  the  public  health
field often lacks the appropriate tools to allow us to establish causation.

Despite  limitations,  ATSDR  has  identified  a  public  health  hazard  in  approxi-
mately 30 percent of cases. In approximately 40 percent of cases, available data sug-
gest  little  or  no  risk,  and,  in  approximately  30  percent  of  cases,  available  data  do
not  permit  a  conclusion.  In  addition,  our  documents  include  specific  recommenda-
tions  and  follow-up  actions  to  be  taken  by  agencies  with  appropriate  jurisdiction.
More than 70 percent of these are implemented.

It  is  possible  to  draw  certain  negative  conclusions  with  confidence.  For  example,
with  sufficient  information  we  may  positively  conclude  that  contamination  from  an
identified  source  is  not  reaching  a  community.  However,  positive  conclusions  are
harder to reach. For example, even when we identify a complete pathway and docu-
ment exposure, we cannot always establish a causal link between the exposure and
disease in the community. In many cases, it is impossible to draw firm conclusions.
Q8a. How  does  the  Agency  communicate  the  limitation  of  their  products  and  find-

ings?

A8a. ATSDR communicates these limits both in person and in writing. For example,
Community  Involvement  and  Health  Education  Specialists,  through  public  meet-
ings, public availability/poster sessions and other community meeting formats, com-
municate  with  stakeholders  throughout  the  process.  Through  early  and  ongoing
communication,  ATSDR  provides  information  on  public  health  implications,  risk,
and  limitations  of  our  work  in  qualitative  terms.  The  information  includes  how  we
will be:

tations and data gaps),

• reviewing  environmental  data  (to  include  environmental  or  health  data  limi-
• gathering community concerns,
• identifying ways people might come in contact with chemicals,
• determining if people are being exposed,
• determining how that exposure might affect public health,
• providing conclusions and recommendations,
• preparing a public health action plan, and
• communicating community involvement activities.

In  summary,  we  want  communities  to  know  what  to  expect,  including  the  dif-
ficulty in coming up with a causal link between exposure and disease. For example,
we communicate ‘‘risks’’ instead of ‘‘cause.’’

In  addition,  ATSDR  has  recently  revised  its  public  health  hazard  conclusion  cat-
egories  to  more  clearly  describe,  using  plain  language,  the  potential  risks  from  eat-
ing,  touching  and  breathing  unsafe  chemicals.  Our  revised  hazard  conclusion  cat-
egories  will  be  placed  at  the  front  our  documents  so  that  the  community  is  imme-
diately aware of our public health messages and other issues about the site.
Q8b. To  what  extent  do  you  attribute  criticism  of  agency  products  to  poor  commu-

nication?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00364 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

357

A8b. We attempt to minimize the potential for poor communication. Communicating
information  is  fundamental  to  ATSDR’s  Public  Health  Assessment  process,  and  we
work  very  hard  at  it.  ATSDR  has  extensive  experience  and  great  expertise  in  com-
municating with the public. However, we recognize that there are always opportuni-
ties to do better.

Sometimes,  however,  community  members,  who  are  justifiably  concerned  about
exposures  to  hazardous  substances,  may  reject  the  concept  of  ‘‘levels  of  risk’’  when
what  they  want  is  zero  exposure.  Despite  our  early  and  active  engagement  with
communities and our scientific attempts to address their concerns, there will always
be expectations which we cannot meet. In the case of Illinois Beach State Park, sev-
eral  individuals  remain  convinced  that  dangerous  exposures  are  occurring,  despite
four  rounds  of  extensive  air  sampling  over  the  last  decade  using  highly  reliable
methods  that  reached  the  opposite  conclusion.  In  stressful  situations,  research
shows  that  many  people  have  difficulty  processing  information  and  give  greater
weight  to  negative  information.  By  pulling  from  this  research,  we  can  better  guide
our communication efforts.
Q8c. Do you have any suggestions on how to better communicate the limitations?
A8c. As I said in my testimony, even excellent people and organizations can always
improve.  ATSDR  is  continuing  to  take  steps  to  improve  our  ability  to  communicate
complex scientific information to communities, including:

• Continue  fine-tuning  our  community  involvement  process;  focusing  our  site
teams on the skills needed to effectively interact with communities, including
preparing and presenting information to stakeholders, and including them in
the decision-making processes.
• Continue  initiating  contact  before  the  health  assessment  process  begins  and
listen  to  community  concerns,  obtain  critical  information,  and  assess  needs,
and  increasing  our  on-site  community-level  environmental  health  literacy
education efforts.
• Continue  incorporating  community  outreach  activities  as  a  standard  compo-
nent  of  the  ATSDR  Public  Health  Assessment  and  Health  Studies  activities.
• Continue developing and incorporating community health education activities
• Implement  the  new  language  and  format  of  our  public  health  hazard  conclu-
sion  categories  so  that  our  health  messages  are  clearer  and  easier  to  under-
stand.
• Continue  to  use  PHCs,  LPHCs,  and  TAs  to  respond  to  stakeholder  environ-

along with our community outreach activities.

mental health concerns in a timely manner.

Our goal is to include the community in the public health activities at the begin-
ning  and  during  the  health  assessment  to  ensure  they  are  provided  current,  ongo-
ing,  and  relevant  information  throughout  the  process  and  have  the  opportunity  to
provide input.
Q9. Do you believe ATSDR attempts to include revolutionary scientific methods and

techniques in their work?

A9. ATSDR  pays  close  attention  to  emerging  scientific  methods,  and  uses  them
when  appropriate.  We  recognize  the  need  to  balance  the  use  of  new  methods  with
the  use  of  validated  and  widely  accepted  techniques.  For  example,  when  we  inves-
tigated  polycythemia  vera  (PV)  in  Pennsylvania,  as  public  health  scientists,  we
knew that most cluster investigations do not identify environmental causes, and are
cautious  and  deliberate  about  such  investigations.  ATSDR  focused  initially  on
verifying and quantifying the excess cases of disease, sought outside hematologic ex-
pertise, and remained open minded about a possible environmental etiology. The he-
matology  expert  had  identified  a  genetic  mutation  called  JAK2  found  to  occur  in
most  PV  patients.  This  revolutionary  discovery  has  now  led  scientists  to  search  for
the  cause  of  the  JAK2  mutation  in  hopes  that  this  knowledge  will  help  them  find
the  cause  of  PV.  Using  this  genetic  marker,  ATSDR  scientists  confirmed  38  cases
of  PV.  ATSDR  will  further  evaluate  the  spatial  distribution  of  cases  and  review
available environmental data. ATSDR plans to conduct further scientific research to
determine the cause of the PV.

Ultimately, the decision of when to use new methods is a scientific judgment and
a  decision  best  made  in  consultation  with  a  broad  range  of  scientific  experts.
Through expert panels and peer review, ATSDR engages independent scientists and
scientists from other agencies and institutions in its decision-making process.

When  ATSDR  develops  new  methods,  we  report  those  methods  through  peer-re-

viewed, scientific journals.

358

Q9a. How can the Agency better integrate cutting-edge science?
A9a. The  methods  ATSDR  uses  to  integrate  new  technologies  with  existing  science
work  very  well.  For  example,  we  have  re-trained  scientists  to  apply  new  methods.
We have a dedicated GIS unit and a dose reconstruction lab. ATSDR scientists have
developed  innovative  techniques  of  computational  toxicology  to  help  rapidly  assess
hazards of chemical releases. ATSDR also provides training to State and local part-
ners  to  assist  them  in  incorporating  new  methods  into  their  health  assessment
work.

In  addition,  ATSDR  scientists  continuously  monitor  scientific  literature  and  at-
tend  professional  meetings  to  increase  their  awareness  of  new  techniques  and  how
to apply them to their work at sites. We use peer review to ensure that these meth-
ods are the best available for assessing exposures and protecting public health.

ATSDR’s  external  Board  of  Scientific  Counselors  evaluated  our  site  assessment
and  our  peer  review  procedures.  While  providing  us  with  a  number  of  constructive
recommendations,  their  report  highlights  the  soundness  of  our  approach  in  incor-
porating both public and expert scientific input.

ATSDR also works closely with NIH and other science-based agencies and organi-
zations  to  keep  abreast  of  new  and  innovative  technologies,  methods,  and  tech-
niques.
Q9b. Is there any risk to getting too far ahead of a technology or method and coming

to conclusions that are ultimately proven to be unfounded?

A9b. There  is  a  risk  to  getting  too  far  ahead  of  a  technology  or  method.  However,
we do not shy away from using cutting-edge science. Before cutting-edge techniques
or  methods  are  applied  to  a  public  health  problem,  those  approaches  are  peer-re-
viewed  as  are  the  developed  products  (be  they  Public  Health  Assessments,  health
studies, toxicological profiles, etc.). Our primary objective is to protect public health
and we maintain that objective throughout the health assessment process.
Q9c. How would you set up policies or procedures to appropriately manage and uti-

lize these innovations?

A9c. The decision to use new methods requires scientific judgment. These decisions
are best made in consultation with scientific experts, both internally and externally.
Through the use of expert panels and peer reviews, ATSDR calls upon the expertise
of  independent  scientists  and  scientists  from  other  agencies  to  inform  our  decision-
making process.

When  ATSDR  develops  new  methods,  we  report  those  methods  through  peer-re-

viewed, scientific journals.

We  clearly  identify  limitations  in  methods,  data  analyses,  and  conclusions  in  our
products,  as  is  standard  in  scientific  documents.  We  have  peer  review  policies  and
procedures  in  place  to  triage  documents  when  new  or  controversial  science  is  ap-
plied. Additionally, our Board of Scientific Counselors has reviewed clearance proce-
dures and receives programmatic reviews and updates and provides guidance on our
scientific approaches and programs.
Q10. How does ATSDR compare with similar entities in other countries?
A10. Most  countries  do  not  have  any  agency  similar  to  ATSDR,  nor  do  they  have
programs as comprehensive as those administered by the Environmental Protection
Agency  (EPA)  to  regulate  and  remediate  chemical  releases.  Each  year  ATSDR  re-
ceives  requests  from  the  governments  of  other  countries  to  send  their  scientists,
physicians,  epidemiologists,  and  engineers  to  Atlanta  for  special  training  on  con-
ducting  public  health  assessments.  For  example,  the  French  government  does  not
have  an  agency  comparable  to  ATSDR;,  they  have  sought  ATSDR  staff  to  teach  in
French  public  health  agencies,  and  have  sent  public  health  scientists  to  train  with
ATSDR. In addition, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has translated
our public health assessment manual into Spanish for use by public health officials
in Latin America.
Q10a. Do international public health agencies have similar problems?
A10a. The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  has  limited  capabilities  in  the  core
areas  of  ATSDR’s  work.  Addressing  health  issues  related  to  environmental  expo-
sures to hazardous substances often is left to the independent countries to address.
The  Basel  Convention  addressed  the  trans-boundary  shipment  of  hazardous  waste,
but did not include any health-related discussion.

ATSDR  is  seen  as  the  world  leader  in  addressing  public  health  concerns  related

to exposures to hazardous waste.
Q10b. What do you attribute this to?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00366 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

359

A10b. Even  though  hazardous  wastes  have  been  a  concern  for  many  years,  the  in-
vestment of resources to address public health issues resulting from these exposures
has  been  limited.  More  investment  must  be  made  to  improve  the  science  and  the
methods  that  public  health  officials  use  to  evaluate  exposures  and  to  educate  and
assist communities with environmental health concerns.
Q11. ATSDR  does  not  do  large  scale  environmental  sampling,  and  relies  upon  the

EPA and states to conduct this work.

Q11a. Do you believe ATSDR should also be doing this work?
A11a. Many  times,  environmental  data  already  exist,  based  on  regulatory  require-
ments.  However,  to  answer  important  exposure  questions,  ATSDR  scientists  often
need  data  that  do  not  exist.  These  are  needed  to  fill  gaps  between  existing  sets  of
data or to provide site-specific information related to exposures and health.

In  limited  cases,  ATSDR  does  conduct  environmental  or  biological  sampling,  al-
though  these  efforts  can  be  tremendously  expensive  and  time-consuming.  ATSDR
can only conduct a few large-scale sampling projects each year. This leaves ATSDR
with  the  difficult  trade-off  between  conducting  more  extensive  sampling  at  fewer
sites, and responding to concerns at a greater number of sites.

To make the best use of limited resources, ATSDR generally works in partnership
with  other  agencies  when  large  scale  environmental  sampling  is  needed.  These
agencies  often  have  the  regulatory  authority  to  conduct  environmental  monitoring
and  sampling,  as  well  as  the  technical  expertise  and  resources.  As  noted  earlier,
ATSDR often is called on to provide technical assistance in development of sampling
plans  to  ensure  sampling  is  conducted  in  a  way  that  maximizes  the  usefulness  of
data for assessing exposures. And, ATSDR often assists in evaluating data, applying
its expertise in the health effects of potential exposures.

There  are  also  creative  solutions  to  this  dilemma.  For  example,  environmental
sampling  is  useful,  but,  in  some  cases,  it  can  be  replaced  by  biomonitoring.  In  the
case  of  1,4  Dioxane,  ATSDR  used  existing  NCEH  biomonitoring  data  to  determine
that there were no detectable levels in the people sampled. This was an economical
solution that allowed us to use our resources to respond to other exposures.
Q11b. How would you suggest we pay for this work?
A11b. ATSDR  does  not  have  the  resources  to  conduct  large-scale  research—either
to develop environmental or biological sampling data to assess exposures or to inves-
tigate  the  toxicological  properties  of  a  hazardous  substance.  The  Agency  identifies
data  needs,  seeks  out  existing  data  to  fill  those  needs,  and  works  in  partnership
with other agencies, at the federal, State, and local levels, as well as with academic
institutions and private entities, to develop data to meet needs where sufficient data
do not currently exist.
Q11c. Would this be worth limiting the number of other studies, assessments, or con-

sultations the Agency initiated?

A11c. Limiting the number of sites in order to free up resources to conduct original
sampling  would  diminish  ATSDR’s  capacity  for  responding  to  community  concerns
and  frustrate  communities  seeking  answers  to  important  health  concerns.  Already
ATSDR  does  only  a  small  number  of  health  studies,  which  are  far  more  resource
intensive than other approaches.

Sites  under  consideration  for  Public  Health  Assessments,  Health  Consultations,
Exposure  Investigations  and  Technical  Assists  come  to  ATSDR  through  the  Super-
fund  process,  from  direct  requests  from  other  federal  agencies  (EPA,  DOE,  DOD,
etc.),  and  from  requests  from  concerned  community  members.  ATSDR  reviews  each
site and prioritizes according to need and available resources; however, we strongly
believe that it is important to remain responsive to communities, to work with them
to address health concerns, and to engage at sites as needed.
Q12. What  role  should  ATSDR  play  in  exposure  routes  not  associated  with  haz-

ardous wastes (such as food, consumer products, water, and air)?

a. How does the Agency intend to address these issues?
b. Is there any overlap with other agencies?
c. What does the Agency do when there is duplication of effort?

A12. ATSDR helps protect the public from exposures to hazardous substances from
releases  at  hazardous  waste  sites  and  at  a  variety  of  other  settings.  These  releases
may  range  from  chemical  plant  explosions  to  a  spill  of  coal  combustion  products.
They  can  be  those  identified  by  government  agencies  or  by  individuals  within  the
community through the petition process.

A series of environmental laws in the 1970s and 1980s defined the U.S. approach
to  chemical  exposure  risks.  A  mosaic  of  agencies  and  organizations,  governmental
and  nongovernmental,  regulatory  and  non-regulatory,  carry  out  various  public
health functions. As a result, some key responsibilities may not be carried out ade-
quately, and others may be redundant. ATSDR’s mission and functions must be con-
sidered within this broader context.

In  recognition  of  these  realities,  ATSDR  and  its  companion  Center  at  the  CDC,
the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), have initiated the National
Conversation on Public Health and Chemical Exposures. This process is designed to
identify gaps in, and emerging priorities for, the public health approach to chemical
exposures  and  identify  science-based  solutions  that  strengthen  public  health.  This
will  build  on  ATSDR’s  strong  working  relationships  with  a  broad  range  of  stake-
holders,  and  further  help  us  to  use  resources  responsibly,  avoid  redundancy,  and
eliminate gaps in public health coverage.

Public health functions related to chemical exposures include exposure and health
surveillance,  investigation  of  incidents  and  releases,  emergency  preparedness  and
response,  regulation,  research,  and  education.  When  our  efforts  overlap,  we  work
closely with other agencies by sharing data and expertise to recognize and mitigate
community  exposures  and  protect  public  health.  For  example,  ATSDR  responds  to
emergencies involving the release of chemicals, most often in collaboration with the
Environmental Protection Agency. ATSDR personnel provide real-time public health
guidance  following  acute  releases  of  hazardous  substances  and  health  information
to the public (for example, helping determine when people can safely reoccupy their
homes and businesses after an evacuation).

ATSDR also works with other partner agencies to provide advice and guidance on
topics  such  as  exposure  routes,  toxicology,  data  sampling,  data  collection,  epidemi-
ology,  and  data  analysis.  We  collaborate  with  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration
and U.S. Department of Agriculture on issues pertaining to food, with the Environ-
mental  Protection  Agency  and  U.S.  Geological  Survey  on  air  and  water  concerns,
and with the Consumer Product Safety Commission when product safety is in ques-
tion. We may evaluate data collected by these other agencies for health implications,
while  our  partner  agencies  may  examine  other  aspects,  such  as  environmental  or
regulatory implications.
Q13. How does ATSDR’s level of competence compare to other federal and State enti-

ties charged with protecting public health?

A13. ATSDR  is  a  non-regulatory  environmental  public  health  agency.  We  are  com-
munity-oriented,  working  to  respond  to  local  concerns.  We  operate  by  bridging  the
work  of  other  agencies,  and  between  federal  agencies  and  states.  We  are  a  special-
ized agency, and, in the areas in which we specialize, we are very good.

However,  we  are  a  small  agency,  lacking  the  depth  and  breadth  in  some  areas
that would enable us to more fully fulfill our mission. With only 300 employees, we
lack adequate capacity in certain important fields, such as veterinary epidemiology,
industrial  hygiene,  and  air  quality  modeling.  To  address  these  challenges,  we  work
closely  with  other  federal  and  State  agencies.  To  help  devise  a  long-term  solution,
we have initiated our National Conversation to identify gaps in, and emerging prior-
ities  for,  the  public  health  approach  to  chemical  exposures,  and  to  identify  science-
based solutions that strengthen public health.
Q13a. Would you characterize the work ATSDR does as a specialized niche?
A13a. Several  agencies  (including  NIH’s  National  Institute  of  Environmental
Health  Sciences  and  EPA,  in  addition  to  ATSDR)  share  responsibility  for  assessing
the  human  health  effects  from  exposure  to  environmental  contaminants.  ATSDR
does  have  a  specialized  niche  in  assessing  exposures  to  hazardous  waste.  CERCLA
specifically  established  ATSDR  for  this  purpose.  ATSDR  has  pioneered  the  public
availability  session  and  remains  an  authority  on  public  interaction  with  commu-
nities  potentially  impacted  by  hazardous  waste  sites.  ATSDR  is  a  world  leader  in
providing  toxicological  profiles  of  specific  toxic  substances.  ATSDR’s  toxicological
profiles  are  frequently  used  and  held  in  very  high  regard,  domestically  as  well  as
internationally.
Q13b. Do any other agencies perform this same work?
A13b. ATSDR’s  work  complements  that  of  NIEHS,  EPA,  the  National  Toxicology
Program  (NTP),  NIOSH,  OSHA,  FDA,  and  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission
(CPSC). These agencies, along with other agencies and organizations, governmental
and  non-governmental,  regulatory  and  nonregulatory,  carry  out  various  public
health  functions  related  to  chemical  exposures.  These  functions  include  exposure
and  health  surveillance,  investigation  of  incidents  and  releases,  emergency  pre-

paredness and response, research, and education. NCEH/ATSDR plays a significant
role in carrying out several of these key public health functions.
Q14. In  your  testimony,  you  describe  one  of  the  problems  ATSDR  faces  is  the  dif-
ficulty  ATSDR  sometimes  faces  when  a  community  refuses  to  believe  your  con-
clusions.  Specifically,  you  mention  that  ATSDR  and  counterpart  site  agencies
have had to repeat investigations several times at the same location which end
up  yielding  the  same  conclusions  as  the  original  investigation.  This  does  not
seem  like  the  most  efficient  use  of  resources.  What  can  be  done  to  ensure  that
communities  who  have  genuine  problems  have  access  to  the  resources  ATSDR
can provide?

A14. ATSDR  does,  from  time  to  time,  revisit  a  site.  In  some  instances  this  may  be
considered  inefficient,  but  we  consider  it  to  be  prudent,  as  our  work  is  a  mixture
of community service and the best science. If new data are available, new scientific
methods  emerge,  or  community  concerns  persist,  this  may  justify  returning  to  con-
duct additional work at a site.

For  example,  in  the  case  of  Illinois  Beach  State  Park,  continuing  questions  illus-
trated a need for additional information. New sampling techniques provided a great-
er level of confidence in the results. Even there, a small number of community mem-
bers  were  not  convinced.  However,  through  the  cooperation  with  other  federal  and
State  agencies,  we  provided  the  community  with  scientifically  rigorous  health  guid-
ance. On the other hand, after careful review of new research related to the Colonie,
New  York,  site,  since  the  hazard  has  long  ago  been  removed,  among  other  reasons,
ATSDR concluded that a community study would be unlikely to have scientific yield
or public health benefit.
Q15. In  your  written  statement,  you  mention  the  challenges  related  to  the  research
capacity  at  ATSDR.  Given  the  workload  and  the  statutory  authorities  given  to
ATSDR,  would  you  consider  research  to  be  a  primary  goal  for  this  organiza-
tion?  Would  it  not  make  more  sense  that  you  identify  gaps  in  scientific  knowl-
edge  through  your  public  health  assessments  and  leave  it  to  another,  more-
equipped agency or organization to undertake the research required to fill those
holes?

A15. ATSDR  is  charged  under  CERCLA  with  expanding  the  knowledge  base  about
health effects from exposure to hazardous substances.

Research  on  the  human  health  effects  of  environmental  exposure  to  hazardous
substances  is  conducted  by  a  number  of  federal  agencies,  including  the  NIEHS,
NCEH,  EPA,  and  ATSDR.  ATSDR  carries  out  its  research  responsibilities  through
a  number  of  mechanisms.  The  Agency  takes  steps  to  initiate  needed  research.  For
example,  ATSDR  identifies  important  data  gaps  and  takes  steps  to  fill  those  gaps,
such  as  through  petitions  to  the  National  Toxicology  Program  to  conduct  research
on  particular  exposures  (i.e.,  naturally  occurring  asbestos).  ATSDR  also  funds  a
longstanding  program  through  the  Association  of  Minority  Health  Professions
Schools  (AMHPS)  to  conduct  needed  research,  while  supporting  the  training  of  mi-
nority professionals in toxicology.

ATSDR  has  a  distinct  role  in  applied  public  health  research,  arising  from  the
Agency’s  site-specific  work.  Examples  of  ATSDR’s  work  in  applied  public  health  re-
search include the development of innovative modeling techniques at Camp Lejeune
in  North  Carolina, 
(toluene
diisocyanate) in North Carolina, research on a possible environmental component of
polycythemia  vera  in  Pennsylvania,  and  research  into  beryllium  disease  in  commu-
nity settings in Ohio.

investigation  of  community  exposures  to  TDI 

This  research  flows  from  our  field  work.  We  definitely  have  a  research  role,  but
we need to be strategic. In some cases, it is better for us to leave research to others;
in  other  cases,  it  is  important  that  ATSDR  do  the  research,  based  on  the  unique
expertise and experience of its workforce.

Questions submitted by Representative Steve Rothman
Q1. ATSDR  seems  to  say  to  the  people  of  Vieques  Island,  ‘‘Nevermind.  Nothing  to

worry about here.’’

A1. This  is  not  an  accurate  characterization  of  ATSDR’s  approach  to  the  people  of
Vieques. Over the last decade ATSDR’s work in Vieques has been extensive, careful,
and responsive. This work included:

• A  series  of  Public  Health  Assessments  (PHAs)  to  investigate  environmental
contamination on the island and possible pathways by which people might be
exposed to those contaminants.

rate environmental health information was available to the community.

• Training  and  materials  for  health  care  providers  and  educators  so  that  accu-
• Extensive  consultation  with  the  community,  before,  during,  and  after  its  in-
vestigations,  to  hear  public  concerns  and  to  incorporate  them  into  its  work.
ATSDR’s  work  on  the  island  included  four  PHAs,  each  investigating  a  different
potential  pathway  of  exposure  to  dangerous  chemicals:  groundwater  and  drinking
water  (2001),  soil  (2003),  fish  and  shellfish  (2003),  and  air  (2003).  In  addition,  we
convened two expert panels, one to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of hair test-
ing, and one to assess environmental risk factors for heart disease.

Throughout the course of our work in Vieques, we encouraged community partici-
pation,  provided  educational  material,  and  held  meetings  to  explain  both  our  find-
ings  and  the  methods  used  to  reach  our  conclusions.  We  solicited  public  comments
on  each  of  our  Public  Health  Assessments  and  addressed  those  comments  in  our
final documents. We met with members of the community, both individually and in
public forums, to discuss the findings. We worked through health care providers and
educators  on  the  island  to  make  educational  material  available  to  residents.  This
is  a  record  of  Agency  action  that  reflects  sincere  concern  for,  and  accountability  to,
the people we serve.

ATSDR continues to be dedicated to the health of the people of Vieques. We have
committed  to  re-engaging  in  Vieques,  to  assessing  new  or  persistent  health  con-
cerns, to analyzing any new data, and to reassessing our conclusions as appropriate.
Q1a. Why  is  it  that  independent  scientists  can  find  troubling  evidence  of  potential

public health issues that ATSDR is unable to find?

A1a. ATSDR  is  not  aware  of  any  published  peer-reviewed  scientific  studies  that
have  documented  human  exposure  to  hazardous  chemicals  on  Vieques  at  levels  of
health concern.

There  is  evidence  of  environmental  contamination  on  Vieques.  We  are  aware  of
some credible, though unpublished, measurements of chemicals in grass, in non-edi-
ble  plant  species  near  the  live  impact  area  (LIA)  at  the  eastern  end  of  the  island,
and  in  non-edible  animals,  as  well  as  studies  of  how  plants  may  take  up  metals.
These data suggest that some plants near the LIA and some non-edible marine spe-
cies  contain  contaminants—results  that  correspond  to  ATSDR’s  own  findings.  How-
ever, this contamination was some miles from where people live on the island. More-
over,  detailed  assessment  did  not  identify  specific  pathways—say,  eating,  drinking,
or breathing—by which people might absorb these contaminants. At the time of our
assessments, neither the food people were eating, nor the water they were drinking,
nor the air they were breathing, nor the soil they were touching, contained contami-
nants  at  levels  associated  with  health  problems.  Even  if  contaminants  are  present
in the environment, if they do not reach people’s bodies, then human health effects
are not expected.

The  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA),  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric
Administration  (NOAA)  and  others  continue  to  characterize  the  nature  and  extent
of  the  contamination  associated  with  past  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  activities
on  the  island.  Based  on  this  work,  we  are  currently  considering  whether  new  data
warrant  additional  activities  to  assess  potential  exposures  that  might  impact  the
health of the people of Vieques.
Q2. Are you aware of the scientific studies done on the island of Vieques questioning

the ATSDR’s public health assessments?

A2. Through  media  reports,  we  are  aware  of  several  studies  of  environmental  con-
tamination and health on Vieques. ATSDR has requested the environmental studies
for  review,  but  was  informed  that  they  had  not  been  published  and  were  unavail-
able. ATSDR also followed up on reports of a study of cancer mortality on Vieques;
however, this report has also not yet been published. ATSDR is assessing the qual-
ity  and  availability  of  cancer  registry  data  in  Puerto  Rico,  including  Vieques—pre-
viously  unsatisfactory  but  now  said  to  be  much  improved—to  determine  if  the  reg-
istry can be used to study cancer rates on Vieques.
Q3. Are  you  aware  of  the  hair  testing  of  the  people  of  Vieques  themselves,  provided
to the U.S. Navy, showing extremely high levels of mercury, lead, cadmium, ar-
senic and aluminum?

A3. ATSDR  is  aware  of  the  human  hair  analysis,  which  indicated  elevated  levels
of mercury (and antimony in one individual). Hair analysis is a controversial meth-
od  in  environmental  health,  and  one  that  can  be  subject  to  variability  and  inaccu-
racy. To assess the Vieques findings, ATSDR convened an independent expert panel
to evaluate the science of hair analysis. This is an example of ATSDR’s willingness

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00370 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

363

to  carefully  evaluate  whether  emerging  or  novel  scientific  methods  might  assist  in
our assessments. In this case the expert panel concluded that the hair analysis was
likely  to  be  unreliable.  ATSDR  offered  to  follow  up  with  a  broader,  biological  expo-
sure  investigation,  of  which  human  hair  analysis  would  be  a  part,  in  addition  to
other specimens; however, the community opted not to participate at that time.

ATSDR  was  also  made  aware  of  results  of  animal  hair  testing  from  the  Puerto
Rico  Department  of  Agriculture  in  cooperation  with  the  Farmers  Association  of
Puerto  Rico.  These  groups  concluded  that  agricultural  products  from  Vieques  were
suitable for consumption and did not contain toxic levels of these contaminants.
Q4. How  do  you  evaluate  the  public  health  exposures  of  dangerous  contaminants  at

specific sites?

A4. We assess whether chemicals released into the environment are reaching people
by  empirically  evaluating  the  specific  pathways  that  might  operate:  eating,  drink-
ing,  touching,  or  inhaling  the  chemicals.  If  there  is  a  ‘‘completed  pathway’’—evi-
dence that chemicals are reaching people—we then determine quantitatively wheth-
er the exposure levels are associated with adverse health effects, by turning to toxi-
cological, epidemiological, and medical studies in the literature.
Q4a. How do you know what to test for?
A4a. Two  main  sources  guided  our  sampling  efforts:  in-house  expertise  related  to
chemicals  present  in  explosive  residue;  and  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  data  re-
garding the composition of the bombs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
has an oversight role in working with DOD to determine adequate characterization
of  the  nature  and  extent  of  contaminants.  In  addition  to  reviewing  sampling  data
from  other  agencies,  ATSDR  sampled  for  bomb-related  metals  and  explosive  resi-
dues.
Q4b. Did  the  U.S.  Navy  provide  ATSDR  with  a  list  of  all  the  chemicals  used  at  its
Roosevelt  Roads  Naval  Station  on  Vieques  or  found  in  its  munitions  which
have leached chemicals onto the island and into the sea as a result of ordnance
exercises at the Vieques Naval Training Range for over 69 years?

A4b. Yes, the Navy provided ATSDR with a list of chemicals found in its munitions;
however,  we  cannot  know  with  certainty  whether  the  list  of  chemicals  provided  by
the Navy was complete.
Q4c. Did the U.S. Navy provide information to ATSDR about the amount of depleted
uranium,  or  napalm  or  Agent  Orange  or  dioxins  or  other  potentially  toxic
chemicals it used on Vieques?

A4c. The  Navy  provided  ATSDR  with  this  information.  The  information  the  Navy
provided indicated that:

uranium (DU) penetrator projectiles on the LIA in February 1999.

• Two  Marine  aircraft  fired  263  rounds  of  ammunition  armed  with  depleted
• The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) conducted an environmental sur-
• More  than  70  percent  of  the  DU  rounds  have  been  located  and  the  locations
• NRC reported that a recent survey found no additional depleted uranium.

vey on Vieques in June 2000.

have been marked.

Q4d. Wouldn’t  you  agree  that  the  party  who  is  in  the  best  position  to  know  exactly
what  toxics  and  chemicals  were  used  on  Vieques  is  the  U.S.  Navy?  If  so,  did
ATSDR  ever  demand  the  kind  of  relevant  information  I’ve  mentioned  here,  so
that the people of Vieques and those of us who are concerned about their health
might  know  what  they  have  really  been  facing  in  terms  of  harmful  exposure
to all these toxic chemicals?

A4d. The  Navy  has  extensive  information  on  environmental  contaminants  in
Vieques,  and  ATSDR  must  rely  on  the  Navy  data  in  its  assessments.  This  not  un-
usual;  we  often  have  to  rely  on  data  from  others.  In  the  case  of  Vieques,  ATSDR
asked  for  and  received  data  from  the  Navy.  ATSDR  has  also  received  information
from NRC on depleted uranium, from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and
NOAA on aquatic life, and from EPA on various environmental media.
Q5. Do  you  stand  by  your  agency’s  assessment  that  Vieques  is  a  perfectly  safe  envi-

ronment?

A5. No  ATSDR  document  says  that  the  environmental  is  perfectly  safe.  However,
each of our Public Health Assessments on specific pathways is based on solid anal-
ysis and we stand by these documents. According to the data we have reviewed, as

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:54 Dec 21, 2009 Jkt 047718 PO 00000 Frm 00371 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\DWORK\I&O09\031209\47718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

364

long  as  people  do  not  enter  restricted  areas,  including  the  LIA  and  nearby  waters,
they  are  safe  from  contaminant  exposure  and  from  the  physical  injury  risk  associ-
ated with unexploded ordnance.
Q6. Would you feel comfortable raising your family in a similar environment?
A6. The data we have reviewed have revealed nothing that would prevent me from
raising  my  family  on  Vieques.  However,  I  would  keep  my  family  out  of  the  re-
stricted, unremediated areas in the LIA.
Q7. What  do  you  think  ATSDR  could  have  done  differently  to  improve  the  public

health assessments performed on Vieques?

A7. Vieques  is  one  of  ATSDR’s  most  comprehensive  investigations.  It  included  four
Public Health Assessments, in addition to other work. The Vieques investigation in-
cluded assessments of the air pathway, soil pathway, water pathway, seafood path-
way,  hazards  associated  with  vibrations,  and  numerous  review  panels  to  evaluate
unpublished  data  collected  by  others.  ATSDR  provided  numerous  health  education,
physician  education,  and  school-based  environmental  health  education  resources
and training to help the community gain the knowledge to identify hazards, protect
themselves from the hazards, and notify authorities about the hazards.

EPA and other agencies are engaged in an environmental clean up and additional

sampling, and ATSDR remains available to review their data as necessary.

As discussed above, ATSDR’s focus was on assessing exposures rather than health
outcomes. Some may suggest that we should have done a health outcome study dur-
ing  our  work  on  Vieques.  Typically,  ATSDR  does  not  investigate  health  outcomes
unless  exposures  are  documented.  This  is  to  focus  ATSDR’s  limited  resources  in
communities where exposures are found.

ATSDR  was—and  is—interested  in  learning  more  about  health  statistics  on
Vieques,  especially  if  there  is  strong  local  support  for  such  an  inquiry.  At  the  time
of  our  work  on  Vieques,  cancer  registry  data  were  not  considered  adequate  to  sup-
port  rigorous  analysis.  Since  ATSDR’s  work,  the  Puerto  Rico  cancer  registry  has
made significant progress. We may consider using these data to address the concern
about the cancer rate on Vieques.
