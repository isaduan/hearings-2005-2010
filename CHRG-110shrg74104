700  MHz  AUCTION:  PUBLIC  SAFETY 

AND  COMPETITION  ISSUES 

THURSDAY,  JUNE  14,  2007 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:02  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Daniel  K.  Inouye, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

The CHAIRMAN. The broadcasters are required by law to turn off 
their  analog  signals  on  February  17,  2009.  As  we  approach  this 
deadline, the FCC faces decisions that will shape the future of pub-
lic  safety  and  commercial  communications  services.  The  Commis-
sion  appears  ready,  at  long  last,  to  adopt  final  service  rules  that 
will  govern  the  auction  and  reuse  of  frequencies  in  the  700  MHz 
band. As with most communications policies that offer great prom-
ise,  the  700  MHz  band  auction  also  offers  great  complexity.  But  if 
history  is  our  guide,  the  decisions  that  the  FCC  will  soon  make  in 
establishing  service  rules  have  the  potential  to  revolutionize  the 
communications landscape and to lay the foundation for the future 
development  and  deployment  of  new  wireless  broadband  services. 
Because  radio  waves  operating  in  the  700  MHz  band  can  travel 
long  distances  and  can  penetrate  through  walls,  they  are  uniquely 
capable of extending next-generation broadband services to parts of 
America  that  current  technologies  fail  to  reach.  As  some  have 
noted,  these  frequencies  are  the  equivalent  of  the  new  beachfront 
property  in  the  increasingly  crowded  market  for  spectrum  real  es-
tate. 

For  public  safety,  the  stakes  are  very  high.  In  many  cities,  their 
narrow-band  voice  communications  systems  already  chafe  under 
capacity  constraints.  For  that  reason,  we  must  ensure  that  our 
band clearing efforts stay on track. 

In  addition,  our  efforts  must  also  recognize  that  the  future  of 
public  safety  does  not  depend  on  voice  communications  alone.  The 
700 MHz proceeding offers our country a unique—and perhaps his-
toric—opportunity to establish rules that will promote the develop-
ment  and  operation  of  next-generation  broadband  networks  for 
public safety. With proper planning and safeguards, these networks 
could be designed, from the outset, to be interoperable. They could 
reap the benefits of greater economies of scale and promote greater 
efficiency in the use of scarce spectrum resources.

2 

Without  question,  the  concept  of  a  partnership  between  public 
safety  and  a  commercial  operator,  as  some  have  suggested,  would 
represent  a  paradigm  shift  in  the  way  traditional  public  safety 
communications  have  been  managed  and  operated.  It  raises  many 
difficult questions that must be carefully considered and answered. 
But  the  difficulty  of  the  task  should  not  alter  the  responsibility 
of our regulators to meet the needs of first responders and to facili-
tate the development and use of cutting-edge communications tech-
nologies  that  will  be  essential  to  protecting  the  safety  of  current 
and future generations. 

In  my  opinion,  we  are  well  past  the  question  of  whether  we 
should  help  first  responders  build  and  operate  a  nationwide  inter-
operable  broadband  network.  Instead,  it  is  time  that  we  focus  on 
what we must do to accomplish this goal as quickly as possible. 

In  addition  to  the  unique  opportunities  that  service  rules  may 
offer  for  public  safety,  the  upcoming  auction  of  commercial  spec-
trum has the potential to reward consumers with substantial bene-
fits  in  the  rollout  of  new  wireless  broadband  services.  Yet,  despite 
such  promise,  there  are  lingering  concerns  that  the  FCC’s  current 
service  rules,  which  favor  large  spectrum  blocks  and  large  geo-
graphic license areas will limit participation in the auction and will 
provide  established  incumbents  with  an  opportunity  to  strengthen 
their control over existing spectrum resources. 

While changes to these rules are under consideration, it is impor-
tant that the Commission recognize the dangers of further consoli-
dation and adopt rules that will attract new entrants and promote 
competition. 

Similarly, it is my hope that the Commission will remember that 
a  spectrum  auction  represents  a  means  to  an  end,  not  an  end  in 
itself. There is no question that the auction of 700 MHz frequencies 
will  yield  the  Treasury  substantial  sums  of  money,  but  we  should 
not let that fact seduce us into forgetting the importance of design-
ing service rules that also meet other critical policy goals. This auc-
tion  must  ensure  a  diversity  of  license  ownership,  promote  Uni-
versal  Service  and  the  deployment  of  services  beyond  major  cities 
and  highways,  and  encourage  entrepreneurship  and  the  develop-
ment of innovative technologies and applications that will stoke de-
mand for highspeed service. In sum, there’s a lot at stake. 

We  are  fortunate  today  to  have  two  distinguished  panels  of  wit-
nesses  to  assist  us  in  examining  these  issues.  And  I  look  forward 
to their testimony and their answers to our questions. 

But,  before  I  do,  may  I  call  upon  the  distinguished  Vice  Chair-

man of the Committee? 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  I  was  late.  If  my  friend  is  ready,  go 

ahead. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. I’d yield to you. 
Senator STEVENS. Thank you. 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator STEVENS. Well, I applaud my good friend, the Chairman, 
for  calling  this  hearing  to  examine  the  700  MHz  auction  and  the 
public safety issues.

We’re now 4 months closer to the 700 MHz auction than the last 
time the Committee held a hearing looking at the public safety pro-
posal  that  would  use  some  of  the  auctioned  spectrum.  This  new 
proposal  involves  less  spectrum  for  auction,  and  does  not  fix  the 
price  in  advance.  Still,  there  are,  to  me,  outstanding  questions  to 
be  resolved,  and  I  hope  the  witnesses  will  answer  many  of  the 
questions  regarding  how  this  public  service—how  this  will  serve 
the  public  safety  interests  and  the  interests  of  the  American  tax-
payers,  as  well  as  really  control  the  spectrum.  I  think  that’s  the 
primary  issue,  as  far  as  I’m  concerned.  It’s  important  that  all  pro-
posals  be  examined  to  ensure  that  Congress  is  doing  as  much  as 
we  possibly  can  to  save  the  lives  of  our  first  responders,  and  help 
them save other lives. But we must also be sure that we’re not al-
ways  examining,  and  never  acting.  We  must  make  some  decisions 
now on this proposal. 

Separately,  we’ll  hear,  I  understand,  a  discussion  of  new  pro-
posals  for  the  rules  surrounding  the  commercial  side  of  the  700 
MHz auction. Some of those issues are technical in nature, and im-
pact  business  plans  and  business  strategies.  By  the  end  of  our 
hearing, I hope that some common themes will emerge so the FCC 
can  move  forward  in  conjunction  with  Congress,  and  so  we  can  all 
agree, and, in a timely fashion, hold this auction in a way that will 
secure  the  24  MHz  of  spectrum  in  the  700  MHz  bands  for  public 
safety  on  time,  provide  new  wireless  opportunities  for  consumers 
and  small  businesses,  and  ensure  that  taxpayers  receive  the  full 
value for the use of the spectrum that’s dedicated to the public in-
terest. 

Thank you very much. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator DeMint? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JIM DEMINT, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA 

Senator DEMINT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
In  the  interest  of  time,  I’d  like  to  submit  my  entire  statement 

here for the record and just make a couple of comments. 

Thank you for—— 
The CHAIRMAN. Without objection. 
Senator DEMINT. Thank you, sir. 
[The prepared statement of Senator DeMint follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JIM DEMINT, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA 
Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  scheduling  this  hearing.  I  also  want  to  thank  the 

panelists with us today. 

The amount of activity and interest in this DTV transition just goes to show how 
very  important  and  valuable  this  public  asset—the  700  MHz  spectrum—is  to  our 
economy, our public safety, and our individual constituents’ daily lives. 

After  much  hard  work  and  many  long  years,  we  are  finally  close—within 
months—of  realizing  the  opportunities  that  the  700  MHz  spectrum  presents.  With 
this spectrum finally cleared and licensed, we will have more tools to attack difficult 
issues  like  public  safety  interoperability,  universal  service,  and  the  digital  divide. 
It  is  vitally  important  that  we  move  ahead  with  wireless  broadband  in  this  Na-
tion.  Beyond  mobility  and  the  potential  ‘‘third  pipe’’  it  will  offer  into  American 
homes, it presents us with a great chance to leapfrog where we are today with fund-
ing  less  efficient  and  more  expensive  technologies  through  our  Universal  Service 
Fund.

Innovation  will  only  increase  as  commercial  applications  and  consumer  demand 
grow  in  this  space.  That  is  why  it  is  vital  that  the  FCC  develop  flexible  rules  that 
allow  current  providers  as  well  as  new  entrants  the  ability  to  bid  on  this  spectrum 
and develop it as the market demands. 

But,  we  aren’t  there  yet.  The  Commission  has  some  big  decisions  to  make,  hope-

fully in the coming weeks, about the rules for this auction. Those include: 

1. whether to competitively auction all of the 60 MHz remaining for commercial 
services; 
2. the geographic sizes of the licenses to be auctioned; 
3. and what, if any, usage rules to impose on the winning bidders. 

Mr.  Chairman,  several  of  my  fellow  colleagues  joined  me  in  a  letter  this  week  to 
the  FCC  Commissioners  outlining  our  thoughts  on  the  proceedings  currently  under-
way. I would like to ask consent to make this part of the record. 

I  believe  it  is  important  that  the  entire  60  MHz  of  available  spectrum  be  auc-
tioned competitively. This means that there should not be special restrictions placed 
on any portion of it that would either suppress interest from other bidders or benefit 
a particular business model. I urge the Commission to avoid weakening or skewing 
the role of market forces in this auction process. 

There are some who seek more spectrum for public safety interoperability in addi-
tion  to  the  24  MHz  already  set  aside.  While  I  appreciate  their  sincerity  and  good 
intentions,  I  do  feel  that  they  seem  to  have  made  up  their  minds  before  we  have 
had  a  chance  to  actually  get  to  the  24  MHz  already  set  aside  and  fully  develop  its 
potential.  Also,  I  feel  there  are  great  opportunities  for  the  public  safety  community 
with  the  spectrum,  technologies,  and  public/private  partnerships  already  available 
today. 

As  for  the  appropriate  size  of  licenses,  I  believe  that  the  Commission  should  be 
guided by what is best for the American people and not individual bidders. The win-
ners  of  this  auction,  if  conducted  properly,  will  be  consumers.  They  should  expect 
the  benefits  of  more  options,  lower  costs,  and  better  services.  There  is  a  place  for 
smaller,  more  localized  licenses,  and  I  feel  the  Commission’s  Lower-700  MHz  band 
plan accounts for this. 

But, there is clearly value in large-area licenses, as well. I know my constituents 
are  ready  for  nationwide  mobility  and  wireless  broadband  speeds  comparable  to 
DSL  and  cable.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  most  efficient  way  to  get  there  is  to  offer 
bidders the opportunity to provide services immediately to a wide area and substan-
tial population. 

Finally,  I  urge  the  Commission  to  avoid  imposing  rules  on  the  services  provided 
by  winning  bidders  like  net  neutrality  or  open  access  requirements.  Government 
regulation has not created 200 million wireless phone users in our country. Neither 
has it made wireless Internet the viable option it is becoming today. These develop-
ments  have  occurred  because  the  market  has  been  allowed  to  work  and  innovate, 
and  competition  has  been  presented  to  consumers.  As  always,  regulation  in  search 
of  a  problem  should  be  avoided,  and  I  urge  the  Commission  to  do  so  in  this  case. 
Thank  you  again,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  thoughts  of  my 

colleagues and our panelists. 

Washington, DC, June 13, 2007 

U.S. SENATE, 

Hon. KEVIN J. MARTIN, 
Chairman, 
Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Chairman Martin, 

We  are  writing  to  express  support  for  improving  our  Nation’s  public  safety  com-
munications, expanding wireless broadband for consumers, and maximizing value to 
U.S.  taxpayers.  Specifically,  we  support  your  efforts  to  bring  broadband  capability 
to  the  24  MHz  Congress  allocated  for  public  safety  use  in  the  Digital  Television 
Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005. 

To facilitate wireless broadband, particularly in rural areas, we believe that a mix 
of  license  sizes  for  the  700  MHz  auction  is  critical.  Larger  licenses  are  needed  to 
facilitate  next-generation  wireless  networks  and  will  bring  more  broadband  choices 
to U.S. consumers sooner, while smaller license areas are essential to create oppor-
tunities for small and mid-sized wireless carriers.

In  the  past,  disregarding  Congressional  intent  for  market-driven  auction  policy 
has resulted in spectrum lying fallow for years, extensive litigation, and consumers 
being  denied  the  benefits  of  wireless  technology  innovations.  The  FCC  should  not 
devise  encumbering  rules  which  suppress  interest  in  the  auction,  including  build- 
out requirements, restrictions on incumbent bidding, net neutrality, and open access 
mandates. 

We hope that your auction rules will maximize the benefits of this important pub-

lic asset and appreciate your prompt action in this proceeding. 

Sincerely, 

JIM DEMINT

JOHN E. SUNUNU

DAVID VITTER 

Senator  DEMINT.  I  want  to  thank  both  panels.  I  can’t  stay  for 
both  of  them,  but  I  appreciate  the  wisdom,  hopefully,  they’ll  bring 
today. 

I know, Mr. Chairman, you mentioned some concerns about con-
solidation  and  the  need  for,  really,  a  diversity  of  competition  and 
to stir innovation, which is certainly my hope, as well. 

We  have  to  find  a  balance  between  the  number  of  competitors 
and  the  ability  of  larger  networks  to  provide  national  and  inter-
national  service.  It’s  very  important  that  the  way  this  auction 
works  would  allow  the  larger  companies  to  establish  a  seamless 
network.  That  form  of  consolidation  is  certainly  not  negative,  and 
that’s  the  balance  I  hope  we  can  achieve,  because  ultimately  it’s 
what  the  customers  need  that  matters,  which  is  a  seamless  na-
tional/international  network,  and  future  of  highspeed  broadband 
that  is  wireless,  which  would  require  certain  chunks  of  that  spec-
trum be available to networks who want to provide it. 

So, that’s what I hope we can come out with today, is a way that 
we  can  encourage  a  lot  of  competition,  innovation,  the  diversity  of 
competition;  at  the  same  time,  allow  the  networks,  with  the  capa-
bility,  to  provide—or  to  purchase  large  enough  chunks  and  band-
width  to  provide  the  services  that  customers  will  need  in  the  fu-
ture. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank you. 
Senator Rockefeller? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I’ll shorten this. 
Obviously, we can’t underestimate the potential for the 700 MHz 
auction  to  transform  society.  The  FCC  has  to  recognize,  has  to 
maximize,  the  public-interest  benefit  of  this  auction.  Spectrum  is 
highly  valuable,  it’s  very  scarce,  it  does  not  belong  to  any  broad-
casters;  it  belongs  only  to  the  American  people,  and  is  only  used 
with the consent of us. 

Congress  and  the  FCC,  as  guardians  of  this  scarce  public  re-
source, must make sure all Americans benefit from this sale. In my 
opinion,  the  FCC  must  address  two  fundamental  questions  when

Stevens  indicated,  are  addressed.  We  have  totally  failed  with  re-
spect  to  this.  We  have  added  homeland  security  responsibilities 
without  providing  the  resources  to  meet  these  new  challenges.  We 
have  not  adequately  addressed  the  issue  of  interoperability.  Now, 
if  the  FCC  fails  to  develop  an  adequate  spectrum  plan  that  ad-
dresses  the  needs  of  public  safety,  policymakers  will  have  failed 
them once again, and we may not be able to rectify that in the fu-
ture. 

As my good friend, Commissioner Copps has stated, the question 
of  public  safety  is  the  first  obligation  of  the  public  servant.  In  a 
more  perfect  world,  our  Nation’s  first  responders  would  already 
have  access  to  an  interoperable  and  fully  funded  broadband  net-
work  that  makes  use  of  dedicated  public  safety  spectrum.  We  are 
a  very  long  way  from  getting  that,  particularly  in  our  rural  areas, 
and this is something we should all be very much ashamed of. 

I  voted  against  the  last  spectrum  bill,  Mr.  Chairman,  because  I 
thought  it  was  just  a  money  grab.  It  wasn’t  thought  out.  And  I 
think—Senator  Stevens  might  not  agree  on  this,  but  I  think  it’s 
really  important  that  the  FCC  gets  it  right  before  it  presents  the 
auction. The American public does not understand spectrum. Com-
mittee  attendance  is  sparse  here  today.  Those  who  are  here  do 
care.  But  it’s  very  much  like  aviation—very  important  subject,  not 
a lot of attendance, not a lot of knowledge. 

But  the  consequences  of  this  are  overwhelming.  And  if  it  meant 
that  we  had  to  give  the  FCC,  depending  upon  where  they  stand— 
and  I’m  not  confident  of  where  they  stand—an  extra  2  months  to 
prepare  for  an  auction,  then  I  think  we  should  do  that.  But  if  this 
is  just  another  effort  to  raise  money  for  the  Federal  Government, 
I’m going to vote against it again. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Rockefeller follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

The 700 Megahertz (700 MHz) proceeding before the FCC is extraordinarily com-
plex even for communications policy. I believe that the upcoming auction is perhaps 
the  most  important  that  the  FCC  will  ever  conduct.  It  is  undeniable  that  the  out-
come  of  the  FCC’s  decisions  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  development  of 
next  generation  broadband  networks  for  public  safety  and  on  the  competitive  land-
scape for wireless broadband services in the United States. 

As this Committee has heard on numerous occasions, the soon-to-be freed-up 700 
Megahertz (MHz) variety is among the most valuable spectrum of all because of its 
uniquely favorable propagation characteristics. This spectrum is crucial for bringing 
new wireless broadband services to our Nation. We cannot underestimate its poten-
tial to transform society. 

The  FCC  must  maximize  the  public  interest  benefit  of  this  auction.  Spectrum  is 
a  highly  valuable  and  scarce  resource.  It  belongs  to  West  Virginians.  It  belongs  to 
the  American  people.  Congress  and  the  FCC,  as  guardians  of  this  scarce  public  re-
source, must make sure all Americans benefit from its sale. 

In  my  opinion,  the  FCC  must  address  two  fundamental  questions  when  devel-
oping the rules for this auction. First, we must make sure that the spectrum needs 
of the public safety community are addressed. For too long, Congress has failed our 
first  responders.  We  have  added  homeland  security  responsibilities  without  pro-
viding the resources to meet these new challenges, and we have not adequately ad-
dressed  the  issue  of  interoperability.  Now,  if  the  FCC  fails  to  develop  an  adequate 
spectrum  plan  that  addresses  the  needs  of  public  safety,  policymakers  will  have 
failed them once again. And, we may not ever be able to rectify this failure. 

As my good friend Commissioner Copps has stated, ‘‘the question of public safety 
is. . .the  first  obligation  of  the  public  servant.’’  In  a  more  perfect  world,  our  Na-

tion’s first responders would already have access to an interoperable and fully-fund-
ed  broadband  network  that  makes  use  of  dedicated  public  safety  spectrum.  We  are 
a  long  way  from  getting  public  safety  this  network,  and  that  is  something  we  all 
should be ashamed of. 

The  FCC  should  consider  a  number  of  innovative  new  approaches  to  addressing 
this  issue.  I  am  not  ready  to  endorse  any  one  of  them,  but  it  is  incumbent  upon 
the FCC to evaluate these proposals. The public interest demands it. 

The basic idea of a network that will be used by both commercial and public safe-
ty  users  is  deeply  appealing  to  me,  with  commercial  users  generating  enough  rev-
enue to build and operate the network and with public safety users able to preempt 
commercial  users  during  an  emergency.  But,  I  understand  the  many  challenges  be-
fore the FCC and the industry in making this goal a reality. 

I  believe  that  the  second  issue  the  FCC  must  address,  as  it  seeks  to  maximize 
the  public  benefit,  is  how  to  make  sure  all  Americans,  especially  rural  Americans, 
are  provided  the  new  and  innovative  wireless  services  that  this  auction  is  certain 
to bring. 

Wireless  services  in  my  state  are  inadequate.  Vast  stretches  of  West  Virginia  do 
not have wireless voice coverage, much less data coverage. Again, let me state that 
spectrum belongs to all Americans and the FCC rules need to make sure all Ameri-
cans benefit from the new services and competition that companies using this spec-
trum will bring to consumers. 

When  the  Congress  voted  to  auction  the  existing  broadcast  spectrum,  this  Com-
mittee’s  only  concern  was  raising  as  much  money  for  the  Treasury  as  possible.  I 
voted against that bill because without marrying it to good public policy, we achieve 
nothing.  The  FCC’s  highest  priority  is  making  sure  that  the  700  MHZ  auction  is 
done  to  maximize  the  public  interest  and  just  not  to  maximize  the  revenue  to  the 
treasury. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Lautenberg? 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
Obviously,  this  is  a  fairly  complicated  subject,  but  one  that  we 
must  deal  with,  and  deal  with  as  fairly  and  equitably  as  we  can. 
The  700  MHz  spectrum  has  been  described  as  the  beachfront 
property  of  the  spectrum,  which  implies  the  most  valuable  part  of 
the  land  or  the  property.  And  so,  first  we  have  to  make  sure  that 
we  maximize  its  availability.  It’s  a  limited,  valuable  resource,  and 
so, we’ve got to do the best that we can to use it. 

Second,  we  want  to  protect  it.  Whoever  controls  that  property 
must  act  with  the  interest  of  the  public  as  its  primary  obligation. 
In  terms  of  that  analogy,  the  same  is  true  for  the  700  MHz  spec-
trum. Spectrum is a valuable natural resource. It’s a small portion 
of  the  public  airwaves  that  could  bring  inexpensive  highspeed  and 
wireless  Internet  across  to  customers,  the  biggest  companies,  as 
well as to the ordinary American in a public park or a coffee shop, 
because of its ability to travel at great speeds and great distances, 
able  to  penetrate  walls.  Many  said  it  could  be  the  backbone  of  a 
national  wireless  broadband  network.  And  we  know  we’ve  got  to 
improve access to broadband. 

The  United  States  lags  15th  in  the  world  in  the  percentage  of 
people  with  broadband  connections,  according  to  the  International 
Telecommunications  Union.  Considering  that  the  Internet  access 
today is essential for everything from communications to education, 
public  safety,  we’ve  got  to  improve  our  situation,  relative  to  the 
rest of the world and the needs of our people. We’ve got to explore 
every  option  for  increasing  broadband  deployment.  For  example,  I 
have proposed allowing cities and towns to provide broadband net-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 02, 2012 Jkt 074104 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74104.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

8 

works  of  their  own  to  their  residents,  and  the  700  MHz  spectrum 
creates a new opportunity to provide widespread broadband access. 
It has also got to improve public safety’s ability to communicate. 
Senator Rockefeller mentioned something. A significant part of the 
casualties  on  9/11  were  people  from  New  Jersey  and  we  found  out 
that  the  inability  to  communicate  was  a  real  deterrent  to  rescuing 
these people. And we still don’t know what the aftereffects of expo-
sure there are. 

So,  we’ve  got  to  find  a  way  to  ensure  that  local  police  and  fire-
fighters in our large cities can speak to one another, and also look 
ahead  to  make  sure  that  their  equipment  in  the  future  is  capable 
of  exchanging  data  and  video  over  broadband.  The  700  MHz  spec-
trum will also benefit those costs. As we explore this spectrum with 
the  auction,  we’ve  got  to  make  sure  that  a  system  is  in  place  that 
both  generates  revenue  for  our  businesses  and  guarantees  this  re-
source is used for the public good. 

And,  Mr.  Chairman,  one  of  the  things  that  I’d  like  to  make  sure 
that  we  go  into  with  a  degree  of  depth,  and  that  is  this  can’t  be 
an  asset  that’s  casually  held  and—I’ll  use  the  term  ‘‘flipped’’—for 
a  profit,  that  this  has  to  be  put  to  the  public  use,  and  some 
warrantees or guarantees that that’s the objective. 

So,  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  thank  all  of  the  witnesses 

for your participation. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
Senator Sununu? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 

Senator SUNUNU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I’d  like  to  just  make  three  points  in  my  opening  statement,  and 
the  first  is  simple,  and  may  be  the  most  important,  that  we  need 
to  complete  this  process.  We  absolutely  need  to  get  this  done.  The 
law  says  we  need  to  get  this  done—January  28,  2008.  And  we 
should certainly stick to the law. Completing the process in a time-
ly way is right for consumers. And getting them access to the spec-
trum that Senator Lautenberg was talking about, whether it’s addi-
tional  wireless  services,  broadband,  or  other  innovations  that  we 
can’t quite foresee, completing the process is essential. It’s right for 
public  safety,  as  well,  getting  them  access  to  the  additional  spec-
trum  that  really  will  make  a  difference,  in  the  long  run,  to  their 
ability  to  communicate,  and  also  to  adapt  new  services  for  their 
own public safety needs. 

Second fundamental point is, we need to avoid regulations, man-
dates,  encumbrances  on  the  spectrum  that’s  being  auctioned  off. 
Every  regulation,  every  mandate,  every  additional  requirement  we 
place  on  this  spectrum  is  going  to  reduce  the  number  of  competi-
tors that come forward to bid, it’s going to reduce investment in the 
systems,  it’s  going  to  reduce  innovation,  and,  ultimately,  that’s 
going  to  hurt  the  interested  parties:  consumers  and  public  safety. 
And,  finally,  with  regard  to  the  question  of  interoperability,  we 
hear  a  lot  of  talk  about  interoperability,  how  important  it  is,  how 
much  we  care  about  it.  We’re  going  to  allocate  funds  to  support 
interoperability,  as  we  should,  those  funds  coming  from  this  auc-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 02, 2012 Jkt 074104 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74104.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

9 

tion.  But  the  biggest  problem  that  I  see  in  the  area  of  interoper-
ability isn’t the availability of funds, per se, but it’s the reluctance, 
in  many  cases,  of  first  responding  organizations  themselves  to  em-
brace open standards, to embrace new technologies, and even to co-
ordinate their own purchasing across different organizations. There 
are  counties,  even  some  cities,  in  America  where  police  and  fire 
fighters  still  can’t  communicate  effectively  with  one  another.  And 
that’s  not  for  a  lack  of  spectrum.  And,  in  many  cases,  it’s  not  for 
a  lack  of  funding,  but  for  a  lack  of  coordination  and  organization, 
setting aside turf issues and working together on a coordinated ac-
quisition plan. 

So, we need to focus on interoperability, insofar as getting the re-
sources  available  at  the  Federal  level  to  support  some  of  these  ac-
quisition efforts, but I think there’s also a change in approach and 
in mentality that needs to go along. 

This  is  very  important  to  get  done,  to  get  done  in  a  timely  way, 
and get done in a way that really supports the needs of consumers 
and  public  safety,  and  I  hope  some  of  the  obstacles  and  hurdles  to 
getting  that  done  in  a  timely  way  are  discussed  in  earnest  today. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
Before proceeding, I’d like to recognize the presence of a very dis-
tinguished  former  Chairman  of  this  Committee,  Senator  John  C. 
Danforth.

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Smith? 

STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Senator SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this hearing. 
The  auction  of  700  MHz  band  presents  a  unique  opportunity  to 
both  improve  our  Nation’s  public  safety  communications  and  ex-
pand  wireless  broadband  access  for  consumers.  I  encourage  the 
FCC  to  expeditiously  adopt  service  rules  that  facilitate  expanded 
wireless broadband service offerings for consumers in rural commu-
nities and large cities, alike. 

But  I’d  like  to  speak,  this  morning,  a  bit  about  the  opportunity 
this  auction  presents  for  public  safety  and  the  tremendous  work 
being  done  in  my  home  State  of  Oregon  regarding  public  safety 
communications. 

The  Oregon  State  Interoperability  Executive  Council  is  chaired 
by Chief Jeff Johnson of the Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue, with 
whom  I  met  earlier  this  year.  The  Council  has  been  charged  with 
achieving  public  safety  interoperability  in  Oregon.  The  group  has 
been  meeting  for  a  few  years.  The  Council  has  spent  countless 
hours,  beyond  their  public  service  day  jobs,  to  design  a  statewide 
interoperable  network.  Following  completion  of  the  design  for  the 
network,  the  Council  took  the  plan  of—for  interoperability  to  the 
state government for funding. The Oregon State Legislature, unfor-

10 

tunately, was unable to fund the $665 million needed to build this 
network. 

The  Oregon  State  Legislature,  like  so  many  others  across  the 
country,  having  limited  resources  and  any  number  of  demands  on 
it,  determined  it  could  not  finance  a  statewide  interoperability 
project  for  Oregon.  I  suspect  this  scenario  will  be  replicated  in 
every  one  of  the  30-plus  states  that  have  state  interoperability  ex-
ecutive councils trying to resolve interoperability at the State level. 
Knowing  that  these  resources  are  largely  unavailable  at  the 
State  and  local  level,  and  predicting  that  it  would  be  equally  dif-
ficult to find funds at the national level, if we are to be pragmatic, 
we  must  turn  to  solutions  that  could  include  the  private  sector. 
This  is  not  unprecedented.  There  are  a  number  of  occasions  where 
collaboration  between  the  public  and  commercial  sectors  has  yield-
ed  highly  effective  results.  In  my  view,  the  FCC  and  this  Com-
mittee, where appropriate, must take an active role in making this 
work. 

As many of us know, the FCC is already taking steps to facilitate 
such a nationwide shared network. While I do not necessarily agree 
with every aspect of this proposal being considered by the Commis-
sion,  I  applaud  the  steps  that  have  been  taken  to  recognize  both 
the problem and the opportunity presented for public safety. 

This endeavor must be made a nationwide priority. We must cre-
ate  the  road  to  nationwide  interoperability.  The  example  of  State 
and  local  experience  demonstrates  that  the  solution  must  come  on 
a  national  level.  Let’s  not  wait  until  the  next  disaster  to  start 
working  on  the  creation  of  a  nationwide  mobile  public  safety 
broadband network. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Lott? 
Senator LOTT. Mr. Chairman, thank you for having this hearing. 
And  I’m  anxious  to  hear  the  panel,  so  I  will  reserve  my  comments 
for later.

Senator Klobuchar? 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you  for 

holding this hearing today. 

The 700 MHz auction gives us a unique opportunity in the public 
safety  area.  I  come  to  the  Senate  having  been  a  prosecutor  for  8 
years  and  running  an  office  of  400  people,  with  a  county  that  has 
1.1  million  people.  I  was  very  proud  of  the  work  that  our  sheriff, 
Pat  McGowan,  who  has  recently  retired,  but  he  was  head  of  the 
National  Sheriffs  Association,  the  work  he  did  in  bringing  inter-
operability  to  our  town.  Some  of  this  came  out  of  a  case  that  was 
in the metropolitan area in the Twin Cities, where a St. Paul police 
officer  was  shot.  Several  different  police  officers  had  to  pitch  in  to 
find the killers. The helicopter pilots assisting in the search had to 
carry  12  different  portable  radios  with  them  so  that  they  could  in-
dividually radio each police department. This obviously led to some 
serious  discussions  in  our  area.  Now,  not  only  does  Hennepin

County,  but  the  nine  counties  that  make  up  the  Twin  Cities  area 
are now all interoperable. 

This truly isn’t the case in all of our State. I was just up, 2 weeks 
ago,  in  the  Grand  Marais  area,  way  up  on  the  Canadian  border, 
where  we  just,  tragically,  had  weeks  of  wildfires  that  started  in 
Minnesota  and  then  went  up  to  Canada.  In  Minnesota  alone,  200 
buildings  were  destroyed,  acres  and  acres  and  acres  of  forest.  And 
there, I heard the same story that we heard as in the St. Paul Po-
lice  Department  issue,  where  there  just  was  not  interoperability, 
and there are all kinds of problems with communicating, where you 
have situations where they have to get to a house and get the peo-
ple  evacuated.  And  what  they  ended  up  being  able  to  use  was  the 
community  radio  station,  which,  luckily,  stayed  available  in  most 
of  their  homes  so  they  could  give  alerts  of  when  different  parts  of 
the State were being evacuated. 

So,  that’s  why  I  have  come  to  this  hearing  with  this  very  recent 
and  poignant  experience.  And  I’m  hopeful  that  we  will  hear  some 
good solutions to this very important issue. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
For our first panel of witnesses, we are most pleased to have the

Ms. MCCARLEY. Good morning. 
The CHAIRMAN. Good morning. 
Ms.  MCCARLEY.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman 
Stevens, and members of the Committee, for this opportunity to ap-

Communications  Officials—International,  APCO,  and  the  National 
Public Safety Telecommunications Council, NPSTC. 

My  name  is  Wanda  McCarley,  and  I  am  the  Operations  and 
Training  Manager  for  the  Tarrant  County  9-1-1  District  in  Fort

the  International  Association  of  Fire  Chiefs,  and  I  speak  on  their 
behalf today here, as well. 

Public  safety  agencies  throughout  the  Nation  have  long  had  a 
critical  need  for  additional  spectrum  to  alleviate  radio  system  con-

gestion, to accommodate new communications tools, and to promote 
improved  interoperability.  Our  Nation’s  first  responders  will  need 
further  spectrum  resources  to  deal  with  the  ever-growing  demand 
for expanded voice, data, video, and broadband capability. 

We have also come to recognize that our country needs a national 
broadband  network.  This  network  must  be  built  to  public  safety 
specifications,  and  it  must  be  controlled  by  public  safety  entities. 
It  should  also  leverage  economies  of  scale  while  still  meeting  local 
needs.  Such  a  network  will  allow  for  more  efficient  use  of  scarce 
spectrum,  facilitate  national  standards,  reduce  costs  for  State  and 
local  governments,  and,  most  importantly,  promote  nationwide 
interoperability. 

The FCC now has before it a one-time opportunity to provide for 
a public safety broadband network through its consideration of the 
700  MHz  auction  rules.  The  public  safety  community  has  strongly 
urged the Commission to use this opportunity to establish the foun-
dation  for  a  public/private  partnership  that  would  deploy  a  fully 
interoperable nationwide public safety broadband network. 

Specifically,  we  have  urged  the  FCC  to  impose  conditions  on  the 
auction  to  promote  a  shared  network  that  would  create  a  synergy 
to provide first responders with access to additional spectrum while 
also leveraging the commercial spectrum. 

We  believe  there  is  simply  no  other  viable  method  to  fund  a  na-
tional broadband network for public safety. With the funding mech-
anism  some  local  agencies  may  have,  they  may  be  able  to  fund 
local  networks,  others  will  not,  and  this  creates  a  patchwork  of 
have and have-nots with access to the system. 

Some  have  suggested  that  the  Federal  Government  provide  the 
dollars necessary to build a national network. While we would obvi-
ously  welcome  some  Federal  funding,  we  know  how  difficult  that 
would be to achieve in this current budgetary environment. Others 
have suggested that public safety agencies simply rely on commer-
cial networks. However, commercial-grade networks are not usually 
built  to  public  safety  specifications.  Adequate  coverage,  reliability, 
functionality,  and  security  are  known  issues.  We  believe  the  only 
viable  option  to  fund  a  national  public  safety  broadband  network 
is through a public-private partnership. 

The  FCC  first  addressed  the  potential  for  a  public/private  part-
nership  last  year,  when  it  proposed  that  a  portion  of  the  700  MHz 
band already allocated for public safety be assigned to a single na-
tional public safety licensee. However, that licensee would not have 
the  funding  to  deploy  the  network.  Some  have  suggested  that  the 
national  public  safety  licensee  could  simply  issue  an  RFP  seeking 
a partner to construct the network. The question still remains, how 
would the national public safety licensee pay for the network? 

This  brings  us  to  the  innovative  conditional  auction  approach 
that we believe is the best alternative. A key component of this ap-
proach  is  a  network-sharing  agreement  with  the  national  public 
safety licensee. We have urged that the FCC rules ensure that pub-
lic safety is not forced into an unacceptable network-sharing agree-
ment,  and  that  the  agreement  must  be  negotiated  prior  to  the 
issuance of the license to the auction winner. We believe that these 
are  key  components  for  the  deployment  of  a  national  broadband 
network.

Mr.  Chairman,  in  conclusion,  we  believe  that  the  FCC  should 
adopt a conditional auction approach that requires the auction win-
ner  to  build  a  broadband  network  that  serves  both  public  safety 
and  commercial  users,  and  is  designed,  built,  and  maintained  to 
meet public safety requirements. 

I  thank  you,  again,  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you 

today. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. McCarley follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WANDA S.  MCCARLEY,  OPERATIONS AND TRAINING MAN-
AGER,  TARRANT COUNTY 9-1-1  DISTRICT,  FORT WORTH,  TEXAS;  PRESIDENT,  ASSO-
CIATION OF PUBLIC-SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS OFFICIALS—INTERNATIONAL (APCO); 
BOARD MEMBER,  NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIONS COUNCIL 
(NPSTC) 
Thank  you  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  and  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee  for  this  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  on  behalf  of  the  Association 
of  Public-Safety  Communications  Officials—International  (APCO)  and  the  National 
Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC). 

My name is Wanda McCarley and I am the Operations and Training Manager for 
Tarrant  County  9-1-1  District  in  Fort  Worth,  Texas.  I  am  currently  the  President 
of  APCO  and  also  serve  on  the  NPSTC  Governing  Board.  APCO  works  very  closely 
with  the  International  Association  of  Chiefs  of  Police  (IACP)  and  the  International 
Association  of  Fire  Chiefs  (IAFC),  both  of  which  are  also  members  of  NPSTC,  and 
I speak on their behalf today as well. 

APCO was established in 1935 and today it is the Nation’s oldest and largest pub-
lic  safety  communications  organization,  representing  its  16,000  members  who  man-
age  and  operate  communications  systems  and  facilities  for  police,  fire,  emergency 
medical  and  other  state  and  local  government  public  safety  agencies.  APCO’s  mis-
sion is to be a member driven association of communications professionals that pro-
vides  leadership;  influences  public  safety  communications  decisions  of  government 
and  industry;  promotes  professional  development;  and  fosters  the  development  and 
use of technology for the benefit of the public. 

The  National  Public  Safety  Telecommunications  Council  (NPSTC)  was  formed  10 
years  ago  to  serve  both  as  a  resource  and  advocate  for  public  safety  organizations 
in  the  United  States  on  matters  relating  to  public  safety  telecommunications. 
NPSTC  is  a  federation  of  public  safety  organizations  dedicated  to  encouraging  and 
facilitating,  through  its  collective  voice,  the  implementation  of  the  Public  Safety 
Wireless  Advisory  Committee  (PSWAC)  and  the  700  MHz  Public  Safety  National 
Coordination Committee (NCC) recommendations. NPSTC explores technologies and 
public  policy  involving  public  safety  agencies,  analyzes  the  ramifications  of  par-
ticular  issues,  and  submits  comments  to  governmental  bodies  with  the  objective  of 
furthering  public  safety  communications  worldwide.  NPSTC  serves  as  a  standing 
forum  for  the  exchange  of  ideas  and  information  for  effective  public  safety  tele-
communications. The following 14 organizations participate in NPSTC: 

American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials 
American Radio Relay League 
American Red Cross 
Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies 
Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials—International 
Forestry Conservation Communications Association 
International Association of Chiefs of Police 
International Association of Emergency Managers 
International Association of Fire Chiefs 
International Municipal Signal Association 
National Association of State Chief Information Officers 
National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Officials 
National Association of State Foresters 
National Association of State Telecommunications Directors 

Several  Federal  agencies  are  liaison  members  of  NPSTC.  These  include  the  De-
partment  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (SAFECOM  Program

and  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency),  Department  of  Commerce  (Na-
tional  Telecommunications  and  Information  Administration),  Department  of  the  In-
terior, and the Department of Justice (National Institute of Justice, CommTech Pro-
gram). 

Public safety agencies throughout the Nation have long had a critical need for ad-
ditional  spectrum  to  alleviate  radio  system  congestion,  to  provide  first  responders 
with new communications tools, and to promote improved interoperability. Respond-
ing  to  some  of  those  needs,  Congress  passed  legislation  10  years  ago  to  clear  the 
700 MHz band of TV broadcasters and to allocate 24 MHz of that spectrum for pub-
lic  safety,  with  the  remaining  spectrum  designated  for  auction.  The  FCC  has  al-
ready  established  initial  rules  for  the  700  MHz  public  safety  spectrum,  allocating 
half  of  the  24  MHz  for  narrowband  voice  channels  (some  of  which  are  already  in 
use),  and  the  remainder  for  data  and  reserve  channels.1 However,  in  much  of  the 
Nation use of the spectrum is blocked by incumbent TV stations until February 17, 
2009. 

This allocation of 24 MHz of public safety spectrum was based upon needs identi-
fied  over  10  years  ago.  However,  even  then,  the  Public  Safety  Wireless  Advisory 
Committee  had  estimated  that  public  safety  would  require  an  additional  70  MHz 
by the year 2010. The reality of course, is that public safety’s spectrum needs have 
grown  faster  than  anyone  had  anticipated,  driven  in  part  by  9/11  and  the  Nation’s 
refocusing on public safety and homeland security requirements. 

Our  nation’s  first  responders  will  need  further  spectrum  resources  to  accommo-
date  the  ever  growing  demand  for  expanded  voice,  data,  video  and  other 
‘‘broadband’’  communications  capability.  We  have  also  come  to  recognize  that  our 
country needs a national broadband network that is built to public safety specifica-
tions,  is  controlled  by  public  safety  entities,  and  accommodates  local  variations  to 
address first responder agency requirements. Such a network will allow for more ef-
ficient  use  of  scarce  spectrum  resources,  facilitate  national  standards,  reduce  costs 
for  state  and  local  governments,  and  most  importantly,  promote  nationwide  inter-
operability on a state-of-the-art communications system. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) now has before it a one-time op-
portunity to provide for such a public safety broadband network through its consid-
eration  of  the  700  MHz  auction  rules.2 The  public  safety  community  has  strongly 
urged the Commission to use this opportunity to establish the foundation for a pub-
lic-private  partnership  that  would  deploy  a  fully  interoperable,  nationwide  public 
safety broadband network. Specifically, we have urged the FCC to impose conditions 
on  the  auction  of  10  MHz  of  spectrum  to  ensure  that  the  auction  winner  will  build 
a broadband network serving both the 10 MHz of auctioned spectrum and a portion 
of  the  public  safety  spectrum  (the  12  MHz  currently  allocated  for  data  and  reserve 
channels).  This  ‘‘shared’’  network  would  provide  public  safety  access  to  additional 
spectrum  resources  when  needed,  and  will  also  facilitate  more  efficient  use  of  the 
public safety spectrum. 

Our  support  for  such  a  public-private  partnership  flows  from  our  realization  that 
there is simply no other viable method to pay for a national broadband network that 
will  meet  public  safety  requirements.  Some  local  agencies  may  have  special  access 
to  the  resources  necessary  to  build  a  local  or  regional  public  safety  broadband  net-
work of their own, as is being done here in Washington and in New York City. How-
ever,  most  agencies  around  the  country  will  not  have  similar  funding  available  to 
build their own broadband networks, and there is no way to pool funds beyond state 
or  regional  systems.  The  result  will  be  widely  dispersed  networks  covering  mainly 
resource-rich  jurisdictions,  built  to  different  standards  on  different  portions  of  the 
radio spectrum, and with little or no interoperability. 

A  national  broadband  network,  in  contrast,  could  provide  for  nationwide  inter-
operability,  substantial  cost  efficiencies,  and  more  effective  and  efficient  use  of 
scarce  radio  spectrum.  We  believe  that  such  a  network  can  and  must  be  designed 
to provide these benefits while also accommodating the varying needs and resources 
of  local  agencies.  The  biggest  challenge,  however,  is  to  identify  viable  sources  of 
funding. 

There  are  few  potential  funding  options  for  a  national  public  safety  broadband 
network,  most  of  which  are  simply  unrealistic.  One  option  that  has  been  suggested 
is  for  the  Federal  Government  to  provide  the  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  necessary 
to  build  a  national  network  to  serve  state  and  local  first  responder  agencies.  While 

1 The  current  rules  limit  the  data  channels  to  ‘‘wideband,’’  (i.e.,  channels  of  up  to  150  kHz). 
A pending proposal would allow those data channels and the reserve channels to be consolidated 
to form ‘‘broadband’’ channels (i.e., channels of at least 1.25 MHz). 

2 See  Further  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  in  WT  Docket  Nos.  06–150,  06–169,  96–86,  and 

PS Docket No. 06–229, FCC 07–72 (released Apr. 27, 2007).

we  would  obviously  welcome  such  Federal  funding,  we  know  how  difficult  that 
would be to achieve in the current budgetary environment. Such highly speculative 
and uncertain funding should not deter the FCC from taking advantage of this one- 
time opportunity to address our needs through its auction rules. 

Others  have  suggested  that  public  safety  agencies  simply  rely  upon  commercial 
networks  to  provide  their  broadband  communications  capability.  However,  commer-
cial grade networks are not usually built to public safety specifications. Commercial 
networks will usually focus on densely populated areas, leaving out areas that pub-
lic  safety  agencies  need  to  reach.  Commercial  networks  are  also  typically  designed 
with  higher  potential  outage  rates  than  public  safety  can  usually  tolerate.  Nor  are 
commercial  systems  designed  in  most  cases  to  withstand  natural  disasters  to  the 
same degree as a public safety systems. Public safety agencies also need substantial 
on-demand  access  to  network  capacity  and  user-specific  functionalities  (such  as 
‘‘one-to-one’’ and ‘‘one-to-many’’ communications) that are difficult to meet on a com-
mercial  network.  Moreover,  the  critical  nature  of  public  safety  communications  is 
such that agencies are reluctant to place too much dependence on a commercial en-
terprise that could terminate operations or reduce service quality at any time. 

The  only  viable  option  to  fund  a  national  public  safety  broadband  network  is  to 
form a public-private partnership whereby spectrum resources can be shared among 
commercial  and  public  safety  users,  but  on  a  network  that  meets  the  requirements 
of first responder agencies and retains public safety control over public safety spec-
trum. 

This concept of a public-private partnership was introduced last year in a legisla-
tive proposal from Cyren Call Communications. While we would still welcome legis-
lation to implement some form of that proposal (as it provided for direct public safe-
ty licensing of significant spectrum resources), we are now focusing on more limited 
proposals that are before the FCC and within its authority to implement. 

The  FCC  first  addressed  the  potential  for  a  public-private  partnership  last  year 
in its Ninth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in Docket 96–86 (‘‘9th NPRM’’) in which 
it proposed that a portion of the 700 MHz band spectrum already allocated for pub-
lic safety be assigned to a single national public safety licensee. Until now, all public 
safety radio systems have been built pursuant to licenses issued directly to state or 
local  governments.  The  Commission  explained  in  the  9th  NPRM  that  a  national  li-
censee (which would be a nonprofit entity representing the interests of public safety 
agencies)  would  be  necessary  for  the  successful  development  of  a  national  public 
safety broadband network. 

We  previously  expressed  significant  reservations  about  the  9th  NPRM  proposal. 
While  the  national  licensee  would  have  the  benefit  of  national  spectrum  resources, 
it  would  not  have  access  to  the  initial  funding  necessary  to  deploy  a  national 
broadband network. Unlike traditional public safety licensees at the state and local 
level,  this  national  licensee  would  lack  the  ability  to  raise  funds  through  taxes  or 
municipal  bonds.  Nor  would  the  spectrum  resources  available  to  the  national  li-
censee be sufficient to attract a commercial partner, as the amount of spectrum allo-
cated  for  public  safety  alone  could  not  support  both  public  safety’s  own  needs  and 
a viable commercial network, especially since any commercial use would necessarily 
be subject to ruthless preemption. 

Some  have  suggested  that  the  national  public  safety  licensee  could  simply  issue 
a request for proposals (RFP) seeking a private partner to construct a public safety 
grade  network  on  public  safety  spectrum.  What  happens,  however,  if  nobody  re-
sponds?  In  fact,  that  is  a  likely  result  as  few  commercial  entities  would  have  the 
ability  or  incentive  to  build  a  nationwide  system  with  the  coverage,  reliability, 
functionality  and  security  that  public  safety  requires.  In  any  event,  how  would  the 
national public safety licensee pay for such a network? 

It  was  with  these  fundamental  constraints  in  mind  that  we  have  considered  the 
innovative  ‘‘conditional  auction’’  approach  that  Frontline  Wireless  has  proposed. 
This approach assumes that a block of spectrum will be auctioned with specific con-
ditions,  including  a  requirement  that,  subject  to  a  ‘‘network  sharing  agreement’’ 
with a national public safety licensee, the auction winner will construct a broadband 
network that incorporates the public safety broadband spectrum and is built to sat-
isfy public safety requirements. Through the national public safety licensee, the net-
work will be available for public safety use on a priority basis. While some commer-
cial use of the public safety spectrum may be allowed, it would be on a ‘‘secondary’’ 
basis subject to unconditional preemption. Importantly, the auctioned spectrum will 
also  be  available  for  public  safety  use  when  currently  allocated  public  safety  spec-
trum is insufficient. 

APCO  and  NPSTC  have  filed  comments  with  the  FCC  explaining  their  support 
for  a  conditional  auction  approach,  and  specifying  provisions  necessary  to  ensure 
that  public  safety  remains  firmly  in  control  of  its  own  spectrum.  A  vital  element  of

16 

the  conditional  auction  approach  is  a  network  sharing  agreement  between  the  auc-
tion  winner  and  the  national  public  safety  licensee.  We  have  urged  that  the  agree-
ment  must  be  negotiated  prior  to  the  issuance  of  the  license  to  the  auction  winner, 
and that public safety must not be forced into an unacceptable network sharing with 
a  party  selected  solely  by  auction.  The  agreement  must  also  address  issues  related 
to  the  design  and  functionality  of  the  network,  limitations  on  commercial  access  to 
public  safety  spectrum,  terms  and  conditions  of  public  safety  access  to  commercial 
spectrum,  protections  in  the  event  of  business  failure  by  the  auction  block  licensee, 
and  assurances  that  local  public  safety  agency  variations  can  be  accommodated.  To 
the extent possible, some of these issues should be address in the FCC’s rules. 

Many  national  and  local  public  safety  organizations  and  agencies  have  indicated 
their  support  for  a  conditional  auction  approach  and  a  national  public  safety 
broadband  network.  Some  have  raised  concerns  about  certain  aspects  of  the  pro-
posal, in particular whether local agencies will be able to deploy their own data com-
munications  systems  (there  are  no  changes  proposed  for  the  state/local  licensing  of 
‘‘narrowband’’  voice  systems).  We  share  those  underlying  concerns  and  have  there-
fore recommended a band plan and procedures to protect local autonomy, especially 
for deployment of ‘‘wideband’’ public safety data systems in areas where the national 
broadband network may be slow to deploy. We have also been adamant that public 
safety representatives must have the final word when it comes to the design, deploy-
ment,  and  management  of  the  national  public  safety  broadband  network.  We  have 
no  interest  in  simply  allowing  a  commercial  entity  to  take  over  our  public  safety 
spectrum. 

Finally, because the FCC is necessarily moving at a vigorous pace, we have joined 
with  other  national  public  safety  organizations  to  initiate  the  formation  of  a  legal 
entity  that  could  serve  as  the  national  public  safety  licensee  if  the  FCC  proceeds 
in  that  direction  Our  goal  is  to  ensure  that  the  national  licensee  will  represent  the 
interests of our Nation’s first responder agencies. Thus, the entity now under forma-
tion  is  to  be  a  nonprofit  corporation,  known  as  the  Public  Safety  Spectrum  Trust 
Corporation, and will be led by a board of directors consisting of individuals selected 
by  the  Nation’s  leading  public  safety  organizations,  each  of  which  has  extensive 
knowledge regarding public safety radios systems and spectrum management. There 
would  also  be  an  advisory  committee  consisting  of  a  broad  range  of  organizations 
that also have an interest in the form and direction of a national broadband public 
safety network. Thus, if the FCC adopts a conditional auction process that requires 
a  national  public  safety  licensee,  the  Public  Safety  Spectrum  Trust  Corporation 
would be positioned to serve in that capacity. 

Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, we believe that the FCC should adopt a conditional 
auction  approach  that  requires  the  auction  winner  to  build  a  broadband  network 
that  serves  both  public  safety  and  commercial  users,  and  is  designed,  built,  and 
maintained  to  meet  public  safety  requirements.  I  thank  you  again  for  the  oppor-
tunity to appear before you today. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much.

FRONTLINE WIRELESS, LLC 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Thank you, sir. 
Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  distinguished  mem-
bers  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  address 
the vital issue of public safety communications and how the upcom-
ing spectrum auction can solve this life-threatening problem. 

Thirty years ago, I helped, and was Chief Information Officer for, 
Federal  Express  Corporation  when  we  developed  the  tracking  and 
tracing  system.  It  was  both  a  wireless  and  wireline  system  that 
now reaches around the globe and is the envy of all, and copied by 
all of its competitors, tracking billions of packages a year. As Chief 
Operating  Officer  at  Federal  Express,  I  was  responsible  then  for 
deploying  that  around  the  world,  along  with  many  other  logistical 
networks.

I  then  went  to  McCaw  Cellular,  then  the  largest  independent, 
and  became  the  largest,  cellular  carrier  in  the  world,  where  I  was 
President for 4 years. We sold that to AT&T. 

And  then,  in  the  mid  1990s,  I  went  to  a  little  startup  at  Silicon 
Valley. We called it Netscape. It revolutionized the Internet by cre-
ating  a  browser  that  let  mere  mortals  use  the  Internet,  creating 
the fastest-growing software company in history. We sold that com-
pany in 1999. 

And  then,  later,  as  I  was  trying  to  be  in  retirement,  I  happened 
to  have  been  appointed  by  our  Governor,  Haley  Barbour,  in  Mis-
sissippi,  to  chair  the  Governor’s  Commission  for  Rebuilding  our 
Gulf Coast, where I became reembroiled in this subject of networks 
and how you pay for them. And I’ll get to that. 

As  you  said,  the  Nation  is  coming  to  the  end  of  a  long  road  in 
the transition to digital television. It’s vitally important that we do 
this  correctly.  The  good  news  is  that  now  some  60  MHz  of  that 
spectrum can be used to address the vital needs of our country. 

I’m here today out of frustration and out of hope. The frustration 
comes  from  the  fact  that  6  years  after  9/11,  and  nearly  2  years 
after  Hurricane  Katrina,  we  are  no  closer  to  giving  our  brave  first 
responders  the  basic  communications  tools  they  need  to  save  lives 
and respond to disasters in the vast majority of the United States. 
There  are  certainly  some  exceptions.  One  is  on  the  panel  here 
today, from New York. 

In the wake of Katrina, as I said, honored to serve as Chairman 
of  Governor  Haley  Barbour’s  Commission  on  Recovery,  Rebuilding, 
and  Renewal  in  Mississippi,  I  understood  the  shared  frustration 
among  police  officers,  firefighters,  and  search-and-rescue  teams 
who were forced to use human runners to coordinate an emergency 
response  to  the  largest  natural  disaster  in  our  Nation’s  history. 
This  frustration  runs  deep,  because  it  was  the  same  problem  the 
Nation witnessed in the wake of the 9/11 disaster. 

But  all  problems  bear  the  seeds  of  opportunity  and  hope.  The 
hope  comes  because  we  have  a  tremendous  opportunity  to  solve 
public  safety’s  needs  for  a  truly  interoperable  network.  One  of  the 
key  recommendations  in  my  recovery  report  to  the  Governor  was 
that  Mississippi  needs  to  build  a  statewide  interoperable  wireless 
network funded and developed through public/private partnerships. 
I  would  point  out,  Mississippi  has  now  come  up  with  such  a  net-
work. 

I  went  to  the  State  legislature  for  $250  million  worth  of  bond 
issues.  Didn’t  get  passed.  Marvelous  network.  Didn’t  get  passed. 
Can’t pay for it. These are the same taxpayers, now, who pay Fed-
eral taxes, who pay State taxes, who pay local taxes. Same people. 
Then, when I was introduced to the Frontline plan, which set out 
to  solve  these  problems  in  the  same  fashion  on  a  national  scale, 
joining  as  a  partner  seemed  like  a  no-brainer  to  me.  The  proposal 
put forth by our company would seem to me to culminate a lifetime 
of  work  on  my  part.  Frontline  Wireless  is  to  finance  a  nationwide, 
interoperable  broadband  network  that  does  not  require  legislation, 
does  not  need  a  $30  billion  appropriation,  and  does  not  delay  the 
upcoming auctions. 

After  months  of  careful  planning  with  leaders  of  public  safety,  I 
am  pleased  to  report  that  we  agree  on  many  of  the  essential  fea-

tures  of  a  proposal  to  solve  public  safety’s  needs.  Specifically,  we 
agree  on:  (1)  the  need  for  public/private  partnership;  (2)  the  re-
quirement of additional public safety spectrum during emergencies, 
obviously;  (3)  the  need  for  public  safety  to  have  the  private  sector 
pay  for  the  build-out  of  the  network;  (4)  the  importance  of  public 
safety having a national licensee to coordinate its spectrum; (5) the 
requirement  to  build  a  network  with  unprecedented  coverage,  99 
percent  of  the  U.S.  population—99  percent  of  the  U.S.  population, 
including  Alaska  and  Hawaii;  (6)  the  need  to  protect  public  safety 
in  the  event  of  financial  difficulty;  (7)  the  ability  of  public  safety 
to  have  ultimate  say  over  whether  this  ‘‘E  Block’’  network,  as  it’s 
called,  meets  their  needs;  and  (8)  the  importance  of  all  bidders  to 
understand  that  this  network  needs  to  be  built  to  public  safety 
standards. 

Though  other  issues  remain,  in  my  experience  these  questions 
can, and should, be resolved relatively quickly in further discussion 
between public safety and whoever wins the auction to become the 
‘‘E Block’’ licensee, which certainly may not be Frontline. 

The upcoming 700 MHz auction marks an historic moment. If the 
FCC acts wisely, it can solve public safety’s deadly deficit in inter-
operable  and  broadband  communications.  I’d  like  to  commend 
Chairman Martin, of the FCC, and his fellow FCC Commissioners, 
for  their  remarkable  flexibility  and  foresight  in  allowing  our  pro-
posal to be heard in this late stage of the DTV transition. 

If the FCC adopts the right set of rules, then whichever company 
wins  the  auction,  Frontline  or  someone  else,  the  FCC  can  achieve, 
at  no  cost  to  taxpayers,  the  interoperable  broadband  network  that 
public safety desperately needs. And, I submit to you, will never be 
built  if  we  don’t  do  it  this  way,  because  most  states  and  local  gov-
ernments  will  find  other  things  to  do  with  the  money.  It’s  no  acci-
dent  that  Washington,  D.C.  and  New  York  City  are  the  leaders  in 
building  these  networks.  They’re  the  only  ones  doing  it  right  now. 
They  also  happen,  coincidentally,  to  be  the  two  cities  hit  by  9/11. 
They  fear  the  clear  and  present  danger,  which  is  what  generally 
causes people to get off the tax bases and fund these things. 

The  upcoming  auction  also  has  tremendous  potential  to  foster 
competition and innovation in the broadband and wireless market, 
another  thing  desperately  needed,  as  identified  in  this  morning’s 
Wall  Street  Journal  right-hand  major  piece  on  why  our  current 
wireless system thwarts innovation and other uses for this vital na-
tional asset, why we’re behind the rest of the world in these things. 
The  truth  is  that  the  wireless  industry  is  rapidly  consolidating. 
The  choice  before  the  FCC  is  whether  it  should  take  all  the  spec-
trum  being  freed  up  by  the  DTV  transition  and  hand  it  to  the  in-
cumbents,  who  have  every  incentive  to  simply  warehouse  their 
spectrum,  or  whether  it  should  take  small  part  of  it—we  propose 
just 10 MHz—and use that spectrum to help public safety and also 
create a vitally needed platform for innovation and competition. 

The  Commission  can  go  a  long  way  to  lower  the  significant  bar-
riers  to  competition  and  innovation  in  wireless  communications  by 
designing  the  commercial  side  of  the  shared  ‘‘E  Block’’  network  for 
open  access.  That’s  what  The  Wall  Street  Journal  is  talking  about 
today.  A  shared  network,  the  Frontline  proposal,  would  be  open  to 
all handsets and devices that do no harm to the network, the exact

argument  given  in  the  Carterfone  decision  40  years  ago,  to  any 
kind  of  customer,  from  established  retail  providers  to  startups  to 
device manufacturers to end-users, and to any of the kind of lawful 
content,  whether  streaming  video,  Voice  over  Internet  Protocol,  or 
the  next  big  thing.  The  current  wireless  situation  is  not  good  for 
consumers,  it’s  not  good  for  innovators  or  the  hope  of  creating  a 
third pipe to the home. 

The FCC can adopt a modest proposal, on just 10 MHz, that will 
fundamentally  change  the  current  static  environment  in  which 
America  lags  the  world  on  wireless  development  and  innovation. 
Who benefits from this requirement? The short answer: everybody. 
This  requirement  means  that  regional  and  rural  wireless  carriers 
and  telephone  companies  eager  to  improve  coverage  in  broadband 
for their customers will at last have a nationwide provider. 

In  conclusion,  we  are  long  past  the  time  to  talk  about  what 
might  happen,  or  should  happen,  or  is  going  to  happen  for  public 
safety. Any serious proposal must address how this costly network 
will  be  funded  and  built  without  relying  on  government  funds 
which  are  not  forthcoming,  as  was  the  case  in  Oregon,  just  men-
tioned. 

Frontline’s  plan  is  the  only  proposal  to  provide  a  clear  funding 
mechanism  that  capitalizes  on  this  crucial  opportunity  by  incor-
porating a public/private partnership for public safety into the 700 
MHz auction. 

Thank you all very much, and I’ll look forward to your questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JAMES L. BARKSDALE, PARTNER, 

FRONTLINE WIRELESS, LLC 

I. Introduction and Summary 

Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  and  distinguished  Members  of  the 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to address the vital issue of public safety 
communications  and  how  the  upcoming  radio  spectrum  auction  can  solve  this  life- 
threatening problem. I am a Partner in Frontline Wireless, LLC, which was founded 
by  Haynes  Griffin  (CEO),  Janice  Obuchowski  (Chairman),  and  Reed  Hundt  (Vice 
Chairman). I am pleased that Ram Shriram, who worked with me at Netscape and 
is now on Google’s board, John Doerr, an accomplished Silicon Valley investor whose 
vision helped make companies like Netscape a reality, and Mark Fowler, Chairman 
of  the  FCC  during  the  Reagan  Administration,  also  have  joined  me  as  partners  in 
Frontline.  Together,  we  believe  the  upcoming  700  megahertz  auction  presents  a 
once-in-a-generation  opportunity  for  building  a  nationwide,  interoperable  public 
safety  network  while  also  enhancing  competition  and  innovation  in  wireless 
broadband.  Haynes  Griffin  and  I  were  there  in  the  early  days  of  cellular  and  we 
both  know  how  to  make  wireless  ventures  work.  I’ve  known  former  FCC  Chairman 
Reed  Hundt  for  over  fifteen  years  and  most  recently  co-chaired  with  him  a  study 
group on the future of public broadcasting for PBS. And I’m delighted to be teamed 
up  with  Janice  Obuchowski,  who  has  played  an  important  role  in  tackling  public 
safety’s  needs  as  former  head  of  the  NTIA  and  U.S.  Ambassador  to  the  World 
Radiocommunication Conference. 

We  as  a  Nation  are  coming  to  the  end  of  a  long  road  on  the  transition  to  digital 
television (‘‘DTV’’). This Committee has taken a leadership role in pushing our coun-
try forward to use the precious radio spectrum freed up by the DTV transition more 
efficiently,  and  to  make  that  spectrum  available  for  commercial  and  public  safety 
use.  The  good  news  is  that  now  some  60  megahertz  of  that  spectrum  can  be  used 
to address the vital needs of our country. 

I  am  here  today  out  of  frustration,  and  out  of  hope.  The  frustration  comes  from 
the fact that 6 years after 9/11 and nearly 2 years after Hurricane Katrina, we are 
no  closer  to  giving  our  brave  first  responders  the  basic  communications  tools  they 
need  to  save  lives  and  respond  to  disasters.  In  the  wake  of  Katrina,  I  was  honored 
to serve as Chair of Governor Haley Barbour’s Commission on Recovery, Rebuilding

and Renewal in Mississippi. Through a series of town hall meetings and conferences 
with government officials immediately in the wake of Katrina, our recovery commis-
sion  developed  a  comprehensive  list  of  recommendations  for  rebuilding  the  Gulf 
Coast and better preparing for future hurricanes in that region. My role on the com-
mission exposed me to the shared frustration among police officers, firefighters and 
search and rescue teams who were forced to resort to using human runners in order 
to coordinate an emergency response to the largest natural disaster in our Nation’s 
history.  This  frustration  runs  deep  because  it  was  the  same  problem—the  same 
problem!—that the Nation witnessed in the wake of the 9/11 disaster. 

The  hope  comes  because  we  as  a  Nation  have  a  tremendous  opportunity  to  solve 
public safety’s needs for a truly interoperable network. The hope comes because for 
the  first  time  there  is  a  concrete  proposal  to  finance  a  nationwide,  interoperable, 
broadband  network  that  does  not  require  legislation,  does  not  require  a  $30  billion 
appropriation  from  the  Federal  or  state  government,  and  does  not  delay  the  impor-
tant  700  megahertz  auction.  The  hope  comes  from  the  fact  that  by  working  to-
gether—the public and private sectors—can solve the problem of public safety inter-
operability. 

After  months  of  careful  planning  with  leaders  in  the  public  safety  community,  I 
am  pleased  to  tell  this  Committee  that  while  we  have  not  completely  agreed  on  all 
details  of  how  the  Frontline  wireless  business  can  serve  public  safety,  we  agree  on 
many of the essential features. I want to give you a real time update on what Front-
line  has  discussed  with  representatives  of  the  public  safety  community,  which  is  a 
heterogeneous  group  of  hundreds  of  different  local  and  regional  police,  fire  depart-
ments  and  other  first  responders.  Working  with  their  representatives  and  after 
spending hundreds of hours in meetings all around the country, we have a Plan that 
includes the features most important to that community, namely: 

1. in addition to the 24 megahertz of spectrum already set aside for public safe-
ty,  a  sixth  of  the  spectrum  that  will  be  sold  for  commercial  use  at  auction  will 
be designated as an E Block for both emergency and commercial service; 
2. the E Block will go to the highest bidder for that block of spectrum; 
3.  the  FCC  should  create  a  national  public  safety  licensee  (‘‘NPSL’’)  to  make 
various decisions on behalf of the larger public safety community, including ne-
gotiation  of  a  design  and  spectrum  sharing  agreement  with  the  E  Block  li-
censee; 
4. the license to use the E Block for commercial purposes will carry certain con-
ditions subsequent that must be performed in an orderly fashion, including the 
duty to reach an agreement with the NPSL about the design of the network so 
that it will meet the specifications of the public safety community; 
5.  in  order  to  assure  that  the  private  sector  builds  for  free  a  network  that  can 
serve public safety all across the country, the E Block license will carry the obli-
gation to build a network that covers at least 99 percent of the U.S. population; 
6. public safety will participate in the design and operation of the network that 
will provide service across the E Block and the public safety spectrum; 
7.  local  public  safety  agencies  will  have  the  right  to  build  interim  public  safety 
systems while the national shared network is being constructed; 
8.  only  the  E  Block  licensee  will  have  the  duty  to  negotiate  with  the  NPSL  as 
to the terms discussed above; 
9.  the  NPSL  will  be  free  to  decide  whether  it  wants  to  work  with  the  E  Block 
licensee or seek out a different spectrum licensee or some other firm that lacks 
spectrum; and 
10.  the  network  for  the  public  safety  should  be  interoperable  at  the  choice  of 
public  safety—if  public  safety  users  want  to  connect  to  each  other  through  this 
single  national  network  they  can.  For  example,  if  different  units  need  to  work 
together  to  respond  to  a  crisis  across  jurisdictions,  they  can  use  the  Frontline 
network  to  communicate  vital  information  to  each  other  in  real  time  with  high 
speed connectivity. 

We  have  not  agreed  on  certain  other  provisions.  For  instance,  Frontline  does  not 
believe that the FCC can delegate the selection of the auction winner to an outside 
party,  as  would  happen  if  the  FCC  gave  the  right  to  the  NPSL  to  veto  issuance  of 
the E Block license to the highest bidder in the auction. The E Block licensee should 
be bound by an FCC arbitration of any disputes arising from the negotiation of the 
network sharing agreement, and to charge the arbitrator with the duty to determine 
what  is  commercially  and  technically  reasonable.  While  in  my  experience  all  these 
issues can and should be resolved relatively quickly in the negotiations between the

NPSL and the E Block licensee, the help of this Committee, other Members of Con-
gress  and  the  FCC  may  well  be  helpful  in  achieving  such  resolution.  Furthermore, 
some issues can well be resolved after the Commission reaches its conclusion on the 
service rules later this month. 

Overall, the good news is that Frontline and the public safety community appear 
to have reached a consensus that a public/private partnership should be part of the 
700  megahertz  auction.  We  also  note  with  pleasure  that  the  consensus  is  reflected 
in a recent resolution of the Southern Governors’ Association, which urged the FCC 
to ‘‘apply specific public safety requirements to at least 10 MHz of the spectrum cur-
rently  scheduled  to  be  auctioned.’’  The  State  of  Hawaii  has  perhaps  stated  it  best: 
‘‘the  Frontline  proposal  seems  to  be  an  excellent  compromise  between  various  pro-
posals for Commercial/Public Safety sharing of broadband resources.’’ 

The upcoming 700 megahertz auction marks an historic moment. If the FCC acts 
wisely,  it  can  solve  public  safety’s  deadly  deficit  in  interoperable  and  broadband 
communications. If it adopts the right set of rules, it can achieve, at no cost to tax-
payers,  the  interoperable  broadband  network  that  has  yet  to  be  delivered  after  9/ 
11  and  after  Katrina.  Think  about  it:  fire  fighters  rushing  into  a  burning  building 
could access a video feed of the inside and share that with the rescue squad as they 
plan  how  to  save  lives—without  worrying  if  their  wireless  devices  were  compatible. 
The FCC also can use this historic opportunity to infuse the broadband market with 
a  much-needed  dose  of  competition.  This  hope  of  finally  addressing  public  safety’s 
needs  will  not  be  met,  in  my  opinion,  if  the  FCC  simply  decides  to  turn  this  spec-
trum  over  to  the  national  incumbent  carriers,  who  have  shown  little  desire  to  re-
spond to public safety’s dire needs. 

Working with the public safety community, high-tech companies and public inter-
est  organizations,  Frontline  has  put  before  the  FCC  a  proposal  that  would  require 
the  winner  of  one  slice  of  the  upcoming  700  MHz  auction  to  build  a  network  that 
would  serve  public  safety’s  needs  as  well  as  its  commercial  customers.  If  the  FCC 
adopts this proposal, whichever company—whether Frontline or someone else—wins 
this  spectrum,  it  will  build  for  free  a  nationwide,  interoperable  broadband  network 
designed to serve public safety while covering an unprecedented 99 percent of Amer-
icans. 

The proposal is made economically viable because, outside of critical emergencies, 
the winning bidder of the E Block will be able to make efficient use of unused capac-
ity  on  the  public  safety  spectrum.  But  when  an  emergency  results  in  high-capacity 
demands by public safety officials, they will get immediate access to additional spec-
trum on the commercial system. Before running Netscape, I was President and COO 
of  McCaw  Cellular,  and  built  that  system  into  a  nationwide  network  before  selling 
it  to  AT&T.  I  know  what  it  takes  to  build  and  operate  a  network  that  meets  cus-
tomers’ needs. The Frontline Plan represents the best in public/private partnerships. 
It  uses  the  private  sector  to  solve  a  crucial  public  need  while  generating  the  reve-
nues necessary to attract private capital. 

The 700 MHz auction also has tremendous potential to foster competition and in-
novation in the broadband and wireless market, which is rapidly consolidating. The 
choice before the Commission is whether it should take all the spectrum being freed- 
up by the DTV transition and turn it over to the major incumbents, who have every 
incentive  to  simply  warehouse  their  spectrum;  or  whether  it  should  take  a  small 
part  of  it—we  propose  just  10  MHz—and  use  that  spectrum  to  help  public  safety 
and  create  a  vitally  needed  platform  for  innovation  and  competition.  The  Commis-
sion  can  go  a  long  way  to  lower  the  significant  barriers  to  competition  and  innova-
tion  in  wireless  communications  by  designating  the  commercial  side  of  the  shared 
E  Block  network  for  sale  of  services  to  all  comers  on  what  is  effectively  a  common 
carrier basis. We propose, and have asked the FCC to require, the E Block licensee 
to build a new network with advanced fourth generation capabilities and to sell this 
network capacity on an open basis. To me, ‘‘open’’ means the following: 

viders; 

• open  to  all  customers,  whether  end-users,  device  makers,  or  other  service  pro-
• open to all communications protocols to the degree technically feasible, and with 
our software-defined radio plans Frontline intends to advance the limits of tech-
nical feasibility beyond anything seen to date in America; 
• open  to  all  lawful  content,  meaning  we  will  not  discriminate  against  music  or 
• open to as many combinations of spectrum as are technically and commercially 
reasonable,  meaning  that  our  customers  can  use  Frontline  spectrum  as  well  as 
any spectrum they may own, just as public safety will we hope agree to use its 
spectrum in conjunction with us. 

software just because we do not own or control it;

22 

Although  the  E  Block  represents  only  one-sixth  of  the  spectrum  to  be  auctioned, 
it will create a nationwide broadband license holder fully motivated to sell wireless 
network  services  to,  among  others:  (a)  regional  wireless  providers  until  now  pre-
vented  from  offering  a  nationwide  service,  (b)  rural  wireline  providers  seeking  effi-
cient  ways  to  deliver  to  their  customers  the  same  high-speed  broadband  options 
available  in  urban  and  suburban  communities,  (c)  public  utility  companies  in  need 
of secure and robust wireless communications, (d) companies needing additional ca-
pacity  to  offer  a  ‘‘third  pipe’’  into  the  home,  and  (e)  manufacturers  of  new  mobile 
devices.  This  business  approach  overcomes  the  rational  but  unhealthy  incentive  of 
today’s  vertically  integrated  wireless  incumbents  to  refuse  such  access  whenever  it 
could  compete  with  their  own  (or  their  wireline  affiliates’)  myriad  retail  offerings. 
This  point  is  developed  further  in  the  attached  white  paper  by  our  distinguished 
economists from Stanford University. 

This Committee should encourage the FCC to take the right steps to put America 
on  a  new  path,  one  that  delivers  to  public  safety  an  interoperable  network  and  to 
consumers  multiple  choices  for  broadband  service.  The  large  wireless  incumbents 
with  an  economic  interest  in  the  status  quo  are  loudly  stating  that  public  safety 
‘‘has  enough  spectrum.’’  That  is  not  true.  As  our  experience  during  9/11  and  Hurri-
cane  Katrina  clearly  demonstrated,  public  safety  needs  more  spectrum  in  times  of 
emergencies, and even Sprint Nextel, a national wireless carrier, stated that in tes-
timony  last  month.  I  firmly  agree  with  the  Hawaii  Firefighters  Association,  which 
has supported the essential elements of the Frontline Plan, when they told the Com-
mission that ‘‘[t]hose who would rather keep the entire 700 MHz block for their own 
corporate interests are not focused on doing what is right for public safety.’’ 

It  is  completely  unrealistic  to  expect,  as  the  incumbents  seem  to,  that  public 
money  will  pay  for  a  nationwide  build-out.  Verizon,  for  example,  has  stated  again 
and  again  that  the  ‘‘majority  of  funds’’  for  a  multibillion  dollar  public  safety 
broadband  network—estimated  to  be  in  the  range  of  $15  billion—must  ‘‘come  from 
public sources.’’ That is not going to happen. It did not happen after 9/11, nor after 
Katrina,  and  it  is  not  going  to  happen  now.  You  know  that.  Public  safety  knows 
that. And we know that. 

Even  worse,  Verizon  and  others  who  expect  taxpayers  to  pony  up  for  this  build- 
out  miss  the  key  point  about  taxpayer  funds.  Taxpayers  pay  taxes  locally,  and  to 
their  states  and  at  the  Federal  level.  Wherever  taxed,  they  have  to  support  public 
safety  services.  The  Federal  Government  can  provide  a  great  boon  to  taxpayers  ev-
erywhere  by  requiring  the  E  Block  licensee  to  build-out  for  public  safety’s  benefit 
by  using  its  commercial  business  to  fund  that  network.  Then,  taxpayers  will  know 
that  their  funds  for  public  safety  can  go  to  hiring  more  cops  on  the  beat,  more  fire 
engines, better equipment for first responders, and choice of any devices for first re-
sponders,  because  the  shared  network  will  be  open  to  any  and  all  equipment.  Tax-
payers  will  know  their  money  was  not  wasted,  as  Verizon  suggests,  on  funding  a 
$64  billion  network  that  Frontline  was  willing  to  build  at  no  cost  to  the  taxpayer. 
This  national,  interoperable  network  will  serve  a  diverse  group  of  public  safety 
users,  including  local  fire  and  police  departments,  county  sheriffs,  emergency  man-
agers, highway patrol, and municipalities. After building a new wireless broadband 
network according to specifications agreed upon by the NPSL, the new E Block net-
work  would  be  available  to  each  and  every  public  safety  entity  across  the  country. 
Verizon and AT&T, in contrast, do not propose to build anything new or even nego-
tiate  with  public  safety  about  redesigning  commercial  networks  to  make  them  fea-
sible for public safety use. 

Another  area  of  great  importance  to  public  safety  is  the  scope  of  coverage.  The 
Washington, D.C. area is fortunate enough to be able to afford an interoperable sys-
tem.  The  same  is  true  for  New  York  City  and  parts  of  Mississippi.  But  this  is  a 
big  country,  and  you  well  know  that  those  build-outs  simply  will  not  happen  in  all 
parts  of  West  Virginia  or  South  Carolina  or  Minnesota  or  North  Dakota  or  almost 
any  other  state  in  the  country.  The  large  national  carriers  tell  public  safety  they 
should just rely on the wireless retail carriers’ spotty commercial networks. In fact, 
they  have  not  announced  any  plans  to  use  the  700  MHz  spectrum  to  expand  the 
coverage  or  reliability  of  those  networks  to  serve  public  safety’s  higher  standards. 
Verizon  has  told  the  Commission  that  if  it  adopts  any  coverage  requirements  (and 
Verizon,  of  course,  opposes  any  requirement  to  make  productive  use  of  a  700  MHz 
license), the FCC should let carriers leave 25 percent of the public without coverage. 
Which one-fourth of America would they leave behind? 

We are long past the time to talk about what might happen or should happen for 
public  safety.  Any  serious  proposal  must  address  how  this  costly  network  will  be 
funded  and  built  without  relying  on  government  funds.  Frontline’s  plan  is  the  only 
proposal to provide a clear funding mechanism that capitalizes on this crucial oppor-

tunity  by  incorporating  a  public/private  partnership  for  public  safety  into  the  700 
megahertz auction. 
II. We Must Fix Our Failing Public Safety Communications Systems 

This Committee has rightly recognized that the public safety communications sys-
tems  in  this  country  have  reached  the  point  of  crisis.  As  Chairman  Inouye  recently 
urged,  ‘‘Congress  must  act  quickly  to  give  our  first  responders  the  tools  they  need 
to  effectively  do  their  jobs.’’ 1 Frontline  agrees  with  the  Chairman  that  we  owe  our 
first  responders  nothing  less  than  the  most  modern,  most  reliable,  most  interoper-
able, and most flexible communications system available. 

We have seen the results of communications failures all too clearly, most notably 
on September 11. Thomas Kean, Co-Chair of the 9/11 Commission, has stated blunt-
ly,  ‘‘On  September  11,  people  died  because  police  officers  couldn’t  talk  to  firemen.’’ 
The  9/11  Commission  Report  elaborated,  providing  examples  of  how  the  lack  of 
interoperable  radio  frequencies  between  police  and  fire  department  officials  hin-
dered evacuation efforts: 

At 9:00, the [police department] commanding officer of the World Trade Center 
ordered  an  evacuation  of  all  civilians  in  the  World  Trade  Center  complex.  . . . 
This  order  was  given  over  World  Trade  Center  police  radio  channel  W,  which 
could not be heard by the deputy fire safety director in the South Tower. 

As  we  now  know,  the  South  Tower  collapsed  an  hour  after  this  unheard  evacu-

ation order was issued. 

Four  years  later,  the  failures  of  our  public  safety  communications  networks  were 
again  on  display  during  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita.  Even  though  our  first  re-
sponders once again showed selfless courage and determination, the communications 
systems they relied upon failed both them and the public. It is clear that Vice Chair-
man  Stevens  was  right  when  he  commented  shortly  after  those  disasters  that  they 
‘‘have  shown  that  many  first  responders  just  cannot  talk  with  one  another  because 
their radios and communications networks have been inoperable.’’ 2 An independent 
panel appointed by the FCC also documented some of the more disturbing examples 
of these communications breakdowns: 

[C]ommunications  between  the  military  and  first  responders  also  appeared  to 
suffer  from  lack  of  interoperability.  In  some  cases,  the  military  was  reduced  to 
using human runners to physically carry messages between deployed units and 
first  responders.  In  another  case,  a  military  helicopter  had  to  drop  a  message 
in a bottle to warn first responders about a dangerous gas leak. 

While we have made important progress in some areas, the truth is that our pub-
lic  safety  communications  systems—and  thus  the  American  public—will  remain 
highly  vulnerable  as  long  as  the  networks  continue  to  rely  on  yesterday’s  tech-
nology.  As  the  Washington  State  Council  of  Firefighters  told  the  FCC  earlier  this 
month:  ‘‘We  do  not  have  sufficient  spectrum  and  we  do  not  have  operable  commu-
nications, let alone interoperable communications. As a Nation we have stood by for 
too  long  as  our  communications  system  time  and  again  failed  our  Nation’s  first  re-
sponders.’’  This  is  unacceptable.  The  patience  of  Congress  and  the  American  public 
is wearing thin. The time has come to ensure that the public safety community has 
the  21st  century  communications  systems  it  needs  and  deserves.  This  can  happen 
if the FCC, with encouragement from Congress, designs the upcoming 700 MHz auc-
tion  to  ensure  the  creation  of  a  nationwide,  interoperable  broadband  network,  as 
proposed by Frontline. 
III.  The  Frontline  Plan  Provides  the  Answer—a  Nationwide,  Interoperable 

Network Built and Paid for by a Robust Public-Private Partnership 

Public  safety  officials  have  clearly  stated  what  they  need  to  cure  these  commu-
nications  deficiencies:  a  nationwide,  interoperable  network.  This  type  of  network— 
with  the  reliable,  secure,  diverse  capabilities  it  enables—is  the  single  best  way  to 
improve  and  modernize  public  safety  communications  systems.  For  this  reason,  the 
FCC  recently  designated  half  of  the  public  safety  spectrum  set  aside  by  Congress 
in  the  700  MHz  band  for  broadband  use,  which  is  key  to  IP-based  interoperability. 
Interoperability means that persons from different parts of the public safety commu-
nity  can  talk  or  exchange  information  with  one  another.  But  a  rule  that  the  net-
work, if built, shall be nationwide and interoperable is only the first step. As I said 
at  the  outset,  I  am  pleased  to  report  to  the  Committee  on  the  substantial  areas  of

common  ground  that  we  have  with  public  safety  going  into  the  700  MHz  auction. 
Thus,  the  Frontline  Plan  proposes  service  and  auction  rules  to  ensure  that:  (1)  the 
public/private  partnership  will  construct  the  public  safety  nationwide  network  with 
private  sector  capital,  (2)  the  public  safety  network  will  have  access  to  additional 
spectrum  in  times  of  emergency,  (3)  the  network  will  be  built  to  standards  for  cov-
erage, security and local control that are worked out with public safety, and (4) pub-
lic safety will maintain control over the spectrum allocated to it by Congress. 
A. Funding a Multibillion Dollar Network 

The  reality  public  safety  confronts  is  that  a  nationwide  broadband  network  will 
be  costly  to  construct,  and  the  funds  must  be  generated  up-front.  These  up-front 
costs  could  easily  exceed  $15  billion.  Thus,  while  the  laudable  appropriation  of  $1 
billion  from  auction  proceeds  will  improve  public  safety  communications  for  many 
agencies,  it  cannot  be  relied  upon  to  construct  the  nationwide  network  that  will  be 
key  to  solving  the  interoperability  crisis.  Given  the  obstacles  that  this  Committee 
faced  (and  overcame)  simply  in  making  that  $1  billion  appropriation  a  reality,  it 
would be unrealistic to expect an appropriation of 15 times that amount in the near 
future. Nor should Congress be expected to do so when a public/private partnership 
can deliver the same or better results. 

Accordingly, Frontline’s Plan proposes auction and service rules to ensure that the 
E  Block  licensee  will  fund  the  build-out  of  public  safety’s  nationwide,  interoperable 
broadband  network—built  to  a  public  safety  grade  of  service—at  no  upfront  cost  to 
public  safety  or  taxpayers.  That  is,  the  Frontline  Plan  would  require  the  winning 
bidder  of  the  E  Block,  whoever  that  may  be,  to  build  out  a  network  for  the  public 
safety community and make commercial spectrum available to public safety in times 
of  emergency.  In  return,  the  winning  bidder  would  have  preemptible  access  to  the 
network  capacity  operating  over  the  unused  public  safety  spectrum,  providing  it 
with  additional  revenues  to  recoup  its  investment  in  the  public  safety  network. 
There is nothing novel, let alone problematic, about the Commission’s requiring the 
E  Block  licensee  to  use  the  public’s  spectrum  resource  to  the  public’s  interest.  The 
FCC, as required by Congress, routinely does so for satellite and broadcast licenses. 
Indeed,  Congress  and  the  FCC  have  often  required  private  license  holders  to  assist 
public safety by, for example, imposing emergency warning system requirements on 
broadcasters and 9-1-1 requirements on cellular systems. 

Thus,  Frontline’s  Plan  maximizes  use  of  spectrum  for  public  safety  and  commer-
cial  uses,  makes  available  extra  spectrum  in  emergency  situations,  and  builds  the 
network for free in state-of-the-art, 4G, IP-level configuration. If the FCC takes the 
right  step  and  adopts  the  Frontline  Plan,  it  will  solve  public  safety’s  funding  prob-
lem  by  ensuring  that  the  broadband  network  infrastructure  is  built  with  private 
capital  with  public  safety  only  paying  for  service.  It  will  relieve  public  safety  agen-
cies  of  both  the  construction  costs  and  the  time-consuming  and  difficult  task  of  se-
curing investment. 

Considering the crucial importance of a broadband public safety network and the 
lack of sufficient funding in the public sector, Congress and the FCC must disregard 
calls by the incumbent retail carriers to wait for massive government grants. AT&T, 
for example, argues that because a select few large cities have built broadband net-
works, every other town and county can be left to sink or swim on its own—ignoring 
the  lack  of  sufficient  financial  resources  that  many  communities  face.  As  the  Asso-
ciation  for  Public-Safety  Communications  Officials  (‘‘APCO’’)  explained  in  roundly 
denouncing such hollow arguments: 

APCO  rejects  suggestions  by  some  in  the  wireless  industry  that  public  safety’s 
broadband  needs  can  be  addressed  within  current  public  safety  spectrum  and 
that there is no need for conditional auctions. What these and other parties ig-
nore is that public safety alone cannot afford to build a broadband network. 

In  addition  to  suggesting  that  the  Federal  Government  fund  the  creation  of  the 
public  safety  network,  Verizon  and  AT&T  have  also  advocated  a  ‘‘go  it  alone’’  ap-
proach  for  public  safety  that  relies  upon  a  hope  that  some  retail  party  may  some 
day  decide  to  create  the  network  if  the  price  is  right.  In  other  words,  Verizon  and 
AT&T  would  ‘‘help’’  public  safety  if  the  U.S.  Government  paid  them  $15  billion  to 
do  so.  Congress  and  the  FCC  have  before  them  the  one  and  only  opportunity  to 
bring about a newly built fourth-generation network on spectrum adjacent to public 
safety’s  spectrum.  Relying  on  incumbents  to  use  existing  retail  networks  to  provide 
public  safety  with  the  necessary  services  would  leave  public  safety  with  old  tech-
nology on commercial grade networks. Only a new entrant has the incentive to build 
a  public-safety  grade  network,  and  only  a  new  network  can  offer  these  fourth-gen-
eration services, not only to consumers but also to public safety.

B. Access to Sufficient Spectrum in Times of Emergency 

25 

Public  safety  must  have  access  to  sufficient  spectrum  for  emergency  operations, 
when  a  public  safety  network  is  most  necessary  and  its  communications  resources 
most  tested.  While  Congress  provided  the  foundational  block  of  spectrum  for  public 
safety 10 years ago, the half of that block that can be dedicated to broadband use— 
10  MHz  exclusive  of  guard  bands—is  not  sufficient  to  sustain  a  nationwide 
broadband  network.  As  the  National  Public  Safety  Telecommunications  Council 
(‘‘NPSTC’’)  has  noted,  ‘‘assertions  that  public  safety  has  adequate  spectrum  are  in-
sulated from the reality facing the Nation’s emergency services.’’ 3 The State of Cali-
fornia echoed this finding and stated that it does not believe this to be ‘‘an adequate 
amount of spectrum to handle the expected load.’’ 4 

Frontline’s  Plan  addresses  the  clear  need  for  additional  spectrum  by  more  than 
doubling the amount of peak broadband spectrum capacity available to public safety 
communications  under  emergency  circumstances.  It  does  so  by  requiring  the  adja-
cent,  commercial  E  Block  licensee  to  provide  priority  access  to  public  safety 
broadband  operations  on  its  own  commercial  spectrum  during  emergencies.  Con-
sequently,  under  Frontline’s  Plan,  not  only  would  public  safety  services  have  the 
highest  priority  access  to  network  capacity  operating  on  the  10  MHz  of  broadband 
spectrum  allocated  to  public  safety,  but  when  necessary  it  also  would  have  priority 
access to the E Block’s additional 10 MHz or more of network service capacity. This 
network  capacity  will  save  lives  in  times  of  emergency  by  allowing  police,  fire-
fighters  and  other  public  safety  officials  and  agencies  to  effectively  communicate 
with  one  another  whether  the  interoperable  communication  occurs  within  the  same 
small town or from Hawaii to Massachusetts. 

Although  public  safety  must  have  access  to  far  more  than  10  MHz  during  emer-
gencies,  it  will  not  fully  use  its  own  allocated  spectrum  day-in  and  day-out  and  all 
hours  of  the  day.  Thus,  Frontline’s  Plan  also  makes  the  most  efficient  use  of  spec-
trum  in  non-emergency  times  by  allowing  the  E  Block  commercial  licensee  to  sell 
valuable network capacity over the unused public safety spectrum. As the FCC has 
recognized,  commercial  use  of  public  safety  spectrum  on  a  secondary  basis  is  a  via-
ble  option.  This  secondary  commercial  access  will  in  no  way  disrupt  public  safety 
services,  which  will  always  have  automatic,  instantaneous  and  unquestioned  pri-
ority over commercial users with respect to the full capacity of the 20 MHz or more 
shared  network.  The  beauty  of  an  IP-based  network  is  that  such  prioritization  oc-
curs without ‘‘kicking off’’ the commercial users, as occurs today in the cellular and 
PCS  Wireless  Priority  Service.  Instead,  when  there  is  congestion,  the  public  safety 
traffic  is  prioritized,  and  simply  moves  to  the  head  of  the  line  and  is  delivered  to 
its  destination  prior  to  the  commercial  traffic.  At  its  simplest  level,  this  is  like  an 
emergency  lane  for  a  fire  truck.  Meanwhile,  commercial  traffic  is  not  barred.  It  is 
just  not  given  priority.  Public  safety  emergency  calls  will  always  get  through,  and 
commercial  users  may  have  to  wait  their  turn.  The  same  thing  happens  when  cars 
are obliged to pull over to let an ambulance through on a busy street. 

Notably,  the  parties  that  have  opposed  the  auction  and  service  rules  proposed  by 
Frontline  have  themselves  failed  to  propose  alternatives  for  solving  public  safety’s 
spectrum  shortfall—just  as  they  have  failed  to  address  its  funding  shortfall,  as  de-
scribed  above.  Throughout  the  course  of  this  proceeding,  the  largest  retail  carriers 
have  maintained  that  public  safety  ‘‘has  enough’’  spectrum  and  the  Commission 
should  ignore  public  safety’s  need  for  more.  Indeed,  despite  clear  evidence  to  the 
contrary  that  has  been  presented  by  leaders  in  the  public  safety  community,  as  re-
cently as last week AT&T told the FCC that ‘‘additional spectrum is not needed by 
public  safety  at  this  time.’’  Public  safety  and  Frontline  both  strongly  disagree. 
Frontline’s  Plan  remains  the  only  viable  solution  to  the  capacity  crunch  faced  by 
public safety. 
C. Building to Public Safety Grade Coverage 

The  public  safety  community  has  made  clear  that  a  commercial  grade  network, 
built  merely  to  serve  population  centers  and  immediately  surrounding  areas,  will 
fall  far  short  of  public  safety  standards.  NPSTC  stated  that  ‘‘public  safety  needs  a 
reliable  system  that  has  the  best  possible  coverage.  It  is  not  enough  to  have  cov-
erage  that  merely  mirrors  traditional  cellular  coverage.’’ 5 Based  on  the  needs  ex-

pressed  by  public  safety,  Frontline’s  proposed  rules  would  require  that  the  nation-
wide,  interoperable,  broadband  network  be  built  to  cover  99  percent  of  the  popu-
lation within 10 years, with interim milestones of 75 percent of the population with-
in 4 years and 95 percent within 7 years. Frontline’s proposal for a very high, popu-
lation-based  coverage  requirement  serves  the  essential  goal  of  a  public  safety  net-
work  in  not  merely  reaching  population  centers,  but  also  more  sparsely  populated 
areas. Emergencies can and do occur in outlying towns and rural areas, just as they 
do in urban centers. 

In  contrast,  the  entrenched  retail  carriers,  reflecting  their  equally  entrenched 
business plans that leave little room for innovative public/private partnerships, have 
steadfastly  opposed  any  buildout  requirement  for  the  E  Block  or,  for  that  matter, 
other 700 MHz spectrum. Verizon begrudgingly has stated that if the FCC imposes 
a  buildout  requirement,  there  should  be  a  carveout  of  at  least  twenty-five  percent 
of the population that the licensee could leave completely without service. Such pro-
posals should highlight to this Committee the danger of leaving the future of public 
safety communications in the hands of the retail incumbents. 
D. Preserving Public Safety’s Control Over the Spectrum Allocated to It 

The Frontline Plan also provides for the public safety community’s full and mean-
ingful  participation  in  administering  the  nationwide  shared  public  safety  network 
through the NPSL. Relatedly, it guarantees that public safety will maintain control 
over the spectrum allocated to it by Congress. 

Frontline  strongly  agrees  with  leading  public  safety  advocates  that  the  public 
safety  community  agree  upon  and  publish  a  ‘‘Statement  of  Requirements’’  as  soon 
as  possible,  and  hopefully  within  30  days  after  the  FCC’s  decision  on  the  service 
rules.  This  Statement  of  Requirements  would  spell  out  key  service  requirements 
such  as  performance  objectives  that  would  inform  the  architecture  of  the  shared 
public/private  network  while  leaving  details  such  as  specific  technology  and  service 
decisions  to  a  later  network  sharing  agreement.  Issuance  of  the  Statement  of  Re-
quirements  will  ensure  that  all  bidders  for  the  E  Block  license  will  be  fully  aware 
of public safety’s needs prior to bidding on the spectrum. Frontline has also encour-
aged  the  FCC  to  incorporate  as  many  of  these  requirements  into  the  final  rules  as 
appropriate  with  enough  lead  time  for  bidders  to  take  them  into  account.  This  also 
will  help  to  prevent  disputes  after  the  auction.  Furthermore  the  E  Block  licensee 
should  begin  to  negotiate  the  details  of  the  network  sharing  arrangement  as  soon 
as  the  auction  is  over,  and  aim  to  resolve  that  negotiation  with  the  NPSL  within 
6 months at most. In the unlikely event negotiation was not successful, the E Block 
licensee  would  be  bound  by  an  arbitrator’s  conclusion  as  to  what  is  a  commercially 
and technically reasonable network design. 

The  FCC  will  not  be  able  to  adopt  rules  that  address  all  potential  facets  of  the 
shared  public/private  network  relationship,  since  some  details  will  need  to  be 
worked  out  by  the  NPSL  and  the  winning  E  Block  bidder  after  the  auction  is  con-
cluded. The resulting network sharing agreement will determine the design and fea-
tures of the shared network between the E Block licensee and the NPSL. 
IV. The E Block Network’s Commercial Capacity Should Be Made Available 
to All Carriers and Network Users to Create a Platform for Competition 
and Innovation 

At the same time that it makes Americans safer by improving public safety com-
munications,  the  plan  which  Frontline  and  its  supporters  have  put  before  the  FCC 
will  give  new  and  existing  smaller  wireless  companies  a  future  in  the  increasingly 
consolidated wireless and broadband markets. The telecommunications marketplace 
has shown us that when markets are competitive, American consumers win. But the 
truth is that the wireless industry is not nearly as competitive as it was a few years 
ago, and as a consequence the two largest national carriers are discouraging innova-
tion  by  high-tech  entrepreneurs.  Apple’s  iPhone  is  going  on  sale  later  this  month, 
but if Steve Jobs wanted to reach critical mass of the population he really could only 
call  two  people  to  offer  his  phone,  the  head  of  Verizon  or  the  head  of  AT&T,  which 
control access to more than half of the market. We think that the innovators of new 
devices  should  be  able  to  ask  more  than  two  people  before  launching  an  exciting 
new product. In fact, in an ideal world, they should have to call no one. That is the 
way it has worked on the telephone network for thirty years, and that system works 
well. All we’re saying is that the FCC should dedicate a small part of the spectrum, 
the  E  Block,  for  a  network  to  be  offered  to  all  innovators  and  competitors.  Such  a 
policy ensures that the wireless industry remains entrepreneurial and open to inno-
vation by Silicon Valley and other high-tech companies. It also ensures that compa-
nies  serving  rural  America  will  have  at  last  a  provider  of  network  capacity  eager

27 

and willing to offer service to enable these smaller carriers to offer their customers 
nationwide roaming. 

Verizon and AT&T, as rational incumbents, presumably want to buy the E Block 
and  all  the  other  spectrum  to  be  sold  in  this  last  auction  and  then  warehouse  it. 
While  that  makes  sense  for  them,  it  doesn’t  make  sense  for  public  safety  or  for  the 
American  people.  The  shared  network  that  Frontline  proposes  will  be  open  to  com-
petition and innovation in all the following ways: 

• Open to all handsets and devices that do not harm the network; 
• Open  to  any  kind  of  customer,  from  established  retail  providers  to  startups  to 

device manufacturers to end-users; 

• Open to any kind of lawful content, whether streaming video, VoIP, or the next 

big thing; 

• Open  to  be  used  as  a  complement  to  any  other  network,  regardless  of  commu-
nications protocols to the degree technically and commercially reasonable, espe-
cially including other 700 MHz networks. 

The  benefits  of  such  openness  will  be  many,  but  most  notably  will  come  in:  (a) 
the lowering of barriers to entry in the wireless market; (b) a loosening of the tight 
controls that the wireless incumbents have held over the ability of online innovators 
to  make  new  content  and  services  available  to  consumers  through  wireless  devices; 
and (c) a nationwide roaming provider for regional and rural wireless carriers eager 
to improve coverage for their consumers. 

Lowering  of  Barriers  to  Entry.  The  primary  goal  of  Frontline’s  proposed  commer-
cial service rules is to promote competition by reducing barriers in the wireless mar-
ket.  With  a  facilities-based  provider  open  to  all  kinds  of  customers,  both  new  and 
existing retail providers will be freed from the often prohibitive costs of purchasing 
low-frequency  spectrum  and  constructing  wireless  networks.  As  a  result,  these  pro-
viders—currently  under  intense  pressure  to  offer  their  customers  nationwide  roam-
ing  capability—will  be  able  to  compete  in  their  local  and  regional  markets  against 
the  huge  national  firms  that  have  their  own  national  networks  that  enable  them 
to offer national roaming to all customers at no extra charge. 

It bears mention that Sprint Nextel currently provides roaming and other services 
to  smaller  carriers  and  so-called  ‘‘mobile  virtual  network  operators.’’  But  the  two 
largest carriers insist that they do not want to be obliged to provide roaming in the 
future to small local and regional carriers. And frankly they are entitled not to use 
their  networks  to  enable  their  rivals  to  compete  with  them.  We  understand  that. 
But  precisely  because  that  is  their  economic  incentive,  the  FCC  needs  to  address 
the  problem  of  competition  by  requiring  the  E  Block  licensee  to  sell  service  to  any 
and all buyers. 

Notably,  parties  who  routinely  struggle  with  such  formidable  barriers  of  entry 
have endorsed such openness for the E Block. A group of mid-sized wireline carriers 
consisting of Embarq, CenturyTel, and Citizens/Frontier—which each have a signifi-
cant  presence  in  rural  communities—specifically  described  to  the  Commission  the 
prohibitive costs of network build-out: ‘‘Broadband deployment in rural areas is cost-
ly,  in  significant  measure  because  of  the  challenges  caused  by  low  population  den-
sities,  which  make  it  difficult  to  aggregate  the  customer  demand  needed  to  justify 
large network investments.’’ These companies added that there are no network oper-
ators who simply sell network services and do not choose to compete with their cus-
tomers. 

These  comments  from  mid-size  and  rural  telephone  companies  demonstrate  in 
concrete  detail  how  and  why  a  network  that  offers  service  to  all  parties  can  trans-
late into greater broadband deployment, particularly in rural areas. In these areas, 
it  is  often  economically  irrational  for  providers  to  build  state-of-the-art  wireless 
broadband facilities. (As discussed above, it is this same incentive that makes exist-
ing retail networks poor options for public safety communications.) As a result, rural 
buildout  is  stymied.  Frontline’s  service  proposal  provides  a  way  around  this  eco-
nomic  reality  by  making  rural  wireless  service  cost-effective  for  retail  service  pro-
viders. 

The open service proposed for the E Block would also encourage and rely on mar-
ket-based forces, rather than command-and-control regulation, to meet the concerns 
identified  by  companies  like  Embarq,  CenturyTel,  and  Citizens/Frontier.  Instead  of 
relying on universal service support, Frontline’s Plan addresses the critical problem 
of rural broadband deployment with private sector solutions that do not burden tax-
payers. Further, a requirement that the E Block licensee sell service to anyone, end- 
users or other companies, will create market-based incentives to complement build-
out requirements, which Frontline supports.

Consumer choice. Frontline’s proposed open service rules are also intended to pro-
mote  competition  and  innovation  by  ensuring  that  service  providers  (e.g.,  content 
companies,  applications  providers)  can  freely  offer  new  wireless  services  to  con-
sumers without having to ask permission from Verizon or AT&T. 

Several high-tech innovators have confirmed the need for an open service network 
and  provide  examples  of  the  benefits  that  such  a  network  will  bring  to  them  and 
to  the  state  of  competition  in  the  broader  broadband  market.  Google,  for  instance, 
outlined its critical need for guaranteed access to its customers: 

The  greater  challenge  [Google  faces]  is  . . .  universal  accessibility.  Like  other 
Internet-based  companies,  Google  relies  on  the  communications  infrastructure 
provided  by  underlying  carriers  in  order  to  reach  our  ultimate  end-users.  In 
particular,  in  the  United  States,  the  telephone  companies  and  cable  companies 
control the only means of broadband access to Google’s customers. 

I  already  mentioned  another  example,  Apple’s  iPhone,  which  had  to  go  through 
the  gates  marked  AT&T  or  Verizon  if  it  wanted  to  bring  its  exciting  new  product 
to market. 

Objections to a network that may not act as a gatekeeper between companies and 
consumers  came,  predictably,  from  those  powerful  incumbents  whose  retail  busi-
nesses  have  the  most  to  lose  from  competition  and  innovation.  I  want  to  highlight 
that this is a very modest proposal. We are not proposing to impose this open serv-
ice  requirement  on  all  wireless  providers.  And  we  are  not  proposing  to  impose  this 
requirement  retroactively  on  incumbents.  Rather,  Frontline’s  open  service  proposal 
simply  says  on  a  prospective  basis  that  a  fraction  of  the  700  MHz  spectrum  should 
be  made  available  as  a  platform  for  competition  and  innovation.  We  think  that  is 
a  small  investment  that  will  pay  huge  dividends  for  the  future  of  our  information 
technology economy. 

Roaming. This Committee has long demonstrated leadership in bringing advanced 
telecommunications services to rural Americans, who deserve access to the same ad-
vanced  services  as  their  counterparts  in  urban  centers.  Frontline’s  proposed  open 
service rules will further these goals. By definition, a network making service avail-
able to any buyer will serve as a nationwide roaming provider to regional and rural 
wireless carriers. The emergence of such a roaming provider would encourage wire-
less competition in rural areas by freeing existing competitors from the need to con-
struct  facilities  or  purchase  access  from  entrenched  national  incumbents  who  offer 
competing retail services. 

Comments  filed  with  the  FCC  in  support  of  the  Frontline  Plan  confirm  the  need 
for  competitive  roaming  arrangements.  Cellular  South,  for  example,  describes  both 
the  lack  of  existing  competitive  options  for  mid-sized  carriers  and  its  causes  and 
consequences: 

Frontline’s  proposal  would  provide  a  much-needed  broadband  roaming  partner 
for  small  and  regional  wireless  providers.  Today,  small  and  regional  carriers 
find  it  increasingly  difficult,  if  not  outright  impossible,  to  negotiate  high-speed 
data roaming agreements with national wireless providers. This hurts the small 
carriers but, more importantly, it hurts the rural consumer. 

The  open  service  requirement  will  not  only  help  ensure  widespread  and  robust 
wireless  service  in  rural  areas,  but  will  allow  smaller  and  mid-sized  carriers  to  ‘‘go 
national,’’  and  offer  additional  competitive  choices  to  American  consumers.  Without 
the  ability  to  offer  national  service,  these  carriers  cannot  provide  a  competitive  al-
ternative to larger carriers’ service.

Finally, in terms of who can bid on the E Block and thereby make this open serv-
ice  available  to  the  marketplace,  it  is  important  to  remember  that  when  Congress 
adopted the law creating auctions in 1993, this Committee recognized that it would 
be bad policy if the spectrum simply went to large incumbents that have little incen-
tive to innovate and bring new technologies to market. The Committee required that 
the FCC adopt policies to ensure that small businesses would have a chance to par-
ticipate  in  the  auctions  by  giving  them  bidding  credits  if  they  qualify.  The  FCC  re-
cently adopted rules that say these credits would not be available to an entity that 
leases  or  resells  more  than  fifty  percent  of  its  bare  spectrum  capacity  to  entities. 
The  E  Block  licensee,  however,  will  not  be  leasing  or  reselling  spectrum.  Instead, 
it  will  be  required  to  build  facilities  and  construct  a  national  network  over  which 
it  will  offer  services.  It  will  operate  thousands  of  towers  and  radios  and  utilize  this 
network  as  a  facilities-based  provider.  Because  these  build-out  requirements  will 
apply  to  any  E  Block  licensee  (whether  Frontline  or  anyone  else),  the  leasing  and 
resale restrictions are not relevant and the FCC should so clarify. Moreover, the li-

censee should sell network capacity to anyone including end-users. Under these cir-
cumstances,  an  entity  is  acting  as  a  small  business  and,  if  it  otherwise  qualifies  as 
a  small  business  under  the  FCC’s  rules,  should  get  the  bidding  credit  established 
by Congress. 
V.  The  Frontline  Plan  Ensures  That  the  Commercial  Network  Will  Sustain 

the Public Safety Network 

AT&T  and  Verizon,  in  a  naked  effort  to  keep  the  E  Block  free  of  any  obligation 
to serve public safety, have tried to say that the FCC should not adopt those obliga-
tions  because  the  E  Block  licensee  will  not  succeed  as  a  business.  Well,  making 
money, particularly with a wireless business, happens to be a topic my partners and 
I  know  something  about,  so  I  want  to  offer  a  few  comments.  Of  course,  like  any 
smart  entrepreneur,  we  are  keeping  the  details  of  our  business  model  to  ourselves, 
but  it  has  been  tested  by  sophisticated  investors  and  is  both  viable  and  distinctive. 
The  need  for  confidentiality  is  especially  important  going  into  a  highly  competitive 
auction. And we are working with Citigroup to arrange financing and additional in-
vestment as we look toward the upcoming auction and construction of the network. 
In  general  terms,  I  can  say  that  we  envision  a  wide  range  of  potential  customers 
for  E  Block  network  services.  Of  course,  we  all  know  that  public  safety  and  the  re-
lated critical private sector infrastructure segment is the most important group. But 
there  are  many  others  on  the  commercial  side,  and  in  fact  it  is  these  commercial 
uses  that  make  the  economics  work  for  public  safety.  As  any  Wall  Street  analyst 
or  high-tech  player  can  attest,  mobile  Internet  is  the  next  growth  frontier  in  the 
wireless  industry  and  the  potential  is  simply  enormous.  Just  as  the  Internet  sup-
planted  voice  as  the  growth  engine  in  wireline  telecommunications,  the  same  will 
happen  in  wireless.  At  McCaw  Cellular,  we  recognized  early  on  the  demand  for 
ubiquitous  mobile  communications,  and  we  built  a  multi-billion  dollar  business.  At 
Netscape  we  recognized  early  on  the  power  of  the  Internet  and  we  built  a  multi- 
billion  dollar  business.  Now  I  look  to  the  future  and  see  the  intersection  of  these 
two  markets  and  I  expect  to  be  able  to  build  another  multi-billion  dollar  business. 
The  U.S.  wireless  market  now  has  over  230  million  voice  subscribers,  but  only  a 
small fraction of these have mobile Internet. Over the next decade, many if not most 
(and  perhaps  even  all)  of  the  people  who  now  use  cell  phones  will  come  to  adopt 
mobile Internet. That is a huge, disruptive and exciting market opportunity. 

The  business  opportunity  for  the  E  Block  winner  will  come  from  device  makers 
such  as  Apple  that  want  to  launch  a  new  product.  Imagine  going  on  vacation  and 
using your camera—not a crude camera phone, but an honest-to-goodness camera— 
to  take  pictures  and  immediately  send  them  to  relatives  through  the  air.  You  get 
the picture (so to speak). So it’s easy to see how one could sell network connectivity 
not  only  to  service  providers  but  to  device  makers  as  well.  Google  could  be  a  cus-
tomer,  if  they  want  to  test  a  mobile  broadband  service  in  a  region  of  the  country. 
Demand  could  come  from  a  rural  telephone  company  like  Embarq,  who  wants  to 
offer  broadband  service  in  high-cost  areas,  and  ‘‘triple  play’’  mobility.  It  could  come 
from  Clearwire,  who  hopes  to  be  the  ‘‘third  pipe’’  into  the  home  and  needs  a  com-
plementary coverage network. It could come from smaller wireless carriers, like Mis-
sissippi’s  own  Cellular  South,  eager  to  deliver  customers  a  truly  national  service 
through  roaming  arrangements.  Also,  there  are  large  enterprise  customers  who 
would  like  to  buy  wide  area,  coverage-rich  connectivity.  My  former  company  FedEx 
comes to mind. What if FedEx could track every package in real-time across the en-
tire  United  States?  Not  just  at  hubs  or  transaction  points,  but  everywhere  and  for 
every  package?  Now  extrapolate  to  the  entire  logistics  sector.  This  is  another  big 
opportunity,  and  there  are  many  more  opportunities  out  there  for  a  company,  like 
Frontline,  willing  to  take  advantage  of  them.  Demand  for  this  service  also  could 
come directly from consumers, who do not like the idea of being locked in long-term 
contracts with expensive termination fees. 

In  short,  I  see  this  as  an  exciting  business  opportunity  for  whatever  company 
wins the E Block auction. That is why I think the E Block auction will attract many 
bidders.  It  offers  the  chance  of  becoming  the  wireless  version  of  Level  3,  which  has 
built a strong business offering network capacity to a range of buyers.

The FCC will soon auction what is perhaps the most important piece of spectrum 
ever  allocated  by  Congress,  and  it  is  expected  to  set  the  rules  for  that  auction  in 
the next month. It will be decades before such a large amount of versatile spectrum 
is auctioned again. Thus, it is critical that the FCC use this historic opportunity to 
improve  our  public  safety  communications  systems  and  promote  competition  within 
the  market.  In  my  opinion,  it  would  be  a  mistake  to  construct  an  auction  that  will 
solely  serve  the  interests  of  the  dominant  national  carriers.  When  the  next  emer-

gency  strikes,  our  communications  systems  must  be  a  tool  that  saves  lives  rather 
than a source of confusion and tragedy. 

This Committee has overcome multiple obstacles over the past decade to bring the 
DTV  transition  to  a  successful  conclusion  so  that  our  Nation’s  first  responders  can 
make urgent changes to the way they communicate. Now, all that remains between 
success and failure are a few, critical last steps which the FCC must take to finish 
the  job.  To  make  sure  that  happens,  I  respectfully  urge  the  members  of  this  Com-
mittee  make  clear  their  expectation  that  the  FCC  adopt  the  following  elements  for 
the upcoming 700 MHz auction: 

• Meet  the  urgent  need  for  a  nationwide,  public  safety  wireless  broadband  net-
work  by  providing  that  the  E  Block  licensee  must  construct  that  network  and 
design it to public safety grade specifications. 
• Meet the needs of rural wireline carriers, smaller wireless companies and online 
entrepreneurs  to  access  low-frequency  networks  by  requiring  the  E  Block  li-
censee  to  offer  network  services  to  commercial  customers,  including  by  offering 
roaming to requesting carriers. 
• Promote  competition  and  innovation  by  ensuring  that  the  E  Block’s  network 
service  is  offered  without  unreasonable  discrimination  against  particular  types 
of services, applications, and content. 
• Clarify  that  the  Designated  Entity  restrictions  on  lease  or  resale  of  raw  spec-
trum  do  not  apply  to  the  potential  E  Block  licensee  given  that  it  is  required  to 
construct its own facilities and offer services upon them. 

In these first years of the 21st Century, you and I have too many times seen the 
devastating effects of communications failures. Given the stakes involved, I and my 
partners at Frontline hope this Committee will urge the Commission take the steps 
necessary  to  make  this  Committee’s  vision  for  public  safety  communications  a  re-
ality. I thank you again for the opportunity to be here today. 

Economic Comments on the Design of the 700 MHz Spectrum Auction 

Peter Cramton, Andrzej Skrzypacz, and Robert Wilson 1 

11 June 2007 

1 Introduction 

Our previous submission in response to the Report and Order and Further Notice 
of  Proposed  Rule  Making  (FCC  07–72,  27  April  2007)  presented  economic  analysis 
that supports Frontline’s proposal that a national license for the E Block of the 700 
MHz band should mandate open access. Open access means that 

1. wholesale contracting is transparent and nondiscriminatory, and 
2. there is neither exclusion nor discrimination among devices and communica-
tions that conform to the licensee’s published standards and operating protocols. 
The  motivation  is  straightforward.  Extending  to  the  wireless  sphere  the  huge 
gains  to  communication  and  commerce  of  the  wireline  Internet  will  greatly  benefit 
the American public. The creation of the Wireless Internet requires an open network 
comparable  to  the  wireline  network  that  has  made  the  Internet  so  beneficial.  The 
700  MHz  auction  is  the  Commission’s  main  opportunity  to  give  the  public  the  full 
benefits of wireless services from competitive providers of digital telephony, Internet 
connections, and broadband. 

This paper extends the economic analysis by addressing claims from opponents of 
this  open  access  proposal.  We  argue  that  the  current  state  of  the  wireless  market, 
and  the  potential  for  improving  consumer  welfare,  justify  the  following  conclusions: 
• Open  access  for  the  E  Block  is  necessary  and  will  improve  the  efficiency  of  the 
auction  outcome.  Further,  it  is  essential  to  address  open  access  in  this  pro-
ceeding. The open-access and wholesale provisions for the E Block are narrowly- 
tailored remedies and fully consistent with the Commission’s goals. 
• There  is  an  important  market  failure  in  auctions  with  dominant  incumbents. 
Auction rules that level the playing field between incumbents and new entrants 
are  necessary  to  assure  efficient  assignment  of  the  licenses.  In  particular,  the

previous  AWS  auction  of  high-frequency  spectrum  was  not  comparable  to  the 
upcoming 700 MHz auction of low-frequency spectrum. If the AWS auction rules 
are used for the 700 MHz auction then incumbents can block entry and consoli-
date their dominant positions. 

In  the  next  section  we  justify  these  conclusions  in  the  context  of  our  replies  to 

others’ comments. 
2 Responses to Open Access Opponents’ Claims 

This  section  explains  why  the  points  listed  in  the  Introduction  are  true,  contrary 
to claims made by some opponents of the open access proposal. It also explains why 
opposition serves the narrow interests of incumbents rather than the public welfare. 
2.1 The  open-access  requirement  on  the  E  Block  is  necessary  to  obtain  an  efficient 

auction outcome 

As we explained in detail in our previous comments, the wireless market is highly 
concentrated and on a path toward even greater concentration that could eventually 
justify  antitrust  actions.  Indeed,  the  concentration  level  is  well  above  levels  that 
normally  trigger  antitrust  scrutiny  in  merger  situations  were  it  not  for  the  FCC’s 
pre-emption  of  regulation  in  communication  industries.  Such  concentration  can 
harm  consumers  in  general,  and  it  is  especially  noxious  when  incumbent  firms  can 
stifle  innovative  entry  straightforwardly  in  auctions  conducted  by  the  FCC.  Their 
exclusions of roaming and selected devices and communications could be interpreted 
as vertical foreclosure. 

Two  firms,  Verizon  and  AT&T,  now  control  much  of  the  access  to  the  low-fre-
quency  spectrum  in  the  800  MHz  range.  Low-frequency  spectrum  is  necessary  for 
low-cost nationwide coverage and robust service. It allows these two firms to charge 
higher  prices  and  yet  have  lower  churn  rates  and  a  higher  share  of  new  subscrip-
tions.  The  financial  interests  of  these  two  companies  are  to  exclude  access  by  any 
provider  of  retail  wireless  services  that  might  capture  market  share  by  competing 
against their own retail arms and dependent affiliates. 

The Wireless Internet can be a source of great benefits to customers. It will great-
ly  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  markets  for  communications  services,  which  is  the 
most  important  policy  goal  of  the  Commission.  The  benefits  are  likely  to  accrue 
mostly  to  consumers  and  reduce  incumbents’  profits.  Therefore,  the  Commission 
cannot  realistically  hope  that  any  incumbent  will  create  the  Wireless  Internet  on 
its own initiative. Hence the Commission must act in the interest of the consumers 
to  designate  the  E  Block  for  open  access  and  to  sell  the  right  to  build  and  operate 
it to the highest bidder. 

Consumer welfare has been enhanced by the introduction and expansion of mobile 
wireless  services.  But  the  absolute  level  of  consumers’  gain  is  not  the  appropriate 
metric—instead  it  should  be  measured  against  the  gain  in  consumer  welfare  that 
is  possible.  The  introduction  of  additional  competition—competition  engendered  by 
an  open  access  E  block—can  accelerate  and  magnify  the  gains  in  consumer  welfare 
from  wireless  services.  It  is  this  opportunity  that  the  Commission  risks  missing 
were it to allow the incumbents to forestall entry in the 700 MHz auction. 
2.2 There  is  an  important  market  failure  in  spectrum  auctions  with  dominant  in-

cumbents 

Some  opponents  of  open  access  argue  that  selling  a  license  with  no  restrictions 
to  the  highest  bidder  should  result  in  the  most  efficient  assignment  of  the  spec-
trum.2 Subject to various qualifiers, this view can sometimes be a valid guide when 
all  potential  bidders  are  on  equal  footing.  But  it  is  severely  wrong  when  some  bid-
ders  are  new  entrants  and  some  are  incumbents  motivated  to  protect  their  market 
shares. 

The  reason  is  that  entrants  and  incumbents  have  very  different  motives.  A  new 
entrant’s incentive is to maximize its profits from the license alone, while an incum-
bent  maximizes  the  sum  of  its  profits  from  the  combination  of  its  existing  licenses 
and  new  licenses.  When  its  existing  profits  would  be  threatened  by  a  new  entrant, 
an  incumbent  is  willing  to  pay  more  for  a  new  license  to  prevent  competition  than 
any entrant would pay for the license. 

• To  gain  market  share,  an  entrant  prices  services  on  its  newly  acquired  spec-
trum  to  undercut  the  incumbents’  prices.  Customers  benefit  from  this  down-
ward  pressure  on  prices  due  to  increased  competition.  To  gain  further  market

32 

share,  a  new  entrant  also  wants  to  offer  technical  innovations  valued  by  cus-
tomers. 
• In  contrast,  an  incumbent  realizes  that  any  competing  service  offered  on  the 
new spectrum steals business from its existing retail service plans. Hence it has 
muted incentives to offer lower prices or new technologies that compete with its 
existing  offerings.  To  prevent  losing  business  to  new  competitors  and  being 
forced  to  reduce  prices,  an  incumbent  is  willing  to  pay  a  premium  to  acquire 
the  spectrum—and  the  larger  its  current  market  share,  the  larger  is  the  pre-
mium it is willing to pay. It is crucial to realize that under these circumstances, 
even  though  an  incumbent  values  winning  the  license  more  than  an  entrant 
does,  that  additional  valuation  does  not  represent  true  value  added,  but  rather 
the incremental value of thwarting competition from entrants. 

This is why allowing bidders with large market shares to compete on equal terms 
with entrants yields an allocation that is distorted away from an efficient allocation. 
Equal  competition  among  unequal  bidders  is  biased  toward  those  with  market 
shares to protect. The resulting allocation is inefficient in that it displaces entrants 
who  could  otherwise  have  invigorated  competition  and  thus  lowered  prices  to  con-
sumers. 
2.3 Auction rules that level the field between incumbents and new entrants are nec-

essary to assure the most efficient assignment of licenses 

To  enable  an  efficient  assignment  of  the  new  spectrum,  the  Commission  cannot 
take a hands-off approach to the design of the service and auction rules. In the early 
spectrum  auctions  a  spectrum  cap  prevented  each  cellular  duopolist  from  obtaining 
additional  licenses  in  its  cellular  regions.  Comparable  intervention  is  needed  now 
to prevent the current low-frequency carriers from capturing the 700 MHz spectrum 
to  solidify  their  dominant  positions.  Because  the  spectrum  cap  that  the  FCC  estab-
lished before the PCS auctions was removed, the chief remaining instruments avail-
able  now  focus  on  exclusion  of  the  800  MHz  licensees  and/or  bidding  credits  for 
small  businesses.  Measures  of  this  kind  are  necessary  lest  the  800  MHz  duopoly  is 
extended to the 700 MHz spectrum to fully and permanently consolidate their domi-
nance.  By  enabling  entrants  to  compete  effectively  in  the  auction,  bidding  credits 
for  small  businesses  encourage  an  assignment  of  the  licenses  that  is  more  efficient 
and ultimately more beneficial to consumers. 

This conclusion accords with the argument for restrictions on the E Block license. 
Nondiscriminatory wholesale contracts for open access to the E Block licensee’s net-
work  level  the  field  for  regional  licensees  and  retailers  who  compete  in  retail  mar-
kets with the retail arms of the incumbents’ nationwide vertically integrated propri-
etary networks. 
2.4 It  is  important  to  create  the  Wireless  Internet  now,  not  in  separate  proceedings 

after the auction 

Some parties want the open access and Carterfone issues to be addressed in other 
proceedings,  and  thus  they  argue  that  Commission  should  not  address  them  sepa-
rately for this auction.3 We disagree: it is essential to address open access and other 
provisions of the E Block license in this proceeding. 

The  Commission  cannot  readily  impose  open  access  on  selected  licenses  after  the 
license  assignment  and  the  licenses’  prices  have  been  previously  determined  by  an 
auction  process  conducted  without  the  bidders’  knowing  the  service  rules  that  will 
ultimately  prevail.  A  decision  before  the  auction  allows  the  two  business  models 
(open-access  and  proprietary  vertically  integrated  networks)  to  compete  in  the  auc-
tion  and  subsequently  to  co-exist  and  compete  for  customers.  It  is  better  policy  to 
establish  the  licenses’  specifications  before  the  auction,  to  allow  firms  competing  in 
the auction to assess their valuations without uncertainty about the future outcomes 
of additional proceedings. 
2.5 The AWS auction is not an appropriate analogy for the upcoming 700 MHz auc-

tion, and it did not perform as well as some commenters argue 

Dr.  Hazlett  in  his  paper  ‘‘Competition,  Auction  Receipts  and  Economic  Welfare’’ 
submitted on behalf of Verizon in response to the Notice states that the recent AWS 
auction attracted competitive bidding and no anticompetitive behavior by the incum-
bents.  His  supposition  that  there  is  an  analogy  between  the  AWS  auction  and  the 
700 MHz auction is incorrect. The AWS auction allocated very different spectrum— 
high-frequency spectrum that is not economical for development of a robust nation-
wide network that could compete with the coverage of existing networks in the 800

MHz  band.  The  AWS  auction  did  not  allow  any  entrant  to  challenge  the  position 
of  AT&T  and  Verizon  as  the  two  leading  firms  with  the  requisite  low-frequency 
spectrum  that  is  necessary  for  developing  nationwide  products.  Nor  did  it  create  a 
major  threat  to  the  duopoly  rents  that  they  earn  from  their  exclusive  holds  on  li-
censes for low-frequency spectrum. 

The situation is very different in the upcoming auction of 700 MHz spectrum. The 
700 MHz auction is not ‘‘just another auction’’. It will assign spectrum with physical 
properties greatly superior to the PCS and AWS spectrum, and indeed, directly com-
parable  to  the  incumbents’  800  MHz  spectrum.  The  700  MHz  auction  is  a  unique 
opportunity  to  prevent  entrenchment  of  the  dominant  positions  of  the  current  in-
cumbents. The FCC should ensure that new entrants have a chance to pursue their 
business  plans  and  that  the  ‘‘incumbent  bias’’  of  auctions  described  in  Section  2.2 
does not yield an inefficient allocation of this precious spectrum. 

Moreover,  the  view  that  the  AWS  auction  was  a  boon  for  competition  is  not  cor-
rect. In reality, the participation of one new entrant with a nationwide strategy was 
hampered  by  the  auction  rules.  The  DBS  bidders  dropped  out  of  the  auction  when 
the  total  of  the  prices  for  nationwide  coverage  by  aggregating  smaller  blocks  was 
evidently well below their willingness to pay. We say this based on the DBS bidders’ 
actual  bids  for  large  regional  licenses,  which  might  also  have  reflected  discounts 
from  their  willingness  to  pay  for  nationwide  coverage  because  of  exposure  risk  (as 
we explained in our previous filing). It is impossible to say whether the DBS bidders 
would  have  been  successful  with  different  auction  rules,  but  one  can  say  that  the 
AWS auction rules frustrated the participation of this potential nationwide entrant. 
Given  that  vastly  more  is  at  stake  for  AT&T  and  Verizon  in  the  auction  of  the 
700 MHz spectrum, it is clear that if the Commission does not level the playing field 
then these two firms will have both incentive and ability to discourage new competi-
tion in wireless markets at the national level. 
2.6 The open access provisions for the E Block are narrowly tailored remedies, fully 

consistent with the Commission’s goals 

Some  parties  before  the  Commission  argue  that  the  open-access  provisions  are 
heavy-handed regulation and contrary to the Commission’s goals. We disagree with 
both parts of this statement. Rather than being heavy-handed, the proposal asks for 
a  modest  restriction  on  a  single  10  MHz  block  out  of  the  78  MHz  of  spectrum  li-
censed  for  commercial  use  in  the  700  MHz  band  and  no  restrictions  on  the  other 
low-frequency  CMRS  spectrum.  This  restriction  is  no  more  than  minimally  nec-
essary  to  assure  open  access  on  nondiscriminatory  terms.  Without  it  America  will 
likely never see open access. 

Any  decision  the  Commission  makes  about  the  service  and  auction  rules  is  ulti-
mately  a  decision  about  the  structure  of  the  market  for  decades  to  come.  Extreme 
concentration of the low-frequency spectrum in the hands of two firms sets the stage 
for continued domination by these two companies, unless the FCC takes action now. 
Imposing  modest  restrictions  on  the  E  Block  license  is  much  less  intrusive  than 
the two main alternatives: (a) endorsing continued domination of the low-frequency 
spectrum  by  Verizon  and  AT&T’s  vertically  integrated  proprietary  networks,  or  (b) 
requiring open access on all spectrum by requiring mandatory roaming at regulated 
rates.  The  provisions  of  the  E  Block  license  are  confined  to  the  minimal  require-
ments for open access on nondiscriminatory terms. This is the least intrusive of the 
ways  the  Commission  can  establish  an  infrastructure  for  wireless  communication 
that  is  not  controlled  and  manipulated  by  firms  with  a  chokehold  on  nearly  every 
aspect of America’s digital technology. 

The  Commission’s  goal  is  to  allocate  spectrum,  a  very  scarce  and  valuable  re-
source, to its highest and best use as measured by the public welfare. This outcome 
will  not  be  achieved  by  selling  the  700  MHz  spectrum  without  restrictions  to  the 
800  MHz  incumbents,  whose  high  valuations  stem  from  their  incentives  to  protect 
their current profits by stifling competition rather than creating value added for the 
public. 

Lastly, we add that the effect on the Treasury’s revenue of the E Block provisions 
is  much  less  than  the  incumbents  argue  in  their  comments,  and  under  some  sce-
narios  may  generate  higher  bids.  Establishment  of  the  Wireless  Internet  will  make 
all  the  regional  licenses  more  valuable  and  hence  it  will  increase  the  revenue  from 
auctioning  other  blocks.  Further,  if  the  Commission  chooses  to  take  no  action  and 
adopts  rules  that  perpetuate  the  incumbents’  dominant  positions,  then  the  auction 
will likely be over before it starts—if potential bidders expect the incumbents to win 
then  there  will  be  little  competition  and  low  revenue  for  the  Treasury.  Evidence 
from  many  European  countries  has  shown  clearly  that  auction  prices  were  much 
lower  when  incumbents  could  acquire  all  3G  licenses  than  when  the  auction  rules

guaranteed a level field for new entry.4 Given the dramatic evidence from Europe’s 
sad experience, there is no excuse for repeating such a mistake in the upcoming auc-
tion of 700 MHz spectrum. Importantly, similar rules worked well in some countries’ 
auctions and terribly in others’ auctions—what did matter was the incumbents’ abil-
ity  in  the  auction  to  dwarf  competition  from  potential  entrants.  The  erroneous  ex-
pectation that the same rules—closely comparable to those for the FCC’s auction of 
PCS spectrum—will work well for many different auctions with differing competitive 
environments, was a major mistake in the designs used in Europe. In several coun-
tries  the  unexpectedly  small  revenues  brought  dismay  at  the  relevant  Treasury  de-
partments. 
3 Conclusion 

We  see  the  Commission  having  three  main  alternatives:  (a)  do  nothing  and  thus 
continue the dominance of the vertically integrated incumbents, (b) enforce open ac-
cess  on  all  spectrum  by  imposing  service  rules  requiring  nondiscriminatory  terms 
for roaming on all spectrum, or (c) establish an open-access license on a slice of the 
700  MHz  spectrum  to  create  room  for  both  business  structures  to  co-exist  and  to 
compete for customers on price, quality and variety. 

We stress that the last alternative is available only now, in the band plan, service 
rules, and auction design for the licenses to be sold in the upcoming auction of 700 
MHz  spectrum.  It  is  also  the  propitious  moment  for  extending  to  wireless  services 
the advantages of the Internet. We believe that the dire situation implied by (a) and 
the heavy-handed intervention implied by (b) can be avoided with minimal interven-
tion by the Commission. Applying pro-competitive open access rules to just a single 
slice of the 700 MHz spectrum leaves most of the spectrum available for other busi-
ness plans. The E Block license provides the Nation a minimal public infrastructure 
for wireless communication, one comparable to the wireline Internet that has yield-
ed vast benefits. 

If  an  open  access  license  is  not  created  then  thereafter  the  FCC  will  be  limited 
to  forcing  selected  license  owners  to  open  access  to  retail  entry.  Doubtlessly  the 
vertically integrated networks will offer solutions for many retail customers, but we 
emphasize that competition from new retail providers using the open access network 
will force incumbents to improve their services and lower prices. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Mr. Barksdale.

STATEMENT  OF  PHILIP  J.  WEISER,  PROFESSOR  OF  LAW  AND 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS,  EXECUTIVE  DIRECTOR,  SILICON 
FLATIRONS PROGRAM, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO 
Mr.  WEISER.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Ste-
vens,  members  of  this  distinguished  Committee.  I  appreciate  the 
opportunity  to  testify  here  on  a  very  important  public  policy  issue, 
which is, how can this upcoming auction help facilitate the develop-
ment of advanced technologies for use by public safety? 

My approach to this issue comes from my standpoint as Professor 
of  Law  and  Telecommunications  at  the  University  of  Colorado, 
where I also serve as the Executive Director of the Silicon Flatirons 
Program. 

More particularly, over the last year I’ve focused on this issue in-
tensely, working on a report for the Aspen Institute, writing an ar-
ticle  for  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  Law  Journal, 
and,  most  recently,  convening  a  roundtable  supported  by  CTIA, 
which published a report on this topic. 

Today,  I  testify  on  my  own  behalf,  and  the  views  are  only  mine. 

And I’m not here affiliated with any other entity. 

I want to underscore three basic points in my oral remarks today 
that are elaborated in my testimony, the only one, you’ll note, with 
footnotes today, as appropriate for a professor.

The main points I want to emphasize are the following: 
One is, there’s an emerging new policy strategy that is far better 
than  anything  that  has  been  done  with  public  safety  communica-
tions to date. 

Number two is, the lynchpin of this strategy is the idea of a pub-
lic safety spectrum licensee, which can be very effective, with some 
safeguards that I’ll note. 

And,  number  three,  we  should  all  appreciate  how  difficult  the 
transition  will  be  from  the  old  model  of  public  safety  communica-
tions to a new one. 

So, let me quickly underscore this first point. 
There  was  an  old  model,  where  public  safety  agencies  managed 
their  own  networks.  They  operated  networks  on  a  local  level,  buy-
ing  highly  specialized  and  expensive  equipment  to  do  so.  The  re-
sult,  as  has  been  emphasized  quite  a  bit  by  members  of  this  Com-
mittee,  was  non-interoperable  and  generally  antiquated  equipment 
used by public safety that is inferior to that available through com-
mercial providers. Moreover, because public safety communications 
systems  often  are  intermittent  in  their  use—sometimes  they’re 
used  intensely,  and  other  times  not  at  all—spectrum  often  went 
underutilized. 

In short, this old model left the agencies using antiquated equip-
ment.  It  was  difficult  to  facilitate  interoperability,  and  it  was  at 
odds  with  spurring  next-generation  technologies.  This  new  model, 
which  can  be  facilitated  by  this  upcoming  auction  and  related  pol-
icy  initiatives,  would  allow  public  safety  agencies  to  get  cutting- 
edge technology and equipment that is as powerful as used by com-
mercial  sectors  and  the  military.  This  new  model  will  enable  this 
new network to be adapted and to meet the requirements of public 
safety. 

So,  rather  than  have  spectrum  dedicated  only  to  public  safety, 
public  safety  agencies  can  embrace  an  opportunity  to  share  spec-
trum  with  a  commercial  partner,  thereby  enabling  greater  effi-
ciencies and the buildout of a next-generation network. 

To  spur  this  network,  as  I’ve  mentioned,  the  FCC  has  wisely  in-
troduced—and  I  commend  its  leadership  on  this—the  concept  of  a 
public  safety  spectrum  licensee,  which  would  control  12  MHz  of 
spectrum that could be used to develop this new advanced network. 
This  policy  innovation  can  bring  great  benefits  to  the  public,  to 
public  safety,  as  long  as  the  licensee  can  negotiate  an  effective 
framework with a commercial partner. 

And for this framework to be effective, it has to be able to adapt 
to  changing  circumstances  as  new  requirements  emerge,  and  it 
needs  qualified  advisors  to  help  it  come  up  with  a  framework  that 
can  protect  its  prerogatives  and  ensure  that  the  partner  follows 
through on its promises. 

Finally, I want to emphasize that, even with the right framework 
in place, this transition to a new technological architecture is going 
to be difficult. As Senator Sununu mentioned, this culture of public 
safety  communications  as  operating  a  silo  is  deeply  ingrained,  and 
it’s  very  important  to  bring  local  public  safety  agencies  onboard 
with  this  new  transition,  where  they’ll  operate  virtual  private  net-
works along the lines of those used by corporate America.

In any event, the development and deployment of a next-genera-
tion  network  has  to  happen  at  higher  levels.  It’s  not  going  to  hap-
pen effectively locally, and it’s not going to happen if local agencies 
are  unable  to  break  out  of  the  cultural  mindset  where  they  need 
to  operate  their  own  networks.  Rather  than  operating  and  control-
ling their own networks, they need to become smart users of them. 
I  know  this  is  not  going  to  happen  overnight.  It’s  going  to  take 
a  lot  of  political  leadership,  continued  attention  from  this  Com-
mittee  and  the  FCC,  and  I  commend  you  all  on  this  important 
work. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PHILIP J. WEISER, PROFESSOR OF LAW AND TELECOMMUNI-
CATIONS,  EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR,  SILICON FLATIRONS PROGRAM,  UNIVERSITY OF 
COLORADO 

I. Introduction 

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Stevens,  and  Members  of  this  Committee  for 
the  opportunity  to  testify  on  the  important  public  policy  challenge  of  ensuring  that 
the  upcoming  700  MHz  auction  and  related  policy  initiatives  facilitate  the  develop-
ment  and  deployment  of  advanced  communications  technologies  for  use  by  public 
safety  agencies.  I  approach  this  issue  from  the  standpoint  of  my  position  as  a  Pro-
fessor  of  Law  and  Telecommunications  at  the  University  of  Colorado,  where  I  also 
serve as the Executive Director of the Silicon Flatirons Program. More particularly, 
my  testimony  reflects  my  intense  research  focus  on  this  issue  over  the  past  year, 
during  which  I  authored  a  report  for  the  Aspen  Institute,  wrote  an  article  recently 
published  in  the  Federal  Communications  Law  Journal,  and  co-authored  a  report 
informed  by  a  roundtable  recently  sponsored  by  CTIA—The  Wireless  Association.1 
My  testimony  today,  however,  reflects  solely  my  own  views  and  any  recommenda-
tions  I  offer  should  not  be  ascribed  to  any  of  the  entities  I  have  worked  with  on 
this issue. 

In  my  remarks  today,  I  will  focus  on  four  themes  that  merit  particular  attention 
as this Committee and the Federal Communications Commission wrap up their im-
portant  work  related  to  public  safety  communications  and  the  upcoming  700  MHz 
auction.  First,  I  will  discuss  the  need  for  a  national  public  safety  entity  to  manage 
a block of spectrum (i.e., ‘‘a public safety spectrum licensee’’) to promote the rollout 
of  a  wireless  broadband  network  to  support  the  use  of  advanced  information  and 
communications  technologies  by  public  safety.  Second,  I  will  address  the  concept  of 
a  shared  public  safety/commercial  wireless  network,  explaining  the  powerful  logic 
behind  this  proposal  both  with  regard  to  enabling  public  safety  agencies  to  use  ad-
vanced  technologies  and  in  promoting  spectral  efficiency.  Third,  I  will  discuss  the 
issues  of  governance  and  enforcement  that  must  be  addressed  in  order  to  make  a 
public safety spectrum licensee model a success. Fourth, I will emphasize the impor-
tance  of  moving  forward  quickly  with  the  auction,  managing  expectations,  sup-
porting  ongoing  innovation  in  this  area,  and  not  letting  the  perfect  be  the  enemy 
of the good. In short, promoting the development and widespread deployment of an 
advanced communications infrastructure for use by public safety is critically impor-
tant, difficult, and likely to take some time. Before I develop these themes, however, 
I will begin by detailing some important background information.

II. Background 

For  many  years,  the  development  of  communications  infrastructure  for  public 
safety agencies remained largely an afterthought in telecommunications policy. This 
reflected  the  conventional  wisdom  that  local  public  safety  agencies  should  be  as-
signed specific blocks of spectrum and use that spectrum to operate their own wire-
less  telecommunications  networks.  This  policy  was  arguably  a  sensible  one  when 
public safety agencies were among the relatively few established entities that oper-
ated  wireless  networks.  Over  the  last  several  years,  however,  two  distinct  concerns 
have  arisen  as  to  the  state  of  public  safety  communications:  (1)  different  agencies 
cannot  communicate  with  one  another  using  their  legacy  equipment;  and  (2)  ad-
vanced  communications  technologies  increasingly  being  offered  by  commercial  wire-
less  providers  are  not  available  to  public  safety  agencies.  I  will  address  each  point 
in turn. 
A. The Traditional Interoperability Concern 

The  concerns  related  to  the  inability  of  public  safety  agencies  to  communicate 
with  one  another  reflects  the  continuing  lack  of  interoperability  between  many  leg-
acy  public  safety  radio  systems.  In  general,  legacy  radio  systems  are  engineered  to 
meet  specific  requirements  articulated  by  public  safety  agencies—such  as  a  very 
quick call setup time to enable communication during ‘‘shoot-don’t shoot’’ situations, 
effective talk group functionality, and ‘‘talk-around’’ capability. Radio systems man-
ufactured to meet these specifications, however, are produced solely for public safety 
agencies,  often  rely  on  proprietary  technology,  and  are  generally  quite  expensive. 
Consequently,  if  one  public  safety  agency  adopts  a  particular  system  and  another 
public  safety  agency  adopts  a  different  system,  there  often  is  no  easy  way  for  the 
two  systems  to  communicate  with  one  another.  As  you  all  appreciate,  this  lack  of 
interoperability  can  be  at  best  challenging  (by  making  communication  between  dif-
ferent  first  responders  difficult  or  impossible)  or  at  worst  tragic  (as  in  the  case  of 
9/11  when  lives  were  lost  because  messages  were  not  relayed  between  different 
agencies). 

The often touted solution for addressing the lack of interoperability between pub-
lic safety radio systems is that all public safety agencies should purchase new equip-
ment  that  can  enable  them  to  talk  to  one  another.  Under  this  strategy,  local  agen-
cies would all purchase new equipment and operate that equipment using the same 
spectrum  bands.  Indeed,  the  Project  25  initiative  rests  on  this  vision,  as  it  aimed 
to  develop  an  open  standard  for  digital  trunked  radio  systems  that  would  enable 
agencies to cooperate with one another, share spectrum between them, and, ideally, 
enjoy interoperable communications across jurisdictions. As a recent GAO report de-
tailed, however, the Project 25 initiative has failed to deliver on its promise, largely 
because  the  relevant  standards  never  facilitated  a  more  competitive  market  in 
equipment.2 Stated simply, ‘‘the Project 25 [initiative] made the mistake of treating 
public  safety  communications  as  a  distinct  island,  giving  rise  to  proprietary  tech-
nologies  that  are  not  compatible  with  commercially  developed  (and  far  cheaper)  al-
ternatives.’’ 3 Finally,  Project  25  radios  are  designed  to  support  narrowband  voice 
communications,  but  not  broadband  communications  that  can  enable  public  safety 
agencies to gain access to useful information and communicate more effectively. 

A  second  interoperability  solution  is  the  use  of  gateways  that  use  Internet  Pro-
tocol technology to connect otherwise incompatible systems. Such gateway solutions 
are  considerably  cheaper  than  purchasing  new  Project  25  radios  for  a  particular 
area,  but  they  do  not  necessarily  enable  as  effective  or  efficient  communications  as 
direct  radio  connections.  Nonetheless,  as  a  cost  effective  method  of  enabling  dif-
ferent agencies to communicate at all (which is often what is needed), such solutions 
are quite promising and continue to improve in terms of their level of functionality. 
A  third  interoperability  solution  is  for  agencies  to  adopt  new  wireless  broadband 
systems that enable them to use Internet-based communications (such as Voice over 
Internet  Protocol)  that  can  communicate  directly  to  other  agencies  equipped  with 
broadband  systems  or  indirectly  through  gateways  solutions  (such  as  those  de-
scribed above). Unlike the Project 25 model, the purchase of wireless broadband sys-
tems is relatively inexpensive (as they rely on commercially marketed products) and 
can  support  an  array  of  applications  other  than  voice  communications.  Like  the 
gateway  solution,  however,  the  use  of  interoperability  at  the  Internet  layer—i.e., 
Voice  over  IP  connections—does  not  provide  the  same  level  of  operability  (at  least 
using today’s technology) as traditional dispatch systems. But again, in many situa-

tions, such as the often cited failings at the Columbine tragedy, 9/11, and the after-
math  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  the  critical  problem  was  an  inability  to  communicate 
at  all,  not  an  inability  to  communicate  at  the  required  call  setup  times  that  public 
safety agencies sometimes need. 

The case for promoting wireless broadband and advanced information and commu-
nications  technologies  is  not  merely  that  it  constitutes  a  potential  interoperability 
solution.  Rather,  such  technologies  can  enable  public  safety  agencies  to  operate 
more  efficiently  and  effectively.  Indeed,  such  technologies  are  increasingly  a  source 
of important efficiencies in the hands of corporate America and the military—think 
of  how  FedEx  tracks  packages  or  how  Walmart  tracks  its  inventory—and  there  is 
every reason to believe that advanced information and communications technologies 
can  empower  public  safety  agencies  in  numerous  ways.  The  challenge,  however,  is 
to  develop  a  policy  strategy  to  promote  the  development  of  a  next-generation  net-
work for public safety agencies. 

Before  I  discuss  the  opportunities  created  by  and  the  strategy  necessary  to  de-
velop  next  generation  networks  for  public  safety,  let  me  emphasize  two  sobering 
points about the above discussion. First, it is important to appreciate that the need 
for  short  term  interoperability  solutions—such  as  the  gateway  model—will  not  dis-
appear once we embark on the road toward a next generation network. Second, the 
next  generation  network  will  not,  at  least  in  the  reasonably  near  term,  function  as 
a  replacement  for  the  traditional  public  safety  dispatch  systems.  Rather,  over  at 
least  the  next  decade  (while  a  next  generation  network  is  developed,  deployed,  and 
proven  out  as  sufficient  to  meet  the  requirements  of  public  safety),  it  is  likely  that 
public  safety  agencies  will  need  to  support  both  their  traditional  dispatch  systems 
and  a  next  generation  system.  Among  other  things,  this  means  that  the  funding 
needs  of  public  safety  agencies  with  respect  to  information  and  communications 
technologies are likely to increase in the near term. 
B. A Next-Generation Network Architecture 

During  my  initial  exposure  to  the  issue  of  how  to  develop  a  next  generation  net-
work  for  public  safety,  the  conventional  wisdom  was  that  public  safety  agencies 
would  never  face  up  to  a  challenging  cultural  shift  as  to  how  public  safety  commu-
nications should operate. In particular, the prevailing wisdom was that public safety 
agencies  would  always  insist  on  operating  their  own  networks  and  would  never  ac-
cept an architecture that would call for the sharing of spectrum between public safe-
ty  and  commercial  services.  In  my  experience,  however,  a  number  of  public  safety 
officials  have  led  the  way  in  embracing  the  logic  behind  the  move  to  a  new  techno-
logical  architecture  and  a  new  policy  strategy  to  deliver  next  generation  network 
services  to  public  safety  agencies.  For  that  progressive  vision,  I  applaud  their  lead-
ership and willingness to break from the old model. 

The  increasing  interest  in  a  policy  strategy  to  promote  next  generation  networks 
for public safety reflects the realization that broadband networks are critical to the 
future  of  public  safety  communications  and  the  services  now  available  to  corporate 
America  should  be  adapted  to  meet  their  needs.  As  one  public  safety  official  put  it, 
‘‘[n]ew  public  safety  applications  and  capabilities  involving  broadband  communica-
tions,  IP  technologies  and  flexible  radios  and  spectrum  sharing  opportunities  with 
commercial providers where appropriate are all in public safety’s future.’’ 4 The pub-
lic policy challenge is how to facilitate the emergence of this future. 

To  spur  the  development  of  broadband  networks,  it  is  reasonably  clear  that  the 
old model of networks operated and used solely by public safety agencies themselves 
is inefficient and unsustainable. That model, which was borne of necessity in an era 
where  there  were  no  suitable  commercial  wireless  services,  ignores  a  powerful  case 
for  using  spectrum  more  efficiently.  After  all,  public  safety  agencies  use  spectrum 
intensely  at  particular  moments,  but  often  use  their  spectrum  on  a  limited  basis. 
Consequently, the ability to share spectrum between a public safety entity and other 
customers can ensure that the network and spectrum is used more efficiently. 

On a practical level, it makes sense to develop and operate broadband infrastruc-
ture  for  public  safety  in  concert  with  other  providers.  After  all,  we  do  not  expect 
public safety agencies to manufacture their own uniforms or cars. As with uniforms 
and  cars,  it  is  not  difficult  to  develop  next  generation  technologies  that  can  be 
adapted to the needs of public safety. The advantage of relying on commercial tech-
nologies is that public safety agencies will be able to benefit from commercial econo-
mies  of  scale  and  purchase  equipment  far  more  economically  than  they  have  been 
able  to  with  respect  to  their  traditional  dispatch  networks.  Consider,  for  example, 
that ‘‘a cell phone with voice, video, and data capability costs about seven times less

than  a  public  safety  digital  portable  radio  that  cannot  even  take  a  digital  photo, 
much less send it to another person.’’ 5 

The  bottom  line  in  terms  of  the  policy  strategy  for  next  generation  networks  for 
public  safety  is  that  the  traditional  approach  for  supporting  public  safety  commu-
nications  will  not  work  effectively.  Consequently,  policymakers  need  to  appreciate 
that  our  Nation’s  effort  to  develop  next  generation  networks  for  public  safety  agen-
cies  will  turn  on  our  ability  to  spur  a  new  model  of  governance,  new  cultural 
mindsets  amongst  the  relevant  stakeholders,  and  new  funding  models  to  support  a 
new  technological  architecture.  As  I  will  emphasize  in  closing,  these  are  difficult 
transitions  and  policymakers  should  both  be  vigilant  in  prodding  them  forward  as 
well as understanding that they will not take place overnight. 
III. The Importance of a National Public Safety Spectrum Licensee 

The  Federal  Communications  Commission  initially  assumed  that  the  traditional 
policy  model  would  govern  the  use  of  the  700  MHz  spectrum  dedicated  to  public 
safety.  In  particular,  the  vision  animating  early  discussions  of  how  the  spectrum 
would be used assumed that agencies would purchase new systems, such as Project 
25  radios,  and  operate  them  at  the  same  frequencies.  Over  the  last  several  years, 
however,  it  has  become  clear  that  this  solution  is  neither  cost  effective  nor  would 
it  enable  public  safety  agencies  to  use  advanced  broadband  technologies.  Indeed, 
this model is often associated with the ‘‘narrowbanding’’ concept that is antithetical 
to the development of broadband networks. 

Over the last year, the Federal Communications Commission has moved in a new 
direction. This new direction has made the Commission’s work on the relevant rules 
for the soon-to-be assigned spectrum far more challenging, but I applaud Chairman 
Martin and his fellow Commissioners for their leadership on this issue. If, for exam-
ple,  the  Commission  carved  up  the  entire  24  MHz  of  spectrum  devoted  to  public 
safety  into  narrowband  channels  and  distributed  them  to  local  agencies,  it  would 
have  undermined  the  ability  to  use  this  spectrum  for  broadband.  Instead  of  fol-
lowing  the  old  model,  however,  the  Commission  created  a  new  one.  In  particular, 
it  proposed  the  creation  of  a  public  safety  spectrum  licensee  that  would  receive  a 
nationwide  12  MHz  license  and  use  it  to  spearhead  the  development  and  deploy-
ment  of  a  broadband  network  (or  network  of  networks)  to  be  used  by  public  safety. 
The model of a national public safety spectrum licensee is one that poses a num-
ber of risks, but I believe that these risks can be managed. Moreover, I believe that 
the principle that networks should be operated at higher levels than local agencies— 
i.e.,  regional  or  state—is  essential  to  enabling  next  generation  networks  to  be  de-
ployed.  In  other  words,  the  development  of  regional  and  national  cellular  networks 
is  not  an  accident;  there  are  real  economies  of  scale  in  deploying  such  networks  at 
higher  levels.  For  both  cost  purposes  and  expertise  purposes,  the  development  of 
next generation networks by a public safety spectrum licensee is a considerably bet-
ter bet than expecting localities to do so themselves. 

The  national  public  safety  spectrum  licensee  would  enjoy  several  important  ad-
vantages not available to local agencies who have traditionally managed public safe-
ty’s  communications  systems.  In  particular,  this  licensee  would  be  uniquely  posi-
tioned both to develop a more attractive bargain for public safety (by purchasing in 
bulk  and  using  its  assembled  expertise)  and  could  ensure  a  level  of  consistency  as 
to  the  technology  adopted  by  public  safety.  Today,  for  example,  early  next  genera-
tion  public  safety  systems  being  developed  in  New  York  and  Washington  use  dif-
ferent  technologies  and  different  bands  of  spectrum,  meaning  that  a  radio  devised 
for the New York City system will not operate in Washington. By contrast, a public 
safety spectrum licensee would be in a position—presumably in concert with a com-
mercial operator—to develop a standardized air interface (or a relatively economical 
commitment to a multi-mode device) that would afford public safety agencies a simi-
lar  mobility  with  their  devices  to  that  enjoyed  by  customers  of  commercial  wireless 
firms. 

One of the principal risks of a national public safety spectrum licensee is that this 
entity will be insufficiently attentive to the needs of local public safety agencies and 
will  attempt  to  craft  a  ‘‘one  size  fits  all’’  solution.  To  guard  against  this  risk,  local-
ities should be afforded an effective voice as to what kind of offering should be avail-
able  to  them.  (An  alternative  safeguard  is  that  local  public  safety  agencies  would 
be  able  to  receive  Federal  grant  money  and  not  use  the  offering  sponsored  by  the 
national public safety spectrum licensee provided that they demonstrated that they 
were adopting another effective interoperability solution.) Finally, state, regional, or 
local planning efforts will be critical to developing the appropriate rules for how dif-
ferent agencies receive priority to the network in different scenarios.

Fortunately,  the  nature  of  Internet  Protocol-supported  applications  are  that  they 
can easily be adapted to deliver different functionalities and to empower local agen-
cies to operate their own virtual private networks—even if local agencies do not con-
trol  the  physical  infrastructure.  In  fact,  that  is  exactly  the  model  used  by  almost 
every major American enterprise company. Ideally, leadership at the state level will 
emerge (and be encouraged to emerge by Federal policy 6) to spearhead the develop-
ment  of  these  networks,  public  safety-centric  applications,  and  wired  Internet  Pro-
tocol  backbones  that  can  interface  with  other  critical  systems  (such  as  E-911  serv-
ices,  electric  utility  information,  and  public  health  information).  To  date,  however, 
such state leadership is the exception, not the rule. 7 
IV. The Shared Public Safety/Commercial Wireless Network Concept 

The creation of a national public safety spectrum licensee is the essential starting 
point  for  the  development  of  an  effective  next  generation  network.  The  FCC’s  pro-
posal  to  create  such  a  licensee  is  thus  an  important  start  for  ensuring  the  develop-
ment  and  deployment  of  a  next  generation  network.  The  next  question  is  whether 
that is the only necessary step. As I will explain, I believe that the Federal Govern-
ment  will  either  need  to  provide  significant  funding  to  subsidize  the  development 
of this network directly or, as a second best option, enable spectrum to be monetized 
as  an  asset  to  support  the  network  development  and  deployment.  Let  me  be  clear 
at  the  outset—I  would  prefer  to  see  government  fund  the  development  of  such  net-
works  directly,  but  in  the  absence  of  this  development,  the  other  model  may  well 
be  a  second  best  strategy.  Indeed,  in  the  ideal  world,  such  funding  might  come 
through  a  reform  of  the  Federal  Government’s  own  wireless  network  project  (the 
IWN  initiative),  which  is  estimated  to  run  between  $5  billion  to  $10  billion  and  to 
only serve a limited number of Federal agencies.8 

In  its  proposal  for  a  public  safety  spectrum  licensee,  the  FCC  states  that  the  12 
MHz to be licensed to the public safety spectrum licensee can be leased to commer-
cial users when not being used by public safety (on a preemptible basis). This policy 
innovation—and it is a progressive step away from the silo-mentality that often has 
characterized  spectrum  policy—offers  the  licensee  a  revenue  source  to  support  the 
development  of  a  next  generation  network.  Moreover,  Frontline  has  suggested  that 
this  policy  be  supplemented  with  a  further  encumbered  10  MHz  band  of  spectrum 
that  would  be  auctioned  to  an  entity  willing  to  develop  a  next  generation  network 
that  would  be  used  by  public  safety  (as  well  as  others).  In  principle,  the  encum-
bering  of  spectrum  with  a  requirement  to  serve  public  safety  would  depress  the 
price  of  the  relevant  spectrum  and  thereby  constitute  an  indirect  subsidy  to  public 
safety. 

In  developing  its  proposal,  Frontline  has  suggested  that  an  open  access  require-
ment  should  be  coupled  with  a  commitment  to  serve  public  safety.  The  theory  be-
hind  this  proposal  appears  to  be  that  the  current  wireless  operators  are  insuffi-
ciently  motivated  to  support  a  variety  of  applications  and  equipment  developers, 
thereby  stifling  innovation.9 If  this  suggestion  is  indeed  valid,  policymakers  should 
be concerned about a lack of competition in the wireless industry. After all, competi-
tion is the most powerful and effective facilitator of innovation; that is, even in the 
best  of  worlds,  regulatory  responses  are  only  a  second  best  strategy.  To  that  end, 
I  am  very  sympathetic  to  the  goal  of  attracting  new  entrants  (particularly  wireless 
broadband  providers)  via  this  auction  and  believe  the  rules  for  the  auction  should 
be  hospitable  to  them.  But  the  proposal  to  attach  an  open  access  mandate  to  spec-
trum encumbered with a requirement to serve public safety seems to me like a mis-

6 To  date,  Federal  policy  has  not  always  effectively  encouraged  strategic  leadership  at  the 
state  level.  See  U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office,  First  Responders:  Much  Work  Remains 
to Improve Communications Interoperability 20–21(Apr. 2007), available at http://www.gao.gov/ 
new.items/d07301.pdf  21  (‘‘[A]lthough  DHS  has  required  states  to  implement  statewide  plans 
by the end of 2007, no process has been established for ensuring that states’ grant requests are 
consistent with their statewide plans’’). 

7 The  Aspen  Institute  report,  see  note  1,  supra,  discusses  the  importance  of  such  leadership. 
And,  in  a  promising  development,  the  Southern  Governors  Association  is  investigating  a  strat-
egy  for  providing  such  leadership  on  a  regional  basis.  See  http://www.southerngovernors.org/ 
resolutions/Interoperability.html.

9 To put the issue in terms of economic analysis, it boils down to whether the incumbent plat-
form  providers  view  applications  developers  hospitably  (i.e.,  because  they  make  their  platform 
more valuable) or as a threat (for any number of possible reasons). For a comprehensive discus-
sion  on  how  information  platform  providers  view  applications  developers,  see  Joseph  Farrell  &

fit as it would limit the number of eligible bidders, potentially compromising on the 
goal of finding the best possible partner for public safety. 

As  I  emphasized  above,  the  relevant  question  is  how  much  money  public  safety 
will be given directly to support the development of next generation networks. With 
enough  money,  public  safety  agencies  can  lease  spectrum  in  the  marketplace  and 
build  a  next  generation  network—as  is  currently  happening  in  New  York  City. 
Without  a  commitment  of  serious  resources,  however,  the  encumbered  spectrum 
model  becomes  a  possible  second  best  strategy.  I  am  not  opposed  to  this  strategy 
and  appreciate  that  in  the  current  environment,  it  might  be  the  best  opportunity 
available and a risk worth taking. But if the FCC decides to take this risk, I believe 
it needs to implement a series of measures to enhance its chances of success. 
V.  The  Public  Safety  Spectrum  Licensee  and  the  Importance  of  Effective 

Governance 

The  public  safety  spectrum  licensee  concept,  whether  or  not  coupled  with  encum-
bered  spectrum  such  as  that  proposed  by  Frontline,  must  be  implemented  with  a 
number  of  safeguards  to  ensure  that  it  will  be  able  to  deliver  on  its  promise.  The 
first, and in some ways the most critical, challenge is to ensure that the public safe-
ty spectrum licensee is assisted by able and independent advisors so that it can ne-
gotiate  effectively  as  to  how  the  12  MHz  of  spectrum  will  be  used  and  how  a  next 
generation  network  system  will  be  developed  and  deployed.  There  are  a  number  of 
important details that will need to be hammered out and, just like corporate Amer-
ica  relies  on  specialized  consultants  to  craft  contracts  related  to  their  information 
and  communications  technology  needs,  public  safety  will  similarly  need  the  aid  of 
highly qualified advisors. Thus, I would emphasize the importance of hiring of quali-
fied consultants to aid the public safety spectrum licensee in its series of important 
decisions. 

The  second  principal  strategy  related  to  the  public  safety  spectrum  licensee  con-
cept  is  that  this  entity  must  be  held  accountable  for  its  decisions  and  the  FCC  will 
need  to  exercise  its  oversight  of  the  relevant  licensee  to  ensure  that  it  is  operating 
responsibly.  Notably,  the  FCC’s  oversight  should  not  entail  second  guessing  of  that 
licensee’s  decisions  or  invite  appellate  review  of  them.  It  should,  however,  stand 
ready to investigate any concerns that the licensee is abusing its authority. 

The final two strategies related to ensuring an effective public safety spectrum li-
censee function address directly the challenges that emerge from the proposal to en-
cumber  10  MHz  of  spectrum  with  a  requirement  to  serve  public  safety.  Again, 
whether or not the Frontline proposal is adopted, it is both likely and desirable that 
public  safety  cooperate  with  commercial  firms  to  develop  a  joint  public  safety-com-
mercial  network.  In  principle,  this  network  would  both  meet  the  requirements  of 
public safety (to the extent reasonably practicable) and enjoy the economies of scale 
that emerge from a shared network that relies on commercially produced equipment 
(as  opposed  to  equipment  specially  produced  for  public  safety).  In  short,  the  Front-
line  proposal  raises  two  wrinkles  that  require  special  attention:  (1)  public  safety 
agencies  must  be  afforded  with  the  right  to  walk  away  from  the  proposed  partner-
ship; and (2) the FCC must ensure that some level of enforcement be self-executing 
(say, binding arbitration) in the event that the winner of an auction for encumbered 
spectrum failed to follow through on its commitments. 

As I noted above, a proposal like the Frontline model reflects a second best strat-
egy  in  the  absence  of  an  available  revenue  source  to  support  the  development  and 
deployment of a next generation network for public safety. Significantly, the Front-
line  proposal  is  not  premised  on  any  need  by  public  safety  agencies  to  gain  access 
to  more  spectrum  to  deploy  such  a  network.  Indeed,  without  any  additional  spec-
trum  assignment  at  all,  the  City  of  New  York  is  contracting  for  the  development 
and  deployment  of  a  next  generation  network.  But  the  City  of  New  York  is  able  to 
contract  for  that  network  because  it  possesses  the  necessary  financial  resources  to 
do  so.  Thus,  unless  there  is  a  more  robust  funding  commitment  from  the  Federal 
Government,  the  option  of  using  encumbered  spectrum  becomes  a  plausible  second 
best strategy. 

The  advantage  of  simply  endowing  the  public  safety  spectrum  licensee  with  a 
funding  commitment  is  that  this  model  makes  clear  that  they  are  in  the  driver’s 
seat  when  it  comes  to  negotiating  the  relevant  contractual  terms.  In  the  case  of  an 
encumbered spectrum solution, the nature of the negotiation becomes more complex 
and, in the worst possible case, it might represent a ‘‘forced marriage’’ whereby the 
public safety spectrum licensee is, in effect, coerced to deal (and share its spectrum) 
with an entity that it views as either unqualified or untrustworthy to deliver on its 
promises.  To  avoid  this  scenario,  the  public  safety  spectrum  licensee  must  be  in  a 
position  to  walk  away  from  any  possible  deal  with  the  winner  of  an  auction  for  en-
cumbered spectrum. Moreover, if the public safety spectrum licensee did walk away 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 02, 2012 Jkt 074104 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74104.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

42 

from  such  a  partnership  for  ‘‘reasonable  grounds,’’  the  winner  of  the  encumbered 
spectrum would necessarily be judged unable to deliver on its commitment to facili-
tate  the  development  of  a  next  generation  network  for  public  safety.10 Going  for-
ward, it will be important that the public safety spectrum licensee and its commer-
cial  partner  develop  strategies  for  instituting  new  requirements  to  meet  the  needs 
of  public  safety  and  ensure  that  the  commercial  partner  is  not  able  to  take  advan-
tage of public safety—i.e., in effect becoming an unregulated monopoly.11 

The  second  important  safeguard  that  should  accompany  the  award  of  a  spectrum 
license with a commitment to provide a next generation network to public safety is 
that  there  must  be  real  and  self-executing  enforcement  mechanisms.  The  history  of 
spectrum  policy  is  littered  with  the  commitments  of  spectrum  licensees  who  made, 
and have failed to keep, any number of assorted commitments. As noted above (and 
as  I  have  argued  elsewhere 12),  the  use  of  a  spectrum  license  to  generate  public  in-
terest benefits is suboptimal to using direct fiscal support to achieve those benefits. 
But  the  fact  that  this  approach  has  failed  elsewhere  does  not  mean  it  is  destined 
to  failure  here—only  that  regulators  should  approach  any  regulatory  bargain  with 
their  eyes  open  and  a  well  devised  strategy  to  hold  a  licensee  to  its  commitments. 
In  terms  of  the  relevant  commitments  that  a  licensee  should  be  forced  to  make, 
I  am  aware  that  overly  onerous  commitments  could  backfire  insofar  as  they  might 
undermine  the  ability  of  the  licensee  to  attract  sufficient  funding  via  the  capital 
markets.  This  concern,  however,  only  means  that  the  relevant  performance  bond, 
lien  on  the  spectrum,  or  lien  on  the  infrastructure  should  be  triggered  with  suffi-
cient sensitivity so that public safety does not possess an ability to pull out the rug 
from  the  licensee  unfairly.  Again,  the  historical  concern  tends  to  argue  that  the 
more realistic scenario would be an overly forgiving posture toward a failure to per-
form  rather  than  an  overly  harsh  judgment  as  to  whether  a  licensee  had  actually 
performed.  In  short,  an  appropriately  balanced  enforcement  mechanism  should  be 
clear, provide fair warning, be self-executing (i.e., not require a lengthy proceeding), 
and provide significant consequences so as to ensure effective performance. 
VI. The Importance of Ongoing Innovation and Responsible Leadership 

Before I conclude, I must emphasize that the current focus on the upcoming auc-
tion  and  the  proposals  now  taking  center  stage  should  be  kept  in  appropriate  per-
spective.  In  particular,  the  current  700  MHz  auction  is  not  the  last  opportunity  to 
facilitate  improvements  in  public  safety  communications.  Rather,  it  is  merely  one 
important  chapter  in  an  ongoing  effort  to  improve  the  use  of  information  and  com-
munications technology by public safety. 

As I have discussed above, a next generation network offers enormous opportuni-
ties for public safety agencies to operate more efficiently. Indeed, if the public safety 
spectrum  licensee  can  help  facilitate  the  development  of  a  hybrid  traditional  land 
mobile  radio  and  broadband  device,  that  development  will  provide  public  safety 
agencies with access to capabilities that will enable them to perform far more effec-
tively,  more  efficiently,  and  facilitate  improved  interoperability  using  Internet  Pro-
tocol  connections.  The  development  of  such  a  device,  however,  should  only  be  the 
beginning of an ongoing technological development cycle that will enable public safe-
ty  agencies  to  operate  more  effectively.  Indeed,  one  important  architectural  feature 
of a next generation network is that it can allow ongoing modular development and 
the use of secondary systems (e.g., commercial cellular systems, municipal WiFi sys-
tems, and satellite technology) to supplement the principal communications systems. 
The traditional model of buying expensive and specialized equipment dedicated to 
public safety has disserved public safety agencies by ensuring that they operate net-
works  using  equipment  that  is  quickly  antiquated  and  expensive  to  replace.  A  new 

10 It  is  critical  that  any  consequences  to  the  winner  of  an  auction  for  encumbered  spectrum 
be  confined  to  a  ‘‘reasonable  grounds’’  scenario.  Otherwise,  the  public  safety  spectrum  licensee 
would have an incentive to use its hold-out leverage to extract unfair and inappropriate conces-
sions from the encumbered spectrum licensee. 

11 The public safety spectrum licensee and its commercial partner will, in all likelihood, enter 
into  what  economists  call  a  ‘‘bilateral  monopoly  relationship.’’  Such  partnerships  are  generally 
characterized by mechanisms to guard against undue opportunistic behavior by one side, includ-
ing a stylized ‘‘hostage exchange’’ scenario, where each side gives something of value to the other 
and  can  threaten  to  keep  it  in  the  event  the  other  side  acts  unreasonably.  See  Oliver 
Williamson, The Mechanisms of Governance (1996). 

12 See  Phil  Weiser,  ‘‘Promoting  Informed  Deliberation  and  A  First  Amendment  Doctrine  For 
A  Digital  Age:  Toward  A  New  Regulatory  Regime  for  Broadcast  Regulation,’’  Deliberation,  De-
mocracy,  and  the  Media  (Costain  and  Chambers,  eds.,  2000).  As  Richard  Posner  explained  in 
his  classic  article,  the  use  of  a  spectrum  license—or  any  regulatory  program—to  achieve  such 
benefits indirectly can be termed ‘‘taxation by regulation.’’ Richard Posner, Taxation by Regula-
tion,  3  Bell  J.  Econ.  22  (1971).  As  Posner  explained,  such  an  approach  has  certain  merits,  but 
also comes with notable risks. Id.

model  whereby  public  safety  agencies  purchase  equipment  premised  on  commer-
cially developed standards would break from this tradition by enabling public safety 
agencies to benefit from technological advancements on an ongoing basis. Consider, 
for example, that cognitive radio technology continues to improve and should be able 
to  ultimately  facilitate  the  use  of  radios  that  can  operate  both  at  different  fre-
quencies  and  using  different  modes,  thereby  providing  a  promising  interoperability 
solution.13 Similarly, the ongoing development of satellite technology that can oper-
ate in conjunction with terrestrial wireless networks (the so called ‘‘ancillary terres-
trial  component’’  systems)  could  also  have  a  significant  impact  on  public  agencies 
by enabling them to have a redundant communications connection as well as a way 
to reach all outdoor coverage areas.14 

The  new  policy  model  necessary  to  promote  a  next  generation  network  will  take 
time  for  the  relevant  stakeholders  to  adjust  to  a  new  opportunity.  For  this  model 
to  be  successful,  it  is  critical  that,  in  addition  to  spectrum  policy  decisions  by  the 
FCC, other governmental actors (such as the Department of Homeland Security, the 
National  Telecommunications  and  Information  Administration,  and  state  and  local 
governments) all embrace and support this new policy strategy. Even with the effec-
tive  focus  of  all  involved,  this  process  will  take  years  to  succeed  and,  even  when 
complete,  it  will,  by  necessity,  be  imperfect  in  terms  of  its  overall  coverage  and  ca-
pacity.  This  model,  however,  provides  a  far  more  effective  solution  to  the  ongoing 
failings of public safety communications than any other strategy I can fathom. 
Conclusion 

In  short,  I  commend  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  for  recognizing 
that  public  safety  must  take  advantage  of  new  information  and  communications 
technology  opportunities—i.e.,  the  promise  of  a  next  generation  network  built 
around broadband technology—by acting as an enterprise that seeks to leverage the 
advances  of  a  converged  ecosystem.  That  ecosystem  features  ongoing  development 
of  new  technologies  for  commercial  users  and,  with  a  commitment  by  public  safety 
to adapt such technologies for its own needs, it can avoid the mistake of the Project 
25  initiative.  In  that  case,  public  safety  operated  in  an  environment  where  it  was 
confined  to  its  own  silo  and  could  only  use  equipment  produced  uniquely  for  it.  By 
embracing a strategy whereby it shares spectrum with one or more commercial part-
ners, public safety will facilitate a win-win arrangement where unused public safety 
spectrum can be put to good use, money from that leasing arrangement can be dedi-
cated to supporting public safety’s advanced communications needs, and public safe-
ty  can  have  access  to  more  spectrum  (than  it  would  itself  control)  when  it  needs 
it. 

The  opportunity  to  develop  a  next  generation  network  to  afford  public  safety  ac-
cess  to  cutting  edge  technologies  will  require  a  major  reorientation  on  the  part  of 
all  stakeholders  as  to  how  public  safety  agencies  use  communications  technology. 
This  reorientation  will  require  leadership  on  the  Federal,  state,  and  local  levels  as 
well as a compelling explanation as to how the public safety spectrum licensee con-
cept  can  facilitate  opportunities  that  will  otherwise  not  become  available  or  will  be 
prohibitively  expensive  for  most  agencies.  I  recognize  that  the  public  safety  spec-
trum licensee concept comes with some risks, but provided that this licensee is sup-
ported  by  able  advisors  and  with  a  sensitivity  toward  the  needs  of  individual  local-
ities, I believe this policy strategy is a sound linchpin of the effort to spur the devel-
opment  of  a  next  generation  network.  It  can  only  succeed,  however,  if  other  stake-
holders rally around this strategy and embrace the importance of a next generation 
network and work hard to make it a success. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
And may I call upon Commissioner Cosgrave.

STATEMENT OF PAUL J. COSGRAVE, COMMISSIONER AND CIO, 
INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY  AND 

DEPARTMENT  OF 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, CITY OF NEW YORK 
Mr.  COSGRAVE.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman 

Stevens, and Members of the Committee. 

My name is Paul Cosgrave. I am the Commissioner of New York 
City’s  Department  of  Information  Technology  Telecommunications. 
I also serve as New York City’s Chief Information Officer. Some of 
you may also remember me when I worked here as the CIO for the 
Internal Revenue Service. 

On behalf of the City of New York, thank you for the opportunity 
to  appear  before  you  today  to  discuss  how  the  interests  of  public 
safety  communications  can  be  safeguarded  in  the  upcoming  700 
MHz  band  auctions.  Clearly,  public  safety  communications  con-
tinue  to  face  significant  challenges  and  uncertainties,  even  as  the 
February  2009  deadline  for  a  transition  of  700  MHz  spectrum  to 
public  safety  and  commercial  use  fast  approaches.  New  York  City 
appreciates the FCC’s interest in potentially utilizing the upcoming 
700  MHz  spectrum  auction  to  advance  public  safety  communica-
tions and this Committee’s examination of the issue. 

At the same time, however, we’re deeply concerned about the po-
tential consequences of any FCC decision that mandates establish-
ment  of  a  nationwide  public/private  broadband  network  which 
would be shared by public safety and commercial users. Under the 
Frontline Wireless plan, a nationwide public/private network would 
be  deployed  in  22  MHz  of  spectrum  in  the  700  MHz  band—as  you 
know, 12 MHz of which has been currently allocated to public safe-
ty,  and  10  MHz  which  is  scheduled  for  commercial  auction.  The 
auction  winner  would  build  a  nationwide  network  and  negotiate 
with  a  newly  established  national  public  safety  licensee  over  re-
spective  access  rights.  Commercial  users  would  receive  secondary 
access to the public safety segment, and public safety would receive 
emergency access to the commercial segment. 

The  City  of  New  York  certainly  welcomes  the  establishment  of 
rules  that  would  make  more  spectrum  available  in  the  700  MHz 
and other frequency bands for public/private partnerships on a vol-
untary  basis  for  both  voice  and  data  communications.  However, 
we’re  concerned  about  the  imposition  of  such  a  sweeping  mandate, 
particularly  after  only,  at  most,  2  months  of  consideration  and  de-
bate. 

Ultimately,  New  York  City’s  present  view  is  that  public/private 
partnerships should be optional. Furthermore, decisions to enter in 
such  partnerships,  along  with  coordination  decisions,  should  take 
place  at  the  regional,  rather  than  at  the  national,  level.  And,  fi-
nally,  the  Federal  Government  must  not  dictate  use  of  particular 
frequency bands or technologies. 

The sudden emergence and popularity of proposals for public/pri-
vate  partnership  appears  at  least  partly  due  to  a  misperception 
that the public safety community is unable to solve its own commu-
nications  and  interoperability  needs.  This  is  typically  accompanied 
by  the  view  that  the  Federal  Government  has  invested  massive 
funding  and  allocated  a  great  deal  of  spectrum  to  support  local 
public  safety  efforts  and  that  commercial  intervention  is  now  nec-
essary.

Consequently,  I  believe  it  is  relevant  to  this  hearing  for  me  to 
share,  briefly,  New  York  City’s  perspective  on  Federal  funding  in 
spectrum  allocations  for  public  safety  communications  and  to  de-
scribe  the  state-of-the-art  broadband  wireless  network  New  York 
City is deploying virtually without Federal support. 

Unfortunately, for more than a decade the Federal Government’s 
provisioning of funding and spectrum to State and local public safe-
ty  communications  has,  in  fact,  been  inadequate.  New  York  City, 
which  is  at  the  highest  risk  for  another  terrorist  attack,  has  com-
mitted more than $1 billion of local taxpayer money since the 9/11 
attacks  to  enhance  our  public  safety  voice  and  data  communica-
tions networks and to upgrade and to harden our E–911 infrastruc-
ture. At the same time, we receive less than 20 cents on the dollar 
in  federally-funded  support  to  assist  these  homeland  security-re-
lated initiatives. 

Equally distressing is the perception that public safety has ineffi-
ciently used radio spectrum. Nearly 11 years ago, on September 11, 
1996,  a  high-level  Federal  advisory  committee  summarized,  ‘‘Not 
only  does  the  shortage  of  spectrum  jeopardize  the  lives  and  health 
of public safety officials, it threatens their ability to fully discharge 
their duty to protect the lives and property of all Americans.’’ 

Regrettably, since that warning cry 11 years ago, there has been 
no  national  provision  of  spectrum  to  support  emergency  responder 
voice communications. Indeed, absent action by this Committee last 
year,  public  safety  would  have  been  forced  to  wait  well  beyond 
2009  for  the  700  MHz  spectrum.  In  addition,  there  has  only  been 
a single—much appreciated, but exceedingly inadequate—provision 
of 4.9 GHz spectrum to support data applications. 

So, to summarize, the lack of Federal financial support and spec-
trum, rather than the flawed or inadequate efforts by the State and 
local  public  safety  communities,  are  at  the  heart  of  the  challenge 
to achieve advanced broadband services and interoperability. 

In  March  2004,  New  York  City  issued  a  request  for  proposal  for 
the  implementation  of  a  broadband  wireless  network  for  public 
safety  to  support  our  own  highspeed  public  safety  data  needs.  The 
solicitation,  which  was  agnostic  as  to  spectrum  and  technology, 
challenged the country’s leading systems integrators to propose the 
best-available  solution.  At  the  time,  no  Federal  programs  were 
available  to  assist  us  in  this  initiative,  and  the  public  safety  seg-
ment  of  the  700  MHz  band  was  earmarked  by  the  FCC  for 
narrowband  and  wideband  applications  rather  than  for  broadband 
use.  Consequently,  the  city,  at  considerable  local  expense,  went  it 
alone. 

In  September  2006,  after  evaluating  and  testing  several  com-
peting  solutions,  New  York  City  contracted  with  Northrop  Grum-
man  to  deploy  a  $500  million  highspeed  data  network  for  public 
safety.  The  network,  known  as  New  York  City  Wireless  Network, 
or NYCWiN, will enable a wealth of mobile and fixed applications, 
including  real-time  video,  rapid-response  lookup,  and  exchange  of 
rich  graphical  information.  NYCWiN  will  provide  critical  real-time 
information  to  the  city’s  first  responders  when  and  where  they 
need it. 

The  network,  which  is  already  operational  in  Lower  Manhattan 
and  scheduled  for  citywide  deployment  by  March  2008,  utilizes  10

46 

MHz  of  licensed  spectrum  in  the  2.5  GHz  band,  spectrum  which 
New  York  City  has,  indeed,  purchased  at  market  rates.  NYCWiN 
employs  UMTS  technology,  which  is  well  suited  for  highspeed  mo-
bile  data  applications.  Moreover,  NYCWiN  is  an  IP-based  network 
enabling  fully  interoperable  data  communications.  Essentially,  in-
formation  can  be  shared  instantaneously  among  multiple  agencies. 
New  York  City  is  working  through  its  existing  interoperable  com-
munications  relationships  with  its  partners  in  the  State,  Federal, 
and  regional  public  safety  agencies  to  ensure  their  access  to  the 
network, as well. 

The  FCC  is  now  considering  a  nationwide  buildout  of  a  public/ 
private  network  for  first  responders  on  the  700  MHz  frequency, 
which  aims  for  capabilities  similar  to  what  we’ve  done  with 
NYCWiN. New York City has described, in comments filed with the 
FCC,  various  factors  that  the  FCC  should  consider  in  evaluating 
the  merits  of  such  a  proposal.  In  the  interest  of  time,  I’ll  outline 
only our two most pressing concerns: 

First, a national network based on one-size-fits-all approach may 
not  meet  the  disparate  communications  needs  of  emergency  re-
sponders throughout the country. 

And,  second,  it’s  not  clear  such  a  network  would  be  engineered 

to meet the demanding mission-critical needs of public safety. 

With respect to the one-size-fits-all approach, as I just described, 
New York City is implementing a broadband data network that uti-
lizes UTMS technology on the 2.5 GHz band. Recently, the District 
of Columbia opted to deploy a broadband network, as well, that uti-
lizes a different technology—EV–DO technology—and different fre-
quency; they’re deploying on 700 MHz. 

These  cities’  respective  decisions  were  dictated  by  the  fact  that 
New York City and the Capital region must contend with much dif-
ferent  physical  environments  and  different  operational  priorities. 
Any  scheme  for  a  national  network  must,  from  technology  and 
spectrum-related  standpoints,  ensure  that  each  implementing  pub-
lic safety jurisdiction has the flexibility to evaluate and respond to 
its  own  circumstances,  both  physical  and  operational.  It  should  be 
no surprise that the same technology and spectrum that works well 
in New York City may not work well in Los Angeles, Boise, or, for 
that matter, even in Buffalo, New York. 

So,  to  accommodate  these  differences,  the  policies  and  rules  gov-
erning  the  700  MHz  band  must  recognize  the  need  for  flexibility 
and  discretion  at  the  local,  State,  and  regional  levels.  New  York 
City has implemented citywide and regional interoperability proto-
cols  between  and  among  our  emergency  responders  and  those  of 
neighboring counties in New York, as well as in New Jersey, along 
with  regional  authorities  and  various  State  and  Federal  agencies. 
New  York  City  participates  in  several  regional  planning  bodies, 
including  the  Region  8  Regional  Planning  Committee,  which  cur-
rently coordinates use of 700 MHz and 800 MHz channels. The re-
gional  role  in  interoperability  planning  should  be  preserved  with 
respect  to  broadband.  Nor  does  the  proposal  for  a  national  public 
safety  licensee  officially  address  how  channel  allocation  and  fre-
quency coordination will take place among various local, State, and 
Federal  entities  operating  in  a  common  area  and/or  responding  to 
the same emergency.

New  York  City’s  second  major  concern  is  that  the  proposed  700 
MHz public/private network will, in fact, be dominated by commer-
cial interests, and that deployment and maintenance will be under-
taken based on a return of investment rather than effectiveness of 
emergency response. 

The  current  FCC  rulemaking  includes  no  parameters  to  uphold 
mission-critical  standards,  and  public  safety  agencies  have  no  rec-
ognizable  right,  such  as  a  license,  to  protect  their  interests.  More-
over,  the  current  proposal  provides  no  indication  of  how  the  FCC 
will  address  the  complex  issues  of  ensuring  that  public  safety  has 
priority  access,  vis-a`-vis  commercial  interests,  and  that  access 
among various public safety authorities is appropriately prioritized. 
Ultimately,  emergency  responders  must  not  be  forced  to  rely  on 
a  carrier-grade  network,  which  would  most  likely  not  be  available 
to  them  when  it  is  most  needed.  Anyone  who’s  ever  experienced  a 
large-scale  emergency  knows  that  cell  phone  communications 
quickly  deteriorate  and  soon  become  impossible.  This  is  a  result  of 
several  factors,  including  competition  among  callers  for  access  to 
cell  antennas,  possible  degradation  of  the  wired  backbone  inter-
connecting the network, and frequently the loss of both commercial 
and backup power to the network. 

Compare  this  to  NYCWiN.  In  the  event  of  a  major  emergency, 
New  York  City  Government  will  be  able  to  prioritize  network  ac-
cess among various agencies and users. The network is being built 
with  redundant  backbones,  overlapping  coverage,  and  a  minimum 
of  24-hour  backup  power  at  every  site.  One  cannot  imagine  that  a 
commercial  carrier  would  be  willing  to  invest  the  capital  required 
to build such a robust, redundant network in New York City. 

Public safety cannot be put in the position of sharing a plain va-

nilla network, which, quite frankly, is really no option at all. 

In  the  final  analysis,  public  safety  systems  stand  in  stark  con-
trast  to  commercial  systems.  Deploying  and  maintaining  public 
safety  systems  entail  much  more  detailed  requirements,  analysis, 
engineering,  testing,  and  training.  Heightened  requirements  in-
clude  capacity,  coverage,  system  restoration,  reliability,  and  secu-
rity.  Public  safety  networks  require  greater  diversity  and  redun-
dancy. Moreover, there can be no experimentation in the public sec-
tor. As I think you all know, lives are at stake. 

In conclusion, the public/private partnership model holds promise 
and should continue to be developed as a means of deploying next- 
generation voice and data networks using various frequency bands. 
However, this model is also very new and, frankly, untested. Man-
dating that a portion of the limited spectrum currently allocated to 
public  safety  be  used  for  a  nationwide  public/private  broadband 
network  in  the  700  MHz  band  is  fraught  with  uncertainties  and 
risks. 

Chairman Inouye, this completes my statement. The City of New 

York greatly appreciates the privilege to be here today. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAUL J. COSGRAVE, COMMISSIONER AND CIO, DEPARTMENT 

OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS, CITY OF NEW YORK 
Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Stevens, Members of the Committee: 
My  name  is  Paul  Cosgrave.  I  am  the  Commissioner  of  New  York  City’s  Depart-
ment of Information Technology and Telecommunications. I also serve as New York 
City’s Chief Information Officer. 

On behalf of the City of New York, thank you for the opportunity to appear before 
you today to discuss how the interests of public safety communications can be safe-
guarded in the upcoming 700 MHz band auctions. 

Clearly,  public  safety  communications  continue  to  face  significant  challenges  and 
uncertainties—even  as  the  February  2009  deadline  for  transition  of  700  MHz  spec-
trum to public safety and commercial use fast approaches. 

New  York  City  appreciates  the  FCC’s  interest  in  potentially  utilizing  the  upcom-
ing  700  MHz  spectrum  auction  to  advance  public  safety  communications,  and  this 
Committee’s  examination  of  the  issue.  At  the  same  time,  however,  we  are  deeply 
concerned  about  the  potential  consequences  of  any  FCC  decision  that  mandates  es-
tablishment  of  a  nationwide,  public-private  broadband  network,  which  would  be 
shared by public safety and commercial users. 

Under the Frontline Wireless plan, a nationwide, public-private network would be 
deployed  on  22  MHz  of  spectrum  in  the  700  MHz  band—12  MHz  of  which  is  cur-
rently  allocated  to  public  safety,  and  10  MHz  of  which  is  scheduled  for  commercial 
auction.  The  auction  winner  would  build  a  nationwide  network,  and  negotiate  with 
a  newly  established  national  public  safety  licensee  over  respective  access  rights. 
Commercial  users  would  receive  ‘‘secondary  access’’  to  the  public  safety  segment, 
and public safety would receive ‘‘emergency access’’ to the commercial segment. 

The  City  of  New  York  certainly  welcomes  the  establishment  of  rules  that  would 
make more spectrum available in the 700 MHz and other frequency bands for pub-
lic-private  partnerships  on  a  voluntary  basis—for  both  voice  and  data  communica-
tions. However, we are concerned about the imposition of such a sweeping mandate, 
particularly  after  only  a  few  months  of  consideration  and  debate.  Ultimately,  New 
York City’s present view is that public-private partnerships should be optional. Fur-
thermore,  decisions  to  enter  into  such  partnerships,  along  with  coordination  deci-
sions,  should  take  place  at  the  regional,  rather  than  at  the  national  level.  And,  fi-
nally,  the  Federal  Government  must  not  dictate  use  of  particular  frequency  bands 
or technologies. 

The sudden emergence and popularity of proposals for public-private partnerships 
appears  at  least  partly  due  to  a  misperception  that  the  public  safety  community  is 
unable  to  ‘‘solve’’  its  own  communications  and  interoperability  needs.  This  is  typi-
cally  accompanied  by  the  view  that  the  Federal  Government  has  invested  massive 
funding  and  allocated  a  great  deal  of  spectrum  to  support  local  public  safety  ef-
forts—and that commercial intervention is now necessary. 

Consequently, I believe it is relevant to this hearing for me to share, briefly, New 
York City’s perspective on Federal funding and spectrum allocations for public safe-
ty communications; and to describe the state-of-the-art broadband wireless network 
New York City is deploying—virtually without Federal support. 

Unfortunately,  for  more  than  a  decade,  the  Federal  Government’s  provision  of 
funding  and  spectrum  to  state  and  local  public  safety  communications  has  been  in-
adequate.  New  York  City,  which  is  at  highest  risk  for  another  terrorist  attack,  has 
committed  more  than  $1  billion  of  local  taxpayer  money  since  the  9/11  attacks—to 
enhance our public safety voice and data communications networks, and to upgrade 
and  ‘‘harden’’  our  E–911  infrastructure.  At  the  same  time,  we  have  received  less 
than  twenty  cents  on  the  dollar  in  Federal  financial  support  to  assist  these  home-
land security-related initiatives. 

Equally distressing is the perception that public safety has inefficiently used radio 
spectrum. Nearly eleven years ago, on September 11, 1996, a high-level Federal ad-
visory  committee  summarized:  ‘‘Not  only  does  the  shortage  of  spectrum  jeopardize 
the  lives  and  health  of  public  safety  officials,  it  threatens  their  ability  to  fully  dis-
charge their duty to protect the lives and property of all Americans.’’ 

Regrettably, since that warning cry, there has been no national provision of spec-
trum  to  support  emergency  responder  voice  communications.  Indeed,  absent  action 
by  this  Committee  last  year,  public  safety  would  have  been  forced  to  wait  well  be-
yond  2009  for  the  700  MHz  spectrum.  In  addition,  there  has  been  only  a  single— 
much  appreciated  but  exceedingly  inadequate—provision  of  4.9  GHz  spectrum  to 
support data applications.

flawed  or  inadequate  efforts  by  the  state  and  local  public  safety  communities—are

at the heart of the challenge to achieve advanced broadband services and interoper-
ability. 

In March 2004, New York City issued a Request for Proposals for the implementa-
tion  of  a  broadband  wireless  network  for  public  safety  to  support  our  own  high- 
speed public safety data needs. The solicitation, which was agnostic as to spectrum 
and technology, challenged the country’s leading systems integrators to propose the 
best available solution. 

At  the  time,  no  Federal  programs  were  available  to  assist  the  City  in  this  initia-
tive;  and  the  public  safety  segment  of  the  700  MHz  band  was  earmarked  by  the 
FCC  for  narrowband  and  wideband  applications,  rather  than  for  broadband  use. 
Consequently, the City, at considerable local expense, ‘‘went it alone.’’ 

In September 2006, after evaluating and testing several competing solutions, New 
York  City  contracted  with  Northrop  Grumman  to  deploy  a  $500  million  high-speed 
data network for public safety. The network, known as the New York City Wireless 
Network,  or  ‘‘NYCWiN,’’  will  enable  a  wealth  of  mobile  and  fixed  applications,  in-
cluding  real-time  video,  rapid  database  lookup  and  the  exchange  of  rich  graphical 
information.  NYCWiN  will  provide  critical,  real-time  information  to  the  City’s  first 
responders where and when they need it. 

The network, which is already operational in Lower Manhattan, and scheduled for 
citywide  deployment  by  March  2008,  utilizes  10  MHz  of  licensed  spectrum  in  the 
2.5  GHz  band—spectrum  which  New  York  City  has  indeed  purchased  at  market 
rates.  NYCWiN  employs  UMTS  technology,  which  is  well  suited  for  high-speed  mo-
bile  data  applications.  Moreover,  NYCWiN  is  an  IP-based  network,  enabling  fully 
interoperable  data  communications.  Essential  information  can  be  shared  instanta-
neously  among  multiple  agencies.  New  York  City  is  working  through  its  existing 
interoperable  communications  relationships  with  its  partners  in  state,  Federal  and 
regional public safety agencies to ensure access to the network. 

The FCC is now considering a nationwide buildout of a public-private network for 
first responders, on the 700 MHz frequency band, which aims for capabilities similar 
to those of NYCWiN. 

New York City has described in comments filed with the FCC various factors that 
the FCC should consider in evaluating the merits of such a proposal. In the interest 
of time, I will outline our two most pressing concerns. 

First,  a  national  network,  based  on  a  ‘‘one-size-fits-all’’  approach,  may  not  meet 
the  disparate  communications  needs  of  emergency  responders  throughout  the  coun-
try. Second, it is not clear such a network would be engineered to meet the demand-
ing, mission-critical needs of public safety. 

With  respect  to  the  one-size-fits  all  approach,  as  I  just  described,  New  York  City 
is  implementing  a  broadband  data  network  that  utilizes  UMTS  technology  and  the 
2.5  GHz  band.  Recently,  the  District  of  Columbia  opted  to  deploy  a  broadband  net-
work  that  utilizes  a  different  technology  (EV–DO),  and  different  frequency  band 
(700  MHz).  These  cities’  respective  decisions  were  dictated  by  the  fact  that  New 
York  City  and  the  Capital  Region  must  contend  with  much  different  physical  envi-
ronments and different operational priorities. 

Any  scheme  for  a  national  network  must,  from  technology-  and  spectrum-related 
standpoints,  ensure  that  each  implementing  public  safety  jurisdiction  has  the  flexi-
bility  to  evaluate  and  respond  to  its  own  circumstances,  both  physical  and  oper-
ational.  It  should  surprise  no  one  that  the  same  technology  and  spectrum  that 
‘‘works’’  for  New  York  City  may  not  be  very  well  suited  to  Los  Angeles,  and  Boise, 
and Buffalo. 

To  accommodate  these  differences,  the  policies  and  rules  governing  the  700  MHz 
band  must  recognize  the  need  for  flexibility  and  discretion  at  the  local,  state  and 
regional  levels.  New  York  City  has  implemented  citywide  and  regional  interoper-
ability  protocols  between  and  among  our  emergency  responders  and  those  of  neigh-
boring  counties  in  New  York  and  New  Jersey,  along  with  regional  authorities  and 
various state and Federal agencies. 

Toward this end, the City participates in several regional planning bodies, includ-
ing  the  Region  8  Regional  Planning  Committee,  which  currently  coordinates  use  of 
700  MHz  and  800  MHz  channels.  The  regional  role  in  interoperability  planning 
should be preserved with respect to broadband. Nor does the proposal for a national 
public  safety  licensee  sufficiently  address  how  channel  allocation  and  frequency  co-
ordination will take place among various local, state and Federal entities operating 
in a common area and/or responding to the same emergency. 

New  York  City’s  second  major  concern  is  that  the  proposed  700  MHz  ‘‘public-pri-
vate’’  network  will,  in  fact,  be  dominated  by  commercial  interests,  and  that  deploy-
ment and maintenance will be undertaken based on a return on investment, rather 
than effectiveness of emergency response. The current FCC rulemaking includes no 
parameters to uphold mission-critical standards; and public safety agencies have no

recognizable right, such as a license, to protect their interests. Moreover, the current 
proposal  provides  no  indication  of  how  the  FCC  will  address  the  complex  issues  of 
ensuring  that  public  safety  has  priority  access  vis-a`-vis  commercial  interests,  and 
that access amongst various public safety authorities is appropriately prioritized. 

Ultimately,  emergency  responders  must  not  be  forced  to  rely  on  a  carrier-grade 
network, which would most likely not be available to them when it is most needed. 
Anyone  who  has  ever  experienced  a  large-scale  emergency  knows  that  cell  phone 
communications  quickly  deteriorate  and  soon  become  impossible.  This  is  the  result 
of several factors, including ‘‘competition’’ among callers for access to cell antennas; 
possible  degradation  of  the  wired  backbone  interconnecting  the  network;  and,  fre-
quently, the loss of both commercial and backup power to the network. 

Compare this to NYCWiN. In the event of a major emergency, New York City gov-
ernment will be able to prioritize network access among various agencies and users. 
The  network  is  being  built  with  redundant  backbones,  overlapping  coverage  and  a 
minimum of 24-hour backup power at each site. One cannot imagine that a commer-
cial  carrier  would  be  willing  to  invest  the  capital  required  to  build  such  a  robust 
network  in  New  York  City.  Public  safety  cannot  be  put  in  the  position  of  sharing 
a ‘‘plain vanilla’’ network, which, quite frankly, is no option at all. 

In the final analysis, public safety systems stand in stark contrast to commercial 
systems.  Deploying  and  maintaining  public  safety  systems  entail  much  more  de-
tailed requirements analyses, engineering, testing and training. Heightened require-
ments include capacity, coverage, system restoration, reliability and security. Public 
safety  networks  require  greater  diversity  and  redundancy.  There  can  be  no  experi-
mentation in the public safety sector, because lives are at stake. 

In  conclusion,  the  public-private  partnership  model  holds  promise;  and  should 
continue  to  be  developed  as  a  means  of  deploying  next-generation  voice  and  data 
networks  utilizing  various  frequency  bands.  However,  this  model  is  also  new  and 
untested.  Mandating  that  a  portion  of  the  limited  spectrum  currently  allocated  to 
public safety be used for a nationwide, public-private broadband network on the 700 
MHz band is fraught with uncertainties and risks. 

Chairman Inouye, this completes my statement. The City of New York appreciates 
very  much  the  privilege  to  participate  in  the  Committee’s  hearing.  I  would  be 
pleased to respond to your questions.

include  in  the  record,  a  letter  to  the  FCC  from  the  Rural  Cellular 
Association and Cellular South, Incorporated?

RE: RESPONSE TO CTIA COORDINATED EX PARTE COMMUNICATION—PS DOCKET 
NO. 06–229; WT DOCKET NOS. 96–86, 06–150, 06–16 

Dear Ms. Dortch: 

On  behalf  of  Rural  Cellular  Association 1 and  Cellular  South,  Inc.,2 this  letter  is 
to respond to the Ex Parte Communication coordinated by CTIA on behalf of 55 enti-

1 RCA is an association representing the interests of approximately 100 small and rural wire-
less  licensees  providing  commercial  services  to  subscribers  throughout  the  Nation.  RCA’s  wire-
less  carriers  operate  in  rural  markets  and  in  a  few  small  metropolitan  areas.  No  member  has 
as  many  as  1  million  customers,  and  all  but  two  of  RCA’s  members  serve  fewer  than  500,000 
customers. 

2 Cellular  South  is  the  Nation’s  largest  privately-owned  wireless  carrier  serving  all  of  Mis-
sissippi and portions of Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas and Florida. Most of the area served by 
Cellular South is rural in nature.

ties  that  oppose  adoption  of  the  Commission’s  proposed  geographic  build-out  re-
quirements in the 700 MHz Service Rules proceeding. 

The  CTIA  letter  misconstrues  the  Commission’s  geographic  build-out  proposal  as 
one  that  would  ‘‘force’’  or  ‘‘compel’’  700  MHz  licensees  to  construct  facilities  beyond 
the areas the licensees prefer to serve. That is simply not the case. In the Commis-
sion’s  words  the  proposal  in  question  ‘‘. . .  combines  performance  requirements 
based  on  geographic  benchmarks  and  a  ‘keep  what  you  use’  rule.’’ 3 This  arrange-
ment would allow licensees to make economically sound business decisions based on 
their ability and willingness to serve consumers in any area. To the extent that any 
licensee  chooses  not  to  serve  a  part  of  its  license  area  the  spectrum  rights  to  that 
area would be relinquished, but not before the licensee has opportunities after three, 
five and 8 years to protect a percentage of the market adjacent to the served areas. 
The  licensee  would  always  be  in  control  of  decisionmaking  over  what  areas  would 
be served, protected or relinquished. 

A ‘‘keep what you use’’ system is consistent with the pursuit of market-based solu-
tions  and  has  the  added  value  of  curbing  potential  inefficiencies  such  as  spectrum 
stockpiling  or  a  licensee’s  inability  to  build-out  the  areas  for  which  it  is  licensed. 
Secondary market transactions including spectrum leasing likewise could allow a li-
censee  to  work  with  other  companies  that  are  willing  to  serve  areas  not  a  priority 
for the original licensee. 

Strict  performance  requirements  based  on  geographic  coverage  are  vital  to  pro-
moting  near-term  availability  of  wireless  broadband  services  in  rural  areas.  The 
Commission’s  proposal  properly  recognizes  that  effective  use  of  700  MHz  spectrum 
to  be  auctioned  will  best  serve  consumer  interests.  Rural  communities  deserve  the 
opportunity to experience all the advantages that wireless broadband can offer. The 
alternative proposed in the CTIA letter is equivalent to proceeding without a safety 
net to guard against market failure and consumer harm. 

Respectfully submitted,

Senator  LOTT.  And  I  would  like  to  just  like  to  thank  the  panel 
for  their  testimony.  In  particular,  I’d  like  to  recognize  Mr. 
Barksdale, from my home State, college contemporary, a real lead-
er  in  telecommunications  and  business.  We  appreciate  all  you  do, 
and we appreciate, in this instance, once again, your willingness to 
get involved, even though it’s not something you particularly need; 
you’re involved in it, because of your interest in public service. And 
whether  people  agree  or  disagree  with  what  you’re  trying  to  do,  I 
think  you  should  be  commended  for  your  effort,  and  I  thank  you 
for that. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
Because  of  the  time  element,  I  will  be  submitting  my  questions 

to the panel. 

But my primary interest with respect to public safety is to deter-
mine  which  option  we’ve  been  discussing  would  give  our  first  re-
sponders  the  best  chance  of  building  a  nationwide  interoperable 
broadband-capable network. 

As  I  see  it,  first,  we  can  rely  on  local  and  regional  public  safety 
networks, as we do now; or, second, we can use the 12 MHz already 
allocated  to  public  safety  for  a  national  network;  or,  three,  we  can 
do something like the Frontline proposal and use public safety’s 12 
MHz along with 10 MHz of commercial spectrum. 

Under each of these scenarios, I’d like to know, what is your best 
estimate as to how much it will cost public safety to build and oper-
ate  a  next-generation  broadband  network?  And  how  long  will  it 
take to build this network across the Nation?

So,  this  is  a  complex  question  that  takes  some  consideration,  so 

I would hope that you will carefully respond to this question. 

May I now call on Senator Stevens? 
Senator STEVENS. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I will submit some questions also. 
But  I  want  to  try  to  examine  this,  and  I  don’t  want  to  be  offen-
sive, but it sort of looks like this is ‘‘Cyren Call’’ like proposal, that 
we  really  rejected  the  past  approach,  and  we’re  approaching,  now, 
a  different  concept,  but  it  comes  back  to  the  same  thing,  as  I  see 
it. 

Now—I  could  be  disabused  of  that—now,  Mr.  Barksdale,  it’s  my 
understanding that Frontline has indicated it will not comply with 
9-1-1  requirements  or  CALEA,  in  terms  of  public  safety,  in  terms 
of handling the mandatory court-ordered wiretaps for public safety, 
and you will not handle 9-1-1. Is that right? 

Mr. BARKSDALE. That is not correct, Senator. 
Senator STEVENS. What? 
Mr. BARKSDALE. I’m sorry, I need to turn this on. 
That  is  not  correct.  We  would  be  supportive  of  that,  and  we’ve 

already told the FCC that we would support those. 

Senator STEVENS. You would comply—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE. I don’t know where the—— 
Senator STEVENS.—with them? 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Sir—yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS. I’m told that Frontline indicated to the FCC it 
does  not  want  to  take  on  those  requirements,  and  asked  to  be  ab-
solved from complying. 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  I  do  not  know  where  that  came  from,  but  we 
have now told the FCC we’d be happy to do that. I also would point 
out—— 

Senator STEVENS. I only have 5 minutes, now. And—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator  STEVENS.—this  is  from  the  FCC,  ‘‘We  seek  comment,  as 
well, on Frontline’s view there’s no need to impose CALEA, E–911, 
or  similar  obligations  on  the  ‘E  Block’  licensee,  because  it  believes 
that retail service provides that spectrum and already is subject to 
similar requirements’’—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes. 
Senator  STEVENS.—‘‘for  the  blocks  that  they  already  have’’—not 

this—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes—— 
Senator STEVENS.—block, but the block—— 
Mr.  BARKSDALE.—that  was  the  FCC’s  language.  We  submitted 

technical papers that said that we could comply with it. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  it’s  my  understanding  that  that’s  what 
Frontline  submitted  to  FCC.  All  right,  well,  I’d  like  to  have  that 
straightened out. 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  That’s  not  true.  This  man  who  wrote  the  docu-

Senator  STEVENS.  I’d  appreciate  it  if  you’d  straighten  it  out  for

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir, I—we will get you the—— 
Senator STEVENS. Our counsel—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE.—exact answer.

Senator STEVENS.—says that was filed with the FCC. 
Mr.  BARKSDALE.  I  will  make  sure  you  get  the  exact  answer—— 
Senator STEVENS. All right. 
Mr. BARKSDALE.—in response—— 
Senator STEVENS. Now—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE.—to that. 
Senator STEVENS.—the Frontline proposal calls for allowing any-
one anywhere to access their dual-use network, as I understand it. 
If  that’s  the  case,  then  how  can  we  say  this  is  a  public  safety  net-
work? 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Because  normally  we’re  not  having  hurricanes 
and 9/11, and public safety, the amount of the 20 MHz it would be 
using, in most markets—not all, certainly, and maybe more in New 
York than in Boise—is a lower percentage of this enormous amount 
of spectrum. And then, when there is—— 

Senator STEVENS. But, now, wait—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE.—an emergency, we would have—— 
Senator  STEVENS.—what  do  you  do  with  it,  if  it’s  not  used  by 

public safety? Are you leasing it out? 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Yes,  sir.  We  are  leasing  or  selling  that  service. 
We  operate  a  network—as  opposed  to  previous  people  who  put  up 
money  and  tried  to  resell  spectrum,  we  would  actually  operate  a 
nationwide  network.  We  will  build  it  out  in  10  years,  covering  99 
percent of the population, we’ll put the money up front for the auc-
tion—— 

Senator  STEVENS.  But  where’s  the  partnership,  if  you’re  oper-
ating  it  and  you’re  selling  it,  you’re  getting  money,  and—are  you 
going to buy equipment for public safety? 

Mr. BARKSDALE. We are going to build the network. Public safety 

Senator  STEVENS.  That’s  not  what  I  asked,  now.  Are  you  going 
to buy equipment for public safety with the income from this public 
partnership? 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Which equipment? 
Senator  STEVENS.  The  equipment  for  them  to  go  into—new 

equipment for interoperability. 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Well,  there  are  two  pieces.  One  is  the  network, 
the  switching  equipment.  We  build  and—we  buy  that,  yes,  sir, 
every bit of it. 

Senator STEVENS. I understand that. But they—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Those handsets—— 
Senator  STEVENS.—have  a  requirement  for  equipment  to  become 
interoperable—they  have  a  requirement—public  safety  has  enor-
mous  requirements.  So,  I  want  to  see—and  the  Cyren  Call  said 
they  would  take  some  of  their  income  and  help  public  safety  buy 
that equipment. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. This is not Cyren Call. 
Senator  STEVENS.  I  understand  that.  Are  you  going  to  buy  the 

would—— 

public—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. We’re going to buy the network—— 
Senator  STEVENS.—are  you  going  to  buy  the  public  safety  any 

equipment, Mr. Barksdale? 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Yes,  sir,  $12  billion  worth  of  it,  at  least,  which 
is  the  network  that  will  be  interoperable.  They  would  have  to  pro-

vide  their  own  handsets.  They  are  certainly  free  to  use  different 
technologies  that,  in  New  York,  might  fit  differently  than  others, 
but  they  would  use  this  spectrum.  We  would  put  up  at  least  the 
$12 billion to build the network—from private funds, not from pub-
lic  funds—and  then  that  would  be  an  interoperable  network,  just 
like the cellular system works today. It’s interoperable. 

Senator  STEVENS.  We  only  have—each  of  us  have  just  so  much 

time. I’d really appreciate it—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes. 
Senator  STEVENS.—if  you’d  answer  my  questions.  I  understand 

what you said before. I’m just asking you questions. All right? 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes. 
Senator  STEVENS.  Now,  what  are  the  costs  of  this  network.  This 

network you wish to build out, what would be the cost of it? 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Approximately $12 billion. 
Senator STEVENS. And where will that money come from? 
Mr. BARKSDALE. From private investors. 
Senator  STEVENS.  It  won’t  come  from  the  leasing  of  the  spec-

trum? 

too. 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Well,  that’s  how  you  get  the  capital  of  the  com-
pany from private investors. Then they would resell the use of this 
network to commercial users, to wholesale users, to innovators, and 
to  others,  who  would  pay  by  the  minute  for  the  service,  and  that 
would  be  the  revenue  stream  that  would  pay  for  the  long-term 
business. 

Senator  STEVENS.  But  other  people  at  this  auction  are  going  to 

pay enormous sums of money for spectrum. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator  STEVENS.  They  will  have  the  ability  to  build  networks, 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator  STEVENS.  And  those  networks  would  be  accessible  by 

public safety people also, right? 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Not necessarily. 
Senator STEVENS. Why not? They’re just—anyone can access—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Well, they’re as accessible as they are today, but 
they’re  not  built.  As  was  pointed  out  by  the  gentleman  from  New 
York,  this  network  will  be  built  specifically  to  withstand  some  of 
the hardened requirements of public safety. 

Senator  STEVENS.  I’m  trying  to  understand  the  difference  be-
tween  Mr.  Cosgrave  and  your  position,  as  far  as  this  network  is 
concerned.  I  support  getting  public  safety  all  the  network  and  all 
the  money  we  can  possibly  get  them  to  provide  an  interoper-
able—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Right. 
Senator STEVENS.—system. Cyren Call led us to believe that the 
money  that  they  would  get  from  leasing  the  spectrum  would  be 
used  for  public  safety.  When  we  examined  that,  that  wasn’t  quite 
the case. 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  This  proposal  is  not  the  Cyren  Call  proposal, 

has nothing to do with it. 

Senator STEVENS. But what’s the difference? 
Mr. BARKSDALE. On this proposal, we take the public safety spec-
trum  and  this  other  10  MHz,  put  them  together,  build  a  network

right  down  the  middle,  covering  99  percent  of  the  people.  Private 
interests  build  the  network.  We  sell  out  the  portions  that  public 
safety doesn’t use. When public safety needs more for emergencies, 
they can absorb all of this commercial, through written agreements 
that  are  well  in  existence  before  this,  so  that  they  can  expand  the 
network.  In  a  case  of  Hurricane  Katrina  or  9/11,  they  get  all  the 
spectrum. But most of the time, you don’t have that; therefore, the 
spectrum  lays  fallow.  We’re  submitting  that  we  would  be  able  to 
wholesale  that  spectrum  to  the  people—to  small  cellular  carriers 
who  can’t  get  national  coverage,  to  innovators  who  can’t  get  on 
AT&T or Verizon’s system, as indicated in today’s Wall Street Jour-
nal,  the  people  who  are  willing  to  pay  for  it.  That’s  the  business 
risk we take. We’re willing to take the risk. Others may bid higher 
than  we,  and  they  may  get  the  spectrum.  But  that’s  the  idea,  that 
private  interests  would  love  to  do  this,  and,  as  a  great  benefit  to 
public safety, build it out. 

But,  to  Mr.  Cosgrave’s  point,  we’re  not  requiring  New  York  City 

to participate in this. It would be their option. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Really,  you  know,  I’m  out  of  time  already.  I’m 
trying to get questions. Would you please just answer my question? 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS. Now—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE. I apologize. 
Senator  STEVENS.—we  have—as  I  understand  it,  we  have  84 
MHz  before  us,  in  terms  of  the  total  concept  of  what’s  going  to  be 
available after the digital change in 2008. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. I think that’s correct. 
Senator  STEVENS.  And  if  I  understand  it,  the  public  safety  has 

24 MHz reserved already. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS. And you want to add 10 to that. 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS. But you would take 12 MHz of the existing 24 
MHz,  and  that  10  MHz,  and  you  would  control  it  by  this  private 
partnership  that  you  create.  Now,  this  is  a  stock  company,  right? 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS. Well, where’s the partnership? 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Well, before we can get the bid, before we start, 
we  have  to  have  signed  agreements,  as  Ms.  McCarley  said,  with 
the  public  safety  entity  that  we’re  proposing,  which  would  be  a 
public  safety  spectrum  trust  that  has  to  be  signed  and  agreed  to. 
And  that  is  the  partnership.  They’re  our  principal  customer.  They 
would be treated—they would be our largest customer. 

Senator  STEVENS.  You  would  be  able  to  lease  to  them  before  all 
this  demand  of  accessibility  for  the  public  safety  comes,  you’d  be 
able to lease 34 MHz—well, you’ll control 24—24 MHz to those who 
might otherwise bid for it at the public auction, right? 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Well,  10  of  it  to  others,  because  public  safety 

has already got 10. 

Senator STEVENS. But you’re going to control 12 from public safe-

ty, plus the 10 that you want—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir.

Senator STEVENS.—to Frontline. 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS. You’re not going to pay anything for that. 
Mr. BARKSDALE. We’re going to pay whatever the bid price is, bil-

lions of dollars. It could cost 20, 40 billion dollars to pay for it. 

Senator STEVENS. You’re going to bid on the 10 MHz? 
Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Yes,  sir.  That’s  the  whole  point.  We’re  not  ask-
ing  anybody  to  give  us  this  spectrum.  We’re  going  to  bid  on  it. 
There are others who are going to bid on it. And then, in addition, 
public  safety  gets  the  free  ride  of  the  network.  That’s  a  heck  of  a 
deal. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  it  is,  if  it  really—and  I  see  my  light’s 

on—it is, if the commitment is there to public safety. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Of course. 
Senator STEVENS. And I think—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE. And only if that’s true. 
Senator  STEVENS.—if  part  of  this  is  leased  out,  how  does  public 

safety get it after it’s leased out? 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Well, it’s just like the network works today, sir, 
everybody  participates,  but  some  have  higher  priorities.  Public 
safety would have the highest priority. 

Senator  STEVENS.  All  right.  Well,  then,  the  last  question  is,  if  it 

doesn’t achieve the goal, how does FCC get control again? 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Well,  that’s  part  of  the  agreement  that  would 
have to be nailed down. We’ve made some suggestions on that sub-
ject,  which  I  think  would  be  acceptable.  But  the  main  thing  is,  we 
would  have  to  put  the  money  up  front.  That’s  different  than  any 
prior new entrant has had to do. 

Senator  STEVENS.  I  applaud  the  difference  between  that  and 
Cyren Call, but I want to know, if it doesn’t achieve its result, how 
do we get it back so it can be auctioned again, and that money ap-
plied, the money that’s coming in, from—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS.—the auction is first dedicated to public safety. 

And—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. But a very small amount. 
Senator STEVENS. Well, it’s a billion dollars. Then we—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE. That’s not near enough, Senator. 
Senator  STEVENS.  I  understand  that,  but  we  had  earmarked 
some  money  to  repay  money  we  previously  put  up,  then  it  comes 
back and it—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS.—deals with public safety again. 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Correct. 
Senator  STEVENS.  So,  if  it  brings  in  the  kind  of  money  that  we 
think  it’s  going  to  bring  in.  It’s  going  to  be  a  tremendous  amount. 
Yours will be bid as part of the total of the 50 MHz that’s—no, the 
60 MHz available now? You’re going to be in competitive bid for up 
to 10 MHz, is that what you’re telling me? 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Yes,  sir.  A  portion  of  that  60  MHz—10  MHz  of 

it. 

Senator STEVENS. Who do you compete with on that?

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  People  who  buy  spectrum  to  build  out  net-
works—AT&T,  Verizon,  anybody  who  wants  to  step  up,  private  in-
vestors, public investors. 

Senator STEVENS. Well, I’m taking too much time. I’ll have some 
more  questions,  but  I  do  apologize.  In  terms  of  the  concept  that 
you’re going to be part of the—— 

Senator DORGAN. Could I ask him to yield—— 
Senator STEVENS.—auction. 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS. And you’re going to go in and bid for 10 MHz. 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator  STEVENS.  If  you  don’t  get  it,  this  doesn’t  work.  If  some-

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  No,  somebody  else  will  get  it.  We  ask  that  the 

FCC set it aside for this purpose—public safety—— 

Senator STEVENS. All right. Well—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE.—and combined with—— 
Senator STEVENS.—if it’s not in—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE.—their other. 
Senator STEVENS.—the public auction—— 
Mr.  BARKSDALE.  And  if  they  do  that,  somebody  will  bid  on  it.  If 

they—if nobody bids on it, it goes back into the—— 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  they  can  only  bid  on  it  to  compete  with 

you within your plan, right? 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Only  bid  on  it—I  didn’t  understand  the  ques-

one—— 

tion. 

Senator STEVENS. You want 10 MHz set aside to—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes. 
Senator STEVENS.—join the 12—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS.—and—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Exactly. 
Senator STEVENS.—you can bid on that. 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS. But for the purpose outlined in your Frontline 

proposal. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. And contractually agreed to with the represent-
atives  of  the  public  safety  community  and  the  FCC  in  the  United 
States. 

Senator  STEVENS.  But  the  people  that  are  competing  with  you 

have to agree with your plan on that 10 MHz. 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  For  that  10  MHz,  whoever  competes  with  us 

would have to agree to that plan, yes, sir. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Senator  Stevens,  could—would  you  yield  just 

Senator  STEVENS.  Yes.  I’m  sorry  to  take  so  much  time.  I  had  a 

problem with Cyren Call, and—— 
Senator DORGAN. I understand. 
Senator  STEVENS.—I’m  developing  another  problem  with  this,  I 

want you to know.

Senator DORGAN. But if you would yield just for—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE. This was a gift. 
Senator  DORGAN.—so  that  I  can  understand  the  point.  I  appre-

ciate the questions you’ve asked. 

Is  it  a  business  model  that  says  you  will  go  out  and  bid  on,  and 
hopefully  achieve,  the  10  MHz,  and  you’ll  pay  for  that,  and  then 
you block that with the 12 MHz that’s public safety. You—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes. 
Senator  DORGAN.  You  will  not  be  paying  for  that.  And  that—— 
Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  he’s  just  said  he  wants  10  MHz  set 

aside—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Right. 
Senator STEVENS.—to comply with his plan, and anyone else can 

compete and bid to fulfill that plan—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. There is an order here, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator  STEVENS.—fulfill  that  plan.  But  it’s  not  to  compete—to 
go and have a nationwide plan that would include service to public 
safety. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. I’ve been waiting a long time. 
Senator STEVENS. Thank you. I’m sorry. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Lautenberg? 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Mr.  Chairman,  there  are  fairly  com-

plicated issues here, and—— 

Senator STEVENS. Yes. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.—and  I  really  do  think  it’s  hard  to  thread 
through,  with  the  volume  of  testimony,  and  then  the  things  that 
we’d like to know more about. 

I’m  going  to  focus  on  Mr.  Cosgrave,  because  we’re  neighboring 
States,  and  we  both  shared  very  significantly  in  the  tragedy  of  9/ 
11, and saw what happened when police departments couldn’t com-
municate  with  fire  departments.  It  compounded  that  tragedy  by  a 
major factor. It just was very painful throughout. It has been, even 
in the later years. 

So,  now,  New  York  City  is  in  the  process  of—is  your  interoper-

ability requirement fully met, at this time? 

Mr.  COSGRAVE.  Well,  we’ve  certainly—in  New  York  City,  have 
made significant progress since 9/11. Commissioner Kelly and Com-
missioner Scapetta would certainly tell you, if they were here, that 
they  feel  the  police  department  and  fire  department,  respectively, 
have much better communications today, and that they are, in fact, 
capable of being interoperable. 

You  know,  there’s  a  lot  of  confusion  on  this  whole  question  of 
interoperability.  Fire  departments—first  responder  organizations, 
fire  departments,  police  departments,  are,  in  effect,  paramilitary 
organizations,  and  they  run  with  a  chain  of  command.  And  you 
don’t want every fireman to be able to talk to every policeman. So, 
this notion of interoperability being, sort of, everybody’s got to talk 
to everybody, is a false notion, to start with. What—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. But—— 
Mr.  COSGRAVE.—you  want  to  do  is  have  the  chains  of  command 
be  able  to  talk,  and  we  certainly  can  effect  that  today  very  effec-
tively. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. So, today, that part of the process—— 
Mr. COSGRAVE. Absolutely.

Senator  LAUTENBERG.—is  complete.  All  right.  Now,  how  about 
the same question related to communities, let’s say, in New Jersey. 
We’re,  after  all,  part  of  the  same  metropolitan  area.  So,  has  New 
York City addressed that part of the question? 

Mr.  COSGRAVE.  We  work  together,  we  have  committees  that—— 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Professor Weiser’s shaking—— 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. COSGRAVE. Yes, I noticed, as I looked at the right side, here. 
We  work  together,  we  have  committees  that  do  that.  But  I  would 
agree  with  Professor  Weiser’s  negative  nod  that  it’s  not  where  it 
needs to be. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. OK. So, then the objective of a nationwide 
service  is  still  the  right  way  to  go,  because  if  we  can’t,  across  our 
river,  be  clear  in  which  fire  department,  which  police  department, 
which boats, et cetera, are operating to respond to—— 

Mr. COSGRAVE. There’s no question about that. And the need for 
capital to build the infrastructure to allow this is a very real point. 
Clearly,  New  York  City,  recognizing  the  need,  and  Washington, 
D.C., recognizing the need, were able to raise the capital. But I un-
derstand the problem that other areas have—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Yes. 
Mr.  COSGRAVE.—where  they,  maybe,  don’t  have  the  resources  to 

raise the capital. So—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. That—— 
Mr.  COSGRAVE.—absolutely,  the  financing  of  this  is  a  major, 

major issue. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Yes.  And  that  will  be  a  problem  through-

out the country. I mean, we’re—— 

Mr. COSGRAVE. Correct. 
Senator LAUTENBERG.—especially areas that are close to one an-

other, and metropolitan areas, across a river, across a boundary. 

Mr. Barksdale, I just want to be sure that I heard something cor-
rectly that you said, and that was that safety—did I hear you say— 
would get a free ride—public safety would get a free ride? 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Public safety would not have to pay for the $12 
billion  network  that  we  would  build  nationwide,  that  they  could 
use;  that  is—that  would  be  built  out.  It  is  certainly  our  intention 
that  we  would  make  it  available.  But,  for  example,  in  New  York, 
if  they  already  have  a  system,  they  don’t  want  to  participate,  they 
don’t have to participate. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Right. But I think that the suggestion that 

safety gets a free ride—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Well, let me put it this way—— 
Senator LAUTENBERG.—people probably applaud that one. 
Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Well,  they  ought  to.  The  Wall  Street  Journal 
said, ‘‘This would lower the auction price if they compromise it with 
this  public  safety  thing.’’  What  they  forgot  is  the  $12  billion  to 
build  the  network,  that  we  all  dream  of  for  the  future,  is  going  to 
be  paid  for  by  the  same  taxpayers,  whether  they’re  State,  local,  or 
Federal.  Add  that  to  the  auction  price,  and  it  is  a  terrific  deal  for 
the  government,  for  the  taxpayers.  They  will  spend  less  money  on 
our proposal than any other proposal entertained.

And  I  couldn’t  disagree  more  with  this  Cyren  Call  thing.  It  re-
quires  no  legislation.  We  participate  in  the  auction.  It  has  nothing 
to do with that sort of proposal. 

This  is  a  great  deal  for  public  safety.  Does  it  solve  everything? 
Heck  no.  There  are  a  lot  of  things  public  safety  has  to  do.  But  it 
would  allow  them  to  focus  on  those  important  issues  without  wor-
rying  about  this  nationwide  network,  which  will  be  a  godsend  for 
them.  This  is  what  the  Governors  reported  in  Mississippi—we 
begged people to come in and do this after Katrina. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Well, since the threat of attack, the threat 
of  a  major  catastrophe  still  looms  large,  we’re  going  to  have  to 
spend  some  portion  of  our  annual  budget  in  these  areas,  because 
we spend $3 billion a week on the war that we’re presently in, and 
with  supplementals  boosting  that.  So,  we  pay  for  the  things  that 
we want to get done. And—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir, but one other thing—— 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  And  the  protection  of  the  public,  right 
now,  is  uppermost.  When  I  see—and  I  have  a  responsibility  for 
safety  and  security  in  transportation,  harbors,  and  so  forth,  as  a 
Chairman of the Subcommittee, and I see that—how pitifully small 
the  budgeting  is  for  these  things,  and  yet,  we  find  other  ways  to 
put money into programs that we question very sharply. 

Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Smith? 
Senator  SMITH.  Mr.  Barksdale,  if  I  understand  your  model,  the 
10  MHz  you’re  going  to  add  so  that  there’s  private  money  to  build 
out, what would then be available to the public—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator  SMITH.—it  would  be  leased—the  10  MHz  would  be 
leased  commercially,  but  those  leases  would  be  subject  to  the  call 
of public safety. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator SMITH. Who would trigger that requirement? 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Well, the agreement that would be specified be-
tween  whoever  wins  the  auction  and  the  public  safety  spectrum 
trust. 

Senator SMITH. And without the involvement of public or private 
money, the point you’ve made, and the point I made in my opening 
statement,  is  that  there  just  isn’t  going  to  be  the  money  to  build 
this out. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. No, sir, they won’t be built. The networks won’t 

Senator SMITH. OK. 
I wonder, Mr. Weiser—— 
Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Now—some  will,  now.  Obviously,  New  York, 
Washington,  some  others.  But  nobody  else  is  building  them  right 
now. 

Senator SMITH. But your point is, it won’t be built on a national- 

be built. 

enough scale. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. No way. 
Senator SMITH. OK. 
Mr.  Weiser,  if  adopted,  the  Frontline  proposal  would  impose 

many requirements on the ‘‘E Block’’ license.

61 

Mr. WEISER. Right. 
Senator  SMITH.  What  do  you  think  would  be  the  impact  on  the 
amount  of  money  the  auction  participants  would  be  willing  to  pay 
for the ‘‘E Block’’ license licensee if they were—if requirements are 
proposed? 

Mr.  WEISER.  It  would  probably  be  less.  It’s  hard  to  say  exactly 
how much, but the encumbered requirement of serving public safe-
ty,  as  Mr.  Barksdale  has  outlined,  is  a  fairly  demanding  responsi-
bility.  There  is  some  opportunity  that  comes  with  it,  which  is  to 
work with public safety and to use the 12 MHz of the national pub-
lic  safety  licensee.  So,  that  is  some  offsetting  benefit.  But,  on  net, 
I would imagine it would be less than otherwise would be obtained. 
Senator  SMITH.  If  these  regulations  that  Frontline’s  proposed 
were  adopted  in  a  general  rulemaking  that  applied  to  all  wireless 
now—or should they be applied to all broadband providers, in your 
view? 

Mr. WEISER. Sir, there are different sorts of regulations that are 
at  issue.  One  is  the  requirement  to  serve  public  safety.  That’s  the 
principal one. And that one, I think, is best done in a focused man-
ner,  because  public  safety  has  particular  needs,  and  it  needs  to  be 
done in a coordinated fashion. So, I don’t think it—that would work 
effectively across the board. 

Senator  SMITH.  So,  you  don’t  think  the  FCC  should  be  adopting 

rules for certain providers that do not apply to others. 

Mr. WEISER. I wouldn’t necessarily say it that way. I think that, 
you  know,  in  the  context  of  auction,  this  proposal  has  a  particular 
goal in mind, to serve public safety with one part of the spectrum, 
and I think, as I believe Senator Inouye said at the beginning, the 
only  goal  shouldn’t  simply  be  to  maximize  the  amount  of  auction 
revenue.  This  is  a  proposal  that  could,  you  know,  provide  the  roll-
out  of  the  next-generation  network.  And  I  think  that  is  a  proposal 
that, although a risk, can be managed, and can facilitate some good 
benefits. 

Senator SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator STEVENS. Could you ask him one—if you would yield—— 
Do you perceive competition to bid on that 10 MHz, based on this 

plan that’s prepared, by Frontline? 

Mr.  WEISER.  Sir,  I  do  think  there  can,  and  should,  be  competi-

tion. I will say—— 

Senator STEVENS. Wait, wait. From whom? 
Mr. WEISER. Sir—— 
Senator STEVENS. Who would compete with Frontline? 
Mr.  WEISER.  Sir,  I  think  there  could  be  a  number  of  providers 
out  there  who  would  see  this  opportunity.  The  opportunity  is  to 
build  a  next-generation  network,  from  the  ground  up,  with  public 
safety  as  an  anchor  tenant,  and  have  the  option  not  only  for  that 
10  MHz,  but  to  partner  with  public  safety  for  an  additional  12 
MHz.  So,  I  do  think  Frontline  will  not  be  the  only  bidder  who 
would come forward. And they’ll have to compete at auction to win 
this license. 

Senator SMITH. But that’s where the competition occurs, is at the 

auction. No other place.

62 

Mr. WEISER. Sir, there are a lot of companies out there who could 
bid.  Now,  I  will  say  one  thing,  which  I  explain  in  my  testimony. 
The requirement to serve this participation spectrum with an open- 
access  requirement  might  limit  some  bidders.  And,  although  I  un-
derstand the rationale behind that, I don’t know that it necessarily 
helps  public  safety,  per  se.  So,  that  could  be  limiting  the  bidding. 
But,  even  with  that,  I  still  think  there  are  going  to  be  others  who 
will  come  forward.  This  is  an  opportunity;  and  for  great  entre-
preneurs,  like  Mr.  Barksdale,  they’ll  see  it,  and  they’ll  try  to  seize 
it. 

Senator SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Dorgan? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
I  think  it’s  safe  to  say  this  is  beachfront  property,  and  it’s  very 
valuable, will be auctioned once, by and large, and establish policy 
choices  for  our  country  for  the  long  period.  I  want  to  try  to  under-
stand, based on Senator Stevens’ question, exactly the construct. 

Mr.  Barksdale,  my  understanding  is  this—and  correct  me  if  I’m 
wrong. You would propose to take 12 MHz that is reserved for pub-
lic  safety,  combine  it  with  the  purchase,  in  auction—presumably  a 
winning  bid  in  auction—of  10  MHz,  and  have  a  22  MHz  system. 
You don’t pay for the 12 MHz. You do pay for the 10 MHz. Is that 
correct? 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Actually, it’s—the 12 MHz becomes 10 MHz, be-

cause 2 MHz are guard bands and are not—— 

Senator DORGAN. Right. 
Mr. BARKSDALE.—usable. So, it’s really 20 MHz, yes, sir, 10 MHz 
of  which  would  be  public  safety’s  part,  10  MHz  of  which  we  would 
bid at auction. Yes, sir. 

Senator DORGAN. OK, 10 MHz of which you purchase at auction. 
You  take  the  public  safety  piece,  12  MHz—or  10  MHz.  You  don’t 
pay for that. And then you have 22 MHz, and from that, you build 
out a system and use it commercially, with a caveat that the public 
safety is going to have certain preferential rights and so on. 

So, I think I understand that. Now, the question is, at what price 
do you lease back that system to public safety? Or does public safe-
ty access that without cost? 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  No,  sir,  public  safety  would  agree  to  a  lease 
price, based on usage, that would be part of this agreement, agreed 
to by the public safety spectrum trust—— 

Senator DORGAN. And you’re leasing back—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE.—over time. 
Senator  DORGAN.—you’re  leasing  back  to  the  public  safety  use, 
that  those  that  would  use  it  for  revenue  for  your  for-profit  enter-
prise,  and  the  reason  that  you’re  extracting  revenue  from  them, 
even though it was their spectrum, is because you spent $10 billion 
creating the infrastructure—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Correct. 
Senator  DORGAN.—that  allows  the  system  to  exist.  All  right.  I 
think  I  now  understand  what  it  is  you’re  doing.  I  suspect  that  if 
the  FCC  sets  aside  the  10  MHz,  I  suspect  that  there’s  less  value 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 02, 2012 Jkt 074104 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74104.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

63 

to  it,  because  you  have  fewer  bidders.  So,  I  don’t  know  what  that 
‘‘less value’’ is, but I think that’s one of the questions that Senator 
Smith was asking. What ‘‘less value’’ will we have? Now, you might 
say, ‘‘We’ll gain value on the other side, to the extent that we have 
an interoperable network nationally to be used by public safety.’’ 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Right. 
Senator  DORGAN.  So,  you  have  one  consideration  of  how  much 

less revenue with fewer bidders for the 10 MHz, number one. 

Number  two,  what  is  the  cost  to  public  safety,  and  will  they  be 
able  to  afford  it?  And  under  what  conditions  will  you  be  restricted 
in  determining  reasonable  cost,  as  opposed  to  saying  to  the  folks 
in Fargo, North Dakota, ‘‘Look, here’s the system, we built it, here’s 
what we charge. If you don’t like the charge, tough luck.’’ You’ll be 
the  only  system  out  there,  so  you’ll  have  a  substantial  amount  of 
power  with  respect  to  what  you  decide  to  charge  public  safety.  Is 
that covered in the contractual relationship—— 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  Yes,  sir,  it  would  be.  And,  obviously,  as  the  an-
chor  tenant  would—of  any  development,  the  anchor  tenant  gets  a 
better deal than anybody else, and would be probably based on the 
cost  of  the  system  as  deployed,  and  not  a  retail  price.  It  would 
probably be based on a very favorable deal. We understand an obli-
gation to public safety. 

As  to  your  first  question,  the  taxpayer  is  benefited,  because  the 
taxpayer  gets  the  auction  money,  plus  they  don’t  have  to  pay  for 
the  network.  They’re  the  same  taxpayers.  So,  you  add  the  two  to-
gether, and that’s the value of the auction. 

To the third part of your question, I think that it is vitally impor-
tant  that  the  agreement  that—whoever  wins  the  agreement,  that 
they  sign  with  the  public  safety  trust,  that  it  be  a  good,  well- 
thought-out,  agreed-to  proposition  that  is  in  favor,  on  most—in 
most every area, toward public safety and not toward the commer-
cial interest. 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Barksdale—— 
Mr.  BARKSDALE.  But  there  has  to  be  a  written  agreement,  yes, 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Barksdale, you made the point about it in-
creasing  concentration,  I  should  say,  in  all  of  these  areas,  and 
that’s a point that I’m concerned about. I did read The Wall Street 
Journal piece that you referred to, and I think it raises, also, policy 
questions. 

I’d  like  to  ask,  with  respect  to  the  commercial  side  of  your  busi-
ness, because—you’re doing this because you’re creating a commer-
cial national network, and you’re using the public—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Right. 
Senator  DORGAN.—safety  piece  in  order  to  create  a  commercial 
national  network  that’ll  have  private  sector  investors,  it’ll  have 
stockholders and so on. 
Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes. 
Senator DORGAN. And so, it’s a profit-motive system, and with re-
spect  to  that  piece  of  what  you’re  doing,  I’d  like  to  ask  your  inten-
tions with respect to the issue of open access, for example, as a pol-
icy matter. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. It is our intention that it be an open-access sys-

sir.

Senator  DORGAN.  And  how  would  you  provide  that  guarantee  to 

the FCC and to the Congress? 

Mr. BARKSDALE. That there are certain—there are about three or 
four requirements of what ‘‘open access’’ means. And that would be 
identified  in  our  agreement  with  the  FCC.  It’s  part  of  the  rules— 
it  would  be  part—hopefully,  part  of  the  rulemaking  that  the  FCC 
will  provide,  here  in  the  next  few  weeks,  that  will  drive  the  auc-
tion,  because  it  needs  to  be  identified.  ‘‘Open  access,’’  to  some 
means something different than ‘‘open access’’ to others. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Well,  it  does,  and  it’s  a  particularly  important 
policy  choice,  at  this  point,  given—I  mean,  you  reference  it  in 
your—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes. 
Senator DORGAN.—testimony, and show us The Wall Street Jour-

nal article of this morning. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Right. 
Senator DORGAN. The other that will cause an apoplectic seizure 
here  on  the  Committee  whenever  I  mention  it  is  the  issue  of  net-
work  neutrality.  We’ve  had  some  pretty  aggressive  discussions  on 
this Committee about the policy of network neutrality. 

Have you taken a look at those discussions? And how do you see 
your  commercial  enterprise  with  respect  to  those  issues?  Because 
we’ve had some suggest that they’d like to be gatekeepers. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Right. Well, I’m not an expert on net neutrality. 

I’ll give you a written response. 

But, in general, all of this service will be wholesaled, other than 
that provided to public safety, which will be, basically, at cost. And 
the  wholesale  purchaser  of  this  can  run  it  however  they  choose  to 
run  it.  If  it’s  open  access,  they  can  use  whatever  technology  they 
want  to  run.  So,  the  issue  of  net  neutrality,  it  seems  to  me,  is  a 
lot less on a system like this than it is for an ingrained incumbent 
carrier. 

Senator  DORGAN.  And,  finally,  you  indicated  that  your  service 
would  cover  99  percent  of  the  country.  One  hopes  that  the  1  per-
cent isn’t in Hettinger County, North Dakota, or—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  DORGAN.—similar  area.  You  were  careful  to  point  out 

that—— 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Senator, I can assure you—— 
Senator DORGAN.—you cover Hawaii and—— 
Mr. BARKSDALE.—it won’t—— 
Senator DORGAN.—Alaska. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. BARKSDALE. I guarantee it won’t be. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you.  I  think,  you  know, 
these  questions  are  really  interesting  and  important,  and  I  think 
we’re  understanding  much  more  about  these  policy  choices.  Thank 
you very much. 

And I thank the rest of the witnesses, as well. 
Senator STEVENS. Mr. Chairman, just one comment, if I may. 
Senator Inouye and I battled for two Congresses to get the right 
to  auction  spectrum,  to  start  with.  And  we  earmarked,  in  existing 
law,  the  first  billion  dollars  for  public  safety.  I  think  we  should

amend the existing law and increase it to, say, $5 billion, whatever 
is  required,  to  build  out  the  public  safety  needs,  and  let  the  spec-
trum  continue  to  be  auctioned  on  the  basis  of  who  will  pay  to  get 
a  system.  They’re  all  going  to  build  out  broadband.  As  a  practical 
matter,  this  is  the  new  broadband  frequencies  that  we’re  talking 
about. As I understand it, there will be broadband built out. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. Right. 
Senator STEVENS. And what the public safety really needs is the 
money to organize and do what New York has tried to do, but they 
haven’t  had  enough  money  to  even  complete  there,  right,  Mr. 
Cosgrave I said I wouldn’t ask you any questions. But—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  STEVENS.—the  concept  we  have  here,  as  far  as  I’m  con-
cerned, is splitting off from our original concept that we’re going to 
auction all this spectrum. This 10 MHz would be auctioned only to 
people who would comply with the Frontline plan, and I think that 
will  lower  the  value  of  it,  and  will  lower  the  value  of  the  other 
spectrum.  Much  better  to  raise  the  value  of  it  all  and  let  public 
safety have what they need now, and depend upon the Treasury for 
the  future.  We  could  give  them  as  much  as  $5  billion  out  of  this 
one,  I’m  sure.  The  original  bid  was  estimated  to  bring  in,  what, 
$250 million. Did you know that? It brought in $18 billion. 

Mr. BARKSDALE. I was a bidder. 
Senator STEVENS. I hope you were successful—you were success-

Mr. BARKSDALE. Yes, sir. 
Senator  STEVENS.  You  profited  very  greatly  off  of  it,  as  I  under-
stand,  and  I  congratulate  you  for  that.  There’s  no  reason  why  this 
should not go into the private sector and be profitable, too. And fu-
ture  income  from  all  of  that  will  assist  the  development  beyond 
what we could do with the initial bid. 

So, I’m going to look at increasing the allocation to public safety 

ful, yes. 

on the original bid. 

billion. 

Mr.  BARKSDALE.  All  I’m  saying  is,  it’ll  take  a  lot  more  than  $5 

Senator STEVENS. I agree. But $5 billion for the first initial part 

of it, that would cover at least 4 or 5 years. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Thune? 
Senator THUNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  appreciate  you  holding  the  hearing.  I  don’t  have  any  questions 
for this panel. I’ll wait until we—let you get the next panel started. 

Thanks. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  It  is  obvious  that  the  issue  of  the  proposal  sub-
mitted  by  Frontline  will  be  the  determining  factor  in  the  outcome 
of  this  measure.  And  this  measure,  this  part,  concerns  first  re-
sponders  and  public  safety  officials.  And  we  haven’t  heard  from 
them. 

So,  Ms.  McCarley,  what  do  you  think  of  this  proposal  of  Front-

line? 

Ms. MCCARLEY. Thank you, Chairman Inouye.

66 

The  Frontline  proposal  is  very  interesting,  and  it’s  very  innova-
tive, and it points us in a direction that I think leads us to a solu-
tion. 

Now,  a  thing,  I  think,  that  needs  to  be  stressed  more  fully  here 
is  that  a  critical  component  is  the  public  safety  trust,  and  what 
public  safety  would  suggest  to  you  is,  through  that  trust,  both  the 
public safety spectrum and the commercial spectrum could be com-
bined to create a system, a broadband system, with control, leaving 
that  in  control  of  public  safety  agencies  through  the  trust.  And  we 
have even explored how we would put that trust together. And, you 
know,  we  would  suggest  that  ownership  would  be  public  safety.  It 
would  be  representative  of  public  safety,  under  the  advisement  of 
public  safety,  and  under  the  control  of  public  safety  at  all  times. 
Many  of  the  issues  that  have  been  put  on  the  table  here  could  be 
solved  by  a  strong  single  licensee,  if  you  will,  who  could  negotiate 
a very good contract. 

So, I think we’ve heard some very interesting dialogue here, and 
it  reinforces,  even  more,  the  principle  that  we  need  a  very  strong 
single licensee to address the issues. 

The CHAIRMAN. Well, I’d like to thank the panel. 
Mr.  Barksdale,  you  should  get  time-and-a-half  for  your  perform-

ance here. 

[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. And, if I may, I’d like to submit my questions to 

you, and would look forward to receiving your response. 

Thank you very much. 
Our  next  panel  consists  of  the  Executive  Vice  President  and 
Chief  Technical  Officer  of  Verizon  Wireless,  Mr.  Dick  Lynch;  the 
Chief  Executive  Officer,  Centennial  Communications  Corporation, 
Mr.  Michael  Small;  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Txtbl,  Dr. 
Amol R. Sarva. 

May I call upon Mr. Lynch. 

STATEMENT  OF  RICHARD  J.  LYNCH,  EXECUTIVE  VICE 
PRESIDENT  AND  CHIEF  TECHNICAL  OFFICER,  VERIZON 
WIRELESS 
Mr. LYNCH. Yes, thank you, Senator. 
Good  morning  to  you,  Chairman  Inouye  and  Co-Chairman  Ste-

vens, and members of the Committee. 

It’s  a  privilege  to  be  with  you  this  morning  to  discuss  the  700 
MHz auction. Thank you for affording me this opportunity to share 
with you the views of Verizon Wireless on this, obviously, very im-
portant topic. 

Congress,  the  Administration,  and  the  FCC  have  all  declared 
that  the  deployment  of  broadband  services  to  the  American  public 
is  a  critical  goal.  The  auction  has  the  potential  to  make  a  major 
contribution  to  delivering  the  benefits  of  broadband  to  consumers 
and  businesses,  while  helping  to  sustain  America’s  leadership  in 
the  world  economy.  However,  I  did  use  the  word  ‘‘potential,’’  be-
cause  to  achieve  these  benefits,  the  auction  must  make  the  spec-
trum  available  in  ways  that  will  promote,  not  cripple,  broadband 
deployment.  My  years  of  experience  in  building  wireless  networks 
tell  me  that  the  700  MHz  auction  can  unlock  even  more  benefits, 
but only if it’s done correctly.

I’d like to discuss what I see as two critical actions that the FCC 
should take to help deliver on the 700 MHz promise for broadband. 
First,  the  FCC  should  adopt  a  band  plan  that  will  enable  rapid 

deployment of next-generation wireless broadband networks. 

Second,  the  FCC  should  decline  to  impose  eligibility,  wholesale, 
open access, or net neutrality requirements on the band. Those re-
quirements  are  unwarranted,  would  deter  innovation,  and  would 
not benefit consumers. 

The  upcoming  auction  will  enable  the  development  and  deploy-
ment of new fourth-generation, or 4G, wireless technologies and set 
in  place  the  platform  for  services  that  will  yield  tremendous  bene-
fits to consumers, businesses, and first responders, alike. 

Verizon  Wireless  believes  firmly  in  the  broadband  future,  as  en-
visioned  by  Congress,  the  FCC,  and  the  Administration.  We  have 
spent billions of dollars over the past several years to deploy wire-
less  broadband  across  this  Nation.  The  FCC  has  offered  a  variety 
of band plans for auctioning the 700 MHz spectrum. 

Verizon Wireless supports FCC proposal number 3, with regional 
licenses  in  the  upper  band.  We  believe  that  this  plan  is  the  only 
one  that  meets  the  government’s  goals  for  this  spectrum.  It  would 
make  available  a  wide  variety  of  licenses  to  meet  varying  bidders’ 
needs,  including  a  20  MHz  spectrum  block  that  will  enable  very 
high  data  speeds  for  broadband.  It  would  also  include  public  safe-
ty’s need for spectrum alignment along the Canadian border. 

Now,  let  me  talk  for  a  minute  about  open  access  and  net  neu-
trality.  These  terms  have  been  subject  to  much  discussion,  but,  I’d 
submit, with little or no real specificity. 

Frontline offers some vague requirements that the licensee must 
permit a wireless device to connect to the network, and that the li-
censee operates solely as a wholesale service provider. Many public 
safety  agencies  have  raised  doubts  about  how  much  such  open-ac-
cess  requirements  would  impact  them.  And,  as  an  operator,  I  can 
tell you I have similar concerns. Saddling the spectrum with these 
open  access  obligations  would  reduce  interest  in  the  spectrum  at 
auction,  positioning  Frontline  to  acquire  the  spectrum  at  a  price 
substantially below market value. 

I  have  similar  concerns  about  a  net  neutrality  mandate,  as  I  do 
open  access.  Generally,  proponents  of  the  concept  focus  on  issues 
involving  traffic  routing  and  management.  If  what  the  proponents 
are talking about are the rights of users to access the public Inter-
net, and access applications of their choice, wireless customers can 
already  do  that.  If,  however,  they  want  to  preclude  wireless  car-
riers  from  offering  their  own  value-added  products  and  services, 
then I disagree. 

The  reliability  of  our  wireless  network  and  its  ability  to  serve 
over 60 million customers, including hundreds of thousands of pub-
lic safety users, is directly tied to our ability to manage the devices, 
ensuring  that  they  do  not  monopolize  all  available  capacity,  block 
other  users,  or  allow  spam  and  viruses  to  invade  the  network. 
Open  access  and  net  neutrality  regulations  would  strip  away  our 
ability  to  manage  our  network  for  the  benefit  of  all  of  our  cus-
tomers. 

So,  in  conclusion,  Verizon  Wireless  urges  the  700  MHz  auction 
be  held  as  soon  as  possible,  utilizing  proposed  band  plan  3,  and 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 02, 2012 Jkt 074104 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74104.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

68 

without  rules  that  would  foreclose  bidders  or  impose  unfounded 
and ill-advised requirements. 

And,  if  I  might  add,  Senator  Stevens,  I  believe  you  focused  us, 
this  morning,  on  a  very  important  issue.  Focusing  on  the  dollars 
necessary to equip public safety at the terminal end, as well as the 
network end, is a very significant part of what public safety really 
needs. And I think one clear way to do that is to maximize the auc-
tion proceeds that we could achieve with this auction. 

With  that,  I’d  like  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear 

today, and look forward to your questions. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Lynch follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD J. LYNCH, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND 

CHIEF TECHNICAL OFFICER, VERIZON WIRELESS 

Good  morning,  Chairman  Inouye,  Co-Chairman  Stevens,  and  members  of  the 
Committee.  It  is  a  privilege  to  be  with  you  this  morning  to  discuss  ‘‘The  700  MHz 
Auction: Public Safety and Competition Issues.’’ Thank you for affording me this op-
portunity  to  share  with  you  the  views  of  Verizon  Wireless  on  this  important  topic. 
Introduction and Summary 

Congress, the Administration and the FCC have all declared that the deployment 
of broadband services to the American public is a critical goal. The 700 MHz auction 
has the potential to make a major contribution to expanding broadband and to deliv-
ering the many benefits of broadband to consumers, businesses, and America’s lead-
ership in the world economy. I say, however, the potential—because to achieve these 
benefits,  the  auction  needs  to  make  the  spectrum  available  in  ways  that  will  pro-
mote,  not  cripple,  broadband.  My  years  of  experience  in  building  wireless  networks 
tells  me  that  the  700  MHz  auction  can  unlock  even  more  benefits—but  only  if  it’s 
done right. 

I  thus  want  to  discuss  what  I  see  as  two  critical  actions  the  FCC  should  take  to 

help deliver on 700 MHz’s promise for broadband. 

First,  the  FCC  should  adopt  a  band  plan  for  700  MHz  that  will  enable  rapid  de-

ployment of next generation wireless broadband networks. 

Second, the FCC should not impose eligibility, wholesale, open access or net neu-
trality  requirements  on  the  700  MHz  band.  Those  requirements  are  unwarranted, 
would deter innovation, and would not benefit consumers. 
The  700  MHz  Band  Plan  Should  Promote  Broadband  Deployment  While 
Making Available a Mix of License Sizes, and FCC Proposal 3 Does That 
The  upcoming  auction  will  enable  the  development  and  wide  deployment  of  new 
fourth  generation—or  ‘‘4G’’—wireless  technologies  and  services  that  will  yield  tre-
mendous benefits to consumers, businesses, and first responders alike. 

In  1997,  when  Congress  adopted  the  DTV  transition  plan,  wireless  data  services 
were  very  limited—typically  providing  only  about  15–20  kilobits  per  second.  Today, 
broadband  wireless  technologies  like  CDMA  EV–DO  have  been  widely  deployed, 
supporting  data  rates  of  hundreds  of  kilobits  per  second  and  a  wide  variety  of  mo-
bile  applications.  Verizon  Wireless’  mobile  broadband  network,  the  first  in  the  na-
tion, is available to more than 200 million people who can access broadband services 
on their laptops, e-mail on their PDAs, and V–CAST Video and Music on their wire-
less  phones.  We  are  now  deploying  the  latest  enhancement  to  CDMA  technology, 
EV–DO  Revision  A,  which  will  increase  data  speeds  further  and  support  new 
broadband applications. 

New ‘‘4G’’ technologies are being developed that will support mobile data rates of 
tens of megabits per second. They will unleash a host of new broadband applications 
that  will  rival  anything  available  today  on  wired  broadband  networks.  Doctors  will 
be  able  to  access  medical  records  and  CAT  scans  wirelessly;  firefighters  will  have 
wireless  access  to  images  of  building  interiors  and  floor  plans.  These  wireless 
broadband  technologies  promise  to  improve  the  lives  of  American  citizens  in  many 
ways. 

Verizon Wireless believes firmly in the broadband future envisioned by Congress, 
the FCC and the Administration. We have spent billions of dollars over the past sev-
eral years to bring wireless broadband to the nation, participating in spectrum auc-
tions and investing many billions more on technology and infrastructure. We believe

we are the most efficient spectrum user in the nation—and perhaps the world—and 
proud  of  it.  We  serve  more  customers  with  less  spectrum  than  any  other  operator. 
However, the ability of Verizon Wireless—and the entire industry—to continue to 
deliver  on  this  broadband  vision  requires  access  to  additional  spectrum,  auction 
rules that are open and competitive, and service rules that are flexible and market- 
based.  The  700  MHz  spectrum  will  enable  qualified  and  committed  operators  to 
make  a  real  difference  in  expanding  the  reach  of  broadband  services,  if  it  is  auc-
tioned  in  ways  that  will  facilitate,  not  hamper,  deployment  of  those  new  4G  tech-
nologies. 

The  FCC  has  offered  a  variety  of  band  plans  for  auctioning  the  700  MHz  spec-
trum. Verizon Wireless supports FCC Proposal 3, with regional licenses in the upper 
band.  A  copy  of  this  band  plan  is  attached  to  my  testimony.  We  believe  this  plan 
is the only one that meets the government’s goals for this spectrum. 

• By  using  regional  area  licenses  in  the  upper  band,  coupled  with  smaller  area 
licenses in the lower band, it makes available the right mix of license sizes and 
creates  opportunities  for  a  variety  of  applicants,  business  plans,  and  tech-
nologies. More than 900 licenses would be available for auction. 
• It provides adequate contiguous spectrum—22 MHz—to support very high data 
• It  accommodates  public  safety’s  need  for  useable  narrowband  spectrum  along 

speeds for 4G broadband deployment. 

the Canadian border. 

Let me elaborate on why this band plan should be adopted. First, it is important 
to keep in mind that the entire 700 MHz commercial band should be considered as 
a whole. With the DTV transition, Congress provided a total of 84 MHz of new com-
mercial  spectrum,  including  24  MHz  that  has  already  been  auctioned.  This  leaves 
60  MHz—30  MHz  in  each  of  the  upper  and  lower  bands—left  to  be  auctioned. 
Thanks to technical rules the FCC already put in place, both bands are well suited 
for mobile broadband services. Any band plan should reflect what has already been 
auctioned. 

Second,  we  agree  with  the  FCC  that  the  700  MHz  band  should  include  a  mix  of 
different  license  sizes.  The  FCC  has  already  achieved  part  of  that  goal  by  licensing 
a  significant  amount  of  700  MHz  spectrum  in  the  lower  band  in  small  blocks  to 
smaller wireless companies, and it plans to license all remaining ‘‘paired’’ spectrum 
in the lower band based on smaller markets, including another 700-plus licenses in 
the smallest areas, cellular market areas, which can be as small as one county. The 
lower band will thus provide 36 MHz of spectrum licensed on a small market basis, 
providing ample opportunities for smaller carriers. 

What the FCC has not done to date is to auction larger 700 MHz licenses. It can 
accomplish  this  by  including  a  20  MHz  paired  block  of  spectrum,  to  be  licensed 
across  wide  geographical  areas,  such  as  the  Regional  Economic  Area  Groupings 
(REAGs) used by the FCC in last year’s auctions for the Advanced Wireless Services 
(‘‘AWS’’). This band plan will help ensure the near-term deployment of next genera-
tion wireless broadband networks and to provide the best opportunity for the United 
States to lead the world in 4G wireless development and deployment. 

A  contiguous  20  MHz  block  is  important  because  it  will  encourage  optimized  use 
of  that  spectrum  for  4G  technologies  and  the  services  it  can  provide.  It  is  essential 
that the 700 MHz band plan include at least one spectrum block of at least 20 MHz 
in total bandwidth, as it did in the band plans for cellular, PCS and AWS. 

Larger regional licenses such as REAGs are important because, for over a decade 
now,  we  have  witnessed  the  benefits  of  wide  area  licenses  in  promoting  nationwide 
deployment of new technologies. Consumers demand nationwide service and carriers 
must meet that demand. History has shown, almost without exception, that smaller- 
sized  licenses  wind  up  becoming  aggregated  so  that  carriers  can  achieve  economies 
of  scope  and  scale  and  operate  as  viable  businesses,  enabling  them  to  compete  and 
deliver  better  products  at  lower  prices  to  consumers.  Aggregating  spectrum  post 
auction  takes  many  years  and  is  expensive  to  carriers  and  costly  to  consumers.  If 
Congress  wants  next  generation  wireless  networks  to  be  a  near-term  reality,  the 
FCC must auction and license sufficient spectrum on a REAG basis. 
The  700  MHz  Rules  Should  Provide  Spectrum  Opportunity  for  All  Without 
Unjustified  Constraints  That  Will  Undermine  Innovation  and  Harm 
Consumers 

Beyond  questions  of  technology  lies  the  critical  need  to  maintain  integrity  in  the 
auction process. The Commission should set auction rules that allow for full and fair 
competition by qualified bidders, without artificial and unwarranted constraints. 

Spectrum  auctions  for  commercial  spectrum  licenses  have  been  one  of  the  great 
success  stories  of  communications  policy.  Over  the  past  10  years,  these  auctions

have  raised  many  billions  of  dollars  for  the  U.S.  Treasury  and  accelerated  the  roll- 
out  of  new  and  innovative  services  for  consumers.  The  resulting  competition  in  the 
mobile  marketplace  has  provided  a  broad  range  of  digital  offerings,  extensive  cov-
erage,Email  high  quality,  and  low  prices.  In  short,  competitive  spectrum  auctions 
have  been  a  good  deal  for  American  consumers.  The  government  should  not  depart 
from that success. 

1.  Auction  Eligibility  Restrictions.  Some  parties  have  sought  to  game  the  auction 
process  by  proposing  to  exclude  or  restrict  local  exchange  carriers,  cable  operators, 
and  wireless  carriers  from  eligibility  for  licenses  in  the  700  MHz  band.  Such  dis-
criminatory eligibility restrictions are aimed at the companies most ready to deploy 
next  generation  broadband  networks.  Restricting  participation  would  depress  reve-
nues needed by the Treasury, and delay introduction of new services. 

The  FCC  has  repeatedly  found  that  open  competitive  bidding  will  ensure  that 
scarce, valuable spectrum resources are put to the highest and best use. Restricting 
bidding  to  a  limited  class  of  entities  strongly  suggests  that  the  license  may  not  be 
granted  to  the  highest  and  best  use.  It  increases  the  risk  that  spectrum  would  go 
to  entities  incapable  of  putting  it  to  timely,  effective  use.  The  Commission  should 
maintain its policy of rejecting all calls for closed bidding. 

Restricting  eligibility  would  unquestionably  reduce  the  economic  benefits  of  the 
auction.  Proceeds  from  the  700  MHz  auction  will  fund  multiple  programs  for  the 
DTV  transition  and  the  deployment  of  interoperable  communications  systems  for 
public  safety.  By  limiting  eligibility,  the  resulting  reduction  in  competition  will  en-
sure that the spectrum will be auctioned at a price lower than its true market value. 
As  a  result,  the  viability  of  these  valuable  and  necessary  programs  will  be  at  risk. 
Existing carriers have proven track records of designing and deploying highly so-
phisticated  networks.  Every  year  in  its  CMRS  competition  reports,  the  Commission 
has pointed to vigorous competition in the CMR market through the competing net-
works  built  by  Verizon  Wireless  and  our  competitors.  There  is  no  basis  for  barring 
current  providers  from  the  auction;  doing  so  would  deprive  companies  of  the  addi-
tional spectrum they would want to acquire to expand their offering of high quality, 
spectrum-intensive advanced services. 

2. Wholesale Only Requirement. Frontline Wireless has proposed that a portion of 
the  700  MHz  spectrum  be  licensed  subject  to  several  onerous  conditions.  The  first 
of  these  is  that  the  licensee  cannot  use  the  spectrum  itself  but  must  operate  as  a 
wholesale-only  provider.  This  is,  frankly,  an  absurd  requirement.  It  makes  sense 
only if you are trying to foreclose any existing carrier from acquiring the spectrum. 
Verizon Wireless provides both wholesale and retail services, as do many other car-
riers; and the FCC has consistently found that the industry is robustly competitive. 
There is simply no credible basis for the FCC to accept Frontline’s proposal to strip 
the  very  carriers  who  have  built  a  competitive  industry  from  serving  retail  cus-
tomers in the 700 MHz band. 

3.  Open  Access  Requirement.  Frontline  also  proposes  something  it  calls  ‘‘open  ac-
cess.’’  This  term  has  been  the  subject  of  much  discussion  but  little  or  no  definition 
or  specificity.  Frontline  provides  almost  no  meaning  to  this  concept,  other  than 
vague  requirements  that  the  licensee  permit  any  wireless  device  to  connect  to  the 
network, and that the licensee operate solely as a wholesale service provider. Front-
line  claims  that  these  requirements  are  important  components  of  its  proposal  to 
build  public  safety  a  broadband  network.  However,  many  public  safety  agencies 
have  raised  doubts  about  how  Frontline’s  open  access  requirements  would  impact 
them. Moreover, saddling the spectrum with these obligations would reduce interest 
in the spectrum at auction, positioning Frontline to acquire the spectrum at a price 
substantially below market value. 

Frontline’s  request  for  ‘‘open  access’’  should  be  viewed  as  defining  requirements 
for  physical  access  to  existing  networks.  These  requirements  disregard  the  way 
wireless  networks  are  designed  and  operated  to  meet  the  needs  of  subscribers.  On 
Verizon Wireless’ and others’ networks, the cell phone or PDA is in fact part of the 
network.  It  is  constantly  communicating  with  the  network,  and  we  are  responsible 
for  its  operation  under  our  FCC  licenses.  This  is  why  we  put  all  wireless  devices 
through  rigorous  quality  testing.  Further,  and  just  as  importantly,  customers  see 
their service as inclusive of the device they use and have come to expect the carrier 
to ensure its performance. 

Imposing  physical  access  conditions  would  risk  harm  to  the  network  and  under-
mine the quality of service provided to our customers. Moreover, experimenting with 
such  an  uncontrolled  regime  for  a  system  that  is  specifically  designed  to  be  used 
for  public  safety  communications,  as  Frontline  proposes,  would  be  particularly  dan-
gerous.  Frontline’s  plan  contains  no  safeguards  to  ensure  that  customers’  untested 
devices and novel uses of spectrum would not reduce the quality of service provided 
to  public  safety  or  commercial  users,  or  cause  harmful  interference  to  other  users

71 

operating  within  the  licensed  spectrum  or  others  operating  in  adjacent  spectrum. 
For example: 

• E–911  Service  could  be  compromised.  A  mandate  that  carriers  allow  customers 
to  attach  any  device  to  the  network  would  make  it  more  difficult  for  carriers 
to comply with their E–911 obligations. The handsets that customers would at-
tach  to  the  network  would  not  necessarily  be  E–911  capable;  and  even  if  they 
were, the network might not be able to communicate with the handset to deter-
mine the caller’s location. 
• Handset prices will likely increase. Handsets designed to operate with multiple, 
or  all  available,  wireless  networks  will  require  additional  hardware  and  soft-
ware  to  ensure  basic  operability.  Some  applications  may  need  to  be  loaded  in 
multiple  formats.  Think  of  a  computer  that  has  to  be  both  Apple  and  Windows 
capable  and  must  support  game-playing  on  Playstation,  Xbox,  Game  Boy,  and 
Nintendo  platforms,  etc.  Interoperability  has  a  price,  with  very  few  practical 
benefits. You generally use only one network at a time. 

• Harms  to  wireless  users  would  occur.  Because  wireless  devices  share  a  net-
work’s  spectrum  resources,  every  device  has  an  impact  on  the  spectrum  avail-
able  to  other  users.  An  unapproved  device  can  impact  the  network  and  its  ca-
pacity  to  serve  the  maximum  number  of  customers.  It  can  also  cause  inter-
ference  to  other  users,  blocking  their  access  to  the  network.  Wireless  operators 
today  ensure  that  every  device  is  subject  to  rigorous  testing  and  meets  certain 
quality  standards  to  guard  against  these  risks.  An  open  access  regime  would 
deprive operators of that ability and thereby protect their customers. 

4.  Net  Neutrality.  Perhaps  encouraged  by  Frontline’s  proposal,  several  groups 
want  to  seize  on  the  700  MHz  auction  as  a  way  to  impose  broader  ‘‘net  neutrality’’ 
rules  on  wireless  carriers.  They  are  demanding  that  the  FCC  somehow  dictate  net 
neutrality,  even  though  each  of  these  groups  would  appear  to  define  it  in  different 
way.  I  have  the  same  concerns  about  a  broader  net  neutrality  mandate  as  I  do  for 
open  access.  Generally,  proponents  of  the  concept  focus  on  issues  involving  traffic 
routing  and  management  along  proprietary  networks.  If  what  the  proponents  are 
talking  about  are  the  rights  of  users  to  access  the  public  Internet  and  applications 
of  their  choice,  wireless  customers  can  already  do  just  that.  If,  however,  they  want 
to preclude wireless carriers from offering their own value-added products and serv-
ices, or to require wireless carriers to permit customers to download any application 
they  want  onto  their  handsets,  I  have  the  same  fundamental  disagreement.  On  a 
wireless  network,  applications  have  the  potential  to  cause  serious  harm.  For  exam-
ple: 

• The user experience could be compromised. In the wireless context, air interface 
signal-to-noise conditions vary by user with time. More packets can be delivered 
to the user when the signal-to-noise ratio is good than when it’s bad. The wire-
less industry uses sophisticated queuing and scheduling algorithms at each base 
station to optimize throughput by sending packets to users during times of good 
signal-to-noise  conditions.  Would  these  practices  be  precluded?  These  practices 
improve the user experience for all subscribers. 
• Users  could  find  network  access  more  difficult.  In  the  wireless  broadband  con-
text,  users  on-line  within  a  certain  geographic  area  share  the  available  spec-
trum  resource;  therefore,  the  bandwidth  requirements  of  one  user  can  affect 
those  of  all  users  in  the  same  geographic  area.  A  few  users  operating  ‘‘band-
width  hog’’  applications  can  actually  prevent  other  users  from  obtaining  access 
to  the  network.  If  the  wireless  operator  cannot  manage  the  bandwidth  hog  ap-
plications  in  some  principled  way,  it  cannot  achieve  a  fair  allocation  of  the 
available resources for as many subscribers as possible. 
• Just  as  Internet  content  and  applications  vary  in  size,  they  also  vary  in  their 
sensitivity  to  latency,  or  delay.  E-mail  delivery  and  web  searches  are  generally 
not overly sensitive to latency. On the other hand, certain applications are very 
sensitive  to  latency,  and  require  ‘‘fast  lane’’  delivery  of  packets.  An  operator 
must have the flexibility to provide priority transmissions if the quality of serv-
ice requires. 
• Security  risks  would  increase.  Hostile  content  and  applications  are  common  on 
the Internet in the form of viruses and denial of services attacks, among others. 
Network  operators  address  and  deal  with  such  risks  by  filtering  them  out, 
thereby ensuring improved user experiences for all subscribers on-line. 
• Beneficial  content  filters  could  be  jeopardized.  Broadband  networks  can  estab-
lish filters that protect children from adult content, or some computers from any 
specified content. There is no reason why consumers should not be able to sub-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 02, 2012 Jkt 074104 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74104.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

72 

scribe to filters of their own choosing, whether by subject matter or size or point 
of origin, if the technology is available. Again, the network operator would have 
to manage against certain packets to benefit consumers. 

Having spent many years building and operating wireless networks, I strongly be-
lieve  that  open  access  and  net  neutrality  requirements  would  do  a  huge  disservice 
to  wireless  industry  and  our  customers.  Wireless  companies  have  delivered  enor-
mous benefits to the economy and consumers by being free to innovate and differen-
tiate  their  products.  It  is  bad  enough  that  there  is  no  problem  that  could  justify 
such  regulation.  Worse,  imposing  open  access  and  net  neutrality  would  cause  real 
harms  to  one  of  the  Nation’s  most  successful  industries,  to  innovation,  and  to  our 
customers. 
Conclusion 

Verizon  Wireless  urges  that  the  700  MHz  auction  be  held  as  soon  as  possible, 
without  rules  that  foreclose  bidders  or  impose  unfounded  and  ill-advised  require-
ments. The 700 MHz auction, if conducted fairly, and without the sorts of risky and 
counterproductive  conditions  discussed  above,  holds  the  promise  of  raising  billions 
for  the  U.S.  Treasury  while  delivering  the  benefits  of  the  most  advanced  wireless 
technology  to  the  American  public.  There  will  be  plenty  of  winners,  in  the  form  of 
innovation,  job  creation,  economic  growth,  and  increasing  U.S.  global  competitive-
ness. But if we get it wrong, and use this auction as a platform for forcing unjusti-
fied and risky spectrum policy onto the wireless industry, the only losers will be the 
American public.

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Mr. Lynch. 
May I now recognize Mr. Small. 

STATEMENT OF MICHAEL SMALL, CHIEF EXECUTIVE 

OFFICER, CENTENNIAL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION 
Mr.  SMALL.  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  members 
of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  allowing  me  this  opportunity  to 
appear today. 

For  the  last  9  years,  I  have  served  as  the  CEO  of  Centennial 
Communications,  a  regional  provider  of  wireless  and  integrated 
communications services with over 1 million customers across parts 
of six states in the Midwest and South, as well as Puerto Rico and

the U.S. Virgin Islands. Previously, I worked for larger and smaller 
providers of wireline, wireless, and cable TV services. 

At Centennial, we have been in business for almost 20 years, and 
succeed  in  the  competitive  wireless  industry  by  focusing  on  the 
needs  of  customers  in  small  cities  and  rural  markets.  We  get  off 
the  highways  and  provide  coverage  in  communities  often  under-
served  by  national  carriers.  In  many  markets,  like  Paw  Paw, 
Michigan,  or  Eunice,  Louisiana,  we  are  the  only  carrier  with  a  re-
tail  presence.  Centennial’s  well-trained  associates  are  ‘‘the’’  source 
for wireless advice on service and assistance in these markets. 

Yet,  our  business  is  coming  to  a  crossroads.  Consumers  are  now 
demanding  3G  broadband  services.  To  deploy  these  services,  car-
riers like Centennial need more spectrum. 

The  700  MHz  spectrum  is  the  critical  element  to  furthering 
broadband  deployment  of  services  to  rural  America.  With  its  out-
standing  propagation  characteristics,  700  MHz  spectrum  will  help 
bring  wireless  broadband  to  areas  where  terrain,  technology,  and 
economics  make  the  provision  of  wireline  broadband  service  dif-
ficult or impossible. 

The buildout cost differential between existing PCS or AWS spec-
trum  and  700  MHz  should  be  at  least  three  to  one,  making  build-
out in rural America uneconomical without 700 MHz spectrum. 

I would like to address three issues regarding the 700 MHz auc-
tion,  including  the  appropriate  mix  of  band  plans,  the  potentially 
harmful  nature  of  the  proposed  geographic  buildout  mandate,  and 
why additional regulatory encumbrances are counterproductive and 
unnecessary. 

First, with regard to the band plans, Centennial agrees with the 
Commission, that providing a mix of CMA, EA, and REAG licenses 
will  maximize  competition  and  geographic  reach.  We  support  the 
Commission’s  proposal  for  the  lower  700  MHz  band.  In  the  upper 
700 MHz band, Centennial opposes the Frontline plan and strongly 
urges  adoption  of  a  band  plan  that  includes  at  least  one  CMA  li-
cense. 

Licenses  awarded  on  the  basis  of  large  geographic  areas  unrea-
sonably favor large national carriers and handicap regional carriers 
like  Centennial.  Using  the  recently  completed  AWS  auction  as  an 
example,  CMA  licenses  align  well  with  our  existing  U.S.  footprint 
of  8.6  million  POPs.  But,  to  cover  our  territory  with  larger  EA  li-
censes would have forced us to purchase four times as many POPs, 
including  expansion  to  cities  like  Detroit  and  Chicago.  The  result-
ing  cost  increase  of  more  than  $200  million  is  an  insurmountable 
hurdle for a company like Centennial, with under $1 billion in rev-
enue. 

Currently,  carriers  like  Centennial  provide  the  best,  and  some-
times only, service in many small and rural markets. National car-
rier coverage is often limited to major highways in rural areas, like 
I–10 in the Southeast, where Centennial and our roaming partners 
each  have  excellent  coverage.  But,  off  the  interstate,  in  places  like 
Kinder,  Louisiana,  and  Prentiss,  Mississippi,  Centennial  provides 
the  best  coverage.  The  best  way  to  make  sure  that  future  3G  and 
4G  services  make  it  to  rural  America  is  to  allow  regional  carriers 
to compete for spectrum, that spectrum needed to bolster our serv-
ice offerings. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 02, 2012 Jkt 074104 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74104.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

75 

Ensuring  rural  markets  have  comparable  service  to  urban  mar-
kets  is  not  only  in  Centennial’s  customers’  best  interests,  but 
serves  the  public  interest  by  providing  robust  networks  for  local 
public  safety  and  for  customers  of  national  providers  who  roam  in 
our area. 

Second,  Centennial  shares  the  Commission’s  desire  for  wide-
spread  provision  of  mobile  wireless  services,  but  we  oppose  the 
Commission’s  proposal  to  impose  a  geographic  buildout  mandate 
based  on  arbitrary  deadlines.  Centennial  is  not  alone  in  this  view, 
and  we  agree  with  many  commentators  who  have  demonstrated 
that  arbitrary  geographic  buildout  rules  are  contrary  to  this  objec-
tive, and will undoubtedly chill interest in the auction, particularly 
for licenses that include large rural areas. 

And,  finally,  Centennial  opposes  unnecessary,  untested,  and 
often self-serving proposals to encumber all or part of the 700 MHz 
band  with  regulatory  obligations  such  as  wholesale-only  business 
obligations or open access or net neutrality requirements. 

The  Commission’s  nearly  15-year  evolution  toward  a  flexible-use 
policy  has  been  a  tremendous  success.  These  poison-pill  proposals, 
including  Frontline’s,  should  be  recognized  for  what  they  are  and 
rejected as solutions in search of a problem if the tremendous suc-
cess  of  the  AWS  auction  is  to  be  replicated  and  the  huge  success 
and innovation of the wireless industry is to be perpetuated. 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Committee 

today. I look forward to answering your questions. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Small follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL SMALL, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, 

CENTENNIAL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION 

Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Stevens, and members of the Committee, thank 
you for the opportunity to testify at today’s hearing. I am Michael Small, and I serve 
as  the  CEO  of  Centennial  Communications  Corporation,  headquartered  in  Wall, 
New  Jersey.  I  also  serve  on  the  Executive  Committee  of  CTIA—The  Wireless  Asso-
ciation. 

Centennial is a provider of regional wireless and integrated communications serv-
ices in the United States and the Caribbean. In the United States, we operate GSM- 
based  wireless  networks  in  parts  of  six  states  in  the  Midwest  and  South.  Our  mid-
western  service  area  covers  parts  of  Michigan,  Ohio,  and  Indiana,  including  mid- 
sized cities such as Grand Rapids, Lansing, South Bend, and Ft. Wayne. Our south-
ern  service  area  covers  parts  of  Texas,  Louisiana,  and  Mississippi,  including  mid- 
sized  cities  such  as  Beaumont,  Lafayette,  Alexandria,  and  Natchez.  Centennial’s 
Caribbean business owns and operates CDMA-based wireless networks that provide 
both mobility and residential broadband services in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands.  In  total,  Centennial  serves  approximately  1.1  million  wireless  subscribers. 
We  also  operate  a  fiber-based  CLEC  in  Puerto  Rico,  bringing  state-of-the-art,  high- 
bandwidth solutions to many Fortune 500 companies with operations there. 

Since  our  creation  in  the  1980s,  Centennial  has  focused  on  serving  small  cities 
and  rural  America.  Today,  we  are  successful  in  a  highly  competitive  marketplace 
because  we  are  intensely  focused  on  serving  the  local  needs  of  the  people  who  live, 
work, and play in our small city and rural markets. To succeed, we must serve these 
regional areas much better than our national competitors. 

At  the  outset,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  for  its  work  on  the  DTV  Act, 
the  legislation  that  made  the  700  megahertz  auction  possible  by  facilitating  the 
DTV transition. It is critically important that the Federal Communications Commis-
sion  meet  the  auction  schedule  set  forth  by  Congress  in  the  DTV  Act,  and  that  it 
promptly issue simple and straight-forward service and technical rules that will en-
sure  that  the  wireless  industry  has  the  spectrum  it  needs  to  continue  to  innovate 
and  serve  the  needs  of  more  than  230  million  existing  wireless  subscribers,  as  well 
as the tens of millions of new subscribers that the industry is projected to add over 
the next several years.

76 

At Centennial, we view the 700 megahertz auction as an opportunity to augment 
our spectrum holdings in a way that will enhance our ability to bring robust, high- 
quality broadband service to our customers. The 700 megahertz spectrum is ‘‘rural- 
front’’  spectrum  with  propagation  characteristics  that  make  it  orders  of  magnitude 
more  efficient  than  the  recently  auctioned  AWS  spectrum  for  serving  very  rural 
areas. The 700 megahertz spectrum will help us to make wireless broadband access 
available  in  areas  where  terrain,  technology,  and  economics  render  the  provision  of 
wireline broadband access difficult or impossible. 
I would like to address three issues, including: 
• the  appropriate  mix  of  band  plans  for  the  60  megahertz  intended  for  auction 
• the harmful nature of the proposed geographic buildout mandate; and 
• why  additional  regulatory  encumbrances  are  counterproductive  and  unneces-

to commercial service providers; 

sary. 

The Commission’s Service Rules Should Provide for a Mix of Licensing Op-

portunities 

Centennial  agrees  with  the  Commission’s  conclusion  that  ‘‘by  providing  a  mix  of 
CMA,  EA,  and  REAG  licenses  in  the  700  MHz  Commercial  Services  spectrum,  we 
provide  a  more  balanced  set  of  initial  licensing  opportunities  that  provide  an  effec-
tive means of access to spectrum especially in rural areas, while effectively meeting 
other Commission goals.’’ Centennial, whose licensed service areas are regional and 
often  rural  in  nature,  applauds  the  Commission’s  commitment  to  providing  con-
tinuing  opportunity  for  regional  carriers  to  expand  their  product  offerings  to  cus-
tomers  living,  working  and  traveling  outside  of  the  large  metropolitan  areas  of  the 
country. 

The  existing  band  plan  for  the  lower  700  megahertz  band  divides  the  spectrum 
into  five  blocks:  three  12  megahertz  paired  blocks  (consisting  of  two  6  megahertz 
segments  each)  and  two  unpaired  6  megahertz  blocks.  One  of  these  12  megahertz 
blocks and one of the 6 megahertz unpaired blocks have already been auctioned. In 
a prior notice, the Commission announced a preference to retain this band plan be-
cause of its mix of geographic market sizes and spectrum allocations. 

The upper 700 megahertz commercial services band plan now consists of 30 mega-
hertz  of  spectrum  currently  divided  into  two  blocks:  a  10-megahertz  paired  block 
consisting  of  two  5-megahertz  segments  (C  Block)  and  a  20-megahertz  paired  block 
consisting  of  two  10-megahertz  segments  (D  Block).  In  the  700  MHz  Commercial 
Services  Notice,  the  Commission  sought  comment  on  the  band  plan  and  whether  it 
should  reconfigure  the  size  of  these  spectrum  blocks.  As  a  result,  five  proposals  for 
the upper 700 megahertz band are now before the Commission. 

To  ensure  the  optimal  mix  of  licenses,  Centennial  strongly  urges  adoption  of  a 
band plan for the upper 700 megahertz band that includes at least one CMA license. 
Licenses  awarded  on  the  basis  of  large  geographic  areas  favor  the  large,  national 
wireless  carriers  and  handicap  regional  and  rural  carriers,  like  Centennial,  whose 
service areas tend to be defined by CMA boundaries. This is not an issue of favoring 
small  companies  in  the  spectrum  policy;  rather,  it  is  an  acknowledgement  that  an 
auction with only large licenses effectively forecloses participation by small carriers, 
while  an  auction  with  CMA-sized  licenses  permits  carriers  of  all  sizes  an  oppor-
tunity to compete. 

From the beginning of telephone service, the large telecommunications companies 
have focused on metropolitan areas with smaller companies providing service to the 
small  and  rural  markets  of  the  country.  Data  provided  to  the  Commission  by  the 
national carriers shows that they place their emphasis on high-density markets. Ten 
years  after  the  original  PCS  licenses  were  granted,  national  carriers  had  covered 
less  than  70  percent  of  their  MTA  POPs  in  states  like  Alaska,  Arkansas,  Kansas, 
Mississippi,  and  New  Mexico.  Even  when  constructing  in  less-populated  areas,  the 
national carriers tend to build along major thoroughfares without venturing far into 
the  less  populated  hamlets.  For  example,  Centennial  and  its  roaming  partners  all 
have  excellent  coverage  along  major  thoroughfares  like  I–10  in  Louisiana,  but  off 
the interstate, it is companies like Centennial that are providing coverage in places 
like  Kinder,  Louisiana  and  Prentiss,  Mississippi.  Through  roaming  arrangements 
with  Centennial  and  other  carriers  like  us,  customers  of  nationwide  carriers  are 
able  to  enjoy  all  of  their  regular  wireless  features  when  business  or  pleasure  takes 
them to these remote areas. 

In addition, Centennial frequently is the only carrier to have a retail presence in 
these  markets.  In  places  like  Paw  Paw,  Michigan;  Peru,  Indiana;  and  Eunice,  Lou-
isiana,  we  operate  company-owned  retail  outlets  for  wireless  service  that  are  not 
merely  points  of  sale,  but  also  full-service  operations  designed  to  meet  all  of  the

needs  of  our  customers,  including  bill  payment,  customer  support,  and  post-sale 
technical assistance. 

To  roll-out  high-speed  broadband  wireless  services,  regional  carriers  like  Centen-
nial need additional spectrum to enable the delivery of these new and exciting capa-
bilities.  If  the  only  additional  spectrum  available  is  limited  to  blocks  of  large  geo-
graphic service areas, it will be uneconomical for Centennial to acquire the spectrum 
we  need  because  we  would  be  forced  to  vastly  expand  our  footprint  rather  than  fo-
cusing  on  improving  services  in  our  existing  territory.  For  example,  using  the  li-
cense areas defined in Auction 66, acquiring spectrum covering our existing domes-
tic  footprint  of  8.6  million  POPs  would  require  the  purchase  of  41  CMAs  with  9.7 
million  POPs.  To  cover  the  same  footprint  on  an  EA  basis  would  require  18  EAs 
with  over  34.3  million  POPs.  This  is  an  insurmountable  hurdle  for  a  company  the 
size of Centennial. 

By  bidding  for  CMA-based  licenses,  we  can  continue  the  important  work  of  pro-
viding modern, state-of-the-art service in the less-populated and remote areas of the 
country. In doing so, we can ensure the continued and expanded availability of mod-
ern wireless communications in the markets we serve, benefiting not only those who 
live  there,  but  everyone  who  travels  to  those  areas  as  well.  Ensuring  this  level  of 
service  in  small  markets  creates  economic  and  educational  opportunities  for  those 
who live there, consistent with the Nation’s long-standing commitment to Universal 
Service. 

The most logical way for the Commission to ensure that the service rules provide 
for CMA licenses in the upper band is to reject the proposal submitted by Frontline. 
As I will discuss later in my testimony, the conditions sought by Frontline are inap-
propriate  and  would  needlessly  constrain  the  number  of  parties  likely  to  compete 
at auction for the spectrum in the upper band. Frontline’s proposal is not necessary 
to  meet  the  needs  of  public  safety,  and  it  inappropriately  and  unlawfully  converts 
public  safety  spectrum,  licensed  to  a  qualified  public  safety  organization,  into  a  re-
source  that  Frontline  plans  to  use  to  provide  for  profit  commercial  service.  By  dis-
missing  Frontline’s  proposal,  the  Commission  can  adopt  a  plan  that  supports  CMA 
licenses with paired spectrum in the upper 700 megahertz band. 
The  Commission  Should  Not  Impose  a  Geographic  Build-Out  Requirement 

on 700 MHz Licensees 

Centennial  shares  the  Commission’s  desire  for  widespread  provision  of  mobile 
wireless  services,  and  as  our  long  history  demonstrates,  we  are  firmly  committed 
to serving rural markets. Nonetheless, we have serious concerns about the Commis-
sion’s  proposal  to  impose  a  geographic  buildout  mandate  based  on  arbitrary  dead-
lines. 

From where I work in New Jersey, I cannot effectively and do not dictate on-the- 
ground  investment  decisions  in  Pineville,  Louisiana,  or  Angola,  Indiana.  I  need  my 
associates  in  the  field  to  determine  the  best  and  most  economical  way  to  meet  the 
needs  of  our  customers.  A  build-out  requirement  that  limits  our  ability  to  focus  on 
places  where  demand  and  need  are  greatest  could  in  fact  have  the  opposite  of  its 
intended  effect—consumers  might  see  lower  quality  and  less  service.  Being  forced 
to build to meet arbitrary deadlines might force companies like Centennial to make 
decisions to purchase equipment based on what is available now, rather than on the 
basis  of  what  might  be  available  in  the  near  future.  As  a  result,  many  consumers 
will  have  to  wait  to  enjoy  full  3G  and  ultimately  4G  technology.  Further,  if  we  fail 
to  meet  these  arbitrary  deadlines,  we  could  be  forced  to  return  spectrum  that  we 
have  every  intention  of  using  in  the  future.  This  outcome  would  hurt  Centennial, 
and it cannot help consumers. 

Less  than  3  years  ago,  the  Commission  considered  the  issue  of  performance  re-
quirements  in  the  Rural  Wireless  Order  and  affirmed  the  current  trend  in  favor  of 
substantial  service.  The  Commission  rejected  calls  to  revert  back  to  geographic-  or 
population-based buildout requirements and instead concluded that mandated build-
out was economically counterproductive and inconsistent with a reliance on market 
forces.  Commissioner  Copps  echoed  this  point  in  his  separate  statement  accom-
panying  the  Further  Notice,  saying  that  ‘‘[W]e  also  need  to  make  sure  that  we  do 
not  unfairly  punish  licensees—especially  in  rural  areas—who  cannot  engage  in  ag-
gressive build-out for perfectly good economic reasons.’’ 

The notion that every hertz of licensed spectrum must be put into use throughout 
each  licensed  area  does  not  make  sound  economic  sense.  A  policy  of  government- 
imposed,  forced  investment  would  result  in  uneconomic  and  unsustainable  deploy-
ment. The stringency of the proposed build-out requirement is even more objection-
able when coupled with the proposed cap on CETC support proposed recently by the 
Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service.

There are numerous examples of Universal Service being used to extend networks 
to  areas  that  would  be  bypassed  without  access  to  universal  service  support.  In 
some  cases,  wireless  carriers  have  used  high  cost  universal  service  support  to  de-
liver service to areas that previously had no access to telecommunications—wireless 
or wireline. 

Universal  Service  support  has  been  important  to  Centennial  in  places  like  Lou-
isiana. Centennial used support from the Universal Service program to bring service 
to  two  Concordia  Parish  communities—Shaw  and  Blackhawk—that  did  not  have 
any  telephone  service  at  all  until  we  made  it  available  a  little  more  than  2  years 
ago. 

Centennial also used support from the Universal Service Fund to deploy facilities 
that  performed  reliably  during  and  after  Hurricane  Katrina.  The  resiliency  of  the 
Centennial network allowed us to provide critical recovery services to other wireless 
providers whose networks failed, the U.S. Coast Guard, FEMA, and the Red Cross, 
and  to  help  those  in  shelters  to  call  and  text  message  loved  ones  to  let  them  know 
they were safe. 

The  proposed  cap  on  CETC  access  to  universal  service  support  threatens  the 
progress  that  has  been  made  in  bringing  high-quality,  reliable  wireless  service  to 
rural  America,  and  it  would  do  harm  to  the  rural  communities  Centennial  serves 
or aspires to serve. Neither the proposed cap nor the proposed geographic build-out 
requirement serve the interests of rural consumers, and neither should be adopted. 
The  Commission  Should  Not  Impose  Additional  Regulatory  Encumbrances 

on 700 MHz Bidders 

The  Commission’s  nearly  15-year  evolution  toward  a  flexible  use  policy  has  been 
a tremendous success, and there is no evidence to suggest that a return to the com-
mand-and-control  spectrum  regulation  of  the  1980s  is  warranted.  Accordingly,  Cen-
tennial opposes unnecessary, untested, and often self-serving proposals to encumber 
all  or  parts  of  the  700  megahertz  band  with  regulatory  obligations  such  as  whole-
sale-only  business  obligations  or  ‘‘open  access’’  or  ‘‘net  neutrality’’  requirements. 
These  ‘‘poison  pill’’  proposals  should  be  recognized  for  what  they  are  and  rejected. 
The  proposals  by  Frontline,  the  Ad  Hoc  Public  Interest  Spectrum  Coalition,  and 
the  Media  Access  Project  to  impose  an  ‘‘open  access’’  regime  would  require  700 
megahertz  licensees  to  enable  any  customer  to  attach  ‘‘any  compatible  device’’  sub-
ject  to  minimal  do-no-harm  rules  and  to  permit  such  devices  to  reach  any  website, 
post  any  information,  provide  any  service  and  access  or  provide  any  application, 
without  regard  to  the  need  for  a  carrier  to  manage  its  network  efficiently  and  for 
the  benefit  of  its  entire  customer  base.  The  Ad  Hoc  proposal  also  advocates  for  a 
wholesale-only  business  plan  with  an  exception  for  the  provision  of  retail  service 
through a structurally separate affiliate, subject to further limits if the licensee cur-
rently holds spectrum in the market. 

These proposals are deeply misguided. As CTIA observed in response to the Skype 
petition  seeking  wireless  Carterfone  and  ‘‘open  access’’  policies,  ‘‘exposing  wireless 
networks to untested mobile handsets and applications would degrade network per-
formance,  create  harmful  interference,  prevent  carrier  compliance  with  important 
social  policy  obligations,  and  open  networks  to  greater  security  threats.’’  Carrier 
management  and  certification  of  phones  must  be  permitted  because  these  steps  en-
sure  that  network  elements  work  in  tandem  with  handsets  to  provide  the  highest 
quality  voice  and  data  services.  Moreover,  in  order  to  maximize  spectral  efficiency, 
carriers must be able to manage the use of applications that require large amounts 
of  bandwidth  or  near-constant  connection  to  the  network,  such  as  streaming  media 
and peer-to-peer services. 

There is no economic basis to impose open access or other intrusive forms of regu-
latory  intervention  on  the  wireless  industry.  Indeed,  in  light  of  the  competitiveness 
of the U.S. mobile wireless service and equipment markets, which will only become 
more competitive as a result of the 700 megahertz auction, the Ad Hoc proposal rep-
resents  the  very  definition  of  a  solution  in  search  of  a  problem.  It,  along  with  the 
Frontline  and  Media  Access  Project  proposals,  should  be  rejected  and  the  govern-
ment  should  refrain  from  imposing  any  single  business  plan—including  those  that 
are  novel  and  untested—or  any  other  departure  from  the  Commission’s  successful 
flexible use policies on the 700 megahertz spectrum. Instead, the auction should pro-
ceed with few, if any, encumbrances, and the market should determine which busi-
ness  plans  and  competitors  will  prevail.  The  Commission  must  avoid  calls  to  sub-
stitute  its  judgment  for  that  of  the  marketplace  if  the  success  of  the  AWS  auction 
is to be replicated.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Com-
mittee, and I thank you and your colleagues for your attention to the 700 megahertz 
auction  process.  With  proper  execution,  the  700  megahertz  auction  holds  great 
promise for Centennial, for other wireless carriers, and, most importantly, for Amer-
ica’s consumers. 

I look forward to answering any questions you may have. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Dr. Sarva? 

STATEMENT OF AMOL R. SARVA, CEO, TXTBL 

Dr.  SARVA.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Ste-
vens,  and  distinguished  mmbers  of  the  Committee,  for  the  oppor-
tunity  to  address  a  critically  important  topic  for  the  future  of  the 
wireless industry. 

As  a  leader  of  a  group  of  wireless  entrepreneurs  and  myself 
among  the  founders  of  one  of  the  prominent  companies  in  this  in-
dustry, I’m here to bring a different perspective. My colleagues and 
I have taken new ideas to market. We’ve built things from scratch. 
We’ve  created  thousands  of  jobs  and  billions  of  dollars  in  value. 
We’ve  even  done  this  in  collaboration  with  the  ‘‘big  guys.’’  Virgin 
Mobile  was  one  of  my  first  ventures.  It  has  over  a  billion  dollars 
in  revenues  today,  and  this  year  it’s  gone—it’s  filed  to  go  public. 
I’m  currently  working  on  my  third  wireless  startup,  Txtbl.  I’d 
love  to  tell  you  all  about  it,  but  today  I’ll  focus  on  what  you  can 
do to make more stories like mine possible in America. 

Fifteen of us wrote a letter, last week, to FCC Chairman Martin 
in support of an open access ‘‘E Block.’’ We believe the wireless in-
dustry  is  full  of  opportunities  for  innovation.  There  are  billion-dol-
lar  ideas  all  over  the  place.  But  today,  the  large  wireless  carriers 
have  the  keys  to  the  castle.  Getting  your  innovation  into  the  na-
tional  market  is  difficult  and  a  lot  more  time-consuming  than  it 
should  be.  These  negotiations  add  months  or  years.  They  make  it 
harder  to  raise  initial  capital.  They  force  you  to  bet  big,  early,  in-
stead of betting small, the trial-and-error approach essential to the 
entrepreneurial process. 

An open-access framework in part of the 700 MHz band, by con-
trast,  would  enable  innovation  at  Internet  speed.  My  own  experi-
ence  at  Virgin  Mobile  is  a  good  example.  My  colleague  John 
Tantum was the Founding President, and I was the second person 
he hired. 

Virgin  is  a  success  story,  but  it  was  risky  in  the  early  days.  We 
spent  nearly  2  years  traveling  around  to  all  the  carriers  to  see  if 
anyone would deal with us. In general, the answer was no. And at 
numerous  points,  I  thought  we  were  finished.  By  far,  the  scarcest 
commodity in this process was network access. It was far easier to 
raise  capital.  Once  the  network  deal  was  done,  we  had  offers  for 
hundreds of millions of additional investment. 

In  the  end,  only  Sprint,  one  of  the  lagging  large  players,  was 
willing  to  deal  with  us.  And  all  this  with  the  high  profile  backers 
and major capital that Virgin had provided. The young Steve Jobs, 
despite  all  of  his  visionary  ideas,  would  never  have  had  a  chance. 
Even  still,  we  had  to  make  compromises  to  get  a  deal  done  with 
Sprint.  We  agreed  to  market  a  prepaid  product  that  would  not  di-
rectly  compete  with  Sprint’s  contract  plans.  Unsurprisingly,  the

door  to  new  ideas  is  only  open  when  you  serve  the  network  part-
ner’s self-interests directly. 

So for much of what the typical marketing departments required 
of  us  the  engineering  departments  of  carriers  get  their  say,  too. 
Only approved devices or applications are permitted, lest one is un-
safe  for  the  network.  It’s  a  reasonable  constraint.  But  the  U.S.  op-
erators are notorious for running the longest and most difficult cer-
tification processes in the world, around 9 months for a new device. 
These days, it can take only 3 months to design a new device from 
scratch, but 9 months to certify it. Top-class carriers in other coun-
tries  around  the  world  need  much  less  time,  sometimes  just  a  few 
weeks.  Big  device  makers  have  told  me  this  privately;  they 
wouldn’t say it here. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  carriers  seem  to  get  their  devices  done 
faster  than  their  partner’s  devices,  ours.  With  one  carrier,  we 
changed  the  ring  tones  on  the  phone  that  had  already  been  ap-
proved,  and  were  told  this  would  require  a  45-day  recertification 
process. 

And  the  marketing  department  gets  a  vote  here,  too.  You  need 
their  authorization  to  even  submit  a  device.  I  think  carriers  some-
times confuse ‘‘safe for the network’’ and ‘‘safe for the bottom line.’’ 
The  old  Ma  Bell  monopoly  used  the  same  line  to  keep  competition 
and  innovation  out  for  years.  When  the  FCC  finally  called  their 
bluff,  consumers  got  inventions,  like  the  fax  machine,  the  cordless 
phone, the modem, and billions of dollars in economic growth. 

In  closing,  as  entrepreneurs  we  are  pragmatic.  We  are  not  here 
asking  for  changes  regarding  existing  spectrum.  It’s  out  there.  We 
want  to  open  a  portion—10  MHz—of  the  upcoming  auction,  less 
than 3 percent of the licensed mobile spectrum. Here’s why. It’ll be 
a sandbox for entrepreneurs. I can tell you this, my colleagues and 
I  will  be  out  there  creating  new  services  in  spectrum  like  this. 
‘‘Open  access’’  means  three  things.  We  think  it  has  a  clear  mean-
ing. Number one, open devices. And, number two, open services. It 
means  the  freedom  to  connect  any  compatible  device  with  pub-
lished  safety  rules  that  let  users  access  any  complying  device  or 
service.  And,  number  three,  an  open  auction,  requiring  the  license 
holder to auction off a portion of network capacity through an open 
and transparent auction mechanism. That’s the market at work. 

Finally, we applaud Congress and the Commission for paving the 
way with the DTV transition. Now is the chance to capture the up-
side  by  setting  aside  a  portion  of  the  public’s  airwaves  for  use  by 
the  public—innovators,  startups,  entrepreneurs.  Broadband,  the 
mobile, Internet, next-generation wireless, we’ve been talking a lot 
about  it,  and  they’re  all  coming  soon.  Let’s  set  up  America  to  lead 
the way. 

Thank you very much.

I. Background 

Thank you Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Stevens, and distinguished Members 
of  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to  address  the  Committee  on  a  topic  that  I 
see  as  critically  important  to  the  future  of  the  wireless  industry  in  America.  I  am 
here  today  as  a  leader  of  the  Wireless  Founders  Coalition  for  Innovation,  which  is

companies  that  now  generate  billions  of  dollars  of  revenue  and  have  created  thou-
sands of jobs. We have brought innovation to the wireless industry by creating new 
business  models,  launching  new  services,  and  addressing  pressing  consumer  needs 
that were previously overlooked by the large wireless carriers. 

I  am  what  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  a  serial  entrepreneur.  Currently  I  am  Co- 
Founder  and  CEO  of  Txtbl,  a  startup  wireless  company  based  in  New  York  which 
is  just  leaving  the  ‘‘garage  stage’’  and  closing  its  first  round  of  venture  financing. 
I would like to say more about Txtbl, but the U.S. Senate is no place for free adver-
tising and besides we are still in ‘‘stealth mode.’’ Let’s just say for now that we have 
ambitious  plans  to  change  the  way  millions  of  Americans  communicate.  This  is  my 
third wireless startup. In 2000, I was among the first four team members of Virgin 
Mobile USA, my first wireless venture. The first and most successful mobile virtual 
network  operator  (MVNO)  in  the  United  States,  Virgin  Mobile  pioneered  pre-paid 
calling plans and has made wireless service accessible to millions of customers—es-
pecially younger people, lower income and low-credit people and ethnic minorities— 
who  were  previously  underserved  by  the  major  operators.  In  just  the  5  years  since 
our  launch,  Virgin  Mobile  has  gone  from  zero  to  nearly  5  million  customers  and 
achieved  over  $1  billion  in  revenues.  It  recently  filed  for  its  initial  public  offering. 
In  addition  to  my  entrepreneurial  experience,  I  was  also  a  management  consultant 
with McKinsey & Company, where I provided strategic advice to large telecommuni-
cations  companies.  I  attended  New  York  City  public  schools  including  Stuyvesant 
High School, received my B.A. in Economics and Philosophy from Columbia Univer-
sity and my Ph.D. from Stanford University in Cognitive Science. 

Other  members  of  our  Coalition  are  also  responsible  for  a  number  of  ‘‘firsts’’  in 

the U.S. wireless market. For example:

wireless services. 

Additionally,  I  want  to  emphasize  that  several  other  very  successful  and  ambi-
tious  entrepreneurs  have  shared  their  support  for  this  approach  with  us  in  private 
as colleagues, but are stifled from articulating these views publicly for fear of repris-
als  by  the  large  carriers  who  control  access  to  national  wireless  networks  today.  I 
can sympathize with their position. I’ve been there too. 
II. Executive Summary 

Last  week  the  Wireless  Founders  Coalition  for  Innovation  wrote  a  letter  to  FCC 
Chairman Martin in support of an Open Access E Block, as described in Frontline’s 
proposal.  We  believe  the  wireless  industry  is  ripe  with  opportunities  for  innovation 
and  economic  growth,  but  the  large  wireless  carriers  currently  act  as  gatekeepers 
to  block  or  deter  many  of  these  opportunities.  From  firsthand  experience  we  know 
that  negotiating  with  the  large  carriers  for  access  to  their  networks  can  be  a  dif-
ficult  and  time-consuming  process  that  can  add  months  if  not  years  to  the  launch 
of  a  new  venture  and  hinder  the  ‘‘trial-and-error’’  process  intrinsic  to  the  entrepre-

neurial  process.  An  Open  Access  framework,  by  contrast,  would  enable  innovation 
at ‘‘Internet speed.’’ 

My  personal  experience  working  with  the  large  carriers  as  an  MVNO  is  instruc-
tive  on  these  points.  Virgin  Mobile  USA  was  successful  in  spite  of  a  huge  number 
of hurdles raised by the wireless incumbents. We almost failed to get a network deal 
with any carrier. We almost failed to navigate the arduous device certification proc-
ess.  Who  knows  how  many  other  ventures  have  failed  to  pass  through  the  ‘‘star 
chamber’’  of  the  wireless  incumbents’  technical  and  business  requirements  proc-
esses? 

As  entrepreneurs  we  are  not  only  visionaries,  we  are  pragmatists.  We  know  it  is 
difficult  too  for  the  FCC  to  force  the  large  carriers  to  open  up  their  existing  net-
works retroactively. Nor do we ask the FCC to apply Open Access rules to the entire 
700  MHz  band.  However,  we  think  it  is  eminently  reasonable  for  the  FCC  to  des-
ignate  a  single  10  MHz  block  in  the  upcoming  auction—a  small  fraction  of  the  700 
MHz  spectrum  allocated  to  commercial  use—as  a  sandbox  for  entrepreneurs  or  an 
incubation  tank  where  young,  fragile  ideas  have  a  chance  to  live.  We  applaud  the 
Commission  for  paving  the  way  for  the  DTV  transition  and  freeing  this  valuable 
spectrum  for  new  and  exciting  services.  We  believe,  however,  that  this  effort  will 
have  been  wasted  if  it  does  not  create  opportunities  for  entrepreneurs  to  freely  ex-
plore new ideas, services, and business models. 

The 700 MHz auction could prove to be a pivotal event in the history of the wire-
less  industry,  marking  the  transition  to  the  age  of  the  ‘‘wireless  Internet’’.  But  this 
will  only  happen  if  the  FCC  makes  the  right  decisions,  if  it  seizes  the  entrepre-
neurial  opportunity  and  gives  the  American  people  a  chance  to  participate  in  the 
upside from a new and improved approach to wireless policy. 
III. Protecting Network Harm vs. Prohibiting Network Uses 

For  decades  prior  to  the  FCC’s  seminal  Carterfone  decision,  consumers  were  pro-
hibited  from  attaching  any  device  to  the  telephone  network  unless  it  was  expressly 
sanctioned  (and  sold)  by  Ma’  Bell.  Basically,  the  phone  company  kept  competition 
at bay by arguing that it couldn’t keep phone service running without ‘‘absolute con-
trol’’  over  the  network.  Finally,  in  I968,  the  FCC  called  their  bluff,  and  said  that 
so  long  as  a  manufacturer  shows  that  its  device  won’t  harm  the  network,  there’s 
no reason to keep it out of the hands of the public. As a result, we got the fax ma-
chine,  the  answering  machine,  the  modem,  and  billions  upon  billions  of  dollars  of 
new economic productivity. 

Yet  today,  wireless  carriers  control  subscribers’  wireless  devices  much  as  AT&T 
once controlled the wireline experience. One can get a sense of the operators’ propri-
etary  control  over  the  networks  by  looking  at  the  restrictions  they  place  on  their 
retail  customers.  By  way  of  example,  here  is  an  excerpt  from  the  Terms  of  Service 
that  currently  apply  to  Verizon  Wireless’s  data  services  (emphasis  included  in  the 
original): 

Data Plans and Features 
Data  Plans  and  Features 
(such  as  NationalAccess,  BroadbandAccess, 
GlobalAccess,  Push  to  Talk,  and  certain  VZEmail  services)  may  ONLY  be  used 
with  wireless  devices  for  the  following  purposes:  (i)  Internet  browsing;  (ii)  e- 
mail;  and  (iii)  intranet  access  (including  access  to  corporate  intranets,  email, 
and  individual  productivity  applications  like  customer  relationship  manage-
ment,  sales  force,  and  field  service  automation).  The  Data  Plans  and  Features 
MAY  NOT  be  used  for  any  other  purpose.  Examples  of  prohibited  uses  include, 
without  limitation,  the  following:  (i)  continuous  uploading,  downloading  or 
streaming  of  audio  or  video  programming  or  games;  (ii)  server  devices  or  host 
computer applications, including, but not limited to, web camera posts or broad-
casts,  automatic  data  feeds,  automated  machine-to-machine  connections  or  peer- 
to-peer  (P2P)  file  sharing;  or  (iii)  as  a  substitute  or  backup  for  private  lines  or 
dedicated  data  connections.  This  means,  by  way  of  example  only,  that  checking 
e-mail, surfing the Internet, downloading legally acquired songs, and/or visiting 
corporate intranets is permitted, but downloading movies using P2P file sharing 
services  and/or  redirecting  television  signals  for  viewing  on  laptops  is  prohib-
ited.  A  person  engaged  in  prohibited  uses,  continuously  for  1  hour,  could  typi-
cally  use  100  to  200  MBs,  or,  if  engaged  in  prohibited  uses  for  10  hours  a  day, 
7 days a week, could use more than 5 GBs in a month. 

As  you  can  see,  Verizon  spills  quite  a  bit  of  ink  telling  users  what  they  are  not 
allowed to do using their wireless data connections. You may use your wireless con-
nection for simple e-mail or web browsing, or corporate applications but not for ‘‘any 
other  purpose.’’  Not  for  instant  messaging.  Not  for  Voice  over  IP.  Not  for  Internet 
video. Not for downloading games. Not for any other lawful consumer Internet appli-

cation invented in the past 15 years, really. Customers are on notice that using the 
network  in  lawful  but  non-approved  ways  puts  them  at  risk  of  having  their  service 
terminated. 

Like the old AT&T monopoly, wireless carriers argue that unless they dictate ex-
actly  how  and  with  what  device  a  consumer  uses  the  wireless  network,  it  will  all 
come  tumbling  down.  Indeed,  in  response  to  the  Coalition’s  call  for  an  open  access 
network  on  the  E  Block,  one  of  the  incumbent  carriers  responded  that  just  four 
Slingboxes can take down a cell site. But is a Slingbox, or any other device designed 
to allow consumers to remotely watch video, inherently ‘‘unsafe’’? And are other pro-
hibited  services—like  VoIP  or  free  text-messaging  services—inherently  harmful  to 
the network? Of course not. 

Instead,  like  any  use  of  the  network,  some  applications  may  make  more  use  of 
the  network  than  others,  and  regardless  of  the  use,  some  consumers  will  use  the 
network more intensively than others. This is not a new problem. Carriers deal with 
the issue of voice capacity by charging for minutes of use on the network. Customers 
who use lots of minutes pay more than those who do not, and the price mechanism 
gives  customers  an  incentive  to  ration  their  usage.  Equally  important,  the  pricing 
mechanism gives carriers an incentive to increase capacity so that they can generate 
more  minutes  and  hence  more  revenue.  What  if  carriers  simply  charged  data  users 
for  the  amount  of  capacity  they  use,  just  as  they  charge  voice  users  for  minutes  of 
use?  In  that  case,  streaming  video  users  would  pay  more  for  using  more  network 
capacity  and,  if  the  price  was  too  high,  they  might  reduce  their  use  of  streaming 
video applications. 

Carriers also argue that they need absolute control over the consumer experience, 
lest the consumer should stumble upon a device or use that provides a lesser quality 
or otherwise different experience than that offered by the carrier. But if a consumer 
wishes  to  use  a  free  instant  messaging  service,  instead  of  the  carrier’s  own  paid 
messaging  service,  how  is  that  a  ‘‘harm’’  to  the  network?  It  simply  means  that  the 
consumer  is  free  to  make  their  own  decision  as  to  a  tradeoff  between  price,  quality 
and a host of other variables. Maybe the consumer is an ‘‘early adopter’’ who is will-
ing  to  try  out  a  new  product  on  the  leading  edge  of  technology.  Early  adopters  are 
notoriously willing to accept tradeoffs in product quality in order to have the ‘‘new-
est thing’’. Fortunately for the rest of us, it is these early users who allow innovative 
products to ‘‘cross the chasm’’ from laboratory to the mass market. 

Simply put, there is no reason, apart from commercial self-interest, why a carrier 
needs  to  ban  streaming  video  devices,  webcams,  Voice  over  IP,  or  any  other  such 
application.  These  prohibitions  are  akin  to  telling  subscribers  what  conversations 
they can or cannot have on their mobile phones (e.g., quick chats about what to pick 
up for dinner are OK, long conversations with old friends are not). The only devices 
and uses that shouldn’t be allowed are those that would actually harm the network. 
For example, a device that would operate above acceptable power limits would cause 
interference to other users, and certainly it is reasonable for a carrier to ban it. But 
particularly as we move to an all-IP wireless world, there is no inherent reason that 
one byte of traffic should be allowed while another byte is deemed ‘‘harmful’’. Simi-
larly,  if  a  device  meets  a  published  technical  specification  of  acceptable  ‘‘behavior’’ 
(or, for that matter, if it is type approved by the FCC), there is no reason to require 
special permission from the carrier before it can connect to the network. 
IV. Obstacles to Innovation in Wireless 

Wireless  entrepreneurship  is  not  for  the  faint  of  heart.  The  wireless  industry  is 
dominated  by  four  large  nationwide  carriers:  Verizon,  AT&T,  Sprint,  and  T-Mobile, 
a.k.a.,  ‘‘The  Big  4.’’  Members  of  our  Coalition  have  dealt  extensively  with  the  Big 
4,  as  partners,  suppliers,  customers,  and  competitors.  We  have  developed  business 
relationships at all levels of management and some of these relationships have even 
grown into friendships. The Big 4 counts among its ranks many bright and talented 
people,  including  more  than  a  few  visionaries  and  technical  wizards.  Dealing  with 
these  people  is  often  a  pleasure;  dealing  with  their  organizations  is  more  difficult. 
The Big 4 are large, generally risk-averse companies which exercise very tight con-
trol over their networks. 

An  entrepreneur  looking  to  create  a  new  device  or  service  that  somehow  touches 
one  of  these  networks  typically  has  to  get  some  measure  of  approval  from  the  car-
rier. For a new device this might involve waiting 6 months or longer while it under-
goes  ‘‘device  certification,’’  even  when  the  device  is  merely  a  cosmetically-altered 
variant of some previously tested device. For a new software application this might 
involve lengthy negotiations over ‘‘deck placement’’ of the software, which may com-
pete  with  an  inferior  product  offered  directly  by  the  carrier  itself.  For  an  MVNO, 
the approval often requires convincing the carrier’s wholesale arm that a new retail 
service  targets  an  under-served  market  niche  and  will  not  compete  for  customers

with the carrier’s retail arm. And as discussed above, the carriers’ Terms of Service 
also  prohibit  many  cutting  edge  applications  that  involve  passing  data  traffic  ‘‘over 
the top’’ of carrier networks. Each of these barriers significantly raises the cost and 
risk of bringing a mobile product or service to market. 

My  own  experience  starting  Virgin  Mobile  USA  is  instructive.  Virgin  Mobile  is  a 
success story, but one whose fate was by no means assured. While any new venture 
must  confront  the  slings  and  arrows  of  outrageous  fortune,  we  faced  the  additional 
risk of having to find a Big 4 carrier that would support, if not endorse, our business 
plan. We started in late 1999 with the idea for a product that addressed youth and 
other  segments  of  the  market  that  the  incumbents  saw  as  ‘‘unattractive’’  because 
they  were  too  poor,  too  low  credit,  and  too  hard  to  serve  with  existing  models.  We 
spent nearly 2 years traveling around to all the carriers to see if anyone would deal 
with  us.  In  general,  the  answer  was  ‘‘no’’  and  for  a  long  time  we  were  uncertain 
whether  anyone  would  let  us  get  off  the  ground.  By  far  the  scarcest  commodity  in 
this  process  was  network  access—it  was  far  easier  to  raise  capital  (Virgin  invested 
millions)—and  once  the  network  deal  was  complete  we  had  offers  for  additional  in-
vestment from outside investors for hundreds of millions more. In the end, only one 
of the weakest large players was willing to deal with us: Verizon and Cingular were 
dominant,  T-Mobile  had  a  powerful  corporate  parent,  but  Sprint  was  a  lagging  #3 
player. 

We  had  to  compromise  away  many  degrees  of  freedom  to  get  a  deal  done  with 
the network partner, Sprint. We agreed to market a prepaid product that would not 
directly  compete  with  Sprint’s  products  nor  compete  for  Sprint’s  mainstream  cus-
tomers. At the time we launched, 95 percent of the market was postpaid. Sprint was 
100  percent  postpaid.  Virgin  markets  only  to  youth,  only  offers  prepaid,  only  runs 
on the Sprint network, and Sprint has significant representation on the board of di-
rectors. We were only able to create the Virgin service by operating within the direct 
self-interest of a weaker player that needed help, by avoiding any direct competition 
with what they do, and by giving them a measure of control in our company. In gen-
eral,  this  frame  of  ‘‘complementarity’’  applies  to  almost  every  wholesale-style  rela-
tionship that the major carriers have done. Moreover, the additional frame of ‘‘cred-
ible  partners’’  with  track  record  and  capital  also  widely  applies.  Few  pure  upstarts 
gain  the  privilege  of  access  to  carrier  networks.  Of  course,  this  limits  the  potential 
for innovation by new firms with new ideas. After Virgin Mobile paved the way, the 
large  carriers  have  done  additional  MVNO  deals,  but  who  knows  what  great  new 
idea is sitting in wireless purgatory, waiting for approval from the Big 4. 

A  wholesale  deal  with  Sprint  was  only  the  beginning  of  our  treacherous  journey 
for  Virgin  Mobile.  We  had  to  navigate  many  arcane  business  processes  in  order  to 
get our phones into the market. One of the best examples is the device certification 
process  mentioned  above.  Device  certification  is  a  big  deal.  It  is  always  the  subject 
of  major,  detailed  negotiation  in  the  MVNO  relationships  I  have  been  a  part  of  (I 
have negotiated Virgin’s, several as a McKinsey consultant, and one for each of my 
subsequent  ventures  Blue  and  Txtbl).  Almost  all  MVNOs  end  up  taking  ‘‘table 
scraps’’  from  the  big  carrier,  i.e.,  they  use  devices  that  have  already  been  approved 
by  the  big  carrier  but  which  the  carrier  has  cast  aside.  We  followed  this  pattern  at 
Virgin Mobile, simply releasing devices that Sprint had already certified months be-
fore and wasn’t currently marketing. We did this because certification is so tedious. 
It is estimated to take 6–9 months for a new phone. These days, the state of phone 
technology  is  such  that  a  new  phone  can  be  designed  in  less  than  3  months.  Yet 
the carriers take three times as much time to certify. Most non-U.S. networks take 
much  less  time—any  device  maker  will  tell  you—which  is  why  many  cutting  edge 
devices are introduced in Europe or Asia before the U.S. For one of my other compa-
nies,  a  different  large  carrier  made  us  go  through  a  45-day  process  to  get  approval 
for changing the wallpaper and ringtones . . . on a phone that had already been cer-
tified. 

The  certification  process  is  also  inequitable.  One’s  position  in  the  certification 
queue is influenced by the carrier’s marketing staff. MVNO devices get pushed down 
the  queue  for  later  approval.  Exceptions  are  not  usually  made  for  wholesale  part-
ners but I have often heard of partially-certified, not-properly-working devices being 
released by the retail carrier for ‘‘marketing impact’’. 

Of  course,  it  is  possible  to  navigate  through  these  obstacles.  We  have  done  it  be-
fore.  Our  experience  tells  us,  however,  that  the  path  can  be  arduous,  especially 
when  compared  to  our  experiences  in  other  sectors  of  the  telecom  industry,  espe-
cially  the  Internet.  Experience  also  tells  us  that  these  efforts  often  do  not  succeed 
or  do  so  slowly  or  at  substantial  costs.  For  every  Virgin  Mobile  there  are  several 
other ventures that were not able to navigate the carrier maze.

V. Requirements for Innovation in Wireless 

85 

Wireless  entrepreneurship  would  take  a  huge  step  forward  if  wireless  was  more 
like  the  Internet.  What  makes  the  wireline  Internet  so  friendly  from  an  entre-
preneur’s  perspective  is  its  Openness.  One  does  not  have  to  ask  Comcast  or  Time 
Warner  Cable  or  even  Verizon’s  DSL  division  for  permission  to  launch  a  new  prod-
uct,  service,  or  device.  To  borrow  the  Nike  slogan,  you  can  ‘‘just  do  it.’’  In  wireless, 
on  the  other  hand,  you  can  ‘‘just  ask  the  Big  4.’’  If  you  are  skillful—or  lucky— 
enough to make it through to the other side, the upside can be large. Yet entrepre-
neurship  is  an  iterative,  trial-and-error  process.  Having  to  engage  with  the  Big  4 
at  each  cycle  in  the  process  can  slow  time  to  market  and  increase  risks  and  costs 
for  the  entrepreneur.  One  should  not  have  to  negotiate  with  an  access  provider  to 
offer  a  product  elsewhere  in  the  value  chain.  Based  on  my  experiences  and  those 
of my fellow Coalition members, I would like to offer a few observations about what 
it takes to innovate in wireless. 

First,  innovation  requires  small  bets  with  real  customer  feedback  and  iterations. 
This  is  the  ‘‘try,  try  again’’  rule.  Entrepreneurs  need  ‘‘laboratory’’  settings  to  com-
mercialize  ideas  that  may  initially  look  small  but  turn  out  to  be  quite  big.  This 
means  access  to  real,  live  customers  using  real,  live  networks.  The  bar  was  very 
high for us when we launched Virgin Mobile in the U.S.—we spent $40 million sim-
ply  to  put  together  the  basic  systems  to  run  the  service  and  meet  Sprint’s  integra-
tion  requirements.  This  was  quite  a  high  bar  to  trial  our  ideas.  By  contrast,  most 
Internet  services  can  be  developed,  trialed,  refined,  and  redeployed  multiple  times 
in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost. This is one reason the Internet 
is such a great breeding ground for innovation. 

Second,  freedom  to  enter  the  market  is  essential.  It  is  very  difficult  to  know,  a 
priori,  where  the  good  new  ideas  will  come  from  or  the  magnitude  of  their  impact 
on the market. For example, IBM gave up the rights to the Microsoft operating sys-
tem.  Yahoo!  declined  to  acquire  Google’s  search  engine.  And  of  course  AT&T  be-
lieved the cell phone would never become a ‘‘mass market’’ product. Innovation often 
happens from the edge of a market. Some of the most important inventions in tele-
communications,  including  the  Hayes  Smartmodem,  online  services,  the  answering 
machine,  and  speakerphones  were  all  commercialized  by  outsiders  to  the  Bell  Sys-
tem.  Yet  these  new  products  and  services  were  only  made  possible  by  the  FCC’s 
Carterfone decision and Part 68 rules, which removed the Bell companies from their 
traditional role as gatekeeper of the network. 

Third,  the  most  disruptive  innovations  are  typically  the  ones  most  easily  dis-
missed by market incumbents. Some innovation is merely incremental and accretive 
to the existing business franchises of the incumbents. But the big changes are often 
disruptive  (or  appear  so  initially)  and  threaten  them.  When  we  started  Virgin,  the 
only  carrier  who  was  willing  to  deal  with  us  was  also  the  only  big  carrier  with  no 
prepaid  mobile  phone  service  and  the  distant  number  three  player  with  little  hope 
of catching the top spot. More fundamentally, it is easy to see why a market leader 
such  as  Verizon  Wireless  so  fiercely  opposes  opening  up  its  networks.  They  have  a 
closed  business  model  that  makes  a  lot  of  money  and  they  fear  that  a  loss  of  net-
work control will mean a loss of their position. 

The  upshot  is  that  America  is  not  innovating  in  wireless  at  nearly  the  rate  it 
could be. While all the ingredients for innovation—wireless broadband networks, IP 
networking  stacks,  advanced  multimedia  devices—are  readily  available,  the  incum-
bent operators are too hesitant to try a new recipe for change. We think the indus-
try needs a good test kitchen. 
VI. The Open Access Solution 

Our  Coalition  believes  that  an  Open  Access  requirement  on  the  E  Block  provides 
a  concrete  and  actionable  way  to  carve  out  a  portion  of  the  wireless  market  for  en-
trepreneurial  activity.  Specifically,  we  believe  the  FCC  can  unlock  a  wave  of  entre-
preneurial energy if it implements three forms of Open Access in the E Block: Open 
Services, Open Devices, and Open Auction. 
Open Services 

An Open Services rule would require that the E Block service provider allow cus-
tomers to access ‘‘over the top’’ Internet-style applications of all kinds. These would 
include many kinds of services currently prohibited under the Big 4 subscriber con-
tracts. Verizon Wireless, for example, prohibits the use of VoIP, webcams, and other 
media services. Under the Open Access rule, these kinds of Terms of Service would 
not  be  allowed.  Entrepreneurs  would  be  free  to  create  a  low-cost  voice  offering  or, 
say, a mobile social network with videoblogging capabilities. The only limits on new 
service  ideas  would  be  the  entrepreneur’s  imagination,  not  the  wireless  operator’s 
Terms of Service.

86 

Open Devices 

The  Open  Devices  rule  would  ensure  that  users  can  connect  any  device  of  their 
choosing to their wireless network, provided it meets certain publicly specified tech-
nical  standards.  The  consumer  device  industry  has  undergone  a  revolution  in  the 
past  few  years.  Modular  design  and  contract  manufacturing  now  make  it  possible 
for  even  an  upstart  to  sell  sophisticated,  purpose-built  devices.  In  particular,  RF 
technology  is  becoming  increasingly  commoditized,  which  means  that  it  is  now  pos-
sible to embed wireless capabilities into devices using off-the-shelf component parts. 
We  envision  a  wave  of  opportunity  in  the  device  space,  including  the  evolution  of 
cell phones toward ‘‘broadband communicators’’, the addition of wireless community 
features  to  portable  media  and  gaming  devices,  and  even  using  wireless  to  provide 
cheap  connectivity  to  otherwise  ‘‘dumb’’  appliances.  We  are  starting  to  see  these 
kinds  of  devices  emerge  with  local  area  WiFi  capabilities,  but  the  possibilities  are 
even greater once the devices can access the sort of wide area 4G networks that will 
operate  in  the  700  MHz  band.  Bringing  a  new  product  to  market  is  always  a  risky 
proposition,  but  it  is  made  more  risky  by  the  need  to  pass  a  carrier’s  certification 
process, which as noted above is filled with uncertainty, is non-transparent, and can 
take many months. Under the proposed Open Devices rule, entrepreneurs would be 
free  to  bring  new  devices  to  market,  gauge  customer  reaction,  and  evolve  the  prod-
uct  all  in  the  time  that  it  otherwise  would  have  spent  languishing  in  a  Big  4  lab 
somewhere.  Especially  when  the  underlying  RF  components  have  been  shown  to 
meet  a  ‘‘do  no  harm’’  technical  standard,  there  is  no  reason  to  subject  the  entre-
preneur—or her customers—to needless bottlenecks. 
Open Auction 

Finally,  we  applaud  the  recent  suggestion  made  by  Google  and  Frontline  that  a 
portion of the E Block network capacity be made available to all comers via an auc-
tion.  This  will  ensure  a  range  of  new  MVNO  opportunities  at  fair  and  transparent 
market-clearing  prices.  Moreover,  we  can  envision  the  connectivity  being  used  in 
some  non-traditional  ways.  For  instance,  someone  could  offer  an  inexpensive  wire-
less service subsidized by location-based advertising. Or, in another example, an en-
trepreneur  starting  an  ‘‘over-the-air’’  online  music  store  could  include  the  cost  of 
wireless  connectivity  in  the  price  of  the  song  download,  so  that  the  customer  never 
has to subscribe to a wireless service to gain access to the music store. And of course 
there  are  many  more  ideas  that  we  haven’t  even  thought  of  yet  (if  the  proposal  is 
adopted). 
VII. Pragmatic Considerations: the E Block as Starting Point 

Perhaps  the  best  aspect  of  the  E  Block  proposal,  in  our  view,  is  that  while  it  is 
forward thinking, it is also realistic. We believe it would be an eminently reasonable 
approach  to  apply  Open  Access  only  to  the  E  Block.  We  observe  that  10  MHz  is  a 
relatively  small  portion  of  the  commercial  700  MHz  spectrum  and  only  about  2.7 
percent of more than 350 MHz that will have been allocated for CMRS use following 
this  auction  and  last  year’s  AWS  auction.1 Over  time,  the  provision  of  Open  Access 
services  by  at  least  one  carrier  in  the  market  could  apply  competitive  pressure  to 
the others to open up as well. A slight regulatory nudge could result in a major push 
by market forces. 

Finally, we want to point out that the Open Access proposal also raises the possi-
bility that entrepreneurs like us can bring new ideas and energy to the public safety 
market.  Open  Access  would  create  new  opportunities  for  specialized  public  safety 
devices and services, just as it would for commercial uses. Indeed, we note that the 
openness  of  the  Internet  has  spawned  many  important  and  vital  technologies  such 
as firewalls, VPNs, routers, and other products geared toward network security. An 
Open  Access  regime,  by  unbundling  network  functionalities,  allows  for  the  develop-
ment  of  ‘‘best  of  breed’’  security  tools  that  bring  state-of-the-art  thinking  to  each 
layer  of  the  network  stack.  Openness  increases  competition  to  meet  public  safety’s 
unique  requirements,  by  enabling  customers  to  assemble  an  end-to-end  framework 
using the best available component piece parts. 

As  entrepreneurs,  we  subscribe  to  the  old  maxim,  ‘‘nothing  ventured,  nothing 
gained.’’  In  our  opinion,  an  Open  Access  E  Block  is  a  venture  worth  pursuing,  be-
cause the gains are potentially enormous. 

1 After  the  700  MHz  auction  there  will  be  approximately  358  MHz  allocated  for  CMRS.  This 
includes 50 MHz for cellular licenses, 120 MHz for Broadband PCS, 14 MHz for ESMR, 90 MHz 
for AWS, and 84 MHz at 700 MHz. This does not include nearly 200 MHz of EBS/BRS spectrum 
and over 50 MHz of MSS/ATC spectrum becoming available for CMRS-like services.

APPENDIX B: ATTRIBUTES OF CLOSED VS. OPEN NETWORKS 

Devices 

Services 

Access 

‘‘Closed’’ 
• Carrier certification required before 
new device allowed to operate on the 
network 
• Carrier limits content and applica-
tions that may be accessed over the 
network 
• Carrier hides protocols needed to ac-
cess network features (e.g., geo-
graphical positioning data) 
• Carriers very selective about which 
companies may buy wholesale network 
access, look for ‘‘complementary’’ (i.e., 
non-threatening) business models 

‘‘Open’’ 
• New devices do not have to be ap-
proved by carrier as long as they meet 
published technical specification 
• Users may access any content or 
service just as they can with the Inter-
net 
• Public APIs allow independent devel-
opers to create services using network 
‘‘hooks’’ 
• Any service provider may purchase 
network capacity via an open auction 
that prevents favoritism and ensures 
price transparency

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. 
If one of the goals of this auction is to encourage better participa-
tion,  would  the  establishment  of  a  smaller  block  size  help?  May  I 
ask the panel? 

Mr. Small? 
Mr. SMALL. Clearly, smaller block sizes are determinative to our 
ability  to  participate  in  the  auction.  We  can  bid  on  virtually  all 
CMAs,  occasionally  an  EA,  and  the  REAGs  are  totally  out  of  the 
question.  And  we  believe—we  make  our  money  by  serving  rural 
and  small  cities,  and  we  think  licenses  should  get  in  the  hands  of 
the people who want to do that, not be put in the hands of national 
players  only,  who  then  have  to  be  induced,  or  forced,  to  kind  of 
serve the rural areas. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Lynch? 
Mr. LYNCH. Senator, the band plan that I mentioned in my open-
ing  remarks—band  plan  3—provides  for  licenses  of  all  sizes,  from 
the very smallest licenses that Mr. Small’s talking about, to the re-
gional areas, which I’m a significant proponent of. 

I  think  that  you  have  to  balance,  in  assigning  license  sizes,  two 
different drivers here. Number one, to entice the smaller companies 
to  participate  in  the  auction,  I  think  you  need  the  smaller  license 
sizes.  That’s  a  given.  I  would  agree  with  Mr.  Small  on  that.  But 
when  you  look  at  our  business  plan,  at  Verizon  Wireless,  my  goal 
is  to  deliver  a  4G  experience  across  the  country.  And  historically, 
because of many of the smaller licenses that we have had to aggre-
gate  over  time,  it  takes  many  years.  In  fact,  we’re  going  to  close, 
in  July,  on  a  couple  of  licenses  that  have  been  out  there  for  years 
and years, that we’ve been trying to fill in a piece of the upper west 
part of the country. 

So, to us, a REAG, or the larger license, provides us a more expe-
ditious opportunity to deploy 4G services than would an attempt to 
aggregate  in  the  secondary  market,  which  is,  in  fact,  what  we 
would end up having to do, over years. 
So, I believe there’s a need for both. 
The CHAIRMAN. Dr. Sarva? 
Dr.  SARVA.  I  don’t  have  a  strong  view  about  the  large  or  the 
small  size  of  the  auction,  about  the  blocks,  but  I  do  have  a  view 
about the value of openness in that context. 

If  there’s  a  band  of  the  spectrum  which  is  open  for  many  dif-
ferent  types  of  providers,  innovators,  and  entrepreneurs,  but  also 
smaller  carriers  to  use,  it  provides  them  an  immediate  access  to  a 
national coverage area using that open band. 

I  believe  the  open-access  band  actually  increases  the  value  of 
every individual block whether it’s large or small, because it makes 
the  winner  of  a  block  able  to  offer  a  service  that  runs  nationally. 
And that’s a very important aspect of the open-access proposal. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Because  of  the  complexity  before  us,  I’ll  be  sub-
mitting  my  questions  to  you,  and  I  hope  you  can  respond  to  them. 

Senator Stevens? 
Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  I,  also,  will  submit  some  specific  ques-

tions. 

But let me ask one. 
There are some who argue that we should have a buildout based 
on  population,  others  argue  we  should  have  a  geographic-based 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 02, 2012 Jkt 074104 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74104.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

89 

buildout.  And  I  have  the  opinion  that  one  size  doesn’t  fit  all.  Is 
there any way we could develop a sliding scale to ensure that rural 
America  is  not  left  out,  but,  at  the  same  time,  that  the  demands 
of the major markets, such as New York, would be met? 

What do you think? Anyone have an opinion? 
Mr. Lynch? 
Mr. LYNCH. Yes, Senator. I believe that that can best be achieved 
in  the  following  way.  And  what  I  mean  by  that  is  that  I  believe  a 
POP-based  regime  is  the  correct  one  to  use  on  the  overall  basis. 
However,  what’s  important,  beyond  that,  is  the  amount  of  years 
that  the  carrier  who  wins  that  license  has  to  build-out  the  foot-
print.  And  to  entice  build-out  over  a  fairly  rapid  period  of  time 
without  making  it  inordinately—let’s  say,  financially  impossible, 
maybe a better term—I think you need to think in terms of 5 years 
to a reasonable percentage of the POPs to be built. That would cer-
tainly,  based  upon  how  you  achieve  that  percentage,  would  drive 
the  carrier  who  won  that  spectrum  to  have  to  go  into  the  rural 
areas.  I  mean,  as  an  example,  Senator,  we,  today,  go  into  many 
areas that you would consider to be very rural. If we define ‘‘rural’’ 
as  under  100  POPs  per  square  mile,  much  of  the  territory  that 
Verizon  Wireless  already  covers  would  be  considered  rural.  But  I 
will  also  be  the  first  to  admit  to  you  that  there  are  parts  of  the 
country  where  we’re  down  to  one  and  two  people  per  square  mile 
that we have not, at this point in time, managed to reach yet. 

The  new  spectrum,  because  of  its  propagation  characteristics,  I 

believe, will allow us to get there much more quickly. 

Senator STEVENS. Thank you. 
Mr. Small, any comment? 
Mr.  SMALL.  I  would  add  to  that,  that  I  believe  geographic  build-
out  requirements  are  wrong,  in  general,  but  they’re  extremely  det-
rimental  to  rural  areas,  because  it’ll  become  uneconomic  to  cover 
25  percent,  even,  of  your  State  in  total  geography.  And  I  believe  a 
recent  letter  was  sent  by  55  rural  companies  to  the  FCC  stating 
exactly  that.  So,  it  will  have  the  perverse  action  of  making  it  un-
economic  to  even  accept  a  license—or  bid  for  a  license  in  a  rural 
area. 

Senator STEVENS. Thank you. 
Dr.  Sarva?  I  take  it  you  are  supporting,  Dr.  Sarva,  the  position 
that was presented by the last panel, on Frontline. Now, let me ask 
you,  in  addition  to  that  question,  of  geography  versus  population, 
don’t you believe that if we agree with you, that that would reduce 
the overall bid for all spectrum? 

Dr. SARVA. The element that we’re here to support, that I believe 
very  strongly  in,  is  the  open  access  element.  The  comment  I  made 
just  a  moment  ago,  Senator,  is  that  I  think  the  open  access  pro-
posal  increases  the  value  of  any  individual  block  of  spectrum,  be-
cause the winner in a State like Alaska or Hawaii is willing to bid 
more to own that particular block, because they know they have ac-
cess  to  a  national  coverage  area  around  the  rest  of  the  country. 
They  can  build  a  franchise  in  their  locality,  and  offer  their  cus-
tomers  national  reach  whenever  they  travel.  It’s  an  important  as-
pect  that’s  not  available  today.  It’s  a  very  expensive  roaming  re-
gime of interconnection fees that are paid. Those are difficult. And 
I think Mr. Small can comment on that.

So, I believe open access enhances the value of the spectrum, for 

that reason, number one. Number two, I think—— 

Senator STEVENS. Well, that’s not quite the answer—— 
Dr. SARVA.—innovation leads to—— 
Senator STEVENS.—to the question. 
Dr. SARVA. I’m sorry. 
Senator STEVENS. Will it decrease the total receipt of the Federal 

Government for the spectrum? 

Dr.  SARVA.  Sir,  my  hunch  is  that  you’d  get  more  money  as  a  re-
sult,  because  in  localities,  folks  are  willing  to  pay  more  for  their 
particular piece of that spectrum instead of just having one or two 
bidders who can play at the national scale. 

Mr.  LYNCH.  Senator,  if  I  might,  I  respectfully  disagree  with  Dr. 
Sarva,  and  I  agree  with  you.  The  geographic  requirement  will,  in 
fact, dictate a lower auction bid, because there would be a more im-
mediate  and  more  apparent  obligation  to  make  more  investment 
into  that  property  early  on.  So,  the  total  net  value  that  we  would 
be  willing  to  pay  isn’t  going  to  change.  But  what  will  happen  is 
that  we  would  put  less  into  the  auction  because  we  knew  we  were 
going to have to put more into the buildout. 

Senator STEVENS. That was my opinion. 
Thank you very much. 
Dr.  SARVA.  Oh,  I’m  sorry.  I’m  sorry,  Senator,  I  didn’t  actually 
mean  to  suggest  that  I  disagreed  with  Mr.  Lynch  there.  I  think 
population’s very important, and building the biggest national mar-
ket  as  quickly  as  possible  creates  the  most  opportunities  to  take 
services to market. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Thune? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

Senator THUNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
For  a  state  like  South  Dakota,  having  access  to  needed  tech-
nology is a critical issue. And I guess the question I have is that— 
many of you have stated your opposition to buildout requirements. 
And  the  question  is,  if  the  FCC  does  not  include  buildout  require-
ments  in  its  rulemaking,  what  incentive  is  there  to  serve  rural 
areas? 

Mr.  LYNCH.  Senator,  if  I  might,  first  of  all,  I  don’t  think  that 
Verizon  Wireless  is  positing  a  position  that  we  disagree  with  all 
buildouts. We are willing to step up to the obligatory buildout that 
goes  with  the  license.  The  point  that  we  were  making  before  to 
Senator Stevens’ question, of course, was, the amount we would bid 
on  that  license  would  be  very  different  depending  upon  what  the 
buildout requirements were. 

But  I  happen  to  believe  that,  particularly  in  your  State,  I’m  fa-
miliar  with  the  buildout  that  we’ve  been  doing  in  your  State  over 
time,  and  we’ve  still  got  more  to  go—but  that  has  as  much  to  do 
with the spectrum that we’ve used to deploy that as anything else. 
But,  as  we  continue  to  deploy—and  I’ve  spent  about  $6  billion  a 
year expanding the network—every year, we move further and fur-
ther into the very rural part of the country. And I believe that 700 
MHz—regardless of the buildout requirements, the business oppor-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 02, 2012 Jkt 074104 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74104.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

91 

tunities  will  drive  us  to  utilize  the  better  propagation  characteris-
tics  of  that  spectrum  to  move  further  out  into  the  rural  markets 
than we can do with any of the spectrum we have today. 

Mr.  SMALL.  And,  Senator,  I  feel  strongly  that  allowing  regional 
players  to  have  spectrum  in  bite-sized  chunks  that  we  can  deal 
with is what drives investment in rural America. For us to compete 
against  the  larger  national  players,  we  have  to  differentiate  our-
selves,  and  that’s  by  taking  better  care  of  our  local  communities 
and  in  building  more  cell  sites,  opening  stores  with  our  associates 
in communities that wouldn’t otherwise be there, and even seeking 
universal  service  funds  to  do  that.  For  example,  we  just  built, 
about  2  years  ago,  cell  sites  in  Shaw  and  Black  Hawk,  Louisiana, 
which  brought  telephone  service  to  those  communities  for  the  first 
time.  There  had  been  no  landline,  there  had  been  nothing,  despite 
all  the  perceived  universal  service  requirements  that  have  been  in 
this country for, you know, dozens of years. 

So, I think, incentivizing regional providers is the best way to ac-

complish your objective. 

Senator  THUNE.  If—and  you  all  seem  to  be  in  favor  of  offering 
both small and large licensing blocks, but I guess my question is— 
and  you,  sort  of,  gave  an  answer  to  that,  Mr.  Small—but  is  that 
regulation,  alone,  enough  to  ensure  that  smaller  telecom  providers 
are going to be able to competitively be engaged in the process? 

Mr.  SMALL.  I  think  having  the  two  CMA  blocks  gives  us  a  good 
opportunity.  And  you  need  to  balance  the  interests  of  all,  but  we 
would  be  pleased  with  that  outcome.  I  know  Centennial  will  be  in 
the auction, and, I do believe, other regional providers as well. Will 
that  answer  the  needs  of  every  community  everywhere?  No.  In 
many  cases,  large  national  carriers  will  buy  the  smaller  licenses. 
They’ve  done  that  in  past  auctions,  and  I  would  expect  that  would 
happen  in  the  future.  When  you  look  at  your  real  policy  choices, 
the  best  way  to  get  more  coverage  to  rural  areas  is,  first  and  fore-
most,  to  get  the  700  MHz  out  there,  because  of  its  better  propaga-
tion,  and,  second,  to  give  a  diversity  of  owners  to  that  spectrum. 
Mr.  Lynch  mentioned  100  POPs  per  square  mile.  They  go  down 
as far as that, and that’s our average. And we serve areas with two 
and three POPs per square mile. 

Senator  THUNE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  may  have  a  statement  to  in-
clude  in  the  record,  and  I  will  yield  back.  I  understand  we  have  a 
vote underway. So, I yield back. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.

U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS 

Senator  KERRY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I  know  we  do 

have a vote on, and I’ll try to go through this. 

First  of  all,  thank  you  for  doing  this  hearing.  This  is  a  critical 
hearing,  and  I  appreciate  your  leadership  on  it,  and  getting  the 
Committee involved, at this stage. 

I have a couple of questions, but I’d like to just make a few com-

ments, if I can, Mr. Chairman.

92 

First  of  all,  this  upcoming  auction  of  spectrum  in  the  700  MHz 
band  has  profound  implications  beyond  just  the  question  of  rev-
enue. And I know revenue is something some people are concerned 
on. And we had a discussion here in this Committee, I guess about 
the  level  we  could  anticipate  on  the  sale.  I  think  we  set  it  some-
where  in  the  twelve  and  a  half  billion  or  something,  with  many 
people  suggesting  more  may  come.  But  I  want  to  emphasize  that 
the  profound  implications  of  this—for  consumers,  for  schools,  for 
businesses,  small  businesses,  for  emergency  first  responders,  and 
for the rural communities we just heard about—can’t be underesti-
mated at all that this is a unique opportunity. 

The Chair and the Vice Chair have been here through a long de-
veloping  stage  of  America’s  communications  systems,  and  we’ve 
seen  a  lot  of  promises  made,  a  lot  of  promises  broken,  and  we’ve 
seen a huge transformation. When we sat here in 1996 and talked 
about  what  we  were  going  to  do  in  that  bill,  the  entire  discussion 
was  telephony,  and  not  many  people  thought  about  data.  And, 
within  a  matter  of  months,  it  was  obsolete,  and  we  didn’t  see  the 
promises fulfilled by the Baby Bells and others as to market entry. 
So, we have to, sort of, think about this with the history that we’ve 
traveled on in this Committee. 

And  with  this  auction,  we  stand  at  a  crossroads.  We  can  either 
provide  extraordinary  benefits  to  millions  of  Americans,  or  we  can 
tilt  bandwidth  policy  to  improve  the  already  significant  position  of 
a few powerful deliverers of this service. 

I  think  there’s  a  clear  path  that  we  have  to  take.  The  airwaves 
belong to the American people, and their use must always, even as 
we serve the marketplace that we are, it must also serve the public 
interest.  So,  the  rules  of  this  auction  are  critical.  We’ve  got  to  en-
courage  competitive  entry  into  the  wireless  market.  We  have  to 
spur innovation. We have to increase affordability. And we have to 
increase the availability of broadband services. 

The  fact  is—and  there’s  no  argument  about  this—we’re  lagging 
in deployment. More than 60 percent of Americans do not subscribe 
to  broadband  services,  primarily  because  they  don’t  have  access  or 
they can’t afford it. 

In  my  own  State  of  Massachusetts,  which  is  a  recognized  leader 
in innovation and technological advancement, we have a 49 percent 
broadband  penetration  rate.  And,  guess  what?  We’re  the  fourth 
best in the country. 

So,  this  auction  of  very  valuable  spectrum—some  people  have 
called  this  the  beachfront  property  of  communications—the  key  is, 
how do we serve this importance? How do we ensure that it works 
for the American people? 

And,  I  think,  first  the  Commission  must  promote  the  broadest 
level  of  participation  in  the  auction,  as  a  guiding  rule;  encourage 
competition;  and  enable  entrepreneurs  to  think  innovatively  and 
provide affordable highspeed wireless broadband services. 

Auction  rules  must  be  directed  at  promoting  additional  market 
entrants,  not  just  serving  those  most  powerful,  capable  of  winning 
the  auction  bid  based  on  their  purchasing  power  today.  Open  ac-
cess  proposals  and  innovative  bidding  rules  have  got  to  be  closely 
considered.

And,  second,  I  believe  the  FCC  must  settle  on  a  strict  buildout 
requirement  that  compels  auction  winners  to  offer  services.  I  un-
derstand  the  fears  of  the  industry  about  this.  Some  say  that  if 
you’re  forced  to  build  a  network,  it  can  delay  service  and  innova-
tion. I’m absolutely confident that the Commission can find the ap-
propriate balance. The spectrum has to be deployed in a reasonable 
time,  but  also  in  a  reasonable  manner.  And  what  would  be  unac-
ceptable  is  a  set  of  rules  that  allow  large  companies  to  scoop  up 
and warehouse this spectrum. 

I’ve been very, very encouraged, Mr. Chairman, by your attention 
on  this  matter.  And  I’m  confident  that  you,  also,  want  to  seek 
strong requirements. 

I’m  also  encouraged  that  the  Commission  is  taking  a  close  look 
at  solutions  for  public  safety.  And  I  see  our  friends,  first  respond-
ers,  here  in  the  room.  We’ve  been  working  on  interoperability  for 
quite some time, Mr. Chairman; and, despite our efforts, interoper-
ability  remains  one  of  our  most  vexing  policy  challenges,  despite 
the lessons of 9/11 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 

So,  providing  an  effective  public  safety  communications  network 
is  of  paramount  importance,  and  I’m  encouraged  that  the  industry 
leaders are thinking about this, also, in an innovative way. 

Every  American  has  an  opportunity  to  benefit  from  this  auction. 
And  I,  once  again,  emphasize,  the  long-term  revenue  stream  that 
will come by adequately fostering the market growth that can come 
with this, and the market penetration that can come with this, far 
exceeds that, sort of, up-front quick hit that you look at in the auc-
tion  itself,  and  we  need  to  keep  that  in  mind.  When  you  look  at 
the  60  percent  of  penetration,  if  we  can  get  that,  and  get  small 
businesses  and  parts  of  our  rural  States  that  suddenly  become 
places where business can move and get into this fourth-generation 
world, we’re going to be a much stronger economy, with a stronger 
tax  base,  with  a  stronger  job  base,  and  more  competitive  than  the 
global  community.  And  I  think  we  need  to  look  to  that  long-term 
strength. 

So, for schools, for our economy, for our families, for our first re-
sponders,  this  is  a  pretty  critical  process,  and  I  appreciate  the  at-
tention of the Committee to it. 

The  big  question—I  have  just  one  or  two  questions,  if  we  have 
time,  quickly—Mr.  Lynch,  is,  if  Verizon  and  other  incumbent 
broadband service providers win most of the spectrum, is there any 
guarantee,  then,  that  a  third-pipe  provider  is  going  to  be  able  to 
enter the market; a guarantee? 

Mr.  LYNCH.  Senator,  I’m  not  sure  exactly  how  to  answer  your 
question  with  a  very  few  words,  but  let  me  say  this.  With  900  li-
censes at auction in the band plan that we’ve been recommending, 
which  is  band  plan  3,  I  think  that  there  is  a  tremendous  oppor-
tunity for new entrants, as well as existing providers, who, like us, 
have a commitment to putting fourth-generation out there. 

Again,  I’m  saying  I’m  not  sure  exactly  how  to  answer  the  ques-

tion that you’ve asked. 

Senator KERRY. Well, maybe rather than be rushed like this, be-
cause I know we’ve got a vote, and I don’t want to tie us up, maybe 
I could pursue this, Mr. Chairman, in a couple of written questions, 
and  just  follow  up  in  a  way  that  would  develop  the  record  on  it,

which  I’d  like  to  do,  and  that  would  serve  all  of  us,  perhaps,  more 
effectively. 

Mr. LYNCH. Thank you. We’ll do that. 
Senator KERRY. I really thank the Chair. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Kerry follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  upcoming  auction  of  spectrum  in  the  700  band  has  profound 
implications  for  consumers,  schools,  businesses,  emergency  first  responders,  and 
rural communities. We are presented with a unique opportunity to shape the future 
of wireless communication and innovation in America. 

With this auction, we stand at a crossroads—we can either provide extraordinary 
benefits  to  millions  of  Americans  or  tilt  bandwidth  policy  to  line  the  pockets  of  a 
privileged few. 

There  is  a  clear  path  I  believe  must  be  taken:  the  airwaves  belong  to  the  Amer-

ican people, and their use should serve the public interest. 

We must establish rules in this auction that encourage competitive entry into the 
wireless  market,  spur  innovation  and  increase  affordability  and  availability  of 
broadband services. 

There  is  no  argument  that  we  are  lagging  in  deployment.  More  than  60  percent 
of  Americans  do  not  subscribe  to  broadband  service—primarily  because  they  don’t 
have access or can’t afford it. 

My  own  state  of  Massachusetts,  a  recognized  leader  in  innovation  and  techno-
logical  advancement,  has  a  49  percent  broadband  penetration  rate.  And  it  is  4th 
best in the country. 

So  this  auction  of  very  valuable  spectrum,  takes  on  heightened  importance.  How 

do we ensure it works for the American people? 

First, the Commission must promote the broadest level of participation in the auc-
tion, to encourage competition—and enable entrepreneurs to think innovatively, and 
provide  affordable,  high-speed  wireless  broadband  services.  Auction  rules  should  be 
directed  at  promoting  additional  market  entrants.  Open  access  proposals  and  inno-
vative bidding rules must be closely considered. 

Secondly,  the  FCC  must  settle  on  strict  build  out  requirements  that  compel  auc-
tion winners to offer services. Now, I understand the fears of industry in this area. 
If we are forced to build networks, it delays service and innovation. 

I  am  confident  the  Commission  can  find  the  appropriate  balance—The  spectrum 
must be deployed in a reasonable time. What would be unacceptable is a set of rules 
that  allow  large  companies  to  scoop  up  and  warehouse  this  spectrum.  I  have  been 
encouraged  by  the  Chairman’s  attention  to  this  matter,  and  I  will  be  looking  for  a 
strong set of requirements. 

Finally,  I  am  encouraged  that  the  Commission  is  taking  a  close  look  at  solutions 
for public safety. We have been working on the interoperability for quite some time. 
And  despite  our  efforts,  Mr.  Chairman,  interoperability  remains  one  of  our  most 
vexing policy challenges—despite the lessons of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. 

Providing  an  effective  public  safety  communications  network  is  of  paramount  im-
portance,  and  I  am  encouraged  that  industry  leaders  are  thinking  about  the  topic 
in an innovative way. 

All Americans have an opportunity to benefit from this auction. This is more than 
an  issue  of  Government  revenue—it  is  also  about  expanded  access  to  revolutionary 
new technology for every American. Our economy, our schools, our families and our 
first  responders  are  counting  on  the  FCC  to  conduct  a  fair  auction  in  the  spirit  of 
competition and innovation that drives our country. 

I, for one, will be watching closely. 

Mr. LYNCH. Thank you. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  With  that,  we  thank  the  panel,  and  we’ve  got  to 

go to vote. 

[Whereupon, at 12:15 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAM MONTANARI,  RADIO SYSTEMS MANAGER,  PINELLAS 
COUNTY,  FLORIDA;  CHAIRPERSON,  TAMPA BAY URBAN AREA INTEROPERABLE COM-
MUNICATIONS 
Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  my  name  is  Pam  Montanari  and 
I am Radio Systems Manager for Pinellas County, Florida. I also serve as the Chair-
person  for  Interoperable  Communications  for  the  Tampa  Bay  Urban  Area.  Thank 
you  for  this  opportunity  to  share  with  you  the  views  of  Pinellas  County  and  the 
Tampa  Bay  urban  area  on  the  pending  decision  by  the  Federal  Communications 
Commission  (FCC)  to  establish  rules  and  policy  for  the  auction  of  700  MHz  spec-
trum. This is an issue of great importance to public safety organizations throughout 
the  Nation  and  will  determine  our  ability  to  provide  life  saving  services  to  our  citi-
zens for many years to come. 

Pinellas  County,  Florida  is  among  the  largest  counties  in  the  United  States  and 
serves a permanent population of over 925,000 in west central Florida. We are dedi-
cated to providing state-of-the-art radio communications for over 9,500 public safety 
personnel.  The  Pinellas  County  Emergency  Communications  Department  is  com-
mitted to providing high quality, efficient service to the citizens of Pinellas County. 
Pinellas  County  embraces  new  technology  and  has  a  history  of  leading  field  tests 
for advanced high speed data and video communications. Starting in 2001, Pinellas 
County  conducted  the  first  test  of  wideband  technology,  using  an  experimental  li-
cense on wideband channels in the 700 MHz band and it performed well for the ex-
change  of  public  safety  data  and  video.  Currently,  Pinellas  County  is  also  con-
ducting  tests  of  various  broadband  technologies  in  the  4.9  GHz  public  safety 
broadband  spectrum.  Pinellas  County  is  actively  involved  with  neighboring  public 
safety  agencies  in  the  Tampa  Bay  urban  area  to  achieve  interoperability  in  both 
voice and data communications solutions. 

Pinellas  County  and  the  Tampa  Bay  urban  area  support  the  concept  of  a  nation-
wide  broadband  network  designed  to  meet  public  safety  communications  require-
ments,  however,  it  would  be  unfortunate  if  public  safety  is  unnecessarily  restricted 
to this one technology for future data services. We have filed comments at the FCC 
stating  that  public  safety  should  be  provided  the  flexibility  to  deploy  either  wide-
band or broadband data solutions in the 700 MHz band. 

If  a  nationwide  broadband  network-only  proposal  is  adopted  without  allowing  for 
wideband deployment in the 700 MHz band, there will not be sufficient public safety 
frequencies  available  in  the  Tampa  Bay  area  for  implementing  both  regional  voice 
and  high  speed  data  solutions.  Our  public  safety  agencies  must  have  the  flexibility 
to implement these advanced high speed data communications technologies, whether 
broadband  or  wideband.  We  support  using  the  700  MHz  data  spectrum  to  provide 
the  best  combination  of  public  and  private  high  speed  data  systems  that  meet  our 
coverage and operational requirements. 

Pinellas County strongly agrees with the many comments filed by all public safety 
representatives  that  overwhelmingly  urged  the  Commission  to  ensure  flexibility  of 
solution choices in this band. As we noted above, Pinellas County is evaluating sev-
eral  technology  solutions,  both  broadband  and  wideband,  and  we  must  continue  to 
have  the  ability  to  choose  the  technologies  that  best  fit  our  local  requirements.  To 
our  knowledge,  no  public  safety  organizations  filing  comments  at  the  FCC  objected 
to having the flexibility to choose between broadband or wideband solutions. 

Pinellas County notes that while a nationwide broadband network built and oper-
ated  by  a  commercial  provider  should  be  explored,  there  are  a  number  of  details 
that must be decided before public safety organizations can place the lives and prop-
erty  of  our  citizens  in  the  hands  of  a  commercial  communications  provider  with  no 
other allowed options. The FCC must guarantee certain minimum standards will be 
met by any commercial licensee who acquires through auction the adjacent commer-
cial  spectrum  and  commits  to  build  out  a  nationwide  broadband  network  targeted 
for both public safety and commercial use.

96 

The FCC must ensure that commercial communications providers and public safe-
ty leadership and agencies participate equally in defining the specifics of a proposed 
nationwide  broadband  network.  For  example,  we  propose  that  the  specifications  in-
clude the following minimum benchmarks: 

1. When fully built out, the nationwide network should cover at least 95 percent 
of the jurisdictional area of the public safety agencies on the broadband network. 
This  means  that  a  city  fire  department  must  have  city-wide  coverage,  a  county 
sheriff  must  have  county-wide  coverage,  and  a  state  police  department  must 
have  state-wide  coverage.  Each  agency  must  have  at  least  95  percent  coverage 
at  a  minimum  specified  data  rate  and  level  of  reliability.  Further,  in  order  to 
provide  mutual  aid  and  interoperability  with  neighboring  agencies,  these  cov-
erage  requirements  should  extend  into  the  jurisdictional  areas  of  our  neigh-
boring  agencies.  Previously,  the  Commission  recognized  the  need  for  coverage 
into  adjacent  jurisdictions  when  it  established  rules  for  the  800  MHz  public 
safety band regional planning. For a broadband network to be nationwide when 
fully built out, coverage requirements tied to population alone are not sufficient. 
2.  Incident  commanders  and  first  responders  must  have  immediate  access  to 
communications resources in times of emergency incidents and disasters. This in-
cludes adequate channel capacity and operational control over the system, both 
the commercial as well as the public safety channels. We cannot wait for a na-
tional licensee or associated commercial carrier(s) to be contacted for a decision. 
On-scene  command  and  control  is  responsible  for  orchestrating  resources  as 
needed  to  control  the  emergency.  These  resources  today  include  local  respond-
ers,  assisting  agencies,  equipment  and  mission  critical  voice  communications. 
Going forward, agencies and incident commanders will also need control of high 
speed data and video communications resources at the incident as well. 
3.  Reliability  and  security  of  the  high  speed  data  communications  must  be  as-
sured  by  the  commercial  provider.  Public  safety,  especially  law  enforcement, 
must  have  the  capability  to  encrypt  sensitive  communications,  including  imag-
ing and video transfers and to control who has access to this information. These 
requirements  are  of  special  concern  for  a  network  which  is  proposed  to  accom-
modate both public safety and commercial traffic. Today’s dedicated public safe-
ty networks are not open to the public to use, however, this may not be the case 
under  the  Commission’s  proposed  concept  for  a  nationwide  broadband  network 
in the 700 MHz spectrum. Also, reliability requirements would dictate that the 
network  must  be  built  to  provide  transmission  redundancy,  back-up  power  in 
case of electric outages, and site, as well as network, security. 
4. The nationwide broadband network must have provisions for high speed data 
applications  that  meet  local  and  regional  public  safety  needs.  For  nationwide 
broadband interoperability, public safety applications on the network must have 
some  degree  of  uniformity  across  all  public  safety  agencies.  At  the  same  time, 
applications  must  meet  the  different  requirements  of  functional  agencies  (law 
enforcement,  fire,  EMS),  as  well  as  the  differing  requirements  of  agencies  in 
varying demographics across the country. This includes interfaces with existing 
local networks and databases, some of which are not compatible today. 

Regardless  of  the  governance  structure  the  Commission  provides  for  the  nation-
wide broadband public safety network, local and regional public safety entities must 
have  input  into  the  development  of  the  requirements  for  such  a  network.  The  con-
cept of a nationwide broadband network funded by commercial licensees in adjacent 
spectrum  is  appealing.  However,  given  the  many  outstanding  unknowns,  there  is 
currently  no  certainty  that  this  proposed  network  would  meet  the  operational  and 
monthly cost requirements of Pinellas County and the Tampa Bay urban area agen-
cies.  In  addition,  the  proposed  build  out  schedule  for  the  broadband  network  is  8– 
10  years,  and  it  is  likely  that  there  could  be  geographic  areas  that  still  would  not 
be covered by this network. 

Under  the  Commission’s  tentative  conclusion,  public  safety  agencies  would  have 
no option to deploy their own system if the promise of the nationwide network were 
not realized or if it were delayed in their area. Pinellas County and the Tampa Bay 
urban  area  believe  that  we  must  be  able  to  implement  a  high  speed  data  solution 
while  we  are  waiting  for  the  nationwide  broadband  carrier  to  roll  out  the  network 
to cover our jurisdictional region. Further, we need the option to maintain that net-
work  at  least  until  there  is  certainty  that  the  nationwide  broadband  network  as 
built in our area meets our specific operational requirements. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Pinellas  County  commends  you  for  holding  this  hearing.  It  is  im-
portant that the Congress, which first promised 700 MHz spectrum to public safety 
a  decade  ago,  maintain  oversight  over  the  implementation  by  the  Commission.

Available spectrum in these most desirable bands draws the attention of many who 
would  like  to  gain  access  to  public  safety’s  resources.  The  promise  of  a  nationwide 
broadband  network  constructed  and  paid  for  by  a  commercial  licensee  is  appealing, 
but we must remember the adage that ‘‘there is no such thing as a free lunch.’’ 

Pinellas  County  and  the  Tampa  Bay  urban  area  request  the  Committee  to  urge 
the Commission to provide local and state agencies the flexibility on at least a por-
tion  of  the  public  safety  data  spectrum  to  implement  the  solution  that  best  meets 
our high speed data requirements and budget. The options must include the ability 
to  choose  a  local  or  regional  network,  whether  broadband  or  wideband,  especially 
while we await the nationwide roll out of a commercially-based broadband network. 
Public  safety  agencies  can  work  through  their  regional  planning  committees  to  en-
able implementation of these choices on a local and regional basis. 

Again,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  Pinellas  County  and  the 
Tampa  Bay  urban  area  thanks  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on  our  con-
cerns about the 700 MHz auction and its potential impact on public safety. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

WANDA S. MCCARLEY 

Question 1. All parties appear to agree on the need to build a broadband network 
for  public  safety.  However,  the  cost  of  building  such  a  network  and  the  length  of 
time  it  would  take  to  complete  varies  significantly,  depending  upon  the  approach 
that is taken. There are essentially 3 options. Option 1 is that public safety can try 
to build and operate this network itself at the local and regional level, as has tradi-
tionally been the case. Option 2 is similar to what was proposed in the FCC’s ninth 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, where a national public safety licensee would part-
ner with a commercial operator to build a shared public safety commercial network 
using the 12 megahertz of spectrum already allocated to public safety. Option 3 fol-
lows  the  Frontline  proposal,  where  a  national  public  safety  licensee  would  partner 
with  a  commercial  operator  to  build  a  shared  network  that  not  only  uses  12  mega-
hertz  of  existing  public  safety  spectrum  but  also  10  megahertz  of  commercial  spec-
trum  that  will  soon  be  put  out  for  auction.  Under  each  of  these  scenarios,  what  is 
your  best  estimate  as  to  how  much  it  will  cost  public  safety  to  build  and  operate 
a  next-generation,  broadband  network,  and  how  long  will  it  take  to  build  out  this 
network across the nation? 

Answer.  The  actual  cost  to  public  safety  would  depend  on  numerous  factors— 
many  of  which  are  out  of  our  current  control.  It’s  safe  to  say,  however,  that  con-
struction alone of a network such as this, that meets public safety’s needs will cost 
many  billions  of  dollars.  Some  estimates  place  the  amount  in  the  range  of  $22  bil-
lion. The cost is generally the same under each of Options, though the decentralized 
approach in Option 1 could be higher due to the lack of economies of scale. The pri-
mary difference is whether and how those costs are paid. 

Under Option 1, the costs would be localized for each separate broadband system, 
as is currently the case with state/local public safety systems. We believe the result 
of this approach for broadband is that wealthy areas, or those few areas with special 
access  to  Federal  funds  (e.g.,  National  Capital  Area),  will  ultimately  build  systems, 
but  much  of  the  Nation  will  be  left  unserved  as  the  cost  of  a  broadband  network 
will  be  well-beyond  the  means  of  most  local  agencies.  Under  Option  2,  there  would 
be a single licensee, and theoretically a commercial partner. However, with only 12 
MHz  available,  there  would  not  be  sufficient  capacity  to  address  both  public  safety 
requirements  and  sufficient  commercial  use  to  justify  commercial  investment  and 
partnership.  The  national  licensee  would  also  lack  tax  and  bonding  authority,  leav-
ing it without any means to construct the national network. Option 3, or some vari-
ation of it, is what we favor, and what the FCC appears to have adopted in its order 
adopted  on  July  31.  This  approach  provides  sufficient  spectrum  for  a  joint  system 
that meets public safety broadband requirements and a viable commercial network. 
We  believe  that  Option  3,  or  a  variation  thereof,  is  the  only  way  to  build  a 
broadband  network  ‘‘across  the  nation’’.  We  have  advocated  that  the  network  be 
built  to  cover  99.3  percent  of  the  Nation’s  population  within  10  years,  with  signifi-
cant interim benchmarks that we believe are addressed in the FCC’s July 31 order. 
Question 2. One of the elements of proposals to create a public safety-private sec-
tor  partnership  is  the  creation  of  national  public  safety  licensee  to  negotiate  a  net-
work services agreement with a private operator. In your view, how should this na-
tional public safety licensee ensure that the needs of local first responders are met? 
Answer. We believe that the national licensee must be representative of local first 
responders. Thus, nine national public safety organizations have formed a nonprofit 
corporation  that  intends  to  apply  for  the  FCC  license.  Each  of  the  organizations 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 02, 2012 Jkt 074104 PO 00000 Frm 00101 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74104.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

shall select board members to the entity, and there will also be advisory committees 
of additional organizations and regional representatives.

Question  2a.  What  benefits  would  result  from  the  creation  of  a  public  safety  li-

Answer.  A  national  public  safety  licensee  could  more  effectively  negotiate  a  na-
tional  network  sharing  agreement  with  a  commercial  partner.  It  could  also  coordi-
nate  standards  and  interoperability  procedures  to  ensure  seamless  interoperability 
across the Nation. 

censee? 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

WANDA S. MCCARLEY 

Question 1. Current 700 MHz proposals seem to contemplate 24 MHz of spectrum 
for  public  safety.  Is  that  enough  to  meet  future  needs—particularly  in  light  of  new 
broadband applications? 

Answer. It is not sufficient. Even when the 24 MHz was first allocated (per legis-
lation passed in 1997), we knew it would not be sufficient to address all future data 
requirements.  Half  of  the  24  MHz  is  dedicated  for  narrowband  voice  systems,  for 
which there is substantial demand and existing deployments in some areas. The re-
maining  half,  standing  alone,  would  not  address  all  public  safety  requirements  for 
broadband, especially in urban areas. It is also insufficient for a public-private part-
nership  approach  as  there  would  not  be  ‘‘excess’’  capacity  for  commercial  operation. 
Question  2.  Does  the  additional  10  megahertz  of  public-private  spectrum  in  the 

Frontline proposal help solve any shortage? 

Answer.  Absolutely.  It  provides  additional  capacity  when  needed  for  major  emer-
gencies, and it provides the capacity needed for a viable public-private partnership. 
We  note,  however,  that  there  are  some  aspects  of  what  Frontline  proposed  that  we 
do  not  support.  Based  on  what  we  believe  is  in  the  FCC’s  July  31  order,  the  FCC 
appears to have found the right balance. 

Question 3. As you are all aware, one of the biggest problems facing public safety 
is interoperability. All too often, we see jurisdictional and technological barriers that 
inhibit  public  safety  officials  in  one  area  from  speaking  to  officials  in  an  adjoining 
area. Of the solutions currently before the FCC, which solution does the most to fos-
ter interoperability? 

Answer.  We  support  approaches  that  promote  viable  public-private  partnerships 
to build a nationwide, interoperable broadband network. A national network can be 
built  with  a  single  standard  and  provide  the  widest  possible  coverage  to  ensure 
seamless service and interoperability for first responders. There will still need to be 
a need for many years to tie together existing public safety radio networks operating 
in various frequency bands. 

Question  4.  If  a  public-private  partnership—of  some  sort—is  formed  to  manage  a 
portion  of  the  spectrum,  how  should  disputes  between  public  safety  users  and  pri-
vate entities be resolved? 

Answer.  Clearly,  public  safety  must  be  the  primary  factor  in  resolving  disputes. 
We  do  not  believe  that  the  license  for  the  relevant  commercial  spectrum  should  be 
granted unless and until a network sharing agreement is reached with the national 
public safety licensee. There should not be mandatory third-party mediation, as the 
disputes  are  likely  to  involve  non-commercial,  public  policy  issues  regarding  public 
safety communications. Thus, if there is to be dispute resolution, it should be man-
aged by the FCC. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

JAMES L. BARKSDALE 

Question 1. All parties appear to agree on the need to build a broadband network 
for  public  safety.  However,  the  cost  of  building  such  a  network  and  the  length  of 
time  it  would  take  to  complete  varies  significantly,  depending  upon  the  approach 
that is taken. There are essentially 3 options. Option 1 is that public safety can try 
to build and operate this network itself at the local and regional level, as has tradi-
tionally been the case. Option 2 is similar to what was proposed in the FCC’s Ninth 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, where a national public safety licensee would part-
ner with a commercial operator to build a shared public safety commercial network 
using the 12 megahertz of spectrum already allocated to public safety. Option 3 fol-
lows  the  Frontline  proposal,  where  a  national  public  safety  licensee  would  partner 
with  a  commercial  operator  to  build  a  shared  network  that  not  only  uses  12  mega-
hertz  of  existing  public  safety  spectrum  but  also  10  megahertz  of  commercial  spec-

trum  that  will  soon  be  put  out  for  auction.  Under  each  of  these  scenarios,  what  is 
your  best  estimate  as  to  how  much  it  will  cost  public  safety  to  build  and  operate 
a  next-generation,  broadband  network,  and  how  long  will  it  take  to  build  out  this 
network across the Nation? 

Answer.  While  the  figures  that  follow  are  only  our  best  estimates,  the  one  thing 
that is certain is that Frontline’s proposal for a public-private partnership will guar-
antee  the  construction  of  a  nationwide,  interoperable  public  safety  network  at  no 
cost  to  public  safety  and  the  American  taxpayers.  Frontline  approximates  a  cost  of 
$10  billion  or  less  to  construct  a  shared  network  with  public  safety,  and  all  costs 
will  be  borne  by  the  commercial  licensee.  Further,  this  option  is  the  most  economi-
cal, approximately doubling the spectrum available for public safety during peak ca-
pacity  while  dramatically  reducing  the  need  for  cell  splitting.  This  translates  into 
a  need  for  at  least  40  percent  fewer  towers,  which  is  pure  savings  of  what  econo-
mists call ‘‘deadweight loss.’’ 

In  contrast,  under  ‘‘Option  1,’’  public  safety  and  the  taxpayers  will  bear  the  cost 
of  constructing  a  public  safety  network.  This  option  is  by  far  the  most  expensive, 
and will cost somewhere between $15–$20 billion (or possibly more) to construct, be-
cause  it  will  require  far  more  towers  than  the  shared  network  proposed  by  Front-
line.  Further,  public  safety  will  be  forced  to  fund  the  construction  itself,  which  it 
has  stated  time  and  time  again  will  not  be  possible.  Similarly,  ‘‘Option  2’’  will  also 
cost  at  least  $15  billion  to  construct.  While  ‘‘Option  2’’  does  alleviate  some  of  the 
concerns  about  where  public  safety  will  receive  funding  to  construct  a  network,  the 
lack  of  a  sufficient  amount  of  spectrum  for  a  shared  network  will  certainly  limit 
public safety’s ability to secure a commercial partner and that partner’s willingness 
to fund the build-out will be significantly reduced. Further, it will not provide public 
safety with additional spectrum in times of emergency. 

In terms of the time frames for construction of a nationwide, interoperable public 
safety network, a 10 year buildout requirement is very achievable under Frontline’s 
Plan. Under ‘‘Option 1’’ and ‘‘Option 2,’’ however, it is very difficult to estimate how 
long  construction  will  take.  Option  1  is  likely  to  take  decades  because  of  the  need 
to  use  taxpayer  funding,  likely  generated  at  the  state  and  local  level.  Moreover, 
under  Option  1  with  different  networks  being  build  at  the  state  and  local  level, 
interoperability  is  likely  to  be  a  major  problem.  The  construction  will  also  take 
longer due to the additional cell towers required. 

Only Frontline’s Plan will guarantee the construction of the much-needed nation-
wide,  interoperable  public  safety  network  within  10  years  and  without  any  cost  to 
public safety and taxpayers. 

Question  2.  Some  opponents  of  the  Frontline  proposal  have  argued  that  placing 
conditions  on  the  auction  of  certain  commercial  frequencies  should  be  rejected  be-
cause  it  would  reduce  potential  auction  revenues.  How  do  you  respond  to  this 
charge? 

Answer.  The  conditions  proposed  in  the  Frontline  plan—open  access  and  whole-
sale requirements on a nationwide license block—will encourage new entrants in the 
wireless market to bid in the auction, thereby increasing auction revenue. Open ac-
cess will promote bidding by entities with diverse business plans, some of whom will 
have no intention to provide retail service or otherwise bundle access, software and 
services. Even entities that already operate wireless networks may choose to partici-
pate.  Indeed,  in  recent  days  both  Verizon  and  AT&T  have  indicated  their  intention 
to bid actively in the upcoming auction, so claims that such conditions are a ‘‘poison 
pill’’  to  artificially  set  bid  prices  lower  by  keeping  incumbent  bidders  away  have 
proven to be false. 

A  wholesale  requirement  would  have  a  similarly  positive  effect  on  auction  rev-
enue.  By  unbundling  network  connectivity  and  retail  service,  a  wholesale  only  re-
quirement  reduces  the  significant  barriers  to  entry  that  have  caused  two  wireless 
broadband  incumbents  to  control  more  than  half  the  market.  If  barriers  to  entry 
into  wireless  broadband  service  are  not  mitigated  through  measures  such  as  open 
access  and  wholesale  requirements  on  a  small  part  of  the  spectrum  up  for  auction, 
incumbents  will  have  no  competitors  against  whom  to  bid—resulting  in  a  deflated 
price paid for that spectrum, and reduced funds to the Treasury. 

Frontline’s plan also seeks to encourage auction participation by new entrants by 
allowing eligible entities to qualify for bidding credits. Previous FCC auctions dem-
onstrate  that  where  new  entrants  and  small  businesses  participate,  greater  reve-
nues  result.  To  take  just  one  example,  in  the  Commission’s  PCS  auction,  bidding 
preferences  for  eligible  businesses  increased  the  government’s  revenues  by  more 
than 12 percent—an increase in total revenues of nearly $45 million. Giving bidding 
credits to designated entities created extra competition in the auctions and induced 
established firms to bid higher. By contrast, past auctions also show that where in-
cumbents  have  the  opportunity  to  bid  on  spectrum  without  any  limitations  on  its

100 

use,  other  potential  bidders  stay  home,  and  incumbents—those  entities  with  the 
most ability to pay—win their spectrum at a reduced price. 

Finally,  regardless  of  the  merits  of  the  by-now-discredited  position  that  auction 
rules  reduce  bidders’  flexibility,  which  in  turn  reduces  auction  revenue,  Section 
309(j)(7) of the Communications Act clearly bars the Commission from basing a find-
ing of public interest, convenience and necessity on the basis of such revenues. Con-
gress should make sure the FCC follows that provision of the law. 

Question 2a. Would there be benefits that might outweigh any potential costs? 
Answer.  As  noted,  the  benefits  of  the  Frontline  Plan  already  outweigh  potential 
‘‘costs’’  to  the  Treasury,  since  new  entrants’  participation  in  the  auction  has  been 
shown  to  increase  auction  revenues,  and  there  is  every  reason  to  believe  that  this 
truism  will  hold  in  the  700  MHz  auction.  To  the  extent  the  Commission  considers 
other  benefits  associated  with  the  Frontline  plan—as  the  Communications  Act  re-
quires it to do—it should find that open access, wholesale and promoting small busi-
ness  opportunities  are  all  consumer-friendly  policies  directly  in  the  public  interest. 
Simply  put,  an  open  network  benefits  consumers  more  than  a  locked  one.  Recall 
the  last  time  you  went  to  a  retailer  to  purchase  a  cellular  phone.  Most  likely,  your 
choice of phone was more or less dictated by your present service provider. Choosing 
a  network  circumscribed  your  choice  of  phone.  Prior  to  the  Commission’s  rule  on 
cellphone number portability—an action Verizon and CTIA vigorously opposed, chal-
lenged  in  court,  and  excoriated  in  the  press  as  unnecessary—the  barriers  to  choice 
were even higher. 

The  wireless  broadband  market,  as  presently  constituted,  results  in  even  greater 
costs  to  consumers.  In  a  highly  concentrated  market  (see  below),  companies  that 
control  access  to  both  the  network  and  the  consumer  collect  duopoly  rents  at  the 
retail  level  while  reducing  choice.  Unbundling  network  access  from  retail  service, 
however,  creates  several  new  points  of  entry  in  wireless  broadband  delivery  to  the 
consumer.  By  creating  opportunities  for  new  entrants  to  specialize  in  different 
areas,  benefits  will  inure  to  consumers  due  to  more  competition  and  lower  prices 
in  services,  software  and  devices.  Spurred  by  innovation,  broadband  networks  (and 
the benefits associated with them) will roll out faster. 

Consumers  don’t  participate  in  auctions.  Therefore,  the  Commission,  as  auction 
designer,  must  represent  the  interests  of  those  consumers  in  developing  auction 
rules.  Frontline’s  Plan  benefits  the  public  interest.  These  conditions  are  not  just 
beneficial, moreover; they are needed—a point illustrated in more detail below. 

Question 2b. In your view why are such conditions needed? 
Answer. These conditions are absolutely essential to create competition and inno-
vation  in  the  wireless  market.  Incumbent  providers  currently  operate  in  a  consoli-
dated  marketplace  that  has  essentially  become  a  duopoly.  The  Commission’s  most 
recent  CMRS  Competition  Report,  for  example,  found  that  the  wireless  industry’s 
HHI  index,  measuring  market  concentration,  was  2700,  up  from  2450  in  the  pre-
vious year alone. To put this in context, the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Divi-
sion  classifies  any  market  with  an  HHI  index  above  1800  as  ‘‘highly  concentrated.’’ 
Furthermore, the number of national wireless carriers has dropped from six to four, 
with the top two—AT&T and Verizon Wireless—accounting for nearly two-thirds of 
all new subscribers. 

Spectrum  is  a  scarce  commodity,  particularly  700  MHz  spectrum,  and  because  of 
market  consolidation  the  incumbent  retailers  have  a  monopoly  on  this  scare  re-
source. Control over this low-frequency spectrum provides control over network serv-
ices.  Incumbents  have  every  incentive  to  leverage  this  control  over  the  network  to 
corner  the  market  on  retails  services.  Consequently,  these  providers  will  rationally 
create  vertically  integrated  businesses  that  raise  prices  to  super-competitive  levels 
and thwart innovation and new entry. 

The  proposed  open  access  and  wholesale-only  conditions  will  prevent  incumbents 
from bottlenecking spectrum and continuing to hinder competition. If the FCC does 
not create a ‘‘new build’’ national network open to all content and devices, the likely 
outcome  is  that  the  United  States  will  fall  far  behind  other  countries  in  wireless 
broadband development and deployment. On the other hand, should the FCC decide 
to create rules requiring a licensee to operate a wholesale open access network, the 
result  will  be  a  vibrant  industry  as  dynamic  as  the  Internet  sector,  and  it  will  be 
headquartered on American soil.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

JAMES L. BARKSDALE 

Question 1. Current 700 MHz proposals seem to contemplate 24 MHz of spectrum 
for  public  safety.  Is  that  enough  to  meet  future  needs—particularly  in  light  of  new 
broadband applications? 

Answer.  Public  safety’s  communications  needs  reflect  the  nature  of  their  job, 
which is sometimes steady but is frequently punctuated by huge spikes in demand. 
That  makes  it  challenging  to  meet  public  safety’s  needs.  On  a  daily  basis,  public 
safety  will  not  utilize  all  of  its  spectrum,  let  alone  additional  spectrum.  In  emer-
gencies,  however,  public  safety  might  well  need  access  to  additional  spectrum.  This 
means  that  valuable  spectrum  will  sit  unused  much  of  the  time  but  public  safety 
still may not have sufficient access in times of emergency. 

This  problem  spurred  Frontline  to  propose  the  creation  of  a  public-private  part-
nership for a shared network on the public safety broadband spectrum and the adja-
cent commercial block. The beauty of Frontline’s proposed public-private partnership 
is  that  it  efficiently  utilizes  scare  spectrum  resources  and  simultaneously  helps  to 
solve spectrum shortages that may occur during public safety emergencies. 

Question  2.  Does  the  additional  10  megahertz  of  public-private  spectrum  in  the 

Frontline proposal help solve any shortage? 

Answer.  As  mentioned  above,  public  safety  will  not  typically  utilize  the  entire  12 
MHz  of  broadband  spectrum  it  has  been  allocated.  During  emergencies,  however, 
public  safety  may  need  access  to  additional  spectrum,  particularly  during  national 
emergencies.  Under  the  Frontline  Plan,  public  safety  will  have  instantaneous  and 
automatic  access  to  take  over  the  adjacent  commercial  spectrum  during  emer-
gencies,  approximately  doubling  the  amount  of  spectrum  available  to  public  safety 
when it needs it most and alleviating concerns about the insufficiency of the current 
public safety allocation. 

Question 3. As you are all aware, one of the biggest problems facing public safety 
is interoperability. All too often, we see jurisdictional and technological barriers that 
inhibit  public  safety  oficials  in  one  area  from  speaking  to  officials  in  an  adjoining 
area. Of the solutions currently before the FCC, which solution does the most to fos-
ter interoperability? 

Answer.  Frontline  has  proposed  a  solution  specifically  designed  to  address  the 
problems  associated  with  the  current  lack  of  interoperability  in  our  public  safety 
communication  networks.  Namely,  Frontline  has  proposed  a  public-private  partner-
ship to facilitate the construction of a nationwide, interoperable, wireless broadband 
network  for  the  public  safety  community.  This  network  would  be  built  at  the  ex-
pense of a national commercial licensee who would construct the network as a condi-
tion of the license. 

This  plan  presents  the  only  realistic  opportunity  to  facilitate  much-needed  inter-
operability  by  creating  a  solution  for  the  funding  of  a  such  a  nationwide  network. 
By  working  with  the  National  Public  Safety  Licensee  (‘‘NPSL’’),  the  commercial  li-
censee  would  be  able  to  construct  a  network  to  public  safety  standards  and  ensure 
interoperability throughout the nationwide network. 

Question  4.  If  a  public-private  partnership—of  some  sort—is  formed  to  manage  a 
portion  of  the  spectrum,  how  should  disputes  between  public  safety  users  and  pri-
vate entities be resolved? 

Answer.  Frontline  recognizes  the  importance  of  ensuring  that  the  NPSL  is  able 
to decide whom it chooses as its network sharing partner and successfully negotiate 
an  agreement  with  that  entity.  This  is  why  Frontline  proposed  service  rules  which 
would give the NPSL the freedom to negotiate an agreement with any network part-
ner,  while  having  a  guaranteed  option  via  one-way  arbitration  that  binds  the  D 
Block Licensee but not the NPSL. 

Under  Frontline’s  proposed  rules,  the  commercial  licensee  of  the  block  adjacent 
to  public  safety  would  enter  into  good  faith  negotiations  with  the  NPSL  to  form  a 
network  sharing  agreement.  Given  the  incentives  of  both  parties,  an  agreement 
would likely be reached without Commission intervention. 

If there are any remaining disputes, as a last resort, Frontline has proposed that 
these  be  submitted  to  the  FCC  for  one-way  binding  arbitration.  The  FCC’s  arbitral 
decision would only be binding on the commercial licensee and the NPSL would re-
main  free  to  walk  away  and  negotiate  with  another  party.  The  bottom  line  is  that 
the  decision  to  proceed  with  a  partnership  would  rest  solely  with  the  NPSL.  If  the 
NPSL does choose to walk away, provided the commercial licensee has acted in good 
faith  and  is  willing  to  abide  by  the  Commission’s  decision,  the  commercial  entity 
would remain the licensee of the adjacent block.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

PHILIP J. WEISER 

Question 1. All parties appear to agree on the need to build a broadband network 
for  public  safety.  However,  the  cost  of  building  such  a  network  and  the  length  of 
time  it  would  take  to  complete  varies  significantly,  depending  upon  the  approach

lows  the  Frontline  proposal,  where  a  national  public  safety  licensee  would  partner 
with  a  commercial  operator  to  build  a  shared  network  that  not  only  uses  12  mega-
hertz  of  existing  public  safety  spectrum  but  also  10  megahertz  of  commercial  spec-
trum  that  will  soon  be  put  out  for  auction.  Under  each  of  these  scenarios,  what  is 
your  best  estimate  as  to  how  much  it  will  cost  public  safety  to  build  and  operate 
a  next-generation,  broadband  network,  and  how  long  will  it  take  to  build  out  this 
network across the nation? 

Answer.  The  question  is  exactly  the  right  question  to  ask  and,  unfortunately,  I 
am  not  in  a  position  to  give  a  good  answer  to  it.  I  can  say  that  I  am  skeptical,  as 
my testimony explains, that public safety can develop, own, and operate such a net-
work  itself.  As  between  the  last  two  options,  it  is  fair  to  say  that,  in  principle,  the 
second option would require public safety to put up more of the money itself insofar 
as  third  option  uses  the  encumbered  spectrum  as  a  form  of  subsidy  to  support  the 
build-out of a next generation network. 

Question  2.  Mr.  Weiser,  in  your  testimony,  you  describe  some  of  the  benefits  of 
a  next  generation  architecture  for  public  safety  and  note  that  a  partnership  with 
a  commercial  provider  could  lead  to  a  more  efficient  use  of  spectrum  and  to  lower 
costs  through  greater  economies  of  scale.  Could  you  describe  why  a  partnership 
might achieve these benefits and why the status quo does not? 

Answer.  The  status  quo,  whereby  public  safety  agencies  operate  networks  for 
themselves,  involves  the  inefficient  use  of  spectrum  whereby  each  locality  builds 
networks  that  they  operate  for  themselves.  Moreover,  under  the  status  quo,  public 
safety  agencies  are  left  outside  of  the  commercial  ecosystem  whereby  large  econo-
mies of scale accrue to the users of commercial networks. By partnering with a com-
mercial entity and developing a network at a higher level, public safety can address 
both  of  these  two  failings—using  a  system  that  is  architected  efficiently,  uses  spec-
trum  more  economically  as  well  as  benefits  from  more  options,  more  enhanced 
functionalities, and cheaper equipment than is currently available. 

Question  2a.  Is  it  possible  to  quantify  how  substantial  these  benefits  might  be? 
Answer.  Such  a  study  is  no  doubt  possible,  but  I  am  in  no  position  to  offer  any 
substantiation  of  these  benefits.  By  way  of  anecdote,  however,  consider  that  ‘‘a  cell 
phone with voice, video, and data capability costs about seven times less than a pub-
lic  safety  digital  portable  radio  that  cannot  even  take  a  digital  photo,  much  less 
send  it  to  another  person.’’  Robert  Rouleau,  Connecting  Data  Networks,  PUBLIC 
SAFETY REP., Aug. 2006, at 98, 102. On the spectrum side of the equation, I cannot 
quantity  just  how  much  more  efficiently  a  shared  network  would  be  (as  opposed  to 
individual  local  networks),  but  it  would  be  very  substantial  and,  given  the  value  of 
spectrum  as  a  resource,  the  savings  to  society  from  more  efficient  use  of  spectrum 
would be considerable.

Question 1. Current 700 MHz proposals seem to contemplate 24 MHz of spectrum 
for  public  safety.  Is  that  enough  to  meet  future  needs—particularly  in  light  of  new 
broadband applications? 

Answer. As I note in my testimony, public safety agencies use spectrum in bursts, 
meaning that, for those times of emergencies, 24 MHz is unlikely to be enough. For 
other times, however, it will be considerably more than enough—particularly if pub-
lic  safety  networks  are  architected  and  operated  efficiently.  To  address  the  nature 
of  public  safety’s  usage  pattern,  a  shared  commercial/public  safety  network  capital-
izes  on  a  powerful  insight—when  public  safety  is  not  using  its  spectrum,  it  can  be 
used by a commercial operator. By contrast, when public safety needs access to spec-
trum, this network would enable it to receive priority access to additional spectrum. 
Consequently, the major policy challenge is not finding public safety more spectrum

that  needs  to  be  dedicated  exclusively  to  public  safety  agencies,  but  rather  devel-
oping a policy strategy that will facilitate the emergence of a new network that pro-
vides public safety agencies with access to the spectrum they need when and where 
they  need  it  as  well  as  with  access  to  modern,  Internet-based,  broadband  tech-
nologies. 

Question  2.  Does  the  additional  10  megahertz  of  public-private  spectrum  in  the 

Frontline proposal help solve any shortage? 

Answer. It does solve a shortage concern insofar as it virtually guarantees a com-
mercial  partner  that  would  be  willing  to,  when  necessary,  give  public  safety  agen-
cies access to additional spectrum when they need it. 

Question 3. As you are all aware, one of the biggest problems facing public safety 
is interoperability. All too often, we see jurisdictional and technological barriers that 
inhibit  public  safety  officials  in  one  area  from  speaking  to  officials  in  an  adjoining 
area. Of the solutions currently before the FCC, which solution does the most to fos-
ter interoperability? 

Answer. The interoperability challenge has both a longer term and a nearer term 
component  to  it.  On  the  long  term  front,  the  development  of  a  next  generation  net-
work—say,  one  spearheaded  by  a  public  safety  spectrum  licensee  in  partnership 
with  a  commercial  provider—can  provide  a  solution  insofar  as  it  promises  to  equip 
all  public  safety  agencies  with  compatible  equipment  and  network  access.  Over  the 
nearer  term  (i.e.,  while  such  a  network  is  developed  and  deployed),  there  are  two 
options  I  am  aware  of  for  addressing  interoperability  issues.  The  first  option  is  to 
equip  all  relevant  agencies  with  compatible  equipment—say,  Project  25  radio  sys-
tems.  I  am,  however,  very  skeptical  of  that  model  because  of  its  considerable  costs 
and  the  limited  functionality  of  such  equipment.  A  second,  and  to  my  mind  more 
appealing,  option  is  to  encourage  all  agencies  to  adopt  Internet  Protocol-based  con-
nections  and  interoperate  using  Internet-based  applications.  Such  an  option  can  be 
attained  through  the  use  of  Internet  gateways  accessible  through  legacy  radios  or 
by  adopting  broadband,  Internet  technology  directly  (say,  through  a  local  WiFi  net-
work  or  EV—DO  platform).  This  solution,  to  be  sure,  is  imperfect,  but,  at  least  on 
a  near  term  basis,  it  appears  reasonably  promising.  For  more  details  on  this  con-
cept,  see  Philip  J.  Weiser,  The  Aspen  Institute,  Clearing  the  Air:  Convergence  and 
the Safety Enterprise 24–25 (2006). 

Question  4.  If  a  public-private  partnership—of  some  sort—is  formed  to  manage  a 
portion  of  the  spectrum,  how  should  disputes  between  public  safety  users  and  pri-
vate entities be resolved? 

Answer.  This  concern  is  a  paramount  question  in  the  development  of  any  such 
partnership. As I see it, the public safety licensee and its commercial partner would 
need  to  develop  a  framework  that  ensures  that  both  parties  cooperate  effectively 
with one another. Such frameworks have numerous analogs in commercial relation-
ships and I believe that such an agreement can be developed in this context as well. 
Presumably,  the  agreement  itself  will  contemplate  a  dispute  resolution  mechanism 
(say,  arbitration)  and  I  would  expect  that  mechanism  to  be  the  most  effective  and 
expeditious one. Nonetheless, if the obligations of a commercial partner with an obli-
gation  to  serve  public  safety  was  at  issue  (as  contemplated  by  the  Frontline  pro-
posal), that obligation would ultimately need to be enforced by the FCC. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

PAUL J. COSGRAVE 

Question 1. All parties appear to agree on the need to build a broadband network 
for  public  safety.  However,  the  cost  of  building  such  a  network  and  the  length  of 
time  it  would  take  to  complete  varies  significantly,  depending  upon  the  approach 
that is taken. There are essentially 3 options. Option 1 is that public safety can try 
to build and operate this network itself at the local and regional level, as has tradi-
tionally been the case. Option 2 is similar to what was proposed in the FCC’s Ninth 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, where a national public safety licensee would part-
ner with a commercial operator to build a shared public safety commercial network 
using the 12 megahertz of spectrum already allocated to public safety. Option 3 fol-
lows  the  Frontline  proposal,  where  a  national  public  safety  licensee  would  partner 
with  a  commercial  operator  to  build  a  shared  network  that  not  only  uses  12  mega-
hertz  of  existing  public  safety  spectrum  but  also  10  megahertz  of  commercial  spec-
trum  that  will  soon  be  put  out  for  auction.  Under  each  of  these  scenarios,  what  is 
your  best  estimate  as  to  how  much  it  will  cost  public  safety  to  build  and  operate 
a  next-generation,  broadband  network,  and  how  long  will  it  take  to  build  out  this 
network across the Nation?

Answer.  It  would  be  exceedingly  difficult  for  the  City  of  New  York  even  to  begin 
to  estimate  the  costs  and  construction  times  associated  with  these  options.  Among 
other  considerations,  the  answer  depends  on  the  unique  network  construction  and 
operational  requirements  of  each  and  every  jurisdiction  to  be  served  by  the 
broadband  network.  It  would  also  depend  on  the  nature  of  the  network  itself—the 
technology,  spectrum,  coverage,  throughput,  security,  quality  of  service  and  backup 
power requirements, for example. Finally, in arriving at a cost estimate, it is impor-
tant  to  focus  not  only  on  the  costs  of  initially  building  the  infrastructure,  including 
real  estate,  but  also  the  costs  of  maintenance,  network  applications  and  associated 
end-user devices. 

As  for  New  York  City,  as  I  testified,  we  contracted  in  September  2006  with  Nor-
throp  Grumman  for  a  $500  million  high-speed  data  network  for  public  safety  that 
is  scheduled  for  citywide  deployment  by  March  2008.  The  New  York  City  Wireless 
Network  (‘‘NYCWiN’’)  will  enable  a  wealth  of  mobile  and  fixed  applications,  includ-
ing real-time video, rapid database lookup and the exchange of rich graphical infor-
mation. The cost of NYCWiN covers infrastructure and the integration of certain ap-
plications and end-user devices over 5 years of operation. 

Indeed,  the  uncertainties  associated  with  the  cost  of  building,  operating,  and 
maintaining  a  national  network  are  among  the  reasons  why  the  City  is  concerned 
about  utilizing  a  large  segment  of  the  700  MHz  spectrum  allocated  to  public  safety 
by Congress. If the proposed network does not succeed, then this valuable spectrum 
could  be  ‘‘lost.’’  Consequently,  notwithstanding  the  FCC’s  recent  Report  and  Order, 
the  City  believes  that  the  concept  of  a  national  network  must  be  analyzed  much 
more closely, and that a great deal of clarification is in order. 

Question 2. Mr. Cosgrave, you note in your testimony that New York City recently 
paid $500 million to develop a high-speed data network for public safety personnel. 
How many square miles does this network cover? 

Answer.  The  system  will  cover  approximately  the  320  square  miles  that  encom-

pass all 5 boroughs of the City of New York. 

Question  2a.  Is  the  equipment  for  this  network  interoperable  with  other 

broadband networks such as the one here in Washington, D.C.? 

Answer. The equipment being used is fully interoperable with all Internet protocol 
systems,  including  Washington,  D.C.’s  network.  The  City  of  New  York  required  the 
implementation  of  architectural  elements  that  conform  to  existing  standards.  The 
radio  system  is  based  on  the  international  standard  known  as  UMTS,  whose  foot-
print currently covers 80 percent of the world’s wireless users. Moreover, the entire 
infrastructure is based on Internet protocol, which will allow interconnection of this 
system with those of other cities using standards-based protocols. 

Question  2b.  If  other  jurisdictions  were  to  contract  for  similar  systems,  what 

would the cost be of building broadband networks across the Nation? 

Answer.  As  I  suggested  in  response  to  Question  1,  above,  the  costs  of  even  this 
particular  technology  would  vary  greatly  from  jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction  depending 
on such variables as network construction and operational requirements. New York 
City is building-out an infrastructure with approximately 400 sites, with redundant 
backhaul  and  network  operating  centers.  We  are  requiring  demanding  coverage, 
throughput, quality of service and backup power installations. We also must contend 
with  a  combination  of  tall  buildings  (or  ‘‘urban  canyons’’),  on  the  one  hand,  and,  at 
the same time, of covering a large geographical area. A jurisdiction with a different 
topography  and  different  requirements  would  face  different  costs  even  using  the 
same system.

Question 1. Current 700 MHz proposals seem to contemplate 24 MHz of spectrum 
for  public  safety.  Is  that  enough  to  meet  future  needs—particularly  in  light  of  new 
broadband applications? 

Answer.  No.  To  respond  to  the  ever  increasing  number  of  anti-crime  and  home-
land security-related needs, there has been substantially increased demand for wire-
less  network  applications,  which,  in  turn,  translates  into  a  fast  growing  need  for 
spectrum. New York City, and other high-risk jurisdictions, are continuing to experi-
ence  great  spectrum  challenges  to  meet  these  required  public  safety  services.  As  I 
discussed  in  my  testimony,  New  York  City  has  actually  been  required  to  go  to  the 
‘‘secondary spectrum market’’ to purchase spectrum at commercial rates. It is unac-
ceptable  for  our  taxpayers  to  be  required  to  bear  the  cost  of  purchasing  publicly- 
owned  spectrum  in  large  measure  to  meet  national  security  mandates.  Therefore,

we  strongly  urge  Congress  to  encourage  allocation  of  additional  spectrum  to  local 
public safety entities. 

Moreover,  I  should  note  that,  based  on  the  currently  available  information  about 
the  FCC’s  recently  voted,  but  yet  to  be  released,  Report  and  Order,  it  seems  that 
those  local  public  safety  entities  who  choose  not  to  participate  in  the  nationwide 
broadband  network  would  lose  half  of  the  24  MHz  of  spectrum  that  was  allocated 
to  them  by  Congress.  Finally,  even  for  those  public  safety  entities  who  do  sign  on 
to  the  network,  a  portion  of  their  24  MHz  of  spectrum  will  now  be  comprised  by 
commercial usage on a secondary basis. 

Question  2.  Does  the  additional  10  megahertz  of  public-private  spectrum  in  the 

Frontline proposal help solve any shortage? 

Answer.  While  New  York  City  appreciates  every  effort  to  make  more  spectrum 
available for public safety use, it must be noted that public safety would have access 
to this spectrum on a shared basis with commercial providers. Details regarding the 
nature of the network being contemplated, and how this sharing arrangement would 
work,  were  not  provided  in  the  Frontline  proposal  (nor  in  the  information  that  is 
available  about  the  yet  to  be  released  FCC  Report  and  Order).  Consequently,  I  am 
not  in  a  position  to  assess  whether,  or  to  what  extent,  this  10  MHz  of  spectrum 
might address the shortage of public safety spectrum. 

Question 3. As you are all aware, one of the biggest problems facing public safety 
is interoperability. All too often, we see jurisdictional and technological barriers that 
inhibit  public  safety  officials  in  one  area  from  speaking  to  officials  in  an  adjoining 
area. Of the solutions currently before the FCC, which solution does the most to fos-
ter interoperability? 

Answer. Prior to addressing the specific question regarding which of the proposed 
solutions might be preferable from an interoperability perspective, let me first touch 
upon  a  misconception  about  interoperability  in  the  context  of  emergency  response. 
Interoperability  does  not  mean  that  everyone  with  a  radio  or  data  device  must  be 
capable of communicating on the same frequency with everyone who has a radio or 
data device. This would lead to chaotic, rather than interoperable, communications. 
Interoperability  means  managed  access  via  pre-defined  protocols  within  a  dis-
ciplined command and control structure. Designated individuals, including command 
and  control  officials,  communicate  with  each  other  and,  then,  to  their  respective 
‘‘ranks.’’  Interoperability  requires  detailed,  advanced  planning  and  coordination  be-
tween  local  first  responders  to  implement  communications  protocols.  Consequently, 
in looking at any of the proposed solutions, it is important to bear in mind that hav-
ing  an  appropriate  network  infrastructure  in  place  (which  may  not  necessarily  re-
quire  having  all  users  on  a  common  frequency)  is  just  one  part  of  resolving  the 
interoperability  puzzle.  A  nationwide  network  is  not  a  ‘‘magic  bullet’’  to  achieving 
interoperability.  Most  of  the  required  work  involves  planning  at  the  local  and  re-
gional levels, prior to an event, to ensure that the appropriate agencies are commu-
nicating with one another in a coordinated manner during an emergency. 

Setting  aside,  for  the  moment,  the  practical  concerns  about  deploying  a  nation-
wide  network,  which  I  raised  in  my  testimony,  I  would  suggest  that  theoretically 
each of the proposals have the potential to contribute to improving interoperability. 
From  an  infrastructure  perspective,  the  key  to  ensuring  that  interoperability  be-
comes  a  reality  is  to  ensure  that  the  true  first  responders  (i.e.,  the  emergency  offi-
cials who command incident response) have control in designing the network in such 
a way as to meet their needs. Then, the work of developing the appropriate commu-
nication protocols is needed. 

Question  4.  If  a  public-private  partnership—of  some  sort—is  formed  to  manage  a 
portion  of  the  spectrum,  how  should  disputes  between  public  safety  users  and  pri-
vate entities be resolved? 

Answer.  The  City  does  not  believe  that  such  a  responsibility  should  be  delegated 
to  nongovernment  entities,  such  as  private  mediators  or  administrators,  nor  should 
all  such  disputes  be  resolved  at  the  Federal  level  without  input  from  local  entities. 
Given  that  many  of  the  disputes  will  involve  local  or  regional  matters,  any  dispute 
resolution  mechanism  must  allow  for  input  from  the  affected  local/regional  public 
safety  entities.  A  ‘‘top  down’’  approach  involving  only  a  national  public  safety  li-
censee and a national commercial licensee will not account for the legitimate needs 
of local first responders, who are ultimately the first on the scene in any emergency. 
The  FCC  must  establish  a  process  that  is  both  expeditious  and  allows  for  local 
input.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

RICHARD J. LYNCH 

Question 1. What lessons can be learned from the recent Advanced Wireless Serv-
ice  (AWS)  auction  about  the  proper  geographic  size  of  license  areas?  Should  we  be 
concerned  that  153  of  the  168  eligible  bidders  in  the  AWS  auction  failed  to  even 
bid  on  large,  Regional  Economic  Area  Group  licenses,  which  are  often  referred  to 
as REAG licenses? 

Answer.  An  important  lesson  to  be  learned  from  the  AWS  auction  is  the  value  of 
the  Regional  Economic  Area  Grouping  (REAG)  licenses  and  the  importance  of  a 
band plan that includes a mixture of license sizes, such as that just adopted by the 
FCC for the 700 MHz band. 

In the AWS auction, the demand for REAGs was much more intense than for the 
other, smaller license areas. The 40 MHz of spectrum that was auctioned as REAGs 
sold for an average of $.66 per MHz-POP. By contrast, Economic Areas (EA) licenses 
sold  for  $0.45  per  MHz-POP,  and  Cellular  Market  Areas  (CMA)  licenses  sold  for 
only  $0.39  per  MHz-POP.  Overall,  EA  prices  were  32  percent  below  REAG  prices, 
and  CMA  prices  were  41  percent  below  REAG  prices.  These  substantial  price  dif-
ferences demonstrate the strong demand for large licenses. 

Finally,  the  158  bidders  mentioned  above  were  primarily  small  and  rural  compa-
nies  interested  in  only  a  few  of  the  more  than  1,000  licenses  available  in  that  auc-
tion. The structure of the AWS auction was clearly successful in that, of these small-
er bidders, more than 100 actually won licenses. 

Question  2.  Does  the  AWS  auction  also  demonstrate  that  bidders  can  aggregate 
smaller license areas to create larger geographic footprints? Do smaller license areas 
result in a more aggressive build out of infrastructure within a license area? 

Answer.  To  a  certain  degree,  bidders  may  be  able  to  aggregate  smaller  licenses 
into  larger  geographic  footprints.  The  questions  are  how  efficient  will  that  be,  and 
will  the  bidder  be  able  to  aggregate  enough  spectrum  to  implement  its  business 
plan? 

In  an  auction  with  only  small  licenses,  bidders  wanting  to  implement  a  nation-
wide or regional strategy would be hampered by the exposure problem. That is, bid-
ders  would  not  be  able  to  aggregate  their  preferred  combination  of  licenses,  either 
winning  licenses  that  they  do  not  need  or  not  winning  licenses  they  do  need.  If  a 
band plan includes a mix of licenses, both large and small bidders benefit. 

A  band  plan  of  all  small  licenses  could,  in  fact,  impede  an  aggressive  buildout. 
At  least  some  large  licenses  in  the  mix  will  help  promote  nationwide  deployment 
of new technologies by creating greater economies of scope and scale, which, in turn, 
result in lower prices for consumers. 

Band  plans  of  smaller  licenses  will  likely  result  in  an  uneven  and  even  illogical 
coverage for the consumer. This happens because each individual licensee will build 
out  to  optimize  the  one  specific  license  he/she  holds.  Since  the  typical  consumer 
knows  nothing  of  license  boundaries  and  is  only  looking  for  contiguous  coverage, 
such ‘‘Swiss cheese’’ coverage will frustrate the consumer. We have experienced this 
for years with current licenses and it is one of the big drivers for why some carriers, 
attempting to be responsive to consumer frustration, attempt to buy smaller licenses 
and eliminate the ‘‘Swiss cheese’’ holes. With larger licenses, logical and contiguous 
build  outs  can  be  achieved  much  sooner  and  will  minimize  such  customer  frustra-
tions. 

History  has  also  shown,  almost  without  exception,  that  carriers  aggregate  small-
er-sized licenses so that they can achieve and operate as viable businesses, enabling 
them  to  compete  and  deliver  better  products  at  lower  prices  to  consumers.  Aggre-
gating  spectrum  post  auction  takes  many  years  and  is  expensive  to  carriers  and 
costly  to  consumers.  To  avoid  these  costly  delays  and  ensure  that  next  generation 
wireless  networks  are  a  near-term  reality,  the  FCC  must  auction  and  license  suffi-
cient spectrum on a REAG basis. 

Question  3.  If  one  goal  of  the  auction  of  700  megahertz  spectrum  is  to  encourage 

FCC auction history shows us that there is not as much demand for CMAs as for 
larger  licenses.  Not  only  did  the  large  AWS  licenses  sell  for  more  per  MHz-POP 
than  the  small  licenses,  but  it  took  three  separate  auctions  to  sell  the  12  MHz 
CMAs  that  the  FCC  sold  in  the  lower  700  MHz  band.  At  the  first  auction  of  these 
licenses,  which  the  FCC  held  the  in  2002  at  the  request  of  small  businesses  and 
rural telcos, more than one-third of the licenses didn’t receive a bid. 

bidder participation, would smaller block sizes help in that regard? 

Answer. The band plan that the Commission just adopted for 700 MHz should be 

more than enough licenses to encourage bidder participation.

Question 4. Given recent testimony before the Committee regarding the spotty na-
ture  of  wireless  coverage  in  places  like  Maine,  what  mechanisms  can  the  FCC  use 
to ensure that new operators extend coverage ubiquitously? What effect would a so- 
called  ‘‘keep-what-you-use’’  mechanism  have  in  which  a  licensee  would,  over  a  rea-
sonable  period  of  time,  be  required  to  either  provide  service  or  return  parts  of  a  li-
cense area to the Commission for reauction? 

Answer.  Service  to  rural  areas  is  not  blocked  by  lack  of  spectrum,  and  as  such 
a  ‘‘keep  what  you  use’’  or  benchmark  requirements  would  do  little  to  extend  cov-
erage  into  more  rural  areas.  In  most  rural  areas,  it  is  not  economically  feasible  to 
make  use  of  all  spectrum  in  every  square  mile  of  geography  according  to  a  regu-
latory  mandated  timetable.  It  is  unlikely  that  services  to  rural  areas  are  being  de-
nied  or  unreasonably  delayed  because  interested  entities  lack  access  to  spectrum. 
Rather, a lack of market incentives to build-out a network is the real problem. 

We believe that marketplace dynamics—not prescriptive regulation—have worked 
to  extend  service  in  rural  areas.  Wireless  carriers  build  out  where  people  are.  In-
deed, rural wireless coverage has continued to expand and investment in rural areas 
has  continued  to  grow  long  after  the  original  cellular  licensees  were  required  to 
build out their networks or lose parts of their geographic area licenses. 

The Commission has other tools at its disposal that are better suited to encourage 
rural  deployment.  The  Commission’s  substantial  service  safe  harbors,  for  example, 
provide  increased  certainty  for  how  carriers  can  meet  the  substantial  service  re-
quirement through deployment in rural areas. 

If  Congress  believes  that  the  current  pace  of  deployment  in  rural  America  still 
lags  behind  its  goals,  then  it  would  be  far  more  effective  to  direct  the  Commission 
to use the economic tools at its disposal, rather than a policy of seizing unbuilt spec-
trum.  The  FCC  could  award  bidding  credits  for  carriers  who  choose  to  meet  their 
substantial  service  requirement  through  the  rural  area  safe  harbor.  Or  the  FCC 
could  develop  a  program  similar  to  programs  available  to  rural  utilities,  designed 
to target areas for wireless investment. 

Question  5.  Are  the  commercial  frequencies  that  will  be  made  available  in  the 
upper  and  lower  700  megahertz  bands  equally  viable  for  mobile  broadband  uses? 
Does  the  fact  that  the  Commission  may  allow  high-power  operations  in  certain 
blocks of the lower 700 megahertz band frequencies raise any concerns about inter-
ference  in  adjacent  blocks?  Would  larger  license  areas  in  the  lower  700  megahertz 
band be as attractive as large license areas in the upper 700 megahertz band? 

Answer.  The  upper  and  lower  700  MHz  bands  have  comparable  characteristics 
that  would  enable  them  to  be  used  for  mobile  broadband  systems  and  to  provide 
wide-area  and  in-building  coverage.  Both  would  also  facilitate  more  economical  de-
ployment  in  rural  areas,  as  compared  to  existing  spectrum  bands  used  for  commer-
cial mobile systems (850 MHz cellular and 1.9 GHz PCS). 

Operation  of  high-powered  broadcast  systems  can  cause  harmful  interference  to 
commercial  mobile  systems  if  operated  in  close  physical  proximity.  This  problem  is 
especially acute if both systems use the same radio spectrum, e.g., operating on the 
same  channel  in  adjacent  markets.  However,  there  is  also  a  potential  for  inter-
ference if the two disparate systems operate on adjacent spectrum. The Commission 
recognized  the  incompatibility  of  mobile  and  broadcast  systems  when  it  adopted  its 
recent Report and Order in April of this year. At that time, it modified its 700 MHz 
rules to prohibit the lower A and B blocks from being used for high-power broadcast 
services.  (Note:  The  lower  C  and  D  block  licenses,  which  have  already  been  auc-
tioned, and the unauctioned and unpaired E block may continue to be used for high- 
powered  systems).  These  changes  will  reduce  the  potential  for  interference  in  the 
lower 700 MHz band and will make the band significantly more suitable for mobile 
broadband systems. 

Verizon  Wireless  believes  that  larger  license  areas  provide  significant  benefits 
over  smaller  areas,  regardless  of  whether  they  are  made  available  in  the  lower  or 
upper 700 MHz bands. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN F. KERRY TO 

RICHARD J. LYNCH 

Question  1.  If  Verizon  plans  to  fully  use  spectrum  won  in  the  700  MHz  auction, 

then why does it oppose ‘‘use it or lose it’’ rules? 

Answer.  Verizon  Wireless  is  committed  to  rapid  roll-out  of  services.  We  believe 
that  micro-managing  carrier  build-out  goes  against  everything  we  have  learned 
about market-based regulation. 

In  particular,  geographic  coverage  and  so-called  ‘‘use  it  or  lose  it’’  or  ‘‘keep  what 
you  use’’  mandates  could  be  in  conflict  with  the  FCC’s  market-driven  policies  for

CMRS.  That  being  said,  in  the  recent  700  MHz  proceeding,  we  opposed  strict  geo-
graphic  build  out  requirements  as  unnecessary,  believing  that  such  rules  would 
skew  economic  investment  to  the  ultimate  detriment  of  the  consumer,  but  actually 
proposed a build out rule with a ‘‘keep what you use’’ component. 

Our  build-out  proposal  for  the  700  MHz  spectrum  was  more  stringent  than  any 
other  build-out  requirement  imposed  by  the  FCC  on  commercial  market  area  li-
censes. 

We proposed a population-based build out with a provision that if the licensee did 
not reach at least 75 percent of the POPS in its area at the end of its license term, 
it would lose the entire uncovered area of its license. 

A  population  based  coverage  requirement  can  promote  a  faster  build  out  because 
the operator is generating revenue from serving people instead of a designated land 
mass. The revenue generated helps the operator fund more build out in the licensed 
area. 

Question  2.  Do  you  think  competition  in  the  wireless  market  has  been  good  for 
consumers?  Do  you  think  it  has  been  good  for  the  industry?  What  do  you  make  of 
the  vertical  consolidation  in  the  wireless  industry,  can  the  market  still  be  competi-
tive in these circumstances? 

Answer.  Competition  has  been  a  boon  to  consumers.  In  its  annual  report  to  Con-
gress  on  the  state  of  competition  in  the  wireless  industry,  the  FCC  has  chronicled 
the positive impact of competition on the consumer. Most notable is that since 1995, 
the  price  of  service  has  dropped  precipitously,  from  $.43  per  minute  to  $.07  per 
minute in 2005. This price drop is only the tip of the iceberg—in 1995, the consumer 
had minimal choices in terms of carriers, handsets and services. Now there is much 
more  available  to  the  U.S.  wireless  consumers,  in  terms  of  coverage,  devices,  and 
advanced services. 

There  is  no  vertical  integration  in  the  wireless  industry  similar  to  the  vertically 
integrated  AT&T/Western  Electric  relationship  at  the  time  of  the  FCC’s  Carterfone 
decision.  In  fact,  no  wireless  service  provider  in  the  United  States  manufactures 
wireless devices and the market for those devices is fiercely competitive. Across the 
United States, there are currently more than 800 wireless phones and devices avail-
able  to  consumers,  from  nearly  three  dozen  manufacturers.  The  four  national  wire-
less  carriers  currently  offer  a  total  of  more  than  100  phones,  95  percent  of  which 
are unique to a single provider. 

A  number  of  innovative  new  devices,  by  new  manufacturers,  such  as  Apple’s 
iPhone  and  HP’s  iPAQ  Voice  Messenger  are  entering  the  market.  Major  handset 
manufacturers  like  Motorola  are  facing  an  extremely  competitive  environment  and 
face  strong  pressure  to  keep  prices  low  while  continuing  to  innovate.  Wireless  car-
riers must compete vigorously to provide consumers with the most advanced and de-
sired  devices,  given  the  carrier’s  particular  business  model,  technology  constraints, 
and the competitive availability of various phones. 

Question 3. If Verizon and other incumbent broadband service providers win most 
of the auctioned spectrum, is there any guarantee that a third broadband competitor 
will be able to enter the market? 

Answer.  Multiple  wireless  carriers,  both  with  and  without  ties  to  incumbent 
LECs,  are  making  enormous  investment  in  wireless  broadband  infrastructure  in 
various  parts  of  the  spectrum  today,  and  will  continue  to  do  so  in  the  recently  li-
censed AWS spectrum and soon to be auctioned 700 MHz spectrum. 

Verizon Wireless invested billions to deploy its EV–DO Rev. A wireless broadband 
service  on  its  currently  licensed  spectrum.  Moreover,  CTIA  reports  that  other  car-
riers deploying high-speed offerings include: Sprint (EV–DO covering more than 200 
million  people  now  and  rising  to  280  million  by  the  end  of  next  year);  Alltel  (EV– 
DO  to  more  than  44  million  people  in  more  than  100  cities);  AT&T  (HSDPA  to  73 
of the top 100 markets); T-Mobile (deploying HSDPA). 

Sprint  has  begun  constructing  a  next-generation  mobile  wireless  broadband  net-
work  (WiMax)  that  it  claims  will  reach  100  million  consumers  by  the  end  of  2008. 
It  just  announced  that  it  would  be  joining  with  startup  wireless-Internet  firm 
Clearwire  Corp.,  founded  by  telecom  pioneer  Craig  McCaw,  in  building  what  would 
be the Nation’s first mobile network based on fast WiMax technology. 

Cable companies, which were major license winners in the 2006 spectrum auction, 
plan  to  deploy  next-generation  wireless  services  to  complement  their  current 
broadband offerings. 

Companies such as T-Mobile, Earthlink, Google, and even AT&T are investing in 
the  deployment  of  WiFi.  It  is  therefore  no  surprise  that  WiFi  is  more  prevalent  in 
the United States than anywhere else in the world, with the United States, account-
ing for approximately one-third of all WiFi hot spots worldwide.

Question  4.  What  are  your  plans  to  deploy  broadband  to  rural  and  underserved 
communities?  How  will  you  build  out  your  network  to  ensure  all  Americans  are 
served? 

Answer. Verizon Wireless continues to expand its coverage in rural America both 
through  aggressive  build  out  of  our  existing  licenses  as  well  as  acquisition  of  rural 
licenses and customers. 

Nearly  half  the  counties  where  Verizon  Wireless  has  substantial  coverage  (defin-
ing  substantial  as  covering  more  than  25  percent  of  the  geography  of  the  county) 
are ‘‘rural’’ under the FCC’s definition of less than 100 people per square mile. 

We  recently  acquired  several  properties  in  rural  West  Virginia  and  just  an-
nounced the acquisition of Rural Cellular Corporation, a company that built its busi-
ness on serving rural areas across the country. 

Not  just  Verizon  Wireless,  but  all  carriers  continue  to  spend  capital  and  build 
throughout  the  United  States,  including  rural  America.  The  FCC’s  reports  to  Con-
gress indicate that carriers spent $25 billion on capital expenditures in 2005, a sub-
stantial  increase  over  2004.  That  same  report  documented  that  98  percent  of  the 
U.S.  population  lives  in  counties  with  three  or  more  mobile  carriers.  Without  regu-
latory mandates, carriers continue to invest in extending the scale and scope of their 
networks  and  those  networks—including  advanced  services—are  reaching  the  Na-
tion’s rural population. 

Question  5.  Do  you  think  that  your  customers  should  be  free  to  use  any  device 
on your wireless networks, provided that the device is certified to not harm the net-
work? 

Answer.  We  have  concerns  about  attaching  subscriber-supplied  devices  to  the 

Verizon Wireless network. 

Putting aside generally recognized harms such as radio interference to other users 
and  viruses,  snoopware,  and  malware,  we  would  have  concerns  about  devices  that 
demand a disproportionate amount of scarce spectrum resources. Such devices make 
it more difficult and more expensive for us to serve other users. We would also have 
concerns  about  devices  that  are  not  E–911  compliant,  or  may  not  meet  other  regu-
latory obligations that are the carrier’s responsibility under the FCC rules. 

Finally,  a  very  important  part  of  our  internal  device  certification  process  is 
achieving  a  high  quality  user  experience.  If  use  of  a  foreign  device  fails  to  satisfy 
a consumer, the network operator may still be blamed, and for something it cannot 
fix. That’s not how Verizon Wireless has achieved the high marks for customer sat-
isfaction that we enjoy today. We provide reliability and a superior user experience, 
and we would like to continue to do so, even if subscribers are allowed to bring for-
eign devices to the network. 

Question  6.  How  would  anonymous  bidding  prevent  anti-competitive  behavior, 

thereby increasing auction revenue? 

Answer. We are pleased that the Commission appears to have adopted anonymous 

bidding rules without an ‘‘eligibility ratio threshold’’ for the 700 MHz auction. 

Imposing limitations on the release of bidder information prior to and during the 
course  of  an  auction  ensures  that  bidders  will  be  appropriately  focused  on  the  li-
censes and their value, not on other bidders and their bidding strategies. 

Disclosure of bidder information beyond that required to comply with the Commis-
sion’s  rules  is  at  best  unnecessary  and,  at  worst,  may  facilitate  bid  signaling  or 
other collusive behavior. 

Anonymous  bidding  rules  will  prevent  strategies  whose  sole  purpose  is  to  block 

a bidder from aggregating licenses at auction.

RICHARD J. LYNCH 

Question.  Proponents  of  all  open  access  policy  for  portions  of  the  700  megahertz 
spectrum have noted that open access could bring about new innovative technologies 
and  applications.  Can  the  members  of  the  panel  provide  some  examples  of  these 
technologies  and  applications?  Also,  are  there  any  pitfalls  of  an  ‘‘open  access’’  ap-
proach? 

Answer.  I  assume  that  by  ‘‘open  access’’  you  refer  to  the  proposal  that  a  wireless 
carrier  must  permit  users  to  attach  devices  of  their  choosing,  with  applications  of 
their  choosing,  to  the  licensee’s  network.  Open  access  requirements  risk  significant 
harm to the network which negatively impacts the quality of service provided to our 
customers. 

Open  access  requirements  could  impair  the  ability  of  the  carrier  to  manage  its 
network  to  accomplish  essential  tasks  such  as  maximizing  spectrum  efficiency  and 
optimizing service quality. Open access will present the carrier with numerous net-

110 

work operational problems that must be resolved for the ‘‘open’’ regime. Open access 
could  take  away  the  carrier’s  ability  to  use  proprietary  network  applications  and 
controls  that  would  limit  the  introduction  of  viruses,  malware  and  snoopware,  and 
prevent illegal downloads and invasions of subscriber privacy. 

Currently, wireless devices and networks are designed to work closely to optimize 
reliable performance, spectrum efficiency, and network security. Moreover, the inte-
gration  of  devices  and  network  has  allowed  Congress  and  the  FCC  to  achieve  nu-
merous  public  interest  goals,  including  deployment  of  wireless  E–911  and  wireless 
number portability, increased availability of hearing aid compatible wireless devices, 
and,  most  recently,  the  future  availability  of  wireless  emergency  alerts  pursuant  to 
the WARN Act. If a user can supply a device to attach to the network, and can de-
cide what features and functions to download to the device, there is simply no guar-
antee  that  resulting  device  will  not  degrade  network  performance  or  will  comply 
with these regulatory mandates. 

Consumers  will  also  likely  see  increased  prices  for  ‘‘open’’  devices.  Currently,  we 
offer  subsidies  to  subscribers  for  handsets  that  are  designed  and  certified  to  work 
on our network. When consumers buy handsets from others they will likely pay full 
retail prices a significant increase over what consumers pay today. 

‘‘Open  access’’  proposals  present  significant  problems  because  they  ignore  the 
enormous  efforts  and  resources  that  a  wireless  network  operator  must  expend  in 
order to provide a secure environment and reliable network performance. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO 

RICHARD J. LYNCH 

Question  1.  You  advocate  large  license  blocks  and  large  geographic  areas.  Will 
that approach advantage large companies and disadvantage new entrants who can’t 
afford  to  bid  on  such  large  blocks  or  does  your  plan  have  sufficient  flexibility  to 
serve both? 

Answer.  The  700  MHz  band  plan  recommended  by  Verizon  Wireless  contains  a 
mix of licenses for large and small service areas as well as large and small spectrum 
blocks.  This  approach  provides  opportunities  for  companies  of  all  sizes,  existing  op-
erators  or  new  entrants,  to  acquire  spectrum  and  pursue  their  specific  business 
plans.  The  Commission  appears  to  have  adopted  a  plan  that  takes  such  an  ap-
proach. 

The  FCC’s  past  auctions  have  demonstrated  the  benefits  of  both  large  spectrum 
blocks  and  large  market  sizes.  The  recent  Advanced  Wireless  Service  auction,  con-
cluded last summer, used a broad mix of licenses and was very successful. 

Larger  spectrum  blocks  are  important  to  enable  operators  to  use  4G  technologies 
to  provide  the  greatest  possible  benefit  for  consumers.  A  20  MHz  or  larger  block, 
for example, is needed, to provide the fastest data rates possible. 

Larger  licenses  will  help  promote  nationwide  deployment  of  new  technologies  by 
creating  greater  economies  of  scope  and  scale,  which,  in  turn,  result  in  less  expen-
sive equipment and lower prices for consumers. 

Consumers demand nationwide service and carriers must meet that demand. His-
tory has also shown, almost without exception, that carriers aggregate smaller-sized 
licenses  so  that  they  can  achieve  and  operate  as  viable  businesses,  enabling  them 
to  compete  and  deliver  better  products  at  lower  prices  to  consumers.  Aggregating 
spectrum  post  auction  takes  many  years  and  is  expensive  to  carriers  and  costly  to 
consumers.  To  avoid  these  costly  delays  and  ensure  that  next  generation  wireless 
networks are a near-term reality, the FCC must auction and license sufficient spec-
trum on a REAG basis. 

Question  2.  Some  have  argued  that  there  should  be  limits  on  bids  for  spectrum 
by  providers  like  Verizon  Wireless  in  order  to  make  way  for  new  market  entrants. 
How  would  Verizon  Wireless  use  the  700  megahertz  spectrum  in  addition  to  the 
spectrum it already controls? 

Answer. There is no basis for excluding or limiting participation of providers like 
Verizon  Wireless.  On  the  contrary,  we  and  other  wireless  providers  have  proven 
track  records  of  designing  and  deploying  highly  sophisticated  communications  net-
works. Every year in its CMRS competition reports, the Commission has pointed to 
the vigorous competition in the CMRS market that has resulted from the competing 
networks  built  by  these  and  many  other  companies.  Although  other  entities  could 
obtain  the  necessary  financial  resources  and  technical  experience  to  deploy  such 
complex networks, there is no basis for barring current providers of communications 
services from the auction. 

We make the best possible use of the limited cellular and PCS spectrum we have 
and  believe  we  are  the  most  efficient  spectrum  user  in  the  Nation.  In  fact,  Verizon

Wireless  uses  less  spectrum  to  serve  more  customers  than  any  other  carrier  in  the 
industry, 50 percent more customers per MHz than the industry average. Such effi-
ciencies will drive any future use of spectrum. 

The  upcoming  auction  will  enable  the  development  and  wide  deployment  of  new 
fourth  generation—or  ‘‘4G’’—wireless  technologies  and  services  that  will  yield  tre-
mendous benefits to consumers, businesses, and first responders alike. 

Verizon  Wireless’  mobile  broadband  network,  the  first  in  the  Nation,  is  available 
to more than 200 million people who can access broadband services on their laptops, 
e-mail on their PDAs, and V–CAST Video and Music on their wireless phones, sup-
porting  data  rates  of  hundreds  of  kilobits  per  second  and  a  wide  variety  of  mobile 
applications.  We  are  now  deploying  the  latest  enhancement  to  CDMA  technology, 
EV–DO  Revision  A,  which  will  increase  data  speeds  further  and  support  new 
broadband applications. 

New ‘‘4G’’ technologies are being developed that will support mobile data rates of 
tens of megabits per second. They will unleash a host of new broadband applications 
that  will  rival  anything  available  today  on  wired  broadband  networks.  Doctors  will 
be  able  to  access  medical  records  and  CAT  scans  wirelessly;  firefighters  will  have 
wireless access to images of building interiors and floor plans. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO

Question 1. What lessons can be learned from the recent Advanced Wireless Serv-
ice  (AWS)  auction  about  the  proper  geographic  size  of  license  areas?  Should  we  be 
concerned  that  153  of  the  168  eligible  bidders  in  the  AWS  auction  failed  to  even 
bid  on  large,  Regional  Economic  Area  Group  licenses,  which  are  often  referred  to 
as REAG licenses? 

Answer. The success of the AWS auction shows that the pool of potential bidders 
is largely interested in smaller markets. There are several reasons for this interest. 
First,  many  existing  carriers  seek  to  augment  their  spectrum  holdings  in  targeted 
areas to serve increasing demand for voice and information services. Other carriers 
seek incremental additions to their service footprints so they can exploit population 
shifts and development related to their existing licensed service territory. Some car-
riers  seek  to  exploit  markets  connected  to  their  existing  businesses  or  related  to 
their  presence  in  the  service  area.  These  carriers  often  believe  that  their  close  con-
nection  with  a  particular  area  gives  them  an  advantage  in  the  marketplace.  Those 
carriers  who  seek  very  large—or  even  national—markets  are  carriers  who  already 
have a nationwide presence. By definition, there are but a few of these carriers and 
designing  auctions  that  predominately  offer  large  geographic  license  areas  nec-
essarily reduces the number of bidders because of the acquisition costs, development 
costs, and lack of interest in large licenses by most bidders. 

Question  2.  Does  the  AWS  auction  also  demonstrate  that  bidders  can  aggregate 
smaller license areas to create larger geographic footprints? Do smaller license areas 
result in a more aggressive build out of infrastructure within a license area? 

Answer. There is no doubt that licenses can be easily aggregated. Since the intro-
duction  of  cellular  service,  assorted  carriers  have  aggregated  licenses  in  various 
combinations.  The  four  largest  wireless  carriers  each  acquired  their  extensive  serv-
ice areas through aggregation of cellular, PCS, and now AWS licenses. Nothing pre-
vents  further  aggregation  or  various  sorts  of  cooperative  arrangements  among  car-
riers to extend service areas and product offerings. 

Question  3.  If  one  goal  of  the  auction  of  700  megahertz  spectrum  is  to  encourage 

bidder participation, would smaller block sizes help in that regard? 

Answer.  Smaller  block  sizes  will  encourage  more  bidders  to  enter  the  700  MHz 
auction  because  these  bidders  can  match  territories  to  their  existing  markets,  to 
contingent  areas  where  population  growth  and  development  have  spread  from  the 
core  areas  of  existing  service  areas,  or  because  new  bidders  can  match  their  finan-
cial and business capabilities to the smaller territories. 

Question 4. Given recent testimony before the Committee regarding the spotty na-
ture  of  wireless  coverage  in  places  like  Maine,  what  mechanisms  can  the  FCC  use 
to ensure that new operators extend coverage ubiquitously? What effect would a so- 
called  ‘‘keep-what-you-use’’  mechanism  have  in  which  a  licensee  would,  over  a  rea-
sonable  period  of  time,  be  required  to  either  provide  service  or  return  parts  of  a  li-
cense area to the Commission for reauction? 

Answer.  The  problem  of  coverage  in  high  cost,  low  population  density  areas  like 
parts  of  Maine  and  elsewhere  is  a  financial  problem.  The  cost  of  building  facilities 
in these areas cannot be justified by the amount of traffic available to support them.

112 

There is, of course, a program in place to deal with this problem: the high cost pro-
gram  of  the  Universal  Service  Fund.  If  the  FCC  wants  to  ensure  coverage  in  these 
areas, it should continue to make USF support available to wireless carriers. 

Question  5.  Are  the  commercial  frequencies  that  will  be  made  available  in  the 
upper  and  lower  700  megahertz  bands  equally  viable  for  mobile  broadband  uses? 
Does  the  fact  that  the  Commission  may  allow  high-power  operations  in  certain 
blocks of the lower 700 megahertz band frequencies raise any concerns about inter-
ference  in  adjacent  blocks?  Would  larger  license  areas  in  the  lower  700  megahertz 
band be as attractive as large license areas in the upper 700 megahertz band? 

Answer.  Yes,  we  believe  that  commercial  frequencies  made  available  in  both  the 
upper and lower 700 MHz bands are viable for mobile broadband uses. Some parties 
have expressed concerns about the proximity of higher- and lower-power operations 
in  700  MHz,  while  other  parties  believe  that  proper  coordination  among  licensees 
and  power  limits  will  address  this  concern.  We  have  not  taken  a  position  on  this 
issue. We believe it is important to have a mix of both large and small license serv-
ice areas to accommodate a variety of potential licensees and services. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

MICHAEL SMALL 

Question.  Proponents  of  all  open  access  policy  for  portions  of  the  700  megahertz 
spectrum have noted that open access could bring about new innovative technologies 
and  applications.  Can  the  members  of  the  panel  provide  some  examples  of  these 
technologies  and  applications?  Also,  are  there  any  pitfalls  of  an  ‘‘open  access’’  ap-
proach? 

Answer.  There  are  at  several  pitfalls  to  the  open  access  approach.  First,  if  the 
winning bidders are required to open their networks to third parties to use any de-
vice or application of their choice and/or on a wholesale basis, potential bidders will 
naturally find the offered spectrum of less value as a result of these onerous condi-
tions and bid accordingly. Second, it is unclear how such a policy would operate. Are 
carriers to offer wholesale access to the networks they construct, or are they to lease 
the  bare  spectrum  for  which  they  hold  what  has  (up  to  now)  been  an  exclusive  li-
cense?  Because  wireless  networks,  in  general,  use  one  of  two  access  modulation 
schemes,  customers  are  still  limited  in  the  number  of  networks  on  which  their 
handsets  will  work  if  resale  of  network  access  is  what  is  intended.  Moreover,  even 
if  wholesale  access  to  bare  spectrum  is  intended,  the  result  forces  a  choice  between 
competing  access  schemes  if  a  customer  is  to  have  nationwide  roaming  capability. 
Finally,  wireless  networks  are  unique—and  quite  distinct  from  traditional,  circuit- 
switched networks—in that they dynamically share limited spectrum and constantly 
adjust  to  account  for  growth  and  load  factors.  Because  handsets  are  a  functional 
part of the wireless network, introducing additional variables in the form of untest-
ed handsets and applications would harm network performance, create interference, 
and  potentially  limit  carriers’  ability  to  comply  with  critical  obligations  such  as  E– 
911  and  CALEA.  It  is  important  to  note  that  in  this  shared  network  environment, 
a  single  device  or  application  can  interfere  with  other  users.  By  the  time  the  inter-
ference  is  detected,  however,  the  harm  to  the  network  and  other  users  has  already 
occurred  and  service  quality  to  consumers  suffers.  In  sum,  I  firmly  believe  that  an 
open  access  approach  is  deeply  misguided,  would  skew  investment  and  innovation 
to the detriment of consumers, and should be rejected. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO 

MICHAEL SMALL 

Question.  You  have  expressed  concerns  that  FCC  requirements  for  a  company  to 
‘‘build-out’’ and provide service to their entire spectrum area may not be economical. 
How  can  the  FCC  ensure  that  winning  bidders  use  the  spectrum,  and  do  not  just 
hold on to it to prevent competition? 

Answer.  Current  FCC  rules  require  licensees  to  meet  construction  requirements 
at various points during the term of their licenses. These requirements are generally 
focused  on  covering  percentages  of  population  in  the  licensed  service  area  and,  as 
such, reflect the financial constraints of a capital construction program. These rules 
should  be  continued  for  holders  of  700  MHz  licenses.  This  will  ensure  that  the  li-
censes  are  put  to  use  (and  not  warehoused)  and  provide  service  to  a  large  percent-
age  of  the  population  covered  by  the  license.  For  construction  of  facilities  in  high 
cost, hard to serve areas, the FCC should continue to allow wireless carriers access 
to  the  Universal  Service  Fund’s  high  cost  program.  Access  to  these  funds  requires

AMOL R. SARVA 

Question  1.  How  does  the  current  marketplace  for  wireless  services  affect  the  de-

velopment of wireless devices and applications? 

Answer.  The  wireless  industry  is  ripe  with  opportunities  for  innovation  and  eco-
nomic growth, but the ‘‘Big 4’’ carriers currently act as gatekeepers to block or deter 
many of these opportunities. An entrepreneur looking to create a new device or serv-
ice that somehow touches one of their networks typically must go through an unduly 
burdensome  ‘‘certification  process,’’  which  is  driven  more  by  the  carrier’s  own  self 
interest  than  any  legitimate  technical  considerations.  Consumers  have  lost  out  on 
the benefits of far too many innovations that failed to pass through the ‘‘star cham-
ber’’ of the wireless incumbents’ processes. 

Question 2. Is the trend toward wireless consolidation getting better or worse, and 
what effect would the adoption of an open access model have on competition in this 
area? 

Answer.  Wireless  consolidation  is  a  worsening  trend,  as  the  Sprint/Nextel  and 
Cingular/AT&T,  and  other  ‘‘mega-mergers’’  have  dramatically  changed  the  competi-
tive  landscape.  Today,  the  top  two  carriers,  Verizon  and  AT&T,  control  over  half  of 
the subscribers in the market. More importantly, they garner two-thirds of the ‘‘net 
additions’’  (i.e.,  new  customers),  so  their  market  power  is  increasing.  The  FCC’s 
most  recent  report  on  the  subject  found  that  the  wireless  industry’s  HHI  index— 
a  key  measure  of  market  concentration—has  reached  2700,  well  above  the  1800 
marker above which a market is considered ‘‘highly concentrated.’’ The HHI has in-
creased about 600 points in the past 3 years it has been measured. 

By  licensing  a  slice  of  spectrum  in  the  700  MHz  band  according  to  Open  Access 
principles,  the  FCC  could  substantially  alleviate  the  competitive  harms  of  this  re-
markable  consolidation.  Whereas  today  the  Big  4  carriers  can  choose  which  devices 
and applications succeed and which fail, with Open Access, entrepreneurs would be 
free  to  innovate.  The  only  limits  on  new  service  ideas  would  be  the  entrepreneur’s 
imagination, not the wireless operator’s Terms of Service. 

Question  3.  In  your  view,  how  would  such  a  model  be  commercially  viable  for  a 

network operator? 

Answer.  There  is  great  demand  among  consumers  and  businesses  for  a  network 
operated  according  to  Open  Access  principles.  The  incumbents,  and  particularly 
AT&T and Verizon, have resisted an Open Access model because they are vertically 
integrated  carriers  with  a  legacy  business  model  to  protect.  A  new  entrant  with  an 
Open  Access  network  will  not  be  constrained  by  these  concerns,  and  will  thus  be 
able  to  generate  substantial  revenues  from  device  makers  looking  to  add  network 
connectivity, rural telephone companies eager for a partner to assist them in deploy-
ing wireless service to rural areas, and consumers who seek freedom from long-term 
contracts with costly termination fees (to name a few). Highlighting the commercial 
promise of an Open Access model, Google recently indicated its intention to commit 
a  minimum  of  $4.6  billion  in  the  700  MHz  auction  if  the  FCC  adopts  ‘‘specific,  en-
forceable,  and  enduring’’  rules  for  an  open  platform  on  a  portion  of  that  spectrum. 

Question 4. What consumer benefits would you expect? 
Answer.  If  the  FCC  allocates  a  slice  of  700  MHz  spectrum  for  Open  Access,  we 
envision  a  wave  of  opportunity  in  services,  applications  and  devices.  These  innova-
tions  include  the  evolution  of  cell  phones  toward  ‘‘broadband  communicators’’,  the 
addition of wireless community features to portable media and gaming devices, and 
even  using  wireless  to  provide  cheap  connectivity  to  otherwise  ‘‘dumb’’  appliances. 
We  are  starting  to  see  these  kinds  of  devices  emerge  with  local  area  WiFi  capabili-
ties,  but  the  possibilities  are  even  greater  once  the  devices  can  access  the  sort  of 
wide-area  4G  networks  that  will  operate  in  the  700  MHz  band.  Open  Access  will 
also bring wireless consumers a wealth of choices akin to the services that they cur-
rently  enjoy  via  fixed  Internet  connections,  such  as  video,  user-generated  content, 
VoIP, and social networking.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN F. KERRY TO 

AMOL R. SARVA 

Question 1. Is there merit to the notion of ‘‘open access’’ and will it increase com-
petition  in  the  wireless  market?  If  so,  how?  What  companies  will  bid  in  this  type 
of system? 

Answer. Open Access is an antidote to the sorry state of competition in the wire-
less market. Today, consumers are largely limited to the services and devices hand-
picked  for  them  by  the  vertically  integrated  carriers  like  AT&T  and  Verizon.  But 
if  the  FCC  allocates  a  slice  of  700  MHz  spectrum  according  to  Open  Access  prin-
ciples, entrepreneurs will be free to bring new products and services to market. This 
means  that  a  consumer  won’t  be  limited  to  Verizon’s  own  offering  or  those  of  its 
business  partners  every  time  she  wants  to  watch  a  mobile  video,  download  a 
ringtone, or otherwise make a legitimate use of the network. 

In  terms  of  bidders,  we  expect  a  vigorous  auction  for  any  700  MHz  spectrum  li-
censed  with  an  Open  Access  framework  Indeed,  Google  recently  announced  that  if 
the  FCC  adopts  a  truly  open  platform,  it  will  commit  no  less  than  $4.6  billion  to 
the  auction.  Moreover,  even  a  bidder  for  a  small  geographic  license  will  value  that 
spectrum more highly if other licenses across the country are auctioned on an Open 
Access basis, as Open Access ensures that the bidder can access a national coverage 
area through roaming and other arrangements. 

Question  2.  Opponents  of  open  access  say  that  it  is  a  failed  business  model.  Do 

you agree? Did it fail in the wireline industry? If so, why? 

Answer. The Open Access principles to which we refer have been wildly successful 
in the wireline market. For decades prior to the FCC’s seminal Carterfone decision, 
consumers  were  prohibited  from  attaching  any  device  to  the  telephone  network  un-
less  it  was  expressly  sanctioned  (and  sold)  by  Ma’  Bell.  Basically,  the  phone  com-
pany kept competition at bay by arguing that it couldn’t keep phone service running 
without  ‘‘absolute  control’’  over  the  network.  Finally,  in  1968,  the  FCC  called  their 
bluff, and said that so long as a manufacturer shows that its device won’t harm the 
network,  there’s  no  reason  to  keep  it  out  of  the  hands  of  the  public.  As  a  result, 
we  got  the  fax  machine,  the  answering  machine,  the  modem,  and  billions  upon  bil-
lions of dollars of new economic productivity. Carving out just a small slice of spec-
trum for a similarly open network in the 700 MHz band can unlock a wave of entre-
preneurial energy for wireless and broadband users. 

Question 3. What benefits do smaller and rural wireless service providers have to 
gain  from  open  access,  that  they  will  be  denied  if  there  is  no  open  access  require-
ment? What types of services can be rolled out in urban areas to compete? 

Answer.  Smaller  and  rural  wireless  service  providers  will  especially  benefit  from 
Open  Access.  As  this  Committee  is  aware,  the  current  inability  of  many  rural  car-
riers  to  offer  a  national  roaming  service  has  stifled  their  ability  to  compete  against 
larger  carriers.  For  example,  in  comments  to  the  FCC  supporting  Open  Access  in 
the  upper  700  MHz  band,  Cellular  South  noted  that  ‘‘small  and  regional  carriers 
find it increasingly difficult, if not outright impossible, to negotiate high-speed data 
roaming agreements with national wireless providers.’’ Also, by attracting a new en-
trant, an Open Access framework will further the creation of a ‘‘third pipe’’ that will 
provide rural consumers with affordable and reliable broadband access. 

Open Access also holds promise for urban areas, where ‘‘on-the-go’’ consumers will 
obtain  access  to  the  same  wealth  of  choices  among  IP-based  applications  and  serv-
ices  that  today  they  can  enjoy  only  at  home,  the  office  or  their  dorm  room.  The  in-
creased  ability  to  bring  new  devices  and  applications  to  the  wireless  market  will 
particularly  benefit  the  economies  of  tech  centers  like  Silicon  Valley  and  the  Route 
128 corridor. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

AMOL R. SARVA 

Question.  Proponents  of  all  open  access  policy  for  portions  of  the  700  megahertz 
spectrum have noted that open access could bring about new innovative technologies 
and  applications.  Can  the  members  of  the  panel  provide  some  examples  of  these 
technologies  and  applications?  Also,  are  there  any  pitfalls  of  an  ‘‘open  access’’  ap-
proach? 

Answer.  In  short,  an  Open  Access  framework  can  deliver  to  the  wireless  market 
the  same  wealth  of  technologies  and  applications  that  today  consumers  can  only 
enjoy when tethered to their PCs at home or work. It means that a consumer won’t 
be limited to Verizon’s own, limited offerings or those of its business partners every 
time  she  wants  to  watch  a  mobile  video,  download  a  ringtone,  or  otherwise  make

legitimate  use  of  the  network.  Innovations  in  the  near  term  include  the  evolution 
of  cell  phones  toward  ‘‘broadband  communicators’’,  the  addition  of  wireless  commu-
nity features to portable media and gaming devices, and even using wireless to pro-
vide  cheap  connectivity  to  otherwise  ‘‘dumb’’  appliances.  And  just  as  no  one  could 
predict  that  we’d  get  the  fax  machine  and  modem  when  the  FCC  adopted  similar 
principles  for  the  wireline  market  four  decades  ago,  the  wireless  marketplace  will 
experience innovations that today we could barely imagine. 

The  only  pitfall  will  come  if  the  FCC  adopts  an  allocation  that  is  Open  in  name 
but  which  opens  loopholes  for  the  network  owners  to  lock  down  devices  and  block 
content  as  they  do  today.  As  Google  recently  explained  in  comments  to  the  FCC, 
the commitment to Open Access to which the licensee will be held must be specific, 
enduring, and enforceable.
