BACKGROUND
Overview

The  ISS  is  the  most  complex  international  scientific  and  technological  endeavor
ever  undertaken,  involving  the  United  States,  Russia,  Japan,  Canada,  and  10  na-
tions  of  the  European  Space  Agency.  One  of  the  fundamental  objectives  of  the  ISS
is to enable astronauts to learn how to live and work in space for long duration mis-
sions.  When  President  Bush  announced  his  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  in  2004,
he  made  completion  of  the  ISS  an  important  part  of  the  overall  exploration  initia-
tive. The ISS has been continuously crewed for over six years; a six-person crew ca-
pability is planned to start in 2009. At assembly complete, the ISS will have a pres-
surized volume of over 33,000 cubic feet and a mass of over 925,000 pounds.

Development and construction of the ISS has been a difficult journey. In addition
to schedule delays of its own, the ISS was severely impacted by the loss of the Shut-
tle Columbia and its crew. The ISS was in the midst of assembly when the accident
took  place.  Today,  construction  is  over  65  percent  complete.  Development  is  mostly
done and components only await their turn on the Shuttle manifest for on-orbit as-
sembly.  The  most  recent  additions  to  the  ISS  happened  in  March  with  the  attach-
ment  of  the  Canadian-built  Special  Purpose  Dextrous  Manipulator  and  the  Kibo
Japanese  Experiment  Logistics  Module—Pressurized  Section.  Later  next  month,
STS–124  will  take  up  the  Japanese  Experiment  Module’s  Pressurized  Module  and
the Japanese Remote Manipulator System.

The  retirement  of  the  Shuttle  currently  scheduled  for  2010,  will  cause  the  U.S.
to rely on partners such as Russia to provide routine transportation and emergency
crew  return  from  the  station  or  acquire  commercial  services.  That  period  of  time
during  which  the  U.S.  will  have  no  crew  transportation  capability  is  referred  to  as
‘‘the  gap.’’  While  NASA  is  encouraging  the  development  of  a  commercial  crew  and
cargo  capability,  the  availability  of  such  a  capability  is  uncertain  at  this  time.  The
Commercial Crew and Cargo Program is NASA’s effort to foster the development of
a  cost-effective  commercial  space  transportation  capability  for  the  post-Shuttle  Era.

Initially,  this  capability  will  be  used  to  carry  cargo  to  the  ISS;  future  options  could
involve  developing  a  crew  transportation  capability.  The  development  of  the  com-
mercial  cargo/crew  transportation  capability  is  being  funded  in  the  Constellation
budget managed by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD). While the
services  will  be  demonstrated  through  the  Commercial  Orbital  Transportation  Sys-
tems (COTS) project, the operational responsibility for the program will move to the
ISS program within the Space Operations Missions Directorate (SOMD).

NASA  is  seeking  partnerships  with  other  government  agencies  and  the  commer-
cial  sector  to  utilize  the  ISS  as  a  National  Laboratory,  as  designated  by  the  NASA
Authorization  Act  of  2005.  NASA’s  plan  for  the  ISS  National  Laboratory,  the  Na-
tional Lab Report, was submitted to Congress in May 2007. Interest in ISS use has
been demonstrated in the areas of education, human health-related research and de-
fense  sciences  research.  A  Memorandum  of  Understanding  for  ‘‘Cooperation  in
Space-Related  Health  Research’’  between  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)
and  NASA  was  signed  on  September  12,  2007.  This  could  be  the  first  in  a  series
of  Memorandum  of  Understandings  with  U.S.  Government  agencies  that  have  ex-
pressed interest in access to the ISS for research and development purposes. In ad-
dition,  NASA  issued  an  announcement  of  ‘‘Opportunity  for  Use  of  the  ISS  by  Non-
Government  Entities  for  R&D  and  Industrial  Processing  Purposes’’  on  August  14,
2007, and is planning to enter into several Space Act Agreements as a result.

Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Request

NASA’s  FY09  budget  provides  $2.06  billion  for  the  International  Space  Station
Program  under  the  direction  of  SOMD.  It  should  be  noted  that  NASA’s  FY  2009
budget has been restructured pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2008,
and is now presented in seven accounts. In addition, the budget estimates presented
in  the  FY  2009  request  are  in  direct  program  dollars  rather  than  in  the  full  cost
dollars  used  in  previous  Presidential  budget  requests.  From  a  direct  cost  perspec-
tive,1 the proposed FY09 budget for the ISS is an increase of $247 million from that
appropriated in FY08.

The ISS Program budget funds:

• ISS  operations.  The  FY09  request  for  ISS  operations  is  $1,755.4  million,  a
slight  increase  from  the  $1,713.1  million  enacted  in  FY08.  The  ISS  Oper-
ations  budget  funds  several  key  activities:  Program  Integration,  Multi-User
System Support, Avionics and flight software, and Launch and Mission Oper-
ations.
• ISS  Crew  and  Cargo  Services.  The  FY09  request  for  ISS  Crew  and  Cargo
Services  is  $304.8  million,  an  increase  from  the  $100.1  million  enacted  in
FY08. The purchase of ISS Cargo Crew Services was transferred from ESMD
to SOMD in the FY 2008 budget. The total available funding for the purchase
of cargo transportation services is $2.6 billion over five years.

Funding for research conducted on the ISS is included in the budget managed by
the  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  (ESMD).  The  FY09  request  for
ESMD’s  Human  Research  Program  (HRP)  is  $151.9  million  in  direct  program  dol-
lars. The HRP identifies risk for human exploration of space and measures to miti-
gate the risks. According to NASA’s Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Request, the HRP in-
cludes  $19.9  million  for  the  ISS  Medical  Project,  which  ‘‘includes  current  ISS  bio-
medical  research  capabilities  and  on-orbit  validation  of  next  generation  on-orbit
equipment medical operations procedures and crew training concepts.’’ ESMD’s budg-
et  request  also  provides  $168  million  for  Exploration  and  Non-Exploration  research
to  be  conducted  on  the  ISS,  free-flyers,  and  through  ground-based  activities,  of
which  $138  million  is  for  Exploration  and  $30  million  is  for  Non-Exploration  re-
search. Exploration research focuses on physical sciences in the areas of life support,
thermal control, fire prevent, detection, and suppression, and on fluid flow. Non-Ex-
ploration research supports fundamental research in the areas of material sciences,
fluid  physics,  combustion  sciences,  cellular  and  animal  research,  and  microbial  re-
search, among other areas.

1 As  part  of  the  Congressionally  directed  budget  restructuring,  NASA  shifted  from  a  full-cost
budget,  in  which  each  project  budget  included  overhead  costs,  to  a  direct  cost  budget.  All  over-
head  budget  estimates  are  now  consolidated  into  the  Cross  Agency  Support  budget  line.  NASA
has  stated  that  maintaining  a  full  cost  budget  with  seven  appropriations  accounts  would  be
overly complex and inefficient. The direct cost budget shows program budget estimates that are
based  entirely  on  program  content.  Individual  project  managers  continue  to  operate  in  a  full-
cost environment, including management of overhead costs.

Assumed Budget Growth for the ISS Program FY 2009–FY 2013

NASA’s  out-year  projections  for  the  ISS  Program  in  the  President’s  FY09  budget

request show minor funding level changes through 2013.

Key Challenges Related to the FY09 Budget and Five-Year Runout

Key  challenges  related  to  the  FY09  budget  request  and  five-year  runout  for  the

ISS program include:

• Low  level  of  program  reserves.  The  ISS  program  has  depleted  reserves
through  FY  2009  while  facing  the  most  challenging  period  of  ISS  assembly.
• Uncertain  status  of  the  two  logistics  flights.  Two  of  the  remaining  Shuttle
flights are listed as ‘‘contingency’’ and have not yet been approved by the Of-
fice of Management and Budget (OMB)—although NASA says sufficient funds
have been included in the FY09 budget request. NASA has indicated that the
two  flights  needed  to  deliver  spares  and  logistics  in  advance  of  the  Shuttle’s
retirement are necessary and of high priority.
• Cuts in research funding. Funding for ISS research has been cut back signifi-
cantly  over  the  last  several  years,  and  the  research  community  that  was  in-
tended  to  utilize  the  ISS  has  been  decimated  by  reductions  in  funding.  This
raises the issue of reduced opportunity to attract top research scientists in the
future.
• Export control restrictions. Current International Traffic in Arms Regulations
(ITAR)  restrictions  on  NASA  ‘‘are  a  threat  to  the  safe  and  successful  integra-
tion  and  operations  of  the  International  Space  Station,’’  according  to  the  ISS
Independent  Safety  Task  Force  (IISTF)  issued  in  2007.  The  Task  Force  also
found that workforce interactions must enable direct interfaces to assure safe
and  successful  operations.  These  interactions,  including  the  ability  to  ex-
change and discuss technical data relevant to vehicle operation, are hampered
by the current ITAR restrictions.

ISS Cargo and Crew Transportation Services in the Post-Shuttle Era

The Commercial Crew and Cargo Program is NASA’s effort to foster the develop-
ment  of  a  cost-effective  commercial  space  transportation  capability  for  the  post-
Shuttle Era. This capability will initially be utilized to carry cargo to the ISS; future
options  could  involve  developing  a  crew  transportation  capability.  The  development
of  the  commercial  cargo/crew  transportation  capability  is  being  funded  in  ESMD’s
Constellation budget. Once the services have been demonstrated (Phase 1), the oper-
ational  responsibility  for  the  program  will  move  to  the  ISS  program  within  SOMD.
As  the  Space  Shuttle  nears  retirement,  NASA’s  stated  preferred  solution  for  ISS
crew and cargo delivery and return requirements is to use commercial services pro-
vided  by  space  transportation  companies.  NASA’s  Commercial  Orbital  Transpor-
tation Services (COTS) project is intended to facilitate U.S. private industry’s devel-
opment  of  cargo  and  crew  space  transportation  capabilities  with  the  goal  of  dem-
onstrating  reliable,  cost  effective  access  to  low-Earth  orbit.  NASA  had  initially  se-
lected two partners for its COTS project under Space Act Agreements. One partner
failed to meet NASA’s milestones, and NASA terminated the Agreement. The other
partner,  SpaceX,  recently  announced  that  it  has  delayed  the  first  demonstration
flight for their Falcon 9 rocket for six to nine months. Following GAO’s decision re-
jecting  a  challenge  by  the  terminated  partner  to  NASA’s  plans  to  utilize  a  Space
Act Agreement rather than a government contract, NASA made an award to Orbital
Sciences Corporation in February 2008. Last week, NASA issued a Request for Pro-
posals  (RFP)  for  Phase  2  of  the  COTS  program,  now  called  Commercial  Resupply
Services, with a planned contract award by the end of the year. Both of the current
COTS partners are working only on cargo carriers.

If NASA’s preferred solution of using commercial services is not attainable by the
time  the  Shuttle  is  retired,  the  agency  has  indicated  that  it  will  rely  on
prepositioned spares to be sent up to the ISS before the Shuttle retires. In an inter-
view  in  Aviation  Week  last  week,  NASA’s  Associate  Administrator  for  Space  Oper-

ations  said  ‘‘We  recognized  that  there  may  be  a  little  bit  of  a  delay  in  the  delivery
of  those  [commercial]  services,’’  adding  that  ‘‘Our  plan  is  that  if  we  have  a  delay  we
would  live  off  the  spares  we  flew  up  on  Shuttle  and  take  some  limited  degradation
in space station capabilities until those commercial services come on line.’’ However,
this  poses  a  risk  since  the  last  two  Shuttle  flights  scheduled  to  bring  up  those
spares have not been approved by the Administration. As to the use of international
partner  cargo  capabilities,  NASA  said  last  week  that  it  will  not  ask  Congress  for
permission  to  continue  buying  cargo  services  from  Russia  after  2011.  European
Automated Transfer Vehicles (ATV) and Japanese H–II Transfer Vehicles (HTV) are
alternatives but would require some time to procure.

Regarding crew transportation during ‘‘the gap,’’ purchases of Russian capabilities
beyond  2011  will  require  an  extension  of  the  waiver  currently  granted  in  the  Iran,
North  Korea  and  Syria  Non-Proliferation  Act  (INKSNA).  Last  week,  NASA  notified
the Congress that it needs to continue using Russian Soyuz capsules to deliver crew
to  the  ISS  after  the  Shuttle  retires  in  2010  and  is  thus  seeking  an  extension  of
INKSNA waiver authority. A copy of NASA’s letter to Chairman Udall transmitting
the proposed waiver and the waiver itself are included as Attachment 1.

Research Objectives of the ISS

Although  one  NASA  objective  for  the  ISS  was  to  create  a  world-class  laboratory,
cost overruns, a decision to focus on a ‘‘core complete’’ configuration, the elimination
of  several  planned  research  facilities,  and  a  smaller  crew  size  led  a  National  Re-
search  Council  (NRC)  committee  to  conclude  in  a  2003  report,  Factors  Affecting  the
Utilization  of  the  International  Space  Station,  that  achieving  that  goal  was  ‘‘un-
likely.’’

• Following  President  Bush’s  announcement  of  a  Vision  for  Space  Exploration
in  January  2004,  NASA  reoriented  its  goals  for  the  ISS  to  focus  on  explo-
ration.

A  2006  NRC  report,  NASA’s  Plans  for  the  International  Space  Station,  identified
several priority areas of research to support NASA’s exploration goals, including ‘‘ef-
fects  of  radiation  on  biological  systems,  loss  of  bone  and  muscle  mass  during  space
flight, psychosocial and behavioral risks of long-term space missions, individual var-
iability  in  mitigating  a  medical/biological  risk,  fire  safety  aboard  spacecraft,  and
multi-phase flow and heat transfer issues in space technology operations.’’

In addition, the report recommended that NASA take several other actions in uti-
lizing the ISS to support exploration missions. For example, the NRC recommended
that:

activities as soon as possible.’’

• ‘‘NASA should develop an agency-wide, integrated utilization plan for all ISS
• ‘‘NASA  should  develop  and  maintain  a  set  of  operations  demonstrations  that
need  to  be  conducted  on  the  ISS  to  validate  operational  protocols  and  proce-
dures for long-duration and long-distance missions such as the ones to Mars.’’
• ‘‘NASA  should  plan  options  and  decision  points  for  obtaining  a  post-Shuttle
logistics  capability  for  . . .  demonstrating  the  technology  and  operations  that
will enable exploration missions. NASA should establish priorities and develop
back-up plans to enable the post-2010 deployment of large ISS structural com-
ponents  and  research  facilities  required  to  accomplish  exploration  mission  ob-
jectives.’’

In 2007, at the House Committee on Science and Technology’s hearing on NASA’s
Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Request, NASA provided material for the record noting that
NASA’s  research  use  of  the  ISS  aligns  with  the  Agency’s  needs  in  the  following
areas:

Human Health and Performance on Long-Duration Space Missions

• Research,  Development,  Test,  and  Evaluation  of  Biomedical  Protocols  for
• Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation of Systems Readiness for Long-
• Development,  Demonstration,  and  Validation  of  Operational  Practices  and

Duration Space Missions

Procedures for Long-Duration Space Missions.

Congressional Policy Direction on ISS Utilization

Congress  directed  in  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (P.L.  109–155)  that
NASA complete the assembly of the ISS and ensure its utilization for basic and ap-
plied research, as well as commercial research, and other benefits to the Nation. As
part  of  this  policy  direction,  NASA  is  to  sustain  the  necessary  scientific  expertise

to  support  research  in  disciplines  that  require  microgravity  environments  (e.g.,  mo-
lecular  crystal  growth,  animal  research,  basic  fluid  physics,  combustion  research,
and  cellular  research).  To  ensure  that  NASA  continues  to  sustain  basic  research  in
life and microgravity sciences, the Act directs NASA to allocate at least fifteen per-
cent  of  ISS  research  funds  to  non-exploration  research  conducted  on  the  ISS,  free-
flyers and ground. In addition, the Act designates the ISS as a National Laboratory
to ‘‘increase the utilization of the ISS by other federal entities and the private sector
through  partnerships,  cost-sharing  agreements,  and  other  arrangements  that  would
supplement NASA funding of the ISS.’’

Status of NASA Plans for ISS Utilization and Ongoing Utilization Activities

In  response  to  direction  in  the  2005  NASA  Authorization  Act,  NASA  submitted
a  report,  the  NASA  ISS  Research  and  Utilization  Plan.  The  nature  of  that  report
was high-level, and as a follow-up, NASA submitted three additional documents de-
tailing  NASA  plans  for  ISS  utilization:  1)  Human  Research  Program  Utilization
Plan  for  the  International  Space  Station,  2)  ISS  Exploration  and  Non-Exploration
Research  Project  Plan  for  the  NASA  ISS  Utilization  Plan,  3)  Consolidated  Oper-
ations and Utilization Plan 2007–2015. The first report identifies the human health
risks to be addressed by the ISS Human Research Program, for which 25 of 32 risks
require  research  on  the  ISS  to  mitigate  the  risk.  The  second  report  provides  a  top-
level  plan  for  ISS  research  to  support  NASA’s  exploration  objectives  (applied)  as
well  as  non-exploration  (basis)  research.  The  third  report  details  the  operational
plans  for  utilizing  the  ISS,  including  allocation  of  resources  among  partners.  An
overview  summary  of  these  documents  states  that  ‘‘human  biomedical  research  is
of  the  highest  priority  in  order  to  prepare  for  longer  duration  human  space  explo-
ration missions . . .’’

At  a  hearing  of  the  House  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  on  NASA’s  Fis-
cal  Year  2008  Budget  Request,  the  NASA  Administrator  testified  that  ‘‘we  are  still
building  the  Station,  and  its  full  capability  as  a  research  laboratory  is  mostly  in
front  of  us.  But  we  can’t  have  a  research  laboratory  until  we  get  the  power  and  the
water  and  the  air  conditioning  fully  in  place.  And  that  is  what  we  are  doing  right
now.’’  He  further  stated  that  ‘‘I  believe  it  [the  Station]  should  be  sustained  as  long
as  the  costs  of  its  operations  and  maintenance,  once  built  . . .  seem  to  be  justified
by  the  research,  which  is  being  returned  . . .’’  The  duration  of  Space  Station  oper-
ations has not yet been determined.

Upon  request  of  the  Committee,  NASA  provided  material  for  the  record  noting
that  NASA  has  conducted  17  NASA  Human  Research  Program  investigations  (the
ISS  component  of  that  research  was  complete)  which  supported  44  researchers
‘‘worldwide.’’  NASA  also  reported  that  there  were  16  investigations  of  the  Human
Research Program being conducted on the ISS in which 49 researchers ‘‘worldwide’’
were involved. NASA’s plans were to conduct nine Human Research Program inves-
tigations  over  the  next  year,  which  would  involve  25  researchers.  NASA  also  con-
ducts  exploration  and  non-exploration  research  on  the  ISS,  although  it  is  not  com-
pletely clear how many experiments have been flown or how many will be flown and
when.

ISS as a National Laboratory

As  directed  in  the  2005  NASA  Authorization  Act,  NASA  submitted  a  report  to
Congress  on  an  International  Space  Station  National  Laboratory  Application  Devel-
opment.  NASA  indicates  that  approximately  50  percent  of  planned  U.S.  utilization
resources  on  ISS  could  be  available  for  non-NASA  use  through  the  ISS  National
Laboratory. In August 2007, NASA solicited proposals for ‘‘Opportunity For The Use
Of  The  International  Space  Station  By  U.S.  Non-Government  Entities  For  Research
And Development And Industrial Processing Purposes.’’

ISS National Laboratory Partners and Prospective Partners

In  September  2007,  NASA  and  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  signed  a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for Cooperation on Space-Related Research.
The  MOU  will  foster  synergies  in  research  being  sponsored  by  both  agencies  that
will  help  ensure  astronaut  health,  especially  on  long-duration  missions,  and  yield
benefits for medical science on Earth. For example, research on the loss of bone den-
sity  and  muscle  mass  resulting  from  the  effects  of  microgravity  may  improve  treat-
ment  for  bone  and  muscle  diseases.  Better  understanding  of  the  effects  of  gravity
on  astronauts’  balance  may  increase  our  knowledge  of  conditions  such  as  vertigo,
problems  of  the  inner  ear,  and  dizziness.  Research  on  how  microorganisms  respond
to microgravity may also provide insights into the immune system’s response to in-
fectious diseases.

9

The  MOU  outlines  NIH’s  particular  interest  in  the  use  of  the  ISS  for  research  in

the following types of areas:

Æ ‘‘Basic biological and behavioral mechanisms in the absence of gravity
Æ Human physiology and metabolism
Æ Spatial orientation and cognition
Æ Cell repair processes and tissue regeneration
Æ Pathogen infectivity and host immunity
Æ Medical countermeasures
Æ Health care delivery and health monitoring technologies’’

A copy of the MOU is included as Attachment 2.
In  a  Fall  2007  issue  of  NIH  Medline  Plus,  Dr.  Stephen  Katz,  National  Institute
of  Arthritis  and  Musculoskeletal  and  Skin  Diseases,  said,  ‘‘An  enormous  amount  of
time  will  be  required  to  develop  the  questions  and  experimental  models  for  use  on
the Space Station. . ..’’ Members may wish to probe whether or not the Administra-
tion’s  current  plans  for  operating  the  ISS  until  2016  will  be  sufficient  to  accommo-
date the time NIH would need to prepare and carry out research investigations.

NASA is currently working on an MOU with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Potential  UDSA-sponsored  research  on  the  ISS  could  help  to  advance  knowledge  in
the areas of nutrition and animal and plant biology. Potential goals of the research
include  outcomes  that  could  provide  additional  benefits  in  assuring  food  safety  and
the quality of agricultural products.

SPACEHAB, a commercial company that provides space products and services, is
also  discussing  partnership  opportunities  with  NASA  as  part  of  the  ISS  National
Laboratory. The company announced in 2007 plans ‘‘to develop a new company divi-
sion  that  will  focus  on  manufacturing  pharmaceuticals  and  materials  in  space  for
distribution into the commercial marketplace.’’ Following on this path, SPACEHAB’s
January  28,  2008  press  release  announced  the  company’s  plans  to  use  the  ISS  for
‘‘research, development, and industrial processing purposes.’’ SPACEHAB’s past rela-
tionship  with  NASA  has  been  in  providing  pressurized  habitation  modules,  unpres-
surized  cargo  carriers,  and  related  space  flight  equipment  and  services  to  support
research  and  other  payloads  for  launch,  operation,  and  return  from  NASA  space
flight and ISS missions. In addition, SPACEHAB has an unfunded Space Act Agree-
ment  with  NASA  to  develop  (along  with  several  partner  companies)  a  commercial
transportation  system  (COTS)  to  provide  logistical  support  to  the  ISS  following  the
retirement of the Shuttle in 2010.

The  ISS  National  Laboratory  report  refers  to  ‘‘the  availability  of  cost-effective
transportation  services’’  as  the  most  significant  risk  for  the  success  of  the  National
Laboratory.  The  report  prepared  for  Congress  did  not  indicate  that  NASA  planned
to  provide  transportation  services  to  ISS  National  Laboratory  partners.  According
to  the  ISS  National  Laboratory  report  to  Congress,  NASA  plans  to  begin  managing
the operations and utilization of the ISS National Laboratory. NASA is also consid-
ering alternative approaches for managing the ISS national lab.

Readiness of the Life and Microgravity Sciences Research Community to Support ISS

Research

At  a  hearing  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics  on  ‘‘NASA’s  Space
Shuttle and International Space Station Programs: Status and Issues’’ in July 2007,
Dr.  G.  Paul  Neitzel,  a  professor  of  fluid  mechanics,  testified  that  ‘‘At  its  zenith,  the
budget of the then Office of Biological and Physical Research . . . had grown to ap-
proximately  $1B  and  the  FY03  OBPR  Task  Book  . . .  shows  a  broad  research  pro-
gram  containing  roughly  1000  tasks,  supporting  over  1,700  PIs  and  co-investigators
and  nearly  3,000  students. . ..’’  Following  the  Columbia  accident  and  the  Presi-
dent’s  announcement  of  a  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  NASA  reduced  the  size  of
the  life  and  microgravity  sciences  program.  ‘‘In  December  2005,  NASA  sent  letters
to  hundreds  of  investigators  in  the  program,  informing  them  of  significant  cuts  in
their  funding  for  FY06  and  the  termination  of  their  grants  effective  September  30,
2006.’’  Dr.  Neitzel  further  noted  that  ‘‘The  re-establishment  of  an  external  research
community will take years, if it can be accomplished at all.’’

Existing and Planned Research Facilities for U.S. Use on the ISS

The U.S. laboratory module, Destiny, houses several research facilities. These in-

clude the:

• Human Research Facility racks
• Microgravity Science Glovebox

10

• The Minus Eight-Degree Freezer for ISS that can store and freeze life science

and biological samples

• Expedite  the  Processing  of  Experiments  to  Space  Station  (EXPRESS)  racks,
which  can  provide  power,  data,  and  fluids  and  other  utilities  needed  to  sup-
port research experiments that can attach to the racks.

The  following  are  NASA  facilities  planned  for  inclusion  on  the  ISS,  and  most,  if

not all, have been manifested on upcoming Shuttle flights to the ISS:

• Fluids  and  Combustion  Facility  (includes  the  Combustion  Integrated  Rack

and the Fluids Integrated Rack)

• Microgravity Science Research Rack
• Space Dynamically Responding Ultrasound Matrix Facility
• Window Observation Research Facility
• EXPRESS Rack 6
• Muscle Atrophy Research Exercise System
• Five  External  Logistics  Carriers  (ELCs)  each  of  which  can  support  two  pay-

loads that do not require a pressurized environment.
• Several International Standard Payload Racks (ISPR)
• Other research facilities can be accommodated on international modules.

The  Alpha  Magnetic  Spectrometer  (AMS),  a  collaboration  between  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy  and  international  participants,  had  been  planned  for  flight  to  the
ISS, but is currently not manifested on any of the remaining Shuttle flights.

Use of ISS to Support Math and Science Education and Competitiveness

In exploring the opportunities for using the ISS National Laboratory for potential
educational  activities,  a  NASA-led  task  force  produced  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion  National  Laboratory  Education  Concept  Development  Report.  The  task  force
concluded  ‘‘that  there  is  significant  interest  among  other  federal  agencies  in  the  op-
portunity to further develop the ISS as an asset for education.’’

In 2007, Congress passed the America COMPETES Act, which became Public Law
110–69.  Section  2006  of  the  law  directs  NASA  to  use  the  results  of  the  ISS  edu-
cation task force report to ‘‘develop a detailed plan for implementation of one or more
education  projects  that  utilize  the  resources  offered  by  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion.’’

In  addition,  Section  2006  directs  NASA  to  ‘‘develop  a  detailed  plan  for  identifica-
tion and support of research to be conducted aboard the International Space Station,
which  offers  the  potential  enhancement  of  United  States  competitiveness  in  science,
technology, and engineering.’’ NASA is to work with agencies and organizations that
have entered into agreements as partners on the ISS National Laboratory.

Establishing ISS Program Service Life

NASA  indicates  that  while  the  FY09  budget  run  out  does  not  presently  allocate
funds for operating ISS beyond 2016, it is not taking any action to preclude it. Like-
wise, out year projections do not include costs to retire and de-commission ISS.

Two new issues have bearing on the ISS’s life expectancy:

1. Reports  of  sooner-than-expected  wear  on  components,  such  as  the  beta  gim-
bal  assembly  (BGA)  and  the  Solar  Array  Rotary  Joint  (SARJ)  could  be  indi-
cations that NASA may need to re-analyze its sparing strategy due to uncer-
tainties about the last two Shuttle logistics flights and resupply options after
the Shuttle is retired in 2010.

2. It was recently reported that Russia will ask partners in June to extend the
utilization  of  the  ISS  until  2020  because  a  Russian  segment  would  take
longer  to  complete.  Russia  still  does  not  have  a  research  module  on  the  ISS
and  the  Multi-Purpose  Laboratory  Module  (MLM)  would  provide  the  ex-
panded  research  capability  desired.  The  MLM  will  be  Russia’s  primary  re-
search  module  as  part  of  the  ISS.  According  to  news  reports,  funding  issues
had  delayed  the  MLM  from  an  initial  2007  date.  A  NASA  official  has  told
Subcommittee  staff  that  NASA  will  discuss  these  issues  at  a  meeting  of  the
partner Space agencies in July of this year.

Chairman UDALL. This hearing will come to order. Good morning
to  all  of  you.  I  want  to  welcome  today’s  witnesses  to  our  hearing.
We welcome your participation and look forward very much to your
testimony.

Today’s  hearing  continues  the  Subcommittee’s  oversight  of
NASA’s  major  programs  by  focusing  on  the  International  Space
Station  (ISS)  Program.  While  it  is  a  program  that  has  had  a  long
and at times controversial and frustrating development path, I am
impressed with the progress that has been made in assembling and
operating  this  incredibly  complex  international  space  science  and
technology  facility.  The  NASA  witness,  Mr.  William  Gerstenmaier,
will  describe  some  of  the  recent  accomplishments  of  the  ISS  Pro-
gram  in  his  testimony,  and  he  and  his  team  and  all  the  inter-
national  partners,  too,  can  take  justifiable  pride  in  what  they  are
achieving.

An  important  component  of  that  success  is  the  way  the  ISS  is
truly  becoming  the  International  Space  Station  with  American,
Japanese, European, Canadian, and Russian astronauts, engineers,
and program managers working together to overcome challenges on
a continuing basis.

Yet,  if  we  are  to  justify  the  significant  resources  that  have  been
expended  on  the  ISS  Program,  we  need  to  be  confident  that  it  is
going  to  be  used  in  as  productive  a  manner  as  possible  once  it  is
assembled.

To that end, I am encouraged by news of emerging research and
commercial collaborations with NASA, and I am looking forward to
hearing  from  our  witnesses  from  the  research  and  commercial  sec-
tors  about  their  plans  for  utilizing  the  Station.  Equally  important,
their  views  on  what  it  will  take  to  make  the  ISS  a  productive
venue for research and commercial activities.

I  also  want  to  hear  NASA  tell  us  what  it  intends  to  do  to  make
the  ISS  a  productive  facility,  not  just  for  research  and  commercial
activities but also to carry out the ISS research and technology ac-
tivities that NASA has said will be necessary to prepare for future
exploration.

In  this  hearing  instead  of  dwelling  on  past  problems,  I  want  to

focus on where we go from here.

However,  as  NASA  talks  about  providing  research  opportunities
on  the  Station,  we  cannot  forget  that  the  funding  cuts  NASA  has
made to its microgravity research programs in recent years, wheth-
er willingly or not, have largely decimated the research community.
Thus, I think the onus has to be on NASA to prove that it means
what  it  says  by  taking  meaningful  steps  both  to  make  the  Station
a productive venue for research and to start to rebuild the research
community.

Yet,  it  won’t  be  possible  to  have  a  productive  Station  unless  the

facility can be sustained after the Shuttle is retired.

I am going to want to hear from NASA about how it plans to en-
sure  the  availability  and  productivity  of  the  ISS  after  the  Shuttle
is  retired,  what  it  considers  the  major  risks  ahead,  and  how  it
plans to manage those risks.

It  is  no  secret  that  we  are  currently  living  with  the  adverse  im-
pacts  of  the  Administration’s  shortsighted  decision  four  years  ago
to accept a four-year gap in U.S. crew launch capabilities after the

Shuttle is retired. I hope we learn from that experience and not let
the  future  of  the  Station  to  be  determined  by  equally  shortsighted
measures.

If  we  are  to  receive  a  meaningful  return  on  the  Nation’s  invest-
ment in the ISS, we need to ensure that the Station’s post-Shuttle
logistics re-supply needs are adequately funded.

It  is  also  clear  that  it  is  time  for  the  Administration  to  commit
to  flying  the  two  contingency  Shuttle  flights  that  will  deliver  crit-
ical spares and logistics to the Station before the Shuttle is retired.
Based  on  all  the  information  provided  to  the  Committee  to  date,
it is clear that those flights are not optional if NASA is to minimize
the risks facing the ISS after 2010.

And  finally,  we  need  to  ensure  that  any  decision  on  the  service
life of this international facility is based on sound policy, consider-
ations,  and  thorough  consultations  with  our  international  partners
and not simply be a date based on the current Administration’s de-
sire  to  make  it  conform  to  their  own  under-funded  budget  plan  for
NASA.

Well,  we  have  a  great  number  of  issues  to  consider  today.  As  I
have  said,  we  have  a  very  good  panel  of  witnesses  to  help  us  ad-
dress them.

Again,  I  want  to  welcome  you,  and  we  will  look  forward  to  your

testimony.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Udall follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MARK UDALL

Good  morning.  I’d  like  to  welcome  our  witnesses  to  today’s  hearing.  We  welcome

your participation and look forward to your testimony.

Today’s  hearing  continues  the  Subcommittee’s  oversight  of  NASA’s  major  pro-

grams by focusing on the International Space Station program.

While  it  is  a  program  that  has  had  a  long,  and  at  times  controversial  and  frus-
trating  development  path,  I  am  impressed  with  the  progress  that  has  been  made
in  assembling  and  operating  this  incredibly  complex  international  space-based
science and technology facility.

The  NASA  witness,  Mr.  William  Gerstenmaier,  will  describe  some  of  the  recent
accomplishments  of  the  ISS  program  in  his  testimony,  and  he  and  his  team—and
all  of  the  international  partners  too—can  take  justifiable  pride  in  what  they  are
achieving.

An important component of that success is the way that the ISS is truly becoming
the International Space Station, with American, Japanese, European, Canadian, and
Russian  astronauts,  engineers,  and  program  managers  working  together  to  over-
come challenges on a continuing basis.

Yet, if we are to justify the significant resources that have been expended on the
ISS  program,  we  need  to  be  confident  that  it  is  going  to  be  used  in  as  productive
a manner as possible once it is assembled.

To  that  end,  I  am  encouraged  by  news  of  emerging  research  and  commercial  col-
laborations  with  NASA,  and  I  am  looking  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses
from  the  research  and  commercial  sectors  about  their  plans  for  utilizing  the  Sta-
tion. . .

And equally importantly, their views on what it will take to make the ISS a pro-

ductive venue for research and commercial activities.

I also want to hear NASA tell us what it intends to do to make the ISS a produc-
tive  facility—not  just  for  research  and  commercial  activities,  but  also  to  carry  out
the  ISS  research  and  technology  activities  that  NASA  has  said  will  be  needed  to
prepare for future exploration.

In  this  hearing,  instead  of  dwelling  on  past  problems,  I  want  to  focus  on  where

we go from here.

However,  as  NASA  talks  about  providing  research  opportunities  on  the  ISS,  we
cannot  forget  that  the  funding  cuts  NASA  has  made  to  its  microgravity  research
programs in recent years—whether willingly or not—have largely decimated that re-
search community.

Thus,  I  think  the  onus  has  to  be  on  NASA  to  prove  that  it  means  what  it  says
by  taking  meaningful  steps  both  to  make  the  ISS  a  productive  venue  for  research
and to start to rebuild that research community.

Yet,  it  won’t  be  possible  to  have  a  productive  ISS  unless  the  facility  can  be  sus-

tained after the Shuttle is retired.

I am going to want to hear from NASA about how it plans to ensure the viability
and productivity of the ISS after the Shuttle is retired, what it considers the major
risks ahead, and how it plans to manage those risks.

It is no secret that we are currently living with the adverse impacts of the Admin-
istration’s  shortsighted  decision  four  years  ago  to  accept  a  four-year  gap  in  U.S.
crew launch capabilities after the Shuttle is retired.

I  hope  we  learn  from  that  experience  and  not  let  the  future  of  the  ISS  be  deter-

mined by equally shortsighted measures.

If  we  are  to  realize  a  meaningful  return  on  the  Nation’s  investment  in  the  ISS,
we  need  to  ensure  that  the  ISS’s  post-Shuttle  logistics  resupply  needs  are  ade-
quately funded.

It  is  also  clear  that  it  is  time  for  the  Administration  to  commit  to  flying  the  two
‘‘contingency’’ Shuttle flights that will deliver critical spares and logistics to the Sta-
tion before the Shuttle is retired.

Based on all of the information provided to the Committee to date, it is clear those
flights  are  not  optional  if  NASA  is  to  minimize  the  risks  facing  the  ISS  after  2010.
And  finally,  we  need  to  ensure  that  any  decision  on  the  service  life  of  this  inter-
national facility is based on sound policy considerations and thorough consultations
with our international partners—and not simply be a date based on the current Ad-
ministration’s  desire  to  make  it  conform  to  their  own  underfunded  budget  plan  for
NASA.

Well,  we  have  a  great  number  of  issues  to  consider  today,  and  we  have  a  very

good panel of witnesses to help us address them.

I again want to welcome them, and we look forward to your testimony.
Chairman  UDALL.  The  Chair  now  is  greatly  privileged  to  recog-
nize  my  good  friend,  Congressman  Hall,  for  an  opening  statement.
Mr. HALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you, again, for my
first  neighbor  when  I  came  up  here  28  years  ago  with  Mr.  Udall.
I  learned  more  from  him  than  I  had  the  past  50  years  politically.
And  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  calling  this  morning’s  very
timely hearing on the International Space Station.

I want to begin by thanking the witnesses, because I know about
your busy schedules, and I know a lot of you have traveled consid-
erable  distance,  and  I  want  to  assure  all  of  you  that  your  wisdom
and  expertise  are  greatly  valued  by,  I  value  them  greatly,  as  do
other  Members  of  this  committee,  because  we,  you  are  knowledge-
able about what we are discussing, and we write laws based on the
good  information  that  we  get  from  good  folks  like  you  that  give  us
your time.

And I would ask you, Mr. Pickens, are you related to Boone Pick-
ens? He is one of the finest guys in the whole world. He just abso-
lutely  leads  the  energy  chase  and  is  generous  with  universities.
Golly,  he  is  going  to  solicit  Nature’s  Aid  in  the  greatest  way.  He
is really a great guy, and I am—and how is he related to you?

Mr. PICKENS. He is my father.
Mr. HALL. Your father? Golly, I wish he was my father.
Anyway,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  International  Space  Station  is  well
on  its  way  to  completion,  and  if  NASA  successfully  flies  out  its  re-
maining schedule of flights over the next two years, it will be capa-
ble of conducting a wide array of world-class science.

The  United  States  and  its  international  partners  have  invested
tens of billions of dollars to assemble the most complex and largest
laboratory and living facility ever to fly in space. The fruits of this
investment are only now capable of really being realized.

23

But  having  said  that,  a  number  of  critical  questions  and  chal-
lenges  remain  to  be  answered,  both  with  respect  to  completing  as-
sembly  of  Station  and  once  accomplished,  using  the  Station  as  a
one-of-a-kind laboratory to conduct research in a microgravity envi-
ronment.

Issues  that  bear  discussion  include  the  status  of  the  two  contin-
gency  flights.  Is  NASA  committed  to  flying  them  or  not?  Will  the
United  States  be  able  to  reliably  and  safely  move  crew  and  cargo
to and from Station during the five-year gap between retirement of
Shuttle and advent of the Orion Ares Launch System?

Now,  and  how  safe  is  Soyuz  in  light  of  the  most  recent  pair  of
re-entries that did not perform as expected? I hope our NASA wit-
nesses, Mr. Gerstenmaier, will be able to spend a couple of minutes
in  his  opening  testimony  talking  about  Soyuz  performance  prob-
lems and potential solutions.

I am also concerned about NASA’s plans to fully exploit the Sta-
tion’s research and testing capabilities and how it intends to maxi-
mize its utility as a national research laboratory.

Several  of  the  witnesses  will  offer  helpful  insights  and  sugges-
tions  stemming  from  their  experiences.  By  raising  these  questions
I  don’t  mean  to  appear  critical  of  NASA’s  management  of  ISS.  In
fact,  I  would  applaud  Mr.  Gerstenmaier  and  the  men  and  women
of  NASA  and  their  contractor  teams  for  making  the  difficult  task
of  building  the  Station  look  relatively  routine.  I  can  only  imagine
the  amount  of  detailed  planning,  design,  and  consultation,  as  well
as  negotiating  with  our  international  partners  that  went  into  this
effort.

It  has  always  been  one  of  NASA’s  great  strengths  and  perhaps
one  of  its  biggest  public  relations  challenges  to  make  the  highly-
dangerous and complex task of space flight look benign, easy, or of
no significance.

I want to again thank our witnesses for joining us this morning,

and I certainly look forward to your testimony.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this morning’s timely hearing on the status
of  the  International  Space  Station.  I  want  to  begin  by  thanking  our  witnesses  for
taking  time  out  of  their  busy  schedules  to  be  here.  Some  of  you  have  traveled  con-
siderable  distance,  and  I  want  to  assure  all  of  you  that  your  wisdom  and  expertise
are greatly valued by me and other Members of the Committee.

Mr.  Chairman,  the  International  Space  Station  is  well  on  its  way  to  completion
and,  if  NASA  successfully  flies  out  its  remaining  schedule  of  flights  over  the  next
two  years,  it  will  be  capable  of  conducting  a  wide  array  of  world  class  science.  The

to spend a couple of minutes in his opening testimony talking about Soyuz perform-
ance problems and potential solutions.

I am also concerned about NASA’s plans to fully exploit the station’s research and
testing  capabilities,  and  how  it  intends  to  maximize  its  utility  as  a  National  Re-
search  Laboratory.  Several  of  our  witnesses  will  offer  helpful  insights  and  sugges-
tions stemming from their experiences.

By raising these questions, I don’t mean to appear critical of NASA’s management
of  ISS.  In  fact,  I  want  to  applaud  Mr.  Gerstenmaier  and  the  men  and  women  of
NASA, and their contractor teams, for making the difficult task of building the sta-
tion look relatively routine. I can only imagine the amount of detailed planning, de-
sign,  and  consultation,  as  well  as  negotiating  with  our  international  partners,  that
went into this effort. It has always been one of NASA’s greatest strengths, and per-
haps  one  of  its  biggest  public  relations  challenges,  to  make  the  highly  dangerous
and complex task of space flight look benign.

I  want  to  again  thank  our  witnesses  for  joining  us  this  morning,  and  I  look  for-

ward to hearing their testimony. Thank you.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall.  If  there  are  Members
who  wish  to  submit  additional  opening  statements,  your  state-
ments  will  be  added  to  the  record.  Without  objection,  so  ordered.
At this time I would like to introduce our first panel of witnesses.
I  am  going  to  start  from  my  left,  and  we  will  introduce  each  one
of you, and then we will return and start with the panel.

Dr.  Edward  Knipling  is  the  Administrator  for  the  Agricultural
Research  Service  at  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture.  Next  to
him, Dr. Louis Stodieck, who is a constituent of mine. He is the Di-
rector of the BioServe Space Technologies at the University of Colo-
rado  at  Boulder.  To  his  left,  Dr.  Cheryl  Nickerson  is  an  Associate
Professor  at  the  Biodesign  Institute  in  the  Center  for  Infectious
Diseases and Vaccinology at Arizona State University. I would note
I  grew  up  in  Tucson  so  I  tend  to  be  a  little  bit  more  of  a  fan  of
the  University  of  Arizona,  but  we  will  leave  that  where  it  may  be,
Dr.  Nickerson.  And  finally  we  have  Mr.  Thomas  Pickens,  III,  who
is  the  President  and  CEO  of  SPACEHAB,  Incorporated,  and  who
shares  kinship  now  with  Dr.  Hall  because  you  both  have  a  father
in  common.  You  have,  Dr.  Hall  is  an  honorable,  he  is  everybody’s
father, including mine.

I would add before we turn back to the witnesses, it is an honor
for me. I don’t know that I have had a chance to Chair a committee
hearing  in  the  presence  of  Judge  Hall,  but  he  has  been  a  mentor
to me, and he chaired this committee, and I am truly honored.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to also note that
it is an honor for me to be here with a man who knew Sam Hous-
ton as well.

Chairman  UDALL.  We  will  discuss  later  whether  that  com-
mentary will be in the record or not based on Judge Hall’s perspec-
tive.

And  again,  the  witnesses  know  that  spoken  testimony  is  limited
to  five  minutes  each,  after  which  Members  of  the  Subcommittee
will have five minutes each to ask questions.

Dr. Knipling, the floor is yours.

Panel 1:

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  EDWARD  B.  KNIPLING,  ADMINISTRATOR,
AGRICULTURAL  RESEARCH  SERVICE,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF
AGRICULTURE
Dr.  KNIPLING.  Well,  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  Members  of
the  Subcommittee.  My  name  is  Edward  Knipling.  I  serve  as  the
Administrator  of  the  Agriculture  Research  Service,  also  known  as
ARS.  ARS  is  the  research  arm  of  USDA,  the  intramural,  in-house
research  arm  of  USDA,  and  we  operate  a  network  of  100  federal
agricultural science laboratories across the Nation in all aspects of
agricultural science.

And  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  this  sub-
committee  today  to  present  testimony  about  ARS’s  collaboration
with NASA on research relevant to agriculture and the Space Pro-
gram.

ARS  and  NASA  have  a  long  history  of  working  together.  The
ARS  Beltsville  Agricultural  Research  Center  and  the  Goddard
Space  Flight  Center  in  Maryland,  we  are  next-door  neighbors.  We
worked  together  for  many  years,  particularly  with  respect  to  the
Earth  Observation  Program  and  various  aspects  of  remote  sensing
of the environment.

Among  our  successes  in  that  area  are  predictions  of  animal  dis-
ease outbreaks in Africa based upon global weather and vegetation
patterns  that  affect  insect  vector  populations,  detection  of  drought
indicators,  remote  measurements  of  crop  yields,  detection  and  risk
assessment of plant pests and invasive species, and development of
data for application of precision farming using GPS technology. The
role  of  ARS  scientists  in  these  collaborations  has  been  to  provide
the  knowledge  and  interpretation  of  plant,  animal,  and  environ-
mental indicators recorded in the imagery and other data collected
by NASA’s satellites and other aerial platform sensors, and in turn,
how to effectively design and use those systems for meaningful en-
vironmental and biological assessments.

These  research  activities  have  been  conducted  under  the  frame-
work of an existing Memorandum of Understanding between USDA
and  NASA  and  various  predecessor  agreements,  and  today  I  will
speak  of  a  planned  new  Memorandum  of  Understanding  involving
research collaboration in the agricultural life sciences that will take
advantage  of  the  microgravity  environment  of  the  International
Space Station.

And Mr. Chairman, I will address four questions about this new
collaboration  between  ARS  and  NASA  that  are  of  particular  inter-
est  to  this  subcommittee.  One  of  these  is  what  achievements  are
expected under this new collaboration? Well, we anticipate this re-
search will lead to new understandings of biological cellular mecha-
nisms and creative new ways to improve American agriculture, pro-
tect  the  environment,  and  contribute  to  human  health.  These  will
be  based  upon  principles  related  to  the  early  development  of  cells
and how that development is influenced by zero or reduced gravity
compared to the Earth’s gravitational field.

Certainly  access  to  the  facilities  and  the  environment  of  the
International  Space  Station  will  provide  ARS  with  new  abilities  to
test biological processes in microgravity. Topics of immediate inter-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

26

est  are  development  plant  and  animal  cells  and  culture  and  im-
proved  understanding  of  the  capacity  of  such  cells  to  express  de-
sired traits or to develop in specialized ways. Selection of cell lines
under  microgravity  may  provide  germplasm  capable  of  improving
plant resistance to pathogens, improved growth characteristics, and
generation of functional replacement organs.

Question number two. How will ARS and NASA proceed on these
collaborations?  Our  ARS  program  managers  and  scientists  have
met  with  NASA  program  managers  and  scientists  to  define  areas
of  mutual  interest.  They  have  determined  that  for  work  on  the
International  Space  Station,  the  ARS  focus  will  be  on  the  science
of  cells,  principally  the  affects  of  microgravity  on  basic  biological
mechanisms,  genetic  regulation  in  plants  and  animal  cells,  patho-
genesis  in  both  plants  and  animal  cells,  development  of  cells  cul-
tured to understand organ function and development, and selection
of plant cells for desirable growth characteristics.

We  expect  to  apply  the  findings  and  results  of  research  in  these
areas  to  improving  animal  and  plant  productivity.  We  anticipate
that our first collaborative research on the Space Station will be to
understand  the  effect  of  microgravity  on  the  differentiation  of  ani-
mal  germ  cells.  Our  goal  is  to  develop  and  validate  the  technology
to produce and replicate undifferentiated cells that can be, in turn,
used  to  study  gene  expression,  cellular  differentiation,  and  to  im-
prove genetic enhancement technologies.

What  is  the  role  of  agriculture  in  space  research?  Well,  we  envi-
sion the tools of space research provided by NASA collaboration as
a  powerful  means  to  better  understand  and  deal  with  the  respon-
sibilities and challenges we face in agriculture as well as exploiting
new opportunities to help advance to agricultural life scientists and
potential  new  applications.  And  certainly  our  experiences  with  the
development  of  remote  sensing  applications  have  proven  this  to  be
possible.

The ARS research mission and our own goals themselves will not
change,  but  we  will  benefit  from  the  NASA  collaboration  and
unique  approaches  to  help  reach  our  goals.  The  new  MOU  that  I
spoke  about  will  specify  that  each  agency,  ARS  and  NASA,  will,
shall  provide  their  own  resources,  including  expenditure  of  funds,
to  support  their,  our  respective  complementary  part  of  the  collabo-
rative research.

Question  four.  How  will  ARS  develop  a  research  plan  for  work
on  the  International  Space  Station?  Well,  planning  for  this  work
has already begun at the national or program level. Our respective
program  managers  have  worked  together  to  assure  that  the  goals
to be met will be relevant to the problems of agriculture and to es-
tablish a formal relationship through the MOU. And at the investi-
gator level, science level, NASA, ARS, and cooperating private sec-
tor and university scientists have met and explored the possibilities
for specific experiments to be conducted.

Initially  ARS  investigators  are  interested  in  determining  if  fer-
tilized  cow  eggs  do  not  differentiate  under  microgravity  but  con-
tinue  to  replicate.  And  additional  experiments  will  be  designed  for
a  particular  set  of  cell  lines  from  swine  embryos  that  have  been
shown to give rise to liver cells, and these cells may have potential
use in artificial liver devices.

27

Many  questions  about  the  regulation  of  their  differentiation  and
replication  in  culture  remain  unanswered.  And  the  research  plan-
ning has focused on the design of experiments to answer such ques-
tions.

In  addition  to  the  potential  value  of  all  of  these  experiments  for
advancing animal and plant agriculture, they are expected to serve
as models for beneficial applications of cell culture technologies for
human health as well.

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, this completes
my  testimony.  I  will  be  pleased  to  address  any  questions  that  you
have at a later time.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Knipling follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF EDWARD B. KNIPLING

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I am Edward B. Knipling, Ad-
ministrator  of  the  Agricultural  Research  Service  (ARS).  ARS  is  the  principal  intra-
mural  science  research  agency  of  the  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture
(USDA).  ARS  operates  a  network  of  more  than  100  federal  research  laboratories
across the Nation on all aspects of agricultural science.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Subcommittee  today  to
present  testimony  about  ARS’  collaboration  with  the  National  Aeronautics  and
Space Administration (NASA) on research relevant to agriculture and the space pro-
gram.

ARS and NASA have a long history of working together. The ARS Beltsville Agri-
cultural Research Center and the Goddard Space Flight Center are next-door neigh-
bors in Maryland. ARS scientists at Beltsville and other ARS locations have worked
with  the  NASA  scientists  in  the  Earth  Observation  program  at  Goddard  and  else-
where to apply a wide range of remote sensing methods to environmental and agri-
cultural problems.

Among  our  successes  are  predictions  of  animal  disease  (Rift  Valley  Fever)  out-
breaks  based  on  global  weather  patterns,  detection  of  drought  indicators,  remote
measurement  of  crop  yields,  detection  and  risk  assessment  of  plant  pests  and
invasive  species,  and  development  of  data  for  application  of  precision  farming.  The
roles  of  ARS  scientists  in  such  collaborations  have  been  to  provide  knowledge  and
interpretation  of  plant,  animal,  and  environmental  indicators  recorded  in  the  im-
agery  and  data  collected  by  NASA’s  satellite  and  other  aerial  platform  sensors,  as
well  as  how  to  effectively  design  and  use  these  systems  for  meaningful  environ-
mental and biological assessments.

These research activities have been conducted under the framework of an existing
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and predecessor agreements between USDA
and  NASA.  Today  I  will  speak  of  a  planned  new  Memorandum  of  Understanding
involving  research  collaborations  in  the  agricultural  life  sciences  that  will  take  ad-
vantage  of  the  microgravity  environment  of  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS).
Mr. Chairman, I will address four issues about this new collaboration between ARS
and NASA that are of particular interest to this subcommittee.

Achievements Expected Under the New Collaboration

We anticipate that this research will lead to new understandings of biological cel-
lular  mechanisms  and  creative  new  ways  to  improve  American  agriculture,  protect
the environment, and contribute to human health. These will be based on principles
related  to  the  early  development  of  cells  and  how  that  development  is  influenced
by zero or reduced gravity compared to the earth’s gravity environment.

Access  to  the  facilities  and  environment  of  the  ISS  will  provide  ARS  with  new
abilities to test biological processes in microgravity. Topics of immediate interest are
development of plant and animal cells in culture and improved understanding of the
capacity of such cells to express desired traits or to develop in specialized ways. Se-
lection of cell lines under microgravity may provide germplasm capable of improving
plant  resistance  to  pathogens,  improved  growth  characteristics,  and  generation  of
functional replacement organs.

How ARS and NASA Will Proceed on Significant Collaborations

ARS  program  managers  and  scientists  have  met  with  NASA  program  managers
and scientists to define the areas of mutual interest. They have determined that for

work on the ISS the ARS focus will be on the science of cells, principally the effects
of microgravity on:

Æ basic biological mechanisms,
Æ genetic regulation in plants and animals cells,
Æ pathogenesis in both plants and animal cells,
Æ development of cells cultured to understand organ function and development,

and

Æ selection of plant cells for desirable growth characteristics.

We expect to apply the findings and results of research in these areas to improv-
ing  animal  and  plant  productivity.  We  anticipate  that  our  first  collaborative  re-
search on the ISS will be to understand the effect of microgravity on the differentia-
tion  of  animal  germ  cells.  Our  goal  is  to  be  able  to  produce  undifferentiated  cells
that  can  be  used  to  study  gene  expression,  cellular  differentiation,  and  to  improve
genetic enhancement technologies.

The Role of Agriculture in Space Research

We envision the tools of space research provided by NASA collaboration as a pow-
erful  means  to  better  understand  and  deal  with  the  responsibilities  and  challenges
we face in agriculture as well as exploiting new opportunities. Our experiences with
the development of remote sensing applications have proven this to be true. We ex-
pect  that  the  microgravity  environment  on  the  ISS  will  provide  the  same  kinds  of
benefits  to  help  advance  our  agricultural  life  sciences  programs  and  potential  new
applications.  The  ARS  research  mission  and  goals  will  not  change  but  we  will  ben-
efit from NASA collaboration and unique approaches to help reach those goals. The
new  MOU  will  specify  that  each  agency,  ARS  and  NASA,  shall  provide  their  own
resources, including expenditure of funding, to support their respective complemen-
tary part of the collaborative research.

How ARS Will Develop a Research Plan for Work on the ISS

Planning  for  this  research  on  the  ISS  has  begun.  ARS  has  been  involved  at  two
levels:  at  the  national  planning  level  and  at  the  investigator  level.  At  the  national
level, ARS program managers have worked with NASA program managers to assure
that the goals to be met would be relevant to problems of agriculture and to estab-
lish a formal relationship through a MOU. At the investigator level, NASA and ARS
scientists have met and explored the possibilities for specific experiments to be con-
ducted  at  the  ISS.  In  particular  ARS  investigators  are  interested  the  development
and  differentiation  of  a  particular  set  of  cell  lines  that  came  from  swine  embryos
and  have  been  shown  to  give  rise  to  liver  cells.  These  cells  may  even  be  able  to  be
used in artificial liver devices. Many questions about the regulation of their differen-
tiation in culture remain unanswered. Research planning has focused on the design
of  experiment  to  ask  questions  about  the  role  of  gravity  in  cell  culture  differentia-
tion.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  completes  my  testimony.  I  will  be  pleased  to  address  any

questions you and Subcommittee Members may have.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Dr. Knipling.

Dr.  STODIECK.  Chairman  Udall  and  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  before  you  today.
The  International  Space  Station  represents  an  incredible  human
achievement  for  which  our  nation  and  our  international  partners
can  be  very  proud.  It  represents  the  best  of  what  people  can  do
working  together  with  commitment  and  resolve.  I  for  one  am  very
grateful  to  the  engineers  and  all  who  have  built  this  magnificent
facility.

With the focus on assembly of the ISS set to end in only two and
one-half years, research utilization, the original purpose of the ISS,
can finally be brought to the forefront of our discussions and plan-
ning. The ISS has tremendous potential to advance our nation’s in-
terests in science, technology, and commerce. I imagine some of the
witnesses here today will testify to this potential, and you will find
other illustrations of this in my written statement.

These  examples  are  but  the  tip  of  the  proverbial  iceberg.  The
ability  to  use  the  lens  of  microgravity  to  understand  and  exploit
gravity  as  a  physical  force  is  unique  to  the  ISS.  If  fully  utilized,  I
expect that the ISS is going to greatly advance scientific knowledge
and have important economic impacts in many fields of study.

The  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005,  designated  the  U.S.  seg-
ment  of  the  ISS  as  a  national  laboratory.  This  designation  was  a
result  of  Congress  recognizing  that  limiting  ISS  utilization  to  only
NASA’s  exploration  research  needs  would  do  a  disservice  to  the
taxpaying  public  and  the  many  ISS  stakeholders.  This  designation
clearly  opens  the  door  to  re-establishing  the  ISS  as  an  important,
productive R&D facility.

However, this step by itself is insufficient to insure that the ISS
National Lab will be successful. In my view there are three actions
that need to be taken.

The  first  is  Congress  or  NASA  should  establish  an  independent
management organization to provide leadership of the ISS National
Lab  R&D  activities.  This  organization  should  be  chartered  to  de-
velop  and  manage  a  rich  portfolio  of  non-exploration  research  on
the ISS. The expeditious way to do this might be for NASA to iden-
tify  one  or  more  qualified  organizations  to  provide  this  leadership
and  form  a  partnership  with  them  through  the  use  of  a  space  act
agreement.

Resulting  ISS  National  Lab  management  organization  would
reach out to scientists and commercial users across disciplines and
across  institutions,  identify  the  best  research  ideas  to  bring  for-
ward.  The  organization  would  also  serve  as  the  interface  to  NASA
and  assure,  and  assume  the  responsibility  for  getting  the  research
integrated and operated on the ISS.

The  second  action  that  should  be  taken  is  Congress  should  pro-
vide modest funding to encourage and support non-NASA agencies,
U.S.  industry,  universities,  and  other  organizations  to  utilize  the
ISS.  Under  the  ISS  National  Lab  model,  the  research  sponsor
would  be  expected  to  cover  the  cost  of  the  science.  And  it  should.
However,  conducting  research  on  the  ISS  requires  something  like
five  to  ten  times  the  funding  than  that  needed  for  comparable
ground-based research. This is because research on the ISS carries
additional costs associated with all the requirements to fly with the
procurement  of  specialized  hardware  and  with  securing  transpor-
tation to and from low-Earth orbit.

If  ISS  National  Lab  users  are  required  to  cover  these  full  costs,
then I fear it will have the unfortunate affect of precluding a num-
ber  of  excellent  ideas  from  going  forward.  Funding  provided  to  the
ISS  National  Lab  management  organization  to  cover  these  extra
costs  would  encourage  increased  demand  for  ISS  utilization  and
help achieve a high level of productivity and ultimately success.

30

The third action is for Congress or NASA to ensure that research
sponsors  have  regular,  reliable,  and  frequent  transportation  access
to  and  from  the  ISS.  The  Space  Shuttle  is  currently  the  only  vehi-
cle with any significant capacity for bringing research samples and
equipment back to Earth. Retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2010,
will exactly coincide with when this capability will be most needed
for the ISS National Lab to become productive.

The  best  option  for  both  up  and  down  transportation  will  be  for
one  or  more  U.S.  commercial  providers  to  be  successful  at  devel-
oping new launch vehicles and ISS docking spacecraft and for these
capabilities  to  be  pressed  into  service.  As  NASA  works  to  procure
services  for  logistics  re-supply  to  the  ISS,  planning  should  also  in-
clude the needs of the ISS National Lab users. Productive ISS Na-
tional Lab will require something like 20 to 25 percent of the trans-
portation capacity both up and down with shipments spread across
multiple flights each year.

The ISS National Lab has enormous potential to advance the in-
terests  of  the  Nation  in  commerce,  science,  medicine,  technology,
and education. If the steps I have just outlined are taken, I believe
ISS National Lab will be productive, and significant breakthroughs
can be expected.

Thank  you  for  your  time,  and  I  look  forward  to  answering  any

questions you may have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LOUIS S. STODIECK

Chairman  Udall,  Ranking  Member  Feeney  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,
thank you for inviting me to testify on a subject that I feel is very important to our
nation. As you will see, I believe there is tremendous potential for the International
Space Station (ISS), as a National Laboratory, to be utilized for high-value research
and development in low-Earth orbit. I also hope to convince you that more must be
done now to position the ISS National Laboratory to succeed.

My  name  is  Louis  Stodieck  and  I  am  a  Research  Professor  in  the  department  of
Aerospace  Engineering  Sciences  at  the  University  of  Colorado  at  Boulder.  In  addi-
tion  to  my  academic  role  at  CU–Boulder,  I  am  privileged  to  serve  as  the  Director
of  BioServe  Space  Technologies,  a  space  life  sciences  research  center.  BioServe  was
founded  in  November  1987  through  a  NASA  grant  to  the  University.  Through  its
20-year history, BioServe’s mission has essentially remained unchanged: we work in
partnership  with  industry,  academia  and  government  to  conduct  space  life  sciences
research  that  primarily  focuses  on  commercial  applications  that  could  benefit  the
public. BioServe has served the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, agribusiness and bio-
medical industry sectors with most Center projects focusing on the effects of micro-
gravity, often referred to as weightlessness.

Starting with our first flight in 1991 on STS–37, the Center has flown 40 payloads
on 29 missions. Our experiments have launched on the Space Shuttle, Progress and
Soyuz  vehicles  and  were  operated  in  orbit  on  the  Space  Shuttle,  the  Russian  Mir
Space  Station  and,  more  recently,  the  International  Space  Station.  A  wide  range  of
experiments have been carried out across the full spectrum of space life sciences ap-
plications  that  have  evaluated  molecular  processes,  cell  and  tissue  biology  and  the
development and adaptation of various plants and organisms. BioServe’s commercial
partners have included large Fortune 500 companies such as Amgen, Bristol-Myers
Squibb,  Procter  and  Gamble  and  Weyerhaeuser  along  with  numerous  start-up  and
established smaller life sciences companies.

It is through the above activities that I feel I am qualified to present to you today
the reasons why the Nation should capitalize on the ISS and utilize its capabilities
to the greatest possible extent.

Potential for R&D on the International Space Station

The  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  represents  an  incredible  human  achieve-
ment  for  which  our  nation  and  our  International  Partners  can  be  very  proud.  The
launch  of  the  first  ISS  element  took  place  just  under  10  years  ago  in  1998.  Today,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

the  ISS  is  a  remarkable  orbiting  laboratory  with  unequaled  capabilities.  It  rep-
resents  the  culmination  of  the  dedication  and  commitment  of  thousands  of  people
who  have  worked  tirelessly  on  the  design,  fabrication  and  on-orbit  assembly  of  this
massive  undertaking.  The  ISS  also  represents  an  unparalleled  opportunity  in
human  history:  The  ability  to  use  the  ‘‘lens’’  of  microgravity  to  understand  and  ex-
ploit  gravity  as  a  physical  force.  The  ISS  offers  a  superb  vantage  point  from  which
to  observe  the  Earth  as  well  as  providing  access  to  the  space  environment,  at-
tributes that can both be exploited for research. The ISS is rapidly growing in capa-
bility and even now can support a wide array of research and development activities
that simply cannot be done on Earth.

During  the  last  10  years,  the  focus  for  the  ISS  Program  has  necessarily  been  on
assembly.  NASA’s  ISS  Payload’s  Office  at  the  Johnson  Space  Center  has  done  an
excellent  job  of  supporting  research  utilization,  but  in  reality  such  utilization  has
had  to  take  a  back  seat  to  ISS  assembly  and  maintenance.  The  focus  on  assembly
has  meant  that  comparatively  little  transportation  volume,  mass,  power  and,  prob-
ably most important of all—crew time—have been available to utilize the ISS to any
significant  extent.  As  a  result,  many  of  the  ISS  racks  and  equipment  are  currently
sitting  idle  awaiting  the  day  when  ISS  utilization  can  be  ramped  up.  So,  when  can
ISS utilization be ramped up, and what will it take to do so?

Based on the current schedule, the ISS project is now only two and one-half years
away  from  completion.  At  that  point,  the  ISS  can  be  officially  and  substantially
opened  for  business.  A  significant  part  of  that  business,  in  my  mind,  ought  to  be
scientific  and  commercial  research  and  development.  It  will  indeed  be  unfortunate
if  the  ISS  remains  substantially  under-utilized  once  it  is  completed  in  2010.  I  hope
instead  that  with  proper  planning  and  strategic  investment  now,  the  ISS  will  be
able  to  live  up  to  its  fullest  potential  as  a  unique  laboratory  the  like  of  which  has
never  before  been  available  and  possibly  never  again  will  be  in  our  lifetime.  It  is
probably not possible to predict when the ISS will reach the end of its lifetime and
be  de-commissioned,  and  it  seems  quite  premature  to  discuss  this  when  the  lab  is
not  yet  completed  and  anything  close  to  full  utilization  remains  unrealized.  How-
ever,  the  operational  lifetime  of  the  ISS  is  currently  certified  only  through  2016.
Even  if  this  date  is  extended,  it  should  be  clear  to  all  of  us  that  the  ISS  will  be
available  to  serve  the  interests  of  the  U.S.,  our  International  Partners  and,  more
broadly, humanity for a finite period of time. Once the Space Shuttle is retired, our
ability  to  service  and  replace  major  components  of  the  ISS  will  be  severely  con-
strained.  This  ultimately  could  limit  or  reduce  the  amount  of  science  that  is  con-
ducted in this laboratory. Compare this situation with that of the Hubble Space Tel-
escope.  Just  imagine  how  the  lifetime  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  would  have
been shortened and consider the amount of science lost without Space Shuttle serv-
icing  missions.  The  period  of  actual  use  of  the  ISS  after  assembly  complete  may  be
only  five  to  10  years  and  may  be  determined  more  by  an  inability  to  maintain  safe
operations  than  by  U.S.  policy.  Thus,  it  will  be  very  important  to  derive  the  most
benefits  possible  from  this  incredible,  one-of-a-kind  laboratory  as  early  as  possible
and for as long as possible.

Currently, NASA remains the predominant user of the ISS. Research is being per-
formed to better understand the negative effects of long-duration space flight on the
human  body  and  to  develop  countermeasures  and  technologies  to  mitigate  these  ef-
fects.  Non-exploration  utilization  research  on  the  ISS  has  been  conducted  but  only
on a limited basis due to resource constraints and NASA’s focus on the Exploration
Vision.  If  the  ISS  is  going  to  live  up  to  its  full  potential,  then  clearly  the  produc-
tivity  of  the  station  must  significantly  increase,  especially  for  non-exploration  re-
search.

Before  discussing  the  future  of  ISS  utilization,  I  believe  it  is  important  to  revisit
the  potential  that  ISS  represents  and  why  planning  and  further  investment  should
be considered to jump start the great body of work to be done there.

Value of ISS as a National Lab

It is easiest for me to speak from the experience and flight research projects that
my  Center  has  directly  sponsored  or  supported.  Of  course  there  are  numerous  arti-
cles  and  studies  that  have  identified  and  vetted  the  best  R&D  applications  for  the
ISS  across  a  host  of  scientific  disciplines.  The  examples  below  are  based  in  the  life
sciences, which is the focus of our Center and my area of expertise.

Despite significant funding challenges over the last few years following the termi-
nation  of  NASA’s  Space  Product  Development  program,  the  program  within  NASA
under  which  BioServe  was  funded,  BioServe  has  strived  to  remain  productive  in
space flight research endeavors. We have done so for the simple reason that we be-
lieve  strongly  in  the  potential  of  the  ISS  to  benefit  the  general  public,  commerce,
scientific  knowledge,  technology  development  and  education.  Since  December  of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

32

2006,  space  flight  hardware  designed  and  developed  by  BioServe  has  supported  17
different  commercial,  international,  NASA  and  K–12  research  projects.  These  re-
search  experiments  have  flown  on  five  different  Shuttle  missions,  launched  and
landed on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, and spanned three ISS increments. In addi-
tion, BioServe has had operating research hardware on-board the ISS since Decem-
ber of 2002.

Over the years BioServe has worked with several different commercial companies
in  support  of  collaborative  research  with  commercial  applications.  Some  of  these
companies are mentioned above but the most recent support of commercial research
involved experiments conducted in collaboration with Amgen and SPACEHAB.

Amgen, one of the world’s largest biotechnology companies, has collaborated with
BioServe  in  the  area  of  disuse  bone  and  muscle  loss  since  1995.  During  this  time
BioServe  conducted  ground-  and  space-based  studies  both  to  verify  the  models  uti-
lized in these studies as well as to determine the effectiveness of two Amgen devel-
oped  investigational  compounds  designed  to  reduce  or  prevent  significant  bone  and
muscle loss associated with certain types of disease and disuse conditions. This work
culminated in two successful space flight experiments, one conducted on-board STS–
108  and  the  other  on-board  STS–118.  For  each  experiment,  in  addition  to  the  pri-
mary  research  that  was  conducted,  Amgen  agreed  BioServe  could  arrange  a  tissue-
sharing  program  in  which  unused  tissues  from  the  space  experiments  were  given
to  over  20  separate  investigators  each  researching  the  effects  of  space  flight  and
microgravity  exposure  on  different  physiological  systems.  In  essence  with  careful
planning  productivity  was  greatly  enhanced  despite  limited  resources.  Although
these two space flight experiments were Shuttle missions, it is believed that signifi-
cant  additional  information  could  be  learned  through  longer  duration  studies  on-
board ISS.

The  research  projects  with  Amgen  show  the  potential  for  alignment  between  in-
dustry  and  NASA  goals  and  needs  in  the  broader  context  of  the  ISS  National  Lab.
For example, the research investigation of a bone therapeutic on STS–108 was part
of  a  much  larger  traditional  development  program  being  conducted  by  Amgen.
Today, that development program has led to a therapeutic called Denosumab which
is in Phase III clinical trials. In addition to helping patients with osteoporosis, bone
metastasis,  and  other  serious  bone  loss  conditions,  this  drug  could  become  a  highly
effective  countermeasure  for  future  flight  crews  exposed  to  long-duration  skeletal
unloading.  In  the  context  of  the  ISS  National  Lab,  this  project  shows  the  potential
for  industry-sponsored  research  to  benefit  the  company,  NASA’s  exploration  vision
and the general public.

As  part  of  a  Space  Act  Agreement  that  is  being  completed  between  NASA  and
BioServe to support ISS National Lab commercial path-finder research, BioServe re-
cently  collaborated  with  SPACEHAB,  Inc.  to  launch  a  series  of  commercially  appli-
cable experiments in the area of vaccine development for certain infectious diseases.
The first of these payloads launched in March on-board STS–123 and the second is
scheduled to launch in May on-board STS–124. The results, while still preliminary,
are very encouraging. SPACEHAB, which is represented here today, can speak more
to this promising work.

Additionally,  BioServe  supported  four  NASA  peer-reviewed  life  science  research-
ers on-board STS–123. The Microbial Drug Resistance and Virulence or MDRV pay-
load  was  sponsored  by  NASA’s  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  under  the
non-exploration  research  program.  As  the  payload  name  implies,  the  research  con-
ducted  by  these  investigators  focused  on  the  effects  of  space  flight  on  virulence  in
pathogenic  microbes,  specifically  bacteria,  and  antifungal  resistance  in  a  yeast
model organism. This research has tremendous space- and Earth-based applications.
Again, one of the investigators from this mission is here today and can speak to the
value of this important work.

BioServe  has  a  long  history  of  providing  training  and  educational  opportunities
to  graduate,  undergraduate  and  K–12  students.  The  Center  has  trained  and  edu-
cated  over  115  graduate  students  since  its  inception.  BioServe  students  are  highly
sought  by  NASA  and  industry  once  they  graduate  due  to  the  unique  education  in
bioastronautics  and  hands-on  training  received  within  the  Aerospace  Engineering
Sciences  department  and  at  the  Center.  This  important  benefit  of  the  ISS  National
Lab simply cannot be overstated. With the sharp cuts by NASA in the physical and
life sciences, universities and colleges have lost critical support for students to keep
them  engaged  in  these  important  fields.  More  importantly,  academic  institutions
have lost the single largest set of opportunities for students to be involved with the
human  space  program.  Without  this  connection,  I  fear  that  fewer  and  fewer  stu-
dents  will  pursue  lines  of  study  and  choose  careers  associated  with  NASA’s  ambi-
tious Vision for Exploration. The ISS National Lab has the potential to restore some
of these lost opportunities.

In  late  2006  BioServe  started  a  formal  K–12  education  program  called  CSI.  CSI
brings  actual  space  flight  experiments  into  the  K–12  classroom.  Through  its  edu-
cation  partners,  curriculum  supplements  are  developed  for  each  CSI  experiment.
These  materials  are  delivered  to  participating  classroom  teachers  via  the  Internet.
Once  the  experiment  is  activated  on-orbit,  images  and  data  of  the  experiment  are
down-linked  to  BioServe  and  then  up-linked  to  the  educational  web  site.  Students
are able to conduct their own ‘‘ground controls’’ in the classroom and compare their
results  on  a  near-real  time  basis  to  the  space  experiment.  These  experiments  have
examined  seed  germination,  growth  of  metallic  salts  in  silicate  solutions,  multi-
generational  organism  growth  in  space  and  plant  development.  The  CSI–01  and
CSI–02 projects have reached over 10,000 students. This program is an excellent ex-
ample  of  utilizing  a  national  asset,  the  ISS,  to  inspire  K–12  students  in  science,
technology, engineering and math. It utilizes a unique element, the ISS, to promote
inquiry  of  gravity’s  effects  and  influence  on  our  every  day  lives.  In  turn,  this  type
of activity creates a very real connection between students and parents and the tre-
mendous accomplishments of NASA and the ISS.

This  brief  description  of  work  we  have  recently  been  conducting  provides  what  I
believe is only a very small glimpse into what could be possible on the ISS National
Lab if research utilization were significantly stepped up. There is great potential to
use ISS to advance applications in biotechnology, life sciences, fluid physics, funda-
mental  physics,  combustion,  energy,  Earth  sciences,  materials  and  biomedicine.  Of
course,  there  are  critics  of  the  ISS  who  disagree  with  this  statement  as  would  be
expected when competing interests come into play. I would argue, however, that the
work  done  to  date  on  the  Shuttle  and  on  the  ISS  has  shown  the  potential  of  the
ISS National Laboratory to produce a rich return for taxpayers and that far greater
benefits  and  discoveries  await  us.  In  any  event,  strict  scientific  return  on  invest-
ment  should  not  be  the  sole  measure  of  the  worth  of  taking  the  ISS  National  Lab
to  the  next  level.  Like  it  or  not,  the  investment  to  build  and  assemble  ISS  in  orbit
has  been  made.  We  should  now  recognize  the  historically  unique  capability  of  this
tremendous  facility  and  exploit  that  capability  to  the  maximum  extent  possible
while we can.

Status of ISS National Lab Utilization

It  is  difficult  to  assess  the  current  status  of  ISS  utilization  without  first  consid-
ering  how  we  arrived  where  we  are  today.  It  is  well  known  that  NASA  policy  con-
cerning  utilization  of  the  ISS  changed  dramatically  in  January  2004  with  the  re-
lease of the new Vision for U.S. Space Exploration. The new vision for NASA clearly
enumerated that the NASA Administrator should:

• ‘‘Complete  assembly  of  the  International  Space  Station,  including  the  U.S.
components that support the U.S. space exploration goals and those provided
by foreign partners, planned for the end of this decade;’’
• ‘‘Focus  U.S.  research  and  use  of  the  International  Space  Station  on  sup-
porting  space  exploration  goals,  with  emphasis  on  understanding  how  the
space  environment  affects  astronaut  health  and  capabilities  and  developing
countermeasures.’’

Two  significant  decisions  by  NASA  leadership  pertinent  to  the  future  of  the  ISS

followed from the new Vision for Exploration policy:

1. NASA’s  life  and  physical  science  programs  were  drastically  cut  with  many
lines of research being eliminated altogether. Even life sciences research that
was seen as supportive of the Vision for Space Exploration but was more fun-
damental  in  nature  or  involved  pre-clinical  animal  models,  was  effectively
canceled.  For  many  scientists  within  NASA  and  at  universities  across  the
country,  these  decisions  translated  to  the  termination  of  grants  and  forced
the redirection of research programs, even whole careers. Hundreds of college
undergraduate  and  graduate  students  were  discouraged  from  engaging  in
physical  and  space  life  sciences  research.  The  development  of  much  of  the
life  and  physical  sciences  equipment  that  was  being  built  to  support  robust
research programs on the ISS was canceled.

2. As part of the realignment of NASA programs to the Vision for Exploration,
in  2006,  NASA  terminated  the  Space  Product  Development  program,  which
at  the  time  supported  11  Research  Partnership  Centers  around  the  country,
including  ours.  Many  of  these  centers  were  engaged  in  commercial  research
and development activities that planned to utilize the ISS.

These  changes,  along  with  others,  certainly  had  the  desired  effect  to  reprogram
significant funding and define budgets to carry out the Vision for Space Exploration

and  help  focus  NASA  squarely  on  the  development  of  replacement  vehicles  to  the
Space Shuttle and the development of plans and hardware systems to return to the
Moon.

Of  course  these  decisions  also  placed  in  serious  doubt  the  future  of  the  ISS  as  a
world-class,  productive  research  laboratory  in  space,  as  had  been  originally  envi-
sioned. The momentum that had been built up by the collective efforts of thousands
of  people  was  depleted  by  these  decisions  in  what  seemed  a  very  short  period  of
time.  There  are  in  fact  few  organizations  remaining  today  with  the  knowledge  and
expertise  to  conduct  ISS  utilization.  Even  now,  these  organizations  are  at  risk  of
disappearing altogether and would take years to recreate.

The  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  designated  the  U.S.  segment  of  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station  as  a  National  Laboratory.  This  designation  was  made  as  a
result of strong leadership within Congress who recognized that limiting ISS utiliza-
tion  to  only  exploration  research  would  do  a  disservice  to  the  taxpaying  public  and
the myriad of ISS stakeholders who should expect a reasonable return from the ISS
in the form of scientific advances, new technologies, economic development, inspira-
tion  of  education  in  technical  fields  and  overall  societal  enrichment.  This  designa-
tion clearly opened the door to re-establishing the ISS as an important and produc-
tive R&D facility.

The designation of the ISS as a National Lab represents an important step in the
right  direction.  However,  this  step  by  itself  is  insufficient  to  ensure  that  ISS  will
be  productive  in  supporting  high-value  R&D  activities.  In  my  view,  there  are  three
actions that need to be taken for the ISS National Lab to become successful.

1. Establish  an  independent  management  organization  to  provide  leadership

and oversight of the ISS National Lab R&D activities.

2. Provide  modest  funding  to  encourage  and  support  non-NASA  agencies,  U.S.

industry, universities, colleges and other organizations to utilize the ISS.

3. Ensure  regular,  reliable  and  frequent  transportation  access  to  and  from  the

ISS.

Please allow me to expand on each of these steps.

ISS National Lab Management Organization

The  ISS  National  Lab  designation  from  the  2005  Authorization  Act  establishes
the potential for the ISS to be used for non-exploration research but does not estab-
lish  a  path  by  which  this  is  to  happen.  In  essence,  this  designation  establishes  the
national  lab  facility  without  specifically  identifying  the  people  who  would  manage
it. Imagine if Brookhaven National Lab, with its incredible facilities, were operated
and  maintained  but  no  organization  existed  to  serve  the  extramural  research  sci-
entists  and  communities  who  might  want  to  use  the  facilities.  The  productivity  of
Brookhaven’s facilities would drop off precipitously.

The  NASA  Report  to  Congress  regarding  a  Plan  for  the  ISS  National  Laboratory
in  2007  partially  addressed  the  question  of  management.  In  the  report,  NASA  ac-
knowledged  the  issue  and  indicated  that  various  management  structures  had  been
considered  to  create  a  possible  future  ISS  National  Lab  management  organization.
The  report  went  on  to  recommend  a  two-phase  approach  to  implementation.  Phase
I,  which  is  currently  being  followed,  utilizes  the  expertise  of  a  small  project  office
at NASA headquarters under the direction of the Associate Administrator for Space
Operations. In this phase, NASA is focused on identifying end-users of the ISS Na-
tional  Lab  and  securing  agreements  intended  to  provide  access  to  NASA  expertise
and  eventual  access  to  ISS  for  R&D  activities.  Phase  II  would  occur  depending  on
whether  demand  for  access  to  the  ISS  National  Lab  evolved  to  a  scale  that  would
warrant  such  an  organization.  In  this  event,  ‘‘NASA  could  establish  an  institute,  or
other  cost-effective  entity,  to  manage  opportunities  for  non-government  organizations
that are pursing applications unrelated to the NASA mission.’’

I am very encouraged by the steps that NASA has so far taken in creating a small
project office at headquarters and by the accomplishments of this office. Clearly, our
Center  is  a  beneficiary  of  the  work  of  this  office  through  the  Space  Act  Agreement
about to be completed. However, demand for the use of the ISS is already high and
continuing  to  grow.  This  can  be  evidenced,  in  part,  by  the  increasing  number  of
agreements  being  formed  with  NASA  by  various  organizations  including,  commer-
cial,  academic  and  government,  all  of  which  are  interested  in  utilizing  the  ISS.
Many of the witnesses here today are testifying about these interests. I would argue
that now is the time to move into the second phase of the ISS National Lab manage-
ment  strategy  identified  in  NASA’s  report.  An  effective  management  organization
put  into  place  now  should  have  a  strong  initial  focus  on  expanding  the  user  base
by  providing  outreach  to  scientists,  engineers  and  leaders  of  R&D  organizations.

This would continue to build demand for ISS utilization, which would lay the foun-
dation for a high level of productivity of the ISS National Lab soon after completion
of the ISS facility in 2010.

How  can  an  organization  capable  of  leading  ISS  National  Lab  utilization  be  cre-
ated  in  a  short  time  frame?  One  approach  could  be  pursued  by  the  ISS  National
Lab office at NASA headquarters. Specifically, this office could seek interested par-
ties,  identify  one  or  more  qualified  organizations  and  then  proceed  to  execute  a
Space  Act  Agreement  that  would  establish  a  public-private  partnership  to  oversee
ISS  National  Lab  utilization  on  behalf  of  multiple  users.  I  have  recently  become
aware  of  one  such  organization  that  allows  me  to  believe  that  this  approach  would
be  possible.  The  Biotechnology  Space  Research  Alliance  (BSRA)  is  a  self-organized
partnership between university, industry, foundation and economic development or-
ganizations. The purpose of BSRA is to facilitate access to the ISS National Lab and
create  benefits  for  the  biotechnology  industry  sector  in  Southern  California.  This
represents  a  possible  model  of  how  an  ISS  National  Lab  management  organization
might be structured. It should also be pointed out that BSRA could grow to support
other industry sectors and expand to meet the needs of other regions across the Na-
tion.

The  ISS  National  Lab  management  organization  should  be  chartered  to  develop
and manage a rich portfolio of non-exploration research activities on the ISS. To be
clear,  this  organization  would  not  be  intended  to  replace  the  office  at  NASA  head-
quarters but rather to greatly augment its efforts. This organization also would not
replace  any  of  the  responsibilities  of  NASA’s  Payloads  Office,  which  serves  to  inte-
grate  requirements  for  flight  research  across  all  users  of  the  ISS  including  explo-
ration and non-exploration research, but rather work hand-in-hand with this group.
An  effective  ISS  research  management  organization  would  have  a  number  of  key

responsibilities in supporting the ISS National Lab:

1. Perform  outreach  to  scientists  across  multiple  disciplines  such  as  physics,
materials science, life science, biomedicine, chemistry, Earth science, etc. The
organization  would  educate  scientists  and  others  on  the  known  effects  of
gravity,  the  space  environment  and  other  space  attributes  and  how  con-
ducting  studies  on  the  ISS  might  benefit  their  research.  The  ISS  would  es-
sentially be marketed to prospective university, government and commercial
users.  The  goal  would  be  to  identify  researchers  whose  work  could  benefit
the  most  from  utilizing  the  ISS  and  develop  a  substantial  portfolio  of  pro-
spective R&D projects.

2. Develop  a  selection  process  to  prioritize  and  support  the  best  research  from
a  regularly  updated  list  of  candidates.  The  goal  would  be  to  serve  as  a  fair
broker  in  selecting  research,  particularly  when  flight  resources  are  con-
strained,  based  on  criteria  that  would  be  established  by  the  organization
when it is formed.

3. Work  to  seamlessly  integrate  and  fly  research  as  a  turn-key  operation.  The
goal would be to take responsibility for the onerous process of flying research
so that the scientists can focus solely on their science.

4. Work  closely  with  the  ISS  Payloads  Office  to  streamline  the  process  of  inte-
grating  and  certifying  research  for  flight.  The  goal  would  be  to  shorten  the
payload  processing  timeline  as  much  as  possible  so  as  to  maximize  the  pro-
ductivity of the ISS National Lab.

5. Maintain  a  database  with  key  specifications  for  all  space  flight  research
hardware  that  might  be  used  on  the  ISS.  In  some  cases,  the  organization
might  maintain  an  inventory  of  flight  hardware  and  make  this  hardware
available,  as  needed.  The  goal  would  be  to  match  the  best  available  hard-
ware with a particular research project to avoid duplicate hardware develop-
ment.

6. Assist  NASA  to  archive  results  from  work  performed  on  the  ISS  and  effec-

tively communicate these results to the public.

ISS National Lab Utilization Costs

Performing research in orbit is more expensive than comparable ground-based re-
search.  Conducting  a  research  investigation  on  the  ISS  could  include  1)  the  cost  of
the  science  itself  (research  team,  materials,  analyses,  etc.),  2)  the  cost  for  develop-
ment of new hardware necessary to meet the science objectives, 3) the costs for pay-
load  integration,  operations,  preparation  and  flight  certification,  4)  the  costs  of
transportation  to  and  from  the  Space  Station  and,  5)  use  of  the  ISS  and  associated
resources (power, crew time, volume, etc.).

36

Within  the  concept  of  ISS  as  a  National  Lab,  it  is  appropriate  that  the  research
sponsor  or  beneficiary  would  cover  the  cost  of  the  research  itself.  This  expectation
would  apply  whether  the  work  was  being  sponsored  by  a  commercial,  academic  or
government  organization.  In  short,  whoever  brings  research  ideas  forward  and  ex-
pects  to  benefit  from  those  ideas  should  cover  the  full  costs  for  executing  the  re-
search.

On the other end of the spectrum, it is currently NASA’s policy to cover the costs
associated  with  Space  Shuttle  transportation  and  the  use  of  the  ISS  utilization  re-
sources.  Compared  with  the  costs  being  borne  by  NASA  to  launch  the  Shuttle,  and
assemble  and  operate  the  ISS,  costs  for  transporting  research  and  use  of  ISS  re-
sources for utilization are certainly marginal. Assuming that the costs for use of ISS
resources  continue  to  be  covered  by  NASA  for  the  foreseeable  future,  the  obvious
question  is  what  happens  to  the  transportation  costs  after  the  ISS  is  complete  and
the  Space  Shuttle  is  retired  in  2010?  Without  doubt,  this  question  poses  a  signifi-
cant risk to ISS R&D productivity post-assembly complete. Transportation costs for
ISS  National  Lab  research  communities  after  2010  need  to  be  understood  as  soon
as  possible  so  they  can  be  taken  into  account  in  laying  a  plan  for  productive  ISS
utilization. I’ll address more on the subject of transportation shortly.

Cost  categories  2  and  3  present  a  different  type  of  challenge.  The  costs  of  devel-
oping  new  hardware  and  meeting  all  of  the  NASA  requirements  associated  with
safety, integration, operations and flight certification can be significant. These costs
are  not  ones  that  are  normally  associated  with  terrestrial  research  and,  as  such,
even with the transportation cost excepted, the cost for conducting a research inves-
tigation on the ISS may be anywhere from two- to tenfold higher than a comparable
ground investigation. These costs could impose a high barrier to research utilization
of the ISS. Passing these costs to the end user will discourage high-risk, high-payoff
research  on  the  ISS.  One  obvious  solution  might  be  to  provide  modest  funding  to
the ISS National Lab management organization so the organization can assume the
responsibility for performing and meeting all NASA payload integration, operations
and  flight  requirements.  If  research  is  selected  for  flight  through  an  appropriate
prioritization and vetting process, then the ISS National Lab organization could as-
sume  the  responsibility  and  costs  for  its  execution  in  orbit.  This  approach  would
have  the  important  advantage  that  neither  the  research  sponsor  nor  the  science
team will need to learn the daunting process for integrating and certifying an inves-
tigation  for  flight.  At  the  same  time,  more  high-risk,  high-payoff  experiments  will
be possible.

ISS National Lab Utilization Transportation

After  the  Space  Shuttle  is  retired  in  2010,  the  options  for  transporting  research
between  Earth  and  the  ISS  become  limited.  At  this  point,  the  U.S.  Space  Shuttle,
the Russian Soyuz and Progress vehicles and now the European Space Agency’s Au-
tonomous Transfer Vehicle are the only means for transporting research equipment,
supplies and samples. By 2009–2010, the H–II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) being devel-
oped  by  JAXA  should  have  a  similar  capability  to  transport  cargo  to  the  ISS.  Of
these,  only  the  Space  Shuttle  has  significant  capacity  for  transport  back  to  Earth
and  yet  it  will  be  retired  exactly  at  the  time  that  research  on  the  ISS  should  be
significantly stepped up. Without a solution to this dilemma, ISS National Lab utili-
zation  will  be  crippled.  The  only  research  that  will  be  practically  possible,  other
than  exploration  research  involving  the  station  crews  as  test  subjects,  will  be  re-
search  where  data  are  generated  on-orbit  and  samples  and  payload  equipment  are
considered  disposable  and  incinerated  in  the  atmosphere  after  use.  While  this  ap-
proach  might  work  for  some  investigations,  the  technology  necessary  to  do  this  on
a  large  scale  on  the  ISS  has  not  been  developed  nor  are  there  any  plans  to  do  so.
NASA  should  be  credited  for  pursuing  commercial  options  for  ISS  resupply.  The
Commercial  Orbital  Transportation  Services  or  COTS  providers  may  help  to  solve
the transportation problem for the ISS National Lab. The release by NASA only re-
cently  of  the  request  for  proposals  for  Cargo  Resupply  Services  (CRS)  represents  a
critical  step  forward  and  suggests  a  certain  level  of  confidence  that  one  or  more
COTS  providers  will  step  up  and  be  able  to  meet  the  cargo  resupply  and  sample
return  needs  of  NASA  and  the  ISS.  To  be  clear,  the  solicitation  appears  to  only
cover NASA’s needs for logistics and science materials and equipment. The solicita-
tion  does  not  cover  ISS  National  Lab  research  users.  Instead,  NASA’s  expectation
is  that  prospective  ISS  National  Lab  users  will  independently  negotiate  transpor-
tation to meet their needs.

There  are  two  concerns  with  NASA’s  approach  to  the  CRS  procurement  from  the

perspective of ISS National Lab users.

First,  in  planning  for  success  with  the  ISS  National  Lab,  there  will  be  many  dif-
ferent users needing to make transportation arrangements. Clearly, having multiple

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

37

organizations,  such  as  individual  companies,  agencies,  government  labs,  even  indi-
vidual scientists, all approaching the successful COTS provider for a ride will create
some  degree  of  chaos.  More  importantly,  it  is  not  clear  how  coordination  between
ISS  National  Lab  users  and  NASA  (logistics  resupply  and  exploration  science)  will
be  done.  It  is  my  opinion  that  the  ISS  National  Lab  will  be  most  productive  if  re-
search  material  can  be  transported  both  up  and  down  on  a  schedule  of  4–5  times
per  year  or  more.  This  schedule  will  provide  the  greatest  flexibility  to  meet  the  re-
quirements  of  multiple  end  users.  ISS  National  Lab  users  should  be  included  on
every  NASA  procured  shipment.  This  will  require  careful  coordination  between  the
ISS  National  Lab  management  organization  and  NASA.  For  now  while  the  Cargo
Resupply  Services  are  being  procured,  NASA  needs  to  plan  to  include  perhaps  20–
25  percent  of  the  volume  on  each  supply  mission  for  the  ISS  National  Lab  work.
Second,  the  cost  of  this  component  of  the  research,  as  mentioned  above,  could  be
the  most  severe  challenge  of  all.  Without  knowing  the  charges  for  transportation
that  the  selected  Cargo  Resupply  Services  providers  will  decide  is  needed  to  allow
them  to  recoup  their  investment,  it  is  difficult  to  know  how  to  predict  this  critical
cost  component.  However,  as  a  point  of  reference,  a  reasonable  approximation  that
has  been  previously  used  is  $20,000  to  launch  and  return  a  kilogram  of  mass.  Of
course  the  actual  charge  could  be  different,  either  higher  or  lower.  Based  on  this
value,  one  modest  sized  experiment,  comparable  to  what  is  currently  flown  in  the
Shuttle  mid-deck,  would  cost  over  $600,000  to  transport  to  and  from  the  ISS.  Add
the  cost  of  integration,  operations  and  safety  certification  (category  3  discussed
above)  and  an  experiment  may  cost  ∼$1,000,000.  Add  the  cost  of  any  modest  new
hardware  development,  if  suitable  existing  hardware  cannot  be  found,  and  the  cost
for a single experiment may reach as high as $2,000,000, a cost prohibitive to most
research sponsors.

Conducting  research  on  the  ISS  National  Lab  is  going  to  require  5–10  times  the
investment  for  comparable  research  on  the  ground.  The  transportation  element  is
a  significant  portion  of  this  cost.  As  previously  stated,  if  this  cost  must  be  fully
borne  by  the  ISS  National  Lab  users,  then  there  will  be  a  very  high  barrier  that
many  end  users  may  choose  not  to  cross.  This  will  have  the  unfortunate  effect  of
precluding  a  number  of  excellent  ideas  and  projects  from  going  forward  under  the
ISS  National  Lab.  Keep  in  mind  that  some  of  the  best  and  most  successful  ideas
originate  with  entrepreneurial  individuals  or  start-up  companies,  which  may  have
little investment capital on hand.

The  issue  of  transportation  and  cost  go  hand  in  hand.  One  solution  might  be  for
the  ISS  National  Lab  management  organization,  if  it  were  to  be  established,  to  be
given  sufficient  funding  outside  of  NASA  to  negotiate  transportation  contracts  with
the COTS providers on behalf of all ISS National Lab users. This would need to be
done  working  with  NASA  to  ensure  sufficient  capacity  could  be  made  available  on
each delivery mission to the ISS for ISS National Lab users.

The greatest risk to the ISS National Lab failing to deliver on its research poten-
tial,  in  my  opinion,  is  that  the  COTS  providers  may  not  succeed  in  developing  an
ISS  re-supply  capability  soon  enough  or  perhaps  at  all.  Even  though  NASA  is  in-
vesting  $500M  into  this  program,  considerably  more  investment  capital  is  required
from  each  of  the  COTS  companies  for  these  new  rocket  and  spacecraft  systems  to
be  developed  and  tested  and  to  meet  NASA’s  safety  requirements  to  dock  with  the
ISS.  Having  a  successful  commercial  transportation  provider  is  strategically  and
technically  important  to  the  U.S.  Without  a  U.S.  provider,  we  will  be  purchasing
extensive  services  from  the  Russians  (Progress  and  Soyuz  vehicles)  and  there  will
still be insufficient return mass capability to meet anyone’s needs. All ISS research,
including  that  of  NASA  and  the  ISS  National  Lab,  will  be  crippled.  While  there  is
no simple solution to this issue, it is one that NASA should carefully consider, per-
haps with the development of a contingency plan to assist any selected Commercial
Resupply Services providers, if they encounter major technical difficulties.

Summary of Key Points and Recommendations

the Nation in commerce, science, medicine, technology and education.

• The  ISS  National  Lab  has  tremendous  potential  to  advance  the  interests  of
• Not  enough  is  being  done  to  ensure  that  the  ISS  National  Lab  will  succeed
in what should be the most productive time for the highly capable ISS facility
after assembly is complete. Given the finite period of time that it can be safe-
ly assumed to be operational, perhaps only 5–10 years, it will be very impor-
tant  to  accommodate  as  many  of  the  best  research  and  development  ideas  as
possible.
• Transportation  of  research  utilization  equipment  and  materials  to  and  from
the  ISS  with  a  frequency  of  at  least  4–5  times  per  year  is  critical.  With  the

Shuttle  retiring  in  2010,  the  only  other  viable  option  will  be  for  one  or  more
COTS providers to be successful at developing new launch vehicles and dock-
ing-capable  spacecraft.  NASA  is  pursuing  this  solution  with  the  recently  re-
leased solicitation for Cargo Resupply Services.

• Recommendations

a. NASA  should  proceed  to  identify  and  select  an  ISS  National  Lab  man-
agement organization as soon as possible. (Described in NASA’s Plan for
the  ISS  National  Laboratory.)  Time  is  of  the  essence  when  considering
what must be done to set the stage for full ISS National Lab utilization
after 2010. Use of a Space Act Agreement to form a public-private part-
nership could allow this to be done relatively quickly.

b. Once  it  is  formed,  the  ISS  National  Lab  management  organization
should  be  given  adequate  resources  to  identify,  manage  and  support  a
rich  portfolio  of  utilization  projects.  The  organization  should  not  cover
science costs, as those will be the responsibility of the research sponsor,
but  should  be  structured  to  cover  some  or  all  of  the  additional  costs
(hardware, integration, operations, transportation, etc.) not normally as-
sociated with terrestrial research. This approach could change over time
as  demand  for  the  ISS  increases  where  more  and  more  of  the  full  costs
are covered by the end users.

c. NASA should plan to fully accommodate ISS National Lab transportation
needs in their effort to secure Cargo Resupply Services. At the least, this
should  include  setting  aside  20–25  percent  of  the  up  and  down  volume
and mass on any given ISS resupply vehicle, even if that means that the
number of total commercial launches per year must be increased.

Louis S. Stodieck, Ph.D. is the Director of BioServe Space Technologies and Asso-
ciate Research Professor in Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University of Col-
orado, Boulder. Dr. Stodieck earned his doctorate in Aerospace Engineering from the
University  of  Colorado,  Boulder  in  1985.  His  research  focus  was  biomedical  engi-
neering. He trained for two years as a postdoctoral Medical Research Council Fellow
in the Department of Physiology at the University of British Columbia. He returned

name is Cheryl Nickerson. I am an Associate Professor in the Cen-
ter  for  Infectious  Diseases  and  Vaccinology  at  the  Biodesign  Insti-
tute at Arizona State University. I have been the principal investi-
gator on multiple NASA-funded life science experiments. I serve as
a  consultant  to  the  NASA  Life  Sciences  Program  at  the  Johnson
Space Center, and I was honored to have been selected as a NASA
astronaut candidate finalist in 2003.

In  your  invitation  letter  today  you  posed  a  series  of  questions  to
me regarding the utilization prospects by ISS research that I would
like to now address in sequence.

First, what had been the nature of my space-based research, and
what had been my findings to date? My research focuses on under-
standing  the  molecular  mechanisms  of  infectious  disease  and  spe-
cifically  on  the  affect  of  space  flight  on  the  molecular  mechanisms
of  infectious  disease,  with  an  important  emphasis  on  the  microbial
pathogen response.

Infectious disease is responsible for 35 percent of all deaths glob-
ally,  and  it  is  the  world’s  largest  killer  of  children  and  young
adults.  The  economic  impact  on  the  U.S.  alone  from  infectious  dis-
ease  exceeds  $120  billion  annually,  and  of  course,  future  threats
loom  on  the  horizon  for  us  globally  as  well,  including  new  and  re-
emerging  infectious  diseases  for  which  we  do  not  have  sufficient
treatments,  antibiotic  resistance  strains,  and  always  the  potential
for  the  intentional  misuse  of  microbial  pathogens  as  agents  of  bio-
terrorism.  Clearly  then  new  treatment  and  prevention  paradigms
are desperately needed.

My space flight research is focused on the bacterial pathogen Sal-
monella, which is a global threat to public health and it counts for
approximately  30  percent  of  all  deaths  from  food-borne  illness  in
the  United  States.  From  NASA’s  perspective  Salmonella  is  consid-
ered  a  potential  source  of  infection  during  space  flight  that  could
incapacitate  crew  members  during  a  mission.  However,  there  are
currently  no  human  vaccines  to  prevent  Salmonella  food-borne  ill-
ness.

I  applaud  NASA’s  foresight  in  funding  our  space  flight  research
in the field of infectious diseases, as well as the awesome engineers
for building this wonderful ISS craft. The connection between space
flight  and  infectious  diseases  was  not  immediately  clear  10  years
ago when NASA originally funded our research. Based on our early
findings using ground base space flight analogs, NASA awarded us
a  grant  to  investigate  the  effect  of  true  space  flight  on  Salmonella
disease-causing  ability,  which  we  call  virulence,  and  gene  expres-
sion results. This experiment flew on STS–115 in September of ’06,
and the results were remarkable. They showed that space flight in-
creased  the  virulence  of  this  important  pathogen  and  globally  al-
tered its gene expression profiles by changing 167 genes.

Now,  the  interesting  part  about  that  is  it  not  only  increased  its
disease-causing  potential  and  changed  all  these  expression  of
genes, but it did so in unique ways that are not observed using tra-
ditional  experimental  approaches  in  the  laboratory.  So  what  we
have done is we have been able to discover new ways that this im-
portant human pathogen causes disease in the host.

We also discovered a key master regulatory mechanism that con-
trols  the  vast  majority  of  the  Salmonella’s  responses  to  the  space

flight  environment.  This  molecular  target,  along  with  others  that
we identified in my laboratory, holds real potential to be translated
into  new  therapeutics  and  new  vaccines  to  treat  and  prevent
human enteric food-borne illness caused by Salmonella.

Our  findings  were  published  in  the  proceedings  of  the  National
Academy of Sciences. The success of our flight experiment on STS–
115  inspired  a  follow-up  experiment  on  STS–123,  which  just  flew
in March, 2008, and the results from that are equally exciting, and
we  are  looking  forward  to  publishing  those  within  the  next  one  to
two months.

An  important  part  of  our  space  flight  work  is  helping  us  to  un-
derstand,  therefore,  how  microbial  pathogens  cause  infectious  dis-
ease  here  on  Earth,  and  likewise,  then  using  space  flight  as  a
novel,  enabling  research  platform  to  translate  those  innovations
into infectious disease control here for the general public on Earth.
Shortly  we  expect  NASA  and  the  public  to  receive  a  direct  benefit
from their investment in our work.

Second,  what  is  my  perspective  on  the  future  potential  for  the
use  of  microgravity  environment  as  a  research  tool?  It  is  simple.
The  microgravity  of  space  flight  offers  a  unique  environment  for
ground-breaking  biotechnology  and  biomedical  advances  and  dis-
coveries  to  globally  advance  human  health.  Not  just  in  infectious
diseases  but  in  some  of  the  major  health  illnesses  here  that  we
worry  about  globally.  Cancer,  aging,  bone  and  muscle  wasting  dis-
eases,  and  tissue  engineering.  And  it  will  have  a  long-lasting  im-
pact  on  our  nation’s  scientific  capability,  economy,  and  the  quality
of our lives.

Many  breakthroughs  in  life  sciences  research  have  come  from
studying living systems in extreme environments. The environment
of  space  flight  offers  insight  into  fundamental  cellular  and  molec-
ular  response  mechanisms  that  are  directly  relevant  to  human
health and disease and which cannot be observed using traditional
experimental approaches in the lab.

Third,  and  my  final  question.  What  are  any  potential  applica-
tions  of  the  basic  research  I  have  conducted  to  date  or  intend  to
pursue?  The  investment  that  NASA  has  made  in  our  research  for
innovations in infectious disease treatment and control will provide
long-lasting  return  in  the  protection  of  humans  as  they  explore
space and for the general public here on Earth.

An  example  of  the  potential  boom  from  space  flight  experiments
is  my  laboratory’s  discovery  that  gene  regulatory  proteins  partici-
pate in the space flight response of microbial pathogens. Gene reg-
ulatory proteins affect every property of a cell, including its ability
to  cause  disease.  My  lab  is  currently  studying  how  this  regulatory
and  these  regulatory  pathways  work  in  Salmonella  and  other  im-
portant human pathogens and how they can be manipulated to con-
trol  microbial  virulence  and  subsequently,  how  those  findings  can
be  translated  to  the  design  of  new  drugs  and  new  vaccines  with
clinical applications.

One  key  to  our  nation’s  economic  success  has  been  its  ability  to
consistently  provide  unique  answers  to  the  world’s  problems.  We
have the opportunity here and now to advance in a field where the
U.S.  is  a  world  leader.  I  firmly  believe  that  space  exploration  and

development will be one of the defining activities of our nation that
will lead the world in this new millennium.

And I thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHERYL A. NICKERSON

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  appear
before  you  today  to  testify.  My  name  is  Cheryl  Nickerson,  and  I  am  an  Associate
Professor in the Center for Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology at the Biodesign In-
stitute  at  Arizona  State  University.  My  research  focuses  on  understanding  the  mo-
lecular mechanisms and processes of infectious disease, with an important emphasis
on  investigating  the  unique  effect  of  space  flight  on  microbial  pathogen  responses.
NASA’s  support  of  my  research  has  resulted  in  multiple  space  flight  experiments,
which have provided novel insight into how microbial pathogens cause infection both
during flight and on Earth, and hold promise for new drug and vaccine development
to combat infectious disease.

Through  awards  such  as  the  Presidential  Early  Career  Award  for  Scientists  and
Engineers,  and  independent  research  funding  from  grants  totaling  over  three  mil-
lion  dollars,  NASA  has  consistently  recognized  my  laboratory’s  contributions  to  the
United States Space Program into infectious disease risks for the crew during space
flight  and  the  general  public  here  on  Earth.  I  also  serve  as  a  scientific  consultant
for NASA at the Johnson Space Center in support of their efforts to determine and
mitigate  microbial  risks  to  the  crew  during  flight,  and  was  honored  to  be  selected
as a NASA Astronaut candidate finalist for the Astronaut class of 2004. That being
said, the views expressed in today’s testimony are my own, but I believe they reflect
community concerns.

In  your  invitation  letter  asking  me  to  testify  before  you  today  you  asked  a  series
of questions regarding the utilization prospects of ISS research that I would like to
address now in sequence.
1. What  has  been  the  nature  of  your  space-based  research,  and  what  have

been your findings to date?
I  would  like  to  begin  by  applauding  NASA’s  foresight  in  funding  our  space  flight
research in the field of infectious disease. We were initially funded by NASA’s Office
of Biological and Physical Research and are currently funded by both the Advanced
Capabilities  Division  and  the  Human  Research  Program  in  the  Explorations  Sys-
tems  Mission  Directorate.  The  connection  between  space  flight  and  its  influence  on
infectious  disease  was  not  immediately  clear  10  years  ago  when  NASA  initially
funded  our  research.  As  a  result,  NASA’s  support  of  my  research  through  multiple
space  flight  experiments  has  allowed  us  to  provide  novel  insight  into  the  molecular
mechanisms  that  microbial  pathogens  use  to  cause  infectious  disease  both  during
flight and on Earth, and has exciting implications for translation into human health
benefits,  including  the  development  of  new  drugs  and  vaccines  for  treatment  and
prevention.

While  the  eradication  or  control  of  many  microbial  diseases  has  dramatically  im-
proved the health outlook of our society, infectious diseases are still a leading cause
of  human  death  and  illness  worldwide.  Infectious  disease  causes  35  percent  of
deaths  worldwide,  and  is  the  world’s  biggest  killer  of  children  and  young  adults.
Within the United States, infectious disease has a tremendous social, economic, and
security impact. Total cost for infectious disease in the U.S. exceeds $120 billion an-
nually  due  to  direct  medical  and  lost  productivity  costs.  Moreover,  the  future  is
threatened by new and re-emerging infectious diseases, an alarming increase in an-
tibiotic  resistance,  and  the  use  of  microbial  agents  as  a  bioterrorist  threat.  Thus,
research  platforms  that  offer  new  insight  into  how  pathogens  cause  infection  and
disease  are  desperately  needed  and  will  lead  to  novel  strategies  for  treatment  and
prevention.

To  enhance  our  understanding  of  how  pathogens  cause  disease  in  the  infected
host, my laboratory uses innovative approaches to investigate the molecular mecha-
nisms  of  infectious  disease.  It  was  this  search  for  novel  approaches  that  drove  our
initial investigations with NASA technology. As flight experiments are a rare oppor-
tunity, our early experimental efforts concentrated on the use of a unique bioreactor,
called  the  Rotating  Wall  Vessel  (RWV),  designed  at  the  NASA  Johnson  Space  Cen-
ter in Houston as a ground-based space flight analogue. The RWV bioreactor allows
scientists  to  culture  cells  (microbial  or  mammalian)  in  the  laboratory  under  condi-
tions  that  mimic  several  aspects  of  space  flight  and  can  be  used  to  induce  many  of
the  biological  changes  that  occur  during  space  flight.  In  addition,  by  using  mathe-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

42

matical  modeling,  we  found  that  this  analogue,  and  true  space  flight,  produce  an
environment  that  is  relevant  to  conditions  encountered  by  the  pathogen  during  in-
fection in the human host—thus enhancing the relevance of our findings for the de-
velopment of new strategies to combat infectious disease on Earth.

We  chose  the  model  bacterial  pathogen  Salmonella  typhimurium  for  both  our
space flight analogue and space flight studies, as it is the best characterized patho-
gen and poses a risk to both the crew during flight and the general public on Earth.
Salmonella is the most readily and fully understood pathogen and belongs to a large
group  of  bacteria  whose  natural  habitat  is  the  intestinal  tract  of  humans  and  ani-
mals.  This  group  includes  most  of  the  bacteria  that  cause  intestinal  and  diarrheal
disease,  considered  to  be  one  of  the  greatest  health  problems  globally.  Indeed,  Sal-
monella infection is one of the most common food-borne infections worldwide. In the
United  States  an  estimated  1.41  million  cases  occur,  resulting  in  168,000  visits  to
physicians,  15,000  hospitalizations  and  580  deaths  annually.  Salmonella  accounts
for approximately 30 percent of deaths caused by food-borne infections in the United
States, and is even more detrimental in the developing world. The total cost associ-
ated with Salmonella infections in the U.S. is estimated at three billion dollars an-
nually.  Moreover,  in  1984,  Salmonella  was  used  in  a  bioterrorism  attack  by  a  reli-
gious  cult  in  Oregon  to  cause  a  community-wide  outbreak  of  food-borne  illness  in
an attempt to influence the outcome of a local election. The organism is also an ex-
cellent  choice  for  NASA  as  it  is  considered  a  potential  threat  to  crew  health  as  a
food  contaminant.  There  are  currently  no  human  vaccines  to  prevent  Salmonella
food-borne illness.

Using the RWV ground-based technology, we conducted preliminary studies show-
ing that Salmonella responded to this environment by globally altering its gene ex-
pression, stress resistance, and disease causing (virulence) profiles, thereby improv-
ing  our  chance  of  success  and  need  for  a  space  flight  experiment.  Subsequent  anal-
ysis  of  the  genes  that  were  expressed  after  growth  in  this  analogue  suggested  that
the environment induced unique molecular mechanisms in the microbe to cause dis-
ease.  Our  information  from  these  early  experiments  provided  NASA  with  new  in-
sight  toward  understanding  the  risk  of  infection  during  flight.  In  addition,  the
unique  molecular  mechanisms  that  were  identified  held  the  potential  to  be  used  to
develop new therapeutics and vaccines for the general public on Earth.

NASA  and  the  scientific  community  continued  their  support  of  our  ground-based
findings by awarding us a grant to investigate the effect of true space flight on Sal-
monella  virulence  and  gene  expression  responses.  This  was  an  exciting  opportunity
for  us,  as  while  the  RWV  bioreactor  can  simulate  some  aspects  of  the  space  flight
environment,  it  cannot  duplicate  all  of  the  physical  parameters  that  organisms  en-
counter  during  space  flight  or  their  biological  responses.  In  September  2006,  our
first  space  flight  experiment  flew  aboard  STS–115,  and  we  investigated  the  com-
prehensive  changes  in  Salmonella  when  exposed  to  the  truly  unique  environment
of microgravity. The results from this experiment were remarkable and showed that
during  space  flight,  Salmonella  altered  its  virulence  and  gene  expression  responses
in  unique  ways  that  are  not  observed  using  traditional  experimental  approaches.
These findings immediately advanced our knowledge of microbial responses to space
flight  and  disease  causing  mechanisms  used  by  this  important  human  pathogen.
Our  first  technical  report  from  this  space  flight  experiment  was  recently  published
in  the  Proceedings  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  and  our  results  dem-
onstrated  changes  in  Salmonella  disease  causing  potential  (virulence)  during  flight
as  compared  to  identical  samples  that  were  grown  on  the  ground.  Specifically,  our
findings  demonstrated  that  space  flight  increased  the  virulence  of  Salmonella,  and
the  pathogen  was  able  to  cause  disease  at  lower  doses.  In  addition,  we  identified
167  genes  in  Salmonella  that  changed  expression  in  response  to  space  flight.  The
identity  of  these  genes  allowed  us  to  discover  a  key  ‘‘master  switch’’  regulatory
mechanism  that  controls  Salmonella  responses  to  space  flight  environments.  This
molecular  target,  and  others  that  we  identified,  hold  potential  to  be  translated  into
new  therapeutic  and  vaccine  approaches  to  treat  and  prevent  human  enteric  sal-
monellosis.

This  experiment  was  a  ‘‘first  of  its  kind’’  in  space  flight  biological  study.  It  was
the  first  study  ever  to  investigate  the  effect  of  space  flight  on  the  disease-causing
potential  (virulence)  of  a  pathogen,  and  the  first  ever  to  obtain  the  entire  gene  ex-
pression  response  profiles  of  a  bacterium  to  space  flight.  In  fact,  very  few  studies
contain  data  that  document  gene  expression  changes  during  space  flight.  It  is  also
critical to mention that an important part of our space flight work is directly related
to  helping  us  understand  how  microbial  pathogens  cause  infectious  disease  here  on
Earth.  This  is  possible  because  the  unique  environment  of  space  flight  encountered
by  microorganisms  (including  pathogens)  are  also  relevant  to  conditions  that  these
cells encounter here on Earth during the normal course of their life cycles, including

43

certain niches within the infected host, such as parts of the human intestine. Thus,
an  exciting  part  of  this  work  is  the  opportunity  to  use  space  flight  and  the  ISS  as
a novel enabling research platform for innovations in infectious disease control here
on Earth—including novel insight into how pathogens cause disease and for the de-
velopment of new therapeutics and vaccines for treatment and prevention.

The success of our flight experiment aboard STS–115 inspired a follow-up experi-
ment aboard STS–123, which just flew in March 2008. While the data is still being
analyzed,  our  preliminary  findings  are  leading  toward  translational  applications  of
our original data for the development of novel strategies to treat and prevent infec-
tion and disease during flight and here on Earth. Shortly, we expect NASA and the
public to receive a direct benefit from their investment.

The  ISS  holds  tremendous  potential  to  provide  novel  insight  into  human  health
and  disease  mechanisms  that  can  lead  to  ground-breaking  new  treatments  to  com-
bat infectious disease and improve the quality of life.
2. What  is  your  perspective  on  the  future  potential  for  use  of  the  micro-

gravity environment as a research tool?
The microgravity of space flight offers a unique environment for ground-breaking
biotechnology  and  biomedical  innovations  and  discoveries  to  globally  advance
human health in the following areas:

– Infectious disease
– Immunology
– Cancer
– Aging
– Bone and muscle wasting diseases
– Development of biopharmaceuticals
– Tissue engineering

It  is  not  surprising  that  biological  systems  respond  in  novel  ways  to  the  space
flight  environment.  Many  breakthroughs  in  life  sciences  research  have  come  from
studying  living  systems  in  unique  and  extreme  environments.  It  is  from  studying
the  response  of  biological  systems  under  these  environments  that  we  have  not  only
gained new fundamental insight into how they function and adapt to extreme condi-
tions,  but  have  also  translated  these  findings  into  beneficial  biotechnology  and  bio-
medical advances to improve our quality of life. Space flight is simply the next log-
ical progression and extreme environment to study that holds tremendous potential
to provide the next ground-breaking advances in public health.

The  ISS  provides  a  unique  environment  where  researchers  can  explore  funda-
mental  questions  about  human  health—like  how  the  body  heals  itself  and  develops
disease.  Specifically,  the  ISS  offers  an  orbiting  laboratory  to  use  microgravity  as  a
tool to bring a new technological approach to understanding living systems and dis-
cover basic mechanisms we haven’t seen before. That is because organisms and cells
respond  in  unique  ways  to  space  flight  and  exhibit  characteristics  relevant  to
human  health  and  disease  that  they  do  not  when  cultured  using  traditional  condi-
tions  on  Earth.  Accordingly,  cellular  and  molecular  mechanisms  that  underlie  dis-
ease can be studied, offering new opportunities to see how cells operate in these con-
ditions, and giving new fundamental insight into the disease process. Many of these
findings  may  translate  directly  to  the  clinical  setting  for  novel  ways  to  diagnose,
treat and prevent disease here on Earth. This type of research creates exciting new
opportunities  for  the  utilization  of  ISS  to  advance  the  frontiers  of  knowledge  and
act  as  a  commercial  platform  for  breakthrough  biomedical  and  biotechnological  dis-
coveries.  I  believe  it  is  important  to  take  advantage  of  this  unique  research  facility
to  develop  new  advances  in  biotech  and  biomedicine  that  will  globally  advance
human health and benefit the United States in the international economy.

Thus, it is anticipated that ISS life sciences research will lead to ground-breaking
discoveries  and  innovations  in  human  health,  biotech  and  biomedical  innovations,
and  will  have  a  lasting  impact  on  our  nation’s  scientific  capability,  economy,  and
quality of our lives.
3. What are any potential applications of the basic research you have con-

ducted to date or intend to pursue?
The investment that NASA has made in our research for innovations in infectious
disease  treatment  and  control  will  provide  long  lasting  return  in  the  protection  of
humans  as  they  explore  space  and  for  the  general  public  here  on  Earth.  Regarding
protection  of  the  crew,  the  negative  impacts  of  infectious  disease  range  from  im-
peded  crew  performance  to  potentially  life  threatening  scenarios.  As  humans  travel

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

44

further away from our home planet, the risk to crew health and mission success be-
comes even greater. As we gain greater knowledge of the risks of microbial infection,
prudent  preventative  operational  activities,  therapeutics,  and  other  counter-
measures can be implemented to mitigate the risk to the crew and mission success.
Perhaps  the  greatest  application  from  this  research  will  not  apply  directly  to
space flight, but rather to improving the quality of life on Earth through the devel-
opment of novel strategies to combat infection and disease. Internationally, we face
many  challenges  to  our  health  by  microbial  threats.  Antibiotic  resistant  strains  are
on  the  rise,  regional  diseases  are  expanding  to  new  locations,  the  threat  of  bioter-
rorism  looms,  and  a  multitude  of  diseases  have  insufficient  treatments.  New  treat-
ment  paradigms  and  testing  methods  are  desperately  needed.  The  knowledge  from
space flight experiments is providing novel insight into how microbes cause disease
in  the  human  body  and  is  providing  new  targets  for  therapeutic  and  vaccine  devel-
opment.  The  goal  is  to  identify  target  mechanisms  in  space  and  then  investigate
these  mechanisms  on  Earth.  By  understanding  more  fully  how  these  organisms
function  and  react  to  novel  stimuli,  we  can  develop  new  methods  to  treat  and  pre-
vent the spread of infectious agents.

In addition, the knowledge gained from space flight research can advance and ac-
celerate  therapeutic  development  and  implementation  of  new  strategies  for  trans-
lation  of  this  research  into  health  benefits  for  the  developing  world.  The  costs  of
therapeutics  and  vaccine  development  can  be  prohibitively  high.  Bringing  a  new
drug  to  market  can  cost  in  excess  of  one  billion  dollars  over  a  decade  before  it
reaches the patient. If the knowledge gained from space flight studies provides even
an incremental decrease in these costs and timelines (which studies strongly suggest
is the case), then this research is of tremendous importance.

An  example  of  a  potential  boon  from  space  flight  experiments  is  our  laboratory’s
discovery  that  gene  regulatory  proteins  participate  in  the  space  flight  mechanistic
response  of  microbial  pathogens.  Gene  regulatory  proteins  affect  every  property  of
a  cell  including  its  ability  to  cause  disease.  Our  laboratory  is  currently  focusing  on
how  this  regulatory  pathway  works  in  Salmonella  and  how  it  can  be  manipulated
to  control  that  organism’s  virulence  in  flight  and  here  on  Earth.  Once  understood,
we  will  use  that  knowledge  to  see  which  other  microorganisms  can  be  controlled  in
a  similar  fashion.  A  detailed  understanding  of  how  these  gene  regulatory  proteins
are  controlled  may  offer  new  opportunities  to  design  efficacious  drugs  and  vaccines
that would target this class of protein.

It  is  also  relevant  to  note  that  there  are  exciting  efforts  underway  to  develop  a
nationwide  Biotechnology  Space  Research  Alliance  (BSRA)  Consortium  that  part-
ners a world-class team of industry, university, and economic development organiza-
tions  across  the  country  to  partner  with  NASA  to  utilize  the  ISS  for  breakthrough
biomedical and biotechnology discoveries. It is anticipated that the discoveries made
on  ISS  will  engender  scientific  knowledge,  technological  capability,  and  commerce
on Earth as a gateway to 21st Century exploration and development of space.

One  key  to  our  nation’s  economic  success  has  been  its  ability  to  provide  unique
answers  to  the  world’s  problems.  We  have  the  opportunity  to  advance  in  a  field
where  the  United  States  is  a  world  leader.  I  believe  space  exploration  and  develop-
ment  will  be  one  of  the  defining  activities  for  our  nation  that  will  lead  the  world
in this new millennium.

biomechanics, making several fundamental discoveries in these fields. Her research
has contributed important new insight into how mechanical forces like microgravity
and fluid shear affect the function and behavior of living cells, and ultimately, play
an important role in infectious disease. The results of Dr. Nickerson’s NASA-funded
work  have  been  published  in  high-quality,  peer-reviewed  journals,  including  Pro-
ceedings  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  Infection  and  Immunity,  and  Applied
and Environmental Microbiology. She is recognized internationally for her work and
has  won  several  prestigious  awards  including  the  Presidential  Early  Career  Award
for  Scientists  and  Engineers  from  NASA—presented  by  President  George  W.  Bush
at  the  White  House  (2001);  the  Charles  C.  Randall  Award  for  Outstanding  Young
Faculty  Member  from  the  American  Society  for  Microbiology  (2000);  Woman  of  the
Year,  New  Orleans,  LA,  presented  by  New  Orleans  City  Business  (2002);  Out-
standing Newcomb College Alumnae (2004), and selection by NASA as an Astronaut
Candidate  Finalist  (2003).  She  also  serves  as  a  Scientific  Consultant  for  the  NASA
Life  Sciences  Division  at  the  Johnson  Space  Center  in  Houston,  TX.  Experimental
payloads  from  Dr.  Nickerson’s  laboratory  have  flown  on-board  NASA  Space  Shuttle
missions STS–112, STS–115, STS–123, and the International Space Station.

A landmark experiment from Dr. Nickerson’s lab recently flew on Shuttle mission
STS–115,  and  was  the  first  study  to  examine  the  effect  of  space  flight  on  the
virulence (disease-causing potential) of a microbial pathogen, and the first to obtain
the entire gene expression response of a bacterium to space flight. The results from
this experiment were remarkable and showed that during space flight, the bacterial
pathogen  Salmonella  increased  its  virulence  and  altered  its  gene  expression  re-
sponses  in  unique  ways  that  are  not  observed  using  traditional  experimental  ap-
proaches. The results from this work have provided novel insight into the molecular
mechanisms  that  microbial  pathogens  use  to  cause  infectious  disease  both  during
flight and on Earth, and has exciting implications for translation into human health
benefits,  including  the  development  of  new  drugs  and  vaccines  for  treatment  and
prevention.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Dr. Nickerson.
Mr. Pickens.

STATEMENT OF MR. THOMAS BOONE PICKENS, III, CHAIRMAN

AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SPACEHAB, INC.

Mr.  PICKENS.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,
thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  make  my  first  appearance  before
you today as the Chairman and CEO of SPACEHAB to discuss the
significance  of  NASA’s  International  Space  Station  Program,  not
just as it applies to commercial aerospace company, but also for its
tremendous  potential  to  benefit  mankind.  I  represent  the  commer-
cial perspective of microgravity and its value.

First question was how does your company arrive at the decision
to  pursue  vaccine  development  under  microgravity  conditions  and
other  opportunities?  SPACEHAB  has  long  known  the  value  of  the
microgravity  as  our  commercial  modules  and  carriers  have  been
the  primary  payload  on  23  Space  Shuttle  missions  in  both  the
Space Station here and International Space Station. We have flown
over  1,500  experiments  to  space,  and  much  knowledge  was  discov-
ered.

However, after reviewing these experiments I found that we have
only begun the discovery processes. While experiments were sent to
space,  the  ISS  was  under  construction,  and  the  environment  was
not ideal for these sometimes very sensitive samples.

But  today  the  International  Space  Station  is  nearly  complete,
and the ISS has been designated a national laboratory available for
commercial  endeavors,  setting  the  stage  for  a  new  age  in  micro-
gravity  experimentation  that  shows  strong  indications  of  great
value both in commercial investment returns and in saving and en-
hancing our lives here on Earth.

To  take  advantage  of  these  unparalleled  space-based  resources,
SPACEHAB  has  initiated  a  new  division.  SPACEHAB’s  Micro-
gravity  Processing  division  is  uniquely  qualified  to  identify  com-
mercial  microgravity  processing  opportunities  through  our  history
of  supporting  microgravity  research  activities  and  our  wide  range
of partnerships with agencies and industry leaders.

This  division  focuses  on  commercial  R&D  initiatives  that  are
aligned with the national lab capabilities, transportation opportuni-
ties, and market demand.

To  assist  SPACEHAB  in  identifying  these  high-value  opportuni-
ties  for  commercialization,  we  formed  a  team  of  our  nation’s  lead-
ing microgravity researchers. SPACEHAB Science Advisory Council
is comprised of experts in microgravity life sciences, biotechnology,
and  material  sciences,  and  most  of  these  distinguished  individuals
have extensive experience with microgravity.

The first step in this process is to gain access to the ISS through
a Space Act Agreement, and the next step is to establish the appro-
priate  public  and  private  partnerships  required  to  execute  an  ISS
National Lab project.

As an example, SPACEHAB has established a public partnership
with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which will allow joint ef-
forts in various biotechnology research and product development in
the national lab, leading to commercial healthcare solutions.

Second question. Are there other applications of the microgravity
environment  that  you  intend  to  pursue?  And  I  will  go  through
those.  The  space  environment  has  been,  has  shown  to  induce  key
changes in microbial cells to, and are directly relevant to infectious
disease.  The  targets  identified  from  each  of  these  microgravity-in-
duced alterations represents an opportunity to develop new and im-
proved  therapeutics,  including  vaccines,  as  well  as  biological  and
pharmaceutical  agents  aimed  specifically  at  eradicating  the  patho-
gen.  Furthermore,  these  different  targeted  approaches  each  rep-
resent  potential  product  lines  of  development  within  the  micro-
gravity environment.

SPACEHAB has determined that one of the most valuable short-
term  microgravity  opportunities  is  in  the  development  of  advanced
vaccines  that  have  the  potential  to  be  worth  billions  of  dollars
while saving thousands and perhaps millions of lives.

No single medical advance has had a greater historical impact on
human  health  than  vaccines.  Today  vaccines  continue  to  be  devel-
oped,  providing  hope  to  eradicate  many  diseases  that  continue  to
kill  millions  every  year  as  pandemic  influenza,  AIDS,  cancer,  and
instruments of bioterror.

An  experiment  that  flew  in  the  ISS  in  2006,  concluded  that  bac-
teria grown in microgravity are much stronger than those grown on
Earth.  This  is  a  very  important  discovery  as  it  signaled  to  sci-
entists  that  microgravity  properly  controlled  could  be  used  to  de-
sign  vaccines  much  quicker  and  with  much  greater  precision  than
before possible.

As  a  result  of  these  and  other  conclusions,  SPACEHAB  has
taken  these  composite  findings  to  the  next  level  in  sponsoring  a
microgravity vaccine development model that was sent to space on
the  Space  Shuttle  during  mission  STS–123.  The  vaccine  model  is
scheduled to return on the STS–124 mission in May to confirm the

47

initial  results.  Once  complete,  this  new  space-based  model  has  the
potential to significantly increase our ability to develop vaccines for
various types of infectious diseases.

Protein  crystal  growths,  we  call  those  PCGs,  the  cells  of  the
human body are the mini factories that enable life. What divide all
those  factories  to  perform  their  specific  functions  are  the  proteins
that  are  synthesized  within  these  cells.  The  body  utilizes  approxi-
mately  400,000  of  these  proteins,  and  when  certain  protein/cell
functions  become  abnormal,  a  wide  variety  of  diseases  and  condi-
tions may present themselves. Drugs can be developed to alter the
effects of these problem proteins, but drug development is very dif-
ficult  to  accomplish  on  Earth  and  for  some  of  those  more  serious
diseases,  microgravity  is  thought  to  hold  the  only  solution  for  sav-
ing millions of lives on Earth.

Diabetes,  Parkinson’s,  Alzheimer’s,  Cystic  Fibrosis  are  only  just
a few of the diseases the microgravity is thought to hold the poten-
tial to provide significant advancements in developing a drug treat-
ment.

A technique has been developed on Earth to discover drug thera-
pies that involves growing a very pure crystal that is used to obtain
an  image  of  the  atomic  structure  of  a  protein.  Once  the  crystal  is
obtained,  a  very  high  powered  X-ray  or  X-ray  crystallography,
reads the structure of the protein and from this, a drug can be de-
veloped. It was discovered that when crystals were grown in micro-
gravity, the results are often times a larger and better quality crys-
tal  that  can  be  more  easily  and  accurately  characterized,  making
it  more  possible  to  develop  a  drug  treatment  that  can  treat  these
diseases.

The  PCGs  have  flown  more  than  any  other  experiment  with  an
estimated  investment  of  over  $400  million  by  NASA.  SPACEHAB
has identified 1,250 Membrane Proteins and 425 Aqueous Proteins
that are ready for microgravity crystallization. The company expect
to  send  the  first  samples  to  the  ISS  for  processing  in  the  third
quarter  of  2008.  Upon  return  from  space,  these  crystals  will  be  X-
rayed  and  the  data  sold  to  drug  development  companies.  Alter-
natively,  the  company  may  choose  to  add  more  value  to  the  dis-
covery by pursuing its own drug development program.

Since  the  inception  of  the  ISS,  hundreds  of  experiments  have
been  conducted  giving  rise  to  additional  opportunities  to  provide
Earth-based  benefit.  As  NASA’s  mission  priorities  focus  on  explo-
ration  beyond  low-Earth  orbit,  the  designation  of  the  ISS  as  a  na-
tional  lab  enables  non-government  entities  to  partner  with  NASA
to  further  the  benefit  of  space-based  research  and  development.
SPACEHAB  intends  to  conduct  its  national  lab  activities  to  move
technology  forward,  provide  economic  growth,  stimulate  the  minds
of  our  future  engineers  and  scientists,  and  to  ultimately  improve
the quality of life here on Earth.

The  third  question  that  I  had  was  are  the  current,  what  are  the
current perspectives in the financial community with respect to un-
derwriting  R&D  efforts  that  require  the  microgravity  environment
of  space?  We  are  currently  funding  our  micro-G  efforts  with  inter-
nal  cash  and  financial  assistance  from  the  State  of  Florida  and  its
Space  Florida  Authority.  The  fact  that  the  ISS  was  designated  as

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

48

a  national  laboratory  last  year  went  a  long,  long  way  to  produce
a—to putting an environment together to attract capital.

Ultimately,  the  investment  community  needs  to  see  commercial
product  come  back  from  micro-G  in  products  sold,  in  profits  made.
We feel confident that we can attract capital from corporate and in-
stitutional investors as needed to provide an acceptable return.

In closing, I would like to add the International Space Station is
unarguably  the  greatest  achievement  man  has  ever  accomplished.
The ISS is the pyramids of our generations in the aqueducts of our
nation.  The  taxpayers  of  this  country  have  spent  over  $100  billion
in its design and construction, and it is a magnificent achievement
that has included 19 countries in this effort.

I want to take this moment to recognize the engineers, the tech-
nicians, and politicians that have accomplished this great feat, and
I  want  to  close  by  reminding  you  that  this  is  the  time  to  take  ad-
vantage of what we have built.

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I  want  to  ex-

tend my sincere appreciation for having me here today.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Pickens follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THOMAS BOONE PICKENS, III

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to  make  my  first  appearance  before  you  today  as  the  Chairman  and  CEO  of
SPACEHAB,  Inc.  to  discuss  the  significance  of  NASA’s  International  Space  Station
Program—not  just  as  it  applies  to  a  commercial  aerospace  company—but  also  for
its tremendous potential to benefit mankind.

SPACEHAB,  Inc.  (NASDAQ:  SPAB),  was  incorporated  in  1984  and  made  its  ini-
tial  public  offering  in  1995.  The  Company  flew  its  first  module  on  a  Space  Shuttle
mission  in  1993.  To  date,  SPACEHAB  modules  and  carriers,  which  fly  in  NASA’s
Space  Shuttle  cargo  bay,  have  been  the  primary  payload  on  23  Space  Shuttle  mis-
sions,  including  research  missions  on-board  the  fleet  of  orbiters,  resupply  missions
to  both  the  Russian  space  station  Mir,  and  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS).
The modules doubled the amount of working and living space available to the astro-
naut  crews.  Over  the  course  of  our  pressurized  module  program,  SPACEHAB  has
been  involved  in  the  analytical  and  physical  integration  and  operation  of  hundreds
of microgravity research and science payloads.

SPACEHAB  has  long  known  the  value  of  microgravity;  however  there  has  never
been  the  environment  to  commercially  exploit  these  opportunities  as  the  priorities
of the international space partners have been the construction of the ISS while per-
forming rudimentary experiments in microgravity. Additionally, until this year, the
ISS  has  simply  not  been  in  the  state  of  completion  that  would  have  been  able  to
sustain  repeated  processing  of  microgravity  products.  And,  until  the  NASA  Author-
ization Act of 2005, NASA has never considered commercial ventures to profit from
ISS produced products. Now that the International Space Station is nearly complete,
and the ISS has been designated as a National Laboratory available for commercial
endeavors,  the  next  obvious  direction  for  SPACEHAB  is  to  utilize  its  experience  in
microgravity and commercial practices in forming a partnership with NASA to dem-
onstrate the efficacy of the commercial space industry. This goal is achieved by the
enhancement  of  life  on  Earth  through  the  advancement  of  a  wide  range  of  micro-
gravity technologies from a ‘‘demonstrated’’ state to a production state.

To  take  advantage  of  these  unparalleled  space  based  resources  SPACEHAB  has
initiated  a  new  division.  SPACEHAB’s  Microgravity  Processing  division  is  uniquely
qualified  to  identify  commercial  microgravity  processing  opportunities  through  our
history of supporting microgravity research activities and our wide range of partner-
ships  with  agency  and  industry  leaders.  Additionally,  SPACEHAB’s  Microgravity
Processing division is ideally positioned to implement these commercial microgravity
opportunities  through  the  company’s  core  capability  of  planning,  integrating,  oper-
ating payloads and its proven experience in commercial business practices. This di-
vision focuses on commercial R&D activities that are aligned with the National Lab
capabilities, transportation opportunities and market demand.

SPACEHAB’s  Microgravity  Processing  division  serves  to  advance  both  the  busi-
ness  and  technical  state-of-the-art.  With  the  designation  of  the  ISS  as  a  National

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

Lab,  SPACEHAB  is  establishing  a  broad  portfolio  of  commercialization  initiatives
that  will  advance  the  state  of  the  commercial  space  business  sector  to  a  level  only
previously  theorized  by  commercial  space  advocates.  By  migrating  microgravity
processing  initiatives  from  demonstration  and  validation  to  commercial  production
initiatives, substantial progress is made in sample throughput by adding to existing
microgravity  processing  hardware  the  advanced  automation  systems  necessary  for
higher volumes.

To  assist  SPACEHAB  in  identifying  those  high-value  opportunities  for  commer-
cialization, a team of our nation’s leading microgravity researchers has been formed.
This Science Advisory Council, chaired by SPACEHAB’s MGP Program Manager, is
comprised  of  experts  in  microgravity  life  sciences,  biotechnology  and  material
sciences. The majority of the council members are affiliated with educational institu-
tions and will also provide significant guidance and contribution to SPACEHAB-de-
veloped  educational  programs  used  to  motivate  the  next  generation  of  science  and
engineering professionals. Members of this council include:

Once  a  commercial  opportunity  has  been  identified,  SPACEHAB  will  develop  a
unique business plan to ensure the viability of the proposed opportunity. Each busi-
ness  will  utilize  a  systematic  process  to  assure  all  technical  and  financial  aspects
of  each  opportunity  are  aligned  with  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  National  Lab
and have a high probability of success.

The  first  step  in  this  process  is  to  establish  the  appropriate  public  and  private
partnerships  required  to  execute  an  ISS  National  Lab  project.  As  an  example,
SPACEHAB  has  established  a  public  partnership  with  the  Department  of  Veterans
Affairs  which  will  allow  joint  efforts  in  various  biotechnology  research  and  product
development on the National Lab leading to commercial health care solutions. Addi-
tionally,  SPACEHAB  is  establishing  partnerships  with  private  commercial  compa-
nies  to  better  ensure  its  success  for  the  development  of  commercial  products  uti-
lizing the National Lab. SPACEHAB has established a commercial partnership with
Dynamac, the operator of the Space Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL) at the Kennedy
Space  Center  (KSC).  For  37  years,  Dynamac  has  been  providing  advanced  science
research  and  technology  services  related  to  physical,  chemical,  and  life  science  re-
search initiatives. Beginning in 1995, as the prime Life Sciences Services Contractor
(LSSC)  for  NASA–KSC,  Dynamac  scientists  have  helped  process  more  than  180
Shuttle and ISS flight experiments. In addition to supporting Principle Investigators
(PIs) world wide, Dynamac scientists have designed, constructed, and processed over
10  flight  experiments  as  the  primary  PIs.  This  partnership  arrangement  utilizes
their  commercial  ‘‘work-for-others’’  allocation  in  their  SLSL  contract  allowing  them
to  support  industry  initiatives  in  microgravity  research.  Utilization  of  their  skills
and  this  state  of  the  art  facility  accommodates  payload  preparation,  in-flight  data
collection, payload control, and supports post flight sample recovery and evaluation.
The  data  network  system  installed  in  the  SLSL,  and  managed  by  Dynamac,  allows
payload monitoring and control capability to both on-site and at off-site SPACEHAB
facilities.

SPACEHAB  has  developed  a  broad  portfolio  of  opportunities  in  the  biotech  and
material  science  markets.  We  are  working  diligently  to  match  these  opportunities
with flight opportunities and funding profiles. The overall objective is to have a dy-
namic  matrix  that  can  quickly  match  opportunities  with  flight  availability,  market
demand and available resources. Some near-term targets include:

Infectious Disease

The  space  environment  has  been  shown  to  induce  key  changes  in  microbial  cells
that  are  directly  relevant  to  infectious  disease,  including  alterations  of  microbial
growth rates, antibiotic resistance, microbial pathogenicity (that is, the ability of the
organism  to  invade  human  tissue  and  cause  disease),  organism  virulence,  and  ge-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

50

netic changes within the organism. The targets identified from each of these micro-
gravity-induced  alterations  represent  an  opportunity  to  develop  new  and  improved
therapeutics,  including  vaccines,  as  well  as  biological  and  pharmaceutical  agents
aimed  specifically  at  eradicating  the  pathogen.  Furthermore,  these  different  tar-
geted  approaches  each  represent  potential  product  lines  of  development  within  the
microgravity environment.

Understanding  virulence  factors  is  key  to  developing  a  vaccine.  Virulence  refers
to  the  degree  of  pathogenicity  of  a  microbe,  or  in  other  words,  the  relative  ability
of a microbe to cause disease. Virulence factors must be identified, and either puri-
fied for use as a vaccine, or the virulence factor can be deleted from the bacterium,
yielding  an  attenuated  strain  to  use  as  a  vaccine.  Hence,  vaccines  may  consist  of
dead or inactivated organisms, or purified products derived from them. As the devel-
opment  of  antibiotic  resistance  continues  to  erode  one  of  the  greatest  advances  in
modern health care, it is crucial to identify bacterial targets that can form the basis
of novel anti-infective therapies, including vaccines.

SPACEHAB  has  determined  that  one  of  the  most  valuable  short-term  micro-
gravity  opportunities  is  the  development  of  advanced  vaccines  that  have  the  poten-
tial  to  be  worth  billions  of  dollars  and  also  represents  one  of  the  quickest  paths  to
success.

No  single  medical  advance  has  had  a  greater  impact  on  human  health  than  vac-
cines. Before vaccines, Americans could expect that every year measles would infect
four  million  children  and  kill  3,000;  diphtheria  would  kill  15,000  people,  mostly
teenagers;  rubella  (German  measles)  would  cause  20,000  babies  to  be  born  blind,
deaf,  or  mentally  retarded;  pertussis  would  kill  8,000  children,  most  of  whom  were
less  than  one  year  old;  and  polio  would  paralyze  15,000  children  and  kill  1,000.
Smallpox,  a  disease  estimated  to  have  killed  500  million  people,  was  eradicated  by
vaccines. Today, vaccines continue to be developed providing hope to eradicate many
diseases that continue to kill millions every year such as pandemic influenza, staph-
ylococcus, AIDS, instruments of bioterror, and various types of cancers.

The frustration encountered by the biotech vaccine industry lays in the cost of the
discovering  the  exact  strain  of  bacteria  needed  to  invigorate  the  immune  system
while  causing  no  harm  to  the  animal—including  humans.  On  Earth  this  is  a  very
arduous process typically taking many years with a low probability of success. How-
ever,  an  experiment  that  flew  to  the  ISS  in  2006  concluded  that  bacteria  grown  in
microgravity are much stronger than those grown on Earth. This was a very impor-
tant  discovery  as  it  signaled  to  scientists  that  microgravity,  properly  controlled,
could  be  used  to  design  vaccines  much  quicker  and  with  much  greater  precision
than  ever  before  possible.  Many  other  vaccine  experiments  have  since  been  sent
with  similar  findings.  As  a  result,  SPACEHAB  is  taking  these  composite  findings
to the next level and sponsoring a microgravity vaccine development model that was
sent  to  space  on  the  Space  Shuttle  during  mission  STS–123.  The  vaccine  model  is
scheduled  to  return  on  the  STS–124  mission  in  May  to  confirm  the  initial  results.
The  selected  vaccine  that  SPACEHAB  has  chosen  is  to  combat  the  complex  Sal-
monella  bacteria  that  makes  millions  sick  every  year,  kills  thousands,  and  costs
many millions of dollars in financial damages. SPACEHAB has teamed with the De-
partment  of  Veterans  Affairs  in  collaboration  with  investigators  from  the  National
Space Biomedical Research Institute at Baylor College of Medicine, Duke University
Medical  Center,  University  of  Colorado  at  Boulder,  and  the  Max  Planck  Institute
for  Infection  Biology.  Results  of  this  infectious  disease  model  will  be  made  public
in the coming months. Once complete this new space based model has the potential
to significantly increase our ability to develop vaccines for various types of infectious
disease.

Proteins

The  cells  of  the  human  body  are  the  mini  ‘‘factories’’  that  enable  life.  What  drive
all of those factories to perform their specific functions are the proteins that are syn-
thesized  within  those  cells.  The  body  utilizes  approximately  400,000  of  these  pro-
teins  and  when  certain  protein/cell  functions  become  abnormal,  a  wide  variety  of
diseases  and  conditions  may  present  themselves.  Drugs  can  be  developed  to  alter
the  effects  of  these  problem  proteins,  but  drug  development  is  very  difficult  to  ac-
complish  on  Earth  and  for  some  of  the  more  serious  diseases,  microgravity  is
thought to hold the only solution for saving millions of lives on Earth. The following
is  a  list  of  those  diseases  that  microgravity  is  thought  to  hold  the  potential  to  pro-
vide significant advancements in developing a drug treatment:

• Diabetes
• Parkinson’s
• Alzheimer’s

Protein Crystal Growth (PCG)

A technique has been developed on Earth to discover drug therapies that involves
growing a very pure crystal that is used to obtain an image of the atomic structure
of  a  protein.  Once  the  crystal  is  obtained,  a  very  high  powered  x-ray  (x-ray  crys-
tallography)  reads  the  structure  of  the  protein  and  from  this,  a  drug  can  be  devel-
oped. This crystallography technique is routinely performed on Earth however it has
been found that gravity has a limiting effect on the growth and quality of the crys-
tals.  It  was  discovered  that  when  crystals  are  grown  in  microgravity,  the  result  is
often  times  a  larger  and  better  quality  crystal  that  can  be  more  easily  and  accu-
rately  characterized  making  it  more  possible  to  develop  a  drug  treatment  that  can
treat these diseases.

The PCG’s have flown more than any other experiment with an estimated invest-
ment of over $400 million to date. SPACEHAB has identified 1,250 Membrane Pro-
teins and 425 Aqueous Proteins that are ready for microgravity crystallization. The
Company  expects  to  send  the  first  samples  to  the  ISS  for  processing  in  the  third
quarter of 2008. Upon return from space, these crystals will be x-rayed and the data
sold to drug development companies. Alternatively, the Company may choose to add
more value to the discovery by pursuing its own drug development program.

Of  the  human  body’s  approximately  400,000  proteins,  nearly  30%  are  considered
membrane  proteins  and  are,  in  fact,  the  types  of  proteins  involved  in  some  of  the
higher  mortality  diseases  thereby  commanding  significant  governmental  and  cor-
porate research funding. While 30 percent represents well over 100,000 proteins, un-
fortunately  only  about  100  membrane  protein  structures  have  been  identified  due
to  the  extreme  difficulty  of  growing  membrane  protein  crystals  of  sufficient  quality
for  crystallography.  To  show  the  importance  of  membrane  proteins  and  despite  low
number  identified,  nearly  50  percent  of  the  commercially  available  drugs  target
membrane  proteins.  Given  the  improvements  in  crystallography  and  drug  design
over  the  past  10  years,  Vergara,  notes  that  the  ‘‘production  of  well  diffracting  crys-
tals of biological macromolecules remains a major impediment.’’

Previous  space  flight  activities  indicated  that  growing  protein  crystals  in  the
microgravity  environment  experienced  in  spacecraft  offers  significantly  increased
quality  of  protein  crystals.  These  better  diffracting  crystals  create  the  opportunity
to  increase  the  number  of  protein  structures  identified  that  can  be  used  for  new
drug development efforts.

As  SPACEHAB’s  microgravity  processing  initiative  gains  momentum,  our  busi-
ness model is to reinvest in our own future. SPACEHAB will continuously evaluate
past  microgravity  research  and  emerging  discovery  opportunities  to  drive  our  next
generation  microgravity  processing  programs.  This  exploratory  activity  will  be  self-
funded  and  will  set  as  a  goal  the  continued  demonstration  to  the  American  public
the value of the International Space Station.

From improved firefighting equipment derived from NASA’s advances in extra-ve-
hicular  mobility  units  (EMUs)  to  satellite  tracking  of  forest  fires  by  NASA’s  Earth
Observing  System,  the  value  of  NASA’s  research  and  development  activities  has
been manifested countless times here on Earth. Since the inception of the ISS, hun-
dreds of experiments have been conducted giving rise to additional opportunities to
provide  Earth  based  benefit.  As  NASA’s  mission  priorities  focus  on  exploration  be-
yond Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), the designation of the ISS as a National Lab enables
non-government entities to partner with NASA to further the benefit of space based
research  and  development.  SPACEHAB  intends  to  conduct  National  Lab  activities
on  a  broad  portfolio  of  technologies  in  the  life  sciences,  biotechnology  and  material
sciences arenas to move technology forward, provide economic growth, stimulate the
minds of our future engineers and scientists, and to ultimately improve the quality
to  life  here  on  Earth.  The  SPACEHAB  microgravity  processing  effort  directly  bene-
fits the public in multiple ways.

Through the establishment of our microgravity processing division and initial on-
orbit  processing  opportunities,  SPACEHAB  will  raise  significant  capital  and  re-in-
vest this capital in established biotech companies, universities, research centers, as
well  as  our  own  MGP  division  resulting  in  direct  growth  to  local  economies  at  our
sites  in  Texas  and  Florida.  Furthermore,  as  we  incrementally  increase  the  scale  of
our microgravity processing capabilities, we create job opportunities within the aero-
space  industry  in  support  of  the  on-orbit  facilities  (i.e.,  rack  facilities,  etc.)  develop-
ment  and  operations,  the  necessary  ground  infrastructure  to  support  microgravity

processing  preparation  and  flight  operations,  and  non-traditional  jobs  in  support  of
product  post  processing  and  distribution.  We  are  actively  planning  the  creation  of
new  companies  that  are  established  as  a  result  of  the  products  developed  from  our
space  based  processing;  these  new  companies  contribute  positively  to  economic
growth through additional job creation and capital investment.

An  integral  component  of  the  planned  activities  for  utilization  of  ISS  as  a  Na-
tional  Laboratory  is  the  development  of  education  and  outreach  initiatives  for  the
advancement of 6–12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). An
education task force convened by NASA has defined a role for private sector partici-
pation in this important goal, and has extended this objective to also include activi-
ties  ranging  to  university,  graduate  and  post-doctoral  studies.  R&D  activities  in
microgravity  provide  much  opportunity  in  support  of  educational  initiatives.
SPACEHAB  has  a  rich  history  in  this  area,  specifically  in  the  successful  Space
Technology  and  Research  Students  (STARS)  program,  which  provided  hands-on,
interactive  scientific  learning  for  students  from  grammar  through  high  school
aboard the Space Shuttle missions, including STS–107. Students from six countries
participated in the STS–107 mission and were directly involved in the experimental
concept,  design,  management,  set-up  and  data  assessment  of  research  conducted  in
microgravity. More than 40 countries expressed interest in participating during the
development  of  the  STARS  program.  This  activity  partnered  with  BioServe  Space
Technologies, and utilized the Isothermal Containment Module (ICM) for the experi-
mental  studies.  BioServe  has  continued  educational  payload  design—the  Commer-
cial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus Insert–02 (CGB–02) was successfully deployed
on STS–116 and provided data and imagery, via cameras installed within the hard-
ware,  which  were  down-linked  directly  into  classrooms  across  the  world  via  the
World  Wide  Web.  The  CSI–02  is  an  educational  payload  designed  specifically  to
heighten the enthusiasm of students in STEM and to provide opportunities for these
students to participate in near-real time research on ISS. Moreover, these activities
also  raise  national  and  international  awareness  of  cutting  edge  science  and  tech-
nology,  and  opportunities  for  product  development  in  microgravity.  Partnerships  to
utilize  ISS  for  educational  endeavors  can  be  modeled  after  the  STARS  program  for
6–12, with additional outreach to the broader educator community to include teach-
ers  and  scientists  in  both  academia  and  industry,  and  can  be  further  extended  to
educational  program  administrators  for  design  of  next-generation  programs  in
STEM disciplines. The development of training, internship and shadowing programs
designed  to  raise  awareness  of  the  commercial  sector  as  it  pertains  to  microgravity
R&D would also be an important outcome of these educational initiatives.

In conjunction with the establishment of our MGP business unit, SPACEHAB has
undertaken  the  development  of  our  microgravity  processing  technology  roadmap.
With  23  successful  SPACEHAB  missions  containing  numerous  microgravity  pay-
loads,  our  engineers  are  experienced  in  end-to-end  microgravity  payload  processing
including  analytical  integration,  comprehensive  payload  functional  and  interface
testing,  physical  integration,  and  payload  flight  operations.  Leveraging  this  unique
experience  in  the  development  of  our  technology  roadmap,  our  efforts  are  focused
on  innovative  concepts  that  move  the  state-of-the-art  in  microgravity  from  small
scale  locker  processing  to  large  scale  rack  processing  on-orbit,  on  automation  tech-
niques  that  reduce  the  required  on-orbit  crew  time  requirements,  and  to  develop
new techniques for on-orbit data processing where results can be down-linked there-
by reducing the down-mass requirements.

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I  want  to  extend  my  sincere
appreciation  for  allowing  me  this  forum  to  discuss  a  topic  as  critical  to  our  future
as  the  International  Space  Station  Program—as  well  as  your  continued  support
which  is  vital  for  its  success  going  forward.  I  would  be  pleased  to  respond  to  any
questions you may have.

DISCUSSION

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Pickens.
At  this  point  let  us  jump  right  into  our  first  round  of  questions.

The Chair recognizes himself for five minutes.

I  would  like  to  direct  a  question  to  every  member  of  the  panel,
and I would give each one of you about a minute or so to respond.

ISS PRODUCTIVITY AND UTILIZATION

In your opinion what needs to be done to ensure that the ISS will
be a productive research facility, and Dr. Stodieck, I might also ask
you  if  you  would  speak  to  when  you  mentioned  modest  funding,
what that might entail. But we will start with Dr. Knipling.

Dr. KNIPLING. Well, my sense it is already very successful as one
witness,  Mr.  Pickens,  indicated.  It  is  a  tremendous  success.  Cer-
tainly,  yes,  we  garner  the  results  of  some  of  these  initial  experi-
ments. I think that is really going to provide testimony for the op-
portunity,  and  that  in  turn  will  drive  our  future  strategies  for  ex-
panding  and  enhancing  that  work.  That  is  my  sense  of  how  this
work will unfold.

Dr.  STODIECK.  Thank  you.  Modest  funding.  You  know,  it  de-
pends, of course, on ultimately what it is going to cost for transpor-
tation,  and  that  is  a  fairly  uncertain  term  at  this  point,  but  just
doing some estimates based on what I suspect this will get, I would
say  if  you  funded  an  organization  somewhere  between  $50  million
and $150 million, maybe ramping up to that point, that you would
have  a  substantial  ability  to  attract  and  raise  the  productivity  of
the space station, something on that order.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you. Dr. Nickerson.
Dr.  NICKERSON.  From  a  scientific  perspective,  in  order  to  truly
tap into the fundamental and the enormous potential of the ISS as
I  mentioned  in  my  previous  testimony  to  lead  to  global  advances
in human health, two things from my perspective.

Consistent  funding  and  access.  The  consistency  in  that  funding
word  is  very  important,  because  science  doesn’t  stop  after  one  ex-
periment.  Good  science  leads  to  more  questions  than  it  answers,
and so once you find something truly remarkable in flight and that
potential for novel discovery, just as we found in STS–115, we were

54

fortunate enough to have the follow-up flight on STS–123. But that
consistency has to continue.

So consistency for funding and access.
Chairman UDALL. Mr. Pickens.
Mr.  PICKENS.  I  think  that  it  is  a  little  more  complex  from  my
standpoint,  because  I  am  from  the  commercial  side.  I  have  seen
where  they  have  put  experiments  in  space.  They  have  done  kind
of  fits  and  starts  of  it  in  terms  of  funding,  timing,  but  they  are  in
the middle of a construction program, and I kind of, you know, put
the  analogy  is  that  you  are  trying  to  do  open-heart  surgery  on  the
back  of  a  bulldozer  in  the  middle  of  a  construction  site  at  a  sky-
scraper.

You know, they were building a space station in space, and they
were putting and wedging the science in whenever they had the op-
portunity, and that is very, very hard to do science that way. When
you talk to the scientists, they need to have consistency where they
are  bringing  back  samples,  they  are  fixing  them,  they  are  going
back again, over and over and over.

Now  is  the  time,  because  we  have  completed  the  station  or  we
are near completion of the station. Now is the time that we should
get  in  there  and  do  that.  We  should  do  it  exactly  like  Louis  says.
We should fund something. We should remain, if there is somebody
who  is  independent  to  make  sure  that  these  initiatives  are  held
forth,  there  is  $100  billion  asset  up  there.  The  taxpayers  expect  a
return, and they are entitled to a return. And they need to be given
that opportunity and that science needs to be taken care of.

From  a  commercial  standpoint  I  will  take  the  low-hanging  fruit
of  those  efforts,  and  I  will  take,  and  whenever  they  are  discovered
to  a  point  where  they  are  commercial,  and  I  will  move  them  on
through to the marketplace.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  could  follow  on,  what  are  your  next  steps  in

preparing for the utilization of station?

Mr. PICKENS. We are already moving, I mean, STS–123, 124, we
are  headed  out  for  the,  you  know,  duration  of  the  Space  Shuttle
missions.  We  are  concerned  after  that,  because  we  don’t  have  as
easy  access  to  space.  It  is  nearing  the  completion  of  the  manifest
of the Shuttle. It is very, very tight to wedge our way in there. We
are  doing  that  successfully  thus  far,  but  we  are  very  concerned
about it, and we need that desperately because by the time we fin-
ish,  we  need  to  not  have  some  gap  in  there,  not  to  overemphasize
the gap, but we don’t want a gap sitting there on the science either.
We still have to make a return as soon as possible to the American
people  and  by  getting  on  these  Space  Shuttle  flights  and  sending
up  what  we  are  sending  up  that  goes  a  long  way,  and  I  commend
NASA for allowing us to go on the Shuttle to date.

And I hope for more of that.
Chairman  UDALL.  You  are  ready  to  go,  you  have  got  the  capital

lined up, you are confident what you need is——

Mr.  PICKENS.  Yes,  sir.  I  am  sending  samples  to  space  as  we

Judge Hall for five minutes. Look forward to hearing his questions.

And  I  guess  I  will  use  part  of  my  time  in  thanking  this  very  ca-
pable  group  of  witnesses  here.  I  have  really  got  something  from
every  one  of  you.  And  I  thank,  Mr.  Rohrabacher  for  being  here.  I
especially ask him, you can tell by my raspy voice that I have been
a  victim  of  the  influenza,  and  Dr.  Nickerson,  if  you  will  do  some
more work on that, we will all be——

Dr. NICKERSON. I will get right on that.
Mr. HALL. And everybody around me would appreciate it.
I want to say of course I enjoyed Dr. Knipling’s work, and to Dr.
Stodieck, I liked your use of all agency’s cost covered and compari-
sons  with  other  research,  and  NASA  and  Congress  admonished  to
have  access  to  ISS  and  planning  together  and  producing  together.
Very good instructions.

And  Dr.  Nickerson,  our  nation  badly  needs  good  news  from
space,  not  just  tickertape,  something  over  the  television  or  just
huge  appropriations  and  exciting  and  delicate  yes  and  still  fragile
missions.  We  need  studies  of  cures  from  space,  and  you  certainly
reflect your intention is such, and I know I appreciate that and this
group does.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND SPACEHAB

ACTIVITIES

And  to  Tom  Pickens,  accelerating  the  need  for  microgravity  and
the  many  experiments  of  space  and  the  comparisons  were  very
helpful. And your salute to the Space Station by it being at a class
of  all  strategies  is  very,  and  the  suggestion  also  to  be  as  sensible
as possible as they can be with the funds.

And along that line let me ask you, Mr. Pickens, do you see any
distinction  between  the  types  of  activity  SPACEHAB  seeks  to  con-
duct  versus  those  that  would  be  of  interest  to  university  and  gov-
ernment  researchers?  Or  commercial  activities  in  competition  with
other university government research for ISS resources.

I would like to hear your comments on that if we have time left.

I would like to hear each of you.

Mr.  PICKENS.  I  always  look  when  doing  due  diligence  on,  you
know,  opportunities  in  the  marketplace,  I  like  to  see  paradigms
that were successful in the past, and I think a paradigm, you could
take most of them, but let us just take the railroads.

You know, the United States Government built the railroads and
then they proved out the technology and then today, you know, the,
you  know,  all  that  evidence  of  success  is  certainly  there.  We  built
the International Space Station. We have built the access to space.
What  we  haven’t  done  and  what  is  necessary  here  is  that  the  gov-
ernment  is  the  only  one  that  is  going  to  take  these  kind  of  risks,
because  commercial  enterprise  is  not.  They  are  not  going  to  be
sending  up  a  whole  lot  of  real  basic  science  that  we  really  haven’t
gone to the steps necessary in order to discover.

Again,  we  weren’t  given,  the  science  community  was  not  given
and  nor  should  really,  I  mean,  the  amount  of  time  that  they  were
given  was  generous  by  NASA.  They  were  building  a  skyscraper  in
space,  and  to  be  putting  science  in  there  was  generous  of  them  to
do  that.  But  now  we  are  at  the  stage  to  where  we  need  to  go  and
promote  that  and  move  forward  with  it,  and  government  needs  to
go with the university level like Louis suggests and do a lot of basic

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

56

science  work.  When  it  gets  to  the  point  to  where  it  is  commercial,
people  like  me  and  myself,  we  will  see  that.  We  will  identify  that,
and  then  we  will  move  forward  with  how  you  end  up  taking  that
to a commercial setting.

So I think that there is a differentiation between the commercial
interests  and  from  the  more  basic  science  university  interest,  and
I think they should be treated differently as well, sir.

Dr.  NICKERSON.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  answer  that
question.  From  researchers  and  scientific  individuals’  perspective
and  maybe  I  was  fortunate  to  have  been  trained  in  a  very  multi-
disciplinary background which thinks outside of the box, but I have
been  trained,  and  I  have  always  believed  in  a  diversified  research
portfolio  that  is  funded  on  multiple  fronts,  both  by  a  government,
traditional federal funding agencies, but also by corporate and pri-
vate funding as well.

In that capacity, therefore, a lot of times some of your higher-risk
research  which  has  real  tremendous  potential  to  lead  to  major  ad-
vances  in  public  health,  but  it  is  higher  risk,  and  sometimes  some
of  the  traditional  funding  venues  in  terms  of  our  federal  funding
agencies  like  in  NIH,  tend  to  steer  away  from  that  a  little  bit  and
go for a more safer paradigm in terms of funding.

And sometimes those risks don’t pay off, but holy cow, sometimes
they  do.  And  we  have  got  to  make  that  translational  leap  of  not
phenomenology. This isn’t would be, could be, wishing kind of stuff.
This  is  going  to  happen.  It  already  is  happening,  and  it  will  con-
tinue  to  happen.  And  for  us  to  continue  to  maintain  our  nation’s
leap  in  technological  and  biomedical  innovations  to  translate  in
terms  of  these  types  of  advances,  in  terms  of  my  end  of  public
health,  we  have  got  to  be  able  to  successfully  balance  these  types
of  funding  and  get  away  from  them  being  normally  separate  but
merge them together.

So absolutely. All three of those types of funding levels can exist

together nicely and do.

Mr.  HALL.  My  time  is  up,  and  I  hope  Dr.  Stodieck  and  Dr.
Knipling will answer my questions in some other people’s five min-
utes here in a little bit.

But  I  would  say  to  you,  Mr.  Pickens,  that  your  comparison  of
railroads  to  space  really  goes  from  the  bottom  to  the  top,  and  it  is
a  good  comparison.  You  know,  I  vote  for  Amtrak  and  all  that,  and
the  dang  thing  goes  to  New  York  about  35  times  a  day  and  goes
to Philadelphia about 40 times, 38 times a day, but, hell, they don’t
even whistle going through my district a lot of times, but I vote for
railroads  because  we  relied  on  rail  during  national  emergency  and
war  times  and  things  like  that.  Thanks  for  that  good  comparison.

I yield back my time.
Chairman  UDALL.  Everybody  here  understands  why  Judge  Hall
is  known  as  a  statesman,  although  in  some  quarters,  well,  states-
men  are  dead  politicians.  We  are  glad  to  have  a  living  statesman
here among us today, and infrastructure is so important to our——

Mr. HALL. Maybe you will give me another five minutes.
Chairman UDALL. That is going too far.
The Chair recognizes the great Member, the Chairman of the En-
ergy  and  Environment  Subcommittee  from  Texas,  Mr.  Lampson.
He is also known, although there would be others that might want

to wrestle him for the title, as the man from NASA. He looks after
NASA  with  the  passion  and  consistency.  Mr.  Lampson,  five  min-
utes.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  have  to  agree
with some of the words that have been said. This is something that
can  drive  a  great  deal  of  the  enthusiasm  of  this  country  when  we
make  our  commitment  to  it  and  consider  the  return  that  we  are
going to, that we have always gotten from our investment in space
and in science.

I  have  had  a  number  of  conversations  of  late  with  Mr.  Pickens,
and  one  of  the  things  that  has  impressed  me  specifically  that  you
said  was  about  how  we  seem  to  have  gotten  away  from  our  con-
centration  on  science  and  relied  more  on  the  idea  of  if  we  build  a
craft, we can figure out what we do with it. We sort of get the cart
before the horse. Really and truly our use of space should be about
what  we  can  learn  from  it,  what  we  can  get  from  the  science.  And
then  whatever  craft  we  have  to  put  together,  then  so  be  it.  We  go
and do it.

And I know that you have done some specific work, Mr. Pickens,
and  I  will  pick  on  you  because  you  do  have  SPACEHAB,  which  is
in  the  22nd  Congressional  District  of  Texas,  and  we  are  proud  of
the work that you do there and——

Mr. PICKENS. We are proud to be there.
Mr. LAMPSON.—the many employees that you have there. But let
me start with you and ask you to continue your comment that you
made  a  minute  ago  about  due  diligence.  You  have  done  something
I  think  that  is  out  of  the  ordinary  with  regard  to  how  you  looked
at what potential there was for commercial activity.
COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AT THE ISS

Can you discuss that a little bit? What did you do that may have
been  different  in  your  findings  as  related  to  the  potential  for  sci-
entific research at the International Space Station?

Mr.  PICKENS.  As  CEO  of  SPACEHAB,  there,  I  am  in  a  very
unique  situation.  I  am  on  a  platform  where  I  can  access  all  of  the
thousands of people, billions of dollars, research, white papers, sci-
entists,  all  those  people  will  always  end  up  responding  to  me.  I
have access to those people, they are excited about having the dis-
cussion with somebody, especially in the commercial sector, and as
a CEO of SPACEHAB, I think I am the only guy that has the kind
of  access  and  that  kind  of  position  probably  oddly  enough  in  this
country and maybe even in the world.

Most of the other aerospace engineering companies are aerospace
engineering  companies.  SPACEHAB  sent  1,500  experiments  to
space over a 23-year period of time. We had intimate knowledge of
how  to  do  that,  and  I  use  that  platform  and  trained  in  New  York,
I  consider  myself  quite  a  professional  in  due  diligence,  and  I  don’t
stop until I hear glass break as my granddad used to say.

And I just keep going and going and going, and these guys, some
of  them  on  this  panel  right  here,  they  are  sick  of  me,  and  that  is
usually  when  I  start  to  slow  down  is  about  the  time  they  do  get
sick of me.

But  I  have  found  that  there  is  a  lot  of  value  up  there.  There  is
billions  of  dollars  worth  of  value  in  terms  of  commercial  value.  In

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

58

this,  you  know,  environment  that  we  are  in  that  seems  so  appro-
priate where we should also be cognizant as commercial enterprise
leaders  of  commercial  companies,  we  also  need  to  take  care  of
things  like  environment  and  people  and  whatnot.  It  is  just  such  a
great added benefit to also be able to have the opportunity to save
millions of lives with what we see as opportunities in microgravity.
This thing is for real. I think just in summary to you, Congress-
man, is this is for real. This is the real deal, is that there is a huge
amount  of  value  in  microgravity.  It  wasn’t  given  all  the  attention
that  it  was,  that  we  would  have  hoped,  but  we  were,  again,  con-
structing a skyscraper in space.

So  I  think  that,  you  know,  what  needs  to  happen  now  is  that  I
think  Louis  is  very,  is  being  very  conservative  in  terms  of  the
amount  of  investment  that  should  go  up  there.  We  end  up  in  our
barter  arrangement  that  we  ended  up  by  taking  and  transferring
the  Columbus  Module,  which  is  the  ESA  Module,  the  European
Space  Agency  Module,  and  the  Kibox  Module,  with  the  Japanese
Space Agency Module. We get half of their space because we trans-
ported that on our Space Shuttle. That is the deal. It was a barter
agreement.

We  have  so  much  laboratory  space  up  there  it  is  unbelievable.
With ours, with theirs there is lots of space available. I would like
to  see  billions  of  dollars  go  into  the  basic  science  of  this,  and  I
think  that  it  deserves  it,  and  with  aging  of  America  and  with
health being such a big issue right now, there isn’t any excuse not
to. We should fund NASA more. We should give them more money,
and  we  should  put  them  on  that  focus  to  go  get  that  done  and  ex-
ploit that $100 billion asset up there.

UNCERTAINTY PERTAINING TO LONG-TERM RESEARCH

Mr.  LAMPSON.  I  have  got  less  than  a  minute  left,  so  let  me  just
ask whoever would like to start on this question of the panel. What
impact does, I am concerned that we are not going to fully use the
ISS,  especially  after  we  retire  the  Shuttle.  What  impact  does  the
uncertain  status  of  the  ISS  past  2016,  have  on  potential  users
being able to plan long-term research using the Station?

Dr.  NICKERSON.  Well,  I  think  there  are  two  questions  there,  but
first  I  would  focus  on  what  we  can  get  done  before  2016,  which  if
we  get  the  kind  of  appropriations  and  funding  in  here  we  need  to,
we  can  learn  an  enormous  amount  up  until  that  point  in  time.  So
let  us  not  underestimate  the  tremendous  impact  that  that  can
make up until then.

After  that  point  in  time  it  is  going  to  depend  on  access  and  ac-
cess to space through other venues and how we can continue to use
the  microgravity  environment  after  that.  But  up  to  that  point  in
time  I  am  more  focused  on  what  we  can  do  on  a  consistent  basis
to  maximize  that  space  and  utilize  our  potential  to  lead  to  these
new technology advances.

Mr. LAMPSON. If it, Mr. Chairman, can anyone else comment be-

fore I yield my time back?

Dr. STODIECK. And I just want to add that I think, you know, in
fact,  that  2016,  is  frankly  much  too  close  a  horizon  for  us  to  be
planning  it.  It  seems  ridiculous  to  even  be  thinking  about  the  de-
commissioning of Space Station before it has even been completed.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

59

But  in  reality,  of  course,  that  is  what  you  are  really  asking,  and
I  think  that  we  need  to  already  begin  the  planning,  and  I  think,
of  course,  appropriations  looks  at,  you  know,  five-year  timeframes.
It is not too soon to really be thinking about extending the service
life  of  the  Space  Station,  and  I  think  we  need  to  go  out  to  at  least
2020, and frankly, I think, you know, when we start to get the kind
of  productivity  and  the  results  that  I  expect  to  see,  then  I  think
there will be a lot of interest and extended beyond that.

But I think we need to recognize that without the Space Shuttle
that the, you know, the clock really starts ticking for Space Station
because  it  will  become  more  and  more  difficult  to  maintain  it  and
service  it.  So  starting  that  productivity  as  soon  as  possible  and
using it for as long as we can.

Mr. LAMPSON. Thanks. Dr. Knipling, anything?
Dr.  KNIPLING.  I  believe  my  comments  will  reinforce  what  has
been  said.  I  think  much  can  be  accomplished  in  the  near  term  to
validate these concepts that we have talked about. And we are very
confident that they will be validated one way or the other. We can
adapt to what we learned, but I think that the promise of what we
learn  will  actually  provide  testimony  for  further  extension  in  the
further of the Space Station in one way or another.

Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you all. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman UDALL. Thank the gentleman.
The  Chair  recognizes  the  gentleman  from  California,  Mr.  Rohr-
abacher,  who  is  one  of  the  most  dedicated  and  consistent  sup-
porters  of  this,  and  he  always  has  his  back  peering  over  the  hori-
zon  and  bringing  some  really  creative  thinking  to  NASA  and  how
we  promote  our  space  program  both  in  the  private  and  public  sec-
tors.

Mr. Rohrabacher.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Thank  you.  Let  me  note  that  I  have  sup-
ported  Space  Station.  I  see  the  Space  Station  as  a  success  in  the
sense  that  we  have  learned  how  to  build  structures  in  space.  Hu-
mankind is to advance, if we are going to conquer this frontier, we
have  learned  how  to  cooperate  with  other  countries  in  achieving
that.

I  am  not  sure  even  from  the  testimony  today,  however,  that  the
accomplishments  that  are  being  talked  about  have  been  accom-
plished  in  terms  of  medical  research.  All  along  we  were  told  that
there  would  be  these  great  accomplishments.  It  has  been  a  long
time.

Frankly,  they  have  not  been  validated  yet.  I  have  heard  a  lot  of
rhetoric  today,  but  I  have  been  listening  to  that  rhetoric  for  20
years.  I  am  satisfied  with  the  fact  that  we  now  have  the  capabili-
ties  of  building  structures  in  space.  I  would  hope  they  are  not  just
pyramids.  I  hope  this  isn’t  just  a  pyramid  that  will  be  historic,  a
historic  structure.  I  hope  that  there  is  something  that  comes  out
of it in terms of a cure for a disease. Believe me, I have been listen-
ing to that for 10 years. I haven’t seen it yet.
ISS LAB COMPATABILITY

Your  comment,  Mr.  Pickens,  about  that  there  is  plenty  of  lab
space up there and value to be made from that. I appreciated that.
Are  these,  is  the  research  facility  that  is  in  the  Space  Station,  the

various  labs  that  you  have  talked  about,  are  they  outfitted  for  the
type  of  research  that  is  necessary  to  validate  the  things  that  we
have heard today?

Mr.  PICKENS.  The  way  they  have  it  set  up  is  is  that  other  than
the  fact  that  the  Columbus  Module  has  an  X-ray  crystallography
machine that they have sent up with that so you don’t, you can ac-
tually  do  the  defracture  from  the  crystals  off  the  protein  crystal
growth  from  that  piece  of  equipment.  Basically  what  they  did  is
they  set  up  these  things  that  they  call  express  racks,  which  are
really  data  feeds,  power  feeds.  They  are  just  set  up  for  you,  and
what they do is they take it out of whatever the visiting, you know,
vehicle  is,  and  then  they  put  it  in,  and  they  slide  it  in  there,  and
they  flip  on  a  button,  and  then  from  that  they  control  everything
from the ground operations.

And,  yes,  it  is  all  there.  I  mean,  they  put  that  very  modularly

in place, and they have done that. So, yes.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Is  that  the  same  answer  I  am  getting  from

the other panelists, too? Is—are these labs properly outfitted?

Dr.  Nickerson,  you  have  been  very  optimistic  about  these  great
achievements  that  are  about  to  happen.  Are  we  outfitted  up  there
to make sure that we can actually achieve those things?

Dr.  NICKERSON.  There  were,  of  course,  a  number  of  cuts  that
were made to important research infrastructure that was supposed
to  be  installed  on  ISS,  the  centrifuge,  things  like  that.  It  would  be
very nice if those things could be up there.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Could  you  give  me  a  couple  of  examples  of

Dr. NICKERSON. In terms of how they could be used?
Mr. ROHRABACHER. No. In terms of what needs to be replaced so

we can start thinking about financing it.

Dr. NICKERSON. So it would be nice to have the centrifuge facility

that?

up there.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. A what now?
Dr. NICKERSON. Centrifuge.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Centrifuge. Okay.
Dr. NICKERSON. It would be nice to have some very nice imaging
capabilities on-board in terms of abilities to image very small cells
like  microscopic  imaging.  It  would  be  very  nice  to  have  that  up
there  so  we  can  see  in  real  time  exactly  how  these  cells  are  mani-
festing their changes.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Are there any plans to put microscopic imag-

ing, I know about the centrifuge.

Dr.  NICKERSON.  There  were,  but  those  plans  were  scrapped,  and
it  was  being,  those  plans  were  in  place,  but  I  know  those  funds
were  cut.  For  a  long  time  I  know  with  the  MELFI  there  was  a
question,  and  we  need  to  be  able  to  have  for  long-term  work  on
ISS,  you  know,  capabilities  to  store  at  minus  80,  and  I  know  after
much time the MELFI, I think, is finally fully operational up there
in terms of the freezer capabilities.

But  when  we  are  going  to  be  on  terms  of  long-term  research  on
ISS, we need those kinds of capabilities, some samples we want to
store,  some  we  want  to  keep  viable.  And  when  we  store  them,  we
need  to  make  sure  that  they  are  stored  viably,  and  their  integrity
is preserved.

61

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay.  So  we  need  storage  and  something  to
do microscopic imaging, and I know that the centrifuge debate was
a big debate early on.

Dr. NICKERSON. Right.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  And  an  imager,  it  is  not  just  a  small

investment——

Dr. NICKERSON. Right.
Mr. ROHRABACHER.—there. It is huge. But——
Dr.  NICKERSON.  That  is  one  reason,  though,  that  leads  to,  and
your  question  was  well  founded,  is  that  you  have  heard  about  this
rhetoric  for  a  long  period  of  time.  It  is  going  to  lead  to  these  ad-
vances, it is going to lead to these advances, but in all honesty, the
reason  you  haven’t  seen  that  is  some  of  those  capabilities  are  now
being  able  to  be  put  in  place  and  be  done.  And  with  our  study  it
was  a  biological  first.  It  was  the  first  time  that  space  flight  had
ever been looked at as ability to affect disease-causing potential. It
was  the  first  time  that  a  pathogen  had  ever  been  looked  at  in
terms of a complete molecular global profiling and look at changing
its virulence.

So those kinds of things, you know, until you can translate that,
and we just, by the way, repeated that so we do have biological val-
idation on the STS–123.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Oh. As I say, I think we learned a lot on how

to build structures.

Dr. NICKERSON. Right.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. I think that in and of itself is for humankind

and how to cooperate internationally——

Dr.  NICKERSON.  But  to  have  those  additional  capabilities  would

be helpful.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  That  is  good.  But  I  would  sure  hope  that  we
see  some  of  the  things  that  you  have  been  talking  about.  I  have
heard this before, and I hope it is validated like we say, and if we,
Mr.  Chairman,  if  we  need  a  couple  of  things  to  add  to  the  Space
Station to see that it actually accomplishes the $100 billion that we
have spent, if we are talking about tens of millions of dollars to get
some of these things up there—thank you very much.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  thank  the  gentleman  from  California  for  his

insightful questions and commentary.

Unfortunately,  we  need  to  move  to  the  second  panel.  I  know  ev-
erybody  on  the  dais  here  could  spend  another  hour  directing  ques-
tions to the panel, and we hope to bring you back. We also will di-
rect some additional questions to you all for the record.

I  did  want  to  take  an  additional  moment,  Dr.  Nickerson  had
mentioned  that  in  the  town  of  Alamosa,  which  is  in  the  St.  Louis
valley,  South  Central  portion  of  our  state,  important  agricultural
area.  It  is  also  an  area  in  which  we  are  planning  to  develop  a  lot
of  alternative  energy  technologies.  They  had  to  shut  down  their
water  supply  system  recently.  You  may  have  read  the  story.  It
made  the  national  news  because  of  Salmonella  somehow  infil-
trating the system, and it, over 300 people were taken ill in a town
of about 15,000 people.

So your work is an area in which there may be real applicability.
So I look forward to watching and learning from what you discover
about Salmonella.

Dr. NICKERSON. Thank you. I look forward to giving you updates.
Chairman  UDALL.  At  this  time  we  will  excuse  the  panel.  Again,
thank  you  for  being  here  and  providing  us  with  such  informative
testimony.

We  will  ask  the  second  panel  to  take  their  seats  as  quickly  as

we can, and we will move to the second round.

Let us move to our second panel of witnesses. I would like to in-

troduce each of them in turn.

Dr. William Gerstenmaier, who is the Associate Administrator of
the  Space  Operations  Mission  Directorate  at  NASA.  Next  to  Mr.
Gerstenmaier  is  Cristina  Chaplain,  who  has  been  a  visitor  to  our
committee  before,  and  she  is  the  Director  of  Acquisition  and
Sourcing  Management  at  the  GAO,  has  a  great  rooting  in  NASA
and many aspects of the NASA world. And then finally we have Dr.
Jeffrey  Sutton,  who  is  the  President  and  Director  of  the  National
Space  Biomedical  Research  Institute.  Welcome  to  the  three  of  you.
As  you  know,  our  spoken  testimony  is  limited  to  five  minutes,
after  which  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  will  have  five  minutes
each to ask questions.

We  will  start  with  Mr.  Gerstenmaier  and  his  five  minutes.  Wel-

come.

Panel 2:

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  WILLIAM  H.  GERSTENMAIER,  ASSOCIATE
ADMINISTRATOR  FOR  SPACE  OPERATIONS,  NATIONAL  AER-
ONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA)
Mr. GERSTENMAIER. Thank you. I have addressed your questions
specifically  in  my  written  testimony,  and  I  won’t  spend  much  time
with my verbal discussion.

I  would  just  say  there  is  a  couple  of  areas  I  think  are  really  im-
portant  to  stress  here,  and  first  of  all,  they  were  discussed  earlier
a  little  bit.  The  international  achievement  of  the  Space  Station  is
really unprecedented in my mind. The fact that we are actually op-
erating  internationally  today  with  the  laboratories  on-board  Space
Station  is  a  huge  testimony  to  this  team  that  has  worked  inter-
nationally  to  continue  to  build  Space  Station  and  has  guided  it  to
this point.

And we have also done a lot of engineering evaluations and tests
and evaluation of Space Station. It fits well as we move into explo-
ration of the components, the hardware, the systems, the engineer-
ing  analysis  that  we  are  working  and  developing  on  Space  Station
today  that  we  used  to  assemble  it.  Those  are  directly  applicable  to
what we are going to be doing as we go to the Moon and Mars, run-
ning  pumps  for  long  time,  doing  fluid  circulation,  operating  com-
puters,  working  internationally,  all  those  things  have  direct  appli-
cation to what we are going to do as we go, move beyond low-Earth
orbit  and  move  to  the  Moon  and  Mars.  And  that  is  a  first  step  in
the engineering sense.

I  would  also  say  Space  Station  provides  a  commercial  oppor-
tunity  as  Mr.  Pickens  talked  about  a  little  bit  earlier.  It  clearly
does  for  transportation.  As  we  look  to  transportation  in  the  future
as the Shuttle retires, we are looking to commercial transportation
for  Space  Station.  We  have  recently  put  out  a  request  for  a  pro-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

63

posal  to  commercial  industry  to  provide  transportation  for  Space
Station.  We  think  that  provides  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  the
commercial sector to step up and provide transportation of the ma-
terials needed for the research, for the investigations, as well as for
the basic supplies of Space Station.

We recently had the Automated Transfer Vehicle from the Euro-
pean Space Agency dock to Space Station. That shows that we are
able to do the rendezvous docking. We are able to take a brand new
spacecraft,  take  it  through  developmental  test  program,  and  actu-
ally  dock  it  to  Space  Station  so  that  gives  credibility  and  shows
proof  to  the  commercial  sector  that  this  can  be  done  and  is  very
achievable and they are ready to move forward.

We  have  also  looked  at  a  new  thing,  a  new  way  of  acquiring
hardware  on  Space  Station.  We  are  using  a  Sabatier  reaction,
which  takes  waste  carbon  dioxide  and  waste  hydrogen,  combines
those,  makes  water,  and  generates  methane  that  gets  dumped
overboard. We will save about 2,000 pounds of water with that sys-
tem.  We  acquired  that  commercially  for  the  first  time.  We  didn’t
pay  the  typical  development  way  we  do.  It  is  not  a  cost-plus  con-
tract.  It  is  a  fixed-price  contract,  and  we  get  paid  for  the  water  or
the  contractor  gets  paid  for  the  water  that  is  generated.  So  they
take  the  risk,  and  NASA  is  not  involved  in  the  development.  We
are not attending their design reviews. They show us the hardware
is  safe  to  fly  in  orbit.  If  it  generates  water,  they  receive  revenue
from  that.  If  it  doesn’t  generate  water,  they  have  lost  their  invest-
ment. So it is a new creative way of utilizing the commercial sector
to  provide  services  that  we  need.  And  that  is  another  evidence  of
what the Station can do.

And  lastly,  the  previous  panel  talked  a  lot  about  the  research
avenues.  There  was  a  lot  of  discussion  on  the  biological  aspects.  I
think  there  is  a  lot  of  other  areas  of  Space  Station  that  can  be
used.  There  is  a  combustion  research  rack  that  is  going  up,  there
is  material  science  activities,  there  is  fluid  physics,  and  low  tem-
perature physics.

The  unique  thing  about  Space  Station  is  it  gives  us  a  different
lens  to  look  at  all  these  phenomena,  be  it  biological,  physical,  or
materials processes. It gives us a chance to learn about things that
we  experience  here  on  the  Earth  in  a  different  way.  Some  of  the
Apollo  astronauts  talked  about  that  we  went  to  the  Moon  to  learn
about  the  Earth.  I  think  in  the  same  sense  we  are  going  to  Space
Station  and  with  the  different  lens  of  microgravity,  we  are  going
to  learn  more  about  processes  on  the  Earth  and  directly  impact
what is going on in the very physical sense.

International Space Station—Experience in Exploration

The  Space  Station  is  a  place  to  learn  how  to  live  and  work  in  space,  which  we
need to do, and over a long period of time. It is also a place to conduct the research
we  would  like  to  do  in  a  better  way  than  was  possible  in  the  more  confined  places
we have flown in before.

Through  the  years  of  ISS  design,  development,  test,  assembly  and  operations,
NASA  has  acquired  the  experience  necessary  for  operating  complex,  multinational
space  vehicles.  In  areas  ranging  from  international  collaboration  to  research  and
technology  development,  crew  operations,  spacecraft  system  operations,  and  crew-
system interfaces, the knowledge gained from the ISS can be applied directly to fu-
ture long-duration exploration missions.

International Collaboration

Since  1988,  the  ISS  international  partnership  has  established  an  unprecedented
level  of  global  cooperation  among  the  U.S.,  Canada,  Europe,  and  Japan,  and  in
1998,  Russia  formally  joined  in  this  worldwide  endeavor.  During  the  17  Expedition
missions to date, for nine and a half years on-orbit, and over seven years of contin-
uous human presence, we have together assembled a research facility designed and
produced  around  the  world  that  now  resides  some  250  miles  above  the  Earth.  It  is
the largest spacecraft ever built; it will be 925,627 pounds at completion and meas-
ure  361  feet  end-to-end.  It  is  the  length  of  a  football  field  with  pressurized  volume
greater than a five-bedroom house. By 2010, the international partnership will have
managed  over  80  assembly  and  logistics  missions  (including  26  Space  Shuttle  mis-
sions  to  date  through  STS–123),  with  crew  rotations  and  cargo  transfer  flights  on
five  different  vehicles  that  will  have  included  over  50  crew  members  from  around
the  globe.  Over  650  hours  of  assembly  and  maintenance  activity  have  been  per-
formed  during  extra-vehicular  activity  outside  the  ISS.  Today,  the  ISS  is  approxi-
mately 70 percent complete and has a mass of 261 metric tons.

The  technical  challenges  of  assembly,  operations,  and  logistical  re-supply  have
been  met  through  the  coordination  of  more  than  100,000  workers  in  the  U.S.,  Can-
ada, Europe, Japan, and Russia, including numerous contractor facilities in the U.S.
and over a dozen other countries. The globally distributed control centers supporting
ISS  operations  will  ultimately  coordinate  daily  operations  among  Russia,  Germany,
France, Japan, Canada, and three locations in the United States—Alabama, Florida,
and Texas. In addition, Kazakhstan and French Guiana support launch and landing
operations. The structural, electrical power, thermal control, data and voice commu-
nications, and environmental and life support systems have been designed and pro-
duced  across  international  boundaries.  We  continually  monitor  ongoing  challenges
to safe and successful systems inter-operability due to different industry and safety
standards; varying life cycle development philosophies; the need for common stand-
ards  during  development;  conversions  between  English  versus  metric  units  for  pro-
duction  tooling;  development  of  common  terminology;  unique  engineering  and  man-
agement practices; export control constraints; and cultural and language differences.
The  ISS  international  partnership  has  risen  to  all  challenges  thus  far  and  forged
the strong, positive relationships necessary for the next great steps in human space
exploration.

Research and Technology Development

The  ISS  is  NASA’s  only  long-duration  flight  analog  for  future  human  lunar  mis-
sions and Mars transit. It provides an invaluable laboratory for research with direct
application  to  the  exploration  requirements  that  address  human  risks  associated
with  missions  to  the  Moon  and  beyond.  It  is  the  only  space-based  multinational  re-
search  and  technology  testbed  available  to  identify  and  quantify  risks  to  human
health  and  performance,  identify  and  validate  potential  risk  mitigation  techniques,
and develop countermeasures for future human exploration.

The ISS research portfolio includes human research and countermeasure develop-
ment  for  exploration.  The  ISS  crew  is  conducting  human  medical  research  to  de-
velop knowledge in the areas of clinical medicine, human physiology, cardiovascular
research, bone and muscle health, neurovestibular medicine, diagnostic instruments
and  sensors,  advanced  ultrasound,  exercise  and  pharmacological  countermeasures,
food  and  nutrition,  immunology  and  infection,  exercise  systems,  and  human  behav-
ior and performance.

The  ISS  also  provides  a  testbed  for  studying,  developing,  and  testing  new  tech-
nologies for use in future exploration missions, including advanced life support sys-
tems,  environmental  monitoring,  energy  storage  batteries,  strain  gauges  on  the
truss structure to measure structural loads, light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, ma-
terials  exposure  experiments,  cabin  air  monitoring  and  environmental  monitoring,

robotic  construction  systems,  and  photographic  inspections  surveys  of  external  sur-
faces and components. In the physical and biological sciences arena, the ISS is using
microgravity  conditions  to  understand  the  effect  of  the  space  environment  on  the
physical  processes  of  fluid  physics,  combustion  and  materials  research,  as  well  as
environmental  control  and  fire  safety.  Finally,  the  Station  is  an  ideal  platform  for
observing  the  Earth  and  performing  educational  activities,  including  activities  and
investigations which allow students and the public to connect with the ISS mission
and inspire students to excel in science, technology, engineering, and math.

Crew Operations

High performing crews are critical to successful long-duration missions. The devel-
opment of specialized skills and training for international crew members, as well as
advanced protocols, procedures, and tools, will reduce the risks to future exploration
missions.  Maintaining  crew  health  will  be  critical  to  long-duration  flights,  and  the
ISS provides a demonstration platform through the continuous operation of life sup-
port and medical systems. While much has been learned about crew health systems,
crew medical care, environmental monitoring, and exercise systems critical to main-
taining  crew  fitness,  more  must  be  learned  before  we  undertake  long-duration  mis-
sions  to  the  Moon  or  to  Mars.  Next  Spring,  we  will  have  on-board  the  ISS  all  of
the  life  support,  habitability  and  crew  health  maintenance  hardware  (water/urine
processing,  treadmill,  galley,  toilet,  crew  quarters,  backup  carbon  dioxide  removal)
required to support six-crew operations—a continuous human presence in space that
exceeds all prior human space flight programs.

Effective on-board training is another key to future long-duration exploration mis-
sions.  The  ISS  provides  a  platform  to  develop  efficient  methods  for  conveying  new
information  to  crew  members  and  influence  the  volume  and  types  of  preflight  crew
training.  Computer-based  training  can  be  utilized  to  supplement  ground  training
and provide refresher training for the on-orbit crew.

Exploration missions will also require advances in Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA)
suits,  technologies,  capabilities  and  procedures.  To  date,  Station  and  Shuttle  crews
have  performed  109  U.S.  and  Russian  assembly  and  maintenance  EVAs,  totaling
more  than  650  hours.  Our  evolving  EVA  procedures  enable  us  to  set  the  standard
for in-space assembly, repair, and maintenance.

The  interaction  of  the  crew  with  Mission  Control  is  another  element  critical  to
mission  success.  The  ISS  provides  an  environment  to  improve  the  interaction  be-
tween crew and ground to make missions safer and more effective through planning
and communication. The evolving operations protocols and support tools are increas-
ing crew autonomy and reducing ground support infrastructure. The coordination of
the  Station  support  facilities  is  all  the  more  remarkable  because  the  launch,  oper-
ations,  training,  engineering,  and  development  facilities  are  dispersed  around  the
globe.

Spacecraft Systems Operations

The  ISS  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  flight  test  components  and  systems  in
the  space  environment  and  to  optimize  subsystem  performance.  Station  is  the  only
space-based  testbed  available  for  critical  exploration  spacecraft  systems  such  as
closed-loop  life  support,  EVA  suit  components  and  assemblies,  advanced  batteries
and  energy  storage,  and  automated  rendezvous  and  docking.  Efficient,  reliable
spacecraft  systems  are  critical  to  reducing  crew  and  mission  risks.  Characterizing
and  optimizing  system  performance  in  space  reduces  mission  risks  and  yields  next-
generation capabilities for long distance and autonomous vehicle and systems man-
agement.

As  a  direct  result  of  the  ISS  Program,  the  inventory  of  space-qualified  materials,
piece-parts, components, assemblies, subsystems, and systems has expanded rapidly
to serve future exploration needs. These include:

trolysis for oxygen generation and carbon dioxide removal.

multi-layer insulation, heat exchangers, strip heaters and radiators.

• The  thermal  control  systems  include  heat  rejection  and  management  using

• Station  communication  and  tracking  systems  use  S  Band,  Ku  Band,  UHF,

global positioning satellite system (GPS), and Russian capabilities.

• The robotics capabilities include a seven-degree-of-freedom robot arm.
• The  EVA  systems  include  U.S.  and  Russian  airlocks  and  suits,  tools,  trans-

lation aids, and training facilities.

Demonstrating  and  developing  confidence  in  systems  for  water  and  waste  recov-
ery,  oxygen  generation,  and  environmental  monitoring  technologies  is  important  as
the  distance  and  time  away  from  Earth  is  extended.  U.S.  and  Russian  life  support
systems  represent  dissimilar  yet  redundant  capabilities  for  carbon  dioxide  removal,
oxygen  generation,  and  waste  management.  The  ISS  is  currently  recycling  approxi-
mately  14  pounds  of  crew-expelled  air  each  day  and  using  the  processed  water  for
technical  and  drinking  purposes.  The  ISS  is  well  on  the  way  to  demonstrating
closed-loop  life  support  for  oxygen  generation  and  water  recovery  systems  following
the oxygen generation system activation in July 2007, in conjunction with the water
recovery  system  demonstration  targeted  for  October  2009.  In  2010,  the  ISS  plans
to incorporate a Sabatier system that will combine carbon dioxide and excess hydro-
gen  from  the  oxygen  generation  system  to  produce  water  for  the  generation  of  oxy-
gen.  When  the  closed-loop  life  support  system  is  operational,  it  will  reduce  the
amount  of  consumables  needed  by  about  80  percent.  This  demonstration  is  critical
for future exploration missions.

To generate power, the ISS has the largest solar arrays ever deployed on a space-
craft. Understanding how these arrays and other power system components perform
is  important  to  moving  toward  longer  stays  on  the  Moon  and  transiting  to  Mars.
The  solar  arrays  cover  an  area  of  27,000  square  feet  (an  acre  of  solar  panels,  and
arrays  with  240-foot  wingspans)  and  are  generating  approximately  76  kW  of  elec-
trical power, or 708,000 kW hours per year—enough to power 50 homes. Forty-eight
nickel  hydrogen  rechargeable  batteries  are  used  for  energy  storage,  and  gimbal
mechanisms  allow  solar  tracking  and  thermal  radiators  to  maintain  battery  tem-
perature.  The  operating  experience  being  accrued  on  the  ISS  in  solar  arrays,  me-
chanical  gimbal,  and  rotary  joint  technologies  will  be  directly  applicable  to  future
power systems in space.

Crew-System Interfaces

Demonstration  and  validation  of  the  human-machine  interfaces  enable  sustained
spacecraft  operations  over  long  periods  of  time.  Advances  in  crew  and  robotic  oper-
ations,  on-orbit  maintenance  and  repair,  in-space  assembly,  and  demonstrations  of
new  crew  and  cargo  transportation  vehicles  are  essential  to  expand  human  activity
beyond  low-Earth  orbit.  Many  of  the  techniques  used  to  assemble  hundreds  of  ISS
components  in  space  are  applicable  to  the  assembly  of  components  on  the  Moon,  or
at other locations in space.

Assembling six major truss segments, eight solar array wings, and four laboratory
modules  with  interconnecting  nodes  demonstrates  the  precision  and  coordination
necessary  for  in-space  assembly  of  large  structures.  Autonomous  rendezvous  and
docking  capabilities,  essential  to  complex  future  space  missions,  are  demonstrated
routinely  in  the  global  evolution  of  launch  vehicles  that  transport  crew  and  cargo
to  ISS.  These  vehicles  currently  include  the  Space  Shuttle,  Russian  Soyuz  and
Progress  spacecraft,  and  the  new  European  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  (ATV).  In
the future, other transportation systems currently in development will also support
the ISS. They will include the Japanese H–II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), U.S. Commer-
cial  Orbital  Transportation  Services  (COTS),  and  the  U.S.  Orion  Crew  Exploration
Vehicle.

The  ISS  robotic  arms  provide  the  ability  to  assemble  large  elements  in  flight,
while  ground  control  of  certain  robotic  activities  enables  the  more  efficient  use  of
valuable  crew  time.  The  Station’s  55-foot-long  robotic  arm  can  move  220,000  lbs.—
the  mass  of  the  Space  Shuttle.  Canadian,  Japanese,  and  European  robotic  arms
work  on  different  portions  of  the  ISS  and  can  be  commanded  via  the  ground  or  by
the  crew  on-orbit.  These  multi-national  robotic  operations  are  carefully
choreographed between the ISS crew and the global operations teams.

Development of displays and controls is important for future spacecraft system de-
signs.  Software  tools  play  a  role  in  helping  crews  virtually  practice  EVA  or  robotic
tasks  before  they  ever  don  spacesuits  or  power  up  the  robotic  arms.  The  ISS  has
more  than  50  computers  to  control  on-board  systems,  and  uses  some  2.5  million
lines  of  ground  software  code  to  support  1.5  million  lines  of  flight  software  code.
Standardized  communication  protocols  control  crew  displays  and  software  tools,
while  common  and  standardized  flight  software  products,  tools,  interfaces,  and  pro-
tocols enhance operational practices.

ISS provides a real-world laboratory for logistics management and in-flight main-
tenance and repair concepts for future spacecraft. These techniques demonstrate an
ability  to  evolve  and  adapt  through  daily  operations.  We  have  designed  and  imple-
mented systems to manage limited re-supply capabilities, stowage, and consumables
for long exploration journeys. Common component designs simplify sparing systems
and  are  used  to  minimize  the  number  of  spares  to  be  stored  on-orbit  (e.g.,  common
valve  design).  Our  inter-operable  hardware  systems  include  the  common  berthing
mechanism,  utility  operations  panel,  international-standard  payload  racks,  common
equipment  and  orbital  replacement  units,  crew  equipment,  and  robotic  grapple  fix-
tures.

Through thousands of days of operating experience, the ISS is demonstrating the
maintainability and reliability of hardware components. Models used to predict this
reliability  and  maintainability  are  enhanced  by  measuring  the  mean-time-between-
failure  performance  on  hundreds  of  components,  including  pumps,  valves,  sensors,
actuators, solar arrays, and ammonia loops.

ISS  crews  have  had  to  demonstrate  repair  capabilities  on  internal  systems  and
external  systems  and  components,  as  well  as  hardware  not  originally  designed  for
on-orbit  repair.  The  on-orbit  crews  have  repaired  malfunctioning  space  suits  and
Russian  computers;  replaced  CMGs,  treadmill  bearings,  Russian  Elektron  oxygen
generator  and  Vozdukh  carbon  dioxide  removal  system  subassemblies,  solar  array
system  components,  beta  gimbal  assemblies  (BGAs),  and  remote  power  control
mechanism  (RPCM)  circuit  breakers.  The  Expedition  crews  and  their  ground  main-
tenance  counterparts  have  devised  unique  solutions  that  have  kept  the  ISS  func-
tioning, including remote maintenance and sustainability procedures, and inspection
and  repair  techniques.  This  experience  has  helped  identify  design  flaws  and  re-de-
ploy systems and hardware to orbit.

The  ISS  provides  valuable  lessons  for  current  and  future  engineers  and  man-
agers—real-world  examples  of  what  works  and  what  does  not  work  in  space,  cre-
ating valuable lessons for current and future programs. The ISS gives us a glimpse
of how our international partners approach building spacecraft, and NASA is learn-
ing many lessons from our partner countries in building, operating, and maintaining
spacecraft  as  cooperative  endeavors.  Working  for  months  with  crew  members  from
other countries and cultures is an important aspect of the ISS program. Developing
methods  to  work  with  our  partners  on  the  ground  and  in  space  is  critical  to  pro-
viding additional capabilities and solutions to design challenges.

National Laboratory Opportunities

While the ISS continues to meet NASA’s mission objective to prepare for the next
steps  in  human  space  exploration,  it  will  also  offer  extraordinary  opportunities  for
advancing science and technology to other U.S. Government agencies, non-profit re-
search  foundations,  and  private  firms.  The  National  Institutes  of  Health  entered
into  an  MOU  with  NASA  in  October  of  2007  and  plans  to  issue  a  formal  research
announcement in 2008 for use of the ISS in the post-assembly period. The U.S. De-
partment  of  Agriculture,  Agricultural  Research  Service,  is  evaluating  a  similar  ar-
rangement  and  may  enter  into  an  MOU  in  the  near  future  for  plant-  and  animal-
related  research.  In  the  private  sector,  two  Space  Act  Agreements  are  currently
under  development  for  pursuing  proprietary  research  in  biotechnologies,  and  an-
other  agreement  is  pending  with  the  University  of  Colorado’s  Bioserve  Center  for
ISS-based research.

International Space Station Assembly and Resupply Operations

At this point, ISS is approximately 70 percent complete, and the only major struc-
tural  elements  left  to  be  flown  are  the  remaining  two  components  of  the  Japanese
Kibo laboratory; the final truss segment, Node 3; and the cupola, which will provide
observation  capabilities  for  operations  such  as  docking/undocking,  space  walks,
robotic activities, and Earth/celestial observations. In addition to flying these compo-
nents, the Shuttle will also provide important logistics support to the Station, deliv-
ering EXPRESS Logistics Carriers and spares.

NASA’s  Station  and  Shuttle  teams  have  proven  resourceful  and  effective  at  ad-
dressing challenges that have arisen in both programs, from using new solder points
to  resolve  the  Shuttle’s  recent  Engine  Cut-Off  (ECO)  sensor  issue,  to  performing  a
space walk to free the snagged Space Station solar array last November. In endeav-
ors which are complex both in terms of engineering and organization, there will al-
ways be the potential for events that could impact planned schedules. Currently, the
Shuttle Program is addressing challenges connected to the manufacture of External
Tanks  (ETs).  This  series  of  tanks  includes  the  first  set  of  entirely  new  ETs  that
have  been  built  since  Hurricane  Katrina,  and  we  are  experiencing  some  delays  in

the  processing  flow,  though  this  issue  now  has  been  largely  resolved.  NASA  has  a
history  of  successfully  dealing  with  such  eventualities,  and  the  Agency  has  built
margin  into  the  Shuttle  manifest  to  minimize  impacts  from  these  events.  NASA  is
on  track  to  complete  assembly  of  the  ISS  and  retire  the  Space  Shuttle  by  the  end
of FY 2010.

Over  the  past  year,  there  have  been  12  flights  to  the  ISS,  including  two  crewed
Soyuz  flights,  four  Progress  cargo  flights,  five  Space  Shuttle  assembly  flights,  and
the initial flight of the European ATV, which successfully docked to the ISS on April
3, 2008, in its initial attempt. Over the past year, including the launch of the Expe-
dition  17  crew  aboard  the  Soyuz  16  on  April  8,  there  have  been  44  people  aboard
ISS  from  9  countries,  including  the  U.S.,  Russia,  Canada,  Germany,  Italy,  Japan,
France,  Malaysia,  and  South  Korea  (the  latter  two  countries  represented  by  Space
Flight Participants flying under contract with Russia).

The June 2007 flight of Atlantis on STS–117 added a truss segment and new solar
arrays  to  the  starboard  side  of  the  Station  to  provide  increased  power.  In  August,
Endeavour brought up another truss segment and supplies, and became the first Or-
biter  to  use  a  new  power  transfer  system  that  enables  the  Space  Shuttle  to  draw
power from the Station’s solar arrays, extending the duration of the Shuttle’s visits
to Space Station. On the same mission, STS–118, teacher-turned astronaut Barbara
Morgan  conducted  a  number  of  education-related  activities  aboard  the  Space  Sta-
tion,  inspiring  students  back  on  Earth  and  realizing  the  dream  of  the  Teacher  In
Space  Project  for  which  she  and  Christa  McAuliffe  trained  more  than  two  decades
ago.  In  October  2007,  Discovery  flew  the  STS–120  mission,  which  added  the  Har-
mony node to the Station and featured a space walk to disentangle a snagged solar
array.

The  STS–120  mission  paved  the  way  for  Station  astronauts  to  conduct  a  series
of ambitious space walks and operations using the Station’s robotic arm to move the
Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 and Harmony node in preparation for the addition of
the  European  Columbus  laboratory  and  the  Japanese  Kibo  laboratory  in  2008.
These  space  walks  were  particularly  challenging  and  impressive,  as  they  were  car-
ried  out  entirely  by  the  three-person  Expedition  crews,  without  benefit  of  having  a
Shuttle  Orbiter,  with  its  additional  personnel  and  resources,  docked  to  the  Station.
NASA  continues  to  expand  the  scientific  potential  of  the  Space  Station  in  2008,
a  year  in  which  we  are  delivering  and  activating  key  research  assets  from  two  of
our  International  Partners.  In  February,  Shuttle  Atlantis  delivered  the  European
Columbus  laboratory  during  STS–122;  while  the  recently  completed  STS–123  mis-
sion  featured  the  delivery  by  Shuttle  Endeavour  of  the  experiment  logistics  module
portion  of  the  Japanese  Kibo  laboratory,  along  with  the  Canadian  Special  Purpose
Dextrous  Manipulator,  or  Dextre.  Dextre  is  a  small,  two-armed  robot  that  can  be
attached to the Station’s robotic arm to handle smaller components typically requir-
ing  a  space-walking  astronaut.  At  the  tip  of  each  arm  is  a  ‘‘hand’’  that  consists  of
retractable  jaws  used  to  grip  objects.  This  will  allow  astronauts  to  conduct  oper-
ations  and  maintenance  activities  from  inside  the  Space  Station,  rather  than  via
space walks. In May, STS–124 will deliver the pressurized module component of the
Kibo lab.

The  European  ATV  vehicle,  which  is  currently  docked  to  the  ISS,  is  a  welcome
and  vital  addition  to  the  ISS  cargo  transportation  system.  On  its  maiden  voyage,
the  ATV  rendezvoused  and  docked  to  the  ISS  nearly  flawlessly.  It  is  carrying  crew
supplies, fuel, water, and air that are required to sustain the crew and on-orbit op-
erations  of  the  ISS.  The  ATV  technologies  and  capabilities  that  were  flight-dem-
onstrated represent a significant accomplishment for the European government and
industry  aerospace  community.  It  is  also  a  testament  to  the  level  of  trust  and  co-
operation between multiple international partners.

NASA  is  planning  to  address  the  issue  of  Space  Station  crew  transportation  and
cargo resupply after the retirement of the Space Shuttle in FY 2010 through a vari-
ety of methods. On April 11, 2008, NASA submitted a proposed amendment to Con-
gress  to  extend  the  exception  under  the  Iran,  North  Korea  and  Syria  Nonprolifera-
tion  Act  (INKSNA)  that  allows  the  Agency  to  pay  Russia  for  Soyuz  crew  transpor-
tation and rescue services. Under the proposed amendment, this relief would be ex-
tended  until  the  Orion  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  reaches  Full  Operational  Capa-
bility  (planned  for  2016)  or  a  U.S.  commercial  provider  of  crew  transportation  and
rescue  services  demonstrates  the  capability  to  meet  ISS  mission  requirements.  The
proposal  would  also  continue  to  allow  payments,  in  cash  and  in  kind,  for  Russian-
unique  equipment  and  capabilities  through  the  life  of  the  Station;  these  would  in-
clude sustaining engineering and spares (for example, acquiring Russian equipment
for use in training in the U.S., and hardware, such as spares, to outfit the Russian-
built, but U.S.-owned, Zarya module).

NASA is not seeking INKSNA relief to purchase Progress cargo capability beyond
2011,  however.  The  Agency  is  encouraging  the  development  of  U.S.  commercial
cargo resupply capabilities through the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services
(COTS) effort, and released a Request For Proposals (RFP) for commercial resupply
services  on  April  14,  2008.  We  also  have  agreements  for  use  of  the  European  ATV
and  the  Japanese  HTV.  In  using  multiple  service  providers,  NASA  hopes  to  mini-
mize the risk to continued Station viability and promote the development of a com-
petitive,  low-Earth  orbit  space  economy,  which  will  grow  as  both  government  and
non-government users increase the demand for on-orbit services. If U.S. commercial
cargo capabilities are not available as early as desired, the Agency will depend sole-
ly  on  the  cargo  up-mass  capability  of  the  ATV  and  HTV  and  rely  on  pre-positioned
important  spares,  delivered  by  the  Shuttle  before  its  retirement  in  2010,  until  U.S.
commercial cargo capabilities are available.

The ISS Program continues to evaluate the up-mass requirements and spares pro-
curement  strategy  to  sustain  nominal  system  and  research  operations.  Evaluations
are  based  on  actual  flight  performance  of  on-board  systems  as  well  as  estimates  of
component  lifetimes.  Internal  and  external  system  performance  continues  to  per-
form better than expected except for a few notable components, including the CMGs,
Beta Gimbal Assembly and the Solar Array Rotary Joint. Further reductions in up-
mass requirements and crew time allocations required to maintain safe on-board op-
erations continue to be aggressively pursued.

Conclusion

Recent  ISS  assembly  accomplishments  are  the  direct  result  of  years  of  careful
planning,  diligence  through  tragedy  and  challenges,  and  the  efforts  of  a  worldwide
human  space  flight  community  dedicated  to  the  completion  of  a  goal—to  build  and
operate a world-class research facility in low-Earth orbit. The ISS Program has been
successful because of the flexibility and resourcefulness of the Partnership in adapt-
ing  to  changing  environments,  including  challenges  such  as  the  retirement  of  the
Space  Shuttle  in  FY  2010,  elimination  of  habitation  and  centrifuge  facilities,  and
schedule  delays  with  Space  Shuttle  flights  and  the  deployment  of  new  transpor-
tation capabilities.

The efforts of thousands of people around the world over the past two decades are
about  to  pay  off.  The  ISS  Program  is  entering  its  intensive  research  phase.  The
same  careful  planning,  diligence,  stable  goals,  and  dedicated  efforts  that  have  re-
sulted in the accomplishments to date are now required to be employed in the devel-
opment of a robust U.S. research program. The Agency will continue its exploration-
related research at the same time that we are progressing to expand the use of the
ISS  to  other  Government  agencies  as  well  as  commercial  users.  NASA’s  National
Laboratory  effort  is  key  to  this  expansion  of  U.S.  research  utilization  aboard  the
ISS.  Yet,  the  U.S.  is  not  alone  in  utilizing  the  ISS  for  research;  Station  partners
Japan  and  Europe  have  maintained  a  broad-based  research  program  in  basic  phys-
ics,  material  sciences,  pharmaceuticals,  biology,  technology,  and  other  areas.  The
groundwork  for  the  U.S.  utilization  of  the  ISS  is  being  laid  today.  The  continued
stability  of  the  Program  is  important  to  both  the  realization  of  the  research  poten-
tial of the Station and to the development of commercial transportation services that
can serve Government and non-government users in the new space economy.

NASA’s  leadership  has  been  instrumental  in  developing  and  maintaining  a  truly
remarkable  worldwide  partnership  in  human  space  flight.  The  ISS  is  currently
being  operated  from  the  ground  from  six  countries:  Russia,  Japan,  Canada,  Ger-
many, France, and the United States. This partnership has demonstrated its ability
to  be  flexible  and  take  on  challenges  when  required  to  do  so  by  unforeseen  cir-
cumstances. As the ISS is completed later this decade, not only will the Partnership
have completed its goal to build a world-class orbiting research platform, but it will
also  have  built  an  unprecedented  global  community  committed  to  human  space
flight  exploration.  The  ISS  has  played  a  key  role  in  advancing  U.S.  leadership  in
space operations and has the potential to provide an even larger role in the commer-
cialization  of  space  transportation  and  research.  ISS  is  an  invaluable  training
ground for the next generation of space explorers and researchers.

I  would  be  happy  to  respond  to  any  question  you  or  the  other  Members  of  the

Subcommittee may have.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you.
Ms. Chaplain.

STATEMENT  OF  MS.  CRISTINA  T.  CHAPLAIN,  DIRECTOR,  AC-
QUISITION  AND  SOURCING  MANAGEMENT,  U.S.  GOVERN-
MENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
Ms.  CHAPLAIN.  Thank  you  for  asking  me  to  discuss  our  work  on
challenges  related  to  completing  and  sustaining  the  International
Space  Station.  This  program  has  clearly  achieved  significant  suc-
cesses  in  engineering,  technology  development,  as  well  as  in  build-
ing  effective  international  partnerships.  The  logistical  and  tech-
nical  problems  that  have  been  overcome  in  just  the  last  year  are
a  testament  to  the  program’s  agility  and  ingenuity  under  extreme
pressures.

However, the ISS has also struggled with significant cost growth,
scheduled  delays,  redesigns,  as  well  as  changes  in  requirements
and  content.  Such  challenges,  in  fact,  have  forced  cutbacks  and
planned capabilities and scientific research.

A recent change with wide-ranging impacts on the program is, of
course,  the  decision  to  retire  the  Space  Shuttle  in  2010.  This  was
considered  necessary  to  enable  NASA  to  develop  new  launch  and
transportation vehicles needed to support the President’s vision for
space.  But  it  leaves  NASA  with  little  flexibility  in  the  Shuttle
schedule  more  at  risk  for  not  completing  the  Station  as  planned,
more  at  risk  for  not  being  able  to  effectively  support  the  Station,
and more dependent on other countries.

The  schedule  for  completing  the  Station,  for  example,  is  only
slightly less demanding than it was prior to the Columbia disaster
when  the  agency  launched  a  Shuttle  every  other  month  with  a
larger fleet. Though there is some reserve, the schedule leaves little
room for the kinds of weather-related technical and logistical prob-
lems that have delayed flights in the past.

NASA remains confident that the current manifest can be accom-
plished  within  the  given  time,  and  there  are  tradeoffs  NASA  can
make  in  terms  of  what  it  can  take  up  to  the  Station  should  unan-
ticipated  delays  occur.  However,  failure  to  complete  assembly  as
currently  planned  could  further  reduce  the  Station’s  ability  to  ful-
fill  its  research  objectives  and  short  the  Station  of  critical  spare
parts that only the Shuttle can deliver.

In  the  event  that  NASA  completes  assembly  of  the  Station  on
schedule  and  pre-positions  an  adequate  number  of  spares,  the
agency  still  faces  a  host  of  challenges  in  sustaining  the  station
until its retirement.

Simply  put,  there  is  no  other  vehicle  available  with  the  capacity
of the Shuttle to deliver supplies. Instead, the program will rely on
vehicles  developed  by  its  international  partners,  the  commercial
sector, and NASA under the Ares and Orion Programs.

While it seems that NASA has an array of options, there are sub-
stantial limitations. One, only the Russian vehicles have proven ca-
pability,  though  the  recent  operational  tests  of  the  European  vehi-
cle  is  a  good  indication  that  this  will  not  continue  to  be  the  case.
Two,  all  vehicles  currently  or  nearly  available  have  mass  capac-

ities far below the Shuttles.

Three, only the Soyuz vehicle can carry crew.
Four, neither the European, Japanese, or Russian progress vehi-
cle  can  take  experiments  or  other  materials  back  down  to  Earth.
They are expendable vehicles.

Five, more capability is planned for the COTS vehicles, but their
schedules  are  considered  by  many  to  be  highly  optimistic  and
schedule slips have already occurred.

Six,  NASA’s  Orion  vehicle  is  not  expected  to  come  on  line  until
2015,  and  we  have  found  that  it  is  not  certain  that  this  date  will
be met due to inherent technical complexities and production chal-
lenges.

Within  this  context  it  is  our  understanding  that  NASA  would
like  to  rely  solely  on  commercial  vehicles  to  take  cargo  to  the  Sta-
tion beginning in 2013. The aim is to fully incentivize the commer-
cial industry to develop capabilities that are needed to support the
Vision in the long-term. There is merit to this objective as commer-
cial  suppliers  are  being  counted  on  to  reduce  the  costs  of  access  to
space and to introduce new concepts and capabilities needed to sus-
tain our country’s technical edge.

But  there  are  also  risks  with  this  approach,  particularly  if  the
commercial  efforts  are  unsuccessful  and  more  established  vehicles
cannot  be  brought  back  into  production  quickly.  NASA  is  well
aware  of  the  predicament  it  faces  both  in  completing  and  sus-
taining  the  Station,  and  it  has  weighted  options  and  tradeoffs.  It
is  important  in  going  forward  that  flexibility  continue  to  be  main-
tained  as  events  impacting  schedule  occur  and  that  contingencies
be well thought out and planned so that results can be maximized.
Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  statement,  and  I  am  happy  to

answer any questions you have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CRISTINA T. CHAPLAIN

NASA: Challenges in Completing and Sustaining the

International Space Station

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

I  am  pleased  to  be  here  to  discuss  challenges  that  the  National  Aeronautics  and
Space  Administration  (NASA)  faces  in  completing  and  sustaining  the  International
Space  Station  (ISS).  After  delays  and  redesigns,  efforts  are  under  way  for  a  long-
envisioned  expansion  of  the  station  so  it  can  support  a  larger  crew  and  more  sci-
entific research. NASA officials estimate the entire cost to complete the station will
total  $31  billion,  and  another  $11  billion  will  be  needed  to  sustain  it  through  its
planned decommissioning in fiscal year 2016.

The Space Shuttle has been and is critical to completion of the space station and
re-supplying  the  station.  The  Shuttle  remains  the  only  vehicle  capable  of  trans-
porting  large  segments  of  the  station  into  orbit  for  assembly.  NASA  plans  to  com-
plete  ISS  assembly  duties  and  retire  the  Shuttle  fleet  in  2010  in  order  to  pursue
a  new  generation  of  space  flight  vehicles  for  exploration.  To  that  end,  NASA  has
begun the process of making key decisions on suppliers that will no longer be need-
ed. NASA officials told us that in many cases, restarting suppliers after these deci-
sions  are  made  would  be  cost  prohibitive  and  time  consuming.  However,  a  new
NASA  vehicle  will  not  be  available  until  2015  at  the  earliest,  when  the  Crew
Launch  Vehicle  (Aces  1)  and  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (Orion)  are  expected  to  fly.
To  fill  the  gap  following  retirement  of  the  Shuttle  and  provide  crew  rotation  and
logistical  support,  NASA  plans  to  rely  on  a  variety  of  spacecraft  developed  by  the
commercial sector and other countries.

In  July  2007,  we  testified  on  a  number  of  challenges  NASA  was  facing  with  re-
gard  to  completing  the  ISS  within  the  time  constraints  created  by  the  Shuttle’s  re-
tirement.  Those  challenges  are  still  relevant.  In  light  of  these  issues,  we  examined
the risks and challenges NASA faces in (1) completing assembly of the ISS by 2010,
and (2) providing logistics and maintenance support to the ISS after 2010.

72

In  short,  our  work  continued  to  find  that  NASA’s  plans  to  complete  assembly  of
the International Space Station prior to the scheduled retirement of the Space Shut-
tle  at  end  of  fiscal  year  2010  require  much  to  happen  and  very  little  to  go  wrong.
While  NASA  believes  the  schedule  is  still  achievable,  the  flight  rate  that  NASA  is
projecting is only slightly less aggressive than it was prior to the Columbia disaster1
when, from 1992 to 2003, the agency launched a Shuttle every other month. At that
time, NASA used four vehicles to maintain its flight schedule. To complete the sta-
tion  by  2010,  NASA  will  need  to  maintain  a  similar  flight  rate  with  fewer  Shuttles
and with a Shuttle fleet that is aging and continuing to face fuel sensor challenges.
NASA  remains  confident  that  the  current  manifest  can  be  accomplished  within  the
given time, and in fact, it has several months of reserve time in its manifest. How-
ever,  agency  officials  readily  admit  that  the  schedule  is  aggressive.  If  delays  con-
tinue,  NASA  may  need  to  reduce  the  number  of  flights  to  the  station,  which  could
prevent  delivery  of  items  currently  scheduled  for  assembly  and  the  pre-positioning
of  critical  spares.  Further,  while  NASA  still  expects  to  be  able  to  increase  crew  ca-
pacity from three to six persons, changes it may need to make to the space station’s
configuration  could  limit  the  extent  of  scientific  research  that  can  be  conducted  on-
board the ISS or quality of life for the crew.

After  assembly  is  completed  and  the  Shuttle  is  retired,  NASA’s  ability  to  rotate
crew and supply the ISS will be impaired because of the absence of a vehicle capable
of  carrying  the  114,199  pounds  (or  51.8  metric  tons)  of  additional  supplies  needed
to  sustain  the  station  until  its  planned  retirement  in  fiscal  year  2016.  NASA  plans
to  rely  on  Russian,  European  and  Japanese  vehicles  to  service  the  station.  Even
with  these  vehicles,  this  shortfall  remains.  While  the  Russian  vehicles  are  already
in  service,  the  European  vehicle  just  completed  its  first  operational  test  flight,  and
development  efforts  are  still  under  way  on  the  Japanese  vehicle.  In  addition,  these
vehicles were designed to augment the capabilities of the Shuttle, not replace them.
Both  the  European  and  Japanese  vehicles  were  designed  to  deliver  supplies  to  the
station but their capacities are not equal to the Shuttle’s 37,864 pounds of capacity.
Furthermore,  aside  from  a  single  Russian  vehicle  that  can  bring  back  132  pounds
of  cargo  and  rotate  crew,  no  vehicle  can  return  cargo  from  the  International  Space
Station  after  the  Shuttle  is  retired.  NASA  plans  to  rely  on  commercially  developed
vehicles  to  address  some  of  these  shortfalls  and  has  pledged  approximately  $500
million  for  their  development.  NASA  expects  one  of  these  vehicles  will  be  ready  for
cargo  use  in  2010  and  crew  use  in  2012.  However,  no  vehicle  has  successfully  been
launched  into  orbit  and  their  development  schedules  may  leave  little  room  for  the
unexpected. If these vehicles cannot be delivered according to NASA’s current expec-
tations,  NASA  will  have  to  rely  on  Russian  vehicles  to  maintain  U.S.  crew  on  the
International  Space  Station  until  the  new  generation  of  U.S.  spacecraft  becomes
available.

To  conduct  our  work,  we  reviewed  documents  and  testimonies  by  NASA  officials
relating  to  the  challenges  associated  with  ISS  completion,  the  delivery  schedule  for
ISS assembly and replacement units, and the Space Shuttle manifest. We reviewed
key  ISS  budget  and  strategic  maintenance  plans,  the  ISS  Independent  Safety  Task
Force  Report,  and  previous  GAO  reports  relating  to  the  ISS.  We  visited  and  inter-
viewed officials responsible for ISS operations at NASA Headquarters, Washington,
D.C., and the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. At NASA Headquarters, we
met  with  officials  from  the  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  and  the  Space
Operations  Mission  Directorate,  including  representatives  from  the  International
Space Station and Space Shuttle programs. We met with ISS and Space Shuttle offi-
cials  at  the  Johnson  Space  Center.  We  also  talked  to  a  commercial  developer  of
space  vehicles  and  met  with  representatives  of  foreign  space  efforts.  Complete  de-
tails  of  our  scope  and  methodology  can  be  found  in  Appendix  I.  We  conducted  this
performance  audit  from  July  2007  to  April  2008,  in  accordance  with  generally  ac-
cepted  government  auditing  standards.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and
perform  the  audit  to  obtain  sufficient,  appropriate  evidence  to  provide  a  reasonable
basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that
the  evidence  obtained  provides  a  reasonable  basis  for  our  findings  and  conclusions
based on our audit objectives.

Background

The  International  Space  Station  program  began  in  1993  with  several  partner
countries:  Canada,  the  11  member  nations  of  the  European  Space  Agency  (ESA),

1 In 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia broke up as it returned to Earth after 16 days in orbit.
After  the  accident  of  Columbia,  the  Shuttle  fleet  was  grounded  for  approximately  two  and  one-
half  years.  During  that  the  time,  U.S.  crew  and  supplies  were  launched  in  the  Russian  Soyuz
and Progress.

Japan,  and  Russia.  The  ISS  has  served  and  is  intended  to  expand  its  service  as  a
laboratory for exploring basic questions in a variety of fields, including commercial,
scientific,  and  engineering  research.  The  first  assembly  flight  of  the  station,  in
which the Space Shuttle Endeavor attached the U.S. laboratory module to the Rus-
sian laboratory module, occurred in early December of 1998. However, since the pro-
gram’s  inception,  NASA  has  struggled  with  cost  growth,  schedule  delays  and  rede-
signs  of  the  station.  As  we  reported  in  the  past,  these  challenges  were  largely  due
to  poorly  defined  requirements,  changes  in  program  content  and  inadequate  pro-
gram  oversight.  Due  to  these  challenges,  the  configuration  of  the  station  has  de-
volved over time. In the spring of 2001, NASA announced that it would make major
changes  in  the  final  configuration  of  the  ISS  to  address  cost  overruns.  In  2003,  the
National  Academies  reported  that  this  reconfiguration  greatly  affected  the  overall
ability  of  the  ISS  to  support  science.  NASA  estimates  that  assembly  and  operating
costs  of  the  ISS  will  be  between  $2.1  billion  to  $2.4  billion  annually  for  FY  2009–
FY  2012.  The  ISS  as  of  February  19,  2008,  is  approximately  65  percent  complete.
The Shuttle program and the ISS program are inherently intertwined. The Shut-
tle has unique capabilities in that it can lift and return more cargo to and from orbit
than  any  other  current  or  planned  space  vehicle.  Figure  1  shows  the  capabilities  of
the  Shuttle  in  various  configurations.  Most  segments  of  ISS  cannot  be  delivered  by
any other vehicle. For example, the Columbia disaster in 2003 put ISS assembly on
hiatus  as  NASA  ceased  Shuttle  launches  for  two  and  one-half  years  while  it  inves-
tigated  the  safety  of  the  fleet.  During  this  period,  the  Russian  Soyuz  became  the
means of transportation for crew members traveling to and returning from the ISS.

In  a  major  space  policy  address  on  January  14,  2004,  President  Bush  announced
his  ‘‘Vision  for  U.S.  Space  Exploration’’  (Vision)  and  directed  NASA  to  focus  its  fu-
ture  human  space  exploration  activities  on  a  return  to  the  Moon  as  prelude  to  fu-
ture  human  missions  to  Mars  and  beyond.  As  part  of  the  Vision,  NASA  is  devel-
oping  new  crew  and  cargo  vehicles,  with  the  first  crew  vehicle  currently  scheduled
to be available in 2015. The President also directed NASA to retire the Space Shut-
tle  after  completion  of  the  ISS,  which  is  planned  for  the  end  of  the  decade.  Based
on  that  directive,  NASA  officials  told  us  that  they  developed  a  manifest  consisting
of 17 Shuttle launches to support ISS assembly and supply between 2005 and 2010.2
Nine  of  these  have  taken  place.  In  response  to  the  President’s  Vision,  NASA  for-
mally  set  September  30,  2010,  as  the  date  that  the  Shuttle  program  will  cease  be-
cause  agency  officials  believe  that  continuing  the  program  beyond  that  date  will

2 The manifest includes 18 total flights, but one of the launches is reserved for repairs to the

Hubble Space Telescope.

slow development of the agency’s new vehicles—specifically, the agency budget can-
not support both programs at costs of $2.5 billion to $4 billion above current budget.
As shown in Table 1, the Shuttle program costs NASA several billion dollars annu-
ally  and  projected  funding  is  phased  out  in  fiscal  year  2011.  NASA  officials  stated
that the majority of Shuttle program cost is fixed at roughly $3 billion a year wheth-
er it flies or not. NASA officials stated that the average cost per flight is $150 mil-
lion to $200 million.3

The  2005  NASA  Authorization  Act  designated  the  U.S.  segment  of  the  ISS  as  a
national laboratory and directed NASA to develop a plan to increase the utilization
of  the  ISS  by  other  federal  entities  and  the  private  sector.  In  response,  NASA  has
been  pursuing  relationships  with  these  entities.  NASA  expects  that  as  the  Nation’s
newest national laboratory, the ISS will strengthen NASA’s relationships with other
federal  entities  and  private  sector  leaders  in  the  pursuit  of  national  priorities  for
the advancement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The ISS Na-
tional  Laboratory  is  also  intended  to  open  new  paths  for  the  exploration  and  eco-
nomic development of space.

It  will  be  a  challenge  for  NASA  to  complete  the  space  station  by  2010  given  the
compressed  nature  of  the  schedule,  maintenance  and  safety  concerns,  as  well  as
events  beyond  its  control  such  as  weather.  Any  of  these  factors  can  cause  delays
that  may  require  NASA  to  re-evaluate  and  reconstitute  the  assembly  sequence.
NASA  remains  confident  that  the  current  manifest  can  be  accomplished  within  the
given  time  and  there  are  tradeoffs  NASA  can  make  in  terms  of  what  it  can  take
up  to  support  and  sustain  the  station  should  unanticipated  delays  occur.  However,
failure to complete assembly as currently planned would further reduce the station’s
ability  to  fulfill  its  research  objectives  and  short  the  station  of  critical  spare  parts
that only the Shuttle can currently deliver.

Shuttle Flight Schedule Is Aggressive

In  our  July  2007  testimony,  we  reported  that  NASA  planned  to  launch  a  Shuttle
once  every  2.7  months.  The  plan  for  launches  remains  aggressive,  partly  because
NASA  plans  on  completing  the  ISS  with  the  last  assembly  mission  in  April  2010,
with  two  contingency  flights  in  February  and  July  2010  to  deliver  key  replacement
units. The five months between the last assembly launch and Shuttle retirement in
September  2010  act  as  a  schedule  reserve,  which  can  be  used  to  address  delays.
There  are  eight  Shuttle  flights  left  to  complete  the  station  and  two  contingency
flights  left  to  deliver  key  components  necessary  to  sustain  the  ISS  after  the  retire-
ment  of  the  Shuttle.  There  is  an  average  of  two  and  one-half  months  between  each
Shuttle launch.4 Table 2 shows the current Shuttle manifest.

3 This cost is based on hardware, such as the booster rocket, used for the Shuttles.
4 This includes one mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope and two contingency flights.

NASA has launched Shuttles at this rate in the past. In fact, the agency launched
a  Shuttle,  on  average,  every  two  months  from  1992  through  the  Columbia  disaster
in  2003.  However,  at  that  time  the  agency  was  launching  a  fleet  of  four  Shuttles.5
The Shuttles require maintenance and refurbishing that can last four to five months
before  they  can  be  re-launched.  Launching  at  such  a  rate  means  that  the  rotation
schedule can handle few significant delays, such as those previously experienced due
to  weather  and  fuel  sensor  difficulties.  Lastly,  NASA  officials  said  that  Shuttle
Atlantis,  which  was  to  go  out  of  service  after  the  Hubble  mission,  will  return  to
servicing the ISS for two more flights, which NASA believes will add more schedule
flexibility.

5 The remaining three Shuttles are the Atlantis, Discovery, and Endeavor.

Potential Launch Delays Remain

NASA  officials  stated  repeatedly  that  NASA  is  committed  to  safely  flying  the
Shuttle  until  its  retirement  and  will  not  succumb  to  schedule  pressure.  However,
the  compressed  nature  of  the  manifest  will  continue  to  test  that  commitment.  Fuel
sensor  challenges  continue  to  surface  in  the  Shuttle  fleet.  For  example,  the  recent
Shuttle Atlantis launch was delayed two months while NASA addressed a fuel sen-
sor  problem  associated  with  the  Shuttle’s  liquid  hydrogen  tank.  This  is  the  same
system that caused a two-week delay in the launch of the Shuttle Discovery in 2005.
There are also challenges associated with the Shuttle launch window. NASA offi-
cials told us that the duration of that window is dependent on a number of factors,
which  include  changes  in  the  position  of  the  Earth  and  spacecraft  traffic  restric-
tions.  NASA  must  consider  its  traffic  model  constraints  for  vehicles  docking  at  the
space station. According to the traffic model for ISS, no other vehicle can dock while
the  Shuttle  is  docked,  and  each  vehicle  has  constraints  on  how  long  it  can  stay
docked.  For  example,  the  Shuttle  can  dock  for  a  maximum  of  10  days,  while  the
Soyuz  can  dock  a  maximum  of  200  days.  The  docking  of  these  two  vehicles  must
be coordinated and meet other technical restrictions.

In  addition,  the  Shuttle  has  experienced  delays  due  to  severe  weather,  such  as
when Atlantis’s external tank was damaged by a hailstorm in 2007. In this case the
delay was about three months. Figure 3 shows the delays in recent Shuttle launches
related to weather and other causes.

Completion of ISS Needed to Expand Scientific Research

The ISS is scheduled to support a six-person crew as early as 2009 and maintain
that  capability  through  2016.  NASA  officials  said  that  equipment  essential  to  sup-
port a six-person crew, such as systems for oxygen recycling, removal of carbon diox-
ide and transforming urine into water as well as an exercise machine will be deliv-
ered  to  the  station  this  fall.  In  addition,  there  are  two  components  that  have  been
planned to hold this and other equipment needed for the six-person crew, which are
scheduled  to  go  up  in  April  2010.  If  unanticipated  delays  occur,  NASA  may  need
to  hold  back  these  two  components—known  as  the  Node  3  and  the  Cupola—which
could constrain the ability to conduct research and the quality of life on the station
for the crew.

NASA  officials  emphasized  that  NASA’s  intent  was  to  have  most  science  con-
ducted on ISS only after the assembly of the ISS was completed. The ISS currently
supports  three  crew  members.  NASA  stated  that  the  majority  of  the  crew’s  time  is
spent maintaining the station, rather than conducting scientific study. According to
NASA, the crew spends no more than three hours per week on science. Completion
of  the  ISS  would  allow  NASA  to  expand  to  a  six-person  crew  who  could  conduct
more research.

Since the ISS is designated as a national laboratory, the expectation is that it will
support  scientific  experimentation.  NASA  is  in  the  process  of  negotiating  agree-
ments  with  scientific  organizations  to  support  scientific  research  on  the  ISS.  NASA
officials told us that they are negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding with the
National  Institutes  of  Health  to  explore  the  possibility  of  scientific  experimentation
on-board the ISS. These officials also told us that NASA is in the process of negoti-
ating with at least two other agencies.

The  Need  to  Pre-position  Replacement  Units  to  Sustain  the  ISS  May  Also  Affect  As-

sembly

NASA’s efforts to complete the ISS are further complicated by the need to put re-
placement units—the spare parts that are essential to sustaining the ISS—into posi-
tion before the Shuttle retires. The two contingency flights of the Shuttle have been
designated to deliver these key replacement units, which only the Shuttle is capable
of carrying. According to NASA, the original approach to deal with these key compo-
nents  (also  known  as  orbital  replacement  units—ORU6 )  was  to  take  the  ones  that
failed  or  reached  the  end  of  their  lifetime  back  to  Earth  on  the  Shuttle,  refurbish
them  and  launch  them  back  to  ISS  for  use.  As  a  result  of  the  Shuttle  retirement,
NASA  will  no  longer  be  bringing  down  ORUs  to  fix.  Instead,  NASA  officials  stated
they have adopted a ‘‘build and burn’’ philosophy, which means that after the Shut-
tle retires, instead of being brought down to be refurbished, ORUs will be discarded
and  disintegrate  upon  re-entry  into  the  atmosphere.  To  determine  how  many  re-
placement  units  need  to  be  positioned  at  the  station,  NASA  officials  told  us  they
are using data modeling that has been very effective in determining how long ORUs
will last. Table 3 illustrates the Shuttle manifest. This includes elements needed for
the planned configuration to complete the station and delivery of critical spares.

6 Orbital  Replacement  Units  (ORU),  according  to  NASA  officials,  are  critical  spares  are  nec-

essary to sustain the ISS.

NASA  currently  plans  to  use  two  contingency  flights  for  these  replacements  be-
cause all other flights are planned with assembly cargo. Recently, the NASA Admin-
istrator  publicly  stated  that  these  flights  are  considered  necessary  to  sustain  the
ISS and have been scheduled to carry key spare units.

Alternative Vehicle Options to Service the International Space Station Pose

Challenges

In  the  event  that  NASA  completes  assembly  of  the  ISS  on  schedule  and  preposi-
tions an adequate number of critical spares, the agency still faces a myriad of chal-
lenges in sustaining the research facility until its retirement, currently planned for
fiscal year 2016. Without the Shuttle, NASA officials told us that they face a signifi-
cant  cargo  supply  shortfall  and  very  limited  crew  rotation  capabilities.  NASA  will
rely on an assortment of vehicles in order to provide the necessary logistical support
and  crew  rotation  capabilities  required  by  the  station.  Some  of  these  vehicles  axe
already  supporting  the  station.  Others  are  being  developed  by  international  part-
ners,  the  commercial  sector,  and  NASA.  (See  Figure  4)  Furthermore,  some  of  these
transportation  services  may  face  legal  restrictions,  and  still  others  face  cost,  sched-
ule,  and  performance  issues  that  raise  serious  questions  about  their  development
and utilization. These issues will challenge NASA’s ability to close the sustainment
gap between the retirement of the Shuttle in 2010 and the availability of the Crew
Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV)  in  2015.  Failure  of  any  or  some  of  these  efforts  would
also  seriously  restrict  NASA’s  options  to  sustain  and  maintain  a  viable  space  sta-
tion.

Russian Vehicles

With the exception of the Shuttle and the recently completed demonstration flight
of  the  ATV,  the  only  vehicles  currently  capable  of  supporting  the  space  station  are
the  Russian  Progress  and  Soyuz  vehicles.  NASA  officials  stated  that  both  of  these
vehicles  have  provided  reliable  service  to  the  ISS.  From  the  Columbia  disaster  in
2003  until  return  to  flight  in  2005,  the  Russian  vehicles  were  the  sole  source  of
logistical support and crew rotation capability for the station. The Progress provides
atmospheric gas, propellant, water, and pressurized cargo. It also has the capability
to use its thrusters to change the Station’s altitude and orientation. The Soyuz pro-
vides crew delivery and rescue capability for three crew members. Progress vehicles
are  expendable  and  offer  no  recoverable  return  capability,  but  provide  important
trash removal capabilities. Soyuz vehicles have a limited recoverable cargo capacity.
However, some NASA officials have suggested that their limited capabilities restrict
the capacity of the station to move to a six-member crew and significantly limit the
scientific  research  because  the  vehicles  cannot  bring  experiments  to  Earth  for  as-
sessment. NASA currently purchases crew and cargo transport services from Russia
through a contract with the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos).

NASA  officials  told  us  that  after  the  initial  ISS  contract  between  Roscosmos  and
NASA  expired,  NASA  entered  into  another  contract  that  runs  through  2011.  How-
ever,  according  to  NASA,  the  Iran  Nonproliferation  Act  of  2000  restricted  certain
payments  in  connection  to  the  ISS  that  may  be  made  to  the  Russian  government.
In  2005,  NASA  requested  relief  from  the  restrictions  of  the  Act,  and  Congress

amended the Act.7 Through this amendment, NASA and Roscosmos have negotiated
quantities and prices for services through January 1, 2012.

NASA officials anticipate the use of four Soyuz flights per year and approximately
six  Progress  flights  beginning  in  approximately  2010.  While  NASA  officials  stated
that they are making every effort to limit amount of fees they pay for usage of Rus-
sian  vehicles,  to  date,  NASA  officials  told  us  that  they  anticipate  that  from  fiscal
year 2009 to fiscal year 2012, NASA will spend $589 million on cargo and crew serv-
ices  from  the  Russians.8 NASA  officials  also  told  us  that  the  Roscosmos  has  sug-
gested that it will charge NASA higher fees for usage of its vehicles.

European and Japanese Vehicles

NASA  has  stated  it  will  use  its  international  partners’  vehicles  to  conduct  some
supply  activities.  Specifically,  Japan’s  Aerospace  Exploration  Agency  (JAXA)  H–II
Transfer  Vehicle  (HTV)  and  the  European  Space  Agency’s  (ESA)  Automated  Trans-
fer  Vehicle  (ATV)  vehicles  will  be  used  for  bringing  up  cargo.  NASA’s  reliance  on
the  ATV  and  HTV  assumes  that  these  vehicles  will  be  ready  to  service  the  ISS  by
the time the Shuttle stops flying in 2010.

The  new  vehicles  being  developed  by  the  European  and  Japanese  space  agencies
are  very  complex.  The  ATV  had  a  development  timeline  of  20  years.  Its  first  oper-
ational  test  flight  to  the  ISS  was  in  March  2008.  NASA  has  stated  that  both  the
European  and  Japanese  vehicle  development  programs  experienced  technical  hur-
dles  and  budgetary  constraints,  but  are  committed  to  fulfilling  their  roles  as  part-
ners in the ISS program. NASA officials told us they have confidence the European
vehicle will be available for ISS operations before retirement of the Shuttle, but they
are not as confident about the Japanese vehicle’s being ready by that time. The Jap-
anese  vehicle  is  still  under  development  and  has  faced  some  setbacks.  NASA  offi-
cials told us that the HTV’s first test launch is planned for July 2009.

7 The  2005  Amendment  to  the  Iran  Nonproliferation  Act  of  2000  altered  the  Acts  definition
of  ‘‘extraordinary  payments  in  connection  with  the  International  Space  Station.’’  NASA  refers
to this amendment as its ‘‘exemption.’’

8 NASA  and  Roscosmos  have  negotiated  quantities  and  prices  for  services  through  calendar
year  2011.  According  to  NASA  it  will  require  additional  relief  from  the  restrictions  of  the  Act,
currently entitled the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act.

International Partner Vehicles Have Constraints in Ability to Ferry Crew and Cargo

to and from the ISS in Comparison to the Shuttle

In addition to potential development challenges, the international partner vehicles
have constraints in terms of what they can take to and from the ISS in comparison
to  the  Shuttle.  NASA’s  current  plans  to  manage  the  gap  after  the  Shuttle  retire-
ment  do  not  take  into  account  the  possibility  of  delays  in  the  development  of  these
vehicles,  and  even  if  they  do  come  on  line  on  time,  NASA  officials  estimate  that
there  will  be  a  significant  shortfall  to  the  ISS  of  at  least  114,199  pounds  (or  51.8
metric tons) in cargo re-supply capability. These vehicles were designed to augment
the capabilities of the Shuttle and have significantly less capability to deliver cargo
to  the  ISS.  The  Shuttle  can  carry  a  maximum  cargo  of  close  to  38,000  pounds
(17,175  kg.).  In  comparison,  the  European  ATV’s  maximum  capability  is  16,535
pounds  (7,500  kg.)  and  the  Japanese  HTV’s  average  capability  is  13,228  pounds
(6,000  kg.).  The  HTV  and  ATV  are  expendable  vehicles.  NASA  can  use  them  for
trash  removal,  but  cannot  carry  cargo  or  scientific  experiments  back  to  Earth  be-
cause the vehicles disintegrate when re-entering the atmosphere.

The  Russian  Progress  and  Soyuz  vehicles  also  have  very  limited  cargo  capacity.
For  example,  the  Progress  has  an  average  capability  of  5,732  pounds  (2,600  kg.)—
roughly  one-seventh  the  Shuttle’s  capability.  The  Progress,  like  the  ATV  and  HTV,
is  an  expendable  vehicle.  The  Soyuz  can  transport  three  crew  persons  to  the  ISS
and  can  serve  as  a  rescue  vehicle  capable  of  taking  three  crew  members  back  to
Earth.  Unlike  the  ATV  and  HTV,  the  Soyuz  does  have  the  capacity  to  bring  down
cargo—roughly 132 pounds (60 kg.). NASA officials have stated that until NASA de-
ploys  its  new  crew  exploration  vehicles  or  commercial  vehicles  become  available,
NASA  will  be  dependent  on  the  Russian  vehicles  for  crew  transportation  services
and  on  the  Japanese  and  European  vehicles  for  limited  cargo  services  whenever
they become available.

Figure 7 compares the up mass capabilities of the various vehicles.

Commercial Vehicles

NASA  is  working  with  the  commercial  space  sector  through  its  Commercial  Or-
bital Transportation Services (COTS) program to develop and produce vehicles that
can  take  equipment  and  crew  to  and  from  the  space  station.  NASA  expects  that
these  vehicles  will  be  ready  for  cargo  use  in  2010  and  crew  use  in  2012.  However,
these  vehicles  have  yet  to  be  successfully  launched  into  orbit,  and  some  NASA  offi-
cials  have  acknowledged  that  their  development  schedules  leave  little  room  for  the
unexpected.

Under the COTS program, NASA has pledged $500 million to promote commercial
opportunities  for  space  transportation  vehicles.  Using  Space  Act  agreements9 in-
stead  of  traditional  contracting  mechanisms,  NASA  will  make  payments  to  compa-
nies  based  on  the  achievement  of  key  milestones  during  the  development  of  their
vehicles.  These  agreements  are  both  funded  and  unfunded,  For  the  two  funded
agreements that have been reached, NASA stated that the commercial suppliers for
space  transportation  services  will  have  customers  outside  of  ISS,  including  NASA’s
Constellation  program,  which  plans  to  send  humans  back  to  the  Moon  and  eventu-
ally  Mars.  The  COTS  program  will  occur  in  phases.  In  the  first  phase  companies
will demonstrate the vehicle launch and docking capabilities with the ISS. The sec-
ond phase is the procurement of services for transportation of cargo and crew to the
ISS, which is scheduled to begin sometime in the 2010 timeframe.

NASA had seven COTS agreements through the Space Act. NASA signed five un-
funded Space Act agreements, which facilitate the sharing of technical and ISS inte-
gration  information  between  commercial  companies  and  NASA.  NASA  has  funded

9 COTS  agreements  are  Space  Act  agreements  issued  pursuant  to  NASA’s  other  transactions
authority.  These  types  of  agreements  are  not  contracts,  and  are  therefore  generally  not  subject
to  those  federal  laws  and  regulations  that  apply  to  government  contracts.  NASA  has  budgeted
$500  million  in  fiscal  year  2006  to  fiscal  year  2010  as  an  investment  for  the  demonstration  of
commercial  orbital  capabilities  and  will  be  executed  in  two  phases.  The  first  phase  consists  of
technical  development/demonstration  funded  by  the  Space  Act  agreements.  The  second  phase
may include the competitive procurement of orbital transportation services.

two  companies,  Rocketplane  Kistler  (RpK)  and  Space  Exploration  Technologies
(SpaceX).  NASA  officials  stated  that  through  the  funded  Space  Act  agreements,
SpaceX has received $139 million for its project and is still working on successfully
launching  a  vehicle  that  can  reach  low-Earth  orbit.  The  company  successfully  com-
pleted  a  critical  design  review  in  August  2007  and  told  us  that  it  is  planning  its
first orbital demonstration test flight for June 2009. NASA officials told us that RpK
received  $37  million  in  funding,  but  then  forfeited  the  remainder  of  its  share  be-
cause  it  did  not  meet  certain  financial  development  milestones.  When  NASA  began
to redistribute these forfeited funds, RpK filed a bid protest with GAO, which GAO
denied.  NASA  officials  then  moved  forward  and  awarded  $170  million  to  Orbital
Sciences Corporation in February 2008.

NASA officials acted quickly to award the forfeited money and expect that SpaceX
will have cargo capability available in 2010 (by the time the Shuttle is retired) and
crew capability 112012. While SpaceX has been meeting key milestones in the devel-
opment of its vehicle, some officials at the Johnson Space Center were skeptical that
COTS would be available on the current projected schedule. Additionally, the Inter-
national Space Station Independent Safety Task Force (IISTF) reported that design,
development  and  certification  of  the  new  COTS  program  was  just  beginning  and
that ‘‘if similar to other new program development activities, it most likely will take
much longer than expected and will cost more than anticipated.’’ In our opinion, the
schedule  is  optimistic  when  compared  to  other  government  and  commercial  space
programs  we  have  studied.  We  will  be  studying  the  COTS  program  and  schedules
in more detail in response to a request of Members of Congress.

Ares I and Orion

NASA is under pressure to develop its own vehicles quickly as the Space Shuttle’s
retirement in 2010 means that there could be at least a five-year gap in our nation’s
ability  to  send  humans  to  space.  Among  the  first  major  items  of  NASA’s  develop-
ment  efforts  to  implement  the  Vision  program  are  the  development  of  new  space
flight  systems—including  the  Ares  I  Crew  Launch  Vehicle  and  the  Orion  Crew  Ex-
ploration  Vehicle.  Ares  I  and  Orion  are  currently  targeted  for  operation  no  later
than  2015.  NASA  plans  to  use  these  vehicles  as  they  become  available  to  service
the space station.

However, we recently testified that there are considerable unknowns as to wheth-
er  NASA’s  plans  for  the  Ares  I  and  Orion  vehicles  can  be  executed  within  schedule
goals,  as  well  as  what  these  efforts  will  ultimately  cost.  This  is  primarily  because
NASA  is  still  in  the  process  of  defining  many  of  the  project’s  performance  require-
ments  and  some  of  these  uncertainties  could  affect  the  mass,  loads,  and  weight  re-
quirements  for  the  vehicles.  Such  uncertainty  has  created  knowledge  gaps  that  are
affecting  many  aspects  of  both  projects.  For  example,  a  design  analysis  cycle  com-
pleted  in  May  2007  revealed  an  unexpected  increase  in  ascent  loads  (the  physical
strain  on  the  spacecraft  during  launch)  that  could  result  in  increases  to  the  weight
of the Orion vehicle and both stages of the Ares I.

NASA  recognizes  the  risks  involved  with  its  approach  and  it  is  taking  steps  to
mitigate  those  risks.  However,  given  the  complexity  of  the  Orion  and  Ares  I  efforts
and  their  interdependencies,  any  significant  requirements  changes  can  have  rever-
berating effects and make it extremely difficult to establish firm cost estimates and
schedule baselines. If knowledge gaps persist, programs will cost more, fail to meet
their  schedules,  or  deliver  less  than  originally  envisioned.  Ultimately,  NASA’s  ag-
gressive  schedule  leaves  little  room  for  the  unexpected.  If  something  goes  wrong
with the development of the Crew Launch Vehicle or the Crew Exploration Vehicle,
the  entire  Constellation  Program  could  be  thrown  off  course  and  the  return  to
human space flight further delayed.

Concluding Observations

The  decision  to  retire  the  Space  Shuttle  in  2010  has  had  profound  effects  on  the
ISS program. It leaves little flexibility in the Shuttle schedule. Any delays could re-
quire  NASA  to  choose  between  completing  the  station  as  planned  and  the  pre-posi-
tioning of needed critical spares, The decision also leaves NASA dependent on Rus-
sia  for  crew  rotation  services  until  other  vehicles  are  developed  and  demonstrated.
And  even  with  the  development  of  these  vehicles,  NASA  still  faces  a  significant  ca-
pacity shortfall in its ability to provide logistical support to the station. The shortfall
may well impact support for a six person crew and the quality of research that can
be  conducted  on  the  ISS.  At  the  same  time,  it  also  provides  opportunities  to  com-
mercial suppliers to demonstrate capabilities that could have long-term benefits for

Scope and Methodology

To  identify  the  risks  and  challenges  NASA  faces  in  completing  assembly  of  the

International Space Station by 2010, we

• analyzed  key  documents  and  testimonies  by  NASA  officials  relating  to  the
challenges  associated  with  ISS  completion.  This  included:  the  delivery  sched-
ule  for  ISS  parts  for  assembly  and  the  delivery  schedule  for  replacement
units, the Space Shuttle manifest, budget documents and the strategic main-
tenance  plan,  the  ISS  Independent  Safety  Task  Force  Report,  and  previous
GAO reports relating to the ISS.

• interviewed NASA mission officials to obtain information on the status of the
ISS.  We  also  discussed  these  issues  with  the  International  Partners  (Cana-
dian Space Agency, European Space Agency and Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency) to get their perspectives.

To  determine  the  risks  and  challenges  NASA  faces  in  providing  logistics  and

maintenance support to the International Space Station after 2010, we

• analyzed documents related to the up-mass and down-mass capabilities of the
International  Partners  and  SpaceX  vehicles,  the  shortfall  in  ISS  up-mass  for
re-supply  and  sustainment,  the  new  vehicles  that  will  support  ISS  NASA’s
plans  for  using  Russian  vehicles  to  support  ISS  through  what  NASA  refers
to as its ‘‘exemption,’’ and the impacts to the utilization of the ISS.

• We  interviewed  key  NASA  officials  from  NASA  Headquarters,  the  Space  Op-
erations  Mission  Directorate,  NASA’s  Commercial  Orbital  Transportation
Services program, and the ISS program officials, and interviewed officials rep-
resenting the International Partners.

To  accomplish  our  work,  we  visited  and  interviewed  officials  responsible  for  the
ISS  operations  at  NASA  Headquarters,  Washington,  D.C.,  and  the  Johnson  Space
Center  in  Houston,  Texas.  At  NASA  Headquarters,  we  met  with  officials  from  the
Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  and  the  Space  Operations  Mission  Direc-
torate,  including  representatives  from  the  International  Space  Station  and  Space
Shuttle  programs.  We  also  met  with  ISS  and  Space  Shuttle  mission  officials  at  the
Johnson Space Center.

We conducted this performance audit from July 2007 to April 2008, in accordance
with  generally  accepted  government  auditing  standards.  Those  standards  require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to pro-
vide  a  reasonable  basis  for  our  findings  and  conclusions  based  on  our  audit  objec-
tives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our find-
ings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

STATEMENT OF DR. JEFFREY P. SUTTON, DIRECTOR,
NATIONAL SPACE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE

Dr. SUTTON. Mr. Chairman, Judge Hall, and distinguished Mem-
bers of the Subcommittee, I thank you for the opportunity to testify
here this morning.

I  have  the  distinct  honor  of  serving  as  the  Director  of  the  Na-
tional  Space  Biomedical  Research  Institute  or  NSBRI.  And  NASA
established NSBRI in 1997, and was charged to lead a national ef-
fort for accomplishing the integrated biomedical research necessary
to  support  a  long-term  human  presence  development  and  explo-
ration of space. That mission has not changed since inception.

And  over  the  past  decade  NSBRI  has  brought  unprecedented  in-
tellectual and institutional resources to help NASA address and re-
duce  high-priority  biomedical  risks.  And  the  focus  has  been  on  the
team approach to develop counter measures or solutions to health-
related  problems  in  the  physical  and  psychological  challenges  that
men and women face on long duration space flights.

NSBRI  is  a  success  story  for  NASA.  The  Institute  attracts  out-
standing  scientists,  physicians,  and  engineers  across  the  country
and coordinates them to advance in a cost-effective way biomedical
science  and  technology  for  space  and  to  apply  results  to  enhance
life on Earth.

We are excited by a number of things. We are excited by the sci-
entific  and  technological  achievements,  by  the  growing  number  of
young  people  who  are  participating  in  the  science  and  education
programs,  and  also  by  the  accomplishments  of  the  talented  people
in  this  endeavor.  And  we  are  particularly  proud  at  this  moment,
Dr. Michael DeBakey, from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston,
and  Dr.  DeBakey  is  a  world-renowned  heart  surgeon,  innovator,
military  veteran,  leader,  and  humanitarian,  and  we  are  privileged
that  he  is  a  dedicated  and  active  member  of  the  NSBRI  Board  of
Directors.  And  yesterday  in  a  magnificent  ceremony  in  the  Ro-
tunda,  the  President  and  Congressional  leadership  presented  Dr.
DeBakey  with  the  Congressional  gold  medal,  the  most  distin-
guished award bestowed by the United States Congress, and on be-
half  of  NSBRI,  I  thank  you  for  your  support  of  the  award  to  Dr.
DeBakey.

In  my  written  testimony  there  are  responses  to  a  series  of
thoughtful  questions  posed  by  the  Subcommittee  concerning  bio-
medical  research  and  the  ISS.  What  I  would  like  to  do  here  is  to
talk  about  three  points  that  cut  across  the  questions  and  the  re-
sponses.

Now, the first is that ISS is critical to biomedical research need-

ed to prepare for exploration beyond low-Earth orbit.

The  second  point  is  that  there  is  a  vibrant  portfolio  that  exist
right  now  in  ground  base  biomedical  research  that  is  maturing  to-
ward flight studies for ISS.

And the third is that biomedical research for exploration leads to
advances  that  enhances  life  on  Earth.  Let  me  talk  about  these
three points in turn.

There is a broad range of human health risks associated with ex-
tended  operations  in  the  microgravity  environment  of  space,  and  I
know  that  Members  are  familiar  with  these  examples  being  accel-
erated  bone  loss,  muscle  atrophy,  changes  in  cardiovascular  func-
tion,  altered  immune  responses,  sensory  motor  adaptations,  issues
concerning habitability, and a variety of other issues. And also how
to deliver medical care, to provide medical capabilities in this envi-
ronment.

We  are  familiar  with  how  imaging  has  impacted  medicine  on
Earth,  the  ability  to  make  accurate  diagnoses,  to  provide  treat-
ment.  During  missions  in  remote  harsh  environments,  whether  on
Earth or in space, it is important to make the best possible assess-
ment in the event of a medical contingency.

Since  treatment  decisions  pertain  not  only  to  the  affected  crew
member but also to the other crew members, the consumables and
possibly  the  mission  itself,  in  a  collaboration  involving  academia,
government,  and  industry,  ultrasound  training  for  non-physician
crew members aboard the ISS has led to several scientific publica-
tions demonstrating the utility of ultrasound for health monitoring
and medical imaging in space.

The  findings  and  subsequent  lessons  learned  unquestionably  re-
quired  ISS  crew  and  resources  could  not  have  been  done  without
ISS,  and  this  project  exemplifies  how  the  ISS  provides  unique  and
invaluable  capabilities.  Their  applications  to  Earth  in  military
medicine,  in  the  ability  to  make  diagnoses  in  remote  settings,  air
ambulances,  and  also  applications  to  sports  medicine,  and  in  fact,
the technologies were used during the last Olympic games.

The  second  point  that  I  wish  to  make  pertains  to  the  way  in
which  the  NASA’s  human  research  program  and  NSBRI  are  work-
ing together. There is a significant portfolio of projects involving 70
universities  in  26  states  that  are  moving  the  way  through  a  pipe-
line of counter-measure and technology development from research
to  development,  to  testing,  to  evaluation,  and  eventual  operational
integradation.  There  is  a  user  panel  of  astronauts,  current  and
former and flight surgeons, who are working together. I agree with
Mr.  Rohrabacher’s  statement  that  there  is  a  need  to  conduct  re-
search on Station. This is why NSBRI was created, from the stand-
point  of  NASA  leveraging  off  the  Nation’s  investment  and  bio-
medical  research  and  being  able  to  move  projects  to  testing  in  the
Space Station.

The third point that I wanted to make concerns the spin-offs, the
first panel eloquently addressed this issue in the context of unique
conditions  of  space,  leading  to  novel  insights  and  discoveries  and
also to spin-offs. And I want to echo the comments of the other wit-
nesses  and  thanking  NASA  and  the  engineers  for  their  ingenuity,
hard  work,  and  expertise  in  making  ISS  a  reality.  There  is  really
an  unprecedented  opportunity  here  from  the  perspective  of  bio-
medical research, and that this endeavor will be collaborative inter-
national and would advance our nation as we build upon our legacy
of innovation, discovery, and leadership.

Thank you very much for your time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEFFREY P. SUTTON

Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member and Distinguished Members of the Subcommittee:
Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  on  the  subject  of  ‘‘NASA’s  International
Space  Station  Program:  Status  and  Issues.’’  Since  2001,  I  have  had  the  privilege  to
serve as the Director of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI),
a  non-profit  consortium  competitively  selected  and  supported  by  NASA  to  address
and develop countermeasures for high-priority biomedical risks associated with long-
duration human exploration of space.

The  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  provides  a  unique,  invaluable  resource  for
the  U.S.  and  its  international  partners  to  conduct  scientific  research,  develop  and

demonstrate  innovative  technologies,  test  and  evaluate  procedures,  protocols  and
products,  and  operationally  integrate  hardware,  software  and  other  components  to
advance  space  exploration  goals.  Designation  of  the  U.S.  segment  of  the  ISS  as  a
National  Laboratory,  as  specified  in  Section  507  of  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of
2005  (Public  Law  109–155),  underscores  the  importance  of  ISS  as  a  facility  for  re-
search and a means to enable exploration.

In  the  ‘‘Vision  for  Space  Exploration,’’  presented  by  President  Bush  on  January
14,  2004,  the  use  of  ISS  to  support  space  exploration  goals  is  highlighted,  with  one
focus  being  to  understand  how  the  space  environment  affects  astronaut  health  and
capabilities  and  to  develop  countermeasures.  The  potential  of  ISS  as  an  essential
platform for biomedical and technology research to support long-term human explo-
ration  of  space  has  been  described  in  several  recent  reports,  including  but  not  lim-
ited to (1) ‘‘Review of NASA Plans for the International Space Station,’’ prepared by
the  National  Research  Council  in  2006,  and  (2)  ‘‘NASA  Report  to  Congress  Regard-
ing  a  Plan  for  the  International  Space  Station  National  Laboratory,’’  submitted  in
May 2007.

It  is  prudent  for  the  U.S.  to  foster  scientific  and  technological  achievements  uti-
lizing the unique attributes of the ISS. Innovation and discovery contribute to Amer-
ican  leadership  and  economic  growth.  Accomplishments  in  space  help  inspire  the
next  generation  of  scientists,  physicians  and  engineers,  support  U.S.  competitive-
ness,  facilitate  partnerships  and  international  cooperation,  and  lead  to  advances
that  enhance  life  on  Earth.  NASA  and  the  Nation  face  many  challenges.  As  con-
struction of the ISS nears completion and three scientific laboratories become oper-
ational,  the  time  is  ripe  to  capitalize  on  our  country’s  investment  in  the  ISS  and
all that it has to offer.

The present hearing examines the status of the ISS and issues related to its oper-
ation  and  utilization,  including  the  planned  and  potential  uses  of  the  ISS  to  meet
both  NASA  and  non-NASA  research  needs.  This  testimony  concerns  itself  with  re-
sponses  to  a  series  of  biomedical  questions  posed  in  the  Subcommittee’s  invitation
letter.
What biomedical research is needed to prepare for exploration beyond low-
Earth orbit?

In  the  47  years  since  the  first  human  flew  in  space,  a  significant  amount  of
knowledge  and  experience  has  been  acquired  relating  to  the  inherent  risks  associ-
ated with human space travel. Missions in low-Earth orbit, especially long-duration
flights  aboard  Skylab,  Mir  and  ISS,  have  given  insights  into  a  broad  range  of
human  health  risks  associated  with  extended  operations  in  the  microgravity  envi-
ronment  of  space.  Accelerated  bone  loss,  muscle  atrophy,  changes  in  cardiovascular
function,  altered  immune  responses  and  sensorimotor  adaptations  occur.  There  are
issues  concerning  proper  nutrition,  human-machine  interfaces  and  habitability,
neuro-behavioral  and  psycho-social  factors,  performance,  sleep  and  chronobiology,
radiation  and  medical  care  capabilities,  including  ineffectiveness  of  medication.
Some  risks,  such  as  dust  from  the  lunar  or  Mars  surfaces,  are  unique  to  missions
beyond  low-Earth  orbit.  Not  all  astronauts  are  affected  equally  by  the  same  risk  or
countermeasure, and individual differences need to be taken into account.

An  understanding  of  the  risks  and  issues  is  critical  to  determining  what  bio-
medical  research  is  needed.  The  Institute  of  Medicine  (IOM)  report,  ‘‘Safe  Passage:
Astronaut  Care  for  Exploration  Missions,’’  released  in  2001,  recommended  that  all
relevant  epidemiological  data  on  astronauts  be  captured,  and  that  a  long-term,  fo-
cused  health  care  research  strategy  be  pursued  concerning  health  risks  and  their
amelioration.

The  Bioastronautics  Roadmap  (http://bioastroroadmap.nasa.gov),  developed  over
the  past  decade  by  NASA  in  collaboration  with  the  external  biomedical  research
community, is consistent with this perspective. The Roadmap provides a framework
for  identifying,  assessing  and  reducing  the  risks  of  crew  exposure  to  the  hazardous
environments of space. It identifies 45 risks and assigns priorities to these for three
reference  missions:  a  one-year  mission  to  the  ISS;  a  month-long  stay  on  the  lunar
surface; and a 30-month round-trip journey to Mars.

NASA  and  its  non-government  organization  partner,  NSBRI,  have  used  the  Bio-
astronautics  Roadmap  as  a  framework  to  build  a  biomedical  research  portfolio  fo-
cused  on  high-priority  areas,  such  as  accelerated  bone  loss,  radiation,  neuro-behav-
ioral  and  psycho-social  factors,  and  exploration  medical  care.  More  recently,  the
partnership has been elucidating a level of detail necessary to prioritize risks across
physiological  disciplines  and  to  compare  strategies  for  how  to  manage  a  given  risk
across mission operational architectures.

Research on the ground and in space is needed to elucidate processes but the im-
portance of accelerating countermeasure and technology development is also critical,

as emphasized in an IOM report released in 2005 entitled ‘‘A Risk Reduction Strat-
egy  for  Human  Exploration  of  Space.’’  To  prepare  for  exploration  beyond  low-Earth
orbit, the report stresses the need to establish safe radiation exposure levels for all
relevant  risks.  This  sentiment  is  echoed  in  a  2008  report  from  the  National  Re-
search  Council  entitled  ‘‘Managing  Space  Radiation  Risk  in  the  New  Era  of  Space
Exploration.’’

By its nature, research needs are dynamic as knowledge about risks matures and
countermeasures  and  other  risk-reduction  strategies  are  implemented.  ISS  as  a  re-
search platform provides an unparalleled resource to define requirements for explo-
ration  needs  and  to  support  research,  development,  testing,  evaluation  and  oper-
ational integration of deliverables to support crew health and well-being.
What progress has been made to date?

Progress  in  biomedical  research  and  development  has  been  made  in  space  and  in
ground-based  investigations.  Skylab,  Space  Shuttle  (including  dedicated  life  science
missions  such  as  STS–90  Neurolab),  free  flyers  and  the  ISS  have  all  pushed  the
frontier  of  biomedical  knowledge  and  technology.  Beginning  with  the  arrival  of  Ex-
pedition 1 to the ISS in November 2000, and extending through the current Expedi-
tion  17  (launched  April  8,  2008  with  an  expected  return  to  Earth  in  October  2008)
and Expedition 18 (expected launch and return in October 2008 and April 2009, re-
spectively)  missions,  NASA  reports  a  series  of  experiments  devoted  to  human  re-
search and countermeasure development for exploration.2

A summary of these experiments with Earth applications follows:

• Bone  and  Muscle  Physiology  in  Space  Experiments  include  research  seeking
to understand the effects space flight on bone loss and muscle fatigue, kidney
stone  prevention,  and  developing  countermeasures,  such  as  the  use  of  medi-
cines  and  exercise.  Potential  Earth  benefits  include  treatments  and/or  cures
for diseases such as osteoporosis and spinal cord injuries.

• Cardiovascular  and  Respiratory  Systems  in  Space  Experiments  include  re-
search  to  understand  orthostatic  intolerance,  decompression  sickness,  and
blood delivery to the brain. Earth applications include improved treatment of
low blood pressure and prevention of cardiac deconditioning.

• Human  Behavior  and  Performance  Experiments  include  research  on  crew
interaction,  understanding  behavioral  issues  and  sleep  cycles.  Earth  applica-
tions  include  improved  treatment  of  insomnia  and  improved  behavioral  per-
formance of people in high-stress situations.

• Immune  System  in  Space  Experiments  include  research  on  developing  new
wound  healing  technologies,  understanding  and  monitoring  immune  system
functions,  and  studying  stress-induced  reactivation  of  viruses.  Earth  applica-
tions include wound and tissue repair techniques that could prevent limb loss
for  military  and  civilian  populations  and  rapid  detection  of  stress-induced  vi-
ruses, such as herpes, and improved treatment.

• Integrated  Physiology  Studies  Experiments  include  research  on  development
of  telemedicine  strategies,  nutrition,  and  archiving  of  biosamples  that  will
provide future research opportunities. Earth applications include remote med-
ical diagnosis and treatment capabilities for rural health care and greater un-
derstanding of nutrition on health.

• Microbiology  in  the  Space  Environment  Experiments  include  research  on  de-
velopment  of  hand-held  technology  to  detect  biological  and  chemical  sub-
stances,  understanding  the  threat  of  pathogens  inside  spacecraft,  and  study-
ing the effect of reduced gravity on pathogens. Earth applications include ad-
vances  in  vaccine  development,  new  treatments  of  drug-resistant  virus
strains, and diagnosis for potential sources of microbial contamination.
• Neurological  and  Vestibular  Systems  in  Space  Experiments  include  research
on facilitating recovery of functional mobility after long-duration space flight,
understanding hand-eye coordination difficulties in space, and studying medi-
cations  to  treat  motion  sickness.  Earth  applications  included  improved  treat-
ment  of  neurological  diseases,  more  effective  motion  sickness  treatment,  and
reduced risk of falling in the elderly.
• Radiation  Studies  Experiments  include  research  on  the  radiation  environ-
ment, effects of radiation on the brain, and assessing the risk of genetic dam-
age  caused  by  radiation.  Earth  applications  include  benefits  for  brain  tumor

treatment,  insight  on  the  origin  of  specific  gene  mutations,  and  improved  ra-
diation protection on military and civilian aircraft crews.

A significant step forward by NASA in implementing an integrated biomedical re-
search  program  to  support  the  long-term  human  presence,  development  and  explo-
ration  of  space  occurred  slightly  more  that  a  decade  ago.  In  1997,  NASA  competi-
tively  awarded,  and  has  funded  in  increments  based  on  performance,  a  cooperative
agreement  (NCC  9–58)  to  the  National  Space  Biomedical  Research  Institute
(www.nsbri.org).  NSBRI  works  in  partnership  with  NASA’s  Human  Research  Pro-
gram, that is part of Advanced Capabilities within the Exploration Mission Systems
Directorate.  NSBRI  leverages  the  Nation’s  substantial  investment  in  biomedical  re-
search  and  brings  unprecedented  intellectual  and  institutional  resources  to  solve
problems for NASA. The focus is on a team approach to developing countermeasures
and deliverables in close collaboration with NASA (see Attachments A and B).

NSBRI is a virtual institute that currently supports approximately 65 coordinated
and  openly  competed  science,  technology  and  education  projects  at  70  universities
in  26  states.  There  is  a  well  established  pipeline  of  products,  maturing  through
countermeasure  and  technology  readiness  levels,  in  preparation  for  flight  testing,
evaluation and, if appropriate, operational integration. Some projects have matured
to  flight,  while  the  bulk  of  the  effort  is  ground-based  and  serves  as  a  source  of  bio-
medical research for the ISS National Laboratory.

As  a  nationally  acclaimed  translational  research  institute,  NSBRI  adds  unique
value  to  NASA’s  Human  Research  Program.  NSBRI  is  governed  by  12  consortium
members,  with  combined  annual  biomedical  funding  in  excess  of  $3B  from  the  Na-
tional  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH).  There  are  strong  productive  collaborations  not
only  with  institutes  within  the  NIH,  in  the  spirit  of  the  recent  NASA–NIH  Memo-
randum  of  Understanding,  but  also  with  programs  within  the  Department  of  De-
fense,  Department  of  Energy,  U.S.  Naval  Academy,  and  other  entities.  More  than
one-third of NSBRI projects actively engage industry, and there is an excellent edu-
cation  and  outreach  program  spanning  elementary  through  high  school,  under-
graduate,  graduate,  and  post-doctoral  education,  and  continuing  medical  education
efforts related to space. There is an eminent Board of Directors (Attachment C) and
active  involvement  of  current  and  former  astronauts  and  flight  surgeons  (Attach-
ment D).

Examples of NSBRI supported science and technology projects include:3

• Understanding  the  harmful  effects  of  space  radiation  in  exacerbating  bone
loss caused by microgravity, with implications on Earth for patients receiving
radiotherapy;
• Investigation  of  pharmacological  countermeasures  to  limit  hand  and  muscle
fatigue in space, with applications on Earth to lessening muscle weakness fol-
lowing injury or surgery;
• Development  and  testing  of  a  needle-free  blood  and  tissue  monitoring  device
for  health  assessment,  science  and  medical  care  in  space,  with  applications
on Earth for use in ambulances, intensive care units, battlefield settings and
monitoring of vascular function in diabetics;
• Research  and  applications  of  blue  light  to  affect  the  human  circadian  pace-
maker,  performance  and  adaptation  to  shifts  in  work  schedule,  with  applica-
tions on Earth to shift work;
• Delivery of a miniaturized time-of-flight mass spectrometer for environmental
monitoring  and  medical  assessment  in  space,  with  applications  for  homeland
security;
• Research,  development,  testing  and  evaluation  (aboard  the  NASA  Extreme
Mission  Operations  underwater  habitat)  of  a  psychomotor  vigilance  test  for
the  objective  assessment  of  fatigue  and  stress  in  mission-critical  activities
(Principal  investigator  awarded  a  NASA  Distinguished  Public  Service  Medal
in 2007);
• Development  of  a  microdosimeter  instrument,  tested  aboard  the  MidSTAR–

• Development and testing of a high-intensity, focused ultrasound technique for
non-invasive,  bloodless  surgery,  with  applications  in  space,  emergency  rooms
and on the battlefield;
• Studies  to  determine  oxygen  requirements  and  means  to  concentrate  oxygen
in hypoxic, harsh environments, with applications on Earth to emergency and
military medicine.

What  role  will  the  International  Space  Station  play  in  addressing  those
questions?

While short-duration flights and ground-based research, including the use of ana-
log  environments,  contribute  to  biomedical  research  for  space  exploration,  the  ISS
provides the only resource with the capabilities to conduct certain types of research
and  to  advance  countermeasures  and  technologies.  There  are  two  immediate  stra-
tegic  goals  the  ISS  can  fulfill  in  the  area  of  biomedical  research  to  address  explo-
ration needs. It will serve as a proving ground for scientific and technological prod-
uct  development  of  deliverables  currently  in  the  pipeline.  These  deliverables  may
address specific standards and requirements. Secondly, access to the ISS would fos-
ter new project opportunities that leverage off the portfolio of projects currently ad-
dressing exploration needs.
What  is  needed  to  maximize  the  utility  of  the  International  Space  Station
for conducting the necessary biomedical research?

Affordable  and  reliable  access  to  and  from  the  ISS  is  key  to  the  success  of  con-
ducting  the  necessary  biomedical  research.  Critical  to  this  access  is  the  availability
of cost-effective transportation services.

Given  adequate  access  to  and  from  ISS,  it  is  essential  to  have  a  robust  manage-
ment  structure  and  leadership  for  conducting  and  integrating  science.  Research
aboard  the  ISS  should  be  of  the  highest  merit,  with  ample  preliminary  work  to  en-
sure  success.  There  should  be  clear  justification  as  to  why  the  ISS  is  the  best,  or
perhaps  only,  laboratory  to  conduct  the  research.  Some  biomedical  research  is  fun-
damental and can only be performed in a microgravity environment. However, much
of  the  necessary  biomedical  investigations  for  space  are  translational.  They  mature
through a pipeline from research, to development, to testing, to evaluation, to oper-
ational  integration.  To  maximize  the  utility  of  the  ISS  in  this  context,  it  is  wise  to
link  the  ISS  National  Laboratory  to  the  full  spectrum  of  space-related  research
being conducted throughout academia, industry and government.

Lastly,  a  countermeasure  advancement  process,  developed  specifically  for  utiliza-
tion of the ISS National Laboratory, would be helpful to facilitate key research mov-
ing  through  the  pipeline  of  development  to  advance  to  validation  in  space.  Such  a
process  will  require  strong  program  oversight  and  management  rigor  to  assess  the
operational  need  and  feasibility  of  the  research,  thereby  maximizing  the  return  on
investment.
What,  if  any,  critical  enabling  biomedical  research  for  exploration  cannot
be  done  on  the  International  Space  Station  and  will  have  to  be  addressed
by other means?

While many areas of biomedical research for exploration would benefit from access
to the ISS, some research is not suitable for ISS and needs to be addressed by other
means. Four examples follow:
Radiation  Studies—Studies  toward  countermeasure  development  against  the  acute
and  chronic  effects  of  radiation  cannot  be  fully  conducted  in  low-Earth  orbit,  given
the presence of the Van Allen belts. The radiation spectrum beyond low-Earth orbit
can  be  emulated  utilizing  beams  of  high-energy  heavy  ions,  such  as  those  found  at
Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Long-duration  Exposure  to  Reduced  Gravity—The  effects  of  microgravity  on  the
body  during  long-duration  missions  are  well  documented  (e.g.,  approximately  one
percent bone loss per month). However, the effects of long-term exposure to reduced
gravity  are  not  known.  Gravity  on  the  Moon  is  one-sixth  of  Earth’s  gravity  and  on
Mars it is three-eighths of Earth’s gravity. There are many open questions, such as
whether  extra-vehicular  activities  in  these  gravitational  environments  obviate  the
need for supplemental exercise countermeasures.
Lunar  Dust—Dust,  such  as  on  the  Moon,  poses  an  environmental  risk  that  could
result  in  mechanical  failures  in  spacesuits  and  airlocks.  Lunar  dust  is  exceedingly
small,  making  it  easy  to  get  deep  into  the  lungs.  The  dust  is  littered  with  bonded
shards of glass and minerals known as agglutinates, which have not been found on
Earth. It is not known whether they can be expelled efficiently if inhaled.

Medical  Emergency  Management—Through  the  use  of  a  high-fidelity  patient  simu-
lator,  astronauts  and  ground  personnel  involved  in  mission  operations  can  practice
management  of  medical  emergencies.  Ground-based  simulation  of  medical  contin-
gencies  complements  activities  to  advance  medical  care  capabilities  that  could  be
tested and evaluated aboard the ISS.

In closing, as ISS construction nears completion, there is an unprecedented oppor-
tunity  to  conduct  biomedical  and  other  research,  and  to  test  and  validate  critical
technologies  for  human  exploration  of  space.  This  endeavor  will  be  collaborative,
international and will advance our nation as we build upon our legacy of innovation,
discovery and leadership.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  UDALL.  I  thank  the  panel  for  that  very  important  set

of presentations.

We  are  going  to  move  right  now  to  the  first  round  of  questions.

I am going to recognize myself for five minutes.

COST OF ISS OPERATIONS

I  want  to  start  with  Mr.  Gerstenmaier.  In  the  interest  of  clari-
fication, I wanted to ask you how much will the taxpayer, our tax-
payers  invest  in  the  Station,  including  Shuttle  flights?  There  were
some  comments  made  in  the  previous  panels  about  the  numbers.
I want to make sure we had the correct number for the record.

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Are  you  talking  about  the  basic  Space  Sta-

tion sustaining an operations budget on an annual——

Chairman  UDALL.  I  am  talking  about  all,  I  think  the  capital
costs,  the  operational  costs.  There  was  a  number  of  $100  billion
mentioned  in  the  last  panel.  I  am  not  sure  that  is  correct,  and  I
wanted to at least——

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  I  would  like  to  take  that  question  for  the
record  so  we  can  get  the  details  of  what  goes  into  that.  There  is
a  range  of  numbers  that  sits  out  there,  and  I  would  like  to  get  a
common basis and provide a detail.

Chairman  UDALL.  That  would  be  helpful  to  the  Committee,  and
if you would include the Shuttle flights, I think, in total. You could
break those out, it would be useful.

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  And  we  can  include  that  with  transpor-
tation,  with  all  the  various  pieces  in  there  so  then  you  could  see
what  the  investment  is.  But  it  would  be,  it  is  much  better  to  do
written than——

Chairman UDALL. I would agree.

LOGISTICS FLIGHTS

Let  me  continue  questioning  Mr.  Gerstenmaier.  I  wanted  to  fol-
low  up  on  your  statement  that  the  approach  will,  to  the  Shuttle
will, to the Station, I should say, will require living off spares flown
up by the Shuttle and taking some limited degradation and ISS ca-
pabilities if there is a delay in the commercial services.

In  your  engineering  judgment,  how  do  you  pinpoint  to  analyze
the  contingency  of  logistics  flights  to  bring  critical  spares  to  the
ISS? Are they needed? If so, why?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Again,  we  have  two  contingency  flights  that
sits in our manifest. Those flights deliver critical spares as you de-
scribed,  and  the  purpose  of  those  spares  are  essentially  to  give  us
some margin if the commercial re-supply services are delayed a lit-
tle bit, those spares are in place, so if a component fails, that crit-
ical  component  has  a  ready  spare  available  on  station  to  go  ahead
and replace it.

It  allows  the  commercial  re-supply  sector  to  be  a  little  bit  later
in their delivery. So I consider those flights to be critical to us, very
important for us.

We also are monitoring actively what components are failing, and
we  are  going  to  change  kind  of  in  real  time  exactly  what  compo-
nents we put on those flights. So we have a candidate list of things
we would like to fly today, but we reserve the right to change that
around  a  little  bit  after  we  see  how  the  actual  hardware  operates.
And  we  have  just  activated  a  lot  of  our  systems  on  the  outside
of  Space  Station.  We  are  getting  more  runtime  on  the  equipment,
learning  how  to  balance  that,  and  we  will  position  the  proper
spares  that  will  give  us  the  most  longevity  of  Space  Station  to
allow research to occur.

Chairman  UDALL.  Could  you  speak  further  to  the  risk,  the  level

of risk that we incur if we didn’t fly those two Shuttle flights?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. It is difficult to quantify exactly. It is a func-
tion  of  how  this,  the  current  equipment  operates  and  how  well  it
performs.  We  see  some  components  do  very  well,  actually  operate
much  longer  than  we  have  anticipated.  We  have  seen  some  not
work quite as well. The beta gimble, a large motor that rotates that
tracks  the  sun  with  the  outboard  rays,  and  then  there  is  a  large
alpha joint, a big joint about 10 foot diameter, a steel ring that ro-
tates  that  has  some  degradation  in  it.  We  are  probably  going  to
have  to  make  some  changes  there.  The  control  moment  gyros  that
provide  attitude  to  station,  it  was  supposed  to  last  about  eight
years. We have lost two of those in two or three years.

So there is significant degradation in some components but then
other components have run much longer than we have anticipated.
Our judgment has to be how do you anticipate what those failures
are,  place  them  on  the  Shuttle,  and  then  that  gives  us  the
robustness to continue.

Chairman UDALL. Are those flights a part of the manifest?
Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Those  flights  are,  we  treat  them  as  part  of
the manifest. They are shown there. We don’t have approval to fly
those yet. We still need to seek approval to do that. They are budg-
eted, and we are planning those actively to be in the manifest, but

they need to occur. We need to justify that they need to occur. Then
they need to occur before the——

Chairman  UDALL.  Any  back-up  plan  if  we  weren’t  to  fly  those

two logistic flights?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Again,  if  for  some  reason  those  flights  had
to be dropped for some reason or they didn’t occur for some reason
or  we  weren’t  approved,  given  approval  to  fly  those,  we  would  an-
ticipate what hardware we lose and then we would, again, provide
back  to  the  community  the  risks  associated  with  not  having  those,
that hardware based on the latest data at that time, and we would
make an informed judgment about what we should do.

Chairman UDALL. Ms. Chaplain, do you care to comment?
Ms.  CHAPLAIN.  I  agree  with  what  has  been  said.  I  would  also
comment  that  if  this  does  get  pushed  off  to  when  the  COTS  vehi-
cles are available, they might not necessarily have that kind of ca-
pability to take up some of these larger spares, and that would also
constrain  their  ability  to  carry  other  things  up  to  the  Station,  and
that is already a tight area right now.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you for that insight.
I  see  my  time  is  expired.  I  want  to  recognize  Congressman  Hall

for five minutes.

Mr. HALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, you mentioned the risks if we didn’t fly those two
flights,  and  I  am  sure  you  are  talking  about  the  flights  that  they
have  said  they  intend  to  fly.  We  just  don’t  know  their  status.  I
think you pretty well straightened that out.
SOYUZ SAFETY ISSUES

I  guess  my  question  is  what  if  we  do  fly  some  flights,  and  Mr.
Gerstenmaier,  with  NASA’s  reliance  on  Soyuz  during  the  five-year
gap  and  could  you  provide  us  with  the  details  of  the  two  previous
re-entry  problems?  And  I  think  I  was  one  of  the,  among  the  first
to  insist  on  some  escape  module  money  for  the  four  birds,  and  I
was always told it was either too heavy or too expensive. I couldn’t
accept too expensive, but too heavy I had to accept it.

But  we  have  that  in  the  new  bird  that  is  coming  along,  and  so
I  think  reliability  and  safety  are  as  much  as  what  if  we  don’t  fly
them  that  I  am  interested  in.  I  guess  if  you  give  us  the  details  of
the  two  previous  re-entry  problems  and  what  actions  are  being
taken  by  the  Russians  to  ensure  the  continued  safety  and  reli-
ability of Soyuz and is Soyuz a safe vehicle, and what insight does
NASA have into the Soyuz Program?

In five minutes.
Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Okay.  I  have  talked  a  little  bit  about  both
of  those  flights.  Both  of  the  flights  had  a  ballistic  entry  on  the
Soyuz  vehicle  and  by  ballistic  entry  instead  of  the  Soyuz  actively
flying  and  controlling  the  trajectory  with  the  lift  vector  pointed  in
a  specific  direction,  it  essentially  just  spins  the  capsule  much  like
a  bullet  coming  out  of  a  rifle  shell,  and  then  essentially  provides
stability for the Soyuz and ends up significantly shorter in location
on  the  Earth  where  it  lands  on  the  trajectory,  but  it  is  stable  in
the sense that it is on track. It is just short by 400 kilometers, and
that is what we saw in both of these cases.

101

It  also  appears  that  on  both  of  these  Soyuz  vehicles  we  saw  a
failure  of  the  instrumentation  module  and  propulsion  module  to
separate  from  the  Soyuz  vehicle.  When  the  Soyuz  departs  from
Space  Station,  it  does  a  de-orbit  burn,  removes  velocity  from  the
spacecraft. It starts to re-enter then goes into an attitude in the or-
bital  section,  comes  off,  and  the  propulsion  and  instrumentation
section also comes off and then it is just a little return capsule that
returns.

It  appears  that  that  lower  section  did  not  properly  release.  We
saw that, the Russians saw that, and they showed us the data that
conclusively  that  that  was  still  attached.  We  had  telemetry  going
across  a  cable  that  should  have  severed  when  that  came  loose.  So
we know for sure on the previous Soyuz that that occurred.

On  the  most  recent  one  it  is  subjecture  that  that  has  occurred.
We need to get the capsule back to Moscow to understand that. The
Russians  will  do  that.  The  Russians  have  given  us  very  good  in-
sight into their program. They understand the risk of what is going
on. They are as concerned as we are about this event. The fact that
we  have  similar  occurrences  of  something  that  we  thought  we  un-
derstood  on  two  vehicles  calls  into  question  some  design  problems
or  maybe  a  manufacturing  change,  something  has  changed  in  the
vehicles.  The  Russians  will  work  that.  They  performed  an  inde-
pendent commission. They will provide us with the results of that.
We  will,  before  we  use  the  Soyuz  for  any  other  critical  activities,
we  will  make  sure  we  have  looked  at  the  safety,  we  have  looked
at  what  we  understand  from  this  event  that  occurred,  and  we  will
make  sure  that  we  understand  the  risks  that  is  going  forward  to
our crews.

Mr.  HALL.  With  that  I  thank  you.  I  want  to  ask  you  one  other
quick  question.  You  may  have  to  answer  it  in  writing  if  I  don’t
have the time.

EXCEPTION TO INKSNA

As  you  well  know,  in  order  for  NASA  to  continue  buying  Soyuz
spacecraft  from  the  Russians  during  the  upcoming  so-called  gap,
Congress has to provide a new exception to the Iran, North Korea,
Syria,  Nonproliferation  Act  called  INKSNA,  and  that  is  a  place
where  your  recommendations  and  of  these  two  groups  here  and
Congress  have  to  come  together,  and  we  have  to  do  something  to-
gether.

What  would  be  the  consequences  if  this  Congress  were  to  fail  to
provide that exception this year? And would NASA be able to place
a  timely  order  with  the  Russians  if  legislative  relief  were  provided
by say next spring?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  We  really  need  that  relief  now  so  we  can
complete the negotiations with the Russians. The time that we un-
derstand  and  the  Russians  have  provided  to  us,  which  we  agree
with, is about three years to have those vehicles manufactured. We
need  to  get  those  contracts  in  place.  We  need  that  relief  this  sum-
mer  so  we  can  complete  those  negotiations  and  have  the  vehicle
there.

They are mandatory for us to keep a U.S. crew presence on-board
Space  Station.  We  need  a  U.S.  crew  presence  on-board  Space  Sta-
tion to operate the U.S. segments. The U.S. segment then provides

power, cooling, water, air circulation for the other partner modules,
including  some  of  the  Russian  segments.  So  we  need  a  U.S.  pres-
ence  there  to  maintain  the  Space  Station  so  we  need  our  crew
members  there.  The  only  way  to  get  them  there  when  the  Shuttle
retires,  initially  is  the  Soyuz  vehicle.  So  we  need  that  relief.  It  is,
and it is mandatory this summer.

Mr.  HALL.  And  another  alternative  is  that  we  might  have  to
abandon  the  ISS.  We  don’t  want  to  do  that.  And  the  affect  it  has
on our international partners. It is very, very important.

I thank and I yield back my time.
Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Congressman Hall.
The Chair recognizes Congressman Lampson.

ALPHA-MAGNETIC SPECTROMETER

Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I may sound like a broken record, Mr. Gerstenmaier, when I talk
about  the  AMS,  the  Alpha-Magnetic  Spectrometer,  but  that  is  one
of  the  things  that  there  has  been  a  great  deal  of  hope  that  would
go  to  the  International  Space  Station.  And  presently  it  does  not
have a location on the manifest for a Shuttle flight.

So  I  hope,  first  of  all,  that  the  two  so-called  contingency  flights
so,  indeed,  get  funded  and  are  made  to  happen.  I  think  they  are
critically important.

But is there a possibility first that the AMS can go up on a Shut-
tle before we end the use of the Shuttle Program? And I guess be-
yond that, what other experiment, either facilities or hardware that
have  been  developed  to  support  research  investigations,  have  been
completed but are not planned for a flight? And what, if any, plans
does  NASA  have  to  fly  that  hardware  to  the  ISS,  free  flyers  or
other microgravity platforms?

Is  there  a  lot?  And  who  has  participated  in  those  things?  Can

you elaborate some on that for me?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Yes.  In  terms  of  the  AMS,  right  now  we
don’t  see  a  spot  in  the  current  Shuttle  manifest  remaining  ten
flights to fly the AMS, and that is because of the discussion we just
had  on  the  criticality  of  the  spares.  The  problem  is  if  I  took  those
spares off and replaced it with AMS, then I have hurt the basic in-
frastructure  that  is  needed  on-board  Space  Station  to  support  the
AMS.

So in other words, AMS needs power, it needs data, it needs cool-
ing.  If  I  don’t  fly  the  spares  that  could  provide  power,  data,  and
cooling  and  have  to  take  those  off  for  AMS,  then  AMS  is  on-orbit,
but it may not be able to be supported by Space Station.

So I need those flights to fly the spares.
Mr.  LAMPSON.  But  now  those  don’t  include  the  two  contingency

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  No.  Those  two  contingency  flights  are  for

flights?

those spares I just described.

don’t have a place for the AMS.

Mr. LAMPSON. They are full. So even beyond the contingencies we

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Not  in  the  existing  manifest  with  those  two

contingencies.

Mr. LAMPSON. What if——
Mr. GERSTENMAIER. There is not room.

Mr.  LAMPSON.—what  about  the  other  facilities  and  experiments

and such?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  The  other  facilities,  I  don’t  think  there  is
any facility that is actually on the ground ready to be flown. There
are  ones  that  have  been  cancelled  earlier  like  the  large  centrifuge
module  that  was  talked  about  earlier.  That  was  cancelled  very
early in its development phase or not very early but in its develop-
ment phase, and it is in nowhere ready condition to go fly.

We  do  have  many  facilities  scheduled  on  the  remaining  Shuttle
flights on the multi-purpose logistics flights. There is a combustion
rack  that  is  going  to  go  up.  There  is  a  window  observation  facility
that will fly.

So the basic research racks that were originally designed are still
present on the manifest, and they are still there. Our goal is to out-
fit  Space  Station  with  the  best  racks  we  could  to  provide  a  wide
variety of research capability for Space Station, and that is the goal
we are still on, and we still have plans for those equipment.

But I will take it for the record to go investigate a little bit deep-
er  to  see  if  there  is  anything  that  is  completed  that  is  not  getting
to fly. But my recollection is there is none.

Mr. LAMPSON. But is it worth this Congress giving consideration
to  the  additional  money  necessary  to  get  those  things,  even  if  it  is
just down to the AMS, and I think there are some other things re-
lated and otherwise. Is it worth our country to look at the potential
investment  necessary  for  the  hope  of  the  return  that  would  come
from these things?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. Again, that is tough for me to pass judgment
on.  I  am  an  engineer  who  builds  the  basic  laboratory.  I  think  it
would  be  better  posed  to  the  scientists  and  the  researchers  associ-
ated with AMS than to myself.

Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you. Thank you for that. The candor. I ap-
preciate it. I really think that we have set some unfortunate policy
along  the  way,  and  we  really  have  been  shortsighted  on  a  number
of things that we have done. Perhaps if we would have finished the
crew  return  vehicle  when  we  did  the  X-38,  if  you  all  remember
that, that we shut down prematurely, we were at the end of its de-
velopment, and we actually spent more money to shut it down than
we  would  have  to  fly  it.  And  perhaps  that  could  have  been  used
today to have been the crew return, I mean, crew exchange vehicle.
So  I  hope  that  we  are  getting  our  ducks  lined  up  properly.  I
would  sure  like  for  us  to  give  consideration  as  this  panel  and  as
a  Congress  to  what  we  can  do  to  identify  other  of  those  pieces  of
hardware, and I think we also have to consider what we have done
as  far  as  relationship  is  concerned  of  the  nations  that  spend  more
than  a  billion  dollars  just  on  that  one  project,  for  us  to  renege  on
our promise to help put it up there to completion.

Mr. Chairman, I wanted to editorialize there at the end.
Mr. HALL. Would the gentleman yield just one moment?
Mr. LAMPSON. I would indeed.
Mr. HALL. Part of the problem is the expectations of a lot of uni-
versities that have put considerable work and requests in and were
promised certain things on certain flights——

Mr. LAMPSON. Yeah.

Mr.  HALL.—that  have  not  been  flown.  Where  it  is  important  to
go  with  our  international  allies,  it  is  also  important  to  keep  the
word  with  the  universities.  That  is  the  reason  we  need  these  two
flights  if  we  can  get  them.  Texas  A  &  M  being  one  in  particular
that you are very interested in protecting.

Mr. LAMPSON. Absolutely.
Mr. HALL. And I yield back my time.
Mr.  LAMPSON.  And  reclaiming  my  time.  Thank  you  very  much.
I think it is critically important for our reputation among other na-
tions  of  the  world  and  if  we  are  going  to  entice  countries  to  want
to  work  with  us  on  other  science-related  activities,  that  if  we  say
we  are  going  to  do  something,  we  ought  to  keep  our  word.  We
ought to do it. And I guarantee you that when we make that com-
mitment,  the  return  to  us  is  going  to  be  no  different  than  what  it
was  during  the  Apollo  years.  We  will  get  so  much  back,  more  or
beyond the investment that we make to make those things happen.
It will be extremely worth our while.

I  hope  and  pray  that  we  don’t  lose  our  position  to  other  nations

in this space race.

I yield back my time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Lampson. It has been said you
give  two  Texans  a  lever,  you  can  move  the  world.  We  are  going  to
continue to try to find you all a lever, so you can do so.

The Chair recognizes Congressman Rohrabacher for five minutes.

RUSSIAN COOPERATION AND CAPABILITIES

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Maybe you could tell us about the willingness
now  of  the  Russians  and  their  cooperation  to  meet  the  challenges
that the Space Station, or excuse me, the retirement of the Shuttle,
are going to present? Is there a willingness on the part of the Rus-
sians or a lack of willingness on the part of the Russians to expand
our cooperation to make up for that loss?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. I think we have really come to work together
as  an  international  partnership.  When  we  had  the  Columbia  trag-
edy and the Shuttle was lost, and we lost our transportation capa-
bility to Space Station for a temporary period of time, the Russians
rose  to  that  challenge  and  provided  us  with  Soyuz  vehicles  and
Progress vehicles that essentially kept Space Station viable during
that period. So during those two years when we were not flying the
Shuttle, if it were not for the Russians and their support to us, we
would not have had a Space Station.

As  we  go  to  the  future,  they  need  our  crew  on-board  Space  Sta-
tion  as  much  as  anyone  does  because  I  described,  you  know,  we
provide power to their segment, and we provide attitude control for
the  entire  Space  Station,  which  saves  them  propellant.  We  have
many  synergistic  things  that  we  share  with  them  back  and  forth,
so  they  need  our  U.S.  crew  presence  there.  They  recognize  they
can’t maintain the U.S. segment on their own.

So  they  will  help  us  in  that  venture,  but,  again,  they  are  going
to  want  compensation  in  terms  of  financial  contract  with  us,  and
we will work with them to work out the details.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Are  they  capable  of  delivering  spare  parts
and  the  other  type  of  things  that  are  necessary  to  maintain  the
Station?

105

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  They  are  capable  of  delivering  the  spares
needed for their segment and to keep it operating. For our segment
we will use the commercial re-supply services to deliver those com-
ponents  to  Space  Station  for  our  equipment  that  needs  to  be——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. If it is, we don’t have that capability now.
Mr. GERSTENMAIER. We do not have that capability now. We can
also  use  the  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  that  the  Europeans  are
building and the Japanese are building an——

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Which  they  don’t  have  the  capability  now.
The only people now who have got the capability are the Russians.
Is that correct?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  No.  The  ATV  recently  docked  to  Space  Sta-
tion.  We  brought  it  up  so  we  have  proven  at  least  one  time  that
that is a good capacity. It performed exactly the way it should. We
flew  it  in  within  10  meters,  backed  it  back  out,  flew  it  back  and
successfully docked, and it is viable.

The Japanese have a full up test, propulsion test article they are

test firing in Japan. Their vehicle is scheduled to fly next year.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  But  this  is,  I  am  talking  about  something

that is online, not something that we have done once.

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. The thing that is online is the ATV.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay.  And  so  that  will,  that  capability  will
permit  us  then  once  the  Shuttle  is  retired,  to  deliver  these  spares
that we need?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. We are going to need a combination of serv-
ices when the Shuttle is retired. We are going to need the ATV, the
HTV, and commercial re-supply.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. Let me note that to the degree that we
are not, that we have been shortsighted, and to the degree that we
have been shortsighted in some of the decisions that we have been
making,  number  one,  we,  of  course,  it  was  hard  to  project  that  we
would lose Shuttles as we have. And also let me just note that Con-
gress,  this  body  here,  this  committee  no  differently,  and  others
have been unwilling to prioritize. It is not that there is not enough
money being spent. It is just we have not prioritized what spending
would  be,  so  whatever  it  is  that  we  are  lacking,  I  think  that  we
could trace it back to the fact that there are things that we are un-
able  to  say  no  to  that  should  have  less  priority  than,  for  example,
the successful completion of this space station mission, this project
that we endeavored to move forward on 20 years ago.

ADDITIONS TO THE ISS

We heard about today microscopic imaging and storage would be
two  things  that  would  be  added  that  would  help  us  be,  utilize  this
great asset to a way that we could actually achieve more.

Are  there  any  thoughts  of  what  it  would  cost  to  provide  that  to

the Station?

Mr. GERSTENMAIER. We have a micro, we have a minus 80 degree
freezer  that  is  currently  on-board  Space  Station  that  can  provide
I believe the cold storage. We need to talk to Dr. Nickerson and un-
derstand exactly what her needs are.

We  also  have  some  small  centrifuges,  not  large,  but  small,  that
may provide some other information that she could use. So we have
some  dialogue  I  think  we  need  to  have  with  her  and  her  needs  to

see  what  is  already  available.  They  may  not  be  our  equipment.
They  may  be  European  equipment  or  maybe  Japanese  equipment
that  we  have  access  to.  We  need  to  work  with  the  Committee  to
make  sure  we  understand  what  their  needs  are  and  see  what  is
available.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  And  indeed,  if  these  things  will,  if  there  are
additions  to  the  Space  Station,  that  will  have  great  value  as  we
heard  from  Mr.  Pickens  today.  There  is  a  great  value  to  be
achieved  from  what  we  have  constructed.  Now,  if  by  adding  a  cou-
ple million dollars of a piece of equipment here or there to achieve
billions  of  dollars  worth  of  return,  it  would  seem  to  me  that  we
need to codify that and to go down and understand it and perhaps
even the private sector might be interested in investing a $10 mil-
lion  piece  of  equipment  or  something  like  that  that  cost  a  certain
amount  to  put  it  on  the  Station.  If  there  is  going  to  be  a  return
from  the  private  sector,  maybe  these  private  sector  entities  might
even be willing to invest in that.

We should be thinking creatively out of the box and especially we

should be thinking about how we can work with the Russians.

Oh,  we  have  another  round  of  questions,  so  that  is,  but  we
should be thinking of a way we could work with the Russians con-
structively.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  will  be  visiting  Russia  at  the  end  of  May,  and
I am meeting with their space people, also meeting with the space
people  in  Berlin,  and  any  type  of  guidance  that  NASA  would  like
to throw in my direction as to what we can do to try to further the
cooperative  spirit  that  would  be  mutually  beneficial,  I  am  open  to
suggestions.

So thank you very much.
Chairman  UDALL.  I  thank  the  gentleman.  I  would  note  that  we
have  about  10  minutes  left.  We  have  to  vacate  the  hearing  room
around  12:30  to  prepare  for  another  hearing  at  1:00.  That  will
leave  us  10  minutes  of  a  round  of  questions  from  the  Chair  and
from the Ranking Member if he so desires.

Let  me  turn—so  the  Chair  does  recognize  himself  for  five  min-

utes.

INKSNA AMENDMENT

Let  me  go  back  to  what  Chairman  Hall  mentioned.  Mr.
Gerstenmaier, NASA’s amendment would remain in effect until the
end of the International Space Station’s life. What would be the im-
pact  if  a  shorter  time  period  were  written  into  the  statute,  for  ex-
ample, January, 2016?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  We  have  two  aspects  we  need.  We  need  the
crew  transportation,  and  we  need  that  until  either  a  commercial
capability  comes  on  line  or  our  CRV  comes  on  line,  and  we  could
no longer need that exception after those vehicles are available.

For other small things such as docking mechanisms, some of our
toilet  activities,  those  kind  of  things  that  we  purchased  from  the
Russians,  we  need  some  small  sustaining  stuff.  We  do  some  small
engineering  studies  with  the  Russians.  Those  kind  of  activities
need to be around for the life of Space Station.

So  they  are  small.  They  are  very  low-dollar  value,  but  there  are
some  engineering  analysis,  studies  sustaining  engineering  kind  of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00110 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

107

thing  that  need  to  be  there  throughout  the  life  of  Station.  So  we
have  tried  to  structure  our  language  such  that  it  meets  those  two
requirements.  It  ends  when  we  no  longer  need  the  capability,  but
the exception continues for those other small items that are needed
for the life of Station.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  need  to  pursue  this  line  of  questioning  fur-
ther.  The  proposed  amendment  would  exclude  from  the  exception
any  payments  for  crew  transportation  or  rescue  services  provided
by Soyuz vehicle once, number one, the U.S. Orion crew exploration
vehicle  reaches  full  operational  capability,  or  a  U.S.  commercial
provider of crew transportation rescue service demonstrates the ca-
pability to meet ISS requirements.

When do you envision full operational capability for the CEV ve-

hicle?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  I  think  our  current  planning  shows  it  being
in  2016,  or  so.  The  first  flights  are  in  2015,  and  then  about  one
year  of  other  things  until  we  get  to  full  operational  capability.  I
know that is at the end of the Space Station life, but we would see
how that comes about.

We are looking at some things to see if there is some things that
we  can  do  to  advance.  We  have  some  internal  schedules  that  are
looking—we will see how that plays out. And commercial, it is real-
ly  probably  better  asked  to  the  commercial  sector  what  they  think
their schedules are for this.

Chairman  UDALL.  Regarding  the  possibility  of  U.S.  commercial
crew  transportation  and  rescue  services,  what  specifically  would
those providers need to demonstrate to meet the provision? I know
you  have  spoken  to  that,  but  I  want  to  make  sure  we  are  as  clear
as possible for the record.

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Again,  I  think  the  recent  Soyuz  experience
has  shown  us  how  difficult  this  environment  is  we  are  flying  in.
This return was, you know, the Shuttle, the Soyuz vehicle has been
around  for  30  years  or  so.  This  is  a  tough  environment  going  from
17,000  miles  an  hour  down  to  zero  landing  on  the  Earth.  And  it
is  not  trivial.  They  need  to  show  us  that  there  is  robustness  in
their  systems  designed  to  take  and  accomplish  that  re-entry,  that
it is safe to return. They need to show us that they can stay docked
on-board  Space  Station  for  a  six-month  period,  and  then  perform
that re-entry exercise.

So  there  is  many  engineering  assessments  and  evaluations  that
we need to see, as we would for our own vehicle to make sure that
the  vehicle  is  really  viable  in  performing  the  design  it  wants,  and
it can safely transport our crew to and from Station.

Chairman  UDALL.  Amendment  would  also  allow  NASA  to  obtain
ancillary goods and services from Russia in addition to crew trans-
port  and  rescue.  Just  how  important  is  it  for  NASA  to  be  able  to
purchase  unique  tools  from  Russia,  and  would  the  safe  operation
of  the  Station  be  in  jeopardy  if  those  services  were  not  available?
Mr. GERSTENMAIER. Those services are extremely important to us
or are mandatory for us. There are in a whole variety of areas. We
use an air-safe pump that actually pumps down the atmosphere of
our air lock to go do space walks. That is a Russian-provided pump.
We  need  to  keep  that  up  and  operating  so  we  can  continue  to  use
the air lock to go out and do space walks.

So  and  there  is  a  variety  of  components  I  can  give  you  that  are
small  but  are  Russian  provided  that  need  to  be  there  for  the  life
of the Station. So I would say that that is critical to the long-term
viability of Space Station.

Chairman  UDALL.  NASA  has  indicated  that  relief  through  the
life of the ISS may be necessary even after a U.S. commercial capa-
bility  is  available  because  some  potential  providers  have  Russian
contractors, Russian-supplied hardware, or other relationships with
the Russian entities that could trigger INKSA’s extraordinary pay-
ment prohibition.

Would you provide any specifics?
Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  Some  of  the  potential  bidders  for  the  com-
mercial  re-supply  services,  they  use  Russian  components,  they  use
Russian  engines,  and  they  would,  I  think  be  subject  to  the  INKSA
legislation,  so  they  are  going  to  need  relief  in  that  same  manner.
So  some  of  these  things,  even  Atlas  V  uses  an  RD–180  engine  un-
derneath  it.  If  that  becomes  one  of  the  options  for  the  commercial
re-supply that gets bid back to us in this request for proposal, then
that  would  potentially  fall  under  this  INKSA  restriction,  and  they
would require relief as well.

SOYUZ LANDING PROBLEMS

Chairman  UDALL.  I  have  completed  this  line  of  questions.  I
would,  I  just  have  a  few  second.  I  wanted  to,  kind  of  a  personal
interest.  You  talked  about  the  Soyuz  landing  400  kilometers  short
of the designated landing area. This is on the plains of Cossack, the
high steppes. I couldn’t help but think about Colorado. If you land-
ed  400  miles,  400  kilometers  short  of  the  landing  zone,  you  have
1,400  foot  peaks  on  the  western  side  of  Colorado,  about  400  kilo-
meters  from  where  I  think  you  would  try  and  land.  That  could
cause  an  additional  problem,  but  in  the  high  steppes  you  have  a
lot of open terrain I assume.

Could you identify the situation for me a bit more?
Mr. GERSTENMAIER. There is a lot of land that is open.
Chairman  UDALL.  And  I  know  you  were  just  there,  so  you  can

speak from personal experience.

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  It  is  not  nearly  as  pretty  as  the  mountains
of Colorado, but it is nice for landing. It is nice and flat, and there
is  not  much  out  there.  I  think  there  is  one  power  line.  They  did
land  near  some  farmers  that  were  burning  some  grass  off  the
steppes, which added a little more interest.

Chairman UDALL. Yes. The story was the astronaut team opened
the  hatch,  peered  out,  and  immediately  closed  the  hatch  again  as
this fire moved toward them. Is that right?

Mr.  GERSTENMAIER.  That  is  true.  They  saw  the  burning,  and  we
are  still  not  sure  exactly  what  caused  the  burning.  The  parachute
itself  was  consumed.  It  appears  that  it  blew  down  into  an  area
where  the  grass  had  been  previously  burned,  and  the  parachute
caught on fire. The crew saw the fire, closed the hatch, waited until
the fire extinguished itself, and then opened the hatch. And by that
time  the  Cossack  farmers  in  the  area  were  there  to  help  the  crew
and assist them——

Chairman UDALL. Thank you for that——
Mr. GERSTENMAIER.—exiting the spacecraft.

Chairman UDALL.—narrative. We have about five minutes left. I
want  to  recognize  the  Ranking  Member  for  five  minutes  to  wrap
things  up  from  his  point  of  view,  and  then  we  will  conclude  the
hearing.

Mr. HALL. Thank you, sir, and I will take the five minutes. I just

want to compliment this group here. Thank you very much.

You  know,  I  have  counted  one,  two,  three,  four,  five,  six,  seven,
eight,  nine  past  Chairman  of  this  committee,  and  I  have  worked
with  seven  of  them.  I  think  the  one  I  didn’t  work  with  was  Olin
Tiger  Teague,  who  first  started  really  the  NASA  thrust.  And  my
kids  think  I  was  here  with  Overton  Brooks,  but  I  wasn’t  here  in
the teens.

But I want to recognize Mr. Gerstenmaier. You have carried out
the book on you. You are the best doggone NASA program manager
we  have  ever  had,  and  I  want  to  thank  you  and  thank  for  your,
for the gifts of all three of you and the other members.

I yield back my time. Thank you, sir.
Chairman UDALL. I thank the Ranking Member.
The  previous  panel,  Judge  Hall  talked  about  longevity  of  the
human lifespan and the health challenges we face, but I think they
ought to put you in the program to find out why you are so robust
and  so  engaged  and  so  energetic.  We  may  not  need  to  know  more
from outer space if we can study you.

Mr.  HALL.  You  know,  if  the  dean  of  the  United  States  House  of

Representatives is the oldest, I am the dean.

Chairman UDALL. You are the dean in my book.
Mr. HALL. And I run three miles every morning, do about 50 sit-
ups,  and  I  can  outwork  any  of  the  rest  of  those  guys  over  there.
Chairman UDALL. I should probably leave it there. I think Judge
Hall,  though,  probably  meets  the  requirement.  My  father-in-law
lived  to  be  90,  and  I  asked  him  for  his  secret.  He  used  to  like  to
drink a little wine, eat a little chocolate, but he got up every morn-
ing  and  walked  two  or  three  miles  and  worked  out,  and  he  said,
my  secret  is  everything  in  moderation,  including  moderation,  and
I think maybe that fits what I know of Judge Hall.

Again,  on  a  less  serious  note,  I  want  to  thank  all  the  witnesses
for  being  here  today.  This  is  very,  very  important  testimony,  help-
ful to the Committee as we move forward.

If there is no objection, the record will remain open for additional
statements  from  the  Members  and  for  answers  to  any  follow-up
questions the Subcommittee may ask of the witnesses.

Without objection, so ordered.
In  addition,  I  would  also  like  to  include  a  statement  for  the
record that the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biol-
ogy is submitting for today’s hearing. Without objection, so ordered.

This hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Edward  B.  Knipling,  Administrator,  Agricultural  Research  Service,

U.S. Department of Agriculture

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. What  do  you  see  as  the  most  significant  challenges  with  respect  to  the  Depart-
ment  of  Agriculture’s  involvement  in  the  ISS  National  Laboratory  and  how
should those challenges be addressed?

A1. The  two  major  challenges  to  USDA’s  participation  in  research  on  the  ISS  are
funding  and  relevancy.  Although  the  program  is  designed  to  provide  free  access  to
the  ISS,  considerable  funds  must  be  expended  by  the  USDA  to  develop  the  experi-
ment  intellectually  and  physically.  Technical  expertise  for  working  in  microgravity
would  have  to  be  developed  by  USDA  scientists.  This  work  is  not  currently  pro-
grammed; therefore, any additional funds would have to be obtained from other pro-
grams or industrial partners. Relevancy of many possible experiments is difficult to
assess because of the unfamiliar potential of work in microgravity.
Q2. How  can  the  use  of  the  ISS  National  Laboratory  help  improve  American  agri-

culture?
• Is  the  research  that  USDA  intends  to  conduct  on  the  ISS  at  the  level  of  basic

research, applied research or both?

• What type of outcome would the USDA require in order to characterize its ISS

utilization as successful?

A2. The  level  of  work  discussed  by  USDA  is  at  both  basic  and  applied  levels.  Suc-
cessful ISS utilization would ultimately be characterized by USDA as having solved
a  problem  for  American  agriculture.  Interim  success  would  be  characterized  by
USDA  as  having  developed  new  scientific  knowledge  that  demonstrates  significant
promise for solving a problem of American agriculture.
Q3. How  significant  is  the  need  to  be  able  to  return  cargo  from  the  Space  Station—
for  example,  research  samples  or  lab  equipment—for  the  type  of  research  initia-
tives  you  expect  to  pursue  on  the  ISS?  What  are  the  implications  if  this  return
cargo capability is not available?

A3. Some experiments would benefit from the return of cargo to the Earth. For ex-
ample,  one  hypothesis  proposes  that  cells  induced  to  grow  into  a  functioning  organ
in microgravity would transform to cells capable of doing the same at Earth gravity.
Returning  the  cells  to  Earth  would  be  the  only  way  of  evaluation.  On  the  other
hand, behavioral tests of insects or documentation of plant growth would not require
the return of any material to Earth.
Q4. There  has  been  no  commitment  by  the  current  Administration  as  to  how  long
the  U.S.  will  participate  in  the  International  Space  Station  program,  although
the Administration’s budget plan for NASA would end funding for the program
after  2016.  On  the  other  hand,  NASA  has  indicated  in  previous  testimony  that
it  sees  no  technical  or  operational  barriers  to  continuing  ISS  operations  until
2020.  What  service  life  do  you  think  would  be  optimal  or  required  for  the  types
of research activities that you envision the Station being utilized for?

A4. The  longer  service  life  of  the  ISS  (until  2020)  would  be  better  for  agricultural
research.  Very  little  agricultural  research  has  been  done  in  microgravity,  therefore
more study will be required to move from elementary to advanced studies.
Q5. Dr. Stodieck indicated in his prepared statement that three actions are required

for the ISS National Laboratory to be successful:
1) creation of an independent management organization;
2) provision of modest funding to support utilization; and
3) assurance of reliable and frequent transportation to and from the ISS.
• Do  you  agree  that  these  are  required  actions  necessary  to  ensure  the  Labora-

tory’s success?

taken?

• If  not,  could  you  please  discuss  the  priority  steps  that  you  believe  need  to  be

• What,  in  your  view,  would  be  an  effective  mechanism  for  coordinating  and

managing the use of the ISS National Laboratory?

A5. The  creation  of  an  independent  management  organization  might  be  useful  to
promote  the  best  research  on  the  ISS;  however,  other  organizational  models  (e.g.,
a  department  within  NASA)  would  probably  also  function  well.  ARS  generally  does
not  have  sufficient  unobligated  funding  to  pay  for  the  development  of  experiments
for the ISS, and thus provisions for funding augmentation to support ISS utilization
would be helpful. Those experiments will require payload costs ($20K per kilogram)
and  engineering  costs  to  develop  automated,  self-contained  experimental  systems
(likely  at  least  $200K  per  experiment).  Regular  and  frequent  transportation  to  the
ISS  would  be  necessary  for  continuous  experiments,  but  not  for  the  single-use  ex-
periments discussed so far.

The priority steps for developing agricultural experiments on the ISS are:

1) Define  the  technical  parameters  of  work  on  the  ISS;  specifically,  the  space
available,  the  potential  time  frames  of  experiments,  and  the  possibility  of
manual participation by astronauts.

2) Identify  experiments  and  strategic  research  directions  that  are  considered

mutually valuable.

3) Find funding for priority experiments.
4) Integrate the experiments into the program requirements of ARS.

The  ARS  portion  of  research  on  the  ISS  could  be  effectively  managed  by  a  com-
mittee  formed  from  ARS  National  Program  Staff  with  representatives  from  NASA.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. During  the  upcoming  five-year  gap,  it  appears  there  will  be  no—or  very  lim-
ited—ability  to  bring  back  research  samples,  experiments,  and  other  materials
from station. What are your thoughts about the usefulness of ISS as a laboratory
if there is no down-mass capability? Will the inability to return research samples
to  Earth  seriously  jeopardize  the  attractiveness  of  using  ISS  to  carry  out  re-
search? What steps can research take to compensate?

A1. The  lack  of  a  down-mass  capability  will  not  inhibit  many  kinds  of  experiments
that  are  more  oriented  toward  basic  science  rather  than  product  development.  Ex-
periments  that  gather  data  in  place  and  that  do  not  involve  returning  samples  to
Earth could have good relevance.
Q2. Several witnesses recommended. that NASA identify an organization to manage
research  conducted  on  ISS.  How  does  NASA  manage  ISS  research  today,  and
how  would  a  newly  established  research  management  organization  differ  from
the current model?

A2. ARS  is  unable  to  answer  this  question,  since  it  concerns  NASA  management.
From  an  ARS  perspective,  the  current  National  Program  Staff  would  be  the  logical
administrative mechanism for coordinating research.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Louis S. Stodieck, Director, BioServe Space Technologies; Associate Re-
search  Professor,  Aerospace  Engineering  Sciences,  University  of  Colorado  at
Boulder

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Your  prepared  statement  notes  that  the  success  of  the  ISS  National  Laboratory
will require ‘‘regular, reliable and frequent transportation access to and from the
ISS.’’

Q1a. What  level  of  frequency  and  reliability  in  access  to  the  ISS  do  you  anticipate

will be needed and why?

A1a. As the ISS is nearing completion, it is important to consider how to utilize this
world-class  facility  in  ways  analogous  to  that  of  ground-based  facilities.  On  the
ground, research investigations can be designed, carried out and data analyses com-
pleted  with  a  comparatively  short  turnaround.  This  allows  results  from  each  inves-
tigation  to  be  fully  incorporated  into  the  next  so  that  progress  to  a  final  result  or
product  can  occur  within  a  reasonable  timeframe.  It  also  allows  for  investigation
failures  to  occur,  whether  due  to  human  error,  flawed  experiment  designs,  equip-
ment  problems  and  so  forth,  such  that  an  investigation  can  be  promptly  repeated.
To be most productive, transport of research equipment, supplies and samples to the
ISS  should  occur  at  a  minimum  frequency  of  four  times  per  year.  A  greater  fre-
quency would be even better.

In  the  biotechnology,  pharmaceutical  and  biomedical  fields,  the  ability  to  analyze
samples  on  board  the  ISS  remains  very  limited.  As  such,  return  of  materials  proc-
essed on orbit will be essential for the foreseeable future. Ideally, the frequency and
quantity of transportation return from the ISS (down-mass) should be 75–90 percent
of the transportation to the ISS (up-mass).

It  is  also  important  to  try  and  provide  a  certain  degree  of  reliability  in  transpor-
tation  access  capabilities.  Reliable  transportation  refers  to  a  number  of  important
aspects  including  reliably  meeting  a  launch  schedule  (launching  on  time),  reliably
delivering utilization cargo to the ISS (successful rendezvous and docking) and reli-
ably  returning  materials  to  Earth.  Ideally,  reliable  transportation  should  include
late  stowage  and  early  retrieval  access  for  time  sensitive  biological  materials.  Fi-
nally,  the  process  for  approving  samples  and  equipment  for  transport  to  the  ISS
should  be  streamlined  so  that  the  transportation  manifest  can  be  kept  flexible  as
late  in  the  timeline  as  possible.  This  will  accommodate  late-breaking  research  re-
sults  and  optimized  equipment  and  samples.  In  essence,  the  reliability  goals  and
services for transportation access to and from the ISS should be viewed in a similar
manner to commercial carriers such as Federal Express and the UPS.
Q1b. What are the implications if this return cargo capability is not available?
A1b. Productivity  on  the  ISS  will  be  highly  dependent  on  the  frequency,  range  of
services and reliability of available space transportation carriers. Without return ca-
pability, research studies will be limited to those that produce electronic data on the
ISS that can be down-linked to investigators on the ground.

To give an example in the life sciences, modern sample analysis methods have be-
come  substantially  based  upon  molecular  analyses  of  messenger  ribonucleic  acid  or
mRNA expression. So called gene expression data or closely aligned protein analysis
data have become a mainstay of modern biology. In theory, these data could be gen-
erated  on  board  the  ISS.  However,  to  do  so,  samples  must  be  processed  using  haz-
ardous  chemicals,  multiple  fluid  addition  and  removal  steps,  centrifugation  and
heating  and  cooling  steps  to  produce  the  final  preparation  that  can  then  be  ana-
lyzed.  The  analysis  might  be  done  using  a  spectrophotometer,  plate  reader,  gene
chip  reader  or  another  piece  of  similar  equipment.  Because  of  the  use  of  hazardous
chemicals,  all  steps  must  be  done  with  redundant  levels  of  containment  in  place  to
protect  the  crew  member  carrying  out  the  process.  Crew  members  will  require  ex-
tensive  training  on  the  sample  processing  and  analysis  protocols  or  will  need  to  be
trained  life  scientists.  Some  work  has  been  done  by  NASA  to  develop  automated
methods for relatively simple molecular analyses in space but these technologies are
still too limited to be of much value for a productive ISS laboratory. Without a sig-
nificant  investment  in  new  sample  processing  hardware,  the  complexity  of  these
analyses will dictate that the samples are processed on the ground by highly trained
personnel.

Conducting  modern  biotechnology  and  biomedical  research  and  development  on
the ISS will be severely hampered without a sample return capability. If sample re-

turn after the retirement of the Shuttle is limited to the small down-mass capability
of  the  Russian  Soyuz  vehicles,  then  the  ISS  will  be  unable  to  meet  any  significant
commercial  or  academic  R&D  demand.  The  return  sample  requirements  of  NASA’s
exploration program alone will almost certainly exceed the Soyuz transportation ca-
pability.  This  will  create  a  severe  bottleneck  for  research  and  discourage  potential
users whether they are researchers from industry, universities, the NIH, the USDA
or  any  other  government  agency.  Effectively,  the  productivity  of  the  ISS  National
Laboratory will be reduced to a fraction of what otherwise would be possible.

In  addition  to  trying  to  minimize  this  risk  by  fostering  the  development  of  com-
mercial transportation capabilities, NASA could do more to support the development
of  flight  certified  equipment  that  could  enable  on  orbit  modern  analytical  methods.
Q1c. Could you please elaborate on how you arrived at 20–25 percent as a potential
figure  for  volume  on  ISS  supply  missions  that  is  devoted  to  National  Labora-
tory work?

A1c. Research investigations, samples and equipment are currently typically housed
within mid-deck lockers on the Space Shuttle. Experiments are either stowed within
a  NASA—provided  locker  or  the  locker  can  be  removed  and  replaced  with  a  cus-
tomer—provide  payload.  A  mid-deck  locker  ‘‘package’’  is  often  referred  to  as  a  mid-
deck  locker  equivalent  or  MLE.  Each  MLE  can  weigh  or  carry  up  to  32  kg  in  total
mass.  Based  on  the  history  of  the  Space  Shuttle  program  during  the  1990’s  when
it  was  used  extensively  for  research  and  not  being  used  to  assemble  the  ISS,  flight
of  research  equipment  and  materials  exceeded  50  to  75  MLEs  per  year.  This  range
of  transportation  need  would  enable  productive  use  of  the  ISS  National  Lab  and
would equate to 1.6–2.4 metric tons (MT) of research utilization supplies and equip-
ment per year.

NASA  recently  released  a  Request  for  Proposals  for  ISS  Commercial  Resupply
Services (CRS). Within this solicitation, NASA included a model task order that es-
timated  the  requirement  for  pressurized  cargo  delivery  to  the  ISS  of  7.4  MT  per
year. Assuming that this figure does not include ISS National Lab requirements, the
estimate for ISS National Lab users would need to be added to NASA’s logistics and
exploration  research  requirements.  This  equates  to  a  range  of  18–25  percent  of  the
total ISS transportation requirements. Again, to be most effective as a National Lab,
delivery should be distributed across a minimum of four to five flights per year.
Q2. There  has  been  no  commitment  by  the  current  Administration  as  to  how  long
the  U.S.  will  participate  in  the  International  Space  Station  program,  although
the Administration’s budget plan for NASA would end funding for the program
after  2016.  On  the  other  hand,  NASA  has  indicated  in  previous  testimony  that
it  sees  no  technical  or  operation  barriers  to  continuing  ISS  operation  to  2020.
• What  service  life  do  you  think  would  be  optimal  or  required  for  the  types  of

research activities that you envision the Station being utilized for?

A2. The answer to this question depends on a number of key assumptions:

• Transportation of research to and from the ISS will not be overly constrained

after the Space Shuttle is retired.

• Demand from multiple end users (commercial, government and academic) will
grow  as  the  ISS  assembly  is  completed  and  the  benefits  of  conducting  re-
search in space are clearly recognized.

• Resources,  including  funding,  to  support  productive  use  of  the  ISS  will  be

available.

use of the ISS.

• No  major  technical  or  operational  problems  will  occur  to  prevent  continued

• A  six-member  crew  will  be  available  to  support  a  robust  research  and  devel-

opment utilization program on the ISS.

Based  on  these  assumptions,  then  a  10-year  operational  life  for  the  ISS  after  the
assembly  is  complete  should  produce  a  high  yield  of  products,  technologies  and  sci-
entific data. This would suggest that utilizing the ISS through 2020 would be appro-
priate.  By  2020,  the  development  of  commercially  viable  alternatives  to  the  ISS  for
space-based R&D could reasonably be expected to be available. If so, and if the con-
tinued cost of maintaining and operating the ISS are high, then ending the ISS Pro-
gram  would  seem  appropriate.  Of  course,  the  ISS  lifetime  can  be  evaluated  on  an
ongoing basis and adjusted as necessary.

If  one  or  more  of  the  assumptions  listed  above  do  not  come  to  fruition,  then  pro-
ductivity of the ISS will be limited and the return on investment to the Nation will

be reduced. In this case, consideration should be given to an operational lifetime be-
yond the 2020 timeframe.
Q3. Given  your  experience  as  director  of  a  research  center  that  deals  with  univer-
sities,  federal  agencies,  and  industry  in  conducting  space  life  sciences  research,
what  factors  do  you  believe  are  essential  for  the  management  of  the  ISS  Na-
tional  Laboratory?  What  should  NASA  consider  as  it  explores  options  for  man-
aging the ISS National Lab?

A3. A  key  responsibility  for  the  management  organization  will  be  to  form  partner-
ships and agreements with commercial, academic and government agency organiza-
tions that wish to access the ISS National Lab. A number of additional key respon-
sibilities  for  the  ISS  National  Lab  management  organization  were  outlined  in  writ-
ten testimony. In brief, these additional responsibilities include:

• Performing outreach across multiple disciplines and multiple organizations to
educate  scientists  and  managers  on  the  benefits  of  conducting  research  and
development in space.
• Working to seamlessly integrate and fly research as a turn-key process so the
researchers  can  focus  on  the  research  and  not  on  the  processes  to  get  their
research flown on board the ISS.
• Working closely with the ISS Payloads Office to streamline the process of in-
• Maintaining  a  database  with  key  specifications  for  all  available  space  flight
• Assisting NASA to archive results from work performed on the ISS and effec-

research hardware that might be used on the ISS.

tegrating and certifying research for flight.

tively communicating these results to the public.

To  carry  out  these  responsibilities,  the  ISS  National  Lab  management  organiza-
tion  would  need  to  have  a  number  of  technical  discipline  experts  who  understand
the  type  of  research  that  can  be  done  on  the  ISS,  the  processes  that  must  be  fol-
lowed for the research to be successfully executed on orbit and the capabilities (and
limitations) that exist in available flight hardware. In other words, this organization
will  need  to  consist  of  scientists  and  engineers  working  side  by  side  to  support  the
many university, government and commercial end users of the ISS. Thus, the most
critical  factor  for  success  of  an  effective  management  organization  will  be  in  devel-
oping  an  organization  consisting  of  scientists,  engineers  and  managers  with  space
flight research expertise.

Currently,  NASA  has  formed  an  ISS  National  Lab  management  office  within  the
Space  Operations  Mission  Directorate.  This  organization  is  effectively  developing
partnerships  across  the  various  academic,  government  and  industry  sectors.  How-
ever,  more  could  be  done  to  grow  the  demand  for  ISS  utilization  and  to  support
those organizations that are interested but do not know how to conduct research on
the ISS. NASA should consider growing this organization within the agency or part-
ner  with  outside  organizations  to  assume  more  of  the  responsibilities  and  expertise
described above.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. During  the  upcoming  five-year  gap,  it  appears  there  will  be  no—or  very  lim-
ited—ability  to  bring  back  research  samples,  experiments,  and  other  materials
from station. What are your thoughts about the usefulness of ISS as a laboratory
if there is no down-mass capability? Will the inability to return research samples
to  Earth  seriously  jeopardize  the  attractiveness  of  using  ISS  to  carry  out  re-
search? What steps can researchers take to compensate?

A1. These questions have largely been addressed above. Indeed, having limited abil-
ity  to  return  samples  to  Earth  during  the  gap  period  will  seriously  jeopardize  the
ISS  National  Lab  concept.  Commercial  users  will  be  unable  to  pursue  any  reason-
able  business  development  activities.  Non-NASA  academic  or  government  scientists
will be unable to have any reasonable level of scientific productivity and will be dis-
couraged from even trying to use this national asset.

As  mentioned  above,  if  modern  analytical  techniques  could  be  employed  on  the
ISS, then data could be produced and down-linked to researchers on the ground. For
this  to  work,  investment  by  NASA  and/or  other  agencies  would  be  needed  now  so
the  required  equipment  could  be  developed  and  pressed  into  operation  on  the  ISS.
The  protocols  and  equipment  required  to  prepare  and  analyze  samples  on  orbit
would  not  be  easily  obtained  but  could  be  an  effective  alternative  to  inadequate
sample return capacity.

Q2. Several  witnesses  recommended  that  NASA  identify  an  organization  to  manage
research  conducted  on  ISS.  How  does  NASA  manage  ISS  research  today,  and
how  would  a  newly  established  research  management  organization  differ  from
the current model?

A2. As  indicated  above,  NASA  has  formed  an  office  within  the  Space  Operations
Mission Directorate that is focused on developing the ISS National Lab. This NASA
office  currently  is  working  on  identifying  and  forming  agreements  with  prospective
ISS  National  Lab  end-users  including  those  from  industry,  non-NASA  government
agencies and academic institutions. The goal of this office is to provide access to the
ISS  for  research  and  development  once  the  assembly  of  the  station  is  complete.  To
date,  NASA  has  Memoranda  of  Understanding  and  Space  Act  Agreements  with  a
number of government agencies and companies and with our university.

The  ISS  National  Lab  Management  office  at  NASA  Headquarters  works  closely
with  the  ISS  Payloads  Office  at  NASA–Johnson  Space  Center.  The  JSC  Payloads
Office  supports  all  NASA  and  non-NASA  users  of  the  ISS  by  prioritizing  payloads,
manifesting  Shuttle  transportation  and  integrating  payload  hardware  and  oper-
ations  requirements  across  all  NASA  and  non-NASA  payloads.  The  Chief  Scientist
of the Payloads Office also supports scientific and public outreach.

These  NASA  offices  work  well  together  and  do  an  excellent  job  of  supporting  the
full range of science being conducted on the ISS. However, these offices are limited
in  their  ability  to  market  the  unique  and  outstanding  R&D  potential  that  the  ISS
represents.  With  the  completion  of  the  ISS  only  two  years  away,  NASA  must  con-
tinue  to  develop  a  broad  ISS  user  community  that  can  take  advantage  of  what  the
ISS has to offer.

It  is  important  to  remember  that  a  large  research  user  community  had  been  de-
veloped  by  NASA  through  the  former  Office  of  Biological  and  Physical  Research.
This office and the community that it supported was vastly reduced and reorganized
under  the  current  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate.  As  a  result,  the  non-
exploration  user  community  of  the  ISS  National  Lab  now  has  to  be  effectively  re-
formed  from  sponsors  outside  of  NASA.  The  potential  certainly  exists  for  the  NIH,
USDA,  DOD,  DOE,  ED,  NSF,  universities,  colleges,  foundations  and  various  indus-
try  sectors  to  benefit  through  R&D  conducted  on  the  ISS.  Many  of  these  organiza-
tions  have  already  recognized  this  potential  and  have  formed  or  are  in  the  process
of  forming  agreements  with  NASA  to  utilize  the  ISS.  The  ISS  National  Lab  user
community  should  be  re-established  through  the  sponsorship  of  these  many  organi-
zations.

As  the  demand  for  the  ISS  grows,  one  of  the  most  critical  issues  in  supporting
a robust and productive set of R&D activities on the ISS will be funding. The orga-
nizations that are interested in benefiting from the ISS should not have to redirect
funds from other high-priority, ground-based research programs. Rather, new funds
should  be  made  available  to  support  the  translation  of  high-potential  R&D  to  the
ISS  National  Laboratory  operating  in  orbit.  This  point  cannot  be  overly  stressed.
The  demand  is  now  growing  and  should  be  grown  even  further.  Congress  should
make  strategic  investments  through  NASA  and  the  non-NASA  agency  sponsors  of
the envisioned ISS R&D.

By  expanding  the  ISS  National  Lab  office  at  NASA  and/or  through  the  develop-
ment  of  appropriate  partnerships,  an  ISS  National  Lab  management  organization
could  assume  some  of  the  additional  responsibilities  described  above  that  are  not
currently being supported by any NASA office. As an example, our center continues
to  provide  support  for  scientists  who  are  conducting  space-based  research  so  that
they  can  focus  on  their  research  and  not  on  learning  how  to  develop,  flight  qualify,
integrate  and  operate  a  payload  or  experiment  on  the  ISS.  While  our  center  is
happy  to  provide  this  level  of  service  to  enable  flight  research,  this  set  of  services
will need to be expanded if the ISS is to become even more productive after the as-
sembly  is  complete.  It  will  probably  be  inefficient  for  the  NIH  or  the  USDA  or  a
commercial  user  to  develop  such  in-house  expertise.  Establishing  an  organization
that can support both science and engineering aspects of a broad space research pro-
gram would help assure ultimate success of the ISS National Lab.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Cheryl A. Nickerson, Associate Professor of Life Sciences, School of Life
Sciences,  Center  for  Infectious  Diseases  and  Vaccinology,  The  Biodesign  Insti-
tute, Arizona State University

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Up until now, your experiment return needs have been met by the Shuttle. With
the  retirement  of  the  Shuttle  in  2010,  this  will  no  longer  be  available  to  you.
How  significant  is  the  need  to  be  able  to  return  cargo  from  the  International
Space  Station—for  example,  research  samples  of  lab  equipment—for  the  type  of
research  initiative  you  expect  to  pursue  on  the  ISS?  What  are  the  implications
if this return cargo capability is not available?

A1. The  loss  of  down-mass  resulting  from  the  retirement  of  the  Shuttle  will  have
a dramatic impact on the types of analyses performed and the information gathered
from  ISS  scientific  research.  Ground  based  analysis  of  samples  has  historically  al-
lowed  more  thorough  analyses  and  ‘‘real  time’’  changes  in  procedures  to  optimize
and  maximize  research  findings.  Loss  of  down-mass  will  especially  affect  research
that  requires  equipment  which  cannot  be  easily  miniaturized  or  multiple  pieces  of
equipment to fully evaluate the sample. While not preventable, scientific losses can
be  mitigated,  in  part,  by  the  provision  of  flight  hardware  that  can  be  utilized  by
multiple  investigators.  Examples  include  laboratory  basics,  such  as  centrifuges  and
specialized microscopes that would prevent the need for repetitive up-mass for indi-
vidual experiments. In addition, the development of specialized hardware for flight,
such as miniaturized molecular genetic analysis equipment, will allow experimental
samples to be analyzed during flight by the crew.
Q2. There  has  been  no  commitment  by  the  current  Administration  as  to  how  long
the  U.S.  will  participate  in  the  International  Space  Station  program,  although
the Administration’s budget plan for NASA would end funding for the program
after  2016.  On  the  other  hand,  NASA  has  indicated  in  previous  testimony  that
it  sees  no  technical  or  operational  barriers  to  continuing  ISS  operations  until
2020.  What  service  life  do  you  think  would  be  optimal  or  required  for  the  types
of research activities that you envision the Station being utilized for?

A2. The  International  Space  Station  is  a  unique  facility  that  will  likely  not  be  re-
produced  in  our  lifetimes.  Accordingly,  every  effort  should  be  made  to  extend  the
life  and  scientific  use  of  this  one-of-a-kind  laboratory  as  long  as  possible.  The  field
of  microgravity  research  has  only  begun  to  be  investigated  and  holds  enormous  po-
tential  for  ground-breaking  biotechnology  and  biomedical  innovations  and  discov-
eries  to  globally  advance  human  health.  ISS  will  be  a  critical  platform  for  research
(exploration and non-exploration) as long as it remains operational.
Q3. Dr. Stodieck indicated in his prepared statement that three actions are required

for the ISS National Laboratory to be successful:
1) creation of an independent management organization
2) provision of modest funding to support utilization
3) assurance of reliable and frequent transportation to and from the ISS

Q3a. Do  you  agree  that  these  are  required  actions  necessary  to  ensure  the  Labora-

tory’s success?

A3a. I  believe  that  key  modifications  are  needed  to  the  actions  proposed  by  Dr.
Stodieck.
Q3b. If  not,  could  you  please  discuss  the  priority  steps  that  you  believe  need  to  be

taken?

A3b. Dr. Stodieck’s proposal for the creation of an independent management organi-
zation for the ISS National Laboratory would appear at first glance to be beneficial;
however,  the  development  and  operation  of  such  a  board  is  not  a  trivial  matter.
Many complex issues would have to be addressed by such an organization in a clear,
concise and non-biased manner for such an approach to be even marginally effective.
For  example,  how  would  they  ‘‘integrate’’  with  NASA,  the  European  Space  Agency,
etc.?  How  would  this  board  interact  with  and  coordinate  interdisciplinary  research
between  multiple  scientists—or  between  commercial  investors/investigators?  How
would  intellectual  property  and  conflict  of  interest  issues  be  handled?  Who  deter-
mines the merit of the research to fly and when it will be manifested on ISS? What
are the research priorities? Both Exploration (mission applied) and non-Exploration

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00122 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

119

(non-mission/terrestrial-driven)  research  goals  should  be  funded—how  does  the
board  make  these  decisions?  What  is  the  composition  of  the  proposed  management
organization—NASA,  other  Federal  Government  agencies,  academic,  commercial?
Regardless,  this  board  would  still  have  to  interact  closely  with  NASA  flight  oper-
ations,  so  the  establishment  of  another  level  of  complexity  in  the  scientific  process
is  not  inherently  an  improvement  over  the  current  paradigm.  Alternatively,  could
the  current  NASA  management  paradigm  be  modified  to  be  more  effective  in  oper-
ation—thus  precluding  the  need  for  another  complicated  and  perhaps  detrimental
level of management.

Dr. Stodieck’s second recommendation was for modest funding to support ISS uti-
lization.  This  language  is  of  serious  concern  to  me,  as  ‘‘modest’’  funding  levels  do
not  work  well  for  robust  life  sciences  research  programs  on  Earth,  much  less  for
flight experiments. While this type of language may appear more palatable, the cor-
rect  phrase  is  ‘‘appropriate  funding.’’  You  get  what  you  pay  for—and  hypothesis-
driven, innovative, cutting edge research requires investment. The goal is not to fly
something simply to say that it has flown in space, but rather, to use the novel ena-
bling research platform of space flight to translationally advance our understanding
of  biological  and  physical  phenomenon  that  will  provide  long  lasting  return  to  the
protection  of  humans  as  they  explore  space  and  for  the  general  public  here  on
Earth.  Accordingly,  experimental  requirements  and  applications  for  space  research
should  be  clear  and  the  funding  adequate  for  successful  completion.  Running  a
space  research  program  on  a  ‘‘shoestring  budget’’  is  not  the  way  to  conduct  cutting
edge science that is critical for exploration, nor is it the way to maintain US leader-
ship  in  space  exploration.  Exploration  drives  science  and  science  drives  explo-
ration—the two cannot be separated. Unfortunately, the currently adopted paradigm
has negated the critical value of space research as an essential component of NASA.
This  has  led  to  slashing  the  already  minimal  life  support  funding  system  for  space
research—and in so doing, has both decimated and alienated a large segment of the
U.S. space life sciences research community and has seriously undermined the posi-
tion  of  the  U.S.  as  the  world’s  leader  in  space  exploration.  Our  nation’s  Vision  for
Space  Exploration  is  dependent  on  the  space  life  sciences  community  to  generate
knowledge leading to solutions to ensure safe passage for humans beyond Earth, to
train  the  future  workforce  to  maintain  U.S.  leadership  in  space  exploration,  and  to
translate findings from this work into human health benefits for the general public
on Earth.
Q3c. What,  in  your  view,  would  be  an  effective  mechanism  for  coordinating  and

managing the use of the ISS National Laboratory?

A3c. NASA’s current structure provides an acceptable mechanism for the operation
of  the  ISS  National  Laboratory;  however,  several  changes  at  NASA  would  benefit
the  science  that  can  be  performed.  First,  the  direction  of  the  fundamental  science
that  is  performed  should  be  guided  by  long-term,  well  coordinated  goals  to  benefit
general  science.  NASA  has  previously  assembled  ‘‘blue  ribbon’’  panels  that  have
made  recommendations  regarding  the  vision,  direction  and  priority  of  research
goals,  (including  commissioned  Decadal  Studies  by  the  National  Academy  of
Sciences). However, NASA’s commitment to these collective expert recommendations
over time has been inconsistent. Thus, in order to provide meaningful vision, direc-
tion  and  continuity  of  research  over  time,  a  standing  science  advisory  board  with
members  representing  NASA,  other  federal  agencies  (e.g.,  NIH,  USDA,  etc.),  and
academia should be established. This board would guide fundamental research (both
mission and non-mission-oriented) and should not be confused with NASA’s own re-
search  goals  to  benefit  the  exploration  of  space.  For  example,  the  development  of
countermeasures  to  protect  crew  health  during  flight  would  remain  under  the  pur-
view of NASA. Second, scientific collaboration and resource sharing should be facili-
tated  with  the  international  partners  of  the  station.  While  other  factors  do  govern
the  exchange  of  funding  and  intellectual  property,  NASA  should  be  provided  some
exception to these constraints to fully utilize this unique resource. Finally, it is crit-
ical  to  stress  that  consistency  in  both  access  to  the  ISS  and  funding  for  research
is key for any successful utilization of the ISS as a National Laboratory.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. During  the  upcoming  five-year  gap,  it  appears  there  will  be  no—or  very  limited
ability  to  bring  back  research  samples,  experiments,  and  other  materials  from
station.  What  are  your  thoughts  about  the  usefulness  of  ISS  as  a  laboratory  if
there  is  no  down-mass  capability?  Will  the  inability  to  return  research  samples
to  Earth  seriously  jeopardize  the  attractiveness  of  using  ISS  to  carry  out  re-
search? What steps can researchers take to compensate?

A1. Yes,  lack  of  down-mass  will  limit  use  and  jeopardize  the  usefulness  of  ISS  as
a laboratory. It will drive a need for improved and self sufficient analysis equipment
and other resources needed to complete the work on orbit in the future (i.e., without
the  need  to  return  payloads)—for  example,  microscope  with  greater  imaging  and
functional  capabilities,  easy  access  to  knowledge  of  available  and  functional  hard-
ware  for  research  use  (this  is  currently  difficult  information  for  researchers  to  ob-
tain), molecular genetic tools, and available space. These self-sustaining in-flight re-
search  technologies  will  be  critical  to  leave  low-Earth  orbit,  when  lack  of  resupply
is a critical issue!

*Also, please see response to Question #1 from Chairman Udall above.

Q2. Several  witnesses  recommended  that  NASA  identify  an  organization  to  manage
research  conducted  on  ISS.  How  does  NASA  manage  research  today,  and  how
would  a  news  established  research  management  organization  differ  from  the
current model?

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Thomas  Boone  Pickens,  III,  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,

SPACEHAB, Inc.

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. What do you see as the most significant challenges with respect to SPACEHAB’s
involvement  in  the  ISS  National  Laboratory  and  how  should  those  challenges
be addressed?

A1. SPACEHAB’s announcement of a Space Act Agreement with the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration (NASA) for use of the International Space Station
(ISS),  for  research,  development  and  industrial  processing  purposes  removed  one  of
our most significant challenges. This agreement will provide SPACEHAB with flight
opportunities on the Space Shuttle for the remaining assembly phase of the ISS, as
well  as  appropriate  on-orbit  ISS  resources  during  both  the  pre-  and  post-assembly
phases. The largest remaining challenge for SPACEHAB is the uncertainty of flight
opportunities  to  the  ISS  following  the  final  Shuttle  flight,  currently  scheduled  for
2010.
Q2. How  significant  is  the  need  to  be  able  to  return  cargo  from  the  Space  Station—
for example, research samples or lab equipment—for the type of commercial ini-
tiative you expect to pursue on the ISS? What are the implications if this return
cargo capability is not available?

A2. The commercial initiatives we are pursuing, including vaccine development and
protein  crystal  growth,  require  return  cargo  capability  from  the  ISS  National  Lab-
oratory. While research and development could occur on the ISS, the samples would
need  to  be  returned  to  Earth  in  order  for  this  research  to  be  commercially  viable.
If  the  return  cargo  capability  is  not  available,  it  would  change  the  direction  of
SPACEHAB’s  current  commercial  initiatives  in  space.  Our  research  has  indicated
that  most  identified  research  and  development  would  require  return  cargo  capa-
bility.
Q3. What types of results would SPACEHAB and the broader investment community
need  to  see  in  order  to  gain  confidence  in  the  use  of  ISS  for  commercial  drug
development or other initiatives? On what timescale would they need to see these
results?

A3. SPACEHAB  is  already  seeing  results  of  microgravity  research  with  our  recent
discovery of a salmonella vaccine target giving us a great deal of confidence for fur-
ther  research  and  development  through  the  use  of  the  ISS.  Our  successful  flights
prove  that  scientists  can  continue  to  rely  upon  the  development  of  microgravity
products on the ISS for years to come.
Q4. What are the implications for your business model if NASA decides not to oper-

ate the ISS past 2016?

A4. This would take away an incredibly valuable national resource that has already
proven  to  save  lives  on  earth  with  our  salmonella  vaccine  discovery  work  however
we have just begun and many more experiments need to be conducted. We reviewed
over  2,000  experiments  that  have  already  been  sent  to  microgravity  and  have  cho-
sen  those  that  have  showed  the  most  commercial  near-term  value.  We  saw  many
experiments that had great promise but needed more work on-orbit before we could
get  comfortable  with  an  acceptable  level  of  risk/reward.  Therefore,  the  longer  the
ISS  is  in  service  the  more  experiments  will  fly  and  the  more  commercially  viable
products  will  be  discovered.  It  is  simply  a  ratio  between  having  access  to  micro-
gravity  and  continuing  to  discover  products  that  will  enhance  and  save  lives  on
earth.  Having  spent  15  years  and  over  $100  billion  on  this  unique  environment,  it
seems a shame to have it fully operational for only five or six years when mankind
could benefit from its service for many decades.
Q5. You discussed SPACEHAB’s involvement in the Space Technology and Research
Students  (STARS)  program.  What  do  you  believe  has  been  the  impact  of  the
STARS program on STEM education?

A5. The STARS program gave students a heightened enthusiasm for STEM by giv-
ing  them  the  opportunity  for  hands  on  participation  in  microgravity  research.  By
utilizing the allure of space, STARS is able to attract students to STEM that might
otherwise not show an interest in these areas.

Q1. During  the  upcoming  five-year  gap,  it  appears  there  will  be  no—or  very  lim-
ited—ability  to  bring  back  research  samples,  experiments,  and  other  materials
from station. What are your thoughts about the usefulness of ISS as a laboratory
if there is no down-mass capability? Will the inability to return research samples
to  Earth  seriously  jeopardize  the  attractiveness  of  using  ISS  to  carry  out  re-
search? What steps can researchers take to compensate?

A1. See response to question two from Chairman Udall.
Q2. Several  witnesses  recommended  that  NASA  identify  an  organization  to  manage
research  conducted  on  ISS.  How  does  NASA  manage  ISS  research  today,  and
how  would  a  newly  established  research  management  organization  differ  from
the current model?

A2. Working  with  NASA  to  fly  samples  on  the  Shuttle  is  an  add  hock  process  that
offers  no  assurances  as  to  participating  organizations  and  making  it  nearly  impos-
sible  to  convince  the  investment  community  that  there  is  assured  access  to  micro-
gravity.  While  NASA  has  been  very  accommodating  to  date,  there  is  a  lack  of  con-
fidence  that  we  will  make  the  next  flight,  even  up  to  the  final  hours  prior  to  lift-
off. This makes it very difficult to attract and commit capital for the expensive pre-
flight processing when all would be lost if we were told we would not be on the next
flight due to cargo priorities.

It  would  therefore  be  very  helpful  if  there  was  a  policy  that  required  NASA  to
fly  both  pre-commercial  experiments  and  commercial  samples  to  microgravity.  Pre-
vious attempts to promote commercial uses of space by NASA have been largely un-
successful as we feel the more people that are involved slows down and complicates
a  process  that  is  already  very  understood  and  streamlined.  Therefore,  in  response
to the question, we would recommend only a change in the NASA policy to be man-
dated to send these payloads without exception but use the existing structure of se-
lection and flight safety review as this seems to be appropriate at this time.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  William  H.  Gerstenmaier,  Associate  Administrator  for  Space  Oper-

ations, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. How  much  will  NASA  have  spent  in  total  developing,  building,  and  operating
the International Space Station when it is completed in 2010? Please provide the
direct  costs  for  development,  operations  and  utilization,  cargo  and  crew  trans-
port, Shuttle transportation costs, and other costs to NASA.

A1. The  total  direct  cost  of  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  from  FY  1994
through  assembly  complete  in  FY  2010  is  estimated  to  be  $47.0B.  This  includes
$14.0B  for  development,  $16.0B  for  operations  and  utilization,  $1.0B  for  cargo  and
crew  transportation,  $13.0B  for  Space  Shuttle  transportation  costs,  and  $3.0B  in
other  costs  to  NASA.  These  figures  exclude  costs  for  phases  A,  B,  and  C  (i.e.,  the
Freedom Program) and International Partner costs.
Q2. What,  if  any,  mechanisms  exist  for  ISS  users  to  communicate  their  transpor-
tation  requirements  to  potential  and  future  ISS  commercial  cargo  providers,  or
do  you  expect  individual  researchers  to  be  working  directly  with  commercial
companies?

A2. International  Space  Station  (ISS)  user  transportation  requirements  for  both
NASA users and non-NASA, National Laboratory users must first be integrated into
a cohesive, time-phased delivery plan before being passed on to future ISS commer-
cial  cargo  providers.  This  ensures  that  user  payloads  are  scheduled  for  deployment
and  operation  on  the  ISS  during  a  period  when  payload  resources  and  accommoda-
tions are actually available. The ISS Payloads Division within NASA’s ISS Program
Office collects all U.S. domestic user transportation requirements in order to accom-
plish this function. This is done through the formal ISS Payload Integration Agree-
ment  process.  The  ISS  Program  Office  then  integrates  U.S.  user  payload  transpor-
tation requirements with requirements for payload and system operations and main-
tenance  from  Canada,  Europe,  Japan,  Russia  and  the  U.S.  The  result  is  a  time-
phased  cargo  transportation  plan  that  is  optimized  across  the  international  mixed
fleet  of  transportation  vehicles,  in  order  to  both  maintain  the  ISS  system  success-
fully  and  operate  payloads  productively  within  the  user  resource  allocations  speci-
fied in the international agreements. This function is accomplished through regular,
periodic Technical Interchange Meetings across the ISS partnership.

Individual  users  may  also  work  directly  with  commercial  companies  in  order  to
ascertain  possible  future  transportation  costs  and  available  physical  accommoda-
tions  during  the  transport  phase.  In  the  future,  some  portion  of  the  available  com-
mercial transportation capacity may be set aside on commercial flights for the serv-
ice  provider  to  market  directly  to  paying  customers;  however,  user  payloads  bound
for the ISS must first be assigned physical accommodations and operating resources
before being manifested for flight. As this scenario evolves, it will be important that
the  ISS  Program  Office  continues  to  work  closely  with  the  commercial  service  pro-
viders, so that all payloads arriving at the ISS can be physically integrated and pro-
ductively operated.
Q3. How  does  NASA  plan  to  validate  vendors’  claims  that  they  can  meet  the  Agen-

cy’s ISS cargo requirements in a credible and safe manner?

A3. NASA  released  an  ISS  Commercial  Resupply  Services  (CRS)  Request  for  Pro-
posals (RFP) on April 14, 2008, for resupply and return of ISS and utilization cargo.
Proposals were due back to NASA at the end of June 2008, with an award expected
at the end of calendar year 2008. The RFP identifies the specific criteria that NASA
will utilize in evaluating industry proposals. The criteria that NASA will utilize in-
cludes  evaluating  such  areas  as:  the  offeror’s  capability  to  meet  the  statement  of
work  based  on  the  level  of  development  maturity  of  those  capabilities;  the  produc-
tion  and  annual  delivery  capability,  and  processing  lead  times;  how  the  offeror’s
schedule and planning for ISS integration will impact the delivery of services under
this  contract;  the  offeror’s  understanding  of  the  risks  of  providing  the  ISS  resupply
services,  completeness  in  identifying  risks,  and  the  appropriateness  of  their  mitiga-
tion  plans;  and,  the  offeror’s  approach  for  safety  (range,  ground,  flight,  etc.),  reli-
ability,  maintainability,  supportability,  quality,  software  assurance,  and  risk  man-
agement  for  completeness  and  effectiveness  at  meeting  the  contract  requirements.

Q4. What  effect  will  the  increase  to  a  six-person  crew  on  ISS  have  on  crew  time  to
support  research  and  other  utilization  activities?  Will  the  time  available  for  re-
search double?

A4. In  the  early  2009  timeframe,  when  the  ISS  is  still  operating  with  three  crew,
there  will  be  approximately  40  crew-hours  per  week  available,  on  annual  average,
to operate, maintain and utilize the U.S. Operating Segment (USOS). This assumes
that  1.5  of  the  three  crew  members  is  working  on  the  USOS,  and  that  each  astro-
naut works approximately 32.5 hours per week. This is equivalent to approximately
48.75 crew hours per week, and is reduced to approximately 40 crew-hours per week
after  joint  Shuttle-Station  assembly  period  operations  are  subtracted  out.  Also  dur-
ing  this  timeframe,  37-40  crew  hours  per  week  will  be  needed  for  USOS  systems
operations and maintenance. Under these circumstances, up to three crew-hours per
week are estimated to be available for USOS utilization.

flected in hours per week.

By  late  2009,  ISS  crew  complement  will  increase  to  six  and,  assuming  three  of
the six astronauts are working on the USOS, will yield approximately 85 crew hours
per week to operate, maintain and utilize the USOS. By this timeframe, the remain-
ing  assembly  elements  will  have  been  integrated  and  it  will  then  require  approxi-
mately  65  crew-hours  per  week  to  operate  and  maintain  the  USOS,  and  there  will
be  approximately  20  crew-hours  per  week  available  to  utilize  the  USOS.  The  time
available for research in the USOS increases from up to three hours per week (three
crew) to 20 hours per week (six crew).

During  the  post-assembly  period,  the  crew  time  capability  for  the  USOS  is  esti-
mated to further increase to approximately 100 hours per week because there is no
longer the need for joint Shuttle-Station assembly operations, while the requirement
to operate and maintain the USOS remains constant at 65 hours per week. At this
stage, approximately 35 hours per week are projected to be available for USOS utili-
zation.

The  table  below  summarizes  this  evolution  in  USOS  crew  time  capability,  re-

Q4a. How will crew time be allocated for ISS utilization activities?
A4a. Crew time will be allocated according to payload operating priorities as deter-
mined  by  the  tactical  level,  multilateral  Research  Planning  Working  Group  in  ac-
cordance with strategic level NASA Headquarters policy direction and international
Memorandum of Understanding provisions.
Q4b. Do ISS crews need to be trained in advance to support research and other utili-
zation  activities  occurring  through  the  National  Laboratory?  If  so,  how  much
lead  time  is  required  for  this  crew  preparation  and  when  would  NASA  need
to know what research would be flown?

A4b. Yes,  virtually  all  utilization  activities  require  some  level  of  crew  familiariza-
tion  and  training.  These  requirements  vary  widely  depending  on  payload  com-
plexity. Nominally, a two-year planning horizon is desired so that specific utilization
activities can be identified in the Increment Definition and Requirements Document;
however,  the  Space  Station  Program  is  currently  integrating  relatively  small  (e.g.,
mid-deck  locker  scale)  experiments  within  six  months  of  launch,  particularly  when
re-flights  of  flight-certified  apparatus  are  involved.  Future  utilization  demand  ap-
pears  to  be  evolving  largely  in  the  direction  of  the  life  sciences  and  biotechnologies
where experiments are being planned at the cellular and molecular levels. In these
cases, locker-scales are common and integration is relatively straightforward.
Q5. Regarding  cargo  transport  to  the  ISS,  your  testimony  notes  that  ‘‘The  ISS  Pro-
gram continues to evaluate the up mass requirements and spares procurement
strategy to sustain nominal system and research operations.’’

Q5a. When  does  NASA  anticipate  being  able  to  provide  firm  up  mass  requirements

to potential commercial providers?

A5a. NASA  issued  a  Commercial  Resupply  Services  Request  for  Proposals  in  mid-
April  of  this  year,  and  proposals  were  due  by  the  end  of  June.  Following  proposal
evaluation,  NASA  plans  to  enter  into  firm  fixed-price  contracts  for  commercial
transportation services by the end of calendar year 2008. These contracts will speci-
fy up-mass requirements.
Q5b. Will those requirements include down-mass?
A5b. The contracts will also include down-mass requirements for those service pro-
viders that can deliver the capability.
Q5c. How  much  additional  up-mass  and  down-mass  would  be  included  in  NASA’s

requirements to support ISS National Lab users?

A5c. The  specific  transportation  requirements  for  National  Laboratory  users  have
not  yet  been  defined  in  detail  because  the  U.S.  Government  agencies  and  private
firms  that  have  entered  into  agreements  with  NASA  to  use  the  ISS  are  just  begin-
ning  to  plan  their  respective  research  programs.  NASA  has  estimated  that  a
throughput capacity of as much as three metric tons per year could be available on
the International Space Station to support National Laboratory users.
Q5d. When  do  potential  commercial  cargo  suppliers  need  to  know  the  full  breadth
of  cargo  requirements  in  order  to  assess  the  potential  market  and  respond  ac-
cordingly?

A5d. Commercial  cargo  suppliers  have  been  informed  of  the  full  breadth  of  cargo
requirements  throughout  the  Request  for  Information  and  Request  for  Proposals
processes over the last several years. The International Space Station cargo require-
ments  have  been  well-defined  and  stable,  and  are  highly  representative  of  future
needs.
Q6. What  is  NASA’s  timeline  for  determining  a  management  structure  for  the  ISS

National Lab?

A6. As outlined in the report NASA submitted to Congress in April 2007 regarding
International  Space  Station  (ISS)  National  Laboratory  Applications  Development,
the strategy to first identify credible and qualified end-users was emphasized. Since
that  report,  NASA  has  entered  into  separate  Memorandum  of  Understanding  with
the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricul-
tural Research Service. In addition, two Space Act Agreements (SAAs) with private
firms  and  one  with  a  state  university  have  been  signed,  while  additional  SAAs  re-
main  under  development.  Finally,  a  self-organizing  Biotechnology  Space  Research
Alliance has been formed in southern California that consists of university, industry
and  municipal  government  partners.  As  a  result  of  these  developments,  NASA  is
well along in the process of identifying credible and qualified end-users.

In FY 2010, efforts will turn to: (1) defining the respective research programs for
each of the new partners and translating their strategic research objectives into an
executable  portfolio  of  specific  payload  plans  with  detailed  specification  of  require-
ments  for  ISS  resources  and  accommodations;  and,  (2)  working  with  the  new  part-
ners  to  determine  the  most  effective  and  appropriate  management  structure(s)  for
the  post-2010  real-time  operations  timeframe.  In  this  latter  activity,  the  ISS  Pro-
gram’s  Payload  Office  will  perform  a  central  role  in  physical,  analytical  and  oper-
ations integration, while NASA’s Space Operations Mission Directorate continues to
manage  policy  aspects  of  ISS  National  Laboratory  operations  in  concert  with  direc-
tion  from  the  Executive  and  Legislative  branches.  Decisions  regarding  ISS  oper-
ations post 2016 will be made by future Administrations and Congresses.
Q7. Section  2006  of  the  America  COMPETES  Act  directs  NASA  to  ‘‘develop  a  de-
tailed  plan  for  implementation  of  I  or  more  education  projects  that  utilize  the
resources  offered  by  the  International  Space  Station.’’  What  is  the  status  of
NASA’s work on developing this plan?

A7. Working  with  the  established  interagency  ISS  National  Laboratory  Education
Concept  Development  Task  Force,  NASA  has  completed  a  plan  in  response  to  the
provisions of Section 2006 of the America COMPETES Act (P.L.110–69) and a report
outlining  the  plan  was  submitted  to  Congress  on  June  20,  2008.  The  report  identi-
fies a series of specific education projects conceived by the cooperating agencies that
could be conducted using the International Space Station.
Q8. The  America  COMPETES  Act  also  directs  NASA  to  develop  a  plan  for  ISS  re-
search that will serve to increase U.S. science, technology, and engineering com-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00129 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

petitiveness  and  to  consult  with  organizations  that  have  agreements  to  use  the
ISS  National  Lab  in  developing  the  plan.  What  is  the  status  of  this  planning
effort?

A8. NASA  has  brought  this  provision  of  the  America  COMPETES  Act  (P.L.  110–
69)  to  the  attention  of  each  of  the  new  ISS  National  Laboratory  partners.  In  each
case,  we  expect  these  partners  to  develop  specific  research  and  development  (R&D)
plans  in  the  coming  year  that  can  be  made  available  to  the  Congress  in  direct  re-
sponse  to  the  Act.  For  instance,  NASA  is  currently  cooperating  with  the  National
Institutes of Health (NIH) on development of a Funding Opportunity Announcement
to  be  issued  by  NIH  by  the  end  of  FY  2008.  The  response  to  this  announcement
and the proposals selected by NIH will represent their initial R&D plan for the ISS.
It  is  important  to  note  that  these  plans  may  be  constrained  by  the  availability  of
appropriated funds at each partner Agency.
Q9. I understand that you have recently met with the Russian company making the

Soyuz.

Q9a. Do you have any insight into their quality control processes?
A9a. The  Soyuz  has  long  track  record  of  success.  NASA’s  insight  into  their  quality
control  process  is  part  of  the  reporting  in  the  contract  and  is  handled  through  reg-
ular  contract  progress  reviews  and  anomaly  reporting.  Additionally,  the  Russians
have  been  responsive  to  specific  requests  for  information  concerning  the  April  2008
ballistic re-entry.
Q9b. Since NASA will be relying on Soyuz during the gap, are you taking any addi-
tional precautions following the last ballistic Soyuz re-entry to ensure the safety
of U.S. and partner astronauts using the Soyuz to return from the ISS?

A9b. The  International  Space  Station  is  an  interdependent  partnership.  NASA  and
the  Russian  Federal  Space  Agency  share  the  goal  of  fully  understanding  mission
anomalies to ensure the safety of all of crew members. NASA will continue to work
closely  with  Russia  on  our  respective  anomaly  reporting  and  correction  processes,
during both manufacturing and operations phases.

On  July  10,  2008,  Cosmonauts  Sergei  Volkov  and  Oleg  Kononenko  performed  RS
EVA  #20A.  The  primary  task  on  EVA  #20A  was  the  inspection  and  retrieval  of  a
pyrobolt  from  one  of  the  five  latches  on  the  Soyuz.  This  was  done  to  support  the
investigation  of  the  ballistic  descent  of  the  last  two  Soyuz  vehicles.  Kononenko’s
Orlan suit was outfitted with a U.S. Wireless Video System to allow ground special-
ists  to  monitor  real-time  views  from  his  helmet  camera  during  the  retrieval.  While
no anomalies were observed during the EVA, the pyrobolt will be returned for close
inspection  as  part  of  the  ongoing  investigation  process.  NASA  is  working  closely
with  Roscosmos  to  thoroughly  evaluate  all  aspects  of  Soyuz  design  and  operations,
and  assist  in  the  performance  thermal  and  structural  analyses  related  to  the  re-
entry conditions.
Q10. It has been reported that the Russians will need additional funding to complete

construction of its ISS research facilities.

Q10a. Have  the  Russians  informed  NASA  of  delays  to  its  planned  Multi-Purpose

Laboratory Module and Research Module?

A10a. In  the  most  recent  review  of  Russian  activities,  the  Russians  reported  that
all their modules are on schedule.
Q10b. How do these delays factor into the planning needed to complete ISS construc-

tion and begin full operations?

A10b. There  is  no  impact  to  the  U.S.  program  if  the  Russian  modules  are  delayed.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. At the hearing, concern was raised about the future cost of carrying research ex-
periments  and  samples  to  and  from  ISS  on  cargo  flights.  Specifically,  the  re-
search  community  fears  that  the  cost  of  integrating  the  experiment  for  launch
to  and  from  ISS,  plus  the  cost  of  the  operations  and  safety  certification,  and
transportation  on  cargo  flights,  could  prove  to  be  too  expensive  for  many  re-
searchers. What are NASA’s plans with respect to managing and pricing experi-
ments to be conducted on ISS?

A1. There are six categories of cost related to conducting research and development
(R&D)  projects  within  the  utilization  capacity  of  the  International  Space  Station

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00130 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

(ISS)  USOS  U.S.  Operating  Segment  (USOS)  in  its  role  as  a  National  Laboratory.
The ‘‘user community’’ consists of other U.S. Government agencies (e.g., National In-
stitutes  of  Health  and  Department  of  Agriculture),  private  firms  (e.g.,  SPACEHAB
and  Zero  Gravity,  Inc.)  and  universities  (e.g.,  Bioserve  Space  Technology  Center  at
the  University  of  Colorado)  that  have  entered  into  formal  Memoranda  of  Under-
standing  and/or  Space  Act  Agreements  for  use  of  the  ISS  for  R&D  purposes.  Each
of these categories is discussed below.
1. Cost  of  ISS  USOS  On-Orbit  Resources  and  Accommodations:  NASA  does
not  intend  to  charge  any  user  fees  for  U.S.  use  of  ISS  National  Laboratory  accom-
modations  and  resources.  These  costs  are  subsumed  under  the  annual  operations
and maintenance cost of the ISS USOS.
2. Cost  of  Participating  R&D  Personnel:  The  research  community  that  NASA
has entered into agreements with for use of the ISS as a national laboratory recog-
nizes  that  it  is  their  responsibility  to  cover  the  cost  of  their  own  R&D  personnel.
In  the  case  of  government  agencies,  this  includes  the  cost  of  external  grant  recipi-
ents and/or internal research staff. In the case of private firms and universities, this
includes  the  cost  of  company  personnel  and/or  university  employees  and  students.
3. Cost  of  Space  Certified  Equipment  and  Facilities:  In  most  cases,  R&D
plans  will  rely  on  the  use  of  existing  payload  equipment  and  facilities  that  have
been  developed  and  flight-qualified  previously  in  the  ISS  Program  (e.g.,  Express
racks  &  pallets,  rack-scale  special  purpose  research  facilities,  mid-deck  lockers  and
drawers, refrigerators and freezers, etc.). A complete listing of flight equipment can
be found at: http://www.nasa.gov/mission¥pages/station/science/experiments/Dis-
cipline.html
4. Cost  of  Payload  Analytical  and  Operations  Integration:  These  costs  in-
clude: definition of payload characteristics, properties and requirements in a formal
Payload  Integration  Agreement;  training  crew  for  on-orbit  payload  operations;  and,
final  integration  of  the  payload  into  the  on-orbit  operations  timeline.  The  ISS  Pro-
gram Office is currently budgeted to perform these functions for full use of the ISS
USOS utilization capacity.
5. Cost  of  Payload  Physical  Integration  and  Safety  Certification:  The  build-
up of specific payload configurations, document production, verification testing, and
safety  certification  is  a  responsibility  of  the  end-user.  NASA  has  worked  aggres-
sively to minimize these costs within the safety and mission assurance environment.
The key to cost containment is the re-flight of previously qualified flight equipment
that  can  maximize  the  use  of  existing  hardware/software  systems  and  documenta-
tion products. Experienced end-users have developed a close familiarity with the rig-
ors of NASA payload physical integration and safety certification practices, and are
knowledgeable in minimizing the associated costs.
6. Cost of Space Transportation: NASA is currently in the midst of acquiring do-
mestic,  commercial  space  transportation  services  (Request  for  Proposals  released  in
mid-April with plans for award of firm fixed-price contracts by the end of 2008). At
this time, the cost and availability of these services is not clear; however, these as-
pects  will  continue  to  mature  in  the  coming  years  as  U.S.  commercial  service  pro-
viders evolve and demonstrate their capabilities and pricing strategies. A transition
period  can  be  anticipated  during  which  end-user  payloads  are  initially  transported
in  the  marginal  capacity  of  ISS  re-supply  missions  purchased  by  NASA  and  later
manifested directly by the commercial service provider. The specific prices, practices
and procedures will become clearer as this capability emerges in the post-assembly,
post-Shuttle period.
Q2. The  Europeans,  Russians,  and  soon  the  Japanese,  have—or  will  have—their
own  research  facilities  on-board  ISS.  What  steps  are  taken  among  the  inter-
national partners to ensure there is no duplication of research activities on ISS,
and that the science return is maximized?

A2. Each ISS partner is free to pursue research at its own discretion in accordance
with  provisions  of  the  bilateral  agreements.  Some  degree  of  duplication  is  antici-
pated  and  indeed  encouraged,  in  order  to  foster  unique  approaches  to  solving  com-
mon scientific issues and advancing the state-of-the-art. Nonetheless, cooperation is
also encouraged where beneficial to both, or all, partners. For example, we establish
arrangements  for  research  from  one  partner  to  be  conducted  in  the  facilities  of  an-
other  partner  to  maximize  the  science  return  from  those  facilities  on  orbit.  This  is
fostered  through  scientific  working  groups  in  discipline-specific  areas,  such  as  life
sciences  and  microgravity  sciences.  For  example,  the  International  Life  and  Micro-
gravity  Science  Working  Group  (ISLSWG),  composed  of  the  Japanese,  Canadian,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:35 Sep 10, 2008 Jkt 041799 PO 00000 Frm 00131 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\042408\41799 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

128

and  several  European  space  agencies  (ESA,  DLR,  CNES,  ASI),  meets  twice  a  year
to  discuss  and  coordinate  research  activities,  many  of  which  will  be  conducted  on
the ISS.
Q3. What options does NASA have in place should COTS not prove viable? Will ATV
and  HTV  be  able  to  meet  station  needs  until  Orion/Ares  becomes  operational?
A3. Services  to  deliver  cargo  transportation  requirements  are  being  acquired
through the Commercial Resupply Services competitive procurement, which is open
to  all  bidders,  including  existing  COTS  partners  (holders  of  both  funded  and  un-
funded  COTS  Space  Act  Agreements).  In  the  event  domestic  commercial  cargo  re-
supply services are delayed, NASA will further optimize its usage of other cargo de-
livery capabilities, while aggressively managing the degradation in ISS systems and
adjusting U.S. utilization of the ISS until the services become available.

In addition to commercial services, NASA’s strategy is to pre-position ISS system
spares  on  the  flights  which  remain  before  Space  Shuttle  retirement  in  2010.  NASA
also  receives  a  share  of  the  cargo  capacity  on  all  ATV  and  HTV  flights  as  a  part
of  the  barter  agreement  for  launch  of  European  and  Japanese  elements  to  the  ISS
on the Space Shuttle. Finally, NASA has contracted with Russia to continue to pro-
vide cargo on Progress flights through the end of calendar year 2011.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Cristina T. Chaplain, Director, Acquisition and Sourcing Management,

U.S. Government Accountability Office

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Your  prepared  statement  concludes  that  any  delays  in  flying  the  Shuttle  could
‘‘require NASA to choose between completing the station as planned and pre-po-
sitioning of needed critical spares.’’ In your view, what would NASA need to con-
sider in making such a tradeoff?

A1. There would be little value in bringing up additional components to the station,
if  the  station  itself  could  not  operate  effectively  until  2016  or  beyond.  Therefore,
NASA  would  have  to  consider  what  spares  are  vital  to  sustaining  the  station  that
require  the  lift  capacity  of  the  Shuttle  and  give  them  high  priority.  This  is  a  fluid
situation as NASA is still learning about the lifespan of its spares and is continually
identifying parts that need special attention.
Q2. What does GAO think about NASA’s acquisition strategy for acquiring commer-
cial  cargo  transportation  services?  What  do  you  think  about  the  schedule  it  has
laid out in the ISS re-supply services request for proposal?

A2. On  the  surface,  it  would  seem  that  NASA  is  prematurely  awarding  a  launch
contract  given  that  COTS  capabilities  have  not  been  demonstrated.  However,  the
government’s  liability  for  costs  is  limited  by  the  fact  that  the  contract  is  an  Indefi-
nite  Delivery  Indefinite  Quantity  (IDIQ)  contract,  which  provides  for  an  indefinite
quantity  of  supplies  or  services  within  stated  limits  during  a  fixed  period  of  time.
More specifically, the government is only obligated to purchase a minimum amount
of  supplies  or  services.  Under  NASA’s  solicitation,  the  agency  may  select  multiple
vendors to participate in this contract; they all will be subject to NASA insight and
approval for notice to proceed and or approval of requirements, plans, tests, or suc-
cess  criteria;  there  are  stated  criteria  as  to  what  capabilities  need  to  be  dem-
onstrated;  and  NASA  will  determine  if  vendors  are  successful.  Therefore,  while
NASA has already awarded the contract to one vendor, it is our understanding that
the  vendor  still  needs  to  demonstrate  capability  before  more  than  the  minimum
amount  of  services  will  be  ordered.  Moreover,  other  vendors,  including  those  who
are  not  being  paid  under  Space  Act  agreements,  can  eventually  participate  in  the
IDIQ if they develop capability that would suit the station.
Q3. Your  prepared  statement  indicates  that  NASA  has  stated  it  will  use  inter-
national partners’ vehicles to conduct some supply activities. Since partners have
already  committed  these  significant  portions  of  these  vehicles’  capacity  to  carry
their  own  cargo,  how  much  additional  cargo  capacity  would  NASA  have  access
to?

A3. NASA  is  conducting  ongoing  assessments  on  how  ISS  re-supply  will  be  sup-
ported  by  international  partner  vehicles.  International  partner  vehicles  differ  in
what  cargo  they  can  carry  and  each  has  an  internal  capacity  of  roughly  2,000  kilo-
grams.  However,  even  with  the  use  of  these  vehicles  in  some  fashion,  NASA  still
faces a capacity shortfall of over 50 metric tons between 2010 and 2015.
Q4. In  your  prepared  statement  you  indicate  that  if  unanticipated  construction
delays  occur,  NASA  may  need  to  hold  back  two  components—Node  3  and  the
Cupola—which  could  constrain  the  ability  to  conduct  research  and  the  quality
of life on the station for the crew. What research would be impacted?

A4. It is difficult to identify what research would be impacted by not installing the
Cupola and Node 3. Both elements are not specific to the conduct of research. How-
ever, failure to install these elements would further limit the availability of storage
space  on  the  station.  A  shortfall  in  storage  capacity  could  impact  research  if  some
of  the  laboratory  modules  are  used  to  store  materials  and  supplies.  We  will  be  ex-
amining this question more specifically in a follow-on review for this subcommittee.
Q5. In  your  prepared  statement,  you  indicate  that  Johnson  Space  Center  officials
were skeptical that commercial transportation services would be available on the
projected  schedule.  How  do  you  reconcile  this  skepticism  with  the  accelerated
pace embodied in the schedule for the new Commercial Resupply RFP?

A5. The  schedule  goals  for  the  COTS  program  may  well  be  optimistic  as  our  testi-
mony  emphasized.  However,  the  launch  services  RFP  itself  only  obligates  the  gov-
ernment to purchase a minimum amount of services or supplies.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. What options does NASA have in place should COTS not prove viable? Will ATV

and HTV be able to meet station needs until Orion/Ares become operational?

A1. NASA’s  options  for  servicing  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  are  limited
if Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) do not prove viable. The Eu-
ropean  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  (ATV)  and  the  Japanese  H–II  Transfer  Vehicle
(HTV),  along  with  the  Russian  Progress  vehicle,  can  provide  limited  capabilities  to
deliver  cargo  and  supplies  to  ISS,  but  NASA  predicts  a  51.8  metric  ton  shortfall  to
ISS  re-supply  needs  relying  on  these  vehicles  alone  after  Shuttle  retirement.  The
ATV  has  a  cargo  capability  of  7,500  kg  (primarily  for  water  and  atmospheric  gas);
the  HTV  has  a  cargo  capability  of  6,000  kg  (primarily  for  water  and  atmospheric
gas, but also for limited unpressurized external cargo); and the Progress has a cargo
capability of 2,600 kg (including some pressurized cargo). None of these vehicles has
the  capability  to  carry  crew  members.  Additionally,  none  of  these  vehicles  has  a
cargo  return  capability  because  they  disintegrate  during  return  to  Earth.  Lastly,
only limited numbers of the ATV and HTV are being produced.

According to NASA officials, without COTS, only Russian Soyuz vehicles can pro-
vide for crew rotation and very small cargo return capabilities. Currently, NASA re-
liance  on  Russian  vehicles  for  ISS  support  is  permitted  under  an  exemption  to  the
Iran  Nonproliferation  Act  of  2000  (now  entitled  the  Iran,  North  Korea  and  Syria
Nonproliferation Act), which expires January 1, 2012.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Jeffrey  P.  Sutton,  Director,  National  Space  Biomedical  Research  Insti-

tute

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Your prepared statement refers to ‘‘strategic goals the ISS can fulfill in the area
of biomedical research to address exploration needs.’’ Could you please elaborate
on these goals, the progress being made to date, and what more needs to be done
to achieve these goals?

A1. Two broad strategic goals are outlined in my prepared statement regarding the
International  Space  Station  (ISS)  and  biomedical  research  to  address  exploration
needs.  The  first  goal  is  that  ISS  serves,  and  needs  to  be  utilized,  as  an  invaluable
platform  for  biomedical  science  and  technology  projects  that  are  currently  under
way.  These  projects  have  substantial  promise  for  yielding  results,  countermeasures
and  technologies  that  will  enable  safe  human  exploration  of  space.  Some  of  the
projects  are  ground-based  studies  that  are  working  their  way  through  a  product
pipeline toward ISS flight testing and evaluation over the next several years. Other
projects  are  presently  ready  for  flight  definition  and  study  aboard  the  ISS.  As  ISS
nears  completion  and  research  capabilities  grow,  it  is  strategically  prudent  to  cap-
italize  on  investments  made  in  the  current  portfolio  of  research  and  technology  de-
velopment.

A second goal is to take advantage of the efforts associated with the first goal and
foster  new  opportunities  in  biomedical  research  and  development  for  exploration.
One area to look at is emerging partnerships between academia and industry, where
there  has  been  positive  activity  to  share  costs  on  projects.  Another  area  of  oppor-
tunity lies in the integration and synergy among projects that make up an expand-
ing  portfolio  of  flight  studies.  Integration  among  projects  is  important  and  adds
value  to  the  scientific  enterprise.  It  is  also  timely  as  the  depth  and  breadth  of  ISS
capabilities  as  an  orbiting,  microgravity  laboratory  expand.  Moreover,  integration
fosters  international  cooperation,  international  crew  participation,  and  can  lead  to
new,  unanticipated  discoveries  to  advance  knowledge  and  countermeasures  to  com-
plex biomedical risks.

These  two  goals  were  presented  in  the  context  of  the  important  role  the  ISS  can
have  for  biomedical  research  and  exploration.  There  are  other  considerations  as
well.  For  example,  beneficial  information  for  exploration  is  gained  on  human  per-
formance, psychosocial adaptation and team cohesion while accruing operational ex-
perience  aboard  ISS.  Furthermore,  it  should  not  be  construed  that  the  goals  stated
in my testimony are inconsistent with the goals and sub-goals put forth in the ‘‘2006
NASA Strategic Plan.’’

With  this  clarification  in  mind,  it  is  laudable  that  progress  in  ISS  biomedical  re-
search has been achieved, given the (1) challenges of conducting biomedical research
in general, (2) constraints imposed by mass, power, volume, cost and crew time, (3)
impacts  from  the  Columbia  tragedy,  and  (4)  limitations  imposed  by  performing  re-
search within a facility simultaneously undergoing construction. Progress in specific
areas  is  summarized  in  my  prepared  statement,  which  provides  references  for  the
principal  U.S.-sponsored  biomedical  experiments  aboard  the  ISS.  Ground-based
projects  that  are  ready  for,  or  in  the  process  of  maturing  toward,  ISS  testing  and
evaluation, are also listed with references.

Regarding  matters  that  need  to  be  addressed  in  order  to  achieve  the  goals,  it  is
vital  to  have  adequate  and  consistent  funding  to  enable  continuity  in  science  and
technology efforts. At present, there is a small but critical mass of outstanding and
dedicated  investigators  from  acrossthe  Nation,  who  are  conducting  necessary  inves-
tigations  to  enable  safe  human  exploration  of  space.  These  investigators  are  sci-
entific, technical and educational leaders, who are at the forefront of their fields and
are at premier academic institutions, biotechnology companies and government lab-
oratories  (NASA  and  other  agencies).  They  have  the  unique,  collective  expertise  to
drive  U.S.  achievements  in  space  biomedical  research  forward,  while  at  the  same
time  inspiring  and  training  the  next  generation  of  scientists,  engineers  and  physi-
cians.  It  is  therefore  important  that  their  projects  and  teaming  with  each  other,
with  younger  investigators  entering  the  field,  and  with  the  operational  community
at NASA be sustained and appropriately augmented as ISS capabilities expand.

Along  similar  lines,  as  NASA  looks  to  implement  memoranda  of  understanding
with  other  federal  agencies,  such  as  the  National  Institutes  of  Health,  new  appro-
priations for collaborative ISS research should be considered. These new appropria-
tions  are  also  relevant  to  the  success  of  the  ISS  National  Laboratory.  It  is  not  ap-

parent how ISS science endeavors can be implemented by relying only on funds re-
directed from within agencies with relatively flat budgets.

In strengthening the pipeline of biomedical research that requires ISS utilization,
it  is  further  recommended  that  NASA  permit  the  National  Space  Biomedical  Re-
search Institute (NSBRI) to be more engaged in transitioning and managing science
and  technology  development  for  the  ISS.  The  1996  NASA  Cooperative  Agreement
Notice  9–CAN–96–01,  ‘‘Soliciting  Proposals  for  the  Establishment  of  the  National
Space  Biomedical  Research  Institute,’’  states  in  Section  7.0,  and  reiterates  in  Sec-
tion  10.4,  that  ‘‘it  is  NASA’s  intent  that  responsibility  for  all  appropriate  NASA-
sponsored  Space  Station  human  experiment  opportunities  be  transferred  to  the  In-
stitute.’’  Although  NSBRI  is  NASA’s  primary  partner  for  biomedical  research,  and
has  multiple  international  collaborations,  NASA  has  not  utilized  the  resources  and
expertise  of  NSBRI  to  help  review,  select  or  manage  research  for  the  ISS.  This  is
an area that should be revisited.
Q2. NASA  has  developed  a  Human  Research  Program  Utilization  Plan  for  the  ISS,
which  identifies  the  risks  for  human  exploration  of  space  and  the  research  on
the ISS that can help mitigate the risks and lead to the development of counter-
measures.

Q2a. Do  NASA’s  current  plans  for  ISS  utilization  enable  the  agency  to  adequately

address the risks outlined in the plan and to develop countermeasures?

A2a. NASA’s  ‘‘Human  Research  Program  Utilization  Plan  for  the  International
Space Station’’ identifies 25 human health and performance risks requiring the ISS
in  order  to  perform  research  needed  to  quantify  the  risks  and  validate  counter-
measures and technologies. For each risk, there is a brief description of the planned
activities  and  a  top-level  schedule,  wherein  a  significant  portion  of  the  proposed
work will be completed by 2016. Some risk assessment and countermeasure valida-
tion will occur beyond this date.

As stated in the document, the plan is subject to change based on multiple consid-
erations.  Nevertheless,  in  its  current  instantiation,  the  plan  summarizes  important
risks  and  the  development  of  countermeasures.  Some  risk  areas  are  described  in
more detail than others, but in general, limited information is provided in the docu-
ment.

NASA’s  current  plans  for  ISS  utilization  enable  the  agency  to  address  the  risks.
The  question  is  what  constitutes  adequate  risk  mitigation?  It  is  apparent  that  a
more detailed, integrated utilization plan is needed to ensure as much progress and
success as possible within the proposed time frame.
Q2b. If not, what else needs to be done?
A2b. Items to be done are listed as recommendations for the Human Research Pro-
gram Utilization Plan for the ISS:

• Prioritize the risks into categories to identify those among the 25 that are the

most urgent to mitigate utilizing the unique capabilities of the ISS;

• Expand each risk section to provide a more comprehensive listing of proposed

research, countermeasures and technologies;1

• Characterize  the  current  pipeline  of  biomedical  projects  feeding  into,  and  al-
ready approved as part of, the portfolio of research, development, testing and
evaluation to be conducted aboard the ISS;

• Identify  current  science  and  technology  gaps  in  the  risk  reduction  plan  uti-

• Outline the flight resources and manifest opportunities;
• Describe  current  and  planned  experiment  hardware  and  associated  engineer-

lizing the ISS;2

ing needs;

1 For  example,  ISS  research  to  address  the  first  risk  in  the  plan,  ‘‘Risk  of  Inability  to  Ade-
quately Treat an Ill or Injured Crew Member,’’ is scheduled for FY08, FY09 and FY11. It would
be helpful to list all relevant technologies at high readiness levels for flight that are candidates
for  testing  and  evaluation  aboard  ISS.  Near  infrared  spectroscopy  for  non-invasive  blood  and
tissue  chemistry,  and  in-flight  blood  lab-on-a-chip  technology  for  astronaut  health  monitoring
are  two  such  technologies.  While  both  projects  are  currently  funded  by  NSBRI,  neither  project
is identified in the plan.

2 This  is  important  to  do  now  as  there  is  often  a  significant  lead  time  to  procure  the  needed

studies and mature them to ISS-ready status.

• Discuss opportunities for integration and added value among studies address-
• Depict the roles and extent of industry involvement in the enterprise;
• Estimate the crew time dedicated to participate in research activities;
• Describe  the  metrics  to  be  used  to  assess  risk  mitigation  effectiveness  and
• Address plans for data sharing;
• Address plans for how intellectual property will be handled;
• Expand on issues concerning ISS partner participation;
• Discuss how research, development, testing and evaluation will be supported.
Q3. In  your  prepared  statement,  you  indicate  that  affordable  and  reliable  access  to
and from the ISS are key to the success of conducting biomedical research. You
go on to say that critical to this success is the availability of cost-effective trans-
portation  services.  How  critical  is  a  down  mass  capability  for  biomedical  re-
search?

A3. The physical return of samples and other materials is critical to the success and
reproducibility  of  biomedical  experiments  aboard  the  ISS.  Down  mass  capability  is
essential  to  guarantee  the  quality  of  certain  types  of  biological  specimens  (fluids,
cells and tissue) being returned to Earth. Access to powered, large-volume, pressur-
ized lockers for transport is necessary.

Given  the  need  for  this  capability,  whenever  possible,  it  is  anticipated  that  on-
orbit  resources  would  be  utilized  to  characterize  findings,  and  that  digital  data
would be down-linked to Earth. In my verbal testimony, I referred to the successful
use  of  on-orbit  ultrasound  to  perform  medical  imaging  on  ISS  crew  members.
Streamed video and still images of clinical quality from a series of studies were ob-
tained without the need for down mass capability.

The U.S. orbiter and the Russian Soyuz have served as the primary means to en-
sure  safe  return  of  biomedical  samples  from  research  conducted  aboard  the  ISS.
Both  vehicles  are  capable  of  providing  powered  mid-deck  locker  return,  when  nec-
essary, for valuable experimental materials. It is desirable to have configurable soft-
packs when power and/or pressurization is not necessary.

The  transfer  vehicles  in  development  by  international  partners  (the  European
ATV  and  the  Japanese  HTV)  do  not  provide  down  mass  capability.  Although  these
vehicles play an important role in delivery of cargo to the ISS, their utility for trans-
ferring  experimental  samples  and  other  materials  from  the  ISS  to  Earth  is  absent.
Similar  to  the  conditions  provided  by  the  orbiter  and  Soyuz,  the  Space  X  Dragon
capsule,  currently  under  development  for  NASA’s  Commercial  Orbital  Transpor-
tation Services program, is expected to be able to accommodate both pressurized and
non-pressurized  cargo  in  a  mid-deck  locker-like  configuration.  Other  developments
are also in progress.
Q4. Given  your  experience  in  leading  an  institute  that  involves  universities,  federal
agencies,  and  industry  in  conducting  research  to  support  human  space  explo-
ration, what should NASA consider as it explores options for managing the ISS
National Lab?

A4. NASA should consider management options for the ISS National Lab that have
been  successfully  implemented  in  other  large-scale,  ambitious  research  and  engi-
neering  projects  of  national  and  international  importance.  Within  NASA,  excellent
examples include the Apollo and Hubble Space Telescope programs. There are many
non-NASA  examples,  including  the  Manhattan  Project,  which  exemplify  how  out-
standing  scientists  have  been  brought  together  to  work  on  teams,  with  an  upper-
level management structure guiding and integrating teams to achieve a single com-
mon purpose of paramount significance.

3 For instance, NSBRI is supporting a project to develop an ultrasound catalog for autonomous
medical  care.  The  catalog  will  provide,  among  other  deliverables,  an  atlas  of  normal  human
anatomy  and  physiology  acquired  using  ultrasound  aboard  the  ISS,  starting  with  Expedition  6.
Studies should continue on this project which addresses multiple risks, including but not limited
to  the  ‘‘Risk  of  Inability  to  Adequately  Treat  an  Ill  or  Injured  Crew  Member,’’  ‘‘Risk  of  Acceler-
ated  Osteoporosis,’’  ‘‘Risk  of  Cardiac  Rhythm  Problems,’’  and  ‘‘Risk  of  Intervertebral  Disc  Dam-
age.’’

4 All  projects  within  the  Human  Research  Program  can  be  assigned  countermeasure  and/or
technology  readiness  levels.  The  rate  of  change  of  these  levels  with  time  provides  an  estimate
of  when  projects  are  ready  for  flight  testing  and  evaluation.  Not  all  projects  mature  to  flight
and  some  projects  enter  the  system  as  flight  studies.  There  are  also  other  measures  to  charac-
terize the pipeline beyond readiness levels and their time rate of change.

There is not necessarily a single, best way to manage the ISS National Lab. Sub-
stantial  resources  exist,  and  more  are  being  put  into  place,  aboard  the  ISS.  There
is  a  wealth  of  biomedical  research  and  technological  infrastructure  within  univer-
sities, medical schools, industry and government laboratories to enable ISS National
Lab  achievements.  As  mentioned  previously,  there  is  a  cadre  of  outstanding  inves-
tigators who have, and students who are acquiring, the necessary skills to generate
productive  and  meaningful  discoveries  in  space,  in  partnership  with  ISS  crews.
Funding, reliable access to and from the ISS, and international limitations are chal-
lenging issues but fundamentally solvable.

Two  items  that  NASA  should  focus  on  regarding  management  are  requirements
and  leadership.  A  strategic  and  tactical  plan  that  is  consistent  with,  but  includes
more  detail  than  the  reports  presently  available  on  the  ISS  National  Lab,  should
be  developed,  with  particular  attention  paid  to  requirements.  The  management  op-
tions  are  narrowed  by  considering  only  those  systems  that  allow  the  requirements
to be met. In formulating the strategic and tactical plan, it can be useful to assem-
ble  a  small  working  group  of  NASA  and  non-NASA  experts,  whose  membership  in-
cludes experience in leading large scientific institutes, conducting basic and applied
biomedical  research  in  space,  partnering  with  industry  and  successfully  imple-
menting international science and technology programs. Attention should be paid to
the  needs  and  expectations  of  key  stakeholders,  and  the  plan  should  be  thoroughly
vetted before being implemented.

Leadership  is  a  key  consideration  for  success  in  managing  the  ISS  National  Lab.
The  Director  should  possess  not  only  the  necessary  credentials,  experience,  skills
and  integrity  to  perform  his  or  her  duties,  but  must  also  have  a  bold  vision  for  the
ISS National Lab that is embraced by NASA, other federal agencies, Congress, and
to  the  greatest  extent  possible,  the  American  public.  The  ISS  National  Lab  must
have  a  strong  leadership  team  to  effectively  implement  the  strategic  and  tactical
plan,  and  to  modify  the  plan  accordingly,  in  order  to  achieve  maximum  return  on,
and benefit from, our Nation’s investment in the ISS and its precious resources.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. At  the  hearing,  you  outlined  a  number  of  initiatives  conducted  by  the  National
Space  Biomedical  Research  Institute  related  to  developing  countermeasures  for
long-term  human  exploration  of  space.  Which  among  these  has  generated  the
most  promise,  and  which,  in  your  opinion,  continues  to  pose  the  greatest  chal-
lenges?

A1. Ten  NSBRI-sponsored  science  and  technology  projects,  all  generating  substan-
tial promise, are highlighted in my prepared statement. Three are described in more
detail  here  to  illustrate  the  extent  of  promise  within  NSBRI’s  portfolio.  This  is  fol-
lowed by remarks concerning an NSBRI initiative, which despite considerable prom-
ise, poses great challenges.

NSBRI  took  a  strong  position  in  enhancing  near-infrared  spectroscopy  analysis
and  subsequently  developing  a  small,  lightweight,  portable  means  of  performing
non-invasive  blood  and  tissue  measurements  for  use  in  space.5 By  assessing  tissue
pH and lactic acid in real-time during exercise, it is possible to adapt exercise coun-
termeasures and efficiencies for individual crew members. This device has been test-
ed  on  astronauts  exercising  at  Johnson  Space  Center,  and  the  technology  is  matur-
ing  toward  evaluation  aboard  the  ISS.  There  are  medical  applications  for  space  ex-
ploration  (e.g.,  assessing  tissue  viability  in  the  case  of  a  crush  injury  or  exposure
to  extreme  temperatures)  and  applications  to  health  care  on  Earth  (e.g.,  assessing
the microvasculature in diabetics).

Light in the blue part of the spectrum is being used as a countermeasure for per-
formance errors associated with circadian desynchronization, sleep loss and adapta-
tion to shifts in work schedule. NSBRI has sponsored research published in leading
journals,  such  as  Science  and  Nature,  delineating  mechanisms  associated  with  blue
light effects. The Institute has also taken the lead in developing, testing and evalu-
ating  the  countermeasure  in  operational  settings,  and  in  working  with  NASA  to
modify  the  lighting  in  designs  for  the  crew  exploration  vehicle.  There  are  several
applications of this countermeasure on Earth.

NSBRI assessed the utility of several portable medical imaging technologies (dual
energy  X-ray  absorptiometry,  magnetic  resonance  imaging,  diffuse  optical  tomog-
raphy  and  ultrasound)  for  use  in  space.  In  partnership  with  NASA,  a  series  of  ele-
gant  studies  were  performed  aboard  ISS  using  ultrasound,  which  has  become  the

5 The  device  is  reminiscent  of  the  medical  tricorder  used  by  Dr.  McCoy  in  the  fictional  series

Star Trek.

medical imaging technology of choice. NSBRI therefore shifted its portfolio to reflect
the  promise  of  ultrasound,  and  currently  supports  novel  countermeasure  develop-
ment  projects  using  scanning  confocal  ultrasound  and  high-intensity  focused
ultrasound (HIFU). HIFU shows particular promise in addressing the risk of inabil-
ity to adequately treat an ill or injured crew member. NSBRI has co-sponsored, with
the  Department  of  Defense,  a  small  portable  ultrasound  system  capable  of  sensing
and then (using autonomous image guidance) performing non-invasive surgery with
HIFU.6 This countermeasure, employing an integrated sensor-effector platform, has
applications on Earth in emergency medicine and on the battlefield.

One of the most challenging risks to mitigate, for human space exploration, is the
harmful effects of radiation. A recent report from the National Research Council, en-
titled ‘‘Managing Space Radiation Risk in the New Era of Space Exploration’’ (2008),
provides an insightful assessment of the risk and efforts to protect against exposure
to space radiation. NSBRI supports NASA’s radiation program in several ways.7 The
Institute  funds  the  development  of  gas  and  solid-state  dosimeters  for  real-time  as-
sessment of radiation exposure to astronauts. This is particularly important for mis-
sions beyond low Earth orbit. A number of projects on NSBRI teams, such as those
dealing  with  bone  and  the  cardiovascular  system,  have  a  radiation  component.
Countermeasures are being investigated to protect against the harmful effects of ra-
diation to these and other systems.

Perhaps the most significant contribution of NSBRI in addressing radiation risks
is  a  new  initiative  addressing  the  mitigation  of  effects  due  to  acute  radiation  expo-
sure. In February 2008, NSBRI released an announcement ‘‘Research Opportunities
Soliciting  an  NSBRI  Center  of  Acute  Radiation  Research  for  Ground-Based  Studies
on  Acute  Radiation  Effects.’’ 8 The  goal  is  to  develop  countermeasures  to  acute  ef-
fects  that  could  potentially  compromise  crew  members  and  even  the  mission  itself.
Countermeasure development in this area is challenging, but it is an essential part
of supporting long-duration, human exploration of space.

6 See http://www.nsbri.org/Research/Projects/viewsummary.epl?pid=158
7 It  is  worth  noting  that  NASA’s  radiation  program,  within  the  Human  Research  Program,  is
supported  at  an  amount  that  is  50  percent  greater  than  the  entire  NSBRI.  To  accomplish  its
mission, the Institute relies on its ability to leverage resources in innovative ways.

STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR

GRAVITATIONAL AND SPACE BIOLOGY

ASGSB PRESIDENT, DANNY A. RILEY, PH.D.

PROFESSOR OF CELL BIOLOGY, NEUROBIOLOGY AND ANATOMY

MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN

The  American  Society  for  Gravitational  and  Space  Biology  (ASGSB),  founded  in
1984,  provides  a  forum  to  foster  research,  education  and  professional  development
in  the  multidisciplinary  fields  of  gravitational  and  space  biology.  We  are  a  diverse
group of scientists, engineers and students who exchange ideas that bridge basic and
applied  biological  research  in  space  and  gravitational  sciences.  Our  society  of  ∼350
professionals  and  students  from  universities,  government,  and  industry  represents
the  core  community  that  works  with  NASA  to  create  and  disseminate  knowledge
about how living organisms respond to gravity and the space flight environs.

For many years, our members have worked toward the reality of an International
Space  Station  (ISS)  as  a  platform  for  conducting  the  cutting  edge  research,  as  de-
scribed  in  the  multiple  National  Research  Council  (NRC)  reports.1 We  consider  the
ISS National Laboratory an essential and unique tool for probing biological function
and  adaptation  during  long-term  space  flight.  The  studies  are  essential  for  human
space exploration and, at the same time, return multiple health and economic bene-
fits to America. There is no substitute on earth. Moreover, the U.S. has already in-
vested  at  least  $100  billion  in  the  ISS.  This  is  not  the  time  for  us  to  abandon  the
investment or the opportunity.

Our Society has been decimated by the unprecedented retraction and termination
of  funding  of  non-exploration  fundamental  biology.  The  viability  of  our  community
is foundationally linked to the ability to conduct cutting edge research on ISS.
The  American  Society  for  Gravitational  and  Space  Biology  considers  the
following  elements  ESSENTIAL  to  make  the  International  Space  Station
productive for research:

Viable ASGSB research community

• Substantial and long-term commitment of NASA to fund fundamental biology

ground and flight research programs

• Active  community  of  plant  and  animal  scientists  and  engineers  engaged  in

world class, fundamental and applied space research

• Stable  research  and  training  environments  to  attract  and  educate  next  gen-

eration scientists and engineers

• Continuous  pipeline  of  meritorious,  peer-reviewed  investigations  encom-
passing fundamental and applied research in space-related biological sciences

ISS Resources and Environment

• Hardware  and  instrumentation  to  support  animal  and  plant  housing  and  ex-
perimentation  on  ISS,  including  bio-containment  work  stations  and  variable
speed centrifugation capabilities

• Frequent and affordable transportation to and from ISS
• Commercial and basic research entities participating jointly on missions
• Ground personnel and facilities support for flight experiments
• Crew member involvement in the conduct of investigations

ISS National Laboratory Management

• Empowered and budgeted administrative unit within NASA to fund and inte-
grate the flight hardware and science for non-exploration fundamental biology
• An ISS National Laboratory management unit, a consortium of stakeholders,
tightly coupled with external advisory and peer review to implement NRC-de-
fined research priorities

• External  science  advisory  structure  with  oversight  and  influence  on  NASA

programmatic priority decisions

To  revitalize  and  establish  all  of  these  elements  requires  immediate  atten-
tion,  time  and  a  renewed  national  commitment  as  well  as  supportive  lead-
ership at NASA Headquarters.

ASGSB  life  scientists  have  conferred  extensively  with  their  counterparts  in  the
physical  sciences.  The  consensus  is  that,  for  the  U.S.  to  prevent  the  utter  destruc-
tion  of  the  human  capital  and  living  knowledge  in  the  space  life  and  physical
sciences,  there  must  be  an  infusion  of  ‘‘keep  alive’’  funds  in  2009.  We  jointly  esti-
mate  such  ‘‘keep  alive  funds’’  at  $91M  for  the  coming  fiscal  year.  Such  funds  must
be  assigned  to  ‘‘non-exploration  research’’  in  the  space  life  and  physical  sciences  at
NASA.  Moreover,  for  NASA  to  engage  in  the  mandated  ‘‘America  COMPETES’’  ini-
tiative,  $160M  of  additional  funds  are  required  for  the  life  and  physical  sciences  at
NASA.

It is ironic that the loss of financial support for the life sciences and our research
on the ISS began in 2004, immediately after President Bush announced the ‘‘Vision
for  Space  Exploration’’  and  asserted  that  the  ISS  would  be  completed  because  the
U.S. finishes what we start. He also recognized explicitly that we must use the ISS
to  learn  about  long-term  space  exposure  on  the  body,  in  order  to  venture  safely  and
successfully into space.

Failure to utilize fully U.S. investment in the space station and neglecting, to the
point  of  destruction,  the  ASGSB  community  is  antithetical  to  competitive  national
goals  and  interests.  We  look  forward  to  working  with  Congress  to  regain  American
leadership  in  the  space  enterprise  and  to  continue  to  make  great  contributions  to
health  and  knowledge  while  cultivating  the  next  generation  of  scientists  and  engi-
neers.
