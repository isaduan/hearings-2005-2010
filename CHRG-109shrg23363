TUESDAY,  APRIL  12,  2005

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:28  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Ted  Stevens,
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE,

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

Senator  INOUYE.  At  the  direction  and  instructions  of  the  Chair, 
I  want  to  welcome  all  the  nominees  with  us  today  and  especially 
the  families.  You  have  a  lot  to  be  proud  of,  and  I  know  that  this 
is a very important day for all of you. And so I will place my state-
ment on each nominee in the record, because I think we would like 
to expedite the hearings. I will have a few questions, but those, too, 
will be made part of the record. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Inouye follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE,

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

I want to welcome Dr. Michael Griffin, the President’s nominee to be the next Ad-
ministrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Dr. Grif-
fin brings with him an impressive resume and extensive experience in both the pub-
lic  and  private  sector.  I  am  confident  that  Dr.  Griffin  will  leverage  this  experience 
to get NASA back on track. 

Dr.  Griffin’s  major  challenge  will  be  returning  credibility  to  NASA.  There  are 
issues with returning to flight, competition from other countries, and striking an ap-
propriate balance in science, and with fiscal responsibility. 

It has been over two years since the Columbia Shuttle disaster and NASA is still 

feeling the effects. 

Dr.  Griffin,  you  will  take  the  reins  at  an  agency  that  is  dedicated  to  returning 
the shuttle safely to flight. However, in recent weeks, we have heard concerns from 
members  of  the  Stafford-Covey  team,  NASA  engineers,  and  other  members  of  the 
NASA family. You are in the unenviable position of having to sign off on the safety 
of  the  flight  without  having  had  the  opportunity  to  oversee  the  implementation  of 
the Columbia Accident Investigation Board’s recommendations. Space flight is never 
without  risk,  but  I  hope  you  will  take  the  time  to  assure  yourself  that  our  astro-
nauts face the minimum risk possible when heading into space.

NASA  and  the  United  States  are  facing  competition  from  other  countries  looking 
to  establish  a  presence  in  orbit.  China  recently  put  a  man  into  space  and  plans  to 
build  a  space  station.  Japan  just  announced  a  20-year  initiative  to  go  to  the  moon. 
In  addition,  we  are  already  aware  of  Europe  and  Russia’s  space-faring  capabili-
ties. Our presence in space is not only a matter of national prestige, but of strategic 
importance.  This  is  clearly  an  area  where  we  not  only  have  to  compete,  but  lead, 
and the leadership will need to come from NASA. 

As  the  agency  pursues  exploration,  NASA  should  not  sacrifice  its  scientific  pur-
suits. NASA is one of this country’s leading scientific agencies, which over the years 
has made major contributions to science and aeronautics. Robotic missions to Mars, 
the  numerous  space  telescopes  that  beam  back  magnificent  images  of  the  universe, 
and Earth science satellites are all examples of how NASA can produce valuable dis-
coveries  without  endangering  human  life.  I  hope  that  Dr.  Griffin  shares  my  view 
on the importance of NASA’s commitment to basic science. 

As  I  mentioned  earlier,  Dr.  Griffin  has  several  major  challenges  awaiting  him  at 
NASA.  Fiscal  responsibility  and  credibility  is  perhaps  the  most  fundamental  chal-
lenge.  The  agency  has  a  dismal  record  when  it  comes  to  estimating  costs.  Auditors 
have  been  unable  to  certify  the  agency’s  accounting  books  in  three  out  of  the  last 
four  years,  and  Congress  has  been  told  not  to  expect  a  clean  audit  for  Fiscal  Year 
2005. NASA needs to be on sound financial footing as it goes forward with the Presi-
dent’s Vision for Exploration. 

While Congress often focuses on the negative, I would be remiss in closing without 
saying  that  Dr.  Griffin  takes  the  helm  of  a  great  agency.  The  men  and  women  of 
NASA are redefining what is possible. I look forward to working with you, Dr. Grif-
fin, to help NASA respond to the challenges it faces. 

I  welcome  Commissioner  Joe  Boardman  here  today  as  we  consider  his  appoint-
ment  as  Administrator  of  the  Federal  Railroad  Administration  (FRA).  Mr. 
Boardman presently heads the New York State Department of Transportation. I un-
derstand that Mr. Boardman is considered a leader on rail issues among state trans-
portation  officials  and  we  look  forward  to  learning  more  about  him  and  working 
with him. 

Several  recent  high  profile  railroad  accidents  have  raised  this  Committee’s  con-
cern  and  Mr.  Boardman  will  have  many  challenges,  including,  strengthening  the 
safety of our nation’s railroads. 

Amtrak faces yet another crisis this year, in part due to the Administration’s pro-
posal  to  zero-out  Amtrak  and  bankrupt  the  railroad.  We  are  all  anxious  to  learn 
your  thoughts  on  reauthorizing  Amtrak  and  your  opinion  of  the  Administration’s 
plans for radical restructuring or bankruptcy.

Senator  INOUYE.  We  have  several  of  our  colleagues  here,  so  we 
would like to hear from them. May I call upon my dear friend, Paul 
Sarbanes? Senator Sarbanes of Maryland. 

STATEMENT OF HON. PAUL S. SARBANES,

U.S. SENATOR FROM MARYLAND 

Senator  SARBANES.  Well,  thank  you  very  much,  Senator  Inouye 

and Members of the Committee. 

I  have  come  with  my  esteemed  colleague,  Senator  Mikulski,  to 
introduce a highly respected leader in Maryland’s scientific commu-
nity,  Dr.  Michael  Griffin,  who  is  the  President’s  nominee  to  serve 
as  the  next  Administrator  of  NASA.  We  think  this  is  just  an  out-
standing nomination. 

Dr.  Griffin  is  a  native  of  Maryland,  born  in  Aberdeen,  the  home 
of  Cal  Ripken,  Jr.,  I  might  note,  for  whatever  relevance  that  has 
to the hearing. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator SARBANES. And he has been educated in some of our na-
tion’s  finest  academic  institutions.  He  has  his  Bachelor  of  Arts  de-
gree  in  Physics  from  the  Johns  Hopkins  University,  and  he  has 
earned five master’s degrees; Aerospace Science from Catholic Uni-
versity,  Electrical  Engineering  from  the  University  of  Southern 
California,  Applied  Physics  from  Johns  Hopkins,  Civil  Engineering

from  George  Washington  University,  and  Business  Administration 
from Loyola College of Maryland. He also earned his Ph.D. in Aero-
space Engineering from the University of Maryland. So, as you can 
see, Dr. Griffin is literally, quite literally, a rocket scientist. 

He  is  currently  the  Space  Department  Head  of  the  Johns  Hop-
kins  University  Applied  Physics  Laboratory  in  Howard  County, 
Maryland. Johns Hopkins APL is a nonprofit division of the Johns 
Hopkins  University,  and,  under  the  strong  leadership  of  Dr.  Rich-
ard  Rocca,  serves  as  one  of  the  premier  research  and  development 
institutions  in  the  nation.  For  almost  50  years,  APL’s  Space  Divi-
sion  has  played  a  central  role  in  supporting  our  nation’s  civilian 
and  military  space  programs.  And  they  have  carried  out  any  num-
ber of very, very important scientific endeavors there. 

The  New  York  Times  put  it  well  in  an  editorial  strongly  sup-
porting  Dr.  Griffin’s  nomination,  entitled  very  simply  but  appro-
priately, ‘‘A Talented Leader.’’ He has held a number of leadership 
positions during his long career in both the public and private sec-
tors. They have demanded an extraordinarily high level of both sci-
entific  excellence  and  administrative  capabilities.  And  he  has  met 
those challenges at a very high standard. 

Currently  the  head  of  APL’s  Space  Division,  Mike  Griffin  over-
sees  a  staff  of  over  600  employees,  and  a  budget  well  in  excess  of 
$200  million.  He  has,  of  course,  had  very  important  experience  at 
NASA  in  the  upper  echelons  as  both  the  Chief  Engineer  and  the 
Associate  Administrator  for  Exploration.  He  has  held  important 
management  positions  in  the  private  sector.  In  addition  to  his  ad-
ministrative  and  research  interests,  he  has  continued  to  do  impor-
tant academic work. He continues to serve as an adjunct professor 
at Maryland and Hopkins. 

I need not mention to this Committee the challenges faced in the 
space  program.  We  think  that  the  expertise  and  the  passion  that 
Mike Griffin brings to the job is exactly what is needed. 

I  am  very  pleased  to  come  before  the  Committee  today  to  very 
strongly  endorse  his  nomination.  And  I  very  much  hope  the  Com-
mittee can act expeditiously and favorably on this nomination. 

Thank you very much. 
Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much, Senator Sarbanes. 
I must apologize to my colleagues. I forgot to call upon them. 
Senator McCain, do you have any statement? 
Senator MCCAIN. No, thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator INOUYE. Senator Lautenberg? 
Senator LAUTENBERG. I would like to proffer some remarks after 

we have heard from our friends at——

Senator INOUYE. All right. Senator Hutchison? 
Senator  HUTCHISON.  I  will  also  make  remarks  following  the  wit-
nesses at the witness table. I would like to make an opening state-
ment as Chairman of the NASA and——

Senator INOUYE. OK. Senator Nelson of Florida? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON,

U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Senator  NELSON.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  just  think  Dr.  Griffin  is  an 
outstanding  choice.  I  think  he  is  going  to  be  a  breath  of  fresh  air. 
And not only does he, in fact, bring the credentials to the table that

he  is,  in  fact,  a  rocket  scientist,  he  carries  himself  with  great  hu-
mility.  And  I  think  that  is  going  to  fit  very  well  with  the  NASA 
family. 

Senator INOUYE. Senator Mikulski. 

STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA A. MIKULSKI,

U.S. SENATOR FROM MARYLAND 

Senator MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Senator Inouye and to 

members of the panel. 

I  am  here  really  under  two  flags:  One,  the  proud  flag  of  Mary-
land, talking about one of Maryland’s favorite sons, Dr. Mike Grif-
fin,  to  be  nominated  for  the  NASA  Administrator,  and  then  the 
other  as  the  Ranking  Member  on  the  Senate  Appropriations  Com-
mittee  who  has  responsibility  for  the  funding  of  NASA  programs. 
I  want  to  thank  President  Bush  for  nominating  such  an  out-
standing candidate to head up NASA at this time of great strategic 
importance for NASA’s future and also the fact that the NASA Ad-
ministrator  has  to  deal  with  the  long-range  plans  and  the  short-
range crises that we are now facing. 

Under the Maryland flag, as Senator Sarbanes said, Mike Griffin 
is  really  a  hometown  guy,  coming  from  Aberdeen,  the  home  of  Cal 
Ripken,  Jr.  What  is  important  about  that  is  he  brings  those,  what 
we  call,  those  Ripken  values,  that  Ripken  way,  to  NASA.  What 
does  that  mean?  To  be  the  best  of  what  you  best  can  be  and  to 
work hard at it, to concentrate with a high level and degree of com-
petence, but at the same time to put values into action, playing by 
the  rules,  serving  your  community,  and  being  an  outstanding  cit-
izen. This is what Mike Griffin has done. He has gone to our local 
schools;  Aberdeen  High  School,  Johns  Hopkins,  Loyola,  Maryland. 
He  has  five  master’s  degrees  in  a  variety  of  engineering  and  phys-
ics,  and  also  even  an  MBA  from  Loyola  College.  Much  has  been 
made  over  the  fact  that  he  is  a  rocket  scientist.  Thank  God  that 
we are really going to have someone who understands what this is 
all about. 

Because  the  very  safety  of  our  astronauts  will  depend  on  the 
quality  of  this  NASA  Administrator,  as  we  get  ready  to  return  to 
flight.  Much  has  been  made  over  the  fact  that  he  worked  at  the 
Johns  Hopkins  Applied  Physics  Lab,  heading  their  Space  Depart-
ment,  knowing  what  earth  science  means,  knowing  what  space 
science  means,  and  knowing  what  it  means  to  be  a  contractor  and 
to meet the bottom line while serving the nation. 

Dr.  Griffin  brings  a  variety  of  experiences  from  within  govern-
ment, within the Applied Physics Lab, as well as the private sector, 
with  the  Magellan  Systems  and  the  Orbiter  Systems.  And  he  even 
ran a nonprofit company for the CIA, when the CIA created a non-
profit  venture  capital  firm,  to  search  for  new  technologies  that 
would  serve  the  nation.  He  is  a  rare  combination  of  a  scientist,  an 
engineer, and a manager. 

Dear  colleagues,  as  the  Commerce  Committee  knows,  NASA  is 
facing enormous challenges right now; The need to return to flight 
safely. We need to send our astronauts not only back into space but 
to return them safely. We need to be able to finish that Space Sta-
tion. I, of course, want to save the Hubble and hope that Dr. Griffin 
is  an  able  partner  in  that.  We  need  to  see  how  they  are  going  to

implement the Moon/Mars Initiative, at the same time revise aero-
nautics, which is so crucial. I am sick and tired of being beaten by 
Airbus. I want to win Nobel prizes. I want to win the markets. And 
I want a NASA Administrator who can do that. 

This is what I think Mike Griffin will help be able to do, a frame-
work  where  we  meet  the  immediate  crises  facing  us,  but  at  the 
same time look to the long-range needs of our country. 

So  I  am  proud  to  introduce  him  as  both  a  Marylander  and  the 
Ranking Member on the Senate Appropriations Committee now re-
sponsible.  And  also,  I  want  to  thank—while  Dr.  Griffin  has  served 
the nation, his wonderful wife, Rebecca, has been behind him. And 
we  know  that  behind  every  great  rocket  scientist  was  the  woman 
who provided the rocket. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator MIKULSKI. So thank you very much. And I hope that we 

send his nomination forward quickly. 

Senator INOUYE. How can we say no? 
Senator Schumer? 

STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. SCHUMER,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW YORK 

Senator  SCHUMER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I  want  to 
thank  the  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  am  delighted  and  proud 
to  introduce  someone  who  is  not  a  rocket  scientist,  but  an  expert 
on  transportation  and  administration,  to  the  Committee.  And  that 
is Joseph H. Boardman of New York. 

He is currently the Commissioner of the New York State Depart-
ment of Transportation. He is the nominee to be the next Adminis-
trator  of  the  Federal  Railroad  Administration.  I’ve  known  Joe  for 
a  long  time.  We  have  worked  closely  together  on  many  transpor-
tation  projects  in  New  York  State,  and  I  think  he  will  do  a  great 
job at FRA. And I recommend him wholeheartedly, as does my col-
league, Senator Clinton, who could not be here today. 

Joe  has  been  the  head  of  the  New  York  State  Department  of 
Transportation for the last 7 years. He made a lifetime of working 
to  make  all  modes  of  New  York’s  transportation  system  safer  and 
more  efficient.  He  is  a  hometown  boy,  as  well,  for  us.  He  is  a  life-
long  New  Yorker.  He  worked  his  way  up.  He  is  from  the  Mohawk 
Valley  in  upstate  New  York,  where  my  dad  was  raised.  He  has 
worked his way up from being manager of both the Transportation 
and  Parking  Authorities  of  Rome,  New  York,  to  Commissioner  of 
Public  Transportation  in  Broome  County,  in  which  Binghamton 
lies,  to  finally  becoming  the  Commissioner  of  Transportation  in 
1997. 

And New York has one of the largest and most complex transpor-
tation systems in the country. Throughout these experiences, Com-
missioner  Boardman  showed  that  he  possessed  the  unique  knowl-
edge  of  how  essential,  safe,  fast,  and  easily  accessible  transpor-
tation  is  vital  to  local  communities  and  to  economic  growth  of  en-
tire states, regions, and across the country. I am proud to say that, 
as  Commissioner,  Joe  has  expanded  Amtrak  service  across  New 
York,  presiding  over  record  growth  in  ridership.  He  has  enhanced 
his  department’s  ability  to  inspect  and  crack  down  on  rail  safety

violations and made safety a top priority. He is going to need these 
two traits. 

Before  I  sat  down  with  the  Commissioner  and  spoke  with  him, 
he  assured  me  he  would  fight  hard  for  Amtrak.  We  all  know  that 
is  going  to  be  a  big,  big  fight  in  the  Senate  this  year  and  in  the 
budget.  And  furthermore,  with  the  recent  revelations  of  safety 
lapses  in  our  rail  system,  particularly  our  freight  rail  system,  he 
has  assured  me  he  would  focus  on  that.  The  FRA,  I  think,  has  a 
little  bit  lost  its  way  in  that  area  over  the  last  few  years.  And  I 
think Joe Boardman will bring it up to snuff. 

So  he  is  a  thoughtful,  knowledgeable,  and  dedicated  transpor-
tation  official.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  him.  I  am  proud  to 
endorse his nomination and introduce him to this very, very special 
Committee. 

Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much, Senator Schumer.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. SCHUMER,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW YORK 

Chairman  Stevens,  Ranking  Member  Inouye,  and  Committee  Members,  I  am 
proud  and  delighted  to  introduce  Joseph  H.  Boardman  of  New  York,  current  Com-
missioner  of  the  New  York  State  Department  of  Transportation  and  nominee  to  be 
the  next  Administrator  of  the  Federal  Railroad  Administration.  I  know  that  Com-
missioner  Boardman  will  do  a  great  job  at  the  FRA  and  recommended  his  nomina-
tion wholeheartedly. 

Commissioner  Boardman  has  been  head  of  NYSDOT  for  the  last  seven  years, 
after  a  lifetime  of  working  to  make  of  New  York’s  transportation  system  safer  and 
more  efficient.  A  lifelong  New  Yorker,  born  and  raised  on  a  dairy  farm  in  Oneida 
County,  Commissioner  Boardman  worked  his  way  up  from  being  manager  of  both 
the Transportation and Parking Authorities of Rome, NY, to Commissioner of Public 
Transportation  in  Broome  County,  to  finally  becoming  Commissioner  of  Transpor-
tation in 1997 of one of the largest and most complex transportation systems in the 
country. 

Through these experiences, Commissioner Boardman possesses unique knowledge 
of  how  essential  safe,  fast,  and  easily  accessible  transportation  is  to  local  commu-
nities  and  to  the  economic  growth  of  entire  states,  regions,  and  across  the  country. 
As  Commissioner,  Commissioner  Boardman  has  expanded  Amtrak  service  across 
New  York,  presiding  over  record  growth  in  ridership,  enhanced  his  Department’s 
ability  to  inspect  and  crack  down  on  rail  safety  violations,  and  made  safety  a  top 
priority at both the state and national levels. 

Rail safety and the preservation of Amtrak are the two most pressing issues con-
fronting Commissioner Boardman as he takes the reigns of the FRA. I have full con-
fidence  that  Commissioner  Boardman  will  be  an  ally  in  the  fight  to  make  our  rail 
lines  safer,  though  the  use  of  tougher  regulation,  heavier  penalties  for  negligent 
railroad companies, and the expansion of available modern technology. 

Commissioner Boardman is a thoughtful, knowledgeable, and dedicated transpor-
tation official and I look forward to working with him to make our nation’s rail sys-
tem the safest and most efficient in the world.

Senator  INOUYE.  We  were  all  pleased  to  see  Senator  Dole  on 

Meet the Press. And I know that his book will be a best seller. 

Senator DOLE. Thank you. 
Senator INOUYE. Senator Dole. 

STATEMENT OF HON. ELIZABETH DOLE,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA 

Senator DOLE. Thank you very much. 
Senator  Inouye,  distinguished  Committee  Members,  it  gives  me 
great  pleasure  and  it  is  indeed  an  honor  to  support  this  morning

ports Authority Board. Bill has demonstrated a long and dedicated 
commitment to public service over the years for our Home State of 
North  Carolina  and  our  nation.  Without  a  doubt,  one  of  the  most 
rewarding  and  challenging  projects  I  chose  to  undertake  while 
serving as Secretary of Transportation was the task of moving Na-
tional and Dulles International Airports out of the Federal Govern-
ment. 

National was a rather shabby, small gateway to the nation’s cap-
ital.  And  following  airline  deregulation,  Dulles  was  desperately  in 
need  of  vast  expansion.  I  will  never  forget  the  night  in  1984  when 
my husband and I were having a little pillow talk, Senator Inouye. 
And  I  told  him  of  my  conviction  that  it  was  time  for  Uncle  Sam 
to ‘‘free the airports.’’ Bob’s reaction? He said, ‘‘Forget it, Elizabeth. 
It  has  been  tried  eight  times  since  1949,  and  it  never  got  out  of 
committee.’’  And  he  rolled  over  and  went  to  sleep.  As  far  as  I  was 
concerned, the gauntlet had been thrown down. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  DOLE.  I  later  found  that  Bob  was  absolutely  correct  in 
predicting  the  journey  to  regional  control  would  be  a  very  tough 
one  indeed.  But  after  3  years  of  dedicated  effort  from  a  very  tal-
ented  team  and  the  help  of  you,  Senator  Inouye,  and  other  Com-
mittee Members, it passed both houses of Congress and was signed 
into law by President Reagan. 

In  1987,  independent  operation  of  Washington’s  two  airports  be-
came a successful partnership. Our plan was working. The airports 
were  able  to  raise  the  necessary  funds  through  sales  of  tax-free 
bonds  to  provide  for  the  capital  improvements  and  expansions. 
Today,  Washington’s  two  airports  serve  39  million  passengers  an-
nually with 1,069 daily flights to over 100 destinations throughout 
the United States and 36 countries worldwide. 

It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Washington  Airports  Authority 
Board  to  oversee  the  airports  and  their  security,  safety,  develop-
ment  and  maintenance.  I  commend  the  board  for  their  excellence 
in handling the more than 100,000 passengers who use the two air-
ports on a daily basis. And I thank Senator Stevens for all his help 
in  creating  this  board.  He  signed  the  cloture  petition  for  the  ena-
bling legislation. And he ‘‘Hulk’ed’’ the provision through on an om-
nibus  bill.  Without  his  leadership,  we  would  not  be  having  this 
hearing today. 

And  Senator  Inouye,  I  thank  you  for  your  hard  work  in  making 
that  bill  a  bipartisan  effort,  which  has  indeed  made  air  travel  to 
and from our nation’s capital far easier and less expensive. 

I know that Bill Cobey will be a wonderful asset, will do a great 
job as an addition to the Airports Authority Board. Bill has served 
his  state  and  nation  in  many  different  capacities,  and  he  has  an 
outstanding list of accomplishments. 

He received his undergraduate education from Emory University 
in Atlanta and then earned an MBA from the prestigious Wharton 
School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and an M.Ed. 
in health and physical education from the University of Pittsburgh. 
Prior  to  representing  North  Carolina  in  the  U.S.  Congress,  Bill 
served  as  Governor  Jim  Martin’s  Deputy  Secretary  of  Transpor-
tation  and  later  as  Secretary  of  North  Carolina’s  Department  of 
Environment, Health, and Natural Resources.

A  devoted  husband,  father  and  grandfather,  Bill  is  a  man  I  am 
proud  to  call  my  friend,  a  man  of  tremendous  character,  a  man 
committed  to  making  our  country  better.  I  am  confident  that  the 
board and the country will benefit from his service. 

I  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  express  my  admiration  and 
respect  for  Bill  Cobey,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  to  present  him  to  the 
Committee. Thank you. 

Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much, Senator Dole. 
And now I would like to welcome Senator Burr. 
Senator Burr. 

STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BURR,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA 

Senator BURR. Thank you, Chairman Inouye and Members of the 
Committee.  I  am  proud  to  be  here  today  representing  North  Caro-
lina,  the  home  of  this  year’s  collegiate  basketball  champions  and, 
as of last night, Miss USA. 

It is my pleasure today to introduce Bill Cobey of Durham, North 
Carolina.  And  I  am  here  today  to  fully  endorse  his  nomination  to 
the  board  of  the  Metropolitan  Washington  Airport  Authority.  It 
should  be  noted  that  Bill  was  elected  to  the  House  of  Representa-
tives  in  1984  and  served  with  Senators  McCain,  Lott,  Snowe,  Dor-
gan,  and  Senator  Boxer,  all  current  Members  of  the  Commerce 
Committee, as Members of the House in the 98th Congress. 

While  Bill’s  well-documented  service  to  our  state  and  country  as 
a Congressman, cabinet secretary in Raleigh, and public university 
advocate  qualify  him  for  a  position  on  the  Authority’s  board,  I  be-
lieve it will be his background as an athletic director at one of the 
nation’s  most  successful  universities  that  will  best  serve  the  mis-
sion of the board. Athletic directors are known for their tenacity in 
raising  money  and  support  for  capital  improvement  projects.  And 
his  success  at  the  University  of  North  Carolina  and  the  success  of 
the  school’s  athletic  program  and  what  it  enjoys  today  are  the  di-
rect  result  of  capital  campaigns  undertaken  by  the  school  during 
his tenure as athletic director. 

His  wealth  of  knowledge  in  these  endeavors  and  deep  reserve  of 
people skills will position the Authority well as it prepares current 
and future capital improvements at Reagan and Dulles Airports. 

Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the Committee favorably report-
ing on Bill’s nomination. And I will be honored to cast my vote for 
him when the nomination is considered by the full Senate. 

Thank you.

at  one  of  the  nation’s  most  successful  university’s  that  will  best  serve  the  mission 
of the board. 

Athletic  directors  are  known  for  their  tenacity  in  raising  money  and  support  for 
capital improvement projects, and his success at the University and the success the 
school’s athletic program enjoys today are the direct result of capital campaigns un-
dertaken  by  the  school  during  his  tenure  as  athletic  director.  His  wealth  of  knowl-
edge in these endeavors and deep reservoir of people skills will position the Author-
ity well as it prepares current and future capital improvements at Reagan and Dul-
les airports. 

I  look  forward  to  the  Committee  favorably  reporting  out  Bill’s  nomination  and  I 
will  be  honored  to  cast  my  vote  for  him  when  the  nomination  is  considered  by  the 
whole Senate.

Senator INOUYE. I thank you very much, Senator Burr. 
And thank you, Senator Dole. 
And  now  it  is  my  pleasure  to  call  upon  the  first  panel,  Dr.  Mi-
chael Griffin, nominated to be Administrator of the National Aero-
nautics  and  Space  Administration,  and  Mr.  Joseph  Boardman, 
nominated to be Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administra-
tion. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Mr.  Chairman,  could  I  make  an  opening 
statement  as  the  witnesses  are  coming  forward?  Could  I  make  my 
opening statement? 

Senator INOUYE. Go ahead. 

STATEMENT OF HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON,

U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS 

Senator HUTCHISON. As Chairman of the NASA and Science Sub-
committee,  I  just  want  to  say  how  pleased  I  am  with  the  nomina-
tion  of  Dr.  Michael  Griffin,  because  I  think  having  his  leadership, 
his expertise, his knowledge at this time when we are trying to get 
the  return  to  flight  and  set  NASA  on  its  mission  for  the  next  50 
years,  I  think  having  a  leader  such  as  Michael  Griffin  will  enable 
us to get a clear focus of where we want NASA to go. And so I am 
very supportive of his nomination. 

We  are  going  to  have  several  hearings  in  our  Committee  to  talk 
about  the  importance  of  the  Shuttle,  and  the  Space  Station.  And 
I  will  have  questions  later  for  Dr.  Griffin  regarding  some  of  those 
issues. But I do want to ask the Chairman and the Ranking Mem-
ber  to  consider  trying  to  get  Dr.  Griffin’s  nomination  out  of  the 
Senate this week. We know that return to flight is on a time sched-
ule.  And  having  the,  not  permanent  leader  of  NASA,  but  certainly 
the designated leader of NASA on board by Monday would help ac-
complish the return to flight on that timetable. 

So Mr. Chairman, I hope that we can expedite his votes from the 
Committee  and  further  have  this  on  the  Senate  floor  before  we 
leave this week. That would be my request. 

Senator  NELSON.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  support  Senator 
Hutchison’s comment. NASA needs a leader, as we are coming back 
to flight. And if you can honor Senator Hutchison’s request to expe-
dite  this  nomination  to  the  floor  so  that  he  could  be  in  place  the 
beginning of next week, I think it would serve the Nation well.

Dr.  Griffin,  first  let  me  say,  I  apologize.  I  was  appearing  before 
the  Intelligence  Committee  to  introduce  my  great  friend,  Ambas-
sador  Negroponte,  to  that  committee  for  the  confirmation  to  his 
new  post  as  Director  of  National  Intelligence.  I  want  to  put  in  the 
record  without  objection  the  statement  I  would  have  made  had  I 
been here to open the hearing. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Stevens follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The Committee will come to order. 
Today  the  Committee  will  hear  from  four  of  the  President’s  nominees  and  the 
Senators  who  will  introduce  them.  On  the  first  panel  will  be  Dr.  Griffin  and  Mr. 
Boardman. 

Dr. Michael Griffin was nominated on March 14, 2005 to be NASA Administrator. 

Senator Mikulski will introduce him. 

Joseph  Boardman  was  nominated  on  March  17,  2005  to  Head  the  Federal  Rail-

road Administration. Senator Schumer will introduce Mr. Boardman. 

The  second  panel  will  have  Nancy  Nord,  who  was  nominated  on  February  28, 
2005  to  be  a  Commissioner  of  the  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission.  Ms.  Nord 
is  a  South  Dakota  native,  and  I  understand  Senators  Thune  and  Johnson  support 
her nomination. 

Former Representative Bill Cobey was nominated to the Metropolitan Washington 
Airports  Authority  on  February  28,  2005.  Senators  Dole  and  Burr  will  introduce 
him. 

I  do  not  have  a  lengthy  statement,  but  will  just  say  that  these  nominees,  if  con-

firmed, will join important agencies. 

NASA is in the process of returning the Space Shuttle to flight after the Columbia 
accident  and  re-organizing  itself  to  pursue  the  President’s  vision  for  space  explo-
ration. 

The  authorization  for  the  Federal  Railroad  Administration  has  expired,  and  the 
next FRA Administrator will have to work closely with this Committee to re-author-
ize that agency. 

The authorization for the Consumer Product Safety Commission has also expired, 
and  the  Commission’s  authority  to  operate  with  a  two  member  quorum  expires  at 
the end of this month. 

Finally,  the  Metropolitan  Washington  Airports  Authority  will  play  an  important 

role in the future of general aviation access in the Washington area. 

Before  I  recognize  my  Co-chairman,  let  me  ask  the  Committee  to  submit  post-
hearing questions as quickly as possible. All nominees are anxious to move forward. 
NASA  in  particular  needs  a  new  administrator  as  the  Space  Shuttle  returns  to 
flight next month.

The CHAIRMAN. Dr. Griffin, would you please introduce your fam-

ily? I believe there are some of them here. Are there? 

Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes, sir, there are. My wife Rebecca; my brother-in-
law,  Ray  Hand;  and  one  of  my  daughters,  Allison  Griffin  are  here 
with me today. I am very pleased. 

As  much  as  I  dislike  to  correct  any  statement  made  by  Senator 
Mikulski, I would have to say that Rebecca is actually the one who 
lights the fire, rather than bringing the rocket. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator HUTCHISON. It looks like you are going to have to expand 

on that comment. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. Boardman. 

The CHAIRMAN. Michael, I will be glad to hand her the torch. 
[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Boardman, would you introduce your family, 

Mr.  BOARDMAN.  Yes,  Senator.  My  wife  is  with  me,  Joanne 

please? 

Boardman.

Mr. BOARDMAN. And my kids are all watching. 
The CHAIRMAN. Good. 
Well,  we  are  delighted  to  have  these  two  nominees.  First,  Dr. 
Griffin,  nominated  to  be  Administrator  for  the  National  Aero-
nautics and Space Administration, we would be pleased to hear any 
statement you wish to make. 
STATEMENT  OF  DR.  MICHAEL  D.  GRIFFIN,  NOMINEE  TO  BE
ADMINISTRATOR,  NATIONAL  AERONAUTICS  AND  SPACE
ADMINISTRATION 
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Sir,  I  would  like  to  enter  my  formal  written  state-
ment for the record, if there are no objections at this time, and will 
just take a couple minutes for comments, if that would be OK. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  We  are  happy  to  put  all  the  nominees’  state-

ments in the record, as if read, and have your comments. 

Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much for the oppor-
tunity  to  appear  at  this  hearing.  Also,  I  would  like  to  convey  my 
thanks  to  Senator  Sarbanes  and  Senator  Mikulski  for  those  intro-
ductions,  which  were  certainly  somewhat  over  the  top  for  a  simple 
aerospace engineer from a small town. So I am very grateful for the 
sentiments I have heard also from Senators Hutchison and Nelson. 
They are very gratifying. 

We  are  here  today  at  a  time  which  is  a  watershed  moment  for 
the  space  program.  The  timing  was  brought  to  us  in  the  saddest 
possible  way  by  the  loss  of  Columbia  in  February  of  2003  and  our 
efforts  since  then  to  regroup  from  that  loss  and  to  move  on.  The 
timing is forced upon us. But it does produce a watershed moment, 
and that watershed has been crossed. 

In the wake of the failure investigation from Columbia, it has be-
come  clear  that  the  United  States  needs  to  look  in  new  directions 
and  to  look  beyond  where  we  have  been  with  our  program  in  the 
last several decades. In the words of the Columbia Accident Inves-
tigation  Board,  the  United  States  is  not  going  to  abandon  human 
space flight. But for the foreseeable future, it will be expensive, dif-
ficult, and dangerous. The goals that we seek out should be worthy 
of the cost and the risk. 

I  think  it  is  now  understood  that  a  human  space  flight  program 
focused  only  on  the  completion  of  the  International  Space  Station 
and  the  servicing  of  that  Station  with  the  Shuttle  does  not  qualify 
as  a  goal  which  is  worthy  of  the  expense,  the  risk,  and  difficulty 
of human space flight. 

Now  President  Bush  has  seen  beyond  that  and  has  proposed  a 
new program. It is the right strategic program. It is the right stra-
tegic direction for the United States civil space program and I sup-
port  it  wholeheartedly.  I  have  no  doubt  that  the  Members  of  this 
Committee  have  had  access  to  some  of  my  written  record  on  this 
point  and  know  that  this  topic  is  the  one  closest  to  my  heart  with 
regard to the direction of the program. 

There  are  many  who  say  that  the  proposals  President  Bush  has 
made cannot be afforded. I did a little homework and I would point 
out  something  which  may  not  be  generally  realized.  We  look  back 
at  the  Apollo  years  as  a  time  when  NASA,  received  essentially  all 
the  money  that  it  needed,  all  the  money  that  it  wanted  even.  I  do 
not  believe  that  that  was  actually  the  case,  having  looked  at  the 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  09:55 Nov 17, 2005 Jkt 023363 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\23363.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

12

record. But that is the mythology of the time, was that NASA was 
in a funding-unlimited period for the Apollo program. 

Well,  the  Apollo  years,  viewed  more  broadly,  spanned  the  period 
from 1959 through 1974, at which time we had finished the Apollo-
Skylab  missions.  So  it  is  the  early  part  of  the  Agency,  its  first  16 
years, if you will. If you compare the funding received, the funding 
which  was  made  available  on  behalf  of  the  citizens  to  the  Space 
Agency in that first 16 years, it is within a couple of percent of the 
funding  which  has  been  made  available  to  the  Agency  in  the  last 
16  years  of  its  existence.  You  can  mess  around  with  that  number 
a  little  bit,  depending  on  which  inflation  adjustment  you  care  to 
use, but it is not more than a couple of percent difference, no mat-
ter how you calculate it. 

So NASA has been well funded by the Nation in the last 16 years 
of its existence, as well funded as it was in the first. If we continue 
to  receive  the  President’s  budget  allocations,  we  can  do  the  pro-
gram that the President has proposed. We know that we can do it, 
because we have done it. 

The  Apollo  years  are  often  looked  at  as  the  period  when  the 
agency  had  a  single  mission  focus.  That,  too,  is  mythology.  That, 
too,  is  incorrect.  During  the  Apollo  years,  in  addition  to  executing 
that program, which will forever remain as one of mankind’s great-
est achievements, we also executed a host of planetary missions in 
the Mariner, Ranger, Surveyor, Voyager, and Viking series. We ex-
ecuted  earth  science  missions  beginning  with  TIROS  and  Nimbus 
and moving on to ESSA and other weather and earth resources sat-
ellite programs. 

We executed astronomy missions, such as the Orbiting Solar Ob-
servatory.  We  executed  a  robust,  bold  aeronautics  program,  which 
featured 199 flights of the X–15 with only one fatality. We did fun-
damental  work  in  the  development  of  airline  transport  propulsion 
and air safety management. We did the fundamental aerodynamics 
work  that  led  to  the  ability  to  design  and  build  the  Space  Shuttle. 
All  the  lifting  body  research  done  at  Edwards  Air  Force  Base  to 
precede  the  development  of  the  Shuttle  was  accomplished  during 
the late sixties and early seventies. 

So  NASA  has  proved  in  its  past  that  we  can  do  more  than  one 
thing with the funding that you and your colleagues have provided 
to  us,  and  I  look  forward  to  the  opportunity  to  prove  to  you  that 
we can do that again. 

Thank  you  very  much  and  I  stand  ready  to  take  any  of  your 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Doctor.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. MICHAEL D. GRIFFIN, NOMINEE TO BE ADMINISTRATOR, 

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senators. I am honored to appear before you today 
as  President  Bush’s  nominee  to  be  the  next  NASA  Administrator.  As  you  know,  I 
have  spent  a  long  career  in  the  aerospace  business,  and  I  believe  that  I  will  need 
all of that experience, and more, behind me if confirmed in this position. I look for-
ward to the challenge.

The  aftermath  of  the  tragic  loss  of  the  Space  Shuttle  Columbia  on  February  1, 
2003  brought  us  to  a  watershed  moment  in  the  American  civil  space  program. 
Choices had to be made. The President has put forth a choice, a strategic vision for 
the  Space  Program.  That  vision  has  been  enunciated  with  exceptional  clarity,  and 
has  been  subjected  to  considerable  public  debate  for  over  a  year.  I  think  it  may  be 
said  that,  while  differences  of  opinion  exist,  the  President’s  proposal  has  attained 
broad  strategic  acceptance.  It  is  now  understood  that  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion,  supported  by  the  Space  Shuttle,  cannot  be  the  centerpiece  of  the  Nation’s 
Human  Spaceflight  Program.  The  strategic  vision  for  the  U.S.  manned  space  pro-
gram is of exploration beyond low Earth orbit. 

It  is  a  daring  move  at  any  time  for  a  national  leader  to  call  for  the  bold  explo-
ration  of  unknown  worlds,  a  major  effort  at  the  very  limit  of  the  technical  state  of 
the art. And it was the same way back in 1492, when Queen Isabella overrode King 
Ferdinand’s  reluctance  and  backed  Columbus’  voyage  to  ‘‘the  New  World,’’  the  first 
step  in  the  creation  of  Spain’s  colonial  empire.  But  few  recall  that  1492  was  a  key 
year  in  the  history  of  Western  civilization,  entirely  apart  from  the  European  ‘‘dis-
covery’’  of  the  New  World.  The  big  news  that  year  was  the  re-conquest  of  Granada 
after a ten-year siege by Spanish forces, an event which essentially marked the con-
clusion  of  an  eight-century  struggle  against  the  Moorish  occupation  of  Spain.  With 
the  Spanish  treasury  depleted,  many—including  King  Ferdinand—believed  that  it 
was not the time for the nation to be embarking on what was, in that era, an effort 
right at the edge of what was technologically possible. 

But  whether  or  not  the  story  of  Queen  Isabella  pledging  her  jewels  to  back  the 
voyage  is  true,  it  is  a  matter  of  record  that  Isabella,  Queen  of  Aragon  in  her  own 
right,  understood  that  several  other  nations  were  capable  of  sponsoring  Columbus, 
and  likely  would  if  Spain  did  not.  England,  France,  and  Italy  had  arisen  as  Euro-
pean  powers  while  Spain  had  struggled  against  the  Moors,  and  Spain’s  tiny  neigh-
bor,  Portugal,  had  prospered  through  the  growth  of  her  maritime  prowess  under 
Prince Henry the Navigator. The ‘‘discovery’’ of the New World had happened before 
and  would  have  happened  again,  whether  or  not  Columbus  had  ever  sailed  from 
Palos.  One  way  or  another,  European  settlement  of  the  New  World  was  inevitable; 
however, it was Isabella’s bold action that secured Spain’s role in that future. If Co-
lumbus  failed,  she  would  be  discredited,  but  if  he  succeeded,  Spain  would  succeed, 
and  would  become  preeminent  among  the  nations  of  her  time—and  that  was  the 
way it happened. 

And that is the way it is today. In the twenty-first century and beyond, for Amer-
ica  to  continue  to  be  preeminent  among  nations,  it  is  necessary  for  us  also  to  be 
the  preeminent  spacefaring  nation.  Or  are  we  willing  to  accept  the  world  of  a  gen-
eration or two hence where other nations will be engaged in the development of the 
Solar  System,  and  we  are  not?  If  not,  then  it  is  time  to  recognize  that  we  have 
squandered  a  once-insurmountable  lead  in  the  arts  and  sciences  of  spaceflight.  The 
best  we  can  say  for  ourselves  today  is  that  our  grounded  Space  Shuttle  is  much 
more sophisticated than the operational vehicles belonging to the two nations which 
have sent people into space since we have last done so. 

None  of  this  is  to  say  that  the  United  States  should  necessarily  plan  to  ‘‘go  it 
alone’’  in  space  exploration.  Great  nations  must  be  prepared  to  do  so  when  nec-
essary,  but  it  is  equally  true  that  great  nations  need  allies  and  partners.  There  is 
room for these relationships in the President’s Vision for Space Exploration, and cer-
tainly  we  have  benefited  from  the  Russian  capability  to  support  the  International 
Space  Station  during  the  two  years  in  which  the  Shuttle  has  been  grounded.  But 
in  the  future,  the  United  States  should  avoid  dependence  upon  other  nations  for 
critical spacefaring systems. 

Many who share the President’s strategic vision for space exploration are nonethe-
less  lukewarm  in  their  support,  believing  it  to  be  unaffordable  or  unsustainable.

This  concern  is  understandable.  Former  Undersecretary  of  Defense  for  Acquisition, 
Technology, and Logistics, and Chair of the President’s Commission on Implementa-
tion  of  United  States  Space  Exploration  Policy,  Pete  Aldridge,  has  pointed  out  that 
to be effective, the commitment to space exploration needs to be sustained over mul-
tiple Presidential Administrations and sessions of Congress. 

The strategic vision for space must therefore be broadly inclusive, to enable a con-
sistent  and  appropriate  level  of  financial  support  without  disruptive  funding  peaks 
and valleys. The decision to have a robust space program is like the decision to have 
a  capable  military  force—it  cannot  be  made  in  one  year  and  un-made  in  the  next. 
The  nation  does  not  debate,  each  year,  whether  or  not  it  will  have  such  forces.  A 
similarly  sustained  bipartisan  commitment  to  American  leadership  in  space  is  re-
quired. 

And,  at  least  since  the  aftermath  of  the  Challenger  accident,  19  years  ago,  we 
have had exactly that commitment. In constant dollars, NASA has received approxi-
mately the same allocation of funding from the taxpayers in the last sixteen years—
the  Space  Station  Era—as  it  received  in  its  first  16  years—the  Apollo  Era.  If  we 
are  less  attracted  to  the  results  of  the  Station  Era  than  of  the  Apollo  Era,  then  we 
need to reconsider our goals and our manner of pursuing them. But if funding levels 
continue in accordance with the President’s plans, resources are sufficient to enable 
a U.S. return to the Moon, and, later, to go to Mars. The country has already dem-
onstrated  the  consistent  support  that  NASA  must  have  over  an  extended  period  of 
time  to  execute  a  program  of  human  exploration.  We  simply  have  been  doing  other 
things with that money. 

The  arts  and  sciences  of  spaceflight  are  not  restricted  to  human  spaceflight. 
Robotic spacecraft such as those of Spirit and Opportunity have taken us, by proxy, 
to  the  surface  of  Mars.  Galileo,  Cassini  and  Voyager  have  taken  us  to  Jupiter,  Sat-
urn,  and  the  outer  reaches  of  the  Solar  System.  New  Horizons  will  shortly  set  sail 
for Pluto, the last remaining planet (so far as we know) not yet visited by any space-
craft  from  Earth.  And,  of  course,  the  Great  Observatories,  including  the  Hubble 
Space  Telescope,  Chandra,  Spitzer,  and  Compton,  have  allowed  us  to  extend  our 
gaze to the very edge of the Universe, and back in time almost to its beginning. The 
images and the knowledge returned to us by these, our surrogates, have shaped our 
culture,  our  view  of  the  Universe,  and  our  place  in  it  almost  as  powerfully  as  if 
human  explorers  had  been  present.  As  we  undertake  to  redirect  our  Human 
Spaceflight  Program,  it  is  crucial  that  we  do  it  without  damaging  NASA’s  out-
standing science programs, which have been among the crown jewels of the nation’s 
achievements. 

Those who claim that NASA cannot afford robust programs in both robotic science 
and manned spaceflight are mistaken. NASA in the Apollo Era was hardly the ‘‘sin-
gle  mission  agency’’  in  the  simplified  view  that  is  often  heard  today.  In  addition  to 
the  manned  spaceflight  development  programs  of  the  time,  NASA  executed  dozens 
of  Explorer-class  missions,  a  dozen  Pioneer  missions  (including  Pioneer  10  and  11 
to Jupiter and Saturn), Ranger 1–9, Surveyor 1–7, Mariner 1–10, the Orbiting Solar 
Observatory,  Orbiting  Geophysical  Observatory,  and  Orbiting  Astronomical  Observ-
atory series, and paid for most of the Viking missions to Mars, which were launched 
in 1975. Communications satellite development was initiated with Telstar and Early 
Bird,  while  the  TIROS,  NIMBUS,  and  ESSA  series  did  the  same  for  weather  sat-
ellites.  In  addition  to  these  robotic  science  and  technology  development  missions, 
NASA  also  executed  199  X–15  flights  (which  still  hold  the  speed  record  for  piloted 
flight  within  the  atmosphere),  and  accomplished  an  otherwise  vigorous  program  of 
aeronautics  development,  including  the  liftingbody  research  which  enabled  the  de-
velopment  of  the  Space  Shuttle.  This  hardly  seems  the  record  of  a  ‘‘single  mission 
agency.’’

My  conclusion  is  that  we  as  a  nation  can  clearly  afford  well-executed,  vigorous 
programs  in  both  robotic  and  human  space  exploration  as  well  as  in  aeronautics. 
We know this. We did it. NASA can do more than one thing at a time. 

The  Nation  is  not  going  to  abandon  space  exploration,  human  or  robotic.  Given 
this, the proper debate in a world of limited resources is over which goals to pursue. 
I  believe  that,  if  money  is  to  be  spent  on  space,  there  is  little  doubt  that  the  huge 
majority of Americans would prefer to spend it on an exciting, outward-focused, des-
tination-oriented program. And that is what the President’s Vision for Space Explo-
ration is about. 

With  that,  I  thank  you,  and  stand  ready  to  answer  any  questions  you  may  have.

6.  Explain  how  you  will  resolve  any  potential  conflict  of  interest,  including  any 

that may be disclosed by your responses to the above items. 

If  confirmed  as  NASA  Administrator,  I  will  resign  my  position  as  Space  Depart-
ment  Head  at  the  Applied  Physics  Laboratory  (APL),  a  University  Affiliated  Re-
search  Center  operated  by  Johns  Hopkins  University  (Hopkins).  Furthermore,  pur-
suant  to  5  CFR  § 2635.502,  for  one  year  after  I  terminate  that  position,  I  will  not 
participate  in  any  particular  matter  involving  specific  parties  in  which  Hopkins  is 
a party or represents a party, unless I am authorized to participate. 

If  confirmed,  I  will  also  resign  my  position  on  the  board  of  directors  of,  and  will 
not  serve  as  President  of,  the  American  Institute  of  Aeronautics  and  Astronautics 
(AIAA). Pursuant to 5 CFR § 2635.502, for a period of one year after the termination

parties  in  which  AIAA  is  a  party  or  represents  a  party,  unless  I  am  authorized  to 
participate. 

In  addition,  AIAA  is  the  publisher  of  a  textbook,  Space  Vehicle  Design,  which  I 
co-authored and which is in its second edition. I continue to receive royalties for this 
work. For so long as this arrangement is in effect, I will have a covered relationship 
with  AIAA  under  5  CFR  § 2635.502.  Therefore,  I  will  not  participate  in  any  par-
ticular  matter  involving  specific  parties  in  which  AIAA  is  a  party  or  represents  a 
party,  unless  I  am  authorized  to  participate.  I  will  not  write  any  future  revisions 
to this textbook while serving as Administrator. 

Finally,  as  required  by  18  U.S.C.  § 208(a),  I  will  not  participate  personally  and 
substantially  in  any  particular  matter  that  has  a  direct  and  predictable  effect  on 
my  financial  interests  or  those  of  any  other  person  whose  interests  are  imputed  to 
me,  unless  I  first  obtain  a  written  waiver,  pursuant  to  section  208(b)(1),  or  qualify 
for a regulatory exemption, pursuant to section 208(b)(2). I understand that the fol-
lowing  securities  holdings  present  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  under  section 
208(a), although it has been determined that it is not necessary at this time for me 
to divest these interests: DuPont, Electro Energy, General Electric, Eastman Kodak, 
Exxon Mobil, Honeywell, Nanosys, and Verizon. 

C. LEGAL MATTERS

volved as a party in an administrative agency proceeding or civil litigation? No.

5.  Please  advise  the  Committee  of  any  additional  information,  favorable  or  unfa-
vorable,  which  you  feel  should  be  disclosed  in  connection  with  your  nomination:

D. RELATIONSHIP WITH COMMITTEE 

1. Will you ensure that your department/agency complies with deadlines for infor-

mation set by congressional committees? Yes. 

2.  Will  you  ensure  that  your  department/agency  does  whatever  it  can  to  protect 
congressional  witnesses  and  whistle  blowers  from  reprisal  for  their  testimony  and 
disclosures? Yes. 

3.  Will  you  cooperate  in  providing  the  Committee  with  requested  witnesses,  in-
cluding technical experts and career employees, with firsthand knowledge of matters 
of interest to the Committee? Yes. 

4.  Are  you  willing  to  appear  and  testify  before  any  duly  constituted  committee  of 
the  Congress  on  such  occasions  as  you  may  be  reasonably  requested  to  do  so?  Yes.

The CHAIRMAN. Your predecessor served my assistant at the De-
fense Appropriations Subcommittee. In the past year, as Chairman 
of the Appropriations Committee, I have traveled around the NASA 
area considerably. When we heard that he was going to step down, 
I have to say that everywhere I went, people told me I should look 
you up and make certain that you were interested and would take 
the  position,  if  we  could  convince  the  President  to  appoint  you.  So 
we welcome your appointment. 

I  will  say  to  the  Members  of  the  Committee,  we  just  checked 
with the floor, and if the members will agree and meet with us off 
the  floor  after  the  first  vote,  we  will  take  the  emergency  action  of 
reporting Dr. Griffin’s nomination right away, because of the time-
frame  that  we  have  heard  exists  for  getting  Dr.  Griffin  confirmed 
in order to proceed with the difficult job that he has. 

May I ask, Mr. Boardman, if you would make your opening state-
ment? Then we will ask questions, let each member ask questions, 
of each one of you as we go through the Committee. 

STATEMENT OF JOSEPH H. BOARDMAN, NOMINEE TO BE
ADMINISTRATOR, FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION 
Mr.  BOARDMAN.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Stevens  and  Ranking 
Member Inouye, for the opportunity to speak with you this morning 
in the Committee. I would also like to thank Senator Schumer from 
my home state for a very gracious introduction. 

I  am  honored  to  be  nominated  to  be  nominated  for  this  position 
by  President  Bush  and  if  confirmed  as  Federal  Railroad  Adminis-
trator,  I  look  forward  to  adding  value  to  Secretary  Mineta’s  team 
at the U.S. DOT. 

I am pleased that I have Joanne with me. And I am not the rock-
et  scientist  up  here,  Michael,  but  it  is  the  support  of  my  wife  and 
family that are watching that makes my life worthwhile. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  You  can  check  her  out  as  an  engineer  on 

the railroad. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr.  BOARDMAN.  If  confirmed  as  the  Federal  Railroad  Adminis-
trator, I would like to work with this Committee, other Senate com-
mittees,  House  committees,  and  those  interested  in  railroad  trans-
portation,  to  further  the  security,  safety,  reliability,  environmental

improvements, and economic competitiveness of the railroad indus-
try and of this nation. 

If  confirmed,  there  are  three  areas  that  I  would  like  to  work  on 
specifically and begin to concentrate on. The first one is safety. And 
while we are not doing rockets, a railroad system is a very complex 
operation,  whether  it  is  freight  or  whether  it  is  a  passenger  oper-
ation. You cannot be complacent about safety. 

Constant  attention  to  detail  is  necessary  and  is  required  both  in 
the technical and in the operational sense of the railroad. And I be-
lieve that we also have to pay attention to the ergonomics and the 
human  factors  in  railroad  transportation  in  order  to  ensure  a  safe 
operation. And I will be paying attention to that. 

Second  is  intercity  passenger  service,  Amtrak,  commuter  lines, 
corridor services. Congress and the Administration need to work to-
gether on those existing services to make improvements, to restruc-
ture, to reform, to maintain intercity passenger rail across this na-
tion today. By working together, we will demonstrate our desire to 
have  a  workable  and  publicly  valued  passenger  transportation 
service for our nation. 

I  do  not  believe  that  a  current  one-size-fits-all  model  works  for 
our  nation  in  intercity  passenger  rail.  And  if  confirmed,  I  will 
spend  my  time  and  my  energy  working  to  bring  about  a  new  era 
for America’s intercity passenger rail service. 

And finally, I will concentrate on the human factors and staff de-
velopment  at  DOT,  and  the  FRA.  If  we  are  going  to  reform  pas-
senger rail and develop a safety strategy that will meet and exceed 
—and I think we need to exceed—the public’s expectations on safe-
ty, then I will need to concentrate on building an organization that 
will both support and be supported to accomplish those changes. 

Thank you again for the opportunity to be here. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
[The  prepared  statement  and  biographical  information  of  Mr. 

Boardman follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOSEPH BOARDMAN, NOMINEE TO BE ADMINISTRATOR, 

FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION 

Thank you, Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member Inouye, for giving me the op-
portunity to visit with the Committee. I would also like to thank Senator Schumer, 
from my home State of New York, for that gracious introduction. 

I  am  very  honored  to  have  been  nominated  for  this  position  by  President  Bush. 
If  confirmed  as  Federal  Railroad  Administrator,  I  look  forward  to  adding  value  to 
Secretary Mineta’s team at the U.S. Department of Transportation. 

I  am  also  pleased  to  introduce  Joanne  Boardman  to  you,  as  my  wife  and  partner 
for  over  30  years.  I  know  that  my  children  Joe,  Kathryn,  Emily  and  Philip  are 
watching this if they can find a location to do so, along with my other family mem-
bers and friends. It is through their encouragement and support that I am here. 

If  confirmed  as  Federal  Railroad  Administrator,  I  plan  to  work  closely  with  this 
and other Senate and House committees to improve railroad safety and security, re-
liability, environmental impacts, and economic competitiveness. 

There are three initial issues that deserve my attention from the start. 
First and foremost, safety. I believe that we, as a society and as an industry, can 
never  be  complacent  about  safety.  Railroads  are  among  the  most  complex  enter-
prises operated in the world today. Constant attention to detail is required, both in 
the  technical  and  operational  sense.  I  believe  in  understanding  human  factors  and 
the  environment  within  which  they  work,  and  making  subsequent  improvements, 
based on that understanding, that lead to safer performance. 

Second,  intercity  passenger  rail.  Congress  and  the  Administration  must  work  to-
gether  to  reform  the  existing,  failing  system.  By  doing  so,  we  will  demonstrate  our 
desire to have a workable and a publicly-valued passenger rail service in our nation.

I  do  not  believe  that  the  current  one-size-fits-all  model  works.  If  confirmed  I  will 
work tirelessly to bring about a new era for America’s intercity passenger rail. 

Finally,  FRA  staff  development.  If  we  are  looking  to  reform  passenger  rail  and 
working to develop a safety strategy that will meet and exceed the public’s expecta-
tions, then I will need to concentrate on building an organization that will both sup-
port and be supported to accomplish those changes. 

Thank You. Again, I appreciate the opportunity to be here and I am happy to an-

swer any questions you may have of me.

Senator  INOUYE.  If  I  may,  I  would  like  to  yield  to  Senator  Lau-

tenberg because of the special hearing. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Lautenberg is recognized. 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. And I ask, first of 
all, unanimous consent that my full statement would be put in the 
record. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Without  objection,  and  Senator  Schumer’s  state-

ment introducing Mr. Boardman will appear, too. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Lautenberg follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Mr. Chairman: 
Good morning and thank you for holding this hearing on the nominees to fill these 

important positions. 

NASA  is  an  agency  that  faces  many  challenges,  ranging  from  documented  prob-
lems  with  financial  management  to  accusations  of  waste  and  abuse.  And  these  are 
credible charges made at the former head of the agency. Despite these concerns, the 
President’s  2006  budget  proposal  would  increase  funding  for  NASA  while  cutting 
many other agencies. 

On  the  other  hand  we  have  Amtrak.  Under  new  management,  Amtrak  has  over-
hauled  its  financial  accounting  system  and  trimmed  its  workforce  by  20  percent—
while adding 20 percent more trains and reaching record ridership nationwide. 

Yet the President proposes to bankrupt our passenger rail system. Killing Amtrak 
would strand the 25 million passengers who chose inter-city rail service last year—
the equivalent of 125 thousand fully-booked 757 airplanes. 

Of  course,  Amtrak  not  only  provides  inter-city  rail  service.  It  also  provides  infra-
structure and operational assistance to commuter rail lines that carry 850 thousand 
American  workers  every  weekday.  If  we  kill  Amtrak,  we  will  cut  off  these  workers 
from their jobs—or force them onto already crowded roads, bridges and tunnels. 

Americans  need  Amtrak  every  day.  But  we  needed  it  most  when  our  nation  was 
attacked  on  September  11,  2001.  When  our  commercial  aviation  system  was  shut 
down  on  9/11,  stranded  passengers  turned  to  Amtrak  to  reunite  them  with  their

families.  Thank  goodness  they  had  that  choice.  That  tragic  day  reminded  us  that 
our nation cannot depend entirely on one mode of transportation. 

Mr.  Boardman  made  this  argument  himself  as  chairman  of  the  rail  committee  of 
the  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials.  In  their 
intercity  rail  report,  he  wrote,  ‘‘In  normal  times  passenger  rail  service  was  impor-
tant. In the ‘new normal’ times it is critical.’’

Since  the  Federal  Government  created  Amtrak  34  years  ago,  we  have  invested 
less  than  an  average  of  one  billion  dollars  a  year  in  rail  infrastructure  and  oper-
ations—not nearly enough for a world-class system. Germany, which has a modern, 
high-speed rail system, invested nine billion dollars in passenger rail in 2003 alone. 
Instead  of  trying  to  kill  Amtrak,  we  must  build  a  passenger  rail  system  that  is  as 
good as any in the world. 

Of  course,  oversight  of  Amtrak’s  finances  is  just  one  of  the  duties  of  the  Federal 
Railroad Administrator. The primary job is to carry out and enforce the laws relat-
ing to rail safety, and I hope Mr. Boardman is up to that task. 

I  want  to  thank  all  of  these  nominees  for  being  here  today  to  share  their  views 
and  ideas  with  us,  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  them  throughout  the  con-
firmation process. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Just  in  a  short  word,  Mr.  Chairman,  we 
are  fortunate  to  have  the  kind  of  candidates  for  these  lofty  posi-
tions that we do have. And I think fair to say that Amtrak and pas-
senger  rail  service  is  a  primary  concern  of  mine,  not  the  only  one. 
But  I  am  worried,  Mr.  Boardman,  what  might  happen  if  Amtrak, 
for  instance,  stopped  running  the  Empire  service  from  New  York 
City to Niagara Falls or the Adirondack trains from New York City 
to Montreal. 

Now, would—the city of New York—you have experience there—

be prepared to pick up the costs to continue those operations? 

Mr. BOARDMAN. Let me answer, Senator, if I could, we right now 
financially support the Adirondack service that goes into Montreal. 
And  we  have  increased  that  support  substantially,  almost  four 
times, in just the last few years. So there is strong support for pas-
senger  transportation.  The  Empire  service  was  created  under  the 
original Amtrak in 1971. Which means that the State of New York 
is not required to actually support that service at this time. 

However,  New  York  provides  over  $1,400,000,000  a  year  to  sup-
port  public  transportation,  including  New  York  City,  and  has  a 
long history of doing so. That said, I do not think any state or any 
organization  today  will  voluntarily  step  up  and  add  more  dollars 
unless  called  upon.  And  I  think  that  what  is  important  to  under-
stand  in  New  York,  and  we  have  been  trying  to  do  that,  is  that  it 
is  critical  that  we  have  intercity  passenger  transportation  on  the 
Empire  corridor,  on  the  Adirondack  corridor  to  Montreal,  and  on 
the  Northeast  corridor.  We  are  financially  committed,  on  the  state 
level, to ensuring that service. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Yes,  but  Mr.  Boardman,  you  are  aware  of 
the  fact  that  the  recommendation  by  the  President  would  abolish 
much, if not all, of Amtrak’s services. And I asked you the question 
deliberately  about  the  service  on  the  two  lines  we  were  just  dis-
cussing. Is New York State—and you said that, you know, you said 
that  no  state  is  going  to  step  up  voluntarily  to  do  it.  The  question 
is:  With  your  unique  experience  in  New  York  State  and  in  rail-
roading  for  such  a  long  time,  transportation,  will  New  York  State 
be able to fully take over the responsibility of running the railroad 
from New York City on north in these two lines?

Mr.  BOARDMAN.  I  do  not  know  whether  they  will  fully  take  over 
that responsibility, but they will be committed to supporting inter-
city passenger rail. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well,  is  supporting  with  the  money  in-
cluded  or  supporting  it  in  a  philosophical  kind  of  thing?  Because 
what we are looking at is a question of whether or not we have the 
resources  to  continue  to  provide  this  intercity  passenger  rail  serv-
ice. 

Mr. BOARDMAN. No, support in the sense of money support. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. So New York State, it is in your belief that 
New  York  State  would  step  up  and  provide  all  of  the  services  that 
are  presently  there  on  their  own,  without  assistance  from  Amtrak. 

Mr. BOARDMAN. I would not say it that way. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  I  know  you  would  not,  but  I  want  you  to. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. BOARDMAN. I know you do. I can use the rocket——
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  We  are  going  to  get  along  fine,  no  mat-

Mr.  BOARDMAN.  I  can  use  the  rocket  scientist  line  again  here, 

ter——

but——

Senator LAUTENBERG. No. 
Mr. BOARDMAN. I understand. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  You  might  be  able  to  run  all  kinds  of 
things, but without the appropriate amount of fuel and resource, it 
cannot  happen.  Now  as  Chairman  of  AASHTO’s  Standing  Com-
mittee  on  Rail  Transportation,  you  are  responsible  for  the  report 
that stressed the primary role of the Federal Government to ensure 
adequate funding for passenger rail. Now, we have a zero proposal, 
a proposal of zero level for funding on passenger rail in this Fiscal 
Year  2006  budget.  If  confirmed,  how  do  you  square  your  position 
that AASHTO with the administration’s view? 

Mr.  BOARDMAN.  If  confirmed,  I  believe  we  have  to  work  in  col-
laboration.  And  there  will  not  be  zero.  If  we  can  reform  and  make 
the  changes  necessary  to  support  rail  transportation,  that  will  not 
occur. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  So  you  include  reform  as  a  condition  for 
funding.  Now,  we  do  not  have  time  to  discuss  this.  We  will—you 
and  I  will  discuss  it  personally,  privately.  But  when  you  throw  in 
a condition like that, when there has been so much cost reduction, 
personnel reduction and so forth. Mr. Gunn has led a very success-
ful attempt to reduce the costs there. 

Now,  that  constitutes  a  manner  of  reform.  But  we  have  never 
provided the capital to Amtrak that is required. If we spent $1 bil-
lion a year on average, it was a lot. In Germany, they spent $9 bil-
lion  in  1  year.  And  if  you  see  the  product  that  they  have,  it  is  not 
just money, it is will also. 

How  do  you  ensure  that  the  freight  railroads,  for  instance,  will 
give  reasonable  scheduling  priority  so  that  the  freight  delays  will 
not  hamper  passenger  service,  which  often  occurs?  Do  you  have  a 
view on that? 

Mr. BOARDMAN. Well, I think that the freight railroads have been 
supportive  and  have  to  be  supportive  and  have  to  be  supportive  of 
passenger rail under the law at this point in time. I think that this 
Congress has been helpful to the freight industry with the 4.3 cent

tax  that  it  gave  back  to  the  freight  industry.  I  think  that  we  need 
to  expect  that  the  freight  industry  is  going  to  support  what  we 
need as public policy. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  So  might  we  suggest  that  the  same  thing 
should be done with Amtrak, to give them the kind of support that 
they need? If it was a significant assist for the freight service, then 
why should we not try to duplicate that for passenger rail service? 
Mr.  BOARDMAN.  I  can  understand  and  I  think  in  collaboration, 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Thanks,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thanks  for  the 

courtesy, Senator Inouye. 

we will. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  I  am  informed  that  we  are  now  on  the  defense 
supplemental,  and  Senator  Inouye  and  I  may  be  called.  We  will 
continue  the  hearing,  though.  If  we  do,  I  hope  the  others  will  stay 
here. We have not been called yet. 

Let me ask a couple questions right now. 
Dr.  Griffin,  NASA  currently  takes  a  series  of  photographs  from 
space to deal with the training of pilots, particularly in order to get 
through  some  of  the  mountain  passes  in  our  state.  Until  recently, 
one  out  of  11  pilots  in  Alaska  died  in  plane  crashes.  And  we  have 
established what we call a Five Star Medallion Safety Program. We 
would  like  to  have  you  come  up  and  take  a  look  at  that  and  see 
what you might do to further the goal of reducing that death rate. 
Are you willing to come up to do that? 

Dr. GRIFFIN. Sir, as a general aviation flight instructor and pilot, 
if  confirmed,  I  would  absolutely  love  the  opportunity  to  come  up 
and see that. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Now,  Mr.  Boardman,  we  had  a  substantial  conversation  yester-
day. And I appreciate your courtesy in discussing with me some of 
the problems of the railroads. But I understand, and I do not want 
to  embarrass  Mrs.  Boardman,  but  I  understand  that  when  you 
asked for her hand, you asked not only for a marriage but also for 
her  to  go  to  Alaska  to  homestead.  And  she  accepted  one  and  re-
fused the other. 

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Obviously  it  is  time  now,  I  think,  perhaps  you 
should take a trip to Alaska and bring Mrs. Boardman, so she can 
see  what  she  missed,  when  you  come  to  inspect  the  Alaska  Rail-
road. Are you willing to make such a trip? 

Mrs. BOARDMAN. For thirty years. 
[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. The answer is yes, now, thank you. 
[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Mr. BOARDMAN. Whether I am confirmed or not, it seems. 
[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  I  would  like  to  accelerate  your  confirma-
tion,  too,  but  I  do  not  think  we  have  the  ability  to  do  so,  because 
we can only do this on an emergency basis. 

Senator Nelson? 
Senator  NELSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Chairman,  in 
the  interest  of  time,  I  am  going  to  be  brief,  because  our  nominee 
for NASA is obviously the right person at the right time of leader-

ship.  I  am  going  to  submit,  with  your  permission,  a  number  of  de-
tailed  questions  that  I  would  like  to  have  for  the  record,  as  we, 
well,  as  Dr.  Griffin  leads  this  agency  out  of  the  wilderness.  It  has 
been  wandering  in  the  wilderness  for  a  period  of  years.  And  it 
needs  the  strong  leadership  that  I  think  that  he  is  going  to  offer. 
I  want  to,  if  I  may,  just  take  a  couple  of  moments  here  to  have 
you state for the record what we have already talked about in pri-
vate—which  I  find  your  views  compelling—on  such  as  using  your 
ability  in  your  new  position  to  enable  NASA  to  improve  its  deci-
sion-making process on, example, accepting certain risks before we 
return to flight. Would you comment for the record on that? 

Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes, sir. Obviously, if confirmed, the very first issue 
on  the  plate,  superceding  all  others,  is  to  look  into  the  return  to 
flight  work  which  has  gone  on  in  the  more  than  2  years  since  we 
lost  Columbia,  to  understand  it,  to  understand  who  has  done  it, 
what has been done, to understand what the areas of concerns still 
are. I have been in the unfortunate position of having chaired acci-
dent  boards,  fortunately  that  did  not  involve  people.  But  when  a 
lot  of  money  is  at  stake,  one  equally  well  takes  such  things  seri-
ously.  And  I  am  very  aware  that  accident  boards  make  rec-
ommendations that seem good to them at the time, but which may 
not in all cases be capable of implementation. 

We will, of course, face that same thing with the return to flight. 
And  in  fact,  those  who  pay  attention  to  the  space  media  note  that 
there  is  a  certain  amount  of  contentiousness  ongoing  right  now  as 
to exactly what state of completion our Shuttle return to flight ex-
ercise can reach before we decide to go and accept the risk remain-
ing. 

So  nothing  will  be  more  important  to  me  than  looking  into  all 
that.  Also,  as  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board  so  thor-
oughly  elucidated,  one  of  the  things  we  want  to  make  sure  is  that 
we  hear  from  all  parties,  that  there  is  no  information  that  needs 
to reach the top that fails to reach the top. And that will be a huge 
priority. 

Senator  NELSON.  And  I  confirm  your  concern  as  a  leader,  that  I 
have  often  felt  that  the  last  two  tragedies  that  we  have  had  in 
NASA,  first  Challenger  and  then  Columbia,  although  destruction 
for different technical reasons, really, it was a common theme. And 
that is that the top level management was not listening to the en-
gineers  on  the  line.  And  that  was  in  fact  the  case  with  Challenger 
in 1986 and again with Columbia. So I thank you for that. 

Share  with  the  Committee  your  concern  about  the  potential  hia-
tus where we would be without an American vehicle for human ac-
cess to space perhaps in a situation for years relying upon the Rus-
sians  and  where  the  geopolitics  would  take  us  in  those  years,  that 
suddenly Russia might not be a reliable person, a reliable partner, 
for access to space, for human access to space. Share your thoughts 
about that hiatus between the schedule of 2010, shutting down the 
Shuttle,  and  several  years  later  possibly  before  we  would  have  the 
crew exploration vehicle ready to go. 

Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you, Senator. As a matter of fact, my second 
priority, if confirmed, would be to address exactly the gap to which 
you  refer.  Because  I  think  this  is  an  area  that  means  a  lot  to  me. 
As  a  matter  of  what  it  takes  to  be  a  great  Nation  in  the  21st  cen-

tury,  I  do  not  believe  that  we  would  wish  to  see  a  situation  where 
the United States is dependent upon any partner, reliable or unre-
liable,  at  any  time,  for  human  access  to  space  or,  for  that  matter, 
any access to space. 

We need our own capabilities. Two Nations have now put people 
into  space  since  the  United  States  has  last  done  so.  I  do  not  like 
that.  The  program  that  NASA  has  outlined  so  far  features  a  new 
crew exploration vehicle. We can call it what we will. And it nomi-
nally  comes  on  line  in  2014.  I  think  that  is  too  far  out.  President 
Bush  said  not  later  than  2014.  He  did  not  say  we  could  not  be 
smart and do it early. And that would be my goal. 

I  would  call  the  Committee’s  attention  to  the  fact  that  when  the 
United  States  developed  its  Gemini  spacecraft,  it  did  so  from  con-
tract  award  to  first  flight  in  a  period  of  something  like  38,  39 
months,  a  little  over  3  years.  Even  the  Apollo  spacecraft,  a  much 
more  challenging  development,  whose  development  was  in  fact  in-
terrupted by a fatal fire that killed three astronauts, even the Apol-
lo  spacecraft  was  brought  from  contract  award  to  fruition  in  no 
more than 6 years. 

It  seems  unacceptable  to  me  that  it  should  take  from  2005  to 

2014 to do the same thing when we already know how. 

The CHAIRMAN. Your time has expired. I am sorry. 
Senator  NELSON.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  only  ask  at  some  point 
in the nominee’s testimony, if he might share his vision for the fu-
ture of NASA, because I think we will hear a refreshing statement. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
It is my understanding that the Senator’s questions as submitted 
for  the  record  would  not  be  intended  to  hold  up  the  confirmation 
process. 

Senator NELSON. Oh, absolutely not. Absolutely not. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Hutchison? 
Senator  HUTCHISON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Chairman, 
I  have  been  trying  to  work  on  the  priorities  of  the  Subcommittee. 
And  one  of  the  priorities  was  the  question  that  was  just  asked  by 
Senator  Nelson.  It  has,  as  I  have  discussed  with  Dr.  Griffin,  been 
of  great  concern  to  me  that  we  would  have  a  5-year  hiatus  on  the 
books  in  which  we  would  be  able  to  put  our  own  people  in  space. 
And I appreciate that that is also a concern of yours. 

I  think  it  is,  in  addition  to  a  potential  problem  in  stopping  the 
science  that  is  done  at  the  Shuttle,  I  mean  at  the  Space  Station, 
I  think  it  is  a  security  issue  for  our  country  when  we  are  seeing, 
as you pointed out, other countries going into space. 

So  I  will  be  looking.  And  we  will  be  holding  hearings.  And  cer-
tainly  when  I  am  able  to  hold  our  Subcommittee  hearings,  I  will 
have  you  back,  and  we  will  be  able  to  discuss  these  things  more 
fully.  But  of  the  priorities  that  I  have  after  return  to  flight,  the  5-
year hiatus is the biggest. We have a commitment to international 
partners in the Space Station. You said something in your opening 
statement that you support the Space Station, but we have to make 
sure  that  putting  people  in  space  is  for  a  mission  worthy  of  the 
risk. 

And I agree with you, of course, that going to Mars should be the 
next vision. But I want to make sure that we also have the commit-
ment  to  our  international  partners  to  finish  the  Space  Station  and

that  we  look  for  the  ways  to  enhance  the  science  so  that  it  is  wor-
thy of the efforts that we are making, both in the medical research, 
which we are now doing, and potentially with geophysical research, 
from  what  we  might  get  on  the  moon  and  then  maybe  into  the 
long-term future, Mars. 

And  I  just  wanted  to  ask  you  if  you  are  committed  to  finishing 
the  Space  Station  and  if  you  have  other  ideas  about  the  kinds  of 
science that we can do that would be worthy of the risk of manned 
space flight. 

Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes, Senator. Let me assure you first that your pri-
ority  to,  as  I  just  said  in  response  to  Senator  Nelson’s  question, 
your  priority  to  reduce  any  gap  in  access  to  space  by  our  Nation 
after  the  Shuttle  retirement  is  also  my  priority.  We  are  of  like 
mind. It remains to find ways and means. But we are of like mind 
on that. 

With  regard  to  the  International  Space  Station,  yes,  the  Presi-
dent  is  pledged,  and  I,  as  his  nominee,  am  pledged,  if  confirmed, 
to  bring  the  International  Space  Station  to  a  level  of  completion 
consistent  with  our  obligations  to  our  international  partners.  The 
faith  and  credence  of  the  United  States  in  meeting  its  obligations 
means  something  to  me.  It  means  quite  a  lot  to  me.  We  have  un-
dergone  a  trauma  in  our  space  program,  as  you  know  all  too  well. 
We are still recovering from that and there has been damage to the 
program,  and  there  have  been  delays  to  the  program.  But  we  are 
committed to meeting our obligations to our partners. 

With  regard  to  the  science  that  can  be  done  on  the  Station,  as 
I know that you are aware, it consists, of course, first and foremost, 
life science research in connection with the effect of zero gravity on 
the  human  body  in  preparation  for  longer  voyages.  It  also  serves, 
or  can  serve,  as  a  test  bed  for  engineering  development  hardware 
before  that  hardware  is  subjected  to  long  journeys  far  from  home. 
It can possibly serve, as you indicated, in observation or other type 
of scientific platform. 

You know, the utilization of it remains yet to be fully fleshed out. 
But  certainly  having  built  it,  it  would  be  my  commitment  to  use 
it for whatever makes sense to use. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  So  you  can  foresee  that  there  could  be 
equipment  testing,  as  perhaps  we  go  back  and  forth  to  the  moon, 
that  could—I  mean,  to—I  am  sorry,  to  the  moon  that  could  also 
eventually  help  us  in  knowing  what  it  would  take  to  go  to  Mars? 
Dr. GRIFFIN. I have often thought that the most valuable applica-
tion of any space station would be simply a place to check out hard-
ware that is in nascent stages of development, not fully understood. 
It  provides  a  lot  more  opportunity  for  interaction  with  that  hard-
ware than aerospace engineers usually get. Most of the time we de-
sign it, we build it, we launch it, and we hope we did it right. 

Senator HUTCHISON. Thank you. 
With  my  last  minute  I  would  like  to  just  ask  a  question  to  Mr. 
Boardman.  Senator  Dorgan  and  I  have  just  introduced  legislation. 
And I was very pleased to work on this with him because of a situ-
ation  that  happened  in  San  Antonio,  Texas,  last  year  where—and 
it  just—it  happens  in  other  parts  of  the  country  as  well.  It  just 
happened  that  we  had  a  huge  wreck  and  it  was  going  through  a 
major  metropolitan  area.  And  we  know  that  hazardous  materials

carriage  going  through  metropolitan  areas  is  an  issue  that  affects 
many communities. 

Our bill would require railroads to improve inspections of welded 
track,  develop  tank  car  safety  standards,  and  ask,  or  actually  di-
rect,  the  FRA  to  do  a  relevant  rulemaking.  And  I  just  wanted  to 
ask you if you are familiar with this issue and if you are committed 
to  better  inspection  capabilities  by  the  railroads  and  better  over-
sight from the FRA and also the issue of tank car integrity. 

Mr.  BOARDMAN.  Senator,  I  am  familiar  with  at  least  part  of  the 
issue. And I will, if confirmed, pay attention to the HAZMAT issue, 
not  only  in  terms  of  the  technical  characteristics  of  the  cars,  but 
also in some of the balance of how we are going to notify and oper-
ate those cars. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  And  working  with  the  communities  in-

Mr. BOARDMAN. Absolutely. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator HUTCHISON. Thank you. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Senators,  I  have  urged  the  staff  to  notify  absent 
Senators,  but  we  will  meet  in  the  President’s  room  right  after  the 
next  vote  or  at  2:15  today,  whichever  occurs  first,  on  the  nomina-
tion. 

I now recognize Senator Pryor.

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR,

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
My time is short here so, Mr. Griffin, I would like to focus some 
questions  with  you  first.  Something  that  has  been  in  the  news  re-
cently is the Hubble Spacecraft, or the Hubble Telescope. And I am 
hearing, I guess, conflicting reports, or maybe I do not understand 
exactly  what  is  going  on.  I  think  that  some  are  saying  we  should 
just  pretty  much  abandon  it  and  let  it  die,  and  others  are  saying 
no,  we  can  send  up  some  sort  of  robotic  spacecraft  and  get  it,  you 
know, reworked for a longer life. 

Tell  me  the  status  of  that  and  tell  me  the  value  of  the  Hubble 

Telescope, if you can. 

Dr. GRIFFIN. Let me comment on the second issue first, the value 
of  the  Hubble.  I  guess  the  shortest  way  in  which  I  could  express 
it  is  that  the  Hubble  almost  by  itself  is  the  instrument  which  al-
lowed us, as a race of people, but our scientists in particular, to un-
derstand that it is quite literally true that we know nothing about 
95 percent of the known universe. Seventy-five percent of it is dark 
energy, 20 percent of it is so-called dark matter, and the remaining 
5 percent is what we can see. 

That is an understanding so profound as to rival with Einstein’s 
development  of  the  theories  of  relativity  and  so  forth.  So  it  has 
been an extraordinarily valuable instrument. 

Senator  PRYOR.  And  is  it  your  opinion  that  it  would  have  value 

in the future? 

Dr. GRIFFIN. If it were working right, of course it would continue 
to  have  value  in  the  future.  Yes,  sir,  and  the  issue  remains  as  to 
what we do. To answer now your first question second, sir——

Senator PRYOR. Right.

Dr  Griffin.—the  ability  to  deal  with  it.  A  robotic  mission  has 
been  studied.  Actually,  until  I  was  nominated  by  the  President  to 
be his choice for Administrator, I was the independent chair of the 
Robotic  Servicing  Mission  design  review  committee.  As  you  know 
and as was in the news very recently, that committee, now without 
me  as  its  head,  that  committee  has  concluded  that  the  Robotic 
Servicing  Mission  is  not  feasible  within  reasonable  amounts,  for 
reasonable  amounts  of  money,  and  within  the  time  we  have  avail-
able before the Hubble wears out, if you will. 

So I would like to take the robotic mission off the plate. I believe 
that is a correct assessment and so I believe that the choice comes 
down  to  reinstating  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  or  possibly  a  very 
simple  robotic  deorbiting  mission.  The  decision  not  to  execute  the 
Shuttle,  the  planned  Shuttle  servicing  mission,  was  made  in  the 
immediate  aftermath  of  the  loss  of  Columbia.  When  we  return  to 
flight,  it  will  be  with  essentially  a  new  vehicle  which  will  have  a 
new risk analysis associated with it and so on and so forth. 

At that time, I think we should reassess the earlier decision and 
in light of what we learn after we return to flight, we should revisit 
the earlier decision. 

Senator PRYOR. OK. 
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Did  I  answer  responsively?  I  mean,  I  was  rather 

long-winded and I am sorry. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Yes.  That  is  good.  Now  let  me  ask  you  about 
NASA as an agency. I know there has been some financial manage-
ment  issues  there.  In  fact,  as  I  understand  it,  NASA’s  auditors 
have not been able to conduct an audit for three of the last 4 years. 
And  there  may  not  be  a  clean  audit  in  FY05.  Is  that  your  under-
standing? 

Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes, sir, that is my understanding. 
Senator  PRYOR.  And  what  is  the  cause  of  that?  And  why  is  that 
happening in this Agency? And understandably, Congress has a lot 
of  concerns  about  that.  And,  you  know,  frankly,  you  need  to  get 
your  fiscal  house  in  order.  But  tell  me  the  cause  of  that  and  what 
you plan on doing to fix it. 

Dr. GRIFFIN. Sir, I in no way have the appropriate knowledge at 
this  time  to  comment  on  the  cause.  So  I  will  have  to—and  if  con-
firmed,  I  absolutely  look  forward  to  getting  back  to  you  to  explain 
what we have found when we know. But right now, I do not know. 
Senator  PRYOR.  I  think  that  has  got  to  be  one  of  your  top  prior-

ities, though. 

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  It  is.  It  absolutely  is.  I  have,  as  was  pointed  out  in 
my introduction, I have been at NASA. I have been a contractor to 
NASA. When I was in the Defense Department, I have been a cus-
tomer  for  NASA.  Since  I  have  been  a  contractor,  I  have  been  held 
to  demanding  accounting  standards  for  how  we  spent  our  money, 
as should be the case. It is not acceptable for NASA to do less well 
in accounting for its expenditures to the Congress. 

I am given to understand that there is an excellent Chief Finan-
cial  Officer  in  charge  at  NASA.  I  just  met  her  this  morning.  I  am 
also given to understand that it may well be true that she has not 
received all of the resources necessary to accomplish her job. I plan 
to meet with her literally on my first day and understand what she 
needs to accomplish her task and to see to it that she can do that.

It  is  unacceptable  that  we  cannot  pass  an  impartial  audit  and  ac-
count to you for how we have expended our funds. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Yes.  I  agree  with  that.  And  I  am  glad  you  are 

going to make that such a high priority. 

And the last question I wanted to ask is not so much about space 
flight  or  even  agency  but  science  and  education.  And  you  have  the 
EPSCoR program. Are you familiar with EPSCoR? 

Dr. GRIFFIN. I am not, sir. 
Senator PRYOR. Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive 

Dr. GRIFFIN. I am not familiar with it, I am sorry to say. 
Senator  PRYOR.  OK.  Well,  I  tell  you  what,  I  will  just  write  out 
a question for you for the record, and not to hold up the confirma-
tion, but I would like your thoughts on that. 

Research. 

Thank you. 
Dr. GRIFFIN. I would welcome the opportunity. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Allen? 

STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE ALLEN,

U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA 

Senator ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I am going to focus my comments to you, Dr. Griffin. And it has 
to  do  with  the  NASA  budget.  I  intend  to  support  you.  But  let  me 
tell you, every time you come before this Committee, I am going to 
voice  concern  about  the  Aeronautics  Industry.  I  am  a  competitive 
person. I think everyone in this Committee, whether they are from 
Alaska  or  from  Virginia  or  from  Texas  or  from  anywhere  else,  are 
concerned  about  the  aeronautics  funding  because  air  travel  affects 
us all. 

One  of  the  great  strengths  in  the  20th  century,  of  America  and 
its  leadership,  was  in  aeronautics.  We  have  fallen  behind.  For  the 
first  time  ever,  going  from  90  percent  of  the  commercial  aviation 
market in the 1940s, we for the first time have come in second last 
year, down to 45 percent of global sales. 

I have looked at the funding for the aeronautics aspect of NASA. 
In  the  previous  administration,  research  and  development  was  cut 
in  half.  This  current  administration  and  this  proposed  budget  pro-
poses  another  cut  in  half,  which  is  forcing  some  of  our  research 
centers to lay off capable, uniquely skilled individuals, who are not 
readily found in the market. 

Moreover,  there  is  a  concern  about  young  people  in  engineering, 
particularly  aeronautical  engineering.  This  certainly  does  not  send 
a  positive  message,  if  we  care  to  be  a  leader  in  aeronautics,  which 
I  think  is  important  for  our  security  and  for  prosperity  in  this 
country. 

When  one  looks  at  all  the  developments  and  the  improvements 
in  aviation  over  the  years,  many  of  those,  whether  it  is  civilian  or 
for  military  aircraft,  came  from  the  R&D,  the  high-risk  research 
that  was  done  at  our  research  centers,  NASA  research  centers, 
around the country. 

Now I understand that you have yet to be confirmed as Adminis-
trator,  but  I  would  like  for  you  to  explain  to  me  and  to  our  Com-
mittee  the  rationale  behind  the  dramatic  cuts  in  the  new  vehicle 
systems program, which is conducting research on the feasibility of

hypersonic flight. Hypersonic flight is that of the speed above Mach 
5. They are also researching the development of zero emissions air-
craft. 

Could  you  share  with  me  and  our  Committee  the  rationale  for 
these  further  drastic  cuts  in  aeronautics  and,  moreover,  why  the 
cuts in the new vehicle systems? 

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Senator  Allen,  I  cannot  share  that  rationale  with 
you, because I do not know it. If confirmed, I will take it as an ac-
tion  to  study  that,  those  issues,  and  to  get  back  to  you,  to  work 
with  you  and  your  staff  in  explaining  our  rationale.  But  as  of 
today, I do not have it. 

I  share  your  view  as  to  the  cruciality  of  aeronautics  research. 
Like  you,  I  am  a  competitive  person  and  also  find  it  more  than 
somewhat  worrisome  that  last  year  we  were  below  50  percent  of 
the  market  share,  having  once  had  90  percent.  We  also  have  a 
statement  on  the  record  in  the  European  Union  that  the  goal  of 
Airbus  is  to  dominate  the  world  market  in  air  transport.  I  think 
that the United States should be worried about that. And I am. 

But  with  respect  to  your  question  today,  with  what  I  know  at 

this moment, I cannot answer. 

Senator  ALLEN.  Well,  in  the  event  that  we  are  going  to  address 
the concerted plan, which they are effectuating in Europe to domi-
nate by the year 2020, and they are investing a great deal, billions 
of dollars, in research and development, and producing quality air-
craft, do you see cutting research and development for new vehicle 
systems  in  aeronautics  as  a  way  of  addressing  that  competitive 
challenge  that  we  are  facing,  which  is  important,  again,  for  our 
military, for civilian aircraft and it actually is also good for our bal-
ance  of  trade.  And  most  of  our  balance  of  trade  is  not  very  good 
these days. 

So  do  you  see  cutting  research  and  development  by  half  again, 
so  it  is  about  one-quarter  of  what  it  was  10  years  ago,  do  you  see 
that as a logical, rational way of handling this or addressing it? 

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Well,  sir,  as  I  do  not  have  to  explain  to  you,  I  am 
the  President’s  nominee  and  I  support  the  President’s  program. 
However,  the  President  understands  that  the  determination  of  the 
budget  in  the  final  analysis  is  an  iterative  process.  I  look  forward 
to  working  with  you  and  your  staff  on  those  iterations  to  arrive  at 
an approach which is acceptable to all parties. 

Senator ALLEN. Well, I look forward to working with you. Under-
stand,  in  our  private  conversation  we  discussed  this  as  well,  how 
important I feel this is for the future of our country. I feel that we 
ought to be concerned that, for example, the most advanced fighter 
must  be  tested  overseas  in  wind  tunnels  in  Europe,  because  our 
own country has failed to invest in our own wind tunnels. 

And  so  it  is  my  view  that—I  know  there  are  a  lot  of  priorities 
and  we  do  need  to  be  in  the  lead  in  space,  but  we  also  need  to  be 
paying attention to the very practical, beneficial aspects of research 
and  development  here  in  this  country,  working  with  the  private 
sector,  working  with  defense,  in  aeronautics.  And  I  just  cannot 
countenance  seeing  the  atrophying  of  a  very  capable  skilled  work 
force  plus  the  encouragement  for  the  future  with  these,  I  think, 
penny-wise-and-pound-foolish proposals.

And  so  as  the  legislative  branch  disposes  of  proposals—and  I 
know  that.  And  as  a  Governor,  I  appreciate  agency  heads  who  fol-
low  the  executive.  However,  I  am  glad  you  understand  the  legisla-
tive process. And I hope to work with my colleagues to improve the 
aeronautics funding, particularly for the new vehicle system, which 
is important for the future. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Senator,  I  will  be  happy  to  discuss  with  you 
sometime  the  availability  of  money  for  that  research  and  the  re-
dundancy of the current research. 

Senator Inouye? 
Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  will  be  submitting  my  ques-
tions. But I would like to ask Dr. Griffin to do his very best to keep 
Hubble alive. 

And  to  Mr.  Boardman,  as  you  may  know  or  may  not  know,  we 
in  Hawaii  have  one  narrow-gauge  railroad.  It  is  about  two  miles 
long.  So  we  are  not  quite  ready  for  Amtrak.  But  I  will  be  sup-
porting you. 

Mr. BOARDMAN. Thank you, Senator. 
Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you, Senator. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. In other words, you do not 

have an excuse to go to Hawaii. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. BOARDMAN. We will make one up. 
[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you  very  much,  gentlemen.  And  I  hope 

you will respond to the questions that we may submit to you. 

And Dr. Griffin, we look forward to contacting you later. 
Mr.  Boardman,  we  will  determine  how  quickly  we  can  get  your 
nomination  out.  We  will  have  a  hearing  markup  tomorrow—no, 
Thursday,  Thursday.  And  we  will  do  our  best  to  have  it  ready  for 
that time. 

I will now turn to the next panel. Thank you very much, gentle-

men. 

Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thanks to your family. 
Mr. BOARDMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Committee.

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  been  called  to  re-
spond to an amendment by Senator Cochran, but I did want to say 
that I have known Nancy Nord for longer than I even want to say, 
at least 30 years. And she is the most qualified person for this posi-
tion. I know she will do a wonderful job. 

And  I  hope  that  our  Committee  will  expedite  her  approval,  as 

well. Thank you.

COMMISSIONER, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION 
Ms.  NORD.  Yes,  sir.  Although  I  do  not  have  family  with  me  this 
morning,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  Commissioner  Thomas 
Moore,  who  will  be  my  colleague  on  the  CPSC,  if  confirmed.  Com-
missioner  Moore  is  well  known  to  this  Committee.  And  I  wanted 
to acknowledge his presence. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you.  We  are  pleased  to  have  you  here, 

Commissioner.

The CHAIRMAN. Ms. Nancy Nord has been nominated to be Com-
missioner  of  Consumer  Products  Safety  Commission.  The  Honor-
able  William  Cobey  is  nominated  to  be  a  member  of  the  board  of 
directors  of  the  Metropolitan  Washington  Airports  Authority.  Let 
me ask you if you have family with you today that you wish to in-
troduce for the record, either of you? 

Mr. COBEY. No, sir. 
Ms. NORD. No, sir. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Senator  Inouye  and  I  are  pleased  to  be  able  to 
consider  the  nomination.  Do  you  have  any  opening  statement  to 
make on these nominees? 

Senator INOUYE. Fine candidates. 
The CHAIRMAN. And my opening statement, which I placed in the 
record,  I  identified  your  backgrounds,  each  of  you.  And  we  under-
stand that Senator Thune and Senator Johnson support Ms. Nord’s 
nomination.  Senator  Dole  and  Senator  Burr  support  Mr.  Cobey. 
And their statements will be placed in the record. 

The CHAIRMAN. We are pleased to consider your nomination. 
Ms. Nord, do you have a statement that you would like to make? 

STATEMENT OF NANCY A. NORD, NOMINEE TO BE 

Ms. NORD. Thank you. The biographical information I submitted 
to  the  Committee  for  the  record  outlines  my  personal  and  profes-
sional  background.  This  morning  I  wanted  to  just  briefly  tell  you 
why  I  would  like  to  be  on  the  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commis-
sion and give you a sense of the things I would like to accomplish, 
if confirmed. 

I am eager to be a CPSC Commissioner for several reasons. First 
of  all,  I  strongly  believe  in  the  mission  of  the  agency.  American 
consumers  have  every  right  to  expect  that  the  products  that  they 
purchase will be safe and will not pose an unreasonable risk of in-
jury to themselves or their families. 

Second,  I  am  pleased  to  have  been  chosen  for  this  position,  be-
cause  I  have  a  long  interest  in  the  activities  of  the  agency.  As  a 
young  lawyer  right  out  of  law  school,  one  of  the  very  first  issues 
I  worked  on  was  the  legislation  creating  the  Consumer  Product 
Safety  Commission.  Later,  as  a  Hill  staffer,  I  worked  on  consumer 
protection  matters,  including  oversight  and  authorization  legisla-
tion for the agency. 

In the 30 years since it was established, the agency has built up 
an  impressive  record  of  accomplishments.  And  I  am  eager  to  do 
what I can to push forward the mission of the agency. 

With respect to priorities, the Commission has a special responsi-
bility to vulnerable population groups such as the elderly and espe-
cially children. While the Commission has made significant strides 
with  respect  to  the  safety  of  toys  and  other  children’s  products,

37

there is always more to be done. This is an area of special concern 
to me and if confirmed, is an area where I will give strong empha-
sis. 

On  a  related  matter,  it  is  critical  that  once  a  product  —unsafe 
product—has been recalled, that we assure ourselves that the prod-
uct  is  really  out  of  consumers’  hands.  We  should  continue  to  ex-
plore  a  variety  of  ways  to  track  and  measure  product  recall  effec-
tiveness, including the use of new technologies. 

While  I  believe  that  American  manufacturers  generally  have  an 
excellent  record  in  producing  safe  products,  I  also  recognize  that 
many  products  on  our  store  shelves  are  manufactured  overseas. 
Under  the  leadership  of  Chairman  Stratton,  the  Commission  has 
begun  work  with  safety  officials  in  other  countries  to  harmonize 
safety  regulations  and  to  assure  that  products  manufactured  out-
side the U.S. meet our high standards. I look forward to supporting 
this important work that the Commission has begun. 

Before  I  close,  I  want  to  mention  to  you  the  importance  that  I 
place  on  open  communication.  If  confirmed,  I  am  committed  to  es-
tablishing an open communication process to assure that I have the 
benefit  of  rigorous  debate  and  all  points  of  view  before  reaching  a 
decision.  Consumer  groups,  business  entities,  the  standard-setting 
bodies can be assured that I strongly believe in an open-door policy 
and  will  be  proactively  looking  for  their  input  on  issues  before  the 
Commission. 

Serving as a CPSC Commissioner is a high honor and a tremen-
dous  responsibility.  If  confirmed,  I  commit  that  I  will  undertake 
this  responsibility  with  integrity,  enthusiasm,  and  full  dedication. 
Thank you, sir. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Ms. Nord.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF NANCY A. NORD, NOMINEE TO BE COMMISSIONER, 

CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  it  is  an  honor  to  appear  before 
you  today  as  the  President’s  nominee  to  be  a  Member  of  the  Consumer  Product 
Safety Commission (‘‘CPSC’’). I welcome the opportunity to talk with you about the 
Commission and to answer any questions you may have. 

To give you an overview of my background, I was born and raised in Sioux Falls, 
South Dakota, where most of my family still lives. I graduated from the University 
of Nebraska and then attended George Washington University Law School at night, 
while  working  during  the  day  as  a  Senate  staffer.  Twenty-one  years  ago,  I  married 
James  S.  Halpern,  a  Judge  on  the  United  States  Tax  Court.  We  have  an  18  year 
old daughter, who is a freshman in college. 

My  professional  background  includes  service  as  counsel  to  the  House  Commerce 
Committee (where I handled consumer protection issues, including those relating to 
the  CPSC),  general  counsel  to  the  President’s  Council  Of  Environmental  Quality, 
private  law  practice,  starting  and  leading  a  professional  association,  and  managing 
the  Federal  Government  relations  function  of  a  large  consumer  products  company. 
I  have  long  had  an  interest  in  the  activities  of  the  CPSC.  One  of  the  first  issues 
I worked on as a young lawyer, thirty years ago, was the original legislation estab-
lishing  the  Commission.  As  a  hill  staffer,  I  worked  on  authorizing  legislation  and 
oversight  of  the  agency.  I  believe  that  the  mission  of  the  agency  is  of  vital  impor-
tance  to  the  lives  of  every  person  in  this  country  and  I  am  committed  to  working 
aggressively to assure that the Commission carries out its statutory mission. 

From  my  experience  in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors,  I  firmly  believe  it  is 
critical  that  the  agency  involve  in  its  deliberations  all  stakeholders,  including  pri-
vate  industry,  consumer  groups,  state  public  health  and  law  enforcement  officials, 
and  other  federal  agencies.  If  confirmed,  I  am  committed  to  establishing  an  open

communications process to assure that I have the benefit of vigorous debate and all 
points  of  view  before  reaching  a  decision  on  an  issue.  I  also  understand  that  Con-
gress,  and  especially  this  Committee,  is  vitally  interested  in  the  Commission’s  ac-
tivities. If confirmed, I will assure that there continues to be open and full commu-
nication  with  you  and  your  staff,  and  that  the  agency  is  fully  responsive  to  any 
questions or issues you may have. 

The  activities  of  the  agency  break  down  into  three  main  areas,  (1)  identifying 
products  that  present  unreasonable  risks  and  developing  uniform  safety  standards 
to  protect  against  those  risks,  (2)  educating  consumers  about  the  relative  safety  of 
consumer products and about compliance actions taken by the Commission, and (3) 
a law enforcement function, which assures compliance with the statute. I would like 
to outline my priorities with respect to each of these activities. 

With  respect  to  the  standards  setting  process,  the  Consumer  Product  Safety  Act 
is  unique  in  its  direction  to  the  Commission  to  work  with  interested  parties  to  de-
velop  voluntary  safety  standards  if  such  standards  would  be  adequate  to  address  a 
particular  risk.  The  voluntary  standards  mechanism  that  Congress  built  into  the 
Act  assures  that  the  standards-setting  process  is  a  collaborative  one  involving  all 
stakeholders.  It  gives  incentive  to  manufacturers  to  design  for  safety.  The  commis-
sion should encourage product manufacturers, working cooperatively with consumer 
and standard setting groups in appropriate situations, to design safety into products 
so that regulatory action by the commission is a rare occurrence. 

With  respect  to  consumer  education  and  outreach,  I  believe  that  much  needs  to 
be  done  to  alert  consumers  about  potential  safety  issues.  In  addition,  we  need  to 
continue developing more imaginative ways to get unsafe products out of the hands 
of  consumers.  However,  this  is  not  something  the  agency  can  do  alone.  it  is  vital 
that the agency work closely with the states’ attorneys general, state and local pub-
lic health officials, educators, and community organizations, especially those serving 
consumers  who  are  less  fortunate  economically  and  consumers  who  do  not  speak 
English as their first language, to assure that those closest to the people have infor-
mation about safety issues and product risks. 

With  respect  to  the  agency’s  law  enforcement  function,  I  am  committed  to  vigor-
ously  enforcing  the  law:  Those  who  do  not  comply  with  the  statute  should  be  pun-
ished.  As  our  world  gets  smaller  and  manufacturing  becomes  global  in  scale,  it  is 
important that we assure consumers that consumer products coming into this coun-
try  are  safe  and  meet  U.S.  safety  standards.  Counterfeit  products  pose  a  special 
problem.  Not  only  do  counterfeit  products  impose  unfair  competitive  burdens  on 
American  manufacturers,  but  they  also  can  pose  real  safety  hazards  for  American 
consumers. 

Finally,  the  Commission  has  a  special  obligation  to  protect  vulnerable  population 
groups, especially the elderly and the young. You have my full assurance that I will 
work  tirelessly  to  assure  that  consumer  products  posing  unreasonable  risks  to  chil-
dren and the elderly are dealt with quickly and efficiently. 

Serving as a CPSC Commissioner is a serious responsibility and a tremendous op-
portunity to work with a talented and dedicated staff. If confirmed, I commit to you 
that I will undertake the job of Commissioner with enthusiasm and integrity.

STATEMENT  OF  HON.  WILLIAM  W.  COBEY,  JR.,  NOMINEE  TO 
THE  BOARD  OF  DIRECTORS,  METROPOLITAN  WASHINGTON 
AIRPORTS AUTHORITY 
Mr.  COBEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Inouye.  I  was 
certainly  honored  to  have  my  home  state  Senators,  outstanding 
leaders,  Senators  Dole  and  Burr,  introduce  me.  And  I  have  sub-
mitted a statement for the record. I appreciate this hearing, consid-
eration of my nomination by the President. And I would be glad to 
answer any questions you might have for me at this time. 

[The  prepared  statement  and  biographical  information  of  Mr. 

Cobey follow:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM W. COBEY, JR., NOMINEE TO THE BOARD 

OF DIRECTORS, METROPOLITAN WASHINGTON AIRPORTS AUTHORITY 

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: 
I am Bill Cobey, the President’s nominee to the Metropolitan Washington Airports 
Authority. I would succeed the Honorable John Paul Hammerschmidt, who has been 
closely  involved  with  Washington’s  two  airports  since  the  Congress  agreed  to  turn 
them over to a public regional authority in 1986. 

As  you  can  see  from  the  Committee’s  record,  my  principal  qualifications  for  this 
appointment are found in my years of governmental service. I was introduced to air-
port  politics  and  policies  when  I  had  responsibility  for  the  airports  in  North  Caro-
lina  as  Deputy  Secretary  of  the  North  Carolina  Department  of  Transportation,  and 
later as Town Manager of Morrisville, North Carolina which is located immediately 
adjacent to the Raleigh-Durham Airport. 

I have long been involved with the Republican Party in North Carolina, and I am 
proud  to  have  actively  supported  the  election  of  the  two  outstanding  Senators  who 
introduced me this morning. I had the honor of representing the good people of the 
fourth  district  of  North  Carolina  as  a  Member  of  the  House  of  Representatives  for 
one  term  in  the  mid  1980s  when  the  Airports  Authority  was  established  under  the 
visionary leadership of then Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole. 

The  Airports  Authority  customarily  invites  nominees  to  attend  its  meetings,  and 
I  have  already  attended  a  Board  meeting  and  five  committee  meetings.  The  Board 
is very active and its members are well informed. I very much look forward to work-
ing with my colleagues there. 

As  you  may  know,  the  Metropolitan  Washington  Airports  is  a  public  agency  cre-
ated by interstate compact between the Commonwealth of Virginia and the District 
of  Columbia  solely  to  operate  Ronald  Reagan  Washington  National  Airport  and 
Washington  Dulles  International  Airport  under  lease  from  the  United  States.  It  is 
governed by a Board of 13 Members. Five are appointed by the Governor of Virginia, 
three  by  the  Mayor  of  the  District  of  Columbia,  two  by  the  Governor  of  Maryland 
and three by the President. 

I am told that the Presidential members are among the most active and have the 
best attendance records. They are also mindful of the statutory direction, in the fed-
eral  Metropolitan  Washington  Airports  Act,  to  ‘‘ensure  adequate  consideration  is 
given to the national interest.’’ I can assure the Committee that this record will con-
tinue if I am confirmed. 

I appreciate your consideration of my nomination. I would be happy to answer any 

questions.

The CHAIRMAN. Do you also agree that you will come before this 

Committee if requested, without a subpoena? 

Mr. COBEY. Absolutely. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you.  We  appreciate  that  each  of  you 
agreed  to  meet  and  discuss  your  nominations  before  this  hearing. 
The questions that we had were satisfied, I believe. 

Senator Inouye. 
Senator INOUYE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have just two short 

questions. 

What are your views, Mr. Cobey, on adding a few more long-dis-

tance flights from Reagan? 

Mr.  COBEY.  Certainly  I  am  open  to  that,  Senator.  I  understand 
that that has to be—at least my understanding is it has to be done 
in  statute  at  this  point  in  time.  But  I  am  certainly  open  to  more 
flights beyond the perimeter. 

Senator INOUYE. And to Ms. Nord—thank you very much, 
Mr. Cobey. 
Mr. COBEY. Yes, sir. 
Senator  INOUYE.  Currently  the  agency  has  a  cap  on  the  fines, 

$7,000 per product with a ceiling of 1.65 million. 

Ms. NORD. Yes, sir. 
Senator INOUYE. We have been receiving letters and e-mail from 
other  interested  parties  citing,  for  example,  that  on  June  2003 
Endovascular  Technologies  was  fined  over  $92  million  in  civil  and 
criminal penalties by FDA. Consumer groups would like to see the 
caps  removed  entirely.  They  argue  that  low  caps  are  no  deterrent. 
And  large  corporations  can  factor  certain  civil  penalties  into  their 
cost of doing business. 

What  are  your  thoughts  on  raising  the  cap  or  eliminating  the 

Ms. NORD. I am aware, Senator, that the agency recently has im-
posed fines of record proportion for the CPSC. And they have been 
well publicized in the newspapers. I think you raise an interesting 
question.  I  do  not  have  a  strong  view  that  the  caps  are  either  ap-
propriate  or  inappropriate,  sir.  I  would  like  to  take  a  look  at  that 
and  come  back  to  you  and  your  staff.  I  am  certainly  very  open  to 
considering that, if that would be a more effective deterrent. 

Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. 
Mr. Chairman, I favor all of the nominees. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator. 
Ms.  Nord,  I  have  been  reminded  that  the  Consumer  Product 
Safety  Commission  keeps  track  of  snow  machine  and  four-wheeler 
accidents——

The  CHAIRMAN.  Most  of  these  machines  are  used  in  rural  areas, 
particularly  in  my  state.  And  of  the  230  rural  villages,  most  of 
them do not have hospitals. They have very small clinics staffed by 
community  health  aides.  Would  you  ask  the  Commission  to  con-
sider  expanding  the  accident  survey  program  to  cover  these  rural 
areas  by  contacting  the  entities  that  these  people  go  to  when  in-
jured? Hospitals are in major cities in my state. Clinics are in hun-
dreds  of  places.  And  I  do  not  think  you  are  getting  really  a  good 
sampling, a good survey, of accidents under the current procedure. 
I would urge you to ask the Commission to expand the concept, so 
that  you  ask  the  clinics  for  information,  as  well  as  hospitals.  Are 
you willing to do that? 

Ms.  NORD.  Sir,  I  strongly  believe  that  the  more  information  you 
have  about  products  and  accidents,  the  better  off  you  are  going  to 
understand  the  risks.  So  absolutely  I  would  be  happy  to  do  that. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  We  thank  you  very  much.  Senator  Inouye  and  I 
both  want  to  indicate  for  the  record  we  intend  to  recommend  that 
the  Committee  report  favorably  the  nominations  before  the  Com-
mittee now. And we look forward to working with you in your new 
capacity, as soon as you are confirmed. 

Thank you very much. 
Ms. NORD. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Mr. COBEY. Thank you, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you all. 
[Whereupon, at 11:53 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

APRIL 4, 2005

Dear Senators Stevens and Inouye:
This  letter  is  to  support  the  nomination  of  Nancy  A.  Nord  to  be  a  Commissioner 
of  the  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission.  I  request  that  it  be  made  part  of  the 
Committee’s hearing record. 

Nancy was born and raised in South Dakota and I have known her and her family 
for  many  years.  I  believe  that  she  would  bring  thoughtful  and  evenhanded  leader-
ship  to  the  Commission.  She  has  both  management  experience  and  substantive  ex-
pertise  on  issues  before  the  CPSC  and  would  make  a  valuable  contribution  to  the 
Commission. 

Nancy has my full support for this position. I hope that the Committee will move 

quickly to favorably report out this nomination.

Hon. Ted Stevens, 
Chairman, 
Hon. Daniel K. Inouye 
Co-Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, 
Washington, DC.
Dear Senators:
The purpose of this letter is to indicate our enthusiastic endorsement of Commis-
sioner  Joseph  H.  Boardman  of  New  York  for  the  position  of  Administrator  of  the 
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). 

Since  1997,  it  has  been  our  privilege  to  work  with  Commissioner  Boardman  as 
a  State  Department  of  Transportation  colleague  on  a  wide  range  of  transportation 
matters. The Commissioner has demonstrated extraordinary intelligence, leadership 
and  dedication  to  public  service  principles  through  his  chairmanship  of  the  Amer-
ican  Association  of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials’  Standing  Com-
mittee on Rail Transportation (SCORT). 

As Chairman of SCORT Commissioner Boardman coordinated rail policy develop-
ment  by  the  several  states  states.  These  policies  have  included  federal  legislation, 
intercity  passenger  rail  and  Amtrak,  development  of  Class  I,  II  and  III  railroads, 
freight rail and labor issues, safety, intermodalism, security and other matters. His 
grasp  of  these  issues  is  profound  yet  he  also  has  the  interpersonal  skills  to  listen 
to the views of others in order to achieve consensus. 

I  have  personally  observed  the  strengths  of  character  and  experience  in  Commis-
sioner  Boardman,  and  am  confident  that  he  will  serve  the  nation  well  as  Adminis-
trator of the FRA. Therefore I ask for your vote in consent of this confirmation. 

Sincerely, 

(47)

DAVID D. KING, 

Deputy Secretary for Transit. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN MCCAIN TO

DR. MICHAEL D. GRIFFIN 

Question  1.  Most  recently,  there  have  been  many  claims  by  government  and  in-
dustry  scientists  that  the  Administrations  is  ignoring  the  facts  concerning  climate 
change  science  and  has  been  filtering  some  of  the  data  that  makes  it  into  final  re-
ports. What are your thoughts on the state of climate change science? 

Answer.  I  think  that  the  President’s  Climate  Change  Research  Initiative  is  the 
right  approach—there  are  questions  that  we  can  answer  in  a  relatively  short 
amount of time that can directly inform the policy debate. My understanding is that, 
through  the  agencies  participating  in  the  Climate  Change  Science  Program,  we  are 
developing a suite of assessments to update our state of knowledge on some of those 
key climate questions. These assessments are supported by NASA observations and 
research, a responsibility I take very seriously.

Question  1a.  How  do  you  plan  to  deal  with  such  accusations  and  ensure  that  the 

research results are accurately represented in final reports? 

Answer.  NASA’s  role  is  to  produce  the  best  science  possible  to  inform  policy—not 
to make policy. As Administrator, I will work to ensure that only the highest quality 
science  is  accomplished,  and  that  all  research  results  which  have  been  technically 
reviewed  and  found  to  be  sound,  are  made  available.  The  scientific  process  man-
dates  that  data  and  analyses  be  disseminated  and  that  technical  review  and  chal-
lenges be conducted. This is the way science advances. NASA will not filter research 
for political expediency.

Question  2.  NASA  is  planning  to  return  the  Shuttle  to  flight  next  month.  The 
Committee  last  year  passed  a  NASA  authorization  bill  that  required  NASA  to  cer-
tify  to  the  Congress  that  the  safety  recommendations,  identified  as  ‘‘Return-to-
Flight’’ by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, have been satisfied before re-
turning to flight. Can you support such an action? 

Answer.  It  does  not  appear  to  be  technically  possible  to  satisfy  the  full  scope  of 
the  CAIB  recommendations  for  return  to  flight.  For  example,  the  CAIB  rec-
ommended NASA develop a comprehensive inspection and repair capability to cover 
the  widest  possible  range  of  damage  scenarios,  but  we  still  do  not  know  how  to  re-
pair  a  hole  in  a  wing  such  as  that  which  is  believed  to  have  been  responsible  for 
the loss of Columbia. Thus, my first efforts as I assume the leadership of NASA will 
be  to  understand  fully  what  can  be,  and  has  been,  done  to  assure  that  the  Shuttle 
will  fly,  for  the  remainder  of  its  service,  as  safely  as  the  technical  state  of  the  art 
permits.  If  I  find  the  Shuttle  to  be  unsafe,  I  will  not  give  the  go-ahead  for  it  to  fly 
until  all  necessary  corrective  actions  have  been  taken.  These  are  the  actions  that 
I can and will support.

Question  3.  In  a  recent  article  concerning  the  Space  Shuttle’s  return-to-flight, 
Commander  Eileen  Collins  and  other  crew  members  indicated  that  they  would  fly 
only if the Stafford-Covey Group and the agency’s leadership agreed that Columbia 
Accident  Investigation  Board’s  ‘‘Return-to-Flight’’  recommendations  have  been  met. 
The  Stafford-Covey  Group  recently  cancelled  a  meeting  to  discuss  NASA’s  work  on 
these recommendations because of a lack of information from NASA. Does this situ-
ation cause concern for you? 

Answer. This situation will be of concern to me if it has been accurately reported 
by  the  media,  a  matter  into  which  I  will  probe  at  my  first  opportunity.  If  NASA 
is withholding information necessary for analysis by the Stafford-Covey group, I will 
deal  swiftly  and  surely  with  that  situation.  If,  however,  the  information  is  unavail-
able  or  simply  not  yet  available,  this  would  be  a  matter  leading  to  a  different  out-
come. Summarizing, I will deal with the entire return-to-flight issue as immediately 
and thoroughly as possible after confirmation.

Question  4.  According  to  a  recent  General  Accountability  Office  report,  the  Space 
Shuttle  program  has  made  limited  progress  toward  developing  a  detailed  long-term 
strategy  for  sustaining  its  workforce  through  the  Space  Shuttle’s  retirement.  What 
are your plans for addressing workforce issues while also considering safety and the 
development of a replacement vehicle for the Shuttle system? 

Answer. I do not yet have such plans. After confirmation, I will develop a full un-
derstanding of the existing situation, and develop a strategy for the required work-
force transition. I will share this strategy with the Congress as it becomes available.
Question 5. You previously served as President and Chief Operating Officer of In-
Q-Tel,  a  CIA  supported  organization  that  invests  in  private  companies  to  ensure

49

greater  availability  of  intelligence-related  technologies  for  the  government.  Do  you 
think this approach or model is useful in other parts of the government? 

Answer.  Though  I  can  take  no  credit  for  the  invention  of  the  In-Q-Tel  model,  I 
believe it to be a thoroughly excellent approach for achieving ‘‘spin in’’ of the latest 
and  best  results  of  the  high-tech  community  into  government  agencies,  including 
NASA. I plan to support the furtherance of this model at NASA.

Question  6.  Will  NASA  perform  an  astronaut  servicing  mission  to  the  Hubble 
Space  Telescope,  as  recommended  by  the  recent  National  Academies  report  on  the 
‘‘Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope’’ ? 

Answer. I cannot say whether NASA will support such a mission without further 
review, after we have completed our initial return-to-flight mission, STS–114. Imme-
diately  after  this  is  accomplished,  I  will  commission  a  thorough,  impartial  review 
of  the  operational  and  financial  factors  involved  in  making  such  a  decision,  will 
bring  it  to  a  speedy  conclusion,  and  will  fully  share  the  results  of  this  review,  my 
decision, and the rationale for this decision, with the Congress.

Question  7.  How  will  cost  overruns  in  the  Shuttle  program  and  the  development 
of  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  be  kept  in  check?  Do  you  foresee  robotic  missions 
and  research  programs  in  the  Science  Mission  Directorate  shouldering  the  burden 
for overruns in the manned program, as has happened in recent months? 

Answer. I believe that NASA has the ability to improve its execution of the basic 
‘‘blocking  and  tackling’’  of  program  management.  I  will  make  this  a  major  effort 
after  confirmation;  there  is  no  reason  why  NASA  should  not  be  the  leader  in  the 
cost-effective  execution  of  government  aerospace  programs.  I  will  endeavor  to  avoid 
having  scientific  or  aeronautical  research  programs  ‘‘shoulder  the  burden’’  for  over-
runs in the manned spaceflight program.

Question  8.  What  do  you  see  as  the  role  of  science  in  NASA’s  Vision  for  Space 

Answer.  Science  is  one  of  the  fundamental  goals  of  the  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration.  Opportunities  to  perform  new  and  interesting  scientific  investigations,  in 
new  ways  and  at  new  destinations,  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  Vision  for  Space 
Exploration.  I  am  committed  to  the  preservation  of  a  robust  science  program  at 
NASA. 

Exploration? 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO

DR. MICHAEL D. GRIFFIN 

Question  1.  With  the  ongoing  war  on  terror  and  budget,  CAN  the  country  afford 

a new launch system to meet the Exploration vision in the near future? 

Answer. Yes, the country can afford a new launch system if one is needed to sup-
port  the  Vision  for  Exploration.  It  is  likely  that  any  new  launch  system  would  be 
based on existing components, which would probably cost less than the development 
of  an  entirely  new  vehicle.  The  President  is  not  seeking  major  increases  in  NASA 
funding;  rather,  the  Vision  sets  a  new  direction  for  the  use  of  funds  presently  allo-
cated for NASA’s human spaceflight program.

Question 2. What transition or gap roles do you see for the Michoud Assembly Fa-
cility? As the new NASA Administrator how will you ensure there will be sustained 
funding for Michoud between the Shuttle retirement and Exploration start up? 

Answer. It is likely that NASA will need a heavy-lift vehicle to support the vision 
for  space  exploration.  An  analysis  of  future  space  launch  requirements  is  called  for 
in the National Space Transportation Policy. The policy further calls for NASA and 
the  DoD  to  work  together  to  develop  a  roadmap  to  meet  these  requirements  and 
until  that  roadmap  is  complete,  it  is  not  clear  exactly  what  type  of  launch  vehicles 
will be used to support exploration. However, NASA cannot implement the develop-
ment  of  a  heavy-lift  launch  vehicle  without  the  skills,  tooling,  and  handling  equip-
ment  necessary  for  large  system  components.  Critical  facilities  and  skills  necessary 
for  these  capabilities  exist  at  Michoud.  Such  facilities  and  skills  at  Michoud  and 
elsewhere  in  the  program  will  be  identified  and  transition  plans  to  preserve  them 
will be developed.

Question  3.  Tell  us  your  thoughts  on  HLLV  and  SDV.  What  role  will  Michoud 

Answer.  Any  heavy-lift  launch  system  for  the  Vision  for  Exploration  will,  if  it  is 
to be efficient and cost effective, involve large components. The largest system com-
ponent  available  in  the  world  today  and  which  is  applicable  to  the  heavy-lift  re-
quirements  of  Exploration  is  the  Shuttle  External  Tank.  In  one  form  or  another,  I 
would  expect  the  fabrication  and  handling  facilities  and  the  skills  resident  at 
Michoud to be essential to the Exploration vision.

Question 4. How will NASA transition the human capital on STS/ISS to Space Ex-

ploration projects? 

Answer.  My  intention  is  to  define  the  architectural  elements  and  program  plans 
for the Vision for Exploration on a timetable that allows us to transition the human 
capital  with  the  requisite  skill  sets  from  the  Shuttle/ISS  programs  as  these  pro-
grams wind down.

Question 5. I have been watching the progress of NASA over the past year in mov-
ing  to  establish  a  centralized  Shared  Service  Center  for  administrative  processing 
for  the  Agency.  My  understanding  is  that  final  selection  of  a  site  for  the  NSSC  is 
imminent.  Are  you  prepared  to  move  ahead  promptly  with  this  cost-savings/one 
NASA  initiative?  How  will  you  ensure  that  your  final  selection  of  a  site  for  the 
NSSC provides the most savings of FTE and dollars for the Agency? 

Answer. It is my understanding that an impartial source selection board has stud-
ied this issue and is prepared to announce its final selection shortly. After a review 
of  the  concept  and  its  implications,  I  will  commit  to  implementing  this  cost-saving 
initiative. I will review the selection results before any announcement is made, and 
will ensure that the most globally beneficial solution has been chosen.

Question  6.  Establishing  and  staffing  a  new  center  to  execute  the  NSSC  appears 
contrary to the much publicized 2006 targeted reductions at some of the centers, are 
you  prepared  to  support  this  transformation?  (Distinction  between  Administrative 
jobs (NSSC) vs. aeronautical/exploration/engineering type jobs.) 

Answer. I will review the plans for this transformation to ensure that it truly de-
livers the expected cost-saving benefits and, if so, will support it. Reductions in ad-
ministrative  positions  at  individual  Centers  will  be  tolerable  if  they  help  NASA 
achieve greater overall efficiency.

Question 1. There is a possibility that Stafford-Covey may decide that one or more 
of the Return to Flight Recommendations have not been completed to their satisfac-
tion. What action will you take if this scenario occurs? 

Answer. In such a case, I will examine the issue to determine whether the NASA 
shuttle  program  managers  agree,  or  differ,  with  the  Stafford-Covey  assessment.  If 
they  do  differ,  I  will  determine  whether  it  is  believed  that  there  is  any  possibility 
of  meeting  the  intent  of  the  recommendation(s)  within  the  limits  of  existing  tech-
nology and the available financial means. If the problem cannot be solved, or cannot 
be  solved  within  a  budget  and  timeframe  which  is  useful  to  the  continued  support 
of  the  ISS,  it  will  be  necessary  to  make  a  determination  as  to  whether  or  not  to 
accept  the  risk  of  flying  with  the  known  deficiency,  relative  to  the  CAIB  rec-
ommendations.  This  will  be  done  in  a  full  and  open  manner,  with  all  stakeholders 
involved.

at NASA? 

Question  2.  What  qualities  will  you  look  for  in  potential  Senior  Level  Managers 

Answer. Potential senior managers at NASA must have unimpeachable integrity, 
high  intelligence,  appropriate  experience  with  operational  space  programs,  prior 
senior  management  experience,  excellent  ‘‘people  skills,’’  high  energy,  total  commit-
ment, and a proven ability to ‘‘get things done’’ in the real world.

Question 3. Can you provide assurances that NASA will do what it can, as a mat-
ter of priority, to assure that crew survivability in a wide range of scenarios is con-
sidered, and implemented to the extent feasible, during the design and development 
of the next generation NASA Human Space Vehicle? 

Answer. No issue is more important to me than to assure that the fullest possible 
range  of  crew  survivability  options  is  considered  in  the  next  generation  of  manned 
space vehicle design.

Question 4. NASA is hoping to embark on an ambitious journey into Space using 
a  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle.  America  is  well  aware  of  NASA’s  history  of  cost  over-
runs.  So,  it  is  especially  crucial,  that  NASA  make  marked  improvements  over  pre-
vious  programs  in  the  area  of  cost  estimation  and  life  cycle  costing.  Do  you  have 
some ideas on how NASA can improve in this area? 

Answer.  It  is  my  opinion  that  the  discrepancy  between  predictions  and  achieve-
ments in regard to the cost estimation of aerospace programs generally, whether ex-
ecuted on behalf of DoD or NASA, is more a matter of improper program execution 
than it is a matter of incorrect estimation. We have only to consider the commercial 
communications  satellite  sector  to  realize  that  it  is  quite  possible,  when  profits  are 
at stake, for aerospace companies to produce complex yet reliable spacecraft on time

and  on  budget.  The  establishment  of  greater  discipline  in  program  management 
within  government-sponsored  space  programs  will  be  the  more  fruitful  path  for  us 
to pursue. Improved cost estimating techniques are certainly desirable, but more ac-
curate estimates of unacceptable results is hardly the result we need.

Question  5.  Do  you  have  any  comments  about  the  importance  of  lessons  learned 

for NASA’s future? 

Answer.  I  prefer  to  think  of  these  as  ‘‘lessons  applied’’  rather  than  ‘‘lessons 
learned,’’  as  only  the  application  of  a  ‘‘lesson  learned’’  will  really  yield  a  different 
outcome. Such lessons are the only means by which we add to the accumulated body 
of knowledge, both art and science, that is required for the United States to be the 
preeminent  spacefaring  nation.  Nothing  is  more  important  for  NASA’s  future  than 
effectively incorporating such knowledge.

Question  6.  Are  you  familiar  with  the  Plasma  Rocket?  Once  you  have  been  con-
firmed, will you look into it as an option for the next generation human rated space-
craft, and for other applications? 

Answer.  I  am  familiar  with  the  plasma  rocket  in  general  terms,  and  consider  it 
to be an excellent possible option for use in helping to implement the Vision for Ex-
ploration.  It  is  likely,  however,  that  the  most  effective  use  of  the  plasma  rocket  in 
the future will be in the shipment of cargo, rather than on crewed vehicles.

Question  7.  The  same  logic  applies  that  NASA  is  using  for  Space  Shuttle  mis-
sions—if the ‘‘Crew Exploration Vehicle’’ has a problem, the ability to dock with the 
space station could be a life saver. What will you do to assure that the next genera-
tion human rated spacecraft can dock with the Space Station? 

Answer.  The  primary  purpose  of  the  CEV  is  to  support  exploration,  an  objective 
I  fully  support.  The  recent  Request  for  Proposal  (RFP)  released  by  NASA  does  not 
require the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) to go to the International Space Station 
(ISS).  Rather  it  is  a  capability  that  the  contractors  are  asked  to  assess.  The  final 
requirements  for  the  CEV  are  planned  to  be  established  next  year  during  the  Sys-
tems  Requirements  Review  and  will  be  informed  by  the  analyses  and  trades  made 
by  the  contractor  teams.  I  plan  to  work  with  the  Exploration  Directorate  to  under-
stand  the  rationale  for  this  capability  being  optional  and  see  whether  this  ‘‘option’’ 
should be made a ‘‘requirement.’’

Question 8. Would you like to comment on orbital debris and its danger to human 

Answer.  This  is  a  topic  with  which  I  have  had  to  become  conversant  with  in  re-
cent  years,  and  which  is  treated  in  some  detail  in  my  textbook,  Space  Vehicle  De-
sign. Briefly, we are now aware that space debris, even that consisting of very small 
particles (e.g., 1 millimeter in size) can be very damaging, even fatal, to space vehi-
cles  of  any  kind,  manned  or  unmanned.  The  generation  of  orbital  debris  must  be 
strictly  controlled.  Numerous  internationally  accepted  guidelines  for  space  oper-
ations to minimize debris generation exist, and I believe these guidelines should be 
followed by the United States and all spacefaring nations.

Question  1.  As  you  know,  Louisiana  has  experienced  four  train  car  collisions  ear-
lier this year. How has the Federal Railroad Administration responded to these col-
lisions? 

Answer.  I  am  aware  of  your  unfortunate  experience.  I  understand  that  the  FRA 
is  working  with  the  State  of  Louisiana  to  develop  a  State  Action  Plan  focusing  on 
crossing  safety.  If  confirmed,  I  will  make  every  effort  to  foster  cooperation  between 
the FRA and the State to ensure the safety of Louisiana’s citizens.

Question 2. Louisiana on average per year has received $3.2 million from the Fed-
eral STP Railroad Hazardous Elimination Fund since 1987. Each year the Louisiana 
Department of Transportation and Development spends an additional $7 million on 
railroad safety. Why has the federal portion stayed the same for 18 years? 

Answer.  I  do  not  currently  know  the  answer.  If  confirmed,  I  will  examine  this 

issue and follow up with you.

Question  3.  I  understand  Secretary  Mineta  will  retransmit  the  Bush  Administra-
tion’s rail safety reauthorization bill in the near future. How will this proposed piece 
of  legislation  address  the  recent  automobile  train  collisions  that  have  occurred  in 
Louisiana? 

Answer.  I  understand  the  Administration’s  rail  safety  bill  is  in  the  process  of 
being drafted, and it would be inappropriate to comment on it prior to introduction.

However,  if  confirmed,  I  pledge  to  work  with  you  to  ensure  that  Louisiana’s  recent 
crossing accidents are considered in the drafting process.

Question  4.  Louisiana  has  3,000  miles  of  railroad  tracks  and  6,017  rail  crossings: 
3,017  public  crossings  and  3,000  on  private  property.  As  the  new  Federal  Railroad 
Administrator  how  will  you  assist  states  who  would  like  to  consolidate  and/or  close 
railroad  crossings?  There  is  very  strong  opposition  from  local  communities  about 
closing  railroad  crossings.  Will  the  Federal  Railroad  Administration  work  with 
states to provide incentives to the states/local communities regarding railroad cross-
ing closures? 

Answer.  I  know  that  the  FRA  has  been  a  strong  advocate  for  closing  highway-
rail crossings. FRA headquarters and field staff will work with states to explore the 
options and explain to communities the benefits from closing crossings. In addition, 
Section  130  program  funds  are  available—up  to  $7,500—for  each  crossing  closed  if 
matched by the railroad that maintains the highway-rail crossing to be closed. Since 
having  fewer  crossings  is  in  the  interest  of  railroads,  they  will  often  provide  much 
more  than  $7,500  to  assist  communities  in  the  closing  of  a  highway-rail  crossing. 
If  confirmed,  I  will  ensure  that  FRA  staff  is  made  available  to  help  advise  commu-
nities of their options. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BYRON L. DORGAN TO

JOSEPH H. BOARDMAN 

Mr.  Boardman,  in  my  state  of  North  Dakota,  the  community  of  Fargo/Moorhead 
has  been  working  with  Burlington  Northern  Santa  Fe  Railroad  (BNSF)  to  imple-
ment  a  quiet  zone  so  that  BNSF  will  stop  blowing  its  horn  when  its  trains  go 
through  town,  while  insuring  the  safety  of  the  citizens  and  rail  travelers.  The  com-
munities have, and continue to expend significant funds and time to have this quiet 
zone go into effect, and the delays by the FRA stand to jeopardize these efforts. 

Question  1.  The  Swift  Rail  Development  Act  of  1994  contemplated  a  rule-making 
process  for  quiet  zones  to  be  completed  years  ago.  Every  supplementary  safety 
measure  (SSM)  is  believed  to  reduce  the  possibility  of  accidents  at  grade  crossings 
substantially—some  by  as  much  as  two-thirds.  It  can  be  argued  that  the  delay  in 
the  adoption  of  a  final  rule  could  cost  lives.  Are  you  committed  to  the  adoption  of 
a final rule as quickly as possible? 

Answer.  I  am  happy  to  report  that  the  Department  of  Transportation  issued  the 
Final  Rule  on  the  Use  of  Locomotive  Horns  at  Rail-Grade  Crossings  on  April  22, 
2005.

Question 2. On April 12, 2005, I introduced the Welded Rail and Tank Car Safety 
Improvement  Act  with  my  colleague  Senator  Kay  Bailey  Hutchinson,  to  direct  the 
FRA  to  implement  the  track  and  tank  car  safety  measures  recommended  by  the 
NTSB  after  a  terrible  derailment  that  took  place  in  Minot,  ND  in  2001.  If  you  are 
confirmed  to  the  Federal  Railroad  Administration  will  you  commit  to  move  ahead 
with implementing the recommendations with utmost expediency? 

Answer.  I  understand  that  the  FRA  is  actively  working  to  address  the  rec-
ommendations  made  by  the  NTSB  in  the  wake  of  the  Minot  derailment.  If  con-
firmed, I will ensure that this effort is given high priority.

Question 3. Do you feel that FRA has all of the resources it needs to operate? Does 

the FRA need more inspectors in order to effectively carry out its duties? 

Answer. I believe that the FRA’s budget is adequate and reflects its current level 
of responsibility. If confirmed, I will engage in an evaluation of how FRA resources 
are  used,  and  how  they  might  be  used  in  the  future.  I  will  also  look  at  how  risk 
is  measured  now,  and  how  we  might  do  that  job  differently  so  that  we  can  target 
our resources to improve rail safety.

Question 4. I understand that you have experienced several serious grade crossing 
accidents  and  other  safety  incidents  in  New  York  State  over  the  past  2  years.  As 
Commissioner,  please  describe  your  experiences  in  dealing  with  the  FRA.  Did  you 
feel  that  the  FRA  had  all  the  resources  it  needed  to  effectively  achieve  its  mission 
in regard to those instances? 

Answer.  During  my  time  as  Commissioner,  the  New  York  State  Department  of 
Transportation (NYSDOT) and the FRA have been partners under the Federal Rail-
road Safety Program for State Participation Agreement. This partnership existed be-
fore  my  time  as  Commissioner.  Under  this  agreement,  FRA  conducts  inspections 
and investigations in concert with NYSDOT. FRA’s participation with us helps both 
agencies maximize our resources, and our partnership works well. The grade cross-
ing  accidents  and  other  safety  incidents  that  occurred  in  New  York  in  the  past  2

JOSEPH H. BOARDMAN 

Question 1. What is your opinion of the Administration’s calls for Amtrak’s bank-
ruptcy?  Do  you  believe  that  bankruptcy  is  a  prudent  or  feasible  way  to  restructure 
Amtrak? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  Secretary  Mineta  has  stated  that  the  President’s  budget 
is  a  ‘‘call  to  action.’’  I  understand  that  the  budget  raises  the  possibility  of  bank-
ruptcy as a consequence of a failure to enact meaningful reform. 

I am firmly committed to enhancing intercity passenger rail in the United States. 
If  confirmed  I  will  work  with  this  and  other  congressional  committees,  states,  and 
stakeholders to find a reasonable solution for reforming passenger rail service in the 
United States.

Question  2.  Many  have  characterized  the  Federal  Railroad  Administration  (FRA) 
as  an  agency  ‘‘adrift’’  because  of  a  series  of  senior-level  management  changes  over 
the past year. What will you do as Administrator to help focus and reinvigorate the 
FRA? 

Answer.  I  have  never  led  an  organization  that  did  not  contain  good  people,  good 
ideas, and the seeds for excellence. This means that I will first look within the FRA 
for  the  answer.  Starting  from  the  inside,  I  will  encourage  necessary  developmental 
activities and training. I will not forget that I will be held accountable by the Presi-
dent  and  Congress  for  a  clear  direction  for  the  FRA,  and  if  confirmed,  I  will  accept 
that accountability.

Question 3. What will your top priorities be as FRA Administrator? 
Answer.  If  confirmed,  I  will  focus  my  efforts  first  and  foremost  on  safety.  I  am 
also  committed  to  reforming  the  nation’s  intercity  passenger  rail  service.  Finally,  I 
believe it is imperative to properly develop staff within the FRA.

nancing and development of rail infrastructure and service?

JOSEPH H. BOARDMAN 

Question  1.  What  do  you  perceive  as  the  railroad  industry’s  biggest  safety  prob-

Answer. I believe that, because of several recent high-profile accidents, the public 
is  beginning  lose  confidence  in  the  railroad  industry’s  safety  record.  The  industry 
must demonstrate that they are willing to exceed safety expectations, not just meet 
the minimums. Safety must be treated as the most important issue to every railroad 
company, without as much as a hint of complacent behavior.

Question  2.  Do  you  feel  that  security  is  adequately  provided  for  in  today’s  rail-

roading environment? 

Answer.  I  do  not  have  that  answer  at  this  time.  If  confirmed,  I  will  partner  with 
the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administra-
tion to secure our railroad environment.

Question 3. As Commissioner of Transportation for the State of New York, do you 
agree  with  the  Administration’s  plan  for  Amtrak,  as  it  wants  to  place  most  of  the 
responsibility for passenger rail funding with states? 

Answer. My experience as Commissioner of Transportation has convinced me that 
intercity  passenger  rail  is  critically  important  to  both  New  York  State  and  the 
Northeast region of the United States. In the Northeast, states already play a large 
role  in  intercity  passenger  rail.  We  have  at  least  eight  northeastern  non-Amtrak 
passenger rail providers, and each operates cooperatively. However, even though the 
provider  cooperation  belies  a  ‘‘system’’  for  all  intents  and  purposes,  they  each  con-
sider themselves to be independent operators. Based upon this experience, I believe 
it  is  possible  for  states  to  come  together  to  develop  an  intercity  rail  system.  At  the 
same  time,  the  Federal  Government  must  play  a  significant  role  in  state-based 
intercity passenger rail.

Question 4. You stated in your preface to AASHTO’s Standing Committee on Rail 
Transportation  Intercity  Passenger  Rail  Transportation  report  that  ‘‘rail  passenger 
service  provides  much  needed  capacity  and  redundancy  to  the  transportation  sys-

54

tem.’’ Given the events on September 11, 2001, and the possibility of future terrorist 
acts in the United States, do you feel that passenger rail service is a necessary com-
ponent of our national transportation system? 

Answer. Yes.
Question  5.  As  Commissioner  of  Transportation  in  New  York,  did  you  interact 
with  passengers  who  used  Amtrak  on  September  11,  2001,  and  the  week  following, 
when  aviation  was  entirely  shut  down?  If  so  do  you  feel  their  reliance  on  Amtrak, 
even if it was the only time they rode Amtrak, justifies such service? 

Answer.  I  have  had  interaction  with  passengers  who  used  Amtrak  as  a  result  of 
the  attack  on  9/11/01.  I  believe  that  there  is  clear  emotional  support  by  those  who 
used passenger rail to complete their trips during the aftermath of the terrorist at-
tack  on  New  York.  I  think  having  intercity  passenger  service  available  as  a  redun-
dant  mode  for  use  is  certainly  a  factor  to  be  evaluated  in  support  of  intercity  pas-
senger rail, but I do not believe that it is the sole or primary factor.

Question  6.  The  Administration  is  proposing  a  massive  shift  of  funding  responsi-
bility  from  the  Federal  Government  to  the  states.  As  Chair  of  AASHTO’s  Standing 
Committee  on  Rail  Transportation,  do  you  agree  with  the  Administration’s  plan  for 
Amtrak? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  reform  is  needed.  Stable  intercity  passenger  rail  is  impor-
tant to the states. The states believe that it is time to resolve future funding assist-
ance for all modes of transportation, including rail passenger service. AASHTO has 
called for the enactment of long-term legislation assuring that the nation’s travelers 
will have efficient and dependable intercity passenger rail service.

Question  7.  If  Amtrak  does  not  continue  to  operate  as  a  railroad,  as  proposed  in 
the  Administration’s  reform  proposal,  what  effect  do  you  feel  there  will  be  on  the 
safety of Amtrak’s rail operation and coordination between infrastructure? 

Answer. Infrastructure safety must be provided for under any model, and the Fed-
eral  Government  will  maintain  a  strong  hand  to  ensure  that  safety  is  the  first  pri-
ority. I believe that any intercity passenger rail reform will require that the Federal 
Government  bring  infrastructure  up  to  a  standard  of  good  repair  (SOGR)  for  those 
assets  under  its  control  and  accountability.  The  states  should  have  a  stake  in  any 
SOGR decision.

Question  8.  Are  you  familiar  with  Great  Britain’s  experience  in  separating  infra-
structure  management  responsibilities  with  operating  responsibilities  on  a  massive 
scale?  Given  the  safety  implications  of  that  experience,  do  you  feel  it  was  a  wise 
move?  Do  you  feel  such  a  move  is  wise  for  the  Northeast  Corridor  management  re-
sponsibilities? 

Answer. My understanding is that Great Britain’s experience with separating rail 
infrastructure  management  responsibilities  from  rail  operations  involved  dividing 
passenger  services  into  25  operating  units,  and  infrastructure  maintenance  into 
seven  maintenance  companies  and  six  track  renewal  companies.  The  British  ap-
proach  was  far  too  complex.  We  have  learned  a  great  deal  from  Britain’s  experi-
ences. Thus, I don’t think anyone envisions the U.K.’s controversial approach being 
applied  to  the  NEC.  Rather,  separation  of  infrastructure  from  operations  on  the 
NEC could emphasize clarity of responsibility, built-in incentives that support rath-
er  than  undermine  the  underlying  goal  of  cost-effective  public  transportation,  and 
transparency  of  costs  and  their  allocation.  This  approach  could  enable  each  entity 
to focus more clearly on its specific goal and responsibility.

Question 9. Amtrak is the only carrier that runs the length of the Northeast Cor-
ridor,  and  therefore  is  the  only  entity  with  an  interest  in  ensuring  infrastructure 
standards  are  constructed  and  maintained  on  a  level  of  safety  and  engineering  to 
support  high-speed  rail  service.  In  fact,  on  many  segments,  Amtrak  runs  the  only 
passenger  rails.  Given  these  facts  and  the  myriad  regional  interests  of  the  com-
muter  rail  users  of  the  Northeast  Corridor,  do  you  believe  that  the  Northeast  Cor-
ridor can be equitably run with the leadership of Amtrak? 

Answer.  Integral  to  any  restructuring  solution  for  the  Northeast  Corridor  would 
be effective coordinating mechanisms for such joint tasks as scheduling, dispatching, 
accounting,  and  engineering.  I  believe  that  the  states  would  have  a  strong  interest 
in  making  sure  these  coordinating  mechanisms  are  efficient  and  effective,  and  that 
the  intercity  operations  maintain  their  relatively  high  quality  of  service,  thereby 
making  the  highest  possible  contribution  to  the  bottom  line  of  the  whole  operation. 
Accordingly, there is every reason to expect that a new, intelligently-designed struc-
ture would be capable of managing the Northeast Corridor equitably.
