III. Background

4

An  increase  in  hurricane  activity  in  recent  years  has  brought  to  the  Nation’s  at-
tention  our  growing  vulnerability  to  natural  disasters.  The  devastation  and  far-
reaching impact of recent hurricanes have demonstrated the urgent need for an im-
proved  understanding  of  hurricanes  and  the  ways  in  which  we  can  better  prepare
so  as  to  minimize  loss  of  life  and  destruction  of  property.  The  economic  losses  from
hurricanes  are  staggering.  It  is  estimated  that  hurricane-related  losses  averaged
more that ten billion dollars annually from 1990 to 1995, and upwards of $35 billion
a  year  from  2000  to  2006.1 These  numbers  would  most  likely  escalate  in  coming
years as our economy grows and more investments are expected to be made in coast-
al  infrastructure.  While  billions  of  tax  dollars  are  spent  on  rescue  and  relief  efforts
after  a  hurricane  strikes,  the  Federal  Government  invests  relatively  little  in  the
science  and  engineering  research  that  could  prevent  much  of  the  destruction  and
greatly  minimize  losses.  The  National  Science  Board  (NSB)  estimates  that  federal
fiscal year budget investments for science and engineering research related to hurri-
canes  totaled  around  $200  million  dollars  in  fiscal  year  2006.2 When  attempting  to
assess  federal  dollars  going  to  hurricane  research  at  the  time,  the  NSB  found  the
exact numbers difficult to pinpoint, indicating a potential lack of focus and coordina-
tion among agencies. Even so, the most optimistic of estimates suggest that our cur-
rent  funding  levels  are  inadequate  to  address  our  increasing  vulnerability  to  hurri-
canes.

In  December  of  2005,  the  National  Science  Board3 established  the  Task  Force  on
Hurricane  Science  and  Engineering  in  an  effort  to  assess  and  improve  our  nation’s
ability to predict, mitigate, and better respond to hurricanes. The task force set out
to evaluate and make recommendations for ways to improve the Nation’s hurricane-
related research activities. In January, 2007, the Task Force released the results of
its  year  long  assessment,  a  report  entitled,  ‘‘Hurricane  Warning:  The  Critical  Need
for  a  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative.’’  The  report  concluded  that  ‘‘the  U.S.
must  engage  in  a  nationally  coordinated,  multi-agency  and  multi-disciplinary  re-
search  initiative  to  greatly  expand  our  understanding  of  hurricanes  and  identify
more effective strategies for dealing with them.’’ 4 The report outlined the structure
and budget necessary to implement such an initiative.

The  report  concluded  that  the  United  States  is  becoming  increasingly  vulnerable
to  hurricanes,  while  our  coastal  areas  are  becoming  more  and  more  heavily  popu-
lated. A National Academies Study found that half of the U.S. populations live with
in 50 miles of coastline.5 Furthermore, taking into consideration the interconnected-
ness  of  our  economy,  hurricane  devastation  affects  more  than  just  the  community
hit.  The  effects  are  felt  throughout  the  Nation  through  increased  fuel  prices,  dis-
placed citizens, and much more.

National Hurricane Research Initiative, H.R. 2407

The  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative  (NHRI)  takes  the  recommendations
from  the  National  Science  Board  report  to  create  a  multi-agency  effort  focused  on
improving  our  ability  to  predict  hurricanes  and  their  intensity,  and  on  mitigating
the devastating affects on coastal populations. This NHRI would engage all relevant
federal agencies, industry, academia, and local government to strengthen hurricane
research through an integrated and highly focused framework, promoting multi-dis-
ciplinary, multi-agency involvement. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
istration (NOAA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are designated as the
two leading agencies responsible for implementation and oversight of the Initiative.
The  NSB  report  outlines  four  investment  categories  that  are  reflected  in  the  bill

language of H.R. 2407:

1. Understanding and Prediction: Research will be directed to more quickly and
accurately  predict  hurricane  intensification,  size,  and  location  of  landfall.
Also,  research  is  needed  to  understand  and  model  storm  surge,  rainfall  and
flooding  from  hurricanes.  Research  will  be  focused  on  improving  hurricane

3 The National Science Board, comprised of twenty-four members appointed by the President,
is  the  governing  body  of  the  National  Science  Foundation,  and  serves  as  an  independent  body
of advisors to the President and Congress on national science and engineering research and edu-
cation policy issues.

storm  observation  technology  through  GPS  technology,  unmanned  aerial  ve-
hicles, mobile radars, etc.

2. Impacts: Research will focus on the interaction of hurricanes with engineered
structures,  so  coastal  infrastructure  can  be  better  assessed  for  vulnerability
to  hurricanes.  Research  will  be  directed  at  better  understanding  the  eco-
nomic  and  social  impacts  of  hurricanes,  so  we  can  identify  impediments  to
implementing  research  outcomes.  Also,  fundamental  research  is  needed  to
understand  the  relationship  between  hurricanes  and  climate  and  natural
ecosystems.

3. Preparedness and response measures: Research will be directed towards im-
plementing  a  national  engineering  assessment  of  coastal  infrastructure  to
identify the levees, bridges, and other infrastructure that may be particularly
vulnerable  to  hurricanes.  Studies  are  needed  to  develop  the  most  cost-effec-
tive  improvements  that  can  be  made  to  already  built  infrastructure.  Re-
search will focus on improved technologies for disaster response and recovery
as well as the complex challenge of evacuation and risk planning.

4. Cross-cutting activities: Research is needed to learn how to better utilize the
next  generation  of  petascale  computers  in  hurricane  research  and  modeling.
Research  will  also  be  directed  towards  incorporating  hurricane  impacts  and
related engineering principles in to training and education programs.

H.R. 2407 also calls for the establishment of a National Infrastructure Data Base
(NIDB)  and  The  National  Hurricane  Research  Test  Bed  (NHRTB).  The  NIDB  will
be  a  comprehensive  database  serving  as  a  baseline  to  develop  measurement  stand-
ards  that  will  aid  the  research  community’s  ability  to  measure  hurricane  impacts
and  make  effective  recommendations  for  improved  urban  planning  and  building
codes. In addition, the bill calls for the establishment of the NHRTB, which will be
an interdisciplinary laboratory focused primarily on the transfer of research knowl-
edge  to  operational  applications.  It  will  link  models  from  a  variety  of  related  fields
and  conduct  experimental  integrative  research.  The  NHRI  is  a  model  for  a  coordi-
nated  system  to  encourage  interaction  and  collaboration  for  the  purposes  of  a  com-
prehensive hurricane research effort.

Current Federal Hurricane Research

While  private  companies  are  also  making  important  advances  in  hurricane  re-
search,  NOAA  and  NSF  are  the  leaders  in  the  federal  hurricane  research  efforts.
The  National  Science  Foundation  invested  an  estimated  $13.5  million  dollars  in
fiscal  year  2006  in  a  variety  of  hurricane-related  research.6 NSF  awards  research
grants  to  carry  out  research  in  a  variety  of  areas  that  seek  to  improve  our  funda-
mental  understanding  of  hurricanes.  NSF  currently  invests  in  research  in  each  of
the  ten  research  areas  designated  in  the  bill  language:  Predicting  hurricane  inten-
sity  change;  understanding  ocean-atmosphere  interactions;  predicting  storm  surge,
rainfall,  inland  flooding,  and  strong  winds  produced  by  hurricanes  and  tropical
storms  during  and  after  landfall;  improved  observations  of  hurricanes  and  tropical
storms;  assessing  vulnerable  infrastructure;  interaction  of  hurricanes  with  engi-
neered  structures;  relationship  between  hurricanes,  climate,  and  natural  eco-
systems;  technologies  for  disaster  response  and  recovery;  evacuation  planning;  and
computational capability.

In  response  to  the  recommendations  made  by  the  NSB  report  as  well  as  others,
NOAA  established  the  Hurricane  Forecasting  Improvement  Project  (HFIP)  in  order
to accelerate improvements in forecasting the tracking of hurricanes, modeling capa-
bilities, and intensity to increase confidence to enhance mitigation and preparedness
decisions. Within the HFIP, NOAA seeks to embrace strong collaboration with non-
NOAA partners with the objective to transition research into operations.

The April 2008 draft plan, Proposed Framework for Addressing the National Hur-
ricane  Research  and  Forecast  Improvement  Initiatives:  NOAA’s  Hurricane  Forecast
Improvement  Project,7 provides  the  basis  for  NOAA  and  other  agencies  to  work  to-
ward  a  national  effort  to  coordinate  national  hurricane  research  and  align  not  only
other  agencies,  but  the  scientific  communities’  efforts  in  addressing  the  challenges
posed to improve hurricane forecasts. The main goals of the HFIP are to:

• Improve the accuracy and reliability of hurricane forecasts;
• Extend lead time for hurricane forecasts with increased certainty; and

These efforts will require major investments in enhanced observational strategies,
improved data assimilation, numerical modeling systems, and expanded forecast ap-
plications  based  on  the  high  resolution  and  ensemble  based  numerical  prediction

to address those with significant potential.
• Improve data assimilation to fully exploit all in situ and remotely sensed data
• Improve  numerical  and  other  models  for  operational  use  to  reduce  error  in
track and intensity guidance, quantify uncertainty in these forecasts, and ex-
tend  the  timeframe  for  useful  predictions  related  to  hurricane  development,
evolution, and decay; build in the capacity to represent the physical processes
responsible for rapid intensity change.
• Expand and enhance forecast tools and applications to add value to the model
guidance  and  direct  use  of  observations  by  the  forecasters  and  diverse  user
community.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Hearing  will  come  to  order,  and  I  wish  ev-
eryone  a  good  morning  and  welcome  you  to  today’s  joint  Sub-
committee  Hearing  on  The  State  of  Hurricane  Research  and  H.R.
2407, the National Hurricane Research Initiative Act.

We all know the devastation that a hurricane can cause and the
billions  of  taxpayers’  dollars  needed  to  recover  after  one  of  these
natural  disasters  occurs.  The  effects  of  Hurricane  Katrina  are  still
very  visible  in  many  of  our  districts,  including  mine.  In  my  mind
I can think back to my first most severe storm back in 1963, where
I  saw  the  largest  number  of  houses  in  the  middle  of  the  streets,
and  it  was  pretty—those  are  things  that  I  don’t  think  ever  go  out
of your mind if you witness them or live them.

It goes without saying that there is a need for research to do bet-
ter, to better understand hurricanes so that we can continue to im-
prove  our  forecasting  and  warning  capabilities  to  save  lives  and  to
make our communities more resistant to hurricanes to reduce prop-
erty damage.

And  as  we  will  hear  from  our  witnesses  today,  both  NOAA’s  in-
house  research  and  university  research  programs  are  making  im-
portant  advances  in  our  knowledge  of  hurricanes  and  there  is  a
need for a national effort to address the challenges posed by hurri-
cane forecasting.

H.R.  2407  was  introduced  by  our  colleague  from  Florida,  Mr.
Hastings, who is here with us today, along with one of the original
co-sponsors, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. We thank you both for your leader-
ship on this important issue.

We  also  have  a  distinguished  panel  of  experts  here  with  us
today, and I look forward to your testimony and your recommenda-
tions of what the Federal Government can do to improve hurricane
preparedness and to improve forecasting of hurricane direction and
intensity.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Lampson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

Good morning and welcome to today’s joint subcommittee hearing on the State of
the  Nation’s  Hurricane  Research  and  H.R.  2407,  the  National  Hurricane  Research
Initiative Act.

We  all  know  the  devastation  that  a  hurricane  can  cause,  and  the  billions  of  tax
payer’s dollars needed to recover after one of these natural disasters. The effects of
Hurricane Katrina are still very visible in many of our districts, including mine.

It goes without saying that there is a need for research to better understand hur-
ricanes so that we can continue to improve our forecasting and warning capabilities
to  save  lives  and  to  make  our  communities  more  resistant  to  hurricanes  to  reduce
property damage.

As  we  will  hear  from  our  witnesses  today,  both  NOAA’s  in-house  research  and
university  research  programs  are  making  important  advances  in  our  knowledge  of
hurricanes,  and  that  there  is  a  need  for  a  national  effort  to  address  the  challenges
posed by hurricane forecasting.

H.R.  2407,  was  introduced  by  our  colleague  from  Florida,  Mr.  Hastings,  who  is
here  with  us  today,  along  with  one  of  the  original  co-sponsors,  Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen.
We thank you both for your leadership on this important issue.

We  also  have  a  distinguished  panel  of  experts  here  with  us  today.  I  look  forward
your testimony and your recommendations of what the Federal Government can do
to improve hurricane preparedness and to improve forecasting of hurricane direction
and intensity.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  At  this  time  I  want  to  yield  to  my  distin-
guished colleague from South Carolina, our Ranking Member of the
Energy and Environment Subcommittee, Mr. Inglis, for an opening

statement,  and  afterwards  we  will  have  the  opening  statements  of
Chairman  Baird  and  Ranking  Member  Ehlers  of  the  Research  and
Science Education Subcommittee.

Mr. Inglis.
Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you  for  holding

this hearing.

South  Carolina,  as  you  know,  is  no  stranger  to  hurricanes.  I  re-
member  September,  1989,  when  Hurricane  Hugo  hit  the  south-
eastern  coastline,  causing  a  total  of  $10  billion,  billion  with  a  B,
dollars in damage, taking 82 lives and leaving 56,000 people home-
less.  It  was  the  most  damaging  hurricane  ever  recorded,  and  since
then  it  has  only  been  surpassed  by  Hurricanes  Andrew  and
Katrina.

In  the  aftermath  of  Hugo,  Andrew,  and  Katrina,  news  stories
and government officials emphasized that better preparations could
have  helped  save  lives  and  minimize  damage.  A  year  and  a  half
later, a year and a half after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina,
the  National  Science  Board  issued  their  2007  report,  Hurricane
Warning: The Critical Need for a National Hurricane Research Ini-
tiative,  highlighting  that  while  billions  were  being  spent  in  rescue
and  relief  efforts,  there  was  a  serious  lack  of  federal  dollars  being
invested in hurricane preparedness research.

Today we’ll discuss a bill that is based on that NSB report. H.R.
2407,  the  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative,  directs  the  gov-
ernment to make much more significant investments in hurricane-
related research across several agencies, including NOAA and NSF.
This  initiative  outlines  key  investment  categories  including  under-
standing and prediction, impacts, preparedness, and response.

H.R. 2407 authorizes a large sum of money for this research pro-
gram, 4.17 billion over 10 years. We have an obligation to consider
how  we  can  best  prepare  for  hurricanes,  but  given  our  limited  re-
sources,  we  also  need  to  carefully  consider  how  best  to  allocate
those  scarce  resources.  I  will  be  looking  forward  to  hearing  from
our witnesses about what they foresee to be the monetary and non-
monetary return on this proposed federal investment.

And,  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  may,  I  would  also  like  to  recognize  my
senior  legislative  assistant,  Phillip  Van  Steenburgh,  who  will  be
leaving me Monday, after two and one-half years to go to an intern-
ship at Capitol Hill Baptist Church and perhaps then to seminary.
So  we  wish  him  well,  although  we  are  going  to  miss  him  here  at
the Science Committee and on my staff.

So  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  holding  the  hearing,  and

thank you for the opportunity to hear from our witnesses.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Inglis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Thank you for holding this hearing, Mr. Chairman.
South  Carolina  is  no  stranger  to  hurricanes.  I  still  remember  September  1989,
when  Hurricane  Hugo  hit  the  southeastern  coastline,  causing  a  total  of  $10  billion
dollars  in  damage,  taking  82  lives,  and  leaving  56,000  people  homeless.  It  was  the
most damaging hurricane ever recorded, and since then, it has only been surpassed
by Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina.

In the aftermath of Hugo, Andrew, and Katrina, news stories and government of-
ficials  emphasized  that  better  preparations  could  have  helped  save  lives  and  mini-
mize  damages.  A  year  and  a  half  after  the  devastation  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  the
National  Science  Board  issued  their  2007  report,  ‘‘Hurricane  Warning:  The  Critical

Need  for  a  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative,’’  highlighting  that  while  billions
were being spend in rescue and relief efforts, there was a serious lack of federal dol-
lars being invested in hurricane-preparedness research.

Today we will discuss a bill that is based on that NSB report. H.R. 2407, the Na-
tional  Hurricane  Research  Initiative,  directs  the  government  to  make  much  more
significant  investments  in  hurricane-related  research  across  several  agencies,  in-
cluding NOAA and NSF. This initiative outlines key investment categories including
understanding and prediction, impacts, preparedness, and response.

H.R.  2407  authorizes  a  large  sum  of  money  for  this  research  program  ($4.17  B
over ten years). We have an obligation to consider how we can best prepare for hur-
ricanes,  but,  given  our  limited  resources,  we  also  to  need  to  carefully  consider  how
to  best  allocate  those  scarce  resources.  I’ll  be  looking  forward  to  hearing  from  our
witnesses  about  what  they  foresee  will  be  the  monetary  (and  non-monetary)  return
on this proposed federal investment.

Thank you again Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses
on  their  perspectives  of  this  legislation  and  any  suggestions  they  may  have  to  im-
prove it.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Inglis.  We  wish  Mr.  Van

Steenburgh well, as well.

Chairman Baird, you are now recognized for five minutes.
Mr. BAIRD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to join you in wel-
coming  our  colleagues,  Mr.  Hastings  and  Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen,  and
also our distinguished panel of witnesses.

Living  in  the  pacific  northwest  we  only  get  to  look  in  horror  at
what happens to our dear friends to the south, and we want to be,
this  committee,  very  active  in  trying  to  support  your  initiatives  to
prepare  your  area,  region,  and  people  for  better  understanding,
predicting, and dealing with the impacts of hurricanes.

Of  particular  interest  to  me  in  today’s  testimony  and  in  some  of
the  written  comments  from  the  NSB  is  the  role  of  social  scientists
and  social  behavioral  changes.  I  was  speaking  with  a  hurricane
prediction  expert  awhile  back,  and  he  said,  you  know,  Congress-
man, even if we could predict to the minute and the meter, the lo-
cation  of  a  hurricane  impact,  if  60  percent  of  the  people  don’t  pre-
pare,  all  our  predictive  capacity,  all  our  super  computing,  all  our
satellite  observations  won’t  save  a  life.  And  that  is  the  social  and
behavioral  problem.  How  do  we  get  people  to  implement  the  engi-
neering  guidelines?  How  do  we  get  them  to  understand  what  it
means  that  there  is  a  difference  between  a  category  four  or  a  cat-
egory five storm? How do we get planners to prepare actual evacu-
ation? That is what I will be, I think, most interested in as we lis-
ten to our outstanding panel of witnesses.

Thank you for hosting this. Thank you for our distinguished col-
leagues for introducing this important legislation. We welcome you
all here today.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Baird follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BRIAN BAIRD

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  panel  of  witnesses  about  the  steps  needed  to
improve  our  ability  to  prepare  for  and  respond  to  hurricanes.  Hurricanes  of  recent
years  have  brought  to  our  attention  the  significant  and  far-reaching  effects  of  nat-
ural  disasters,  such  as  hurricanes,  on  local  communities  and  the  Nation.  The  dev-
astating  loss  of  life,  dislocation  of  families,  and  damage  to  the  economy  resulting
from  Hurricane  Katrina  and  others  sent  a  loud  and  clear  message.  It  is  imperative
that we improve our understanding of hurricanes and enhance our ability to predict,
prepare for, and respond to them.

Following  a  year  long  assessment  of  the  state  of  hurricane  research  in  our  coun-
try, the National Science Board came forward with a set of recommendations to bet-
ter  align  hurricane  science  and  engineering  research  with  our  national  needs.  The

Board’s  keystone  recommendation  was  that  the  U.S.  engage  in  a  nationally  coordi-
nated,  multi-agency  and  multi-disciplinary  hurricane  research  initiative.  Today  we
will  explore  the  Board’s  recommendations  as  well  as  the  proposed  legislation,  H.R.
2407.

H.R.  2407,  the  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative  (NHRI),  takes  the  general
recommendations of the NSB report and seeks to assemble a multi-agency effort fo-
cused  on  developing  a  better  understanding  of  hurricane  prediction;  intensity;  and
mitigation on coastal populations, infrastructure, and the natural environment.

I hope to hear from our witnesses whether this bill is a workable way to address
the  gaps  in  our  hurricane  research  efforts.  I  look  forward  to  the  assessment  of  cur-
rent federal hurricane research activities and their thoughts on the proposed legisla-
tion. I also welcome their suggestions for ways we might improve the bill.

Finally,  I  am  particularly  interested  in  hearing  how  the  social  and  behavioral
sciences  can  contribute  to  our  understanding  of  the  ways  individuals  and  entire
communities  prepare  for,  respond  to,  and  recover  from  disasters.  I  would  like  to
hear what role social science research could play in addressing the need to transfer
research outcomes into operational practice.

I  thank  my  colleagues  Mr.  Hastings  and  Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen  for  joining  us  today,
and  for  their  effort  in  addressing  this  timely  issue.  Thanks  to  all  of  our  witnesses
for  being  here,  and  I  look  forward  to  your  testimony.  I  now  recognize  the  Ranking
Member for any comments he may wish to make.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Baird,  and  Dr.  Ehlers,  you

are now recognized for five minutes.

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Recent history has proven that the United States needs to be bet-
ter  prepared  for  hurricanes.  There  is  no  question  about  that.  The
impacts of these storms may never be eliminated, but the most del-
eterious  impacts  can  be  mitigated  by  improved  prediction,  stand-
ards, infrastructure, and communication.

I  understand  that  our  federal  research  efforts  in  these  areas  are
insufficient  and  commend  my  colleague,  Mr.  Hastings  of  Florida,
for  putting  the  recommendations  of  a  recent  National  Science
Board  report  into  the  legislation  before  us  today.  I  think  it  is  also
important  to  emphasize  the  research  needed  on  construction  and
infrastructure  standards.  The  Chair  mentioned  earlier  the—I  am
sorry,  Mr.  Inglis  mentioned  earlier  the  number  of  houses  ruined
and  damaged,  and  much  of  that  can  be  mitigated  by  better  con-
struction  methods  and  standards.  And  we  have  to  do  the  research
needed to find out what is the best approach.

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about the proposed
legislation  and  appreciate  the  work  of  the  National  Science  Board
in crafting what the initiative should look like.

And I yield back.

ticularly  in  the  areas  of  construction  and  infrastructure  standards,  we  need  to
strengthen and implement the results of ongoing research.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  about  the  proposed  legislation  and

All  additional  opening  statements  submitted  by  the  Committee

Members will be included in the record at this point.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Good morning. I want to thank the Chairmen of the Energy and Environment and
the  Research  and  Science  Education  Subcommittees  for  holding  this  joint  hearing
on federal priorities regarding hurricane research for our nation.

Members  will  also  hear  testimony  regarding  Congressman  Hastings’  legislation,

H.R. 2407, the National Hurricane Research Initiative Act of 2007.

Hurricane research and preparedness are national security issues.
The  frequency  and  intensity  of  such  storms  have  caused  great  economic  and  per-

sonal damage to American citizens.

It  is  estimated  that  hurricane-related  losses  averaged  more  than  ten  billion  dol-
lars  annually  from  1990  to  1995,  and  upwards  of  $35  billion  a  year  from  2000  to
2006.

Survivors  of  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita  were  left  with  toxic  housing  conditions

and a federal response rate that was unacceptably slow.

Many of these survivors migrated to Texas, causing a sudden increase in the utili-

zation of public services, including hospitals and schools.

There  are  many  trickle-down  economic  effects  that  coincide  with  disasters  of  this

nature.

I  will  be  interested  to  hear  how  Mr.  Hastings’  legislation  seeks  to  coordinate  our

federal hurricane research efforts.

Witnesses  will  report  on  the  status  of  hurricane  research,  ways  in  which  current
research  efforts  could  be  improved,  and  how  the  proposed  legislation  would  affect
the  overall  state  of  our  nation’s  hurricane  preparedness,  including  our  ability  to
save lives and mitigate property loss.

Again,  I  want  to  thank  the  leadership  of  the  two  Subcommittees  for  recognizing
this  issue  as  one  of  importance.  Our  constituents  at  home  need  to  see  that  their
Federal Government is studying these matters in a bipartisan effort to be proactive,
when it comes to storm preparedness.

I thank the Chairmen and yield back the balance of my time.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Carnahan follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Thank you, Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing and to the witnesses for taking

time to be here today.

In  the  aftermath  of  hurricane  Katrina  and  Wilma,  we  can  see  how  devastating
hurricanes  can  be  to  coastal  regions.  It  is  important  to  note  that  hurricanes  rep-
resent  65  percent  of  insured  losses  by  natural  hazards  in  the  U.S.  And,  with  half
of the U.S. population living within 50 miles of coastline, it should be a high priority
to invest in hurricane research.

H.R. 2407, establishes the National Hurricane Research Initiative to set research
objectives to improve hurricane prediction and to better understand the anticipated
impacts hurricanes have on structures. The NHRI would also target research on im-
proved technologies for disaster response and the coordination of evacuations.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  testimony  from  our  distinguished  witnesses  about

H.R. 2407. Thank you for appearing before us today.

Panel I:

Chairman  LAMPSON.  At  this  time  I  would  like  to  introduce  our
first panel. We have with us today Mr. Hastings from Florida who
introduced H.R. 2407, and one of the original co-sponsors, Ms. Ros-
Lehtinen, also from Florida.

Congressman  Hastings,  you  are  recognized  for  five  minutes  to

make your statement.

man  and  Chairman  Baird  and  my  colleagues,  Dr.  Ehlers.  I  came
to  Congress  in  1992,  and  I  cut  my  eye-teeth  in  the  Science  Com-
mittee.  Points  how  long  I  am  here,  other  than  Dr.  Ehlers,  none  of
you  were  here.  And,  yeah,  Roscoe  was  here,  too,  but  it  lets  you
know we have been around awhile.

First  I  would  like  to  thank  the  distinguished  guests  testifying
today,  particularly  those  who  hail  from  Florida  universities,  Dr.
Chen, Dr. Prevatt, and Dr. Leatherman.

And  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  also  like  to  thank  your  staff,  the
Science Committee staff, and my staff and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen’s staff.
These young people do incredible work on our behalf and are rarely
other than among ourselves recognized. And I am really pleased at
how cooperative they have been with us.

Also, I am pleased that we are here to discuss the National Hur-
ricane  Research  Initiative.  I  introduced  this  bill  with  my  dear
friend  and  colleague,  and  we  share  the  distinction  of  having  col-
laborated  on  a  lot  of  legislation  throughout  our  careers,  most  of  it
in the foreign affairs arena, but of course, we do a consider amount
of work on behalf of Florida and this nation as well.

I  would  also  like  to  take  cognizance  of  our  Florida  colleagues,
Senator  Martinez  and  Senator  Nelson,  who  introduced  the  com-
panion legislation in the Senate.

The  legislation  that  the  Subcommittees  are  considering  today  is
based  on  the  recommendations  presented  in  a  2007  National
Science Foundation report on hurricane research. The report deliv-
ered  a  stern  warning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members,  and  I  want  to
reiterate  and  quote  that  warning.  ‘‘Relative  to  the  tremendous
damage  future  hurricanes  will  inflict,  the  current  federal  invest-
ment in hurricane science and engineering is entirely insufficient.’’
Mr.  Chairman,  our  government’s  current  investment  in  hurri-
cane preparation is relegated to providing water bottles and setting
up  storm  shelters  for  at-risk  populations.  In  my  view  such  short-
sighted  preparation  is  wholly  inadequate  and  unacceptable.  We
need  a  long-term  strategy  on  how  to  fill  gaps  in  our  hurricane
knowledge and reduce losses to the best of our ability.

And  let  me  make  it  very  clear  that  the  residual  from  this  kind
of  approach  will  have  an  impact  on  disasters  elsewhere.  As  we
speak,  our  friends  and  colleagues  in  the  mid  west  are  suffering,
and  some  of  that  could  have  been  ameliorated  had  we  had  the  ap-
propriate  attention  advanced  before  the  occurrence  of  the  disaster.
The  entire  Nation  would  deeply  benefit  from  enhanced,  coordi-
nated  hurricane  research  as  required  in  our  bill.  As  co-Chair  of
Florida’s  Congressional  Delegation,  I  have  seen  and  experienced
firsthand  the  destruction  that  hurricanes  have  wreaked  on  our
communities. I have the misfortune that some of you have as well,
of traveling on Air Force One with President Clinton and President
Bush,  and  I  say  misfortune  because  in  those  instances  they  were
coming out to visit hurricane ravaged areas. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and
I were on both those particular sad situations.

But  sadly  people  are  still  living  in  trailers  in  my  Congressional
district.  They  lost  their  homes  in  the  ’04  storms  only  to  have  the
trailer  they  were  given  blow  over  less  than  one  year  later  during
a 2005 hurricane.

Now,  I  recognize  that  the  cost  for  our  bill  is  high,  but  investing
in research now is crucial. Moreover, it is much more efficient than
the  losses  that  will  ensue  when  the  next  hurricane  inevitably
strikes.

Combined,  we  spent  $77  billion  for  recovery  efforts  in  the  fiscal
years 2005 and 2006. Emergency supplement bills. Frankly, our in-
action  will  cost  our  nation  much  more  if  we  fail  to  invest  in  re-
search  now.  Let  me  briefly  mention  a  few  of  the  advancements  of
our  great  universities  represented  by  the  distinguished  panel  be-
fore  us,  and  we  also  have  other  visitors  from  the  fire  department.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen will talk about them later I am sure.

Florida  International  University’s  Wall  of  Wind,  it  is  called
WOW,  has  helped  us  better  predict  storm  survivability,  physical
structures,  and  infrastructure.  The  University  of  Miami’s  Center
for  Southeastern  Tropical  Advanced  Remote  Sensing,  CTARS’s  re-
search,  has  helped  to  improve  our  understanding  of  hurricane
structure, intensity, and movement. The University of Florida’s re-
search is helping to create hurricane-proof homes and hurricane-re-
sistant  building  construction.  And  my  university,  Florida  A&M
University, Mr. Baird, has worked in that social science area in as-
sisting in preparation and warning.

Each  of  these  schools  is  uniquely  positioned  to  conduct  the  vital
hurricane  research  we  are  discussing  here  today.  There  are  many
others,  including  schools  in  Hawaii,  Washington,  Colorado,  Cali-
fornia,  Maryland,  let  us  not  forget  any  of  you,  who  will  also  help
lead us into the future of hurricane research.

Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  an  imperative  that  we  increase  our  federal
investment  and  coordinated  hurricane  research.  Overarching  all  of
this  legislation  is  the  fact  that  disasters  in  this  nation  are  going
to occur. That is regrettable, but it is a fact, and we need to be pre-
pared.

I urge the Committee to hold the markup of the National Hurri-
cane  Research  Initiative  Act  of  2007,  and  as  fast  as  possible,  hope-
fully  following  the  July  recess.  I  stand  ready  and  able  to  assist  in
any  way  possible.  In  my  view  there  is  no  time  for  further  delay.

Thank you very much.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Hastings follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE ALCEE L. HASTINGS

Thank  you,  Chairman  Baird  and  Chairman  Lampson,  for  holding  this  extremely

important hearing today. I am honored to be here.

First, I would like to thank the distinguished guests testifying today, particularly
those who hail from Florida universities: Dr. Shuyi Chen, Dr. David O. Prevatt and
Dr. Stephen P. Leatherman.

I  am  very  pleased  that  we  are  here  to  discuss  the  National  Hurricane  Research
Initiative  Act.  I  introduced  this  bill  with  my  good  friend  and  colleague  Representa-
tive  Ileana  Ros-Lehtinen  (R–FL).  Our  Florida  colleagues,  Senators  Mel  Martinez
and Bill Nelson, introduced the companion legislation in the Senate.

The  legislation  that  the  Subcommittees  are  considering  today  is  largely  based  on
the  recommendations  presented  in  a  2007  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  re-
port,  Hurricane  Warning:  The  Critical  Need  for  a  National  Hurricane  Research  Ini-
tiative.

The report delivered a stern warning that I want to reiterate now:

‘‘Relative  to  the  tremendous  damage  future  hurricanes  will  inflict,  the  current
federal  investment  in  hurricane  science  and  engineering  is  entirely  insufficient.’’
Mr.  Chairmen,  our  government’s  current  investment  in  hurricane  preparation  is
relegated  to  providing  water  bottles  and  setting  up  storm  shelters  for  at-risk  popu-
lations.  In  my  view,  such  short-sighted  preparation  is  wholly  inadequate  and  unac-
ceptable.  We  need  a  long-term  strategy  on  how  to  fill  gaps  in  our  hurricane  knowl-
edge and reduce losses to the best of our ability.

The significant advancements that have been made since the last Category 5 hur-
ricane,  Hurricane  Andrew,  struck  my  home  State  of  Florida  in  1992  are  commend-
able.  Unfortunately,  our  nation’s  vulnerability  only  continues  to  increase  and  we
still  lack  many  of  the  answers.  The  state  of  science  today  is  not  advanced  enough
to  inform  us  reliably  about  when  or  where  hurricanes  are  going  to  strike  or  what
their precise impact on our communities will be.

The  2007  NSF  report  and  the  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative  Act  call  for
a  multi-disciplinary  collaboration  of  relevant  Federal  Government  agencies,  aca-
demia,  industry,  and  other  levels  of  government  to  harness  their  expertise  to  pro-
vide improved hurricane forecasts and response measures.

The entire Nation would deeply benefit from enhanced, coordinated hurricane re-
search.  Better  intensity  forecasting,  long-range  projections  of  hurricane  activity,
emergency management, and hurricane mitigation would be advantageous to every-
one—from improving the ability of local communities to respond to hurricanes to re-
ducing the Federal Government’s share in recovery efforts by billions of dollars.

We are all too aware of the destruction and devastation that individual hurricanes
can cause. As Co-Chair of Florida’s Congressional Delegation, I have seen and expe-
rienced firsthand the destruction that hurricanes have wreaked on my communities,
particularly  those  that  reside  in  coastal  areas  or  surrounding  the  Herbert  Hoover
Dike along Lake Okeechobee.

Since  2001,  hurricane  damage  has  cost  our  nation  almost  $36  billion  in  economic
losses  per  year.  In  2005,  Hurricanes  Katrina,  Rita  and  Wilma  accounted  for  over
$160  billion  in  total  damages  and  the  loss  of  almost  1,500  innocent  lives.  Further,
the  impact  from  inland  flooding  and  tornadoes,  which  can  result  from  the  onset  of
hurricanes and tropical storms, can be felt throughout the entire United States.

Hurricane  Andrew  caused  almost  $35  billion  in  damages  as  measured  by  today’s
economic standards. Experts predict today that if a Category 5 hurricane hit Miami,
it could potentially create an over $100 billion disaster, comparable to the economic
damage New York suffered as a result of 9/11.

Sadly,  from  Miramar  to  Fort  Pierce,  people  are  still  living  in  trailers  in  my  dis-
trict.  They  lost  their  homes  in  the  2004  storms  only  to  have  the  trailer  they  were
given blow over less than one year later during a 2005 hurricane.

I  recognize  that  the  cost  for  our  bill  is  high.  But  as  I,  Representative  Ros-
Lehtinen,  and  the  other  distinguished  panelists  will  relay  today,  investing  in  re-
search  now  is  crucial.  Moreover,  it  is  much  more  cost  efficient  than  the  losses  that
will ensue when the next hurricane inevitably strikes.

The  2004  and  2005  hurricanes  are  a  prime  example  of  the  cost  to  our  Federal
Government.  Combined,  we  spent  $77  billion  for  recovery  efforts  in  the  Fiscal  Year
2005 and Fiscal Year 2006 Emergency Supplemental bills. Frankly, our inaction will
cost our nation much more if we fail to invest in research now.

Consider, 50 percent of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of the coastline.
As populations and economies continue to expand in these high risk coastline areas,
the economic and societal costs will only increase when future hurricanes strike our
nation.

Universities  throughout  the  State  of  Florida,  represented  by  the  distinguished
panel before us, have spearheaded innovative and important advancements in hurri-
cane  research.  It  is  clear  that  by  increasing  our  investment  in  their  fields,  we  can
build on their academic successes and provide nationwide benefits.

Let  me  briefly  mention  a  few  of  the  advancements  our  great  universities  have

made in recent years.

Florida  International  University  (FIU)  leads  the  Florida  System-wide  Hurricane
Mitigation  Alliance,  comprised  of  nine  of  the  eleven  Florida  public  universities.
FIU’s  International  Hurricane  Research  Center  conducts  research  focused  on  the
mitigation  impacts  of  hurricane  damage.  The  Center  has  produced  a  storm  model
to predict highly accurate storm surge heights and flooding potential. FIU’s Wall of
Wind (WoW) simulates the devastating effects of hurricanes to better predict storm
survivability on physical structures, building materials, utilities, and infrastructure.
The  Rosenstiel  School  of  Marine  and  Atmospheric  Science  at  the  University  of
Miami is working tirelessly to conduct research and develop technologies to improve
our hurricane forecast abilities. At the University’s Center for Southeastern Tropical

25

Advanced  Remote  Sensing  (CSTARS),  scientists  have  been  conducting  research
using  remotely-sensed  data  from  Earth-orbiting  satellite  systems  to  help  improve
our understanding of the dynamics of hurricane structure, intensity, and movement.
The  University  of  Florida’s  research  has  improved  our  understanding  of  mitiga-
tion impacts on physical structures and our nation’s infrastructure. At the Broward
County  Windstorm  Damage  Mitigation  Training  and  Demonstration  Center,  the
University  of  Florida  is  helping  to  create  hurricane-proof  homes  and  hurricane-re-
sistant  building  construction.  The  University’s  hurricane  simulator  delivers  winds
up  to  130  miles  per  hour  intended  to  mimic  the  effects  of  hurricanes  to  strengthen
building  components  and  improve  installation  procedures  to  reduce  hurricane  dam-
age.

Each  of  these  schools  is  uniquely  positioned  to  conduct  the  vital  hurricane  re-
search  we  are  discussing  here  today.  There  are  many  others,  including  schools  in
Hawaii, Colorado and California, who will also help lead us into the future of hurri-
cane research.

As  growing  research  indicates,  hurricane  trends  are  linked  to  climate  change.  In
the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration’s  (NOAA)  U.S.  Climate
Change  Science  Program  (CCSP)  recent  report,  Weather  and  Climate  Extremes  in
a  Changing  Climate,  scientific  evidence  details  that  future  climate  changes  will  be
accompanied by extreme events, including hurricanes. The report specifically states,
‘‘For North Atlantic and North Pacific hurricanes, it is likely that rainfall and wind
speeds will increase in response to human-caused warming. Analyses of model sim-
ulations  suggest  that  for  each  1°C  (1.8°F)  increase  in  tropical  sea  surface  tempera-
tures,  core  rainfall  rates  will  increase  by  six  percent  to  18  percent  and  the  surface
wind  speeds  of  the  strongest  hurricanes  will  increase  by  about  one  percent  to  eight
percent.’’

NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center’s 2008 hurricane season outlook indicates that
there  could  be  a  more  than  60  percent  chance  of  up  to  16  named  storms,  including
up  to  14  hurricanes,  five  of  which  would  be  categorized  as  ‘‘major.’’  This  prediction
serves as a stark reminder of the pressing need to conduct such research.

Mr.  Chairmen,  our  government  can  ill  afford  to  ignore  the  advice  of  its  premier
scientists  and  put  our  populations  and  infrastructure  at  risk.  It  is  imperative  that
we take significant actions to increase federal investment in new research to better
prepare  for,  respond  to,  and  mitigate  the  devastating  impacts  of  hurricanes.  Let  us
resolve to act promptly to address ways to prevent and respond to future hurricanes
before the next hurricane strikes.

I urge the Committee to hold a markup of the National Hurricane Research Initia-
tive  Act  of  2007  immediately  following  the  July  recess.  I  stand  ready  and  able  to
assist in any way possible. There is no time for further delay.

Thank you very much.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hastings,  very,  very  much.

And add Texas to that list.

Congresswoman  Ros-Lehtinen,  you  are  recognized  for  five  min-

utes. You may begin.
STATEMENT OF HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, A REPRESENTA-
TIVE  IN  CONGRESS  FROM  THE  STATE  OF  FLORIDA,  18TH
DISTRICT
Ms.  ROS-LEHTINEN.  Well,  thank  you  so  much,  Chairman
Lampson, Chairman Baird, Ranking Member Inglis, Ranking Mem-
ber  Ehlers.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity.  I  am  glad  to  see  our
Florida  colleague,  Mario  Diaz-Balart,  no  stranger  to  hurricanes,
here with us as well.

And I am so glad to have the opportunity to work again with my
wonderful  friend  and  my  dear  colleague,  Congressman  Alcee
Hastings,  on  this  important  bill,  and  I  would  like  to  acknowledge
the  panelists  and  the  guests  who  are  here  from  our  home  area  of
South  Florida.  Dr.  Stephen  Leatherman,  the  Chair  Professor  and
Director  of  the  International  Hurricane  Research  Center  and  Lab-
oratory  for  Coastal  Research  at  my  alma  mater,  Florida  Inter-
national University, Dr. Shuyi Chen, Professor at the University of

let  me  say  thank  you  to  David  Downy,  the  Division  Chief  with
Miami  Dade’s  Fire  Rescue  in  Urban  Search  and  Rescue,  who  is
here with us today, representing Miami Dade County and the Flor-
ida Keys, two regions which often bear the full brunt of hurricanes.
I  have  gained  a  great  deal  of  personal  experience  about  pre-
paring  for  and  recovering  from  hurricanes.  Throughout  my  life  in
South  Florida  I  have  experienced  storms  including  Hurricane  Isa-
bel, Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Charlie, Hurricane Wilma, Hur-
ricane  Katrina,  just  to  name  a  few,  and  the  sheer  devastation  left
in the aftermath of those natural disasters often can be financially
and  personally  crippling  to  individuals,  families,  and  businesses.
With  the  help  of  early  warning  information  and  more  in-depth  re-
search  from  scientists,  we  can  help  our  constituents  properly  pre-
pare for and evacuate before these hurricane and natural disasters
hit.

The National Hurricane Research Initiative Act, which Alcee and
I are working on, will fund and support organizations dedicated to
improving  the  forecasting  of  storms  and  researching  the  weather
patterns.  It  is  vital  for  the  advancement  of  early  warning  systems
and tracking mechanisms. It is our obligation to take advantage of
these  opportunities.  Right  now  the  tracking  of  hurricanes  re-
mains—means  that  large  areas  fall  under  evacuation  warnings.
What happens? Well, as with any repetitive activity, the frequency
of  these  hurricane-prone  areas  receiving  these  evacuation  orders
means  that  it  lessens  their  impact.  More  people  in  my  home  dis-
trict  will  not  evacuate  until  the  last  possible  moment  and  often-
times then that is too late.

Congressman Baird, who knows the Keys and understands, there
is one road in and one road out. Hurricane trackers deserve a great
deal  of  respect  for  the  gains  they  have  made  in  recent  years  on
path  prediction,  but  their  margin  of  error  is  still  too  great.  The
cone  is  still  too  large.  Giving  these  scientists  the  tools  necessary
will  make  enormous  positive  differences  for  all  of  our  constituents.
Hurricanes  threaten  more  than  just  Florida,  as  the  Chairman
pointed  out.  Louisiana,  Texas,  Mississippi,  Alabama,  California,
Georgia, the Carolinas, most coastal states. In fact, over 50 percent
of  the  United  States’  population  live  within  50  miles  off  of  our
coast.

A  number  of  major  category  four  and  five  hurricanes  worldwide,
the  number  have  nearly  doubled  over  the  past  35  years,  and  the
devastation  left  in  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  we  all
know,  and  that  was  only  a  category  four.  It  remains  a  tragic  re-
minder  of  how  ill-equipped  our  nation  is  to  deal  with  widespread
disaster.

So it is, indeed, our obligation to ensure that each and every cit-
izen  who  may  reside  in  harm’s  way  has  the  information  needed  to
prepare and to evacuate if needed from these storms. As Bill Reed,
the Director of the NOAA Weather, National Weather Service, stat-
ed  this  month  at  a  hurricane-preparedness  summit  that  I  had  in
the  Keys,  storms  can  intensify  at  the  last  minute  and  cause  sub-
stantial losses of life and property that could be avoided with better
methods of prediction.

In  this  summit  we  also  learned  from  experts  on  the  dangers  im-
posed on residents not evacuating during hurricanes. All vital serv-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:23 Dec 13, 2008 Jkt 042964 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\R&SE08\062608\42964 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

27

ices such as water, power, and even hospitals, remain closed for as
long  as  a  few  weeks  after  a  significant  storm.  Persons  who  do  not
evacuate pose a serious burden to already strained rescuers. Saving
lives,  of  course,  remains  our  focus.  This  bill  will  also  save  U.S.
money.

In  ’92,  Hurricane  Andrew  caused  approximately  $21  billion  in
losses  to  South  Florida  alone.  In  2007,  the  economic  impact  of  one
storm evacuation was $6.5 million in the Keys alone. So with better
information  provided  by  scientists,  these  losses  could  have  been
much  less.  FEMA  spent  $35.8  billion  per  year  during  the  last  five
years  on  natural  disasters,  and  that  was  $168  billion  in  losses  of
home and property in the years 2004, and 2005, alone.

So the benefits, the financial benefits of preparedness are readily
apparent,  and  we  can  significantly  cut  the  expenses  of  our  govern-
ment  by  knowing  beforehand  where  these  storms  will  make  land-
fall.  Our  constituents  demand  that  we  refine  our  forecasting,  and
the bill before you will do just that.

Thank  you  so  much  to  the  Chairmen,  thank  you  to  the  Ranking

Members for the opportunity. I hope you move swiftly.
[The prepared statement Ms. Ros-Lehtinen follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN

Thank you, Chairmen Baird and Lampson. Thank you, Ranking Members Ehlers
and  Inglis.  I  am  glad  that  you  are  holding  this  important  joint-hearing  and  for  the
opportunity  to  speak  in  support  of  H.R.  2407,  a  bill  which  I  co-introduced  with  my
dear friend and Florida Delegation colleague Alcee Hastings. I would like to also ac-
knowledge  those  panelists  from  my  home  district  in  South  Florida:  Dr.  Stephen
Leatherman,  Chair  Professor  and  Director  of  the  International  Hurricane  Research
Center  &  Laboratory  for  Coastal  Research  at  my  alma  mater  Florida  International
University. Dr. Shuyi Chen, Professor at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School
of Marine & Atmospheric Sciences. Also let me say thank you to David Downey, Di-
vision Chief with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue’s Urban Search and Rescue, who is here
with  us  today.  Representing  Miami-Dade  and  the  Florida  Keys,  two  regions  which
often bear the full impact of hurricanes, I have gained a great deal of personal expe-
rience about preparing for and recovering from storms.

Throughout  my  life  in  Miami,  I  have  experienced  storms  including  Hurricane
Isabell,  Hurricane  Andrew,  Hurricane  Charley,  Hurricane  Wilma,  and  Hurricane
Katrina  just  to  name  a  few.  The  sheer  devastation  left  in  the  aftermath  of  these
natural  disasters  often  can  be  financially  and  personally  crippling  to  individuals,
families,  and  businesses.  With  the  help  of  early  warning  information  and  more  in
depth  research  from  scientists,  we  can  help  our  constituents  properly  prepare  for
and evacuate from these natural disasters. The National Hurricane Research Initia-
tive  Act  will  fund  and  support  organizations  dedicated  to  the  forecasting  of  storms
and  the  researching  of  weather  patterns.  This  is  vital  to  the  advancement  of  warn-
ing and tracking mechanisms. It is our obligation to take advantage of these oppor-
tunities.

Right  now,  the  tracking  of  hurricanes  means  large  areas  fall  under  evacuation
warnings.  As  with  any  repetitive  activity,  the  frequency  of  which  hurricane  prone
areas such as mine are subjected to these warnings lessens their impact. Many peo-
ple in my home district will not evacuate until the last possible moment, and often
times  by  then  it  is  too  late.  Hurricane  trackers  deserve  a  great  deal  of  respect  for
the  gains  they  have  made  in  recent  years  on  path  prediction,  however,  the  margin
of error is still too great.

Giving  these  scientists  the  tools  necessary  will  make  an  enormous  positive  dif-
ference in the lives all our constituents. Hurricanes threaten more than just Florida;
they  affect  Louisiana,  Texas,  Mississippi,  Alabama,  California,  Georgia,  and  the
Carolina’s and most coastal states. To make the importance of this matter more ap-
parent, over 50 percent of the United States population lives within 50 miles of the
coast. The number of major Category 4 and 5 hurricanes worldwide has nearly dou-
bled over the past 35 years.

The  devastation  left  in  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  only  a  Category  4,
remains a tragic reminder of how ill-equipped our nation is to deal with widespread

disaster.  It  is  our  obligation  to  ensure  that  each  and  every  citizen  that  may  reside
in  harms  way  has  the  information  needed  to  prepare  and  evacuate  from  these
storms.

As  Bill  Read,  the  Director  of  the  NOAA  National  Weather  Service,  stated  this
month  at  my  Hurricane  Preparedness  Summit  in  the  Florida  Keys:  Storms  can  in-
tensify  at  the  last  minute  and  cause  substantial  losses  of  life  and  property  that
could  be  avoided  with  better  methods  of  prediction.  During  my  hurricane  summit
we  also  learned  from  experts  on  the  dangers  imposed  on  residents  not  evacuating
during  hurricanes.  All  vital  services  such  as  water,  power,  and  even  hospitals  re-
main  closed  for  as  long  as  a  few  weeks  after  a  significant  storm.  Persons  who  do
not  evacuate  also  pose  a  serious  burden  to  already  strained  rescuers.  Saving  lives
must remain our focus. This bill will also save the U.S. money.

In  1992,  Hurricane  Andrew  caused  approximately  $21  billion  in  losses  to  South
Florida.  In  2007,  the  economic  impact  of  storm  evacuation  was  $6.5  million  in  the
Florida Keys. With better information provided by scientists, these losses could have
been  much  less.  FEMA  spent  $35.8  billion  per  year  during  the  last  five  years  on
natural  disasters.  There  was  $168  billion  in  losses  of  home  and  property  in  2004
and 2005 alone.

The  financial  benefits  of  preparedness  are  readily  apparent.  We  can  significantly
cut  the  government’s  expenses  by  knowing  beforehand  where  these  storms  will
make  landfall.  Our  constituents  demand  that  we  refine  our  forecasting.  Having  to
evacuate  disrupts  lives  and  with  the  price  of  gas  still  climbing,  is  extraordinarily
financially  burdensome.  However,  no  monetary  figure  can  be  placed  a  human  life
and  protecting  our  constituents  must  remain  the  focus  of  this  legislation.  The
progress  that  will  result  from  this  bill  will  offer  invaluable  assistance  to  all  of  our
communities.

The current hurricane season began on June 1, 2008. Three weeks of this season
have  already  passed  and  it  is  imperative  that  this  bill  receive  quick  attention.  I
hope  that  this  committee  will  move  swiftly  on  this  legislation  and  I  appreciate  the
opportunity to voice my comments to you this morning.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  both  of  you  for  your  testimony.  You
pointed  out  the  tragedy,  and  you  pointed  out  the  real  savings  that
are  available  in  life,  property,  and  resources.  When  we  plan,  we
can  make  a  huge  difference  for  the  American  people,  and  that  is
exactly  what  you  are  trying  to  do.  We  appreciate  you  coming  here
and  you  bringing  the  information  and  the  stories  that  you  have,
and we look forward to working with the legislation.

If  there  are  no  questions  for  this  first  panel,  then  we  will  take
a very short break, very short break, before hearing from our next
panel of witnesses.

Thank  you  both  very,  very  much.  And  if  the  rest  of  you  would

come up and take their places.

[Recess.]

Panel II:

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Before  we  begin,  I  would  ask  unanimous
consent that we welcome Congressman Hastings to join us here on
this.

Seeing no objection, it is so ordered. Welcome.

Dr.  Shuyi  Chen  is  an  Associate  Professor  of  Meteorology  and
Physical  Oceanography  at  the  University  of  Miami,  Rosenstiel
School  of  Marine  and  Atmospheric  Sciences.  That  is  a  lot  of  big
words there.

And  Dr.  David  O.  Prevatt  is  an  Assistant  Professor  at  the  De-
partment  of  Civil  and  Coastal  Engineering  at  the  University  of
Florida.

And I would now like to recognize our colleague, Mr. Diaz-Balart

from Florida, to recognize our final witness.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  It  is
truly  a  privilege  actually  to  see  all  of  these  fine  men  and  women,
but  it  is  my  privilege  today  to  welcome  Dr.  Stephen  Leatherman
to this committee.

Since 1997, Dr. Leatherman has served as the Chairman and Di-
rector  of  the  International  Hurricane  Research  Center  at  Florida
International  University,  which  is  located  in  South  Florida  in
Miami.  FIU  serves  thousands  of  students,  Mr.  Chairman,  in  the
South  Florida  area  and  the  South  Florida  community.  It  is  an  ex-
ceptional  university  with  exceptional  faculty,  exceptional  talent,
and exceptional leadership.

The Center’s main objectives are to mitigate and prevent damage
from  hurricanes  and  to  assist  communities  in  dealing  with  the
aftermath of those very destructive storms. Unfortunately, in Flor-
ida and South Florida we have way too much experience with those
storms. And, again, the Center was established by the private sec-
tor  in  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Andrew,  which  caused  some
debts and also billions of dollars in economic loss in 1992.

The  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  Center  include  some  of  the  most
well-respected  and  notable  members  of  our  community.  Now,  on  a
lighter  note,  Mr.  Chairman,  my  dear  friend,  Dr.  Leatherman,  is
also, well, he has obviously a lot of expertise in hurricanes, but he
also has expertise on storm impacts on coastal areas, but he is also
known  as  Dr.  Beach  around  the  world.  I  am  sure  all  of  you  have
heard  about  Dr.  Beach.  As  Dr.  Beach  he  has  selected  the  annual
top  ten  beaches,  correct?  Around  since  1991.  I  am  pleased  that
Florida is home to three of the top ten beaches, including the num-
ber  one  beach,  and  I  am  sure  all  of  us  here  on  this  committee
would  agree  that  even  though  it  is  a  very  tough  job,  we  are  glad
that  somebody  is  willing  to  do  that,  to  go  around  and  figure  out
which are the best beaches in town.

But, anyways, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, sir, for
appearing.  It  is  a  privilege  to  introduce  a  dear  friend,  somebody
who I have not only known and respected but have admired for so
many  years.  Thank  you,  sir,  and  we  look  forward  to  your  testi-
mony, my friend.

Mr. EHLERS. Will the gentleman yield?
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Yes, sir.
Mr. EHLERS. Thank you for yielding. I just wanted to make sure
so  I  will  know  the  credibility  of  the  witnesses,  I  assume  you  have
also ranked the Lake Michigan Beaches.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  I  think  we  are  out  of  time,  Mr.  Chairman.  I

think my time is out now.

Chairman LAMPSON. I will stay out of that fray.

Well, you will each have five minutes for your spoken testimony.
Your written testimony will be included in the record for the hear-
ing.  When  you  are  all  complete  with  your  testimony,  then  we  will
begin  with  questions,  and  each  Member  will  have  five  minutes  to
question the panel.

With that, I would ask Dr. Hayes to begin.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  JOHN  L.  ‘‘JACK’’  HAYES,  ASSISTANT  AD-
MINISTRATOR  FOR  WEATHER  SERVICES;  DIRECTOR,  NA-
TIONAL  WEATHER  SERVICE,  NATIONAL  OCEANIC  AND  AT-
MOSPHERIC  ADMINISTRATION,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF  COM-
MERCE
Dr. HAYES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Com-
mittee for this opportunity to testify on the importance of increased
hurricane research and preparedness. I am Jack Hayes, the Assist-
ant Administrator for Weather Services and the Director of the Na-
tional Weather Service.

The National Weather Service is a line office of the National Oce-
anic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  within  the  Department  of
Commerce.

The  proposed  legislation,  H.R.  2407,  the  National  Hurricane  Re-
search  Initiative  Act  of  2007,  recognizes  the  challenge  we  face  as
a  nation  with  regard  to  hurricanes  and  tropical  cyclones,  and  we
applaud the Committee for addressing this complex issue.

We  agree  with  the  overall  goal  of  the  bill  to  improve  hurricane
forecasting  and  preparedness.  We  also  agree  with  the  most  effec-
tive  path  forward  is  for  NOAA  and  the  National  Science  Founda-
tion  to  co-chair  a  committee  to  oversee  and  coordinate  federally-
funded  research  efforts  and  ensure  successful  research  efforts  that
can be incorporated into the operational forecast and warning envi-
ronment to improve hurricane forecasts and services.

The  key  to  success  to  improve  hurricane  prediction  is  leveraging
the  capabilities  of  all  partners;  federal,  State,  local,  academic,  and
private  sector.  While  the  bill  focuses  on  non-federal  assets,  we  be-
lieve federal programs need to be fiscally supported as well as aca-
demic  research  and  State  and  local  government  programs.  We
agree with the need for broad areas of research to address the com-
prehensive impacts of hurricanes.

There are many components to the overall hurricane and tropical
cyclone  issue  as  outlined  in  the  bill.  Over  the  past  year  NOAA  de-
veloped  the  Hurricane  Forecasting  Improvement  Project  or  HFIP
for  short,  described  in  my  written  testimony.  HFIP  focuses  our  ef-
forts to improve forecasts of track, intensity, wind fields, and storm
surge,  and  identifies  improvements  in  observations  and  computing
capabilities needed to support these forecast improvements.

We  are  trying  to  make  progress  on  other  activities  described  in
the bill as well, such as improved forecasts for inland flooding, and
those  efforts  will  further  benefit  from  improved  hurricane  track
and intensity predictions.

Many federal agencies, State and local governments, and the aca-
demic  and  research  communities  are  focused  on  improving  hurri-
cane prediction. NOAA has expertise in many areas outlined in the
purposes  section  of  the  bill,  including  research  to  understand  the
impact  between  hurricanes,  climate,  and  natural  ecosystems.

NOAA  conducts  its  research  on  these  topics  through  its  labora-
tories and centers, including the Atlantic Oceanographic and Mete-
orological  Laboratory,  the  Earth  System  Research  Laboratory,  the
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, and the National Centers
for  Environmental  Prediction.  This  expertise  and  experience  will
help  NOAA  and  the  National  Science  Foundation  under  the  aus-
pices of this bill coordinate federally-funded efforts on hurricane re-
search.

Other  federal  agencies  identified  in  the  bill  are  better  suited  to
lead  the  work  and  provide  expertise  for  engineered  structures,  the
national  infrastructure,  disaster  response  and  recovery  technology,
and  evacuation  planning.  For  example,  Department  of  Commerce’s
National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  does  extensive
work with the impact of wind on structures, and the Federal Emer-
gency  Management  Agency  in  the  Department  of  Homeland  Secu-
rity  has  expertise  for  evacuation  planning  and  an  extensive  pro-
gram addressing technologies for disaster response and recovery.

Section  four  of  the  bill  proposes  a  national  infrastructure  data-
base.  We  do  not  believe  NOAA  is  properly  positioned  to  lead  the
effort  for  such  information.  We  suggest  other  federal  agencies  may
offer  a  more  suitable  lead  for  this  activity.  We  believe  efforts  fo-
cused  on  improved  track  and  intensity  forecasts  will  have  the
greatest impact to the Nation, but efforts in other areas are needed
as well.

We see the federal role as critical to ensure federally-funded hur-
ricane  research  focuses  on  the  needs  of  society.  That  includes  re-
search on societal dimensions of the hurricane challenge, including
response,  recovery,  mitigation,  and  planning.  We  also  believe  it  is
a function of the Federal Government to ensure the path is in place
for  research  to  be  integrated  into  operations.  This  step  is  often
under-funded,  delaying  and  complicating  the  transition  of  success-
ful  research  into  operations.  Our  Hurricane  Forecast  Improvement
Plan  has  a  focus  on  enabling  the  efficient  and  rapid  transfer  of  ef-
fective research into operations.

In  conclusion,  let  me  restate,  we  applaud  the  Committee’s  broad
perspective of hurricane impacts and the need for research in areas
including  storm  structure,  rapid  intensity  change,  ocean  atmos-
pheric  interactions,  storm  surge,  rainfall,  and  inland  flooding  fore-
casts.  The  key  to  success  in  improving  hurricane  prediction  is
leveraging  all  available  national  assets  and  capabilities  to  address
this  national  need.  NOAA’s  Hurricane  Forecast  Improvement  Plan
addresses a path forward for many of the items outlined in the Na-
tional Hurricane Research Initiative Act of 2007.

We agree the most effective role for NOAA and NSF is to co-chair
a  committee  to  oversee  and  coordinate  federally-funded  hurricane
research efforts to ensure successful work can be incorporated into
operational  forecasts  and  warning  environment,  with  the  overall
goal of improved hurricane forecasts and services.

I  thank  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  about  this
challenge,  and  we  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Committee  as
the legislation moves forward.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN L. HAYES

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee for this opportunity to
testify  on  the  importance  of  increased  hurricane  research  and  preparedness.  I  am
Jack  Hayes,  Assistant  Administrator  for  Weather  Services  and  the  Director  of  the
National  Weather  Service  (NWS).  The  National  Weather  Service  is  a  line  office  of
the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA),  within  the  Depart-
ment of Commerce (DOC).

The  proposed  legislation,  H.R.  2407,  the  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative
Act  of  2007,  recognizes  the  challenge  we  face  as  a  nation,  with  regard  to  hurricane
and  tropical  cyclones,  and  we  applaud  the  Committee  for  addressing  this  complex
issue.

Introduction

We  agree  with  the  overall  goal  of  the  bill  to  improve  hurricane  forecasting  and
preparedness.  We  also  agree  the  most  effective  path  forward  is  for  NOAA  and  the
National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  to  co-chair  a  committee,  such  as  the  National
Hurricane Research Alliance, to oversee and coordinate federally funded research ef-
forts,  and  to  ensure  successful  research  efforts  can  be  incorporated  into  the  oper-
ational  forecast  and  warning  environment  to  improve  hurricane  forecasts  and  serv-
ices.  However,  the  proposed  authorization  levels  in  the  bill  are  significantly  higher
than  current  funding  levels,  and  are  therefore  inconsistent  with  the  Administra-
tion’s priorities.

NOAA is already addressing many components to the overall hurricane and trop-
ical  cyclone  issue  outlined  in  H.R.  2407.  Over  the  past  year  NOAA  developed  the
Hurricane  Forecast  Improvement  Project  (HFIP—described  in  detail  below),  which
focuses  our  efforts  on  improved  forecasts  of  track,  intensity,  wind  fields,  and  storm
surge,  which  require  improved  observations,  modeling,  and  computing  capability.
We  are  making  progress  on  other  activities  described  in  the  bill  as  well,  such  as
improved forecasts for inland flooding, and these efforts will further benefit from im-
proved hurricane track and intensity predictions.

Many  federal  agencies,  State  and  local  governments,  and  the  academic  and  re-
search community are focused on improving hurricane prediction. NOAA’s expertise
can  be  leveraged  for  most  of  the  items  outlined  in  the  Purposes  section  of  the  bill,
including  research  to  understand  the  impact  between  hurricanes,  climate,  and  nat-
ural ecosystems. NOAA conducts much of this relevant research through its labora-
tories and centers including the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Labora-
tory,  the  Earth  System  Research  Laboratory,  the  Geophysical  Fluid  Dynamics  Lab-
oratory, and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Other federal agen-
cies  identified  in  the  bill  are  better  suited  to  lead  the  work  and  provide  expertise
for  engineered  structures,  the  national  infrastructure,  disaster  response/recovery
technology  and  evacuation  planning.  For  example,  DOC’s  National  Institute  of
Standards  and  Technology  does  extensive  work  with  the  impact  of  wind  on  struc-
tures and the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Department of Home-
land  Security  has  expertise  for  evacuation  planning  and  has  an  extensive  program
addressing technologies for disaster response and recovery.

Section  4  of  the  bill  proposes  a  National  Infrastructure  Database.  We  do  not  be-
lieve  NOAA  is  properly  positioned  to  lead  the  effort  for  such  information.  We  sug-
gest  other  federal  agencies  may  offer  a  more  suitable  lead  for  this  activity.  We  be-
lieve efforts focused on improved track and intensity forecasts will have the greatest
impact to the Nation, but efforts in all other areas are needed as well.

Since  1990,  hurricane  forecast  track  accuracy  has  increased  by  about  50  percent
through the use of enhanced observations, improved model guidance, and increased
forecaster  expertise.  This  has  led  to  increased  lead  time  and  somewhat  smaller
warning areas allowing more time for emergency managers to coordinate their evac-
uation  and  preparedness  activities.  However,  little  progress  has  been  made  during
this  period  to  increase  the  accuracy  of  intensity1 forecasts  and  to  identify  rapid  in-
tensity changes in hurricanes. Rapid intensity change presents a challenge to hurri-
cane  forecasters  during  the  life  of  a  storm  and  a  serious  problem  for  emergency
managers when it occurs just prior to landfall. Rapid intensity events constitute an
approximate  two-category  change  within  one  day,  and  have  a  significant  impact  on
preparedness and evacuation actions for emergency managers. Recent cases of rapid
intensity changes at or near the U.S. coastline have occurred with little or no warn-
ing.

With recent catastrophic events in 2005 of Katrina and Wilma, back-to-back Cat-
egory 5 storms in the Caribbean Sea in 2007 (Dean and Felix), and storms that rap-
idly  intensified  just  prior  to  landfall  like  Charley  in  2004  and  Humberto  in  2007,
the  time  is  now  for  the  Federal  Government  and  our  partners  in  State  and  local
governments, and the research and academic communities, to undertake an aggres-
sive effort to improve our national hurricane forecasting capability.

This message and sense of urgency for improved hurricane forecasts is consistent
with  the  overarching  recommendations  in  three  recent  reports:  the  2006  NOAA
Science  Advisory  Board  Hurricane  Intensity  Research  Working  Group  report,  the
2007  report  of  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  National  Science  Board
(NSB):  Hurricane  Warning:  The  Critical  Need  for  a  National  Hurricane  Research
Initiative,  and  the  2007  report  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  Federal  Coordinator  of
Meteorological  Services  (OFCM):  Interagency  Strategic  Research  Plan  for  Tropical
Cyclones—The  Way  Ahead.  All  three  reports  recommend  a  significant  increase  in
funding for hurricane and tropical cyclone research and development, and transition
of  research  to  operations.  In  addition,  many  studies  and  reports  have  shown  that
investments in forecasts and other warning information needed for community plan-
ners  have  a  significant  return  for  the  Nation,  including  the  2007  report  issued  by
the  National  Hazards  Review,2 Hurricane  Forecasting:  The  State  of  the  Art,  and  a
report from the Multi-hazard Mitigation Council (MMC) of the National Institute of
Building Sciences.3

Need for Improved Hurricane Forecasts

‘‘Billions  of  tax  dollars  have  been  provided  for  rescue,  recovery,  and  rebuilding
after  hurricanes  strike  . . .  recent  hurricanes  have  focused  public  attention  on
the  imperative  to  enhance  our  understanding  of  tropical  weather  systems  and
their  multi-faceted  impacts,  ranging  from  geophysical  and  engineering  elements
to  human  economic  dimensions  . . .  improving  our  nation’s  ability  to  become
more resilient to hurricane impacts.’’ 4

More  than  50  percent  of  the  U.S.  population  is  living  within  50  miles  of  the
coast,5 and  roughly  180  million  people  visit  the  coast  annually.  The  coastal  popu-
lation  explosion  (Figure  1)  over  the  last  half-century  translates  to  increased  risks
for these coastal communities. As the U.S. coastline continues to develop, more peo-
ple will be at risk and impacts are expected to further increase. Annual U.S. hurri-
cane  losses  average  about  $10  billion  and  a  recent  historical  analysis  of  hurricane
damages from 1900 to 2005 suggests a doubling of economic losses from land falling
hurricanes  every  ten  years.6 The  need  for  substantial  improvements  in  hurricane
track and intensity forecast capabilities has never been greater. This is a sentiment
echoed by our partners in the emergency management communities at the national,
regional and local levels, who are issuing strong demands to extend hurricane fore-
cast  lead  times.  These  extended  lead  times  are  necessary  to  evacuate  some  coastal
locations that now require evacuation ‘‘orders’’ be issued 48 to 72 hours in advance.
Highly  accurate  hurricane  forecasts  are  needed  to  ensure  the  timely  issuance  of
reliable  hurricane  watches  and  warnings.  These  forecasts  are  an  essential  factor  in
avoiding  loss  of  life  and  injury  and  reduced  property  loss  and  economic  disruption.
Without  accurate  hurricane  forecasts,  emergency  managers  are  unable  to  take  nec-
essary  decisive  action  to  save  lives  and  mitigate  economic  loses.  The  expected  out-
comes  of  the  HFIP  are  to  provide  higher  quality  information  with  associated  prob-
abilities  on  high  impact  variables,  such  as  wind  speed,  precipitation,  and  storm
surge; and to extend the lead time beyond five days, and reduce the length and du-
ration of watches and warnings.

Operational Needs

Operational  needs  expressed  by  the  tropical  cyclone  operations  centers  (National
Hurricane  Center  (NHC),  Central  Pacific  Hurricane  Center,  and  the  Joint  Typhoon
Warning  Center)  are  detailed  in  the  OFCM  report,  Interagency  Strategic  Research
Plan  for  Tropical  Cyclones—The  Way  Ahead.  These  operational  needs  support  the

overarching  goal  to  produce  improved  wind  speed,  precipitation,  and  storm  surge
analysis and forecast information and to provide associated probabilities, as well as
the uncertainty in the forecasts, to emergency managers and other decision-makers.
To  meet  these  operational  needs,  critical  steps  to  ensure  the  future  success  of  the
Nation’s  hurricane  forecast  and  warning  program  include:  focused  applied  research
and  transition  efforts  to  improve  computer  models;  advanced  observations  and  ob-
servational  strategies;  improved  processing  capabilities  to  include  those  data  into
the  models;  expanded  forecaster  tools;  and  properly  applied  human  and  infrastruc-
ture  resources.  Furthermore,  extensive  collaboration  with  social  scientists  is  also
needed  to  help  ensure  the  information  presented  to  the  public  can  be  understood
in clear terms by non-meteorologists.

NOAA’s  mission-oriented  requirements  for  operational  system  development,  im-
plementation  and  sustained  operations  guide  us  toward  attaining  a  specific  set  of
short-term  forecast  goals,  related  applied  research  focus  areas,  and  infrastructure
investments.  Within  this  mission-oriented  context,  the  research  and  transition  ac-
tivities  needed  to  improve  operational  forecasts  are  accomplished  with  the  aid  of
testbeds  strategically  aligned  with  the  needs  of  the  forecast  centers.  In  general,
testbeds are a collaborative environment for conducting integrative research, testing
new ideas in an end-to-end fashion under the rigors of operational constraints (real
and  simulated),  and  facilitating  the  deployment  into  operational  practice  of  knowl-
edge gained in research (NSB Report 2007).

Testbeds,  such  as  the  Joint  Hurricane  Testbed  in  Miami,  the  Developmental
Testbed  Center  in  Boulder,  and  the  Joint  Center  for  Satellite  Data  Assimilation  in
Maryland,  are  oriented  toward  improving  operational  hurricane  forecasts  and  guid-
ance. These testbeds provide evolutionary pathways to coordinate applied model and
technology  advancements  to  specific  forecast  requirements  and  focus  on  identifying
and effecting the transition of research and technologies capable of providing imme-
diate and justifiable improvements to operational hurricane forecasts.

Bridging across the OFCM and NSB reports, the NOAA HFIP plan involves evolu-
tionary  and  transformational  pathways  that  require  coordination  between  key  fed-
eral  and  academic  leaders  in  order  to  properly  support  the  required  research  and
development and to improve the operational hurricane track and intensity forecasts.

Building Off the Nation’s Interagency Strategic Research Plan

Within  our  HFIP,  we  are  working  to  build  upon  recent  planning  efforts  of  the
NSF,  NSB  and  OFCM7 to  engage  the  broader  research  community  in  improving
hurricane  forecasts.  The  HFIP’s  goals  include  improving  the  accuracy,  reliability,
and  extending  the  lead  time  of  hurricane  forecasts  and  increasing  confidence  in
those forecasts by customers and decision-makers, especially those in the emergency
management  community.  These  goals  were  also  echoed  by  the  NOAA  Science  Advi-
sory Board’s Hurricane Intensity Research Working Group.

Within  the  framework  of  operational  hurricane  forecast  improvements,  NOAA
seeks  a  partnership  among  the  federal  and  academic  communities  to  align  the
broader science and engineering community with the operational community to real-
ize the greatest benefits for the country. This broader partnership is critical to effec-
tively address HFIP goals and for NOAA to transition new research and technology
into operations.

NOAA Strategy to Align with the Larger Community

The key to success in improving hurricane prediction is leveraging the capabilities
of  all  partners:  federal,  State,  local,  academic,  and  private  sector.  Communication
between federal partners and the external community on operational needs and as-
sociated  research  focus  areas  is  necessary  to  achieve  both  immediate  successes  and
scientific  research  advances  that  hold  promise  for  the  future.  A  highly  visible  and
independent oversight activity will be identified. An annual interagency program re-
view  with  a  significant  external  (to  NOAA)  role  is  being  planned  with  the  Inter-
departmental  Hurricane  Conference,  as  a  possible  venue.  This  conference  leads  up
to  an  annual  summit  attended  by  agency,  academia,  and  private  sector  research
leadership.

NOAA is working with the NSF to formally establish the National Hurricane Re-
search  Alliance  to  ensure  coordination  across  the  broad  spectrum  of  activities  from
observations  to  data  assimilation  to  modeling  to  basic  research.  The  Alliance  will
include  key  federal  agencies,  including  NSF,  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space
Administration (NASA), and the Navy (including the Office of Naval Research). This
Alliance will leverage existing federal hurricane coordination efforts, including those
from the OFCM Services and Supporting Research, to manage overall roles and re-
sponsibilities  to  improve  overall  accuracy  and  reliability  of  hurricane  forecasts.
Through  this  Alliance,  NOAA  and  NSF  will  work  with  other  federal  agencies  to
maximize  the  use  of  the  considerable  non-federal  assets  in  conducting  much  of  the
hurricane  research  and  development  described  in  the  National  Hurricane  Research
Initiative  Act  of  2007,  and  in  developing  and  disseminating  related  products  and
services.

Federal Investments

NOAA  needs  to  ensure  new  breakthroughs  in  hurricane  research  and  technology
can be accelerated into operational forecasting systems. The importance of address-
ing operational forecast requirements and related research focus areas requires suf-
ficient investments that include:

• Easy access to current and planned observing systems;
• Increased  high  performance  computing  capacity  and  capability  to  allow  for

higher resolution models;

• Institutionalized  and  transition  research  to  operations  to  ensure  an  efficient
process to incorporate demonstrated research results in modeling and observ-
ing systems;

• A plan for sufficient operations and maintenance resources; and
• Enhanced  interactions  with  the  broader  science  and  engineering  community
to provide increased understanding of hurricanes while using all available re-
sources.

Therefore,  a  sustained  and  broad  hurricane  research  initiative  would  make  the
best  use  of  these  capabilities  and  improve  our  understanding  of  and  ability  to  pre-
dict hurricanes.

Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project (HFIP)

NOAA established the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project (HFIP) to develop
a unified 10-year plan to improve our one to five day tropical cyclone forecasts, with
an emphasis on rapid intensity change. The goal of HFIP is to improve the accuracy
and  reliability  of  hurricane  forecasts  and  warnings  and  to  increase  the  confidence
in  those  forecasts  to  enhance  mitigation  and  preparedness  decisions  by  emergency
management officials at all levels of government and by individuals.

The  scope  of  the  HFIP  plan  (Figure  2)  encompasses  research  and  development:
• To  improve  understanding,  with  emphasis  on  the  phenomena  related  to  pre-

dictability of rapid intensity8 change and secondary eyewall phenomena;

its environment;

• To  improve  observations  and  observational  strategies  for  the  hurricane  and
• To  uncover  novel  methods  for  data  assimilation,  to  utilize  the  diverse  range
• To  advance  high-resolution  numerical  prediction  and  ensemble  predictions
• To accelerate the transfer of research results into operational forecasting.

systems for hurricane forecast guidance; and

of existing and new observations;

While  NOAA  is  developing  its  level  of  involvement  in  the  broader  spectrum  of
issues identified in the NSB report, NOAA focused HFIP on the research and devel-
opment  issues  identified  by  operational  needs  that  will  lead  to  improved  hurricane
forecast  guidance  and  tools.  HFIP  aims  to  reduce  and  quantify  the  uncertainty  in
all forecast guidance, including high spatial/temporal resolution gridded wind speed,
precipitation,  storm  surge  analysis  and  forecast  information.  Our  efforts  will  focus
on  improved  track  forecasts,  improved  intensity  forecasts,  improved  rapid  intensity
change forecasts, and improved lead time.
Below are four examples of our metrics:

8 Rapid intensification is defined at a 30kt increase of sustained maximum winds in 24 hours

or less.

1) Reduce  average  track  error  by  50  percent  for  Days  1  through  5  (Figure

3)
Based on input from emergency managers at all levels, the forecast of the location
or  track  of  the  tropical  cyclone  is  most  important.  Over  the  past  couple  of  decades
the hurricane community has put most of its effort and resources into reducing the
track  error.  While  the  limits  of  predictability  for  track  error  are  not  fully  under-
stood, NOAA will seek to reduce the track error by 50 percent over the next decade,
which is the same level of improvement as NOAA was able to achieve between 1990
and  the  present.  More  accurate  information  on  the  location  of  the  storm  will  allow
emergency  managers  to  focus  on  a  more  precise  coastal  area  at  landfall  and  avoid
unnecessary evacuations.
2) Extend the lead time for hurricane forecasts out to Day 7 (Figure 4)

In  2001  the  NHC  extended  the  lead  time  of  its  forecasts  from  three  to  five  days.
However  State  and  federal  emergency  managers  have  expressed  that  five  days  is
not enough time to prepare certain areas, due to population growth, infrastructure,
resources,  etc.  Extending  the  forecast  out  to  seven  days  would  help  address  their
concern  and  need  for  longer  lead  times  to  ensure  those  impacted  (the  public,  busi-
nesses, etc.) have sufficient time to prepare for, and evacuate from, an approaching
hurricane.
3) Reduce average intensity error by 50 percent for Days 1 through 5 (Fig-

ure 5)
The  current  hurricane  48-hour  official  forecast  intensity  error  is  ∼14  knots  or
roughly  the  wind  speed  range  for  one  category  on  the  Saffir-Simpson  Hurricane
Scale. Due to the uncertainty in today’s intensity (strength of storm) forecast, NHC
suggests that emergency managers prepare for one category above the NHC official
intensity  forecast  (e.g.,  if  NHC  forecasts  a  Category  3  hurricane  at  landfall,  emer-
gency  managers  should  prepare  for  a  Category  4).  A  50  percent  reduction  in  inten-
sity error will allow emergency managers to better focus their preparedness efforts.
Reducing the uncertainty in the hurricane intensity forecasts will also support evac-
uation  decisions  by  identifying  the  coastal  and  inland  areas  of  greatest  concern  for
wind and associated storm surge.

When  the  impacts  of  the  50  percent  improvement  in  track  and  intensity  errors
are combined for the Gulf Coast, forecasts provided to the emergency managers will
be  a  more  confined  area  of  concern  with  a  more  precise  wind  estimate  (Figure  5).
4) Increase the accuracy of rapid intensity change forecasts

Rapid intensity change presents a great challenge to hurricane forecasters during
the  life  of  a  storm  and  a  serious  problem  for  emergency  managers  when  it  occurs
just prior to landfall. Rapid intensity events constitute an approximate two-category
change  within  one  day,  and  have  a  significant  impact  on  preparedness  and  evacu-
ation actions for emergency managers.

While  improving  the  accuracy  of  rapid  intensity  change  forecasts  within  one  day
of landfall is a high priority, given the uncertainty in track forecasts of landfall and
the need by some to make decisions on protective actions more than one day before
landfall, these improvements are needed at all lead times over the entire life of the
storm. Increasing the forecast accuracy of rapid intensity change events can lead to
greater  confidence  in  forecasts.  Emergency  managers  and  the  public  will  be  able  to
make decisions and take appropriate action. Today, emergency planning is based on
a  storm  one  category  higher  than  what  is  predicted.  More  accurate  rapid  intensity
change predictions, will allow for more efficient evacuations and preparedness.

Key Strategies for HFIP

I  will  now  briefly  describe  key  strategies  outlined  in  our  Hurricane  Forecast  Im-
provement  Project  plan  to  implement  the  activities  needed  to  improve  hurricane
forecasts,  with  an  emphasis  on  rapid  intensity  change.  Full  HFIP  details  are  avail-
able at http://www.nrc.noaa.gov/plans¥docs/HFIP¥Draft¥Plan-1.pdf.
Engage  the  expertise  of  the  operational  tropical/hurricane  numerical  pre-
diction and research community, including stakeholders

NOAA  recognizes  the  broad  scope  of  the  scientific  challenges  associated  with  un-
derstanding  and  predicting  hurricanes.  Addressing  these  challenges  and  improving
forecasts of hurricane track and intensity will involve increased interaction with the
external  research  community  to  leverage  and  coordinate  research  activities.  NOAA
plans to broaden the base of expertise in the tropical cyclone operational numerical
prediction and research communities and broaden our interaction with the research

and development community by improving our efforts through workshops, symposia,
and conferences to:

• Improve computer modeling of hurricanes;
• Improve the use of data;
• Better  coordinate  with  our  federal,  academic,  and  private  sector  partners  of
• Increase grants; and
• Support additional education and outreach activities.

needs and opportunities;

Optimize observing systems for research and operations

The  advancement  of  observational  capabilities  for  tropical  cyclone  analysis,  fore-
casting,  and  numerical  weather  prediction  is  a  vital  component  of  the  HFIP.  These
observational capabilities extend from exploratory scientific research conducted with
new  types  and  new  generations  of  advanced  instruments  and  platforms,  to  proven
operational  systems  used  for  analysis  and  forecasting.  Over  the  past  four  decades,
satellite  and  airborne  observing  systems  developed  and  flown  by  NASA,  NOAA,
NSF,  and  the  Department  of  Defense  have  made  major  contributions  to  the  oper-
ational  tropical  cyclone  forecast  systems.  With  several  new  observational  platforms
and  sensors  meant  to  enhance  observing  capabilities  for  hurricane  forecasters,  and
hurricane  numerical  prediction  systems  potentially  available  in  the  next  several
years,  NOAA  will  evaluate  the  usefulness  of  these  data  to  ensure  investment  deci-
sions  are  made  to  select  the  optimal  systems/platforms  for  improvements  in  hurri-
cane forecasts.
Define  and  build  the  next  generation  hurricane  forecast  framework,  in-
cluding the Hurricane Forecast System/Global Forecast System

The  next  generation  hurricane  forecast  framework  is  a  multi-model  suite  con-
taining  both  high  resolution  and  ensemble  forecasts  produced  by  NOAA  and  other
numerical  prediction  entities  on  the  national  and  international  scales.  Within  this
framework,  a  next-generation  Hurricane  Forecast  System/Global  Forecast  System
will  also  be  defined  and  constructed  to  accurately  represent  the  physical  processes
responsible  for  rapid  intensity  change  through  research  and  development  activities
within  NOAA  and  the  broader  research  community.  This  strategy  builds  upon
NOAA’s  long-standing  operational  numerical  prediction  capabilities  and  related  re-
search efforts to improve understanding of the physical processes that lead to track,
intensity/structure,  and  precipitation  changes  in  hurricanes.  This  plan  focuses  on
developing  a  capability  to  accelerate  numerical  modeling  developments  to  drive  im-
provements  in  the  hurricane  forecast  guidance  through  enhanced  research  between
NOAA and the larger research community.

The  need  for  an  ensemble  approach  for  all  forecast  applications,  including  hurri-
cane forecasting, was highlighted by a 2006 National Research Council Report.9 The
report  states,  as  one  of  their  nine  major  recommendations,  ‘‘NOAA  should  develop
and maintain the ability to produce objective uncertainty information from the glob-
al to the regional scale.’’
Institutionalize and transition research to operations

The  transition  of  research  to  operations—referred  to  by  the  OFCM  and  defined
by  the  Board  on  Atmospheric  Sciences  and  Climate,  National  Research  Council  as
‘‘bridging the valley of death’’—requires robust interaction between the research and
operational  communities,  as  well  as  a  strong  interface  with  the  user  community.
Also required is a healthy infrastructure for the transition, including resources and
processes  for  evaluation  and  demonstration,  operational  implementation  and  oper-
ations and maintenance.
Increase High Performance Computing and Information Technology capac-
ity and capability

High  quality  hurricane  forecasting  will  require  a  5000  fold  increase  in  high  per-
formance computing and information technology capabilities. The framework of com-
bining information from different forecast centers involves virtual grid computing as
the  system  leverages  and  relies  on  computing  capability  across  the  numerical  pre-
diction  centers,  but  may  also  require  significant  enhancements  in  telecommuni-
cation.  In  addition,  each  center,  including  the  NOAA  computing  centers,  will

produce  higher-resolution  analyses  and  forecasts  by  running  the  numerical  models
on  massively  parallel  processors,  including  NOAA’s  supercomputer.  Therefore,  in-
creases in NOAA’s high performance computing capability and capacity are required
to enable and support advancements in the NOAA Hurricane Forecast System/Glob-
al Forecast System, including ensemble capabilities.

Conclusion

NOAA  applauds  the  Committee’s  broad  perspective  of  hurricane  impacts  and  the
need for research in areas including storm structure, rapid intensity change, ocean-
atmosphere  interactions,  storm  surge,  rainfall  and  inland  flooding  forecasts.  How-
ever,  the  Administration  is  concerned  that  the  bill’s  funding  levels  are  significantly
higher than current funding levels. NOAA’s HFIP already addresses a path forward
for many of the items outlined in the National Hurricane Research Initiative Act of
2007. HFIP efforts are currently focused on improved track and intensity forecasts,
wind fields, and storm surge, as well as the accompanying need for improved obser-
vations and computing capability. We agree the most effective role is for NOAA and
NSF  to  co-chair  a  committee  to  oversee  and  coordinate  federally  funded  hurricane
research  efforts  to  ensure  successful  work  can  be  incorporated  into  the  operational
forecast and warning environment with the overall goal of improved hurricane fore-
casts  and  services.  The  key  to  success  in  improving  hurricane  prediction  is
leveraging  all  available  national  assets  and  capabilities  to  address  this  national
need.  I  thank  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  about  this  challenge  and
we  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Committee  as  this  legislation  moves  forward.

The National Weather Service (NWS) provides daily weather forecasts and warn-
ings  to  the  American  media,  emergency  managers,  fire  land  managers,  commercial
weather  partners,  and  the  general  public  for  weather  and  natural  hazards  such  as
hurricanes,  tornadoes,  severe  thunderstorms,  flash  floods,  winter  storms,  extreme
fire weather conditions, tsunamis, and solar flares.

Dr.  Hayes  rejoined  the  National  Weather  Service  after  serving  as  the  Director  of
the  World  Weather  Watch  Department  at  the  World  Meteorological  Organization
(WMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations located in Geneva, Switzerland.
In  that  position,  he  was  responsible  for  the  global  observing,  global  telecommuni-
cations, and global data processing and forecasting systems that provide the founda-
tion for operational weather forecasting and warning services for 188 WMO member
countries  worldwide.  During  this  period,  he  led  the  development  of  the  WMO  Stra-
tegic Plan which was approved by WMO’s 15th Congress in May 2007.

Before joining the WMO, he served in several senior executive positions at NOAA.
As  the  Deputy  Assistant  Administrator  for  NOAA  Research,  he  was  responsible  for
the  management  of  research  programs.  As  Deputy  Assistant  Administrator  of  the
National  Ocean  Service  (NOS),  he  was  the  chief  operating  officer  dealing  with  a
multitude  of  ocean  and  coastal  challenges,  including  NOS’s  response  to  the  Hurri-
cane  Katrina  disaster  in  August  2005.  As  Director  of  Office  of  Science  and  Tech-
nology  for  the  NWS,  he  was  responsible  for  the  infusion  of  new  science  and  tech-
nology essential to weather service operations; he was recognized as one of the Fed-
eral Government’s Top 100 IT Executives for his leadership of programs to improve
information  processing  and  dissemination  supporting  NWS’s  weather  forecast  and
warning mission.

Dr.  Hayes  was  also  an  executive  in  the  private  sector  and  the  military.  He  was
general  manager  of  the  $500  million  Automated  Weather  Interactive  Processing
System  program  at  Litton-PRC  from  1998  through  2000.  AWIPS  is  the  interactive
computer  system  utilized  by  all  weather  service  forecasters.  From  1970  through
1998, he held a variety of meteorological positions with the United States Air Force,
beginning as a weather forecast officer in 1970 and culminating his career as Com-
mander of the Air Force Weather Agency and Air Force Global Weather Center.

He received both his Ph.D. and Master of Science degrees in meteorology from the
Naval  Postgraduate  School  in  Monterey,  California.  He  is  a  graduate  of  Bowling
Green  State  University,  with  a  Bachelor’s  degree  in  mathematics.  He  is  a  Fellow
in the American Meteorological Society.

Florida actually, is my fellow NSB member and also was the other
Co-Chair.

You  have  heard  a  lot  of  statistics  this  morning,  but  I  would  like
to highlight one area of vulnerability for our nation that is particu-
larly relevant today, and that is the immense energy infrastructure
in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  That  infrastructure  transports  some  30  per-
cent of our nation’s domestically-produced oil and gas from offshore
wells to onshore refineries, and more than 100 of the 4,000 offshore
platforms  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  were  destroyed  in  Hurricanes
Katrina  and  Rita  alone.  And  a  full  nine  months  later  150  million
barrels  of  oil  and  730  billion  cubic  feet  of  gas  remain  unavailable
to our nation.

Motivated in part by the sorts of vulnerabilities I just mentioned,
the  National  Science  Board  undertook  a  very  intensive  effort  to
frame  the  hurricane  science  and  engineering  research  challenges
and  recommend  a  national  imperative  to  address  them.  The  most
important aspect of this strategy is that it engages not only the at-
mospheric  sciences  but  also  disciplines  such  as  engineering,  social
and  behavioral  sciences,  economics,  computer  science,  ecology,  and
hydrology in a truly integrated fashion.

We  often  tend  to  think  of  hurricanes  as  a  weather  problem,  but
in  reality  they  are  a  weather-driven,  social  science,  human  behav-
ior, physical science and engineering problem as Dr. Baird correctly
mentioned a few moments ago. The recommendations of the Board
report  strongly  reflected  H.R.  2407,  and  for  that  we  owe  all  of  you
a debt of gratitude.

You  might  ask  where  are  we  today.  As  the  Nation’s  principle
agency for funding basic science and engineering research and edu-
cation, the National Science Foundation’s support for hurricane-re-
lated research in fiscal 2007, was $12.44 million across all the topic
areas outlined in H.R. 2407. NSF awarded 106 small grants for ex-
ploratory  research  related  to  Hurricane  Katrina  alone,  and  the
total budgets of those grants were about $7.5 million.

NSF has long been an active participant in the U.S. Weather Re-
search  Program,  which  focuses  on  the  physics  of  hurricanes  and
their  prediction.  NSF  and  NOAA,  the  two  lead  agencies  in  H.R.
2407,  already  collaborate  in  many  ways,  and  a  wonderful  example
of  that  with  regard  to  hurricanes  is  a  new  joint  research  solicita-
tion  on  the  topic  of  communicating  hurricane  information.  It  fo-
cuses  on  the  important  social  science  problem  of  how  warning  in-
formation is communicated, interpreted, and then acted upon.

H.R.  2407  provides  an  opportunity  to  coordinate  and  enhance
that  type  of  research  along  with  physical  science  and  engineering
research  in  a  truly  integrative  manner,  which  is  truly  the  nec-
essary  path  forward  if  we  hope  to  improve  our  nation’s  resilience
and resistance.

Additional  opportunities  in  the  National  Science  Board  report
that are worth mentioning this morning include the use of National
Super  Computing  Centers  funded  by  NSF  for  running  operational
NOAA forecast models in time of national need; in fact other mod-
els  as  well—as  well  as  exploring  university  curricula  that  look  at
hurricanes  not  just  from  an  atmospheric  scientist’s  point  of  view
but  from  a  multi-disciplinary  perspective  to  make  sure  that  our
next generation of hurricane researchers is adequately educated.

In  closing,  I  would  like  to  note  that  the  NSB  report  on  which
H.R.  2407  is  based,  I  have  a  copy  here,  the  title  says,  Hurricane
Warning,  and  it  truly  is  an  urgent  call  to  action  on  a  very,  very
important  challenge  for  our  nation.  On  behalf  of  the  National
Science  Board  and  our  Chairman,  Dr.  Steven  Beering,  I  want  to
thank  the  Science  Committee  and  the  two  Subcommittees  who
sponsored  this  hearing  for  recognizing  urgency  of  this  important
topic.  We  at  the  National  Science  Board  stand  ready  to  assist  you
in whatever ways might be most beneficial.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF KELVIN K. DROEGEMEIER

I thank Chairman Lampson, Chairman Baird, Ranking Members Ehlers and Ing-
lis,  and  the  other  Members  of  the  two  Subcommittees  for  the  opportunity  to  speak
with  you  today.  My  name  is  Kelvin  Droegemeier  and  I  am  a  Professor  of  Meteor-
ology  at  the  University  of  Oklahoma.  I  also  am  a  member  of  the  National  Science
Board  and  am  appearing  before  you  today  in  my  role  as  Co-Chair  of  the  National
Science Board’s Task Force on Hurricane Science and Engineering. The final report
of  this  Task  Force  was  published  on  January  12,  2007,  and  I  understand  that  it
largely  served  as  the  blueprint  for  H.R.  2407  as  introduced  in  the  House  of  Rep-
resentatives.  Dr.  Kenneth  Ford,  Director  of  the  Institute  for  Human  and  Machine
Cognition and fellow NSB member, served as my Co-Chair.

I  needn’t  tell  you  that  every  year,  hurricanes  pose  a  threat  to  life,  property,  and
the  very  economic  vitality  of  our  nation.  Yet  impact  of  hurricanes  extends  well  be-
yond  a  given  storm,  often  for  many  years,  as  we’ve  seen  in  recent  storms  such  as
Katrina  and  Rita.  Among  all  weather  hazards  in  the  U.S.,  hurricanes  account  for
over  half  the  total  damage  inflicted,  and  annual  economic  losses  average  approxi-
mately  $10  billion  in  constant  2006  dollars.  Of  course,  the  2005  hurricane  season
was notably destructive, with Katrina losses exceeding $130 billion. Remarkably, 50
percent  of  the  U.S.  population  lives  within  50  miles  of  a  coastline  and  that  some
80  percent  of  our  population  resides  within  200  miles  of  a  coast.  The  $3  trillion  of
physical  infrastructure  in  the  Gulf  and  Atlantic  coastal  regions  continues  to  grow
at a rapid pace, and thus we as a nation are increasingly vulnerable to hurricanes.
Of particular relevance today is the immense energy infrastructure located in ‘‘hur-
ricane  alley’’—33,000  miles  of  pipeline  that  transports  some  30  percent  of  our  na-
tion’s  domestically-produced  oil  and  gas  from  offshore  wells  to  onshore  refineries.
According  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Interior,  some  3,000  of  the  Gulf’s  4,000
platforms, and 22,000 of the 33,000 miles of the Gulf’s pipelines, were in the direct
paths  of  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita.  A  total  of  115  offshore  platforms  were  de-
stroyed,  52  were  damaged,  and  535  pipeline  segments  were  damaged.  Considerable
destruction occurred to onshore facilities—for example, refineries and supporting in-
frastructures in and around Lake Charles, Louisiana. More than nine months later,
22  percent  of  federal  oil  production  and  13  percent  of  natural  gas  production  re-
mained unavailable, resulting in the loss of 150 million barrels of oil and 730 billion
cubic feet of gas from domestic supplies.

Motivated in part by recent hurricanes, the National Science Board decided to un-
dertake an intensive effort to frame the hurricane science and engineering research
challenges and recommend a national imperative to address them in a holistic man-
ner.  We  did  so  by  engaging  the  academic,  government  and  private  sector  commu-
nities  in  a  series  of  workshops;  by  evaluating  previous  studies  of  hurricanes  and
other  natural  disasters;  and  by  obtaining  input  from  the  public  on  a  draft  version
of the report.

As you well know, we spend billions of dollars on rescue and recovery after hurri-
canes  occur.  But  can  we  better  anticipate  and  react  to  hurricanes  ahead  of  time  to
avoid  loss  of  life,  property,  vital  infrastructures,  and  disruptions  in  our  economy?
The answer from our study is yes. Are we using existing knowledge effectively? The
answer from our study is no. Is the research now being done adequate and properly
coordinated?  The  answer  from  our  study  is  no.  In  fact,  research  in  hurricanes  ap-
pears  to  be  a  modest,  loosely  coordinated  enterprise.  Although  of  high  quality,  this
research  is  generally  conducted  within  the  boundaries  of  traditional  disciplines—
stovepipes like meteorology, hydrology, engineering, computer science and ecology—
with  insufficient  integration.  And  the  engagement  of  social,  economic,  behavioral
sciences  is  inadequate.  In  short,  the  hurricane  is  perhaps  one  of  the  best  examples

of a problem—vital to society—which must be studied in a multi-disciplinary fashion
if we hope to lessen our vulnerability.

H.R.  2407  reflects  very  closely  the  recommendations  made  in  our  report.  This
truly  is  a  wonderful  testimony  of  Congress  responding  quickly  to  recommendations
of the broad community and using existing frameworks (such as OSTP and the Na-
tional  Windstorm  Impact  Reduction  Act)  to  deal  with  a  profoundly  important  prob-
lem.  Given  that  you  are  familiar  with  the  bill,  I  wish  to  highlight  just  a  few  key
points.

First,  strong  collaboration  between  NSF  and  NOAA  is  vital  to  the  success  of  this
effort,  as  is  the  involvement  of  other  agencies,  as  articulated  in  the  bill.  Second,  it
is  important  to  note  that  the  hurricane  is  not  a  weather  problem  alone  but  rather
a  weather-driven  problem  that  must  be  studied  in  a  multi-disciplinary  fashion.  It
is for this reason that the components of the research agenda described in the bill—
including,  for  example,  hurricane  intensity  change,  assessment  and  response  of
structures  to  wind  and  waves,  ecosystem  impacts,  and  economic  and  societal  im-
pacts—are  important  and  must  be  performed  in  a  coordinated  manner.  Third,  the
national infrastructure data base is important for hurricanes but also for numerous
other  uses,  ranging  from  earthquakes  to  homeland  security.  Fourth,  the  National
Hurricane  Research  Model—which  in  our  report  was  referred  to  as  a  testbed  and
involves  all  relevant  disciplines  of  the  research  program—is  essential  for  bringing
together the research components and moving them to operational practice.

On  behalf  of  the  National  Science  Board  and  our  Chairman,  Dr.  Steven  Beering,
I  want  to  thank  the  Subcommittees  for  the  important  work  they  do  for  U.S.  sci-
entific  research,  education,  and  training.  We  appreciate  your  attention  to  the  rec-
ommendations  of  the  Board  and  stand  ready  to  assist  in  whatever  ways  might  be
most beneficial.

BIOGRAPHY FOR KELVIN K. DROEGEMEIER

Kelvin  K.  Droegemeier  earned  a  B.S.  with  Special  Distinction  in  Meteorology  in
1980 from the University of Oklahoma, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in atmospheric
science  in  1982  and  1985,  respectively,  from  the  University  of  Illinois  at  Urbana–
Champaign under the direction of R. Wilhelmson. He joined the University of Okla-
homa in September, 1985 as an Assistant Professor of Meteorology, and was tenured
and  promoted  to  Associate  Professor  in  July,  1991,  and  promoted  to  Professor  in
July,  1998.  Dr.  Droegemeier  was  co-founder  in  1989  of  the  NSF  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Center  (STC)  for  Analysis  and  Prediction  of  Storms  (CAPS),  and  served  for
five years as its Deputy Director. He then directed CAPS from 1994 until 2006, and
today CAPS is recognized around the world as the pioneer of storm-scale numerical
weather  prediction.  Dr.  Droegemeier  is  now  Director  Emeritus  of  CAPS.  In  1998,
Dr.  Droegemeier  was  named  a  President’s  Associates  Presidential  Professor  at  the
University  of  Oklahoma,  and  for  two  years,  beginning  in  summer  1999,  wrote  a
daily  weather  science  column  for  the  Daily  Oklahoman  newspaper,  which  is  Okla-
homa’s largest. He was awarded a Regents’ Professorship at OU in fall, 2001, which
is  a  life-long  title.  In  2003,  Dr.  Droegemeier  co-founded  the  NSF  Engineering  Re-
search  Center  for  Collaborative  Adaptive  Sensing  of  the  Atmosphere  (CASA)  and
currently serves as its Deputy Director. He is the only person in the Nation to have
co-founded  an  NSF  Science  and  Technology  Center  and  an  NSF  Engineering  Re-
search  Center.  In  2004,  he  was  awarded  the  Roger  and  Sherry  Teigen  Presidential
Professorship and became the first OU professor to receive two Presidential Profes-
sorships.  In  2005,  he  was  named  the  Weathernews  Chair  in  Applied  Meteorology
at the University of Oklahoma and also the Director of the Sasaki Institute, a non-
profit  organization  that  fosters  the  development  and  application  of  knowledge,  pol-
icy,  and  advanced  technology  in  the  government,  academic  and  private  sectors.  In
2004,  Dr.  Droegemeier  was  appointed  by  President  George  W.  Bush  to  a  six-year
term  on  the  National  Science  Board,  the  governing  body  of  the  National  Science
Foundation  that  also  provides  science  policy  guidance  to  the  Congress  and  Presi-
dent. In 2005, Dr. Droegemeier was appointed Associate Vice President for Research
at the University of Oklahoma.

In  1987,  Dr.  Droegemeier  was  named  a  Presidential  Young  Investigator  by  the
National  Science  Foundation.  As  Director  of  the  CAPS  model  development  project
for five years, he managed the creation of a multi-scale numerical prediction system
that  has  helped  pioneer  the  science  of  storm-scale  numerical  forecasting.  This  com-
puter model was a finalist for the 1993 National Gordon Bell Prize in High Perform-
ance  Computing.  In  1997,  Dr.  Droegemeier  received  the  Discover  Magazine  Award
for Technology Innovation (computer software category), and also in 1997 CAPS was

Dr.  Droegemeier  has  been  a  major  force  behind  the  development  and  application
of high performance computing systems both at OU and across the U.S. In 1989 and
1990,  he  chaired  the  OU  Computing  Advisory  Committee  and  was  the  lead  author
on  a  five-year  strategic  plan.  He  has  served  on  numerous  NSF  High  Performance
Computing and Communication panels and is a member of the NCSA User Advisory
Committee.  In  1995  he  created  as  principal  investigator,  and  now  directs,  a  $1.4
million  NSF/OU  project  known  as  the  Environmental  Computing  Applications  Sys-
tem.  He  served  on  the  National  Science  Foundation’s  Blue  Ribbon  Panel  on
Cyberinfrastructure,  and  is  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  OU  Super-
computer  Center  for  Education  and  Research  (OSCER),  which  he  helped  establish.
Dr. Droegemeier is now a member of the Advisory Committee for the National Cen-
ter for Computational Sciences and the Computer Science and Math Division at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory.

Dr.  Droegemeier  is  a  national  leader  in  the  creation  of  partnerships  among  aca-
demia,  government  and  industry.  He  initiated  and  led  a  three-year,  $1M  partner-
ship with American Airlines to customize weather prediction technology for commer-
cial  aviation,  and  this  resulted  in  him  founding  a  private  company,  Weather  Deci-
sion Technologies, Inc., located in Norman, that is commercializing advanced weath-
er technology developed by the University of Oklahoma and other organizations. The
success with American Airlines also played a role in the establishment in Oklahoma
of the Aviation Services Division of Weathernews, the world’s largest private weath-
er  company.  Dr.  Droegemeier  led  a  $10.6M  research  alliance  with  Williams  Energy
Marketing  and  Trading  Company  in  Tulsa,  which  is  the  largest  such  partnership
between a university and a private company in the field of meteorology. He initiated
and  led  the  Collaborative  Radar  Acquisition  Field  Test  (CRAFT),  a  national  project
directed  toward  developing  strategies  for  the  real  time  delivery  of  NEXRAD  radar
data  via  the  Internet.  CRAFT  won  two  awards  from  the  National  Oceanic  and  At-
mospheric  Administration,  and  its  success  led  the  National  Weather  Service  to
adopt its Internet data delivery strategy. As a follow-on to CRAFT, Droegemeier es-
tablished  Integrated  Radar  Data  Services  (IRaDS)  at  OU,  which  is  a  National
Weather Service-designed top-tier provider of NEXRAD radar data to private indus-
try.

Dr.  Droegemeier’s  research  interests  lie  in  thunderstorm  dynamics  and  predict-
ability,  variational  data  assimilation,  mesoscale  dynamics,  computational  fluid  dy-
namics,  massively  parallel  computing,  and  aviation  weather.  He  has  served  as  an
associate editor for Monthly Weather Review for six years served on the UCAR Uni-
versity  Relations  Committee,  the  last  two  as  Chair.  Elected  to  the  UCAR  Board  of
Trustees  in  2002  and  as  its  Vice  Chairman  in  2003,  he  became  Chairman  of  the
Board  in  2004.  Dr.  Droegemeier  has  served  as  a  consultant  to  Honeywell  Corpora-
tion,  American  Airlines,  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board,  and  Climato-
logical  Consulting  Corp.  Dr.  Droegemeier  has  graduated  27  students  and  served  on
the  committees  of  numerous  others.  He  has  served  on  the  Advisory  Committee  for
the Geosciences Directorate at the National Science Foundation and the NSF Advi-
sory Committee for the Computer Information Science and Engineering Directorate.
In  his  23  years  at  the  University  of  Oklahoma,  Dr.  Droegemeier  has  generated
over $40 million in external research funding. For over a decade, he has been among
the top five faculty at the University of Oklahoma in external research grant fund-
ing, averaging over $2 million per year. Dr. Droegemeier has been an invited speak-
er at or organizer of several international conferences and symposia on meteorology,
high-performance  computing,  and  computational  fluid  dynamics  in  the  U.S.,  Eng-
land,  Japan,  Australia,  Korea,  and  France,  notably  the  series  of  Joint  US-Korea
Workshops on Storm and Mesoscale Weather Analysis and Prediction, which he ini-
tiated  in  the  mid  1990s.  He  has  authored  and  co-authored  more  than  60  refereed
journal articles and over 200 conference publications, and is a former Vice President
of  the  Central  Oklahoma  Chapters  of  the  American  Meteorological  Society  and  Na-
tional Weather Association. He is a former Member of the Board of Directors of the
Norman,  OK  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  chaired  the  Weather  and  Climate  Team
for  Governor  Brad  Henry’s  EDGE  (Economic  Development  Generating  Excellence)
Program.  He  is  a  Fellow  of  the  American  Meteorological  Society,  and  served  as  a
Counselor from 2005–2008.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  SHUYI  S.  CHEN,  PROFESSOR  OF  METEOR-
OLOGY  AND  PHYSICAL  OCEANOGRAPHY,  ROSENSTIEL
SCHOOL  OF  MARINE  AND  ATMOSPHERIC  SCIENCES,  UNI-
VERSITY OF MIAMI
Dr. CHEN. Chairman Baird, Chairman Lampson, and Members of
the  two  Subcommittees,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak
with  you  today  on  the  need  for  advancing  hurricane  research.  My
name  is  Shuyi  Chen.  I  am  a  Professor  at  Rosenstiel  School  of  Ma-
rine and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Miami. It is an
honor  for  me  to  testify  on  the  National  Hurricane  Research  Initia-
tive.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  Congressman  Hastings  and  Con-
gresswomen  Ros-Lehtinen  for  their  leadership  in  introducing  H.R.
2407.

The  U.S.  has  become  increasingly  vulnerable  to  hurricanes,  not
only because of the uncertainty of hurricane response to a warming
climate,  but  also  rapid  growth  of  coastal  population.  The  average
annual  cost  for  hurricane-related  losses  have  increased  to  more
than ten billion, not to mention the loss of life and human suffering
as seen in the case of Katrina.

As  a  scientist  it  was  particularly  devastating  and  heartbreaking
for  me  to  watch  the  disaster  caused  by  Katrina,  the  2004  hurri-
canes in Florida, and the recent hurricanes worldwide. The time for
us  to  have  better  integrated  hurricane  forecasting  and  a  response
system is now, not some time in the future.

The  research  required  to  address  these  challenges  require  a
transformative  agenda  that  stimulates  new  directions  in  research
including a collaborative and multi-disciplinary approach. The pre-
diction  of  rapid  intensity-changing  hurricanes  has  been  stagnant
over the last fifteen years. We need new, truly integrated hurricane
forecasting  response  system.  This  is  outlined  in  the  written  testi-
mony.

At  the  center  of  this  integrated  system  are  accurate  forecasts  of
extreme  wind,  rain,  storm  surge,  severe  weather,  floods,  at  and
after  landfall,  and  the  seamless  information  flow  from  forecasts  to
risk  assessment,  emergency  response,  and  ultimately  mitigation  of
hurricane  damage.  Universities  will  play  a  critical  role  in  building
the  integrated  system,  not  only  providing  the  basic  research  in
science  and  technology  but  also  training  the  next  generation  sci-
entists,  engineers,  forecasters,  and  government  managers  with
fresh  knowledge  of  innovative  tools  for  hurricane  prediction  and
impact mitigation.

These  young  people  will  continue  the  effort  to  improve  the  sys-
tem  into  the  future.  We  are  confident  that  with  the  requests  and
support,  the  research  community  will  meet  the  scientific  and  engi-
neering  challenges  in  collaboration  with  the  government  agency.
We will develop and implement such an integrated system of oper-
ations in the coming decade.

It  is  impossible  to  put  a  price  tag  on  the  value  of  such  a  chal-
lenging  problem  facing  the  Nation.  The  investment  we  needed  to
make  to  build  the  integrated  system  is  a  cost-effective  approach.
The  request  investment  is  dwarfed  by  the  cost  of  a  single  disaster
like  in  Katrina,  which  was  more  than  130  billion  and  unnecessary
loss of life.

H.R.  2407  represents  a  cost-effective  investment  that  will  help
prepare  the  Nation  to  deal  with  the  future  disaster  like  Katrina.
It  is  overall  a  preventative  plan  for  saving  lives  and  reducing  eco-
nomic  losses  that  would  occur  in  many  hurricanes  we  can  expect
in the coming decades.

In  conclusion,  improving  hurricane  forecasts  and  response  to
save  lives  and  reduce  economic  losses  must  be  a  national  priority.
The  investment  in  science  and  technology  gives  us  an  unprece-
dented  capacity  and  opportunity  to  develop  an  integrated  system
that  will  support  risk  assessment,  emergency  management  by  re-
ducing  warning  areas  and  providing  forecasts  with  longer  lead
time. The legislation, H.R. 2407, if passed, will represent a real op-
portunity for the Nation to effectively meet the challenge before us.
I  urge  the  Committee  to  give  the  highest  priority  to  the  passage
of  the  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative  Act,  as  this  presents
an  excellent  plan  to  improve  hurricane  forecasts  that  will  ulti-
mately reduce hurricane damage.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SHUYI S. CHEN

Introduction

Chairman  Baird,  Chairman  Lampson,  and  Members  of  the  two  Subcommittees,
thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  you  today  on  the  need  for  advancing
hurricane research. My name is Shuyi Chen and I am a Professor at the Rosenstiel
School  of  Marine  and  Atmospheric  Science  at  the  University  of  Miami.  It  is  an
honor  for  me  to  testify  on  the  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative  Act  of  2007.
My research and professional service have centered on understanding and improv-
ing prediction of tropical weather systems, especially hurricanes. I served as an Edi-
tor for Weather and Forecasting of the American Meteorological Society from 2004–
2007.  I  currently  serve  on  the  American  Geophysical  Union  Committee  on  Cloud
and Precipitation and the National Science Foundation Science Steering Committee
on Coastal Ocean Processes. I lead a research group at the University of Miami that
has  developed  a  next-generation  high-resolution  coupled  atmosphere-wave-ocean
model to better understand hurricane structure and intensity and to improve hurri-
cane  prediction.  I  am  a  principal  investigator  for  two  recent  major  hurricane  re-
search  programs.  One  is  the  National  Science  Foundation  supported  Hurricane
Rainbands  and  Intensity  Change  Experiment  (RAINEX),  which  used  three  Doppler
radar aircraft and collected unprecedented in-situ data in Hurricanes Katrina, Rita,
and Ophelia during the 2005 Hurricane Season. The other is the Coupled Boundary
Layer  Air-Sea  Transfer  (CBLAST)–Hurricane  sponsored  by  the  Office  of  Naval  Re-
search, which aimed to better understand the role of air-sea interaction in hurricane
structure  and  intensity  change.  These  research  results  have  been  published  in
Science1 and  BAMS.2 Currently  I  am  a  lead  scientist  for  a  large  international  pro-
gram to study the tropical cyclones in the West Pacific.

The  U.S.  has  become  increasingly  vulnerable  to  hurricanes,  not  only  because  of
the  uncertainty  of  hurricane  response  to  a  warming  climate,  but  also  the  rapid
growth  of  the  coastal  population.  The  averaged  annual  cost  for  hurricane-related
losses  has  increased  to  more  than  $10  billion  in  recent  years,  not  to  mention  the
loss  of  life  and  human  suffering  as  seen,  for  example,  in  the  case  of  Hurricane
Katrina.  The  devastating  landfall  hurricane  events  in  2004–2005  have  led  to  four
major national reports calling for action to substantially improve hurricane forecasts

(AGU,3 NSB,4 NSAB,5 and OFCM6 ), particularly the rapid intensity change of hur-
ricanes  threatening  the  U.S.  Accurate  and  timely  forecasts  and  warnings  can  help
to  avoid  unnecessary  loss  of  life  and  reduce  economic  losses  related  to  land-falling
hurricanes.  Recent  advance  in  science  and  technology  gives  us  hope  for  optimism.
Meeting  the  challenges  put  forward  by  the  NSB,  AGU,  NSAB  and  OFCM  can  only
be  accomplished  through  fundamental  research  to  increase  our  understanding  of
hurricanes as an integrated science and engineering problem, and to use this under-
standing  to  improve  our  ability  to  predict  hurricanes,  mitigate  their  impacts,  and
react to an impending landfall.

The  key  to  success  is  development  of  an  integrated  hurricane  forecasting  system
that  substantially  improves  upon  the  current  1–5  day  forecasts  of  intensity  and
track,  and  extends  it  to  include  detailed  forecasts  of  extreme  winds,  rain,  storm
surge, and severe weather such as tornadoes and inland flooding, which are critical
for  emergency  response  to  hurricane  impacts.  There  is  also  a  need  to  extend  the
forecast  horizon  to  a  time  scale  of  weeks,  which  requires  making  probabilistic  fore-
casts  of  hurricane  genesis,  that  would  provide  extremely  valuable  for  emergency
planning  and  preparedness.  The  bill  H.R.  2407,  if  passed,  will  represent  a  real  op-
portunity  for  the  Nation  to  effectively  meet  the  challenge  before  us.  I  urge  that  the
Subcommittees give the highest priority to the passage of the H.R. 2407, as this pre-
sents  an  excellent  plan  for  improving  hurricane  forecasting  that  will  ultimately  re-
duce the damage of these dangerous storms.

Deficiencies in the Current Forecast System

Hurricane track forecasts and warnings have improved over the past 20 years due
mostly to improved computer models, global observations from satellites, and meth-
ods  of  assimilating  many  observations  into  models.  These  improvements  have  un-
doubtedly saved countless lives and billions of dollars in property damage. However,
hurricane  intensity  forecasts  have  shown  little  improvement.  The  lack  of  skill  in
present  forecasts  of  hurricane  structure  and  intensity,  especially  rapid  intensity
change, are attributed in part to deficiencies in the current prediction models: insuf-
ficient  grid  resolution,  inaccurate  model  physics,  lack  of  full  coupling  to  a  dynamic
ocean,  and  inadequate  observations  and  data  assimilation  of  hurricane  structures.
Current  operational  forecast  models  are  not  adequate  for  predicting  hurricane
wind  and  rain  structure  and  intensity  change,  as  highlighted  by  the  report  of  the
NOAA SAB Hurricane Intensity Research Working Group. Recent research results2
Chen  et  al.  (2007)  have  demonstrated  the  impact  of  increasing  model  grid  resolu-
tions on forecasting of hurricane structure and intensity change (Fig. 1). Clearly the
lower  resolution  models  are  incapable  of  predicting  critical  details  in  the  hurricane
core  region  controlling  the  rapid  intensification  of  a  hurricane.  A  research  experi-
ment carried out during RAINEX in Hurricane Katrina (Fig. 2) shows the potential
capability  of  high-resolution  models  in  forecasting  rapid  intensification.  The  re-
quired computer power increases by 5–10 times for each halving of the grid spacing,
so  this  requires  a  substantial  investment  in  high  performance  computing.  Moving
to  high  resolution  also  requires  an  investment  in  research  to  further  our  under-
standing and our ability of reproducing in forecast models the manner by which air-
sea interactions and cloud development are incorporated. Improvement in computer
models, high performance computers, innovative observations and data assimilation
of  the  hurricane  structure  will  have  to  be  achieved  in  concert  to  guarantee  sub-
stantive progress in predicting hurricane intensity change.

The Next-Generation Hurricane Forecast System

A  key  to  improving  forecast  of  hurricane  intensity  and  landfall  impact  is  to  de-
velop  computer  models  that  are  capable  of  resolving  the  inner  core  structures  (eye
and  eyewall)  and  rainbands  in  a  hurricane  and  realistically  representing  the  phys-
ical  processes  governing  rapid  intensity  change,  such  as  the  transfer  of  heat,  mois-
ture, and momentum at the air-sea interface and the phase changes of water vapor
in  the  atmosphere.  The  next-generation  prediction  models  must  be  able  to  resolve
features  on  a  horizontal  scale  of  ∼1  km  or  less  to  capture  the  gradients  across  the
eyewall boundaries and the interactions between the inner core and rainbands. Fur-
thermore,  the  intensification  and  decay  of  a  hurricane  largely  depends  upon  two
competing  processes  at  the  air-sea  interface:  1)  the  heat  and  moisture  fluxes  that
fuel  the  storm  and  2)  the  dissipation  of  kinetic  energy  associated  with  wind  stress
on  the  ocean  surface.  Figure  3  shows  an  example  of  the  high-resolution  coupled
models  developed  at  the  University  of  Miami  in  collaboration  with  NCAR  capable
of  capturing  the  detailed  structure  of  rain,  wind,  ocean  surface  waves,  sea  surface
temperature and currents. These detailed forecast fields can bridge the gap between
the  traditional  forecast  of  track  and  intensity  and  realistic  hurricane  impacts  at
landfall.

Furthermore, the success of forecasting hurricane intensity change will depend on
the  ability  of  assimilating  new  observations  and  ensemble-based  probabilistic  fore-
casts using the high-resolution atmosphere-wave-ocean coupled models. A better un-
derstanding of the predictability of fine scale features in the extreme wind and rain
fields associated with hurricanes is also critical. The NSB report and the H.R. 2407
Section 3 have highlighted these urgent needs as high-priority for the research com-
munity to address.

A  further  issue  in  increasing  the  fidelity  of  hurricane  intensity  and  track  fore-
casts,  especially  for  increasing  the  forecast  horizon  beyond  five  days,  is  improved
global  weather  predication  models  that  provide  the  large-scale  forcing  for  the  high
resolution  storm-scale  forecasts.  The  resolution  and  number  of  ensemble  members
of  the  NOAA  NCEP  Global  Forecasting  System  are  significantly  lower  than  that  of
the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). The higher
resolution  ECMWF  model  is  being  used  as  the  basis  for  extended  range  hurricane
forecasting,  and  the  synergy  of  the  higher  resolution  global  weather  model  having
a large number of ensemble members with the high-resolution coupled atmosphere-
wave-ocean  storm-scale  model  provides  the  foundation  for  a  substantially  improved
hurricane  forecasting  system  with  improved  accuracy,  more  specific  information  re-
garding impacts, and an extended time horizon for the forecasts.

An Integrated Approach for Improving Hurricane Forecast and Emergency

Response

To  improve  preparedness  in  response  to  hurricane  impacts,  a  new  integrated  ap-
proach  in  hurricane  forecasting  and  warning  is  sorely  needed.  This  system  should
be capable of:

• Providing  accurate  forecast  of  high-resolution  wind,  storm  surge,  rain,  and
flood on the short lead time of days to hours, and potential hurricane genesis
and track on extended lead time of weeks;
• Assessing  potential  hurricane  impacts  on  human  lives  (fatalities  and  suf-
fering)  and  broad-range  economy  loss  (property  and  infrastructure  damage,
power  outage,  insured  losses)  based  on  the  forecast  of  wind,  surge,  rain,  and
flood;
• Communicating  with  federal  and  local  government  to  optimize  the  utility  of
• Rapidly transferring research products to NOAA and other operations;
• Training  the  next-generation  scientists  and  forecasters  with  innovative  tools
• Educating  vulnerable  residents  on  the  application  value  of  the  new  informa-
tion  coming  out  of  the  integrated  forecast  system  on  short  and  long  lead
times.

the forecast and assessment products in emergency response;

for hurricane prediction and impact mitigation;

The  ultimate  goal  of  this  integrated  system  is  to  improve  risk  assessment  and
mitigation over the U.S. coastal regions so lives will be saved and economic loss re-
duced.

Conclusion

The  research  required  to  address  these  challenges  requires  an  ambitious,  trans-
formative  and  risky  research  agenda  that  stimulates  new  directions  and  styles  of
inquiry  in  research  including  collaborative,  cross-disciplinary  and  interdisciplinary
approaches.  New  centers  and  partnerships  between  university  researchers,  govern-
ment agencies and the private sector are needed to meet these challenges. The aca-
demic  hurricane  research  community  is  ready  to  lead  an  ambitious  and  trans-
formative  interdisciplinary  research  agenda  required  to  lay  the  foundations  for  de-
velopment  of  an  integrated  hurricane  forecast  and  response  system  that  will  help
mitigate hurricane damage. The envisioned research agenda will advance our ability
to  collect  accurate  observations  from  the  atmosphere,  air-sea  interface,  and  the
ocean and to assimilate such observations for hurricane forecasting, to improve pre-
diction  models,  to  use  forecast  products  for  better  risk  assessment,  and  ultimately
to mitigate hurricane damage. There is critical need for the involvement of the NSF
to  support  the  ambitious  and  risky  interdisciplinary  research  agenda,  in  ways  that
go beyond what is feasible in individual mission oriented government agencies. The
development  and  operation  of  such  an  integrated  hurricane  forecast  and  response
system  requires  collaboration  and  coordination  among  many  research  disciplines
and among the research community and government and impacted sectors. Further,
successful implementation of such a system requires the education of a new genera-
tion of scientists, technicians, forecasters, government managers, and be guaranteed
with a smooth transition from research to NOAA operations.

In  closing,  it  is  of  no  doubt  that  improving  the  hurricane  forecast  and  response
to  save  lives  and  reduce  economic  loss  should  be  a  national  priority.  The  rapid  ad-
vancement  of  science  and  technology  presents  us  with  an  unprecedented  capability
and  opportunity  to  develop  the  integrated  hurricane  forecast  and  response  system
that  will  support  risk  assessments  and  emergency  management  by  reducing  warn-
ing areas and providing forecasts with longer lead time. There is no reason for fur-
ther  delay  of  full-scale  support  for  such  development,  which  is  long  over  due.  We
are confident that with the requested fiscal support the hurricane research commu-
nity  will  meet  the  scientific  and  engineering  challenges  and  in  collaboration  with
the  relevant  government  agencies  will  develop  and  implement  such  an  integrated
hurricane forecast and response system for operations in the coming decade.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Dr. Chen.
Dr. Prevatt, you are recognized for five minutes.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  DAVID  O.  PREVATT,  ASSISTANT  PRO-
FESSOR,  DEPARTMENT  OF  CIVIL  AND  COASTAL  ENGINEER-
ING, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA, GAINESVILLE
Dr.  PREVATT.  Chairman  Baird,  Chairman  Lampson,  and  honor-
able Subcommittee Members, my name is David Prevatt, and I am
a Professional Engineer and Assistant Professor of Civil and Coast-
al  Engineering  at  the  University  of  Florida.  I  appreciate,  really
truly appreciate the opportunity to speak to you on this bill.

Your  own  bipartisan  support  for  this  bill,  the  collective  voice
from  the  State  of  Florida  Representatives,  underscores  the  impor-
tance that hurricane mitigation plays in our lives in that State. In-
creasing  national  support  for  hurricane  research  is  of  critical  im-
portance  if  we  are  to  reduce  the  enormous  economic  losses  from
hurricanes.

Funding  for  research  to  address  damage  to  buildings  and  infra-
structure,  which  by  far  dominates  the  economic  impact  of  hurri-
canes,  is  under-represented  in  the  current  budget,  as  it  has  been
for decades. In my testimony I have suggested several categories in
this bill that probably should be considered for reprioritization.

Preparation for hurricanes. This begins long before landfall, long
before  the  24-hour  window.  It  begins  when  we  first  construct  our
buildings.  It  begins  when  we  first  retrofit  the  existing  infrastruc-
ture  we  have  today.  Nearly  40  years  ago  the  National  Bureau  of
Standards reporting on Hurricane Camille damage noted that most
failures  in  rural  homes  were  to  roofs  and  that  proper  anchorage
was non-existent. That same concern was voiced by me and by oth-
ers after Hurricanes Francis, Charlie, Ivan in 2004, Wilma in 2005,
and Katrina.

Sadly,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  the  situation  is  not  much  different
now  than  it  was  in  1969,  with  regard  to  hurricane  resistance  of
buildings  and  our  infrastructure.  The  fact  is  nearly  90  percent  of
all  homes,  those  built  before  1994  building  code  changes,  have  in-
adequate connections, and they risk significant damage from hurri-
canes.

Therefore,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  harden  those  homes  to  re-
duce  hurricane  losses.  And  currently  we  must  address  how  to  en-
sure  the  adequate  performance  of  future  homes.  These  are  the
issues  which  really  reduce  the  economic  loss  and  the  disruption  to
people.  Consequently,  the  highest  priority,  I  believe,  should  be
placed on reducing the damage and minimizing economic losses.

Some of the issues that should be at the forefront of the research
agenda  to  reduce  wind  damage  to  buildings  and  storm  surge  dam-
age  to  buildings  and  infrastructure.  One,  a  need  to  improve  our
knowledge of the special variability of surface level winds that im-
pact buildings, a need to understand how a hurricane is attenuated
as  it  makes  landfall,  a  better  understanding  of  how  and  at  what
loads  do  our  existing  buildings  fail,  and  how  can  we  really  apply
this knowledge to the new construction coming on-board.

We  need  an  intense  program  to  study  the  ways  of  identifying
weaknesses  in  this  existing  infrastructure  and  ways  to  provide
practical retrofit techniques to ameliorate these problems.

Further,  we  need  to  quantitatively  understand  the  storm  surge
and wave loading on coastal structures, on bridges, and how coast-
al structures also respond to these loads.

And finally, a need for robust support of academic infrastructure
that  generates  basic  science  and  technology  research  and  provides
increased  availability  of  trained  faculty  and  researchers  and
trained engineers to implement these improved practices.

While the loss of life in hurricanes has dropped dramatically over
the  past  decades  due  to  improved  warning  and  forecasting,  the
amount  of  damage,  the  amount  of  economic  loss—it  continues  to
spiral  upward  at  an  exponential  rate.  This  trend  is  projected  to
continue  as  more  properties,  more  wealth  is  concentrated  in  the
vulnerable coastal areas that we have heard about today.

It  is  only  through  mitigation  that  we  have  any  hope  of  reducing
the  increases,  much  less  begin  to  reduce  the  losses  when  major
events occur.

Strong consideration should be given to increasing support for se-
verely  under-funded  areas,  i.e.,  the  performance  of  buildings  and
infrastructure  under  hurricane  loads.  In  this  way  we  will  see  the
most immediate, tangible benefits from our increased research and
infrastructure improvement.

I believe improved forecasting by itself will not have a significant
impact  on  loss  reduction,  however,  we  develop  cost-effective  ways
to  harden  the  80  to  90  percent  of  homes  built  before  recent  code
improvements, our widespread vulnerability will remain.

Investing  in  creation  of  new  knowledge  and  in  more-effective
ways of using the existing knowledge that we have is the only way
to  change  current  trends.  Improving  the  resilience  of  civil  infra-
structure  and  houses  can  significantly  reduce  economic  losses  of
hurricanes. I admit, many unanswered questions remain regarding
the construction of new facilities, and the problems of existing con-
struction  has  hardly  begun  to  be  addressed.  However,  a  sustain-
able,  federally-supported  long-term  research  program  in  this  area
envisioned  by  this  bill  and  others  can,  indeed,  make  a  difference.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID O. PREVATT

1. INTRODUCTION

Chairman Baird and Chairman Lampson and Honorable Subcommittee Members,
my name is David Prevatt, and I am a professional engineer and Assistant Professor
of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida. The faculty of the De-
partment  of  Civil  and  Coastal  Engineering  (CCE)  is  very  active  in  multiple  aspects
of hurricane hazards research and the design of hazard resistant infrastructure. Our
research  focuses  on  understanding  the  hurricane  effects  (wind,  rain,  storm  surge)
on  buildings  and  infrastructure  in  hurricane-prone  coastal  regions  in  order  to  in-
crease their resilience. Our combined expertise includes:

fits

• Building and infrastructure design against surge and wind hazards
• In-field measurement and characterization of hurricane winds and wind loads
• Evaluation of structural capacity to resist wind loads and the efficacy of retro-
• Prediction and modeling of storm surge, wave, and coastal flooding
• Remote  sensing  of  high  resolution  ground  elevation  and  bathymetry  (ocean
• Lifeline protection and restoration
• Transportation issues for emergency evacuation
• High performance computing and data warehousing/mining.

It  is  clear  that  there  are  several  common  areas  of  interest  for  H.R.  2407  and  the
wind  and  civil  engineering  research  community.  I  applaud  this  increased  emphasis
on understanding and predicting the nature and impact of hurricanes. However, the
proposed  research  efforts,  while  they  address  important  goals,  do  not  do  much  to
reduce the damage or economic losses from hurricanes. Funding for research to ad-
dress damage to buildings and civil infrastructure, which by far dominates the eco-
nomic impact of hurricanes, is under-represented in the current budget. We believe
emphasis of several categories in this bill and the National Science Board (NSB) re-
port of 2007 should be re-prioritized.

1.1 Background

Nearly  40  years  ago,  the  National  Bureau  of  Standards  reporting  on  Hurricane
Camille damage noted that the most common failure in homes was to roofs and that
proper  anchorage  was  non-existent.  These  same  concerns  have  repeatedly  been
voiced  by  researchers  over  the  ensuing  years  (Table  1),  who  also  noted  recurring
widespread  structural  damage  due  to  loss  of  roof  sheathing,  failure  of  load  transfer
at  joints  and  connections.  Sadly,  the  situation  today  is  not  much  different,  wherein
roof failures and improper anchorage still account for the majority of building dam-
age from hurricanes.

It is estimated that 50 percent of the U.S. population now lives in hurricane prone
coastal  areas  (Alvarez  2000).  Hundreds  of  miles  of  once  empty  coastlines  are  now
major population centers with trillions of dollars of buildings and infrastructure ex-
posed  to  the  risk  of  hurricane  damage.  The  vast  majority  of  residential  structures
(over  80  percent)  in  these  areas  were  constructed  before  recent  improvements  to
building  codes  that  occurred  after  Hurricane  Andrew.  Therefore  there  is  an  urgent
need  to  harden  those  homes  to  reduce  annual  hurricane  losses.  It  must  be  recog-
nized  that  hurricanes  are  just  one  of  the  several  sources  of  damage  and  loss  due
to extreme winds and that tornadoes, down-bursts and frontal winds also contribute
to large annual losses that could be reduced through better connections and develop-
ment of continuous load paths.

Civil engineers and particularly wind engineers are critically aware of factors con-
tributing to high failure rates of buildings and infrastructure and we have been inti-
mately involved in the effort to improve the knowledge base to reduce hurricane im-
pacts. Indeed many of us have previously testified before Congressional Subcommit-
tees  (Bienkiewicz  2004;  Levitan  2005;  Prevatt  2005;  Reinhold  2005)  and  our  mem-
bers  have  supported  related  legislation  H.R.  3940,  the  National  Windstorm  Impact
Reduction Act of 2004.

Hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, and associated phenomena cause an exces-
sive level of property losses and human suffering in the United States. With the ex-
ception  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  loss  of  life  has  been  significantly  reduced  through
warnings about hurricanes and the loss of life in tornadoes and other extreme wind
events typically average less than 100 per year. Consequently, the highest national

55

priority  should  be  placed  on  reducing  the  damage  and  minimizing  economic  loss.
With the exception of strengthening building codes in some hurricane prone regions,
our  success  in  reducing  losses  has  been  poor  over  the  past  40  years.  This  is  due  in
large  part  to  the  limited  research  and  technology  transfer  support  that  is  focused
on strengthening the existing built infrastructure and in the development of cost ef-
fective retrofit and mitigation measures.

1.2 Effects of Recent Hurricanes on Buildings and Infrastructure

The  2004  and  2005  hurricane  seasons  were  a  real-time  laboratory  for  evaluating
the  performance  of  our  buildings.  Several  of  our  faculty  were  deployed  during  the
storms  and  collected  perishable  damage  data  immediately  after  the  events.  There
were several areas of concern regarding performance of buildings and infrastructure:
• Small  breaches  in  the  building  envelope,  especially  in  the  roofing  systems,
can  provide  paths  for  water  leakage  that  result  in  extensive  water  damage
to the interior walls, ceilings, and to building contents. Minor roofing failures
(loss  of  asphalt  shingle  and  underlayment)  to  one  Pensacola  house  resulted
in water damage to about 80 percent of all interior finishes on the ceiling and
walls. The cost of drying out water-soaked buildings and removal of mold has
been  a  growth  industry  since  these  hurricanes.  Less  durable  materials,  insu-
lation,  gypsum  sheathing  and  acoustic  ceiling  tiles  cannot  be  dried  out  and
must be removed and replaced. The gutting of houses and businesses contrib-
utes tons of debris and toxic substances to our landfills.

• Numerous  engineered  buildings  suffered  little  damage,  and  retrofitted  non-
engineered  houses  also  performed  satisfactorily.  In  Charley,  a  major  success
story  was  the  good  to  excellent  performance  of  newer  manufactured  homes
that  were  built  in  accordance  with  1994  HUD  guidelines.  Most  of  these  sur-
vived  with  minimal  damage,  while  adjacent  older  manufactured  homes  that
did not have wind-resistant construction were destroyed.

• Failure of building envelope systems caused significant disruption to hospitals
and critical facilities during these storms. From Mobile, AL to Ft. Myers, FL,
more than a dozen hospitals were damaged or were evacuated due to the 2004
hurricanes. Charlotte Regional Hospital in Port Charlotte and the Navy Hos-
pital  in  Pensacola  both  sustained  damage  to  their  roofing  systems,  and  win-
dows.  One  hospital  damaged  in  Hurricane  Frances  in  2004,  suffered  further
damage as Hurricane Jeanne passed through the area just three weeks later.
• Several fire stations and hurricane evacuation shelters were not able to main-
tain  function  throughout  or  after  the  storms.  The  Turner-Arcadia  Civic  Cen-
ter  in  Central  Florida  suffered  a  masonry  wall  and  roof  collapse  while  shel-
tering 1,200 persons from Hurricane Charley.

These  poor  and  variable  performances  are  examples  of  a  larger  problem  related

to buildings and infrastructure.

1.3 Research Priorities to Improve the Resilience of Structures

Specifically some of the factors that are important to reducing loss and wind dam-

age to buildings and infrastructure are:

• A need to improve our knowledge of surface level winds and their spatial var-

iability during extreme wind events.

• A  need  to  better  understand  the  potential  loadings  on  structures  through  a
comprehensive program of boundary layer wind tunnel testing and validation
using field observations.

• A  better  understanding  of  how  and  at  what  level  of  loading  existing  struc-

tures fail and the application of this knowledge to new construction.

• An intense program to study various ways of identifying weaknesses in exist-
ing  infrastructure  and  practical  retrofit  techniques  to  ameliorate  these  prob-
lems.

• Comprehensive  testing  of  full  scale  structures  to  learn  how  to  economically
improve  wind  and  hazard  resistant  construction  and  associated  water  pene-
tration and damage.

• A need to improve the techniques to assess the economic impacts of different

design decisions for both new and retrofit applications.

• A  need  to  quantitatively  understand  the  surge  and  wave  loading  on  coastal

structures and how the coastal structures respond to loading.

• A need for a new robustness in the supporting academic infrastructure to gen-
erate improved basic supporting science and technology, to improve the avail-
ability of trained new university faculty/researchers, and trained engineers to
implement improved practices and planning.

In this era of limited funds, it is necessary to set realistic expectations and to give
priority  to  initiatives  that  have  the  greatest  chance  of  reducing  the  hurricane  im-
pact. Consideration should also be given to increasing support for the most severely
under-funded areas, that of civil infrastructure. In their comment on the draft NSB
report,  the  Weather  Coalition  stated  that  ‘‘Hurricanes  are  complex  and  violent  sys-
tems. Even the best research initiative will only improve forecasts, not perfect them.’’
However,  the  focus  should  be  to  improve  performance  of  buildings  and  infrastruc-
ture,  and  we  will  see  the  most  immediate  and  tangible  benefits  from  increased  re-
search  on  infrastructure  improvement.  Improved  forecasts  will  not  have  a  signifi-
cant impact on loss reduction.

2. COMMENTS ON NATIONAL SCIENCE BOARD 2007 REPORT

The University of Florida faculty experts in hurricane winds and storm surge rec-
ommend changes to the proposed budget distribution, as well as a re-prioritizing of
subjects within the three investment categories. Comments and suggestions are de-
lineated  below  by  the  following  subsections  of  the  NSB  document:  investment  cat-
egory, recommendations, and appendix.

The  purposes  of  the  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative  shall  be  to  set  re-
search objectives based upon the findings of the January 12, 2007, National Science
Board report entitled Hurricane Warning: The Critical Need for the National Hurri-
cane  Research  Initiative,  to  make  recommendations  to  the  NSB  and  NOAA  science
Advisory Board and to assemble expertise and pursue multi-entity research in three
areas:

1. improving hurricane and other severe tropical storm forecasting capabilities,

including formation, track, and intensity change

2. durable and resilient infrastructure; and
3. mitigating impacts on coastal populations, the coastal built environment, and
the  natural  coastal  environment,  including  but  not  limited  to,  coral  reefs,
wetlands, and other natural systems that mitigate hurricane wind and storm
surge impacts.

For  the  sake  of  clarity,  the  comments  below  follow  the  structure  of  the  NSB  re-
port.  General  comments  are  provided  on  the  overall  document,  followed  by  com-
ments on specific sections in the report and delineated herein.

2.1 General Comments on the NSB Report

The NSB Report identifies for Investment categories (#1, Understanding and Pre-
diction, #2, Impacts, #3 Preparedness and Response Measures, and #4 Cross-cutting
Activities), and it provides recommendations for action and budget of approximately
$300  million.  H.R.  2407  proposes  that  $285  million  be  authorized  for  this  effort  for
each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2018.

We recommend that a working group be assigned with direct links among the
four  investment  categories,  so  that  R&D  will  not  be  performed  independently,
but  that  resources  be  assigned  to  address  those  issues  that  can  be  shown  to
have the most significant impact.
We  recommend  that  the  initiative  be  developed  within  a  defined  interagency
group, comprising of NSF, NOAA, FEMA and NIST.

Appendix  C:  Proposed  Strategic  Investment  in  the  National  Hurricane  Re-
search Initiative—pg. 29
Problem:  Funding  to  address  damage  to  civil  infrastructure,  which  by  far  domi-
nates  the  economic  impact  of  hurricanes,  is  under-represented  in  the  current  budg-
et.  Given  the  weighting  of  expertise  represented  on  the  NSB  panel  (only  10  out  55
panel members were civil engineers), this priority received less attention than war-
ranted.  Consequently,  the  proposed  NHRI  budget  is  directed  to  already  heavily
funded  NSF  programs,  while  research  areas  that  represent  the  highest  potential
gains in risk reduction are not well funded.

We  recommend  that  funding  support  the  core  high-priority  research  areas
that are currently most severely under-funded.

We recommend against redistributing NHRI funding to already heavily fund-
ed NSF programs, such as cyberinfrastructure ($492M in FY 2005), networking
and  information  technology  R&D  ($811M  in  FY  2005)  and  climate  change
($197M  in  FY  2005).  Rather,  an  increase  in  the  current  (and  very  modest)  an-
nual  expenditures  on  engineering  and  the  built  environment  would  provide  far
greater  immediate  benefit,  given  the  dominance  of  infrastructure  damage  on
economic  loss.  The  table  below  reflects  our  suggested  reprioritizing  of  strategic
investments.

Investment Category #1: Understanding and Prediction, pages 13–15
HIGH  PRIORITY:  Predicting  hurricane  intensification  and  size,  and  reducing  the
uncertainty  associated  with  where  and  when  hurricanes  will  make  landfall—pg.  13
Problem: Existing hurricane models do not have adequate parameterization to rep-
resent the dissipation effects of land on hurricanes.

We  recommend  that  an  additional  HIGH  PRIORITY  item  be  established  to
focus research to understand the effect of land roughness on hurricane intensity
decay.

HIGH  PRIORITY:  predicting  storm  surge,  rainfall  and  inland  flooding  from  hurri-
canes and tropical storms—pg. 13
Problem:  One  key  to  limiting  the  loss  of  life  in  both  coastal  and  inland  flooding
is having high resolution topographic maps with sufficient spatial resolution to iden-
tify  where  constricted  flow  is  likely  to  cause  flash  flooding.  The  U.S.  is  well  behind
when it comes to producing high quality, one foot contour topographic maps. During
the  past  decade  many  European  nations  have  used  airborne  laser  swath  mapping
(ALSM, also known as LiDAR) and ground based laser scanning to map their entire
nations. In the U.S. only a few states have launched programs to obtain high resolu-
tion  digital  terrain  maps  and  contour  maps  suitable  for  comprehensive  flood  plan-
ning, using airborne and ground based laser scanning. The U.S. should have digital
elevation models adequate to support one foot contour maps across the Nation. The
highest  priority  should  be  given  to  areas  at  risk  for  flash  floods.  The  combination
of  airborne  and  ground  based  laser  scanning  is  the  method  of  choice  for  collecting
the necessary observations.

Suggestion #1: Emphasize the importance of high resolution topographic maps
to  predict  both  coastal  and  inland  flooding  and  limit  loss  of  life  and  economic
loss.
Suggestion  #2:  Research  is  needed  to  fully  understand  and  predict  the  effect
of  waves  on  storm  surge,  coastal  inundation,  and  loading  on  coastal  infrastruc-
tures,  including  houses,  bridges,  levees,  and  power  plants.  Wave  loading  is
much more destructive for coastal infrastructures than storm surge alone.
Suggestion #3: For more accurate and cost effective mitigation and evacuation
planning,  high  resolution  street-level  forecasts  are  needed.  Current  hurricane
and storm surge forecasts by the U.S. Government have much lower spatial res-
olution  (hundreds  of  meters)  than  the  LiDAR  data.  Street-level  forecasts  are
needed  to  enable  more  accurate  and  cost-effective  mitigation  and  evacuation
planning. To enable street-level forecasts, it is more prudent to adopt more effi-
cient forecast models than to increase computational capability.
Suggestion #4: Research is needed to fully understand the flow-structure inter-
action  during  hurricanes.  Storm  surge  and  coastal  flooding  is  strongly  affected
by  such  manmade  or  natural  structures  as  levees,  wetlands,  marshes,  coral
reefs, and beach dunes.

HIGH PRIORITY: Improved in situ observations—pg. 13

Problem: Direct measurement of the hurricane is a necessary underpinning of vir-
tually every other investment category enumerated in this document. Prevention of
infrastructure damage to winds must be based upon detailed knowledge of dynamic
wind loads, which can only be gathered via direct measurement. A historical dearth
of  direct  observation  of  ground  level  wind  speeds  during  landfalling  hurricanes  is
among the biggest obstacles in the design against extreme wind loads. Additionally,
all remote sensing is ultimately dependent upon direct measurement for refinement,
validation and calibration.

Suggestion: Emphasize the importance of observations of data at surface level
winds and its interactions (pressure generation) on structures.

Investment Category #2: Impacts and Interactions, pages 15–16
HIGH PRIORITY: Interaction of hurricanes with engineered structures—pg. 15
Problem:  Current  codes  (except  for  perhaps  earthquake  effects)  do  not  adequately
incorporate dynamic loading (e.g., wind, vessel impact, surge, waves) for foundation/
soil  interaction  or  foundation/water  interaction  for  cyclic  or  surge  loading.  We  have
the  system  characterization  capabilities,  and  the  mechanics/computational  abilities
to  account  for  dynamics,  but  we  sorely  lack  experimental  research  to  calibrate  and
validate our analysis systems, particularly at full-scale. With the advent of Network
for  Earthquake  Engineering  Simulation  (NEES)  at  NSF,  we  now  have  the  experi-
mental  equipment  capable  of  full-scale  experiments.  We  now  need  the  funding  to
pursue this research.

Suggestion  #1:  Add  an  additional  HIGH  PRIORITY  item  that  addresses  the
need  for  full-scale  experimentation  to  capture  the  effects  of  dynamic  wind/rain/
surge  loads  on  the  infrastructure,  which  as  of  today  is  poorly  incorporated  in
building  codes.  Current  practice  focuses  on  the  performance  of  individual  com-
ponents  in  isolation,  but  the  most  often  observed  failures  are  a  result  of  inter-
action  among  multiple  components  (system  response).  We  sorely  lack  research
to evaluate system performance issues via full-scale experiment.
Suggestion #2: Add an additional HIGH PRIORITY item that addresses retro-
fitting  of  existing  structures.  Retrofitting  of  critical  infrastructure  in  hurricane
prone  regions  is  urgently  needed  to  protect  the  public  and  life-line  services.
Ninety percent of existing residential homes were built before building code im-
provement  modifications  that  occurred  after  Hurricane  Andrew.  As  with  earth-
quake prone regions, retrofitting of existing structures will result in lower dam-
age and fewer lives lost. This, combined with a tightening of the existing build-
ing codes, should be a substantial emphasis.

Problem:  Recent  hurricane  seasons  have  clearly  demonstrated  that  highway
bridges  which  are  key  components  of  infrastructure  lifelines,  at  risk  of  failure  due
to  the  combined  effects  of  wind,  storm  surge,  and  vessel  impact  loading.  During
Hurricanes  Ivan  (2004)  and  Katrina  (2005),  major  interstate  bridges  along  critical
lifelines  were  destroyed  by  storm  surge  loading.  Additionally,  Hurricane  Katrina
demonstrated  that  barges,  ships,  and  floating  structures  such  as  drill  rigs,  can
break  loose  during  storms  and  collide  with  bridge  structures  and  levee  walls,  thus
generating significant impact loads and damage.

Suggestion #3: As with earthquake prone regions, retrofitting of critical infra-
structure  in  hurricane  prone  regions  is  urgently  needed  to  protect  the  public
and lifeline services. This should be addressed in the draft.
Suggestion  #4:  Development  of  procedures  for  evaluating  (both  pre-  and  post-
event),  and  improving,  the  resistance  of  infrastructure  components  under  the
combined effects of wind, storm surge, and vessel impact needs to be a high pri-
ority  item.  The  approach  taken  must  account  not  only  for  structural  aspects  of
bridge performance under these conditions, but also the statistical probabilities
that such combined multi-hazard loading conditions occur simultaneously.

Investment  Category  #3:  Preparedness  and  Response  Measures,  pages  16–
18
HIGH PRIORITY: assessing and improving the resilience of the built environment—
pg. 16
Problem: The  massive  economic  impact  of  hurricanes  is  in  many  ways  a  direct  re-
sult of engineering designs mandated by building codes. For a large majority of the
existing  infrastructure,  extreme  events  associated  with  hurricanes  (e.g.,  wind  &
wave loading, tidal surges, bridge scour, etc.) are simply a secondary consideration.
For  example,  current  bridge  design  specifications  only  address  wind  induced  forces,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:23 Dec 13, 2008 Jkt 042964 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE08\062608\42964 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

59

with no recognition of wave loading, even when more than 15 bridges were lost from
waves/surge during Katrina. In addition, much of the existing infrastructure involv-
ing geotechnical related issues (i.e., levees, dams, bridge foundations, etc.), were de-
signed  using  the  ‘‘allowable  stress’’  procedure  that  incorporates  a  global  factor  of
safety.  However,  no  consideration  for  the  degree  of  risk  or  probability  of  failure  of
said  systems  has  ever  been  undertaken.  Moreover,  even  though  some  of  the  newer
codes  are  moving  towards  incorporating  risk  assessment,  i.e.,  (Load  and  Resistance
Factor  Design  (LRFD),  with  associated  load  and  resistance  factors  developed
through research, the majority of geotechnical infrastructure (dams, levees, building
foundations, etc.) load and resistance factors have never been established.

Suggestion: Emphasis needs to be placed on research toward the efficacy of the
current design practice in light of recent infrastructure failures. The NSB report
calls for the investigation of damage due to non-compliance, but the majority of
damage is clearly the result of adequate compliance with inadequate codes.

HIGH PRIORITY: Disaster response and recovery—pg. 17
Problem: Getting victims out of and relief services into an affected area is critically
dependent  on  the  condition  of  the  roadway  network  in  the  area.  Aerial  based  tech-
nologies  need  to  be  developed  and/or  evaluated  for  their  ability  to  provide  a  survey
of  critical  roadway  infrastructure  items  (e.g.,  passable  roads,  navigational  signage
condition,  and  status  of  traffic  control  devices).  This  information  can  be  used  with
Geographic  Information  Systems  to  develop  usable  transportation  routes  into  and
out of the area.

Suggestion:  A  prioritization  of  critical  links  in  the  highway  system  should  be
developed,  based  on  anticipated  origin-destinations  in  disaster  response  condi-
tions (for example, to and from shelters, hospitals, etc.)

Investment Category #4: Cross-Cutting Activities
MEDIUM PRIORITY: Computational Capability—pg. 18
Problem:  With  the  well-recognized  scarcity  of  funding,  it  is  not  prudent  to  divert
funds to well-funded and generic research that will advance full-force with no fund-
ing from a hurricane mitigation-specific program. This is an important but not well-
funded item.

We  recommend  removal  of  this  priority  item:  Computational  capability  is
an important, but is already well-funded through existing programs.

MEDIUM  PRIORITY:  Training  and  education  programs  related  to  hurricane  im-
pacts—pg. 18
Problem: Education and training already receives $844M annually from NSF. This
falls under the category of ‘‘important but heavily funded elsewhere.

Suggestion: Remove or de-emphasize the funding for this priority.

General Implementing Recommendations, pages 19–21
Leadership—pg. 20
Problem:  Although  considerable  progress  has  been  made  on  arriving  at  improved
loading standards and on some methods of improving constructed facilities many of
these improvements are based on an existing information base that is over 30 years
old. Unfortunately support for these efforts has not continued at a level that encour-
ages basic research. What is needed now is new research capabilities to supplement
current  efforts  and  generate  fundamental  knowledge  from  which  next  generation
buildings  and  retrofit  techniques  can  emerge.  The  emphasis  of  these  activities  re-
sides in understanding buildings and infrastructure.

Suggestion: Designate the National Science Foundation as the custodian for all
funding.  This  research  belongs  in  the  hands  of  the  federal  agency  primarily
tasked  to  supported  basic  research  conducted  by  our  colleges  and  universities.
Operational  agencies  (meaning  those  organizations  responsible  for  exploration,
prediction,  monitoring,  response,  and  recovery)  should  carry  a  supporting  role,
but not share parallel responsibilities.

Maintaining dialogue with the broad community—pg. 20
Problem:  Progress  will  be  made  by  engaging  all  stakeholders  responsible  for  con-
struction  and  retrofit  of  buildings  and  infrastructure,  including  legislative  bodies,
academic researchers, and building professionals.

60

Suggestion:  Use  conferences  already  in  existence.  Stage  the  meetings/presen-
tations  from  the  annual  Interdepartmental  Hurricane  Conference  held  by  the
Office  of  the  Federal  Coordinator  of  Meteorology.  It  is  the  most  reputable  and
well-attended by government stakeholders.
Suggestion:  The  panel  is  recommended  to  seek  input  from  civil  engineers
through  the  existing  associations  who  work  to  protect  buildings  and  infrastruc-
ture  from  hurricanes.  We  recommend  that  the  American  Association  for  Wind
Engineering  and  the  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers  be  consulted  within
the  process,  since  those  organizations  combined  nearly  a  decade  ago  to  initiate
the initial legislation that will expire in November 2008.

3. SUMMARY

The cost of hurricanes is something that we bear as a society. The losses and dis-
ruptions  have  profound  and  widespread  impacts  to  the  social  structure  of  commu-
nities  and  to  the  ecological  systems  upon  which  we  depend.  While  the  loss  of  life
in hurricanes has dropped over the past decades due to improved warning and fore-
casting,  the  amount  of  damage  and  economic  loss  continues  to  spiral  upward  at  an
exponential rate. This trend is projected to continue upward as more properties and
wealth  are  concentrated  in  vulnerable  coastal  areas.  It  is  only  through  mitigation
that  we  have  any  hope  of  reducing  the  increases  much  less  begin  to  reduce  losses
when major events occur.

Investing  in  the  creation  of  new  knowledge  and  in  more  effective  ways  of  using
existing  knowledge  is  the  only  way  to  change  the  current  trends.  The  research  to
improve the resilience of civil infrastructure and houses can significantly reduce the
enormous  economic  costs  of  hurricanes.  Many  unanswered  questions  regarding  the
design  and  construction  of  new  facilities  remain,  and  the  problems  of  existing  con-
struction  have  hardly  been  addressed.  However,  a  sustainable,  federally-supported,
long-term research program can indeed make the difference.

BIOGRAPHY FOR DAVID O. PREVATT

Born in Nassau, Bahamas and growing up in Trinidad and Tobago, Dr. David O.
Prevatt  has  lived  in  hurricane-prone  regions  for  most  of  his  life.  In  1985,  Prevatt
graduated  from  the  University  of  the  West  Indies  (UWI),  Trinidad  with  a  BSc
(Honours) degree in Civil Engineering. He worked as a structural engineer in Trini-
dad  until  1990  when  he  joined  an  IDRC-funded  research  project  on  Caribbean  Cy-
clone-Resistant  Housing  at  UWI’s  Civil  Engineering  Department.  Prevatt  came  to
the  United  States  in  1993  to  pursue  his  Ph.D.  at  Clemson  University,  working  at
the  Wind  Load  Test  Facility.  His  research  on  evaluating  the  wind  uplift  capacity
of  various  mechanically  attached  commercial  roofing  systems  sought  to  assess  the
validity  of  industry-standard  test  methods  and  compare  these  with  roof  behavior
subject  to  true  spatial  and  temporally  varying  wind  loads.  After  earning  his  Ph.D.
in  1998,  Dr.  Prevatt  worked  as  structural  engineer  with  the  Boston-based  ENR500
consulting  engineering  firm,  Simpson  Gumpertz  &  Heger  Inc.,  from  1998  through
2004,  concentrating  in  the  design,  performance  and  investigation  of  building  enclo-
sure  systems.  His  expertise  is  in  structural  engineering,  wind  engineering  and  the
performance  of  building  envelope  systems,  and  forensic  engineering.  Dr.  Prevatt  is
a  professional  engineer  registered  in  the  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  and  in
Trinidad  and  Tobago  with  over  15  years  consulting  experience  in  structural  engi-
neering and building investigations.

In May 2007, Dr. Prevatt joined the faculty at the University of Florida as an As-
sistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering. Dr. Prevatt’s
research  continues  to  focus  on  the  mitigation  of  hurricane  damage,  particularly  to
low-rise  construction.  His  current  research  involves  experimental  investigation  and
analytical modeling of the structural load paths in wood-framed structures, and the
wind  uplift  testing  of  building  cladding  components.  Prior  to  this  appointment,  Dr.
Prevatt  was  on  the  faculty  of  Clemson  University  where  he  was  an  Assistant  Pro-
fessor and served as Director of the Wind Load Test Facility, conducting wind engi-
neering  research  using  a  boundary  layer  wind  tunnel  to  quantify  wind  loading  on
residential structures, to compare and validate field wind pressures collected during
the 2004/2005 hurricanes. Dr. Prevatt is a member of the American Society of Civil
Engineers, the American Association for Wind Engineering, and the UK Wind Engi-
neering Society.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Dr. Prevatt.
Dr. Leatherman, you are recognized for five minutes.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  STEPHEN  P.  LEATHERMAN,  CHAIR  PRO-
FESSOR  AND  DIRECTOR,  INTERNATIONAL  HURRICANE  RE-
SEARCH CENTER & LABORATORY FOR COASTAL RESEARCH,
FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY
Dr.  LEATHERMAN.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  all
the  other  distinguished  Members  of  Congress  and  especially  to
Congressman Diaz-Balart, who I had the pleasure of working with
over the years.

Today  I  would  like  to  show  you  a  few  slides.  We  are  very  happy
to the have the National Hurricane Center located on the FIU cam-
pus, and we are pleased to have built a strong working relationship
with them over time to support our hurricane agenda. We are pres-
ently  building  a  $15  million  building,  supported  by  the  State  of
Florida,  that  will  be  next  to  the  National  Hurricane  Center.  That
is under construction shortly.

In  terms  of  H.R.  2407,  the  key  elements  in  general  terms  that
need  increased  funding  to  make  a  real  difference  in  saving  lives
and  property,  and  lowering  property  damage  actually  has  been
stated  before,  very  few  people  are  actually  killed  directly  by  hurri-
canes. The big problem really is the incredible losses which are not
sustainable.  If  we  get  another  Andrew-type  hurricane  that  hits
Miami or the Tampa area, it would be between $100 and $150 bil-
lion  in  losses.  This  will  really  cause  an  insurance  meltdown  none
of us even want to think about. So that is one of the big things we
need to work on right now is lowering damage.

There  are  actually  four  different  types  of  hazards  from  hurri-
canes. The International Hurricane Research Center is a multi-dis-
ciplinary center that addresses these different hazards. We have al-
ready heard earlier about social science research. Indeed, it is very
key.  We  looked  at  the  evacuation  problem.  Hurricane  Floyd  in
1999,  in  North  Carolina,  the  problems  there,  also  South  Carolina.
More  recently  Hurricane  Rita  in  2005,  in  Texas,  the  evacuation
was  the  disaster  in  this  case.  I  am  pleased  to  report  that  we  are
now  developing  the  first  quantitative  model,  it  is  under  develop-
ment,  that  will  help  us,  a  quantitative  evacuation  model.  And  so
we  haven’t  seen  this  before,  and  we  have  been  having  it  vetted  by
the  National  Hurricane  Center,  and  with  more  funding  I  think  we
can  bring  this  to  help  us  solve  this  problem  and  better  evacuate
our communities and districts.

We are also working on the insurance industry itself. In fact, we
developed the first public catastrophe model. You have heard about
these  CAT  models  that  are  used  to  set  insurance  rates.  Presently
there are five black box models. We developed an open model. That
means  you  can  see  our  assumptions,  our  code,  and  it  has  been
adopted by the State of Florida and certified.

Now  we  would  like  to  exercise  this  model  to  really  show  us  how
to  do  mitigation  right.  What  are  the  economic  advantages  of  var-
ious  things  you  do  rather  than  just  try  to  do  something.  We  need
to  know  what  to  do  to  lower  the  damage.  In  fact,  this  model  says
that  we  can  expect  to  reduce  our  damages  by  as  much  as  50  per-
cent.  That  is  huge  if  you  think  about  the  damages  we  have  had.
Our  coastal  laboratory,  which  I  brought  down  from  the  Univer-
sity  of  Maryland,  College  Park,  when  I  was  there  years  ago,  has
been  working  very  much  on  storm-surge  modeling.  We  have  been

63

well  served  by  NOAA’s  storm-surge  model  for  decades,  however,
now  new  models  are  being  developed.  We  developed  a  new  model
at  FIU  which  correctly  predicted  the  30-foot  storm  surge  that
Katrina hoisted upon coastal Mississippi. A lot of the other models
came  in  only  at  15  to  20  feet,  and  so  we  know  we  need  to  go  to
these  more  high-resolution  models,  which  have  no  algorithms  and
new technologies to make them much more accurate.

Another  area,  wind-engineering  research.  Huge  opportunities
here.  For  the  first  time  ever  we  are  doing  full-scale  testing.  Keep
in mind in the past we have just been working with wind tunnels.
When houses are reduced down to the size of a bird house, you can
learn  a  lot,  but  you  cannot  really  understand  how  things  fail.  We
are  now  doing  that.  Those  are  shingles.  Actually,  those  are  clay
tiles  flying  off  a  house  under  category  three  winds.  I  hate  to  see
this  photograph  myself,  because  I  have  this  kind  of  house  here  in
Miami, so this hurts me dearly.

We really feel that with this kind of work we can; really, our goal
at the International Hurricane Research Center is to make it so we
can  survive  a  category  three  hurricane  with  little  to  no  damage.
Now,  that  would  solve  about  85  percent  of  the  hurricane  damage
problem  if  you  can  get  through  a  category  three  hurricane.  Keep
in mind, Hurricane Wilma in 2005, was barely a category two, and
produced $16 billion in damage, much of it roof damage. We’ve got
to  do  better,  and  we  can  do  better,  and  in  fact,  we  at  FIU,  we  de-
veloped  the  first  hurricane  simulator.  We  call  it  the  Wall  of  Wind.
It  was  actually  a  two-fan  model.  We  now  have  this  six-fan  model.
It is sponsored and built by Renaissance Reinsurance Company for
us  on  the  campus.  You  can  see  we  are  getting  up  to  135  mile  an
hour.  That  is  a  category  three.  Actually,  it  is  category  four  winds.
There is water and debris injection, as well as the wind field itself.
Recently, this is the first of its kind in the world, and now the Uni-
versity of Florida also, of course, has a hurricane simulator as well,
and we are working with them.

We just won a $10 million Florida Center of Excellence Competi-
tion  to  really  push  this  technology.  We  have  70  industry  partners,
including 3M and DuPont. The DuPont people were just down from
Wilmington,  Delaware,  so  things  are  happening,  testing  is  under
way.

We  are  now  building  the  ultimate  hurricane  simulator.  We  just
recently  ordered  12,  500-horsepower  electric  fans.  We  are  working
with  Florida  Power  and  Light,  because  if  we  turn  it  on,  the  lights
would  dim  in  Miami  if  we  turned  this  thing  on.  So  FP&L  has  as-
sured  us  that  fortunately  there  is  enough  power  coming  out  from
the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant and an open slot, so we can
work  this  simulator.  This  huge  array  of  fans  will  allow  us  to  gen-
erate  category  five  wind,  rain,  and  debris,  and  assault  a  full-size
house  in  this  aircraft  hangar  building,  which  is  now  being  com-
pleted, under controlled and repeatable testing conditions. The first
time  ever  we  have  been  able  to  do  that.  We  are  literally  bringing
the hurricane into the laboratory.

These  are  exciting  times  in  hurricane  research.  We  have  great
capabilities now to make a difference. Real progress is being made
that  has  real  world  applications  with  practical  applications  that
will significantly reduce the damage in the near future.

Finally, I would like to say that FIU is very proud to be the lead-
er of the Florida Hurricane Alliance, of the nine public universities
in  the  State  of  Florida,  including  UF,  Florida  State,  USF,  FAMU,
and  others.  This  is  funded  by  NOAA,  and  we  are  the  lead  institu-
tion on that.

Again, I thank you very much for your time and attention.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Leatherman follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF STEPHEN P. LEATHERMAN

Florida International University (FIU) in Miami, Florida supports H.R. 2407, the
National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative  Act,  introduced  by  Rep.  Alcee  L.  Hastings
and co-sponsored by 18 other members of the Florida Delegation. Similar legislation,
S. 931, introduced by Florida Senators Mel Martinez and Bill Nelson, is pending be-
fore the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.

FIU appreciates the recognition by our Florida leaders for the need for additional
hurricane  mitigation  research  and  commends  the  Committee  for  holding  this  hear-
ing.  We  strongly  concur  with  the  findings  of  the  September  29,  2006,  National
Science Board Report (NSB) entitled ‘‘Hurricane Warning: The Critical Need for Na-
tional Hurricane Initiative,’’ which outlines the urgent national need for strategic ac-
tion  with  respect  to  hurricanes.  FIU  applauds  our  Florida  leaders  for  taking  the
lead  on  this  national  imperative  and  for  introducing  legislation  which  implements
the  recommendations  of  the  National  Science  Board.  We  are  pleased  that  40  Mem-
bers  of  the  House  have  co-sponsored  H.R.  2407  and  hope  that  FIU’s  statement  will
help  convince  the  Committee  and  remaining  Members  of  Congress  of  the  need  to
make passage of this legislation one of the Chamber’s highest priorities.

Florida International University—Miami’s public research university—established
in  1972,  has  more  than  38,000  students,  almost  1,100  full-time  faculty  and  more
than 124,000 graduates, making it the largest university in South Florida and plac-
ing it among the Nation’s 25 largest colleges and Universities. FIU offers more than
200  baccalaureate,  Master’s  and  doctoral  degree  programs  in  21  colleges  and
schools.  Research  is  emphasized  as  a  major  component  of  its  mission.  The  Univer-
sity  is  ranked  as  a  Research  University  in  the  High  Research  Activity  category  of
the Carnegie Foundation’s prestigious classification system. FIU’s College of Law re-
ceived  full  accreditation  in  2006,  and  it  led  all  universities  in  the  State  with  the
highest  pass  rate  of  94.4  percent  on  the  2007  stateside  Florida  Bar  Examination.
In the Fall of 2009 we will be welcoming our first medical school class.

FIU’s  International  Hurricane  Research  Center  is  the  statewide  center  for  hurri-
cane  mitigation  research  in  Florida.  We  also  lead  the  Florida  System-wide  Hurri-
cane Mitigation Alliance, comprised of nine of the eleven Florida public universities.
Before  commenting  on  the  NSB  report  and  H.R.  2407,  I  will  briefly  acquaint  you
with  the  work  that  we  do  at  the  International  Hurricane  Research  Center  and  ex-
plain  why  we  believe  it  is  in  the  national  interest,  and  the  interest  of  the  Federal
Government, to support the development and implementation of a rational research
strategy focusing on the reduction of potential hurricane damage. I will conclude by
providing  FIU’s  thoughts  as  they  pertain  to  the  NSB  report  and  then  comment  on
the provisions of H.R. 2407.

International Hurricane Research Center

The  International  Hurricane  Research  Center  (IHRC)  at  Florida  International
University (FIU) conducts basic and applied multi-disciplinary scientific research to
reduce the potential for damage from hurricane impacts to the human, natural and
built environments in vulnerable communities throughout the United States and in
other  countries.  It  was  established  by  the  private  sector  in  the  aftermath  of  Hurri-
cane Andrew.

As  Florida’s  center  for  hurricane  research,  education  and  outreach,  the  IHRC  of-
fers a solid record of interdisciplinary and collaborative research, both basic and ap-
plied,  focusing  on  the  full  spectra  of  hurricane  impacts  and  the  methods  and  tech-
niques for hurricane loss reduction. The work of the IHRC has largely involved Flor-
ida and the larger Caribbean and Gulf basin, where most of the North Atlantic hur-
ricanes make landfall.

The  knowledge  and  findings  resulting  from  the  work  of  the  IHRC,  and  the  com-
plementary education and outreach methodologies benefit not only Florida and spe-
cific  countries  in  the  Caribbean  and  Latin  America,  but  every  hurricane  vulnerable
community  in  the  USA  and  abroad.  These  capabilities  clearly  allow  the  IHRC  to

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:23 Dec 13, 2008 Jkt 042964 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE08\062608\42964 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

65

support  federal  strategic  objectives  and  priorities,  providing  increased  assistance  to
international partners while concentrating on the domestic front.

In  fulfillment  of  its  mission,  the  IHRC  has  engaged  in  a  wide-ranging  research

agenda that includes the following areas:

• Research  and  development  of  effective  and  credible  hurricane  loss  reduction
methods  and  techniques  for  housing  in  Florida.  This  involves  the  testing  of
various  building  components  and  assemblies,  development  of  improved  build-
ing  design  criteria,  and  the  analysis  of  various  architectural  and  structural
elements and their role in modifying the performance of buildings under hur-
ricane  conditions.  IHRC  researchers  have  developed  an  innovative  full-scale
structural  testing  facility—the  Wall  of  Wind—to  determine  inherent  weak-
nesses  of  structures  when  subjected  to  hurricane-force  winds  and  rain.  This
research facility, the first-of-its-kind, will revolutionize our building construc-
tion and retrofitting practices. (Funded by Florida Department of Community
Affairs,  Florida  Division  of  Emergency  Management,  National  Science  Foun-
dation,  Florida  Sea  Grant,  Renaissance  Reinsurance  Holdings,  Ltd,  AIR
Worldwide.)

• Development  of  a  public  domain  hurricane  loss  model  to  assess  risk  and  esti-
mate potential losses. This integrated model is particularly useful to insurers,
re-insurers,  regulators  as  well  as  the  financial  and  housing  industries.  The
model  includes  newly-developed  knowledge  databases  and  an  updated  wind
field model. (Funded by Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.)

• Implementation of a windstorm simulation and modeling. This project focuses
on  the  use  of  high-resolution  data  acquisition  with  airborne  LIDAR  tech-
nology and IHRC-developed algorithms, enhanced storm surge modeling, com-
puter  simulation  and  visualization  complemented  by  public  education  and
outreach programs. (Funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.)

• Assessment  of  beach  erosion,  sea  level  rise  impacts  and  coastal  vulnerability.
Quantification and assessment of erosion resulting from hurricanes and long-
term  sea  level  rise  through  the  use  of  airborne  LIDAR  technology.  This
project  uses  high-resolution  elevation  data  and  local  geomorphology  features
to assess coastal vulnerability at specific locations. (Funded by National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.)

• Assessment of social consequences and the human impact of hurricanes. Eval-
uation of how various social factors such as demographics, socioeconomic stra-
ta or education may affect perceptions and attitudes influencing critical issues
such as hurricane evacuation and the use of mitigation measures. (Funded by
the  National  Science  Foundation,  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Admin-
istration, Florida Division of Emergency Management.)

To  complement  its  research  program,  the  IHRC  also  engages  in  efforts  of  edu-
cation  and  outreach  to  transfer  critical  knowledge  and  findings  to  potential  users
and policy-makers in various fields. This includes the Developing a Culture of Miti-
gation  through  Education  project  focusing  on  K–12  students,  their  parents  and
teachers, and the community at large.

The Need for a National Hurricane Research Agenda

Hurricanes have shredded every ounce of public belief and trust in the safety and
resiliency  of  community  life  by  not  only  destroying  people’s  homes,  but  everything
else  they  need  in  their  daily  lives—businesses,  schools,  hospitals,  gas  stations,  and
places of worship.

It  is  hard  to  identify  any  other  societal  need  or  engineering  problem  as  chal-
lenging,  recurring,  and  multi-disciplinary  as  hurricanes.  Among  weather  hazards,
hurricanes account for over half of the total damage inflicted.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Hurricane Cen-
ter,  located  on  FIU’s  campus,  predicts  the  six-month  2008  hurricane  season  which
began  June  1st  has  a  65  percent  probability  of  being  above  normal,  with  12  to  16
named  storms,  including  six  to  nine  hurricanes  and  two  to  five  major  hurricanes
with  winds  in  excess  of  111  mph.  William  M.  Gray,  a  noted  hurricane  expert  from
Colorado  State  University,  in  April  predicted  a  ‘‘well  above-normal’’  season  with  15
named  storms,  eight  of  them  becoming  hurricanes  when  they  grow  to  74  mph  or
more, and four developing into major-hurricane intensity.

FIU  believes  the  following  provide  compelling  evidence  of  the  critical  need  for

prompt congressional enactment of a national hurricane research initiative:

1,800 fatalities.

U.S., with the potential to affect every state from Maine to Texas.

• Hurricanes  represent  65  percent  of  insured  losses  by  natural  hazards  in  the
• In 2004 the value of insured coastal properties in the 18 East Coast and Gulf
states  exposed  to  hurricanes  totaled  $6.9  trillion,  or  16  percent  of  insurers’
total exposure to loss in the U.S.
• In  2005  alone,  hurricane  losses  surpassed  $80  billion  and  caused  more  than
• Analyses  of  the  top  40  most  costly  insurance  losses  worldwide  for  1970–2005
indicate  that  $147  billion  in  worldwide  insured  losses  were  associated  with
hurricanes  compared  to  $25  billion  for  earthquakes.  Over  the  last  five  years,
actual  economic  losses  from  U.S.  hurricanes  alone  are  estimated  to  be  $179
billion (in constant 2006 dollars).
• If  a  hurricane  of  the  same  category  as  Hurricane  Andrew  which  hit  South
Florida in 1992 would hit Miami directly, it could be a $100+ billion disaster,
comparable to the physical damage New York suffered as a result of 9/11.
• Fifty  percent  of  the  U.S.  population  lives  within  50  miles  of  the  coastline,
where  the  physical  infrastructure  in  the  late  1990s  was  valued  at  about  $3
trillion in the Gulf and Atlantic regions alone.
• If  a  hurricane  caused  permanent  closure  of  only  one  percent  of  businesses  in
South  Florida,  13,500  jobs  would  be  lost  in  addition  to  $1.8  billion  in  sales
and  $414  million  in  lost  payroll.  By  comparison,  Hurricane  Andrew  perma-
nently  closed  10  percent  of  the  businesses  in  the  area.  We  believe  similar
losses would occur in other densely populated areas along the Gulf Coast and
Atlantic Ocean.
• In  Florida,  estimates  show  that  only  35  percent  of  small  and  mid-sized  busi-
nesses  have  a  disaster  recovery  plan  in  place,  and  less  than  10  percent  have
contingency,  business  recovery  and  resumption  plans,  despite  studies  that
show that 40 percent of companies that were shut by a disaster for three days
failed within 36 months.
• FIU  has  a  Wall  of  Wind  test  facility  that  enables  development  of  innovative,
high  performance  building  systems  and  structures  capable  of  withstanding
hurricanes as intense as Category 5 and performance-based evaluation of two-
story  buildings,  including  residences,  low-rise  commercial  buildings,  schools,
power lines, traffic signals, gas stations, commodity stores, focusing on issues
of sustainable community and business continuity.
• In  advance  of  Hurricane  Katrina’s  landfall  a  29-foot  storm  surge  in  Mis-
sissippi was predicted by FIU researchers. The CEST storm surge model, cur-
rently  under  development,  proved  highly  accurate  and  will  continue  to  be  a
major asset to vulnerable regions as emergency managers will have additional
tools to predict flooding potential. University of South Florida and University
of  West  Florida  have  recently  joined  the  Hurricane  Mitigation  Alliance  and
aid in this research effort.
• IHRC researchers developed the first dynamic model of hurricane evacuation
behavior.  This  multi-period  model  can  address  questions  such  as  how  levels
of  evacuation  might  be  affected  by  an  improved  three-day  vs.  two-day  fore-
cast,  extended  hurricane  warning,  reduced  costs  of  evacuation,  and  reduced
benefits of evacuation.
• Real-time hurricane track forecasts were made available through the FIU-led
Hurricane  Mitigation  Alliance  to  the  National  Hurricane  Center  by  Florida
State University using their super-ensemble model.
• The  University  of  Florida  and  FIU  team  of  wind  engineers  used  meteorolog-
ical towers to intercept landfalling hurricanes during the 2004 and 2005 hur-
ricane seasons. This real-time, surface data characterizes the winds that actu-
ally cause damage. A highlight of the 2004 season was first-ever recording of
surface  wind  during  passage  of  the  hurricane  eyewall,  and  forecasters  at  the
National Hurricane Center based advisories upon these data.
• FIU  scientists,  working  with  colleagues  at  NOAA’s  Hurricane  Research  Divi-
sion,  formulated  a  new  analytical  model  of  hurricanes’  horizontal  structure
based upon aircraft observations. This research will lead to more realistic as-
sessment of windstorm underwriting risk and more accurate storm-surge fore-
casts.
• University  of  Central  Florida  has  built  building  virtual  models  of  the  effects
of  hurricane  wind  forces  on  residential  houses  as  funded  through  FIU-led
Hurricane  Mitigation  Alliance.  The  models  include  visualization  of  different

types  of  damage  to  different  types  of  structures  (for  example  concrete  block
vs. wood frame structures), which will be used in educational programs.

Adoption  and  adequate  funding  of  the  NSB  plan  can  result  in  as  much

as a 50 percent reduction in costs of hurricanes.

FIU’s  Comments  on  the  NSB  Report,  ‘‘Hurricane  Warning:  The  Critical

Need for National Hurricane Initiative’’

FIU and its Alliance colleagues have been vocal critics of the woefully inadequate
attention  that  hurricane  science,  research  and  education  have  received  at  the  fed-
eral  level.  The  university  wholeheartedly  agrees  with  the  NSB  that  ‘‘The  present
federal investment in hurricane science and engineering research relative to the tre-
mendous damage and suffering caused by hurricanes is insufficient, and time is not
on our side.’’ We concur with the NSB that hurricane-related research has been con-
ducted, for the most part, as a relatively modest, loosely coordinated enterprise, but
we  leave  to  others  to  determine  the  amount  of  annual  funding  necessary  to  imple-
ment  a  meaningful,  successful  program  to  reduce  the  enormous  public  outlays,  loss
of life, and the associated societal disruption caused by hurricanes.

FIU  also  agrees  with  the  NSB  that  any  legislative  National  Hurricane  Research
Initiative  be  a  ‘‘focused  activity,  with  well  defined  metrics  for  success,  effective  as-
sessment  mechanisms  and  a  clearly  articulated  pathway  from  research  to  oper-
ations.’’  Finally,  we  share  the  NSB’s  conclusion  that  time  is  not  on  our  side  with
respect  to  the  federal  investment  in  hurricane  science  and  engineering,  as  hurri-
canes are an inevitable part of our future. Our nation simply cannot afford the sta-
tus  quo.  Added  to  the  huge  financial  cost  is  the  intolerable  and  unnecessary  loss
of life associated with hurricanes.

FIU  has  carefully  reviewed  the  ‘‘Research  Imperatives’’  identified  as  priorities  in
the  NSB  report  and  have  the  following  comments  noted  in  black  type  with  respect
to  level  of  urgency  given  by  the  NSB.  Also  provided  are  areas  not  addressed  in  the
NSB  report  that  we  believe  are  essential  and  should  be  included  in  H.R.  2407,  the
National Hurricane Research Initiative.
Investment Category #1: Understanding and Prediction
• High  priority.  Predicting  hurricane  intensification  and  size,  and  reducing  the  un-

FIU’s Specific Comments on H.R. 2407

FIU applauds this bill, which is comprehensive and addresses key research prior-
ities.  In  addition,  this  legislation  should  include  socioeconomic  research  and  imple-
mentation,  such  as  public  and  governmental  adoption  of  mitigation  measures  and
linking disaster recovery to mitigation. Our specific comments are as follows where-
in we give the highest priority ratings to those areas which have the greatest poten-
tial  for  breakthrough  science  and  return  on  investment  in  terms  of  mitigating
losses:

• Predicting hurricane intensity change—Highest priority
• Understanding ocean-atmosphere interactions—Medium priority
• Predicting storm surges and inland flooding—Highest priority
• Improved hurricane observations—High priority
• Assessing vulnerable infrastructure—Medium priority
• Understanding hurricane and structural interaction—Highest priority
• Assessing hurricanes and climate change—Medium priority
• Improving response and recovery technologies—Medium priority
• Evacuation planning—Medium priority
• Computation capability—Low priority

Conclusions

FIU  strongly  believes  in  the  need  for  coordinated  programs  at  the  federal  level
to  reduce  the  impacts  of  hurricanes  and  other  windstorms.  As  such,  FIU  has  been
a lead advocate of the 2004 National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act and strongly
urges  Congress  to  reauthorize  the  Act  this  year,  before  its  2008  authorization  expi-
ration.  We  are  heartened,  thanks  to  the  efforts  of  Reps.  Debbie  Wasserman  Schulz
(FL)  and  Dennis  Moore  (KS)  that  the  FY  ’08  Commerce,  Justice  Science  appropria-
tion  Conference  Report  includes  $11.3  million  to  implement  the  bill.  We  are  dis-
appointed  that  neither  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration,  the
National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  and  the  National  Science  Founda-
tion  has  chosen  to  fund  the  Act,  presumably  due  to  budget  shortfalls  and  different
priorities. FIU strongly urges the Committee to advise these agencies of the impor-
tance  of  the  National  Windstorm  Impact  Reduction  Act  and  to  make  implement  of
the 2004 Act a high agency priority.

If a hurricane of the same category as Hurricane Andrew (which hit South Florida
in  1992)  would  hit  Miami  directly,  it  would  be  a  $100+  billion  disaster,  comparable
to the physical damage New York suffered as a result of 9/11. While the size of the
national  hurricane  mitigation  research  program  that  the  National  Science  Board
outlined  is  significant,  it  only  represents  one  percent  of  the  present  value  of  the
damage caused by Hurricane Andrew. Our research shows that funding for a strong,
coherent  and  united  research  agenda,  such  as  that  embodied  in  H.R.  2047,  could
lead  to  significant  loss  reductions—in  lives  saved  and  structural  damage  incurred.

DISCUSSION

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Dr. Leatherman. I am sure that
Mr.  McNerney  would  be  happy  to  work  with  you  to  see  if  you
couldn’t  just  generate  some  windmills  that  would  capture  some  of
that  excess  wind  that  is  blown  over  there  and  generate  a  little  bit
more electricity to pay for that operation.

At  this  point  we  will  open  for  our  first  round  of  questions,  and

the Chairman will recognize himself for five minutes.

And  I  would  like  to  start  with  Dr.  Hayes.  H.R.  2407  establishes
a  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative  to  improve  hurricane
forecasting  and  preparedness.  Which  areas  of  this  research  initia-
tive  in  the  bill  is  NOAA  not  addressing  yet,  and  are  there  ways
that this bill can be improved?

Dr.  HAYES.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  all  the  weather-related
or hurricane-related pieces we are attempting to address right now.
I  think  we  are  stronger  in  some  areas  than  others.  I  think  clearly
our  expertise  is  operational  weather  prediction,  and  I  would  think
that those aspects associated with operational prediction we are ad-
dressing, and we are trying to address those in partnership. I think
where  we  recognize  certainly  a  need  for  help,  it  is  in  the  social
science area. NOAA has a Science Advisory Board, which has a So-
cial  Science  Subcommittee.  They  did  a  study  approximately  three,
maybe  four  years  ago,  and  they  are  updating  that  at  the  present
time.  And  I  think  the  remarks  I  heard  this  morning  indicate  that
while  we  produce  improved  forecasts  and  warnings,  if  we  can’t
translate  that  into  something  that  the  American  public,  that  the
emergency managers can use to effectively accomplish actions, then
we  have  not  taken  the  challenge  far  enough.  So  I  guess  if  there  is
an area where I think we would need help it is there.

On  the  research  side  we  have  our  lapses,  as  I  mentioned  in  my
testimony.  I  think  that  we  are  working  with  the  National  Science
Foundation, with NASA, with the Office of Naval Research, all fed-
eral  agencies  that  have  an  interest  in  tropical  cyclone  research.
And where we could use help is making that alliance a reality, and
it  is  just  a  resource  investment  to  all  federal  agencies  involved  in
that part of the problem.

Thank you.
Chairman LAMPSON. I understand that there is a need for better
research  and  understanding  hurricane  activity,  so  what  are  some
of  the  roadblocks  that  exist  to  better  hurricane  forecasting?  And
would better national coordination between the federal agencies as

you were just talking about help to break down some of those road-
blocks?

Dr. HAYES. Well, Mr. Chairman, I think certainly better observa-
tions.  If  one  looks,  our,  my  testimony  talks  about  rapid  intensity
change. One of the challenges scientifically that we face is that you
have processes going on in the center of a storm between the ocean
and the atmosphere, inside the eye wall of a hurricane, if you will,
that  we  are  not  even  observing.  So  I  think  certainly  observations.
NOAA  flies  aircraft  in  at  safe  altitudes,  but  getting  an  un-
manned  aerial  system  in  may  be  at  a  level  that  we  couldn’t  safety
fly a human in, and I am talking here maybe 100, 200 feet off the
surface  of  the  ocean,  would  see  some  of  the  dynamics  going  on  in
the storm.

So observations is an area that I think we could work better and
the Committee could help us with funding to improve observations
of the storms.

I  think  also  it  is  creating  an  infrastructure  that  allows  rapid
transition of what the university community is doing. We have sev-
eral  in  the  United  States  that  are  involved  in  tropical  cyclone  re-
search.  We  run  our  models  at  the  National  Centers  for  Environ-
mental Prediction, one of the constraints we have is that it doesn’t
exist  in  the  research  community,  is  a  need  to  meet  production
deadlines  for  emergency  managers,  for  the  American  public.  And
that  requires  a  very  operationally  tuned  environment,  and  there
are  differences  between  what  exists  in  our  national  centers  and
what exists in the Nation’s research facilities.

And so helping us with planning and transitioning that research
to  operations.  I  think  funding  is,  should  be  targeted  toward  that
transition step.

Thank you.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  What  areas  of  forecasting  is  NOAA  best
equipped, most equipped to handle, and what areas are covered by
other federal agencies?

Dr.  HAYES.  Well,  I,  again,  I  think  it  is  from  an  operational  per-
spective  it  is  observations,  operational  modeling,  detecting  the
presence  of  storms  using  our  satellites,  our  radars,  our  aircraft,
translating  those  observations  into  meaningful  operational  fore-
casts  the  public  can  use,  and  then  the  warnings  that  emergency
managers  and  the  public  could  use.  So,  I  think  those  are  our
strengths, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman LAMPSON. I recognize Mr. Inglis, Ranking Member, for

five minutes.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr.  Hayes,  I  suppose  that  the  weather  predictions  have  an  im-
pact  on  the  social  behaviors  surely  because,  having  grown  up  in  a
hurricane  area  at  the  coast  in  South  Carolina,  you  feel  silly  when
you pack up and leave and then you come home and there is noth-
ing  that  happened,  and  so  then  people  decide  to  stick  out  the  next
one, until they get a big one and then they forever more leave even
if it is a small one coming.

And  so  that  feedback  loop,  I  guess,  is,  if  you  leave  and  nothing
happened,  there  is  not  nary  a  piece  of  moss  in  the  yard  when  you
come home, you know, you decide not to leave the next time.

So,  I  guess  it  is  essential  to  try  to  better  the  forecast,  but  there
will be some limits on that. Right? I mean, there, I suppose we will
get better and better, but there still is some limit on the ability to
accurately  forecast  and  narrow  the  cone,  as  Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen  was
talking about.

Dr.  HAYES.  Mr.  Inglis,  I  think  if  you  look  at  our,  what  we  have
done over the past say 15 to 20 years, we have improved the hurri-
cane  track  forecasts,  reduced  error  by  a  factor  of  two.  I  think  with
finer-scale  models,  we  run  our  models  today  at  10  kilometers,  and
if we were able to get that modeled down to say a kilometer in res-
olution,  I  have  great  confidence  that,  using  our  global  models  and
our  regional  models,  we  could  achieve  that  in  the  next  10  years,
and that is what our plan calls for.

What that is going to require is probably, well, not probably, ap-
proximately an increase of about 1,000 or more times the high-per-
formance computing capacity that we have at the National Centers.
Earlier  speakers  talked  about  having  a  partnership  with  the  re-
search  community  to  leverage  high-performance  computing  in  the
universities, and we are prepared to do that. The unfortunate chal-
lenge  that  we  face  in  trying  to  do  that  is,  as  I  mentioned  earlier,
our  operational  modeling  structure  is  designed  to  work  in  real
time, and we have optimized it, and we have developed I would say
probably  over  a  billion  dollar  investment  in  our  National  Centers,
and it is a certain way. Our research institutions, by virtue of their
mission to do basic research, don’t operate under those constraints,
and  so  it  is  how  would  we  transition  our—what  we  have  in  oper-
ations to exploit that.

We  are  prepared  to  work  with  the  university  community  to  try
and  do  that.  It  is  not  going  to  be  an  easy  task.  We  are  also,  we
have ongoing discussions with Department of Energy. They have in
Oak  Ridge  high-performance  computing  assets,  which  we  think  we
might  be  able  to  leverage  in  both,  primarily  a  research  capacity,
and other federal agencies.

So, I think, Mr. Inglis, that is our, one of our big challenges, and
then  I  have  one  final  comment.  From  a  fundamental  science  per-
spective, I don’t think we know what causes rapid intensity change,
and  by  rapid  intensity  change  I  mean  a  hurricane  intensity  jump
by  Saffir-Simpson  Scale  of  over  one  category  in  a  24-hour  period.
Last  September  we  had  Hurricane  Humberto,  that  was  a  tropical
depression  in  the  early  afternoon,  and  within  18  hours  it  became
a  hurricane.  Right  off  the  coast  of  Louisiana  and  Texas.  I  heard
firsthand from the folks in Texas about how the energy community,
the  oil  community  scrambled.  And  the  thing  that  was  luckiest  for
us  was  that  it  only  reached  minimal  hurricane  strength,  65  knots,
before it moved to shore.

My  fear  is  something  like  that  happening  a  little  bit  further  out
in  the  Gulf  and  then  picking  up  some  speed  and  come  crashing
ashore  and  then  have  another  Katrina  where  we  have  a  category
or a two-category jump in 24 hours.

Fundamentally, research is required to understand what is caus-
ing  these  storms  to  increase  in  intensity  so  rapidly,  and  then  on
the flip side it was mentioned that we, and you mentioned that we
lose  credibility  when  we  over-warn  the  public.  I  can  remember  in
the  earlier  part  of  this  decade  where  we  hit  and  nailed  a  tropical

storm coming into the coast of Louisiana. The unfortunate thing is
we  said  it  is  going  to  be  a  category  three,  and  by  the  time  it  got
to  Louisiana  it  was  a  category  one.  People  then  begin  to  say,  they
are not right often enough, so I don’t need to take any action.

So,  I  think  hurricane  intensity  and  rapid  intensity  change  is  a

tough scientific problem where we need the research community.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  you,  the  funding  here  that  I  mentioned  earlier,
$4.17 billion over 10 years, that is a lot of money, and so I wonder
if  you  have  any  thoughts  about  how  much  assistance  you  get  in
those goals you were just describing by the additional funding?

Dr.  HAYES.  Well,  I  think  that  my  focus  in  the  Weather  Service
is  to  orient  our  architecture,  our  work  processes.  I  think  we  truly
believe  this  is  a  national  problem,  and  I  think  my  commitment
isn’t, and I think NOAA’s commitment is not to necessarily say we
invented it. It is to say where it can help America, we are prepared
to  use  it  operationally,  and  I  think  that  is  my  commitment  to  this
committee and to the American public.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Inglis.
Dr. Baird, you are recognized.
Mr. BAIRD. I thank the Chair.
I want to follow up on the theme raised by my friend, Mr. Inglis,
a  second  ago,  and  that  is  the  funding  aspect  of  this  bill,  the  re-
quested amount is pretty large. And I would ask each of you, if you
had  to  prioritize  the  most  important  areas,  if  you  had  some  extra
funding, where do you think the most important areas are in order
to reduce and do it fairly quickly for us, and I will just go from Dr.
Hayes  on  down  to  each  person.  Very  quickly.  The  most  important
areas  where  we  should  allocate  funding.  In  other  words,  without
duplicating what is already being done, et cetera.

Dr. HAYES. Mr. Baird, I think if we are looking for rapid impact,
I  mentioned  we  run  our  models  at  ten  kilometers,  if  I  had  signifi-
cantly  more  operational  high-performance  computing,  then  it  is  a
matter  of  taking  the  models  I  have  and  then  just  changing  the
code,  which  can  be  done  fairly  quickly  to  run,  and  right  now  that
is a constraint that I have. For every time you increase the resolu-
tion  by  a  fact  or  two,  you  increase  your  high-performance  com-
puting  requirements  by  a  factor  of  about  ten.  So,  that  is  where  I
got the 1,000 times to get from ten to one kilometer.

Dr.  DROEGEMEIER.  I  believe  really  the  best  investment  would  be
two-fold. One is in terms of applying the current engineering prac-
tices  that  we  have  and  in  studying  new  ones  but  also  the  commu-
nicating  information  to  the  public.  The  social  science  research
agenda is very, very important.

I agree completely with Dr. Hayes that we need to be doing more
in the area of meteorology, but I think that the forecasts are quite
good  now,  and  I  think  we  could  get  a  quick  benefit  if  we  actually
understand how to better communicate the information, get people
to respond appropriately, and help them actually get out of harm’s
way. In fact, in Katrina and Rita a lot of the loss of life was people
simply were immobile for a variety of reasons. And so I think those
are  very  important,  again,  not  to  diminish  any  other  elements  of
the components of the effort. But as you say, the priorities, I think,
for a quick return would be those.

Mr. BAIRD. Thanks, Dr. Droegemeier. Dr. Chen.
Dr.  CHEN.  I  would  like  to  emphasize  a  point,  we  refer  to  the
rapid  intensification  forecast  that  has  been  stagnant  over  the  last
15  years  for  the  reason  the  complexity  that  you  need  basic  re-
search.  The  research  community  have  developed  the  next  genera-
tion forecast model and kilometer resolution already, and that tech-
nology  can  be  explored  and  moving  over  to  operations  more  effec-
tively.  And  that  also  relates  to  the  forecasts,  not  only  the  location
of  where  landfall  occurs  but  a  detailed  forecast  of  extreme  winds
and  rain.  That  will  help  the  mitigation  and  the  many  other  areas,
risk assessment.

So  this  new  generation  model  in  research  community  really
needs to be, continue to be supported and then translation to oper-
ation. That is a very urgent area that we can help.

Mr. BAIRD. Dr. Prevatt.
Dr.  PREVATT.  I  believe  the  two  areas,  social  interactions  and  so
on, but most importantly it is improving our performance of our ex-
isting  buildings  and  our  existing  structures.  How  do  structures
interact  with  wind,  how  do  structures  interact  with  storm  surges
and  inland  flooding?  Preparation  begins  not  when  we  have  24-
hours  notice.  Preparation  begins  what  we  put  down  in  the  ground
today,  what  we  do  about  what  is  existing  and  improving  those
things.

There is no reason why we should have a situation in which peo-
ple  have  to  be  scared  for  their  homes  in  a  category  one  hurricane.
We know how to build it. It is a matter of actually doing that, get-
ting the research that allows us to improve our civil infrastructure.

Mr. BAIRD. Dr. Leatherman.
Dr.  LEATHERMAN.  I  think  the  full-scale  testing  as  we  just  heard
in  terms  of  making  our  houses  stronger.  We  have  got  to  do  that.
We  can  do  that  right  away,  and  it  has  got  to  be  the  first  invest-
ment  I  think  we  have  got  to  make,  because  after  all,  the  wind  is
doing  so  much  damage.  Every  hurricane  is  a  billion  dollar  event
plus.  Most  people  are  saying  now  they  are  five  billion  a  piece  or
more. The last, 2004, 2005, those hurricanes now are on the top ten
list  most  of  them.  So  what  are  we  saying?  Just  the  damages  are
going out of sight.

Secondly,  I  think  that  we  can  make  big  improvements  to  the
storm  surge  models  and  actually  run  in  a  suite  of  models,  storm
surge  models  as  the  National  Hurricane  Center  runs  a  suite,  a
forecast  model.  They  presently  use  15  models,  which  they  use  to
look  at  and  make  their  determination  where  the  best  track.  Right
now we are relying upon one storm surge model that was developed
by  Chester  Jalanski,  a  great  model,  some  20,  30  years  ago.  And
that is really, we are way behind on that.

And  finally,  I  think  the  social  science,  I  mentioned  one  aspect  of
that  is  a  quantitative  model  that  was  recently  being  developed
where  we  could  understand  why  people  make  decisions  in  a  quan-
titative  sense,  and  it  is  a  numerical  model,  which  I  think  it  fits  in
perfectly and meshes with the storm surge model, because after all,
as  we  say,  you  hide  from  the  wind,  and  you  run  from  the  water.
And that is where people drown is in the water. That is where peo-
ple  are  really  killed,  and  that  is  what  we  need  to  know,  and  we
need  to  mesh  that  new  high  resolution  storm  surge  models  with

this  quantitative  evacuation  model.  And  that  is  how  we  can  save
lives,  but  most  of  the  damage,  sparing  New  Orleans,  what  hap-
pened with the break in the levees, was, in fact, and is wind dam-
age to our houses and buildings, and that is just out of sight.

So we’ve got ways now to do the full-scale testing and know how
to build better, and not only that, retrofit the 99 percent of the ex-
isting  houses  that  are  out  there  in  cost-effective  ways  such  as  the
new  technologies  that  Dupont  and  3M  and  other  countries  are  de-
veloping, but it has to be tested and shown to work.

Thank you.
Mr.  BAIRD.  Very  helpful.  It  seems  that  what  we  need  is  some
combination  of  factors  where  we  improve  our  prediction  and  then
you  can  translate  that  to  individual  buildings  and  homeowners
with their location and say, this is what we predict is about to hap-
pen.  This  is  the  risk  you  face,  this  is  the  preparedness  of  your
building  or  structure  that  you  are  in,  and  then  somehow  commu-
nicate that in a meaningful way so that they can, the average indi-
vidual can do something about that in a responsible way, both well
beforehand as Dr. Prevatt said, but then base their immediate real-
time  decisions  on  what  they  have  done  and  what,  the  threats  they
face.

Thanks for the succinct answers. I yield back. Thanks.

tions  have  been  answered,  but  a  few  I  would  like  to  follow  up  on.
Years  ago  we  sustained  very  substantial  amounts  of  earthquake
damage  in  this  country.  We  instituted  earthquake  modeling  pro-
grams, lots of research. We strengthened the building codes. Today
we  can  take  a  very  substantial  earthquake  with  not  a  great  deal
of damage.

Similar  in  the  Midwest  where  I  live,  this  same  thing  with  snow
loads,  straight  wind  problems,  and  so  forth.  We  have  changed  all
the building codes, and we really have fairly minor damage unless
a tree falls on the house.

I  have  been  surprised  every  time  we  read  about  the  hurricanes,
people  talk  about,  well,  we  need  better  building  codes,  and  the  in-
surance companies say, we are not going to give you insurance un-
less you have better building codes. And they don’t seem to happen.
Is my outsider’s perception wrong, or is there just too much delay
on  strengthening  the  building  codes,  or  do  people  simply  not  know
enough about what to do in the building code?

Dr.  Prevatt,  I  think  you  are  the  engineer  who  has  dealt  with
this. What are your comments? And then anyone else can jump in,
too.

Dr.  PREVATT.  You  hit  the  nail  on  the  head  there,  because  it  is
the tremendous investment that we have placed in research and in
the  earthquake  engineering  environment  that  has  improved  our
work  and  the  success  of  large  earthquakes.  We  learned  a  lot  since
1989.

In  our  case  wind  engineers,  civil  engineers  have  been  working
since Hurricane Camille in 1969, and we have been saying and say-
ing  over  and  over  that  we  don’t  understand  the  dynamics,  how  a

dynamic  wind  effect  affects  a  structure.  We  do  not  understand  the
basic engineering, even of a simple light-frame wood structure. And
these are the issues that we need to focus on to improve the build-
ing codes.

My  testimony  did  indicate  that  there  is  a  lot  of  work  to  be  done
for  us  to  really  have  a  building  code  that  is  probabilistically  based
on that which we can rely on. A lot of the construction that we use
today is based on traditional construction practice.

What  I  learned  from  my  dad  and  what  he  learned  from  his  dad.
And this has been, you know, in our codes today. What we do need,
in  fact,  is  to  get  the  engineering,  the  actual  forces,  we  need  struc-
tural  testing  that  simulates  not  just  an  individual  window  compo-
nent  or  a  door  component,  but  as  Dr.  Leatherman  says,  we  need
to put all components together in a holistic, three-dimensional test
situation and see what happens at the interfaces of those.

Mr. EHLERS. Dr. Leatherman, do you want to add something?
Dr.  LEATHERMAN.  Yes.  I  totally  agree  with  him.  I  mean,  if  you
look  at  buildings,  they  are  very  complicated,  and  how  do  things
fail?  You  can  test  an  individual  window  or  a  door,  but  really  the
structure fails in a holistic way, as a whole, and we never had that
capability  before.  So,  if  you  talk  about  building  codes,  there  is  a
problem  because  what  do  you  do  now?  What  is,  where  is  the  em-
phasis  going  to  go,  and  a  lot  of  times  we  don’t  know.  Now  we  can
say,  oh,  everybody  should  live  in  a  bunker  or  live  in  a  cave,  a  for-
tified  fortress,  but,  you  know,  people  aren’t  going  to  do  that,  it  is
too expensive, and so there is that ultimate solution you might say,
and that, and there is also how we are living today.

And  we  have  got  to  find  something  that  makes  sense  economi-
cally  for  people  to  do,  because  after  all,  in  terms  of  building  stock,
it  is  98,  99  percent  out  there  and  built.  We  got  to  find  a  way  to
retrofit  those  existing  buildings  in  a  cost-effective  way  so  we  can
bring  them  up  to  withstand  at  least  a  category  three  hurricane.
And I think that is what we are trying to do.

up.

And so, and of course, improve the new structures that are going

Mr.  EHLERS.  Don’t  you  already  know  enough  to  at  least  get  this
building  code  process  started?  I  was  struck,  I  think  it  was  Hugo,
but  I  am  not  sure,  when  I  saw  the  photograph  of  a  number  of
houses without roofs and right next to them or mixed in with them
a number of houses with roofs. And the ones that still had the roofs
had been built by Habitat for Humanity volunteers, and the others
had  been  built  by  builders  who  used  the  guns,  when  you  can’t  al-
ways tell whether you are actually getting it into the rafter or not.
I  mean,  that  is  a  fairly  simple  thing  to  correct.  Can’t  you  start
somewhere?  Or  do  you  really  have  to  build  a  complete  model  first
before you can really change the buildings?

Dr. PREVATT. I think we have started. We definitely have started,
but  in  addition  to  the  engineering  part  of  it,  there  is  the  enforce-
ment  part  of  it.  However,  if  we  have  a  situation  where  your  struc-
ture  is  dependent  on  a  hit  or  miss  situation  of  you  getting  these
things, perhaps we are dealing with the wrong type of structure for
a  significant  risk  of  damage.  And  those  are  the  issues.  The  issues
that  I  face  is  trying  to  convince  people  when  they  are  re-roofing
their  homes  to  put  in,  you  know,  another  set  of  nails.  Increasing

the  number  of  nails  that  you  have  in  your  roof  from  a  twelve-inch
spacing to a six-inch spacing will significantly increase the sustain-
ability of your home.

However,  if  you  do  that  without  looking  at  the  entire  load  chain
where the roof fits on the wall, where the wall fits onto the founda-
tion,  you  are  still  going  to  be  in  jeopardy,  and  my  research  has
been trying to retrofit existing homes in the Port Orange area, and
we  have  done  some  other  homes  in  Bartow,  Florida,  and  other
places. What you find is you cannot just do one part of the problem.
You  have  to  address  it  all  the  way  through.  And  without  that  you
risk keeping the roof on but then you lose the entire roof structure
itself.

Mr. EHLERS. Dr. Leatherman.
Dr.  LEATHERMAN.  If  I  may  also  add  to  that,  we  saw  in  the  2004
hurricanes  that  hit  Florida,  even  when  the  roofs  stayed  on  with
category  two  and  three  hurricanes,  still  significant  damage  to  the
water coming in, going through the soffits, going through the water
barriers, so-called water barriers. Once that water gets in, the ceil-
ings  saturate,  they  collapse.  The  walls  fill  up,  the  drywall  has  to
come  out,  the  furniture,  the  clothes  are  all  destroyed.  You  have  a
total  loss.  You  have  to  gut  that  house,  even  if  the  roof  stayed  on.
So,  this  is  a  lot  more  complicated  than  people  think,  and  most
of  these  soffits,  as  you  know,  are  underneath  the  overhang,  which
is  really  more  of  a  cosmetic  feature.  We  got  to  find  a  way  to  make
those  things,  at  least  in  hurricane  alley,  so  they  don’t  blow  out  or
at  least  they  limit  the  water.  We  are  working  on  that,  but  that  is
not as simple as it seems, because we need the air to get in under-
neath  there  so  the  roof  doesn’t  get  so  hot.  This  is  important  in
terms of energy conservation and also the longevity of your roof.

So,  there  is  a  lot  of,  it  is  a  real  balancing  act  here.  It  all  sounds
very simple in one sense, but then you get down to the details, the
devil  is  in  the  details  you  might  say.  And  so  these  are  the  things
that  we  are  working  on,  and  we  are  now  learning  things  through
the  full-scale  testing,  but  we  are  not  there  yet.  But  we  can  see  we
can get there through adequate type of funding and attention.

Thank you.
Mr. EHLERS. Thank you very much.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Dr. Ehlers.
Dr. Bartlett, you are recognized for five minutes. Less if possible.
Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much.
In  a  former  life  among  other  things  I  was  a  home  builder,  and
I  think  that  we  have  some  real  opportunities  for  changing  these
homes  after  a  hurricane,  and  you  have  to  take  off  the  drywall  and
so forth, because then you can do the kinds of things that are quite
impossible with an intact home. And you can’t go up and put hurri-
cane ties between the rafters and the upper plate in an intact home
very well. But once you have torn off all the drywall, why, you can
do that.

Another  thing  that  occurred  to  me  is  that  for  homes  in  hurri-
cane-prone  areas  we  maybe  ought  to  be  looking  at  different  kinds
of  materials.  There  is  nothing  worse  than  a  wet  vat  of  fiberglass
insulation. It just stays that way almost forever, and it may be that
we need to insulate those houses differently. There are insulations

77

which will not wet. A lot of cellular foams and so forth that it will
not wet so that they will dry out almost immediately.

So,  there  are  a  lot  of  things  we  can  do,  not  just  in  the  way  we
build  the  houses,  but  in  the  materials  we  use  for  houses.  It  costs
very  little  more,  for  instance,  to  use  treated  materials  in  building
a  house.  The  differential  in  costs  on  a  grand  scale  is  not  all  that
much. I know there is the potential for some out-gassing problems.
You  better  seal  your  home  on  the  inside  anyhow,  because  there  is
a  lot  of  out-gassing  from  OSB  and  things  like  that  with  the  glues
that are used.

I  have  one  technical  question  since  Dr.  Ehlers  said  most  of  the
questions I would have asked have already been asked. That is one
of  the  advantages  of  being  late  in  the  queue.  I  have  a  technical
question. For every reaction there is a reaction, and Dr. Hayes, you
mentioned the difficulty of predicting these very short surges going
from a category one to a two just very quickly.

Where  does  all  this  energy  come  from?  To  every  action  there  is
a reaction, and could we do a little better in understanding how we
get  this  enormous  increases  in  energy?  And  I  hear  that  for  every
few  minutes  in  a  hurricane  the  energy  released  is  equivalent  of  a
hydrogen  bomb  going  off.  So,  there  are  huge  amounts  of  energy
there.

What is the reaction to this action of the hurricane?
Dr.  HAYES.  Well,  Congressman,  I  think  there  are  a  complex  set
of  forcing  functions  that  cause  these  rapid  changes.  I  think  we
know  conceptually  that  the  heat  or  the  heat  content  in  the  lower
part  or  in  the  upper  part  of  the  ocean,  because  that  is  what  really
drives  hurricane  intensity.  It  is  the  evaporation,  when  you  evapo-
rate,  and  you  convert  that  into  heat,  that  drives  intensity  change.
There are just complex dynamics and thermodynamics inside the
eye  wall  itself  or  the  center  of  circulation  if  we  are  talking  a  trop-
ical cyclone, and I think that scientifically we just don’t understand
those, and I think when you talk the amount of energy, I think cer-
tainly  a  nuclear  weapon,  but  when  you  think  the  breadth  of  some
of  these  storms,  we  are  talking  hundreds  of  nautical  miles,  and  I
would  venture  a  guess  that  it  is  probably  well  in  excess  of  a  nu-
clear  weapon.  And  what  controls  the  rapid  change?  I  don’t  think
scientifically we know yet.

Mr. BARTLETT. Evaporation cools, of course.
Dr.  HAYES.  Yeah.  The  surface  of  the  ocean.  Yes.  Yes.  But  when
you  condense  that  evaporation  inside,  you  have  processes,  thermo-
dynamic  processes  which  convert  that  energy  into  heat,  which
drives the convection inside the store.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Yeah,  but  you  get  it  all  back  when  it  condenses,

of course.

Dr. HAYES. Yes.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Isn’t  it  a  fact,  I  think  water  has  an  incredibly  high

latent heat of fusion——

Dr. HAYES. Right.
Mr. EHLERS. And so it is an immense force.
Dr. HAYES. Yes.
Mr. EHLERS. Immense amount of energy.
Mr. BARTLETT. I fortunately live in an area that kind of benefits
from  hurricanes.  When  it  is  dry,  why  we  kind  of  look  for  the  tail

end  of  a  hurricane  which  will  bring  us  some  water.  In  Maryland
we don’t often get one that hits our shore, so we are kind of a bene-
ficiary  of  hurricanes  rather  than  a  victim  of  hurricanes,  because
many  times  our  crops  are  saved  by  a  late  season  hurricane  that
brings a lot of rain and very little wind and so forth.

But I remember Agnes, which caused in excess of 100-year flood-
ing  in  our  area,  and  so  we  can  be  affected  by  hurricanes,  but  we
didn’t have the wind force. It was just rain, rain, rain that we got.
And  is  most  of  the  damage  in  a  hurricane  done  by  the  wind  or

the water? From an insurance perspective.

Dr.  HAYES.  If  you  are  addressing  me,  Congressman,  I  would  say
it  is  the  storm  surge,  and  it  is  that  wall  of  water  that  is  going  to
come crashing ashore.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  But  if  you  are  not  on  the  shore,  what  is  the

biggest——

Dr. HAYES. Inland it would be inland flooding.
Mr. BARTLETT. Is it water or wind?
Dr. HAYES. It is water. It is water, I think.
Mr. BARTLETT. It is still water.
Dr. HAYES. I think so.
Mr. BARTLETT. Even when you are inland, it is still water. Yeah.
The  wind  does  the  damage  and  then  makes  it  possible  for  water
to get in, then water does the primary damage.

Dr.  CHEN.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  may,  I  would  like  to  add  a  point
there. The damage caused by hurricanes not only onshore, also the
offshore  for  instance,  the  energy  oil  wrecks  in  the  Gulf  and  many
of these been pushed down by Katrina and Rita. And a part of, be-
cause not only the highest wind and also gusts. The process we are
talking about here right now, it is not currently in the operational
model but it is coupled, modeled that in the research mode we are
looking at very detailed ocean impact and the winds.

And  these  are  down  to  meter  scales  now  that  we  are  hoping  to
transition  to  operations  that  can  address  exactly  the  problem  we
are looking at, the intensification, the wind, and wind damage.

Dr. PREVATT. I don’t believe, I believe Hurricane Andrew, for in-
stance, was the dramatic cost of that was wind damage, and Hurri-
canes  Charlie,  they  damaged  buildings  as  far  inland  as  Orlando,
we do recall Civic Center, evacuation center, which actually had its
roof collapse due to the wind.

So, the wind damage itself cannot be underestimated.
Dr.  LEATHERMAN.  Yes.  I  would  like  to  amplify  that  point.  Hurri-
cane Andrew was $30 billion in damage in 1992. It was 90 percent
wind damage. There was a surge, but it was limited in terms of the
damage  it  did,  even  though  it  was,  it  came  up  to  about  17.5  feet
at Burger King’s International Headquarters.

But, still, it was 90 percent more was wind damage, and also the
hurricanes  of  2004.  The  hurricanes  that  hit  Florida,  except  for
Ivan, they were mostly all wind damage. There was beach erosion,
there  was  some  local  flooding,  but,  again,  they  were  mostly  all,  I
think Katrina was probably the exception because the New Orleans
levies broke. That is when you got so much damage from the flood
waters  and  the  fact  of  the  30-foot  storm  surge  swept  inland  from
Mississippi for about 1,000 feet until it hit the railroad tracks and
stopped. And that is why you had so much damage there.

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Yes. Mr. Diaz-Balart, you are recognized for

five minutes. We got eight minutes left.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be——
Chairman LAMPSON. Six minutes left.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.—very  brief  because,  again,  most  of  the  things
that  I  was  thinking  about  also  were  answered,  but  I  wanted  to
thank all of you for being here.

Just briefly, when we talk about, you know, strengthening struc-
tures,  what  reasonably,  if  you  have  an  idea,  what  is  reasonable  to
expect, that people could expect to be able to strengthen a building,
a home with reasonable cost? Are we looking at a home being able
to  withstand  a  category  three,  category  four?  Is  there  any  way  to,
without building a bunker be able to withstand a category five? Or
is,  you  know,  so  what  is  reasonable  to  expect  in  some  time  in  the
future?

Dr.  PREVATT.  I  think  reasonably  we  should  expect  whatever  we
have  in  the  code,  which  is  140  mile-per-hour  wind  in  the  Miami,
150  Miami,  130  further  up.  We  should  expect  homes  to  withstand
that, and that is not just from the problems with the code that they
have  been  developed  primarily  from  a  life-safety  standpoint.  What
we  are  trying  to  address  here  now  is  building  codes  need  to  also
address  economic  losses,  the  losses  that  occur  well  below  100,  130,
140  miles  per  hour.  We  have  to  address  how  does  the  water  dam-
age  affect  things.  By  using  a  secondary  water  byway  installed  in
your  home  you  can  reduce  significantly  the  amount  of  water  dam-
age that occurs.

By developing better test methods for looking at the interface be-
tween a window and the wall structure itself. We can also develop
better  methods  for  developing  those  windows  which  have  a  water
penetration resistance, air resistance, as well as it stops the impact
of missiles, two by fours, and so on.

So, my sense is that currently we should be able to do the things
for the category three hurricane with no problem. The problems we
face,  however,  is  like  me,  I  have  just  moved  to  Florida.  I  have  a
1973  home.  I  know  I  don’t  have  a  hurricane-resistant  home,  but,
you  know,  when  I  ask  my  wife,  well,  should  we  buy  a  stove  or
should we put in hurricane ties, you know who is going to win. And
so  those  are  the  issues.  Ninety  percent  of  our  homes  are  built  this
way. How do we address that, and that is where the research needs
to address.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  And  if  I  may,  and  Dr.  Leatherman,  I  don’t
know,  because,  you  know,  I  am  thinking  of,  I  am  now  thinking  lo-
cally now. Homes that were built even after the strengthened code,
are  they  built  to  really  withstand  a  hurricane,  or  is  it  just,  you
know,  fortifying  some?  You  all  were  saying  a  little  while  ago  that
you have to have, it has got to be a holistic approach. You can have
a strong roof but still lose the entire home.

Are  they  built,  were  they  really  strengthened  to  the  point  of
being  really  hurricane  protected,  or  is  it  just  that  we  can  kind  of
feel  better  that  we  are  not  going  to  lose  a  roof,  but  we  are  going
to  get  flooded?  I  mean,  where  are  we  with  the  current  codes,
strengthened codes?

Dr. LEATHERMAN. Well, you are absolutely right. The codes have
been  strengthened  in  South  Florida  and  now  moving  throughout
the  State  of  Florida,  the  building  code  and  hopefully  the  Nation,
and  they  say  South  Florida  has  the  best  building  code  in  the  Na-
tion,  and  yet  we  saw  $16  billion  in  damage  from  barely  category
two Wilma.

So,  yes,  we  have  built  them  stronger,  but  we  still  have  a  lot  of
problems with the way we put roofs on. It turns out there was de-
fect  in  the  way  those  ridge  tiles  were  put  on  the  clay  tiles,  and  I
can tell you, I had to put a new roof on my house about five years
ago  and  got  supposedly  the  best  roofer  in  South  Florida  because
that is, the lawyers told me that who sue roofers. But any rate, and
yet  with  these  category,  with  Wilma,  I  lost  some  ridge  tiles,  and
I  talked  to  my  builder,  and  I  said,  what  in  the  world  is  going  on
here?  I  was  up  there  every  morning  when  he  was  working,  and  I
was  there  every  afternoon  when  I  got  off  from  work,  and  I  did  my
own inspection. Okay. And I said, what is going on? He says, well,
the code didn’t ask for the ridge tiles to have mechanical fasteners.
I  said,  well,  I  would  have  paid  you  if  you  told  me  at  the  time  that
is  what  we  needed.  He  said,  well,  you  know,  it  just  wasn’t  in  the
code. I was like, wow, you know. It was a learning situation for me,
and this was before we started the Wall of Wind, the full-scale test-
ing.  If  I  had  had  all  that  going  on,  believe  me,  we  would  have  put
up  a  two  by  four  or  some  other  thing  so  we  could  have,  you  know,
screwed  down  into  that  member  on  the  ridge  line,  because  once
those ridge lines go, it kind of opens up the structure.

So,  yes,  we  have  done  better,  but,  gosh,  there  is  some  glaring
mistakes  in  omissions  and  the  code  is  not  what  it  should  be,  and
again, people thought, well, this is good enough.

Now, the other thing you mentioned is I said before, you can still
get  water,  even  if  the  roof  stays  on.  People  are  going  to  aluminum
roofs, which are actually better. These metal roofs are doing better.
But the water can still get underneath and get in your house, and
you got a total loss from your insurance point of view if everything
is saturated. You have to strip it out to studs. That is a total loss.
Even if your roof is perfectly in tact.

So we have got to address these issues, and I think we have the

capability now to do them.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. We have got a long way to go it seems.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  We  do  indeed.  It  is  fascinating,  and  I  have
got more questions. I know others have more questions as well, but
we also have votes that are pending, and we have got a minute and
a half to get to the Floor to cast those votes.

I at some point in time want to even know about whether or not
we  have  the  capability  of  changing  the  temperature  of  water
enough  that  might  impact  a  storm  or  the  intensity  of  that  storm.
We can talk about it.

Let  me  just  thank  you  all  for  appearing  here  before  the  Sub-
committees today. Under the rules of the Committee the record will
be held open for two weeks for Members to submit additional state-
ments  and  any  additional  questions  that  they  might  have  for  the

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  John  L.  ‘‘Jack’’  Hayes,  Assistant  Administrator  for  Weather  Services;
Director, National Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration, U.S. Department of Commerce

Questions submitted by Chairman Brian Baird
Q1. As  you  and  many  of  the  witnesses  stated  in  their  testimony,  social  science  re-
search  plays  a  crucial  role  in  better  understanding  and  improving  hurricane
preparedness and response. What areas of social and behavioral science research
do you consider to be the highest priority areas? How are the results of such re-
search  being  translated  into  operational  practice?  Have  you  encountered,  or  are
you  aware  of  any  impediments  to  applying  the  findings  from  social  and  behav-
ioral sciences to disaster planning, recovery and response activities? If so, do you
have any suggestions as to how these impediments could be addressed?

A1. NOAA has focused on improving communication of information to support hur-
ricane  preparedness  and  response  as  a  priority  area  within  social  and  behavioral
science.  Through  the  American  Meteorological  Society,  we  are  engaging  the  entire
weather and climate enterprise to determine the best way to communicate our infor-
mation  to  ensure  people  understand  the  information  and  can  make  informed  deci-
sions,  resulting  in  appropriate  response  to  the  hazard.  We  are  engaging  the  social
science  community  as  we  develop  the  next  level  products  and  services  to  help
prioritize  areas  of  research  and  ensure  the  public  understands  the  information  we
provide—especially  our  forecasts  and  warnings—and  will  be  able  to  make  appro-
priate life saving decisions.

NOAA  is  also  collaborating  with  the  National  Science  Foundation  (Engineering
Directorate and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate) on a joint so-
licitation on Communicating Hurricane Information. This joint solicitation is an out-
come  of  a  three-year  development  of  a  Hurricane  Forecast  and  Warning  Social
Science  Research  agenda  involving  the  social  science  research  community  and  the
hurricane  research  and  operational  communities.  The  research  results  from  the  so-
licitation  will  inform  NOAA  on  improving  the  understanding  by  emergency  man-
agers and the public of its hurricane forecast and warning products.
Q2. In  his  testimony  Dr.  Prevatt  stated  that  increased  support  for  research  on
strengthening  the  existing  built  infrastructure  and  developing  cost  effective  ret-
rofit and mitigation measures would be the most effective way to reduce damage
and economic losses from hurricanes. Would you comment on what priority you
would  assign  to  such  research  and  development  efforts  within  the  context  of  a
national hurricane research program?

A2. NOAA  would  continue  to  work  with  our  partners  in  academia,  the  private  sec-
tor,  and  other  appropriate  federal  agencies  to  prioritize  research  and  development
efforts in areas of strengthening existing infrastructures and retrofit and mitigation
measures.  NOAA  participates  in  the  National  Windstorm  Impact  Reduction  Pro-
gram (NWRIP), enacted in 2004 (42 USC 15703 et seq.), which seeks to improve me-
teorological understanding of windstorms, quantify windstorm impacts, and identify
and promote cost-effective measures to reduce windstorm impacts. NWRIP identifies
the National Institutes of Standards and Technology as the lead within the Depart-
ment of Commerce.

Questions submitted by Representative Mario Diaz-Balart
Q1. There are a number of reports that speak to the urgency for improved hurricane
forecasts.  Your  own  statement  points  out  the  needs  for  such  research.  But  this
kind  of  research  is  quite  costly.  The  NSB  report  lists  appallingly  low  numbers
given  the  importance  of  the  research.  If  the  Administration  is  aware  of  the  ur-
gency for the research, why does it not request more funds from Congress?
a. What was the level of funding for hurricane research in the President’s FY09

budget request? What was it in FY08?

b. Do  you  believe  that  the  budget  requests  reflect  the  sense  of  urgency  that  you

describe in your testimony?

c. The authorizations set forth in this bill are total amounts. So, how should the
money  be  divided  between  NSF  and  NOAA  to  carry  out  the  initiative?  Are
other  ‘‘coordinating’’  federal  agencies  to  receive  part  of  the  funding  as  well?
Should they?

A1. Improving  hurricane  forecasting  is  a  top  priority  for  the  Administration  and
NOAA  is  implementing  this  commitment  with  an  emphasis  in  its  hurricane  pre-
diction and research. NOAA spends over $300 million a year for hurricane warning
and forecast efforts. Reflecting a sense of urgency for improved information, the FY
2009  President’s  Budget  includes  a  new  increase  of  $19.5  million  for  modeling  im-
provements,  research,  and  operations  across  NOAA.  In  the  FY  2008  President’s
Budget,  NOAA  requested  $10  million  for  hurricane  research.  To  further  expedite
these  efforts,  the  Administration  recently  submitted  to  Congress  a  FY  2009  budget
amendment for $13 million to support the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project.
The National Science Foundation and NOAA are formulating a cooperative agree-
ment  to  improve  hurricane  forecasting,  and  to  ensure  the  expertise  and  facilities  of
academic  and  research  institutions,  and  other  non-governmental  organizations  na-
tionwide,  are  leveraged  to  address  this  national-scope  challenge.  Funding  would  be
allocated in alignment with these enterprise priorities.
Q2. You  admit  that  the  hurricane  track  forecast  accuracy  has  increased  by  50  per-
cent  since  1990,  but  that  the  accuracy  of  intensity  forecasts  has  not  kept  pace.
a. Is  there  a  particular  reason  why  the  community  did  not  invest  time  and  ex-

pertise in intensity tracking?

b. Was  figuring  out  where  the  hurricane  was  going  considered  more  important
back  then  compared  with  the  ability  to  determine  the  intensity  of  the  hurri-
cane once it hit?

A2. It is critical to first know where the hurricane will go and then determine other
aspects of the storm. While complex in its own right, improving track forecasts was
an  aggressive  but  attainable  goal  given  the  state  of  the  science  and  computing  ca-
pacity. We are just now beginning to understand some of the physical processes oc-
curring within a hurricane as it changes in intensity. Complex atmospheric and sea
interactions  occur  on  a  much  smaller  scale  than  can  currently  be  incorporated  into
operational  models.  Our  priority  is  to  leverage  development  activities  in  the  re-
search  community  to  understand  and  forecast  hurricane  intensity  and  incorporate
successful  research  into  our  operations.  Additionally,  the  $13  million  provided  for
NOAA  in  the  recently  transmitted  budget  amendment  will  accelerate  planned  im-
provements in both hurricane track and hurricane intensity forecasts.
Q3. Many  different  offices  within  NOAA  have  experienced  similar  difficulties  of
transitioning  research  to  operations.  Is  that  the  intent  of  the  Joint  Hurricane
Testbeds?  What  do  you  think  is  necessary  to  facilitate  cooperation  between  the
research communities and the operations communities in order to reap the bene-
fits of the investment this bill proposed to spend on hurricane research?

A3. The  intent  behind  the  Joint  Hurricane  Testbeds  is  to  facilitate  the  transfer  of
research  to  operations.  Testbeds  provide  a  quasi-operational  environment  of  tools,
techniques and models, along with the infrastructure to facilitate the transfer of re-
search  applications  into  the  operational  arena.  To  better  reap  the  benefits  of  hurri-
cane  research,  we  believe  it  is  critical  to  have  a  coordinated  federal,  academic,  and
private sector effort, with the goal of incorporating demonstrated improvements into
operations.  Testbeds  are  one  component  of  this  coordinated  effort  and  the  following
are relevant to improve hurricane forecasting:

• NOAA’s  Joint  Hurricane  Testbed  that  is  funded  through  the  U.S.  Weather
Research  Program.  The  Joint  Hurricane  Testbed  supports  the  testing  and
transfer  of  research  to  operations  by  the  Hurricane  Research  Division  of
NOAA  and  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center/National  Hurricane  Center  in
Miami.
• The Developmental Testbed Center, also known as the Weather Research and
Forecasting  Model  testbed,  supports  the  testing  and  transfer  of  research  to
operations of numerical weather prediction of the Earth’s atmosphere, includ-
ing tropical cyclones.
• The DOD–NASA–NOAA Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation supports
critical efforts to improve our models by improving our ability to provide large
amounts of high quality satellite observational data for them, resulting in the
best  analysis  of  atmospheric  conditions.  Developing  the  best  model  analysis
of  the  initial  state  of  the  atmosphere,  including  cyclone  structure,  results  in
the  best  model  predictions  of  the  atmosphere  and  better  hurricane  pre-
dictions.

Q4. Are  there  currently  any  interagency  collaborative  efforts  between  NSF,  NOAA
and  any  other  agencies  on  hurricane  research?  If  so,  please  explain  the  nature

86

of  these  collaborations.  How  well  do  NSF  and  NOAA  work  together  in  this  re-
gard?

A4. The  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  and  NOAA  are  formulating  a  coopera-
tive agreement to improve hurricane forecasting and to ensure the expertise and fa-
cilities of academic and research institutions and other non-governmental organiza-
tions  nationwide  are  leveraged  to  address  this  national  challenge.  NSF  is  focused
on  basic  research.  NOAA  has  an  operational  research  focus  with  near-term  payoff
for  improved  operational  forecasts.  In  addition  to  specific  coordination  of  NSF  and
NOAA  research  programs,  the  Federal  Coordinator  for  Meteorological  Services  and
Supporting Research coordinates Federal Hurricane Operations and Research efforts
across  responsible  federal  agencies.  Other  federal  collaborative  efforts  supporting
the  overall  hurricane  research  effort  include  the  National  Ocean  Partnership  Pro-
gram and the U.S. Weather Research Program.
Q5. You state in your testimony that in the past year, NOAA has developed the Hur-
ricane  Forecast  Improvement  Project  to  focus  your  efforts  on  improved  forecasts
of  track,  intensity,  wind  fields,  and  storm  surges.  Considering  that  many  of
these  improvements  require  significant  research,  not  all  of  which  will  or  should
be done in house at NOAA, did you collaborate with other agencies in the devel-
opment of the project?

A5. The  Hurricane  Forecast  Improvement  Project  incorporates  the  planning  efforts
of: the NOAA Science Advisory Board Hurricane Intensity Research Working Group;
the 2006 report of the National Science Foundation (NSF) National Science Board—
Hurricane Warning: The Critical Need for a National Hurricane Research Initiative;
the  2007  report  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  Federal  Coordinator  of  Meteorological
Services and Supporting Research (OFCM)—Interagency Strategic Research Plan for
Tropical Cyclones—The Way Ahead. These three elements represented a cross-agen-
cy collaboration and incorporated academic vision as well.

NOAA  is  currently  engaging  with  other  key  federal  agencies,  including  NSF,  the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Energy, and the
Navy  (including  the  Office  of  Naval  Research)  to  develop  a  National  Hurricane  Re-
search  Alliance.  This  alliance  will  leverage  existing  federal  hurricane  coordination
efforts, including those from the OFCM, to manage overall roles and responsibilities
(including  those  of  the  broader  academic  community  funded  by  NSF,  NOAA,  and
others),  and  priorities  of  the  broad  set  of  activities  necessary  to  improve  overall  ac-
curacy and reliability of hurricane forecasts. Through this Alliance, NOAA will work
with the other agencies to maximize the effective use of these considerable non-fed-
eral  assets  in  conducting  the  Initiative’s  fundamental  research,  and  in  developing
and disseminating related products and services.
Q6. I  notice  that  the  NOAA  testimony  does  not  mention  the  collaboration  between
NSF (Engineering Directorate and Social, Behavioral and Economic sciences di-
rectorate)  and  NOAA  on  the  joint  solicitation  on  Communicating  Hurricane  In-
formation. Could you please speak to this new initiative?

A6. This  joint  solicitation  is  an  outcome  of  a  multi-year  discussion  between  NOAA
and NSF. The solicitation is funding research that advances basic information about
how  people  and  organizations  understand  and  use  warning  messages.  The  testbed
for this research is hurricane warnings. The effort is jointly led by NOAA and NSF
and  is  largely  funded  by  NSF.  The  first  awards  were  made  in  early  July.  The  joint
solicitation  required  there  be  at  least  one  investigator  from  the  physical,  natural,
or engineering sciences and one from the social sciences to ensure cross disciplinary
collaboration.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Kelvin  K.  Droegemeier,  Professor  of  Meteorology,  University  of  Okla-
homa; Member, National Science Board; Co-Chair, National Science Board Task
Force on Hurricane Science and Engineering

Questions submitted by Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. Does NOAA’s Hurricane Forecasting Improvement Plan address the concerns in
the National Science Board Report? If not, what else needs to be done to improve
NOAA’s Plan?

A1. The  NOAA  Plan  focuses  on  one  of  a  broad  range  of  concerns—hurricane  fore-
casting—articulated by the Board as needed in a comprehensive National Hurricane
Research Initiative. However, there are many areas outside of atmospheric and oce-
anic  sciences  that  need  to  be  addressed,  particularly  in  the  social,  behavioral,  and
economic sciences. Other areas of concern raised in the National Science Board’s re-
port include: (1) Impacts—interaction of hurricanes with engineered structures, eco-
nomic  and  social  impacts  of  hurricanes  and  mitigation  measures,  and  interactions
of  hurricanes  with  natural  ecosystems;  (2)  Preparedness  and  Response  Measures—
assessing  and  improving  the  reliance  on  the  built  environment,  disaster  response
and  recovery,  human  behavior  and  risk  planning,  and  evacuation  planning;  (3)
Cross-cutting  Activities—computational  capability,  and  training  and  education  pro-
grams related to hurricane impacts.

Questions submitted by Chairman Brian Baird
Q1. As  you  and  many  of  the  witnesses  stated  in  their  testimony,  social  science  re-
search  plays  a  crucial  role  in  better  understanding  and  improving  hurricane
preparedness and response.

Q1a. What  areas  of  social  and  behavioral  science  research  do  you  consider  to  be

highest priority areas?

A1a. High  priority  research  areas  of  social  and  behavioral  science  identified  by  the
Board  include:  economic  and  social  impact  of  hurricanes  and  mitigation  measures,
disaster  response  and  recovery,  human  behavior  and  risk  planning,  and  evacuation
planning.
Q1b. How are the results of such research being translated into operational practice?
A1b. As  a  most  telling  example,  following  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita,  NSF  sup-
ported  more  than  100  grants.  Results  from  some  of  these  studies  have  provided
emergency  planners,  responders,  and  others  with  key  findings  ranging  from  how
disasters  inflict  physical  damage  to  the  impact  of  social  factors  on  evacuation  and
long-term emotional effects.
Q1c. Have  you  encountered,  or  are  you  aware  of  any  impediments  to  applying  the
findings from social and behavioral sciences to disaster planning, recovery and
response  activities?  If  so,  do  you  have  any  suggestions  as  to  how  these  impedi-
ments could be addressed?

A1c. The Hurricane Initiative itself, and, most importantly, the Hurricane Test Bed,
could  provide  a  framework  for  collaboration  among  traditionally  disparate  dis-
ciplines.  The  Board  notes  that  communities  often  are  overwhelmed  with  sometimes
conflicting information regarding risk planning and procedures for action. Addition-
ally,  training  and  outreach  activities,  involving  policy-  and  decision-makers,  are
needed  to  ensure  that  research  efforts  are  appropriately  applied,  thus  meeting  the
societal  demand  for  protection  of  life  and  property  and  responsible  management  of
resources.  Finally,  the  social  impacts  of  human-induced  changes  to  coastal  and  off-
shore  vulnerability—ranging  from  land  use  development  and  practices  that  dras-
tically modify the fate of precipitation runoff to social demographics of communities
and their mobility—must be better understood and effectively incorporated into soci-
etal decision-making.
Q2. In  his  testimony  Dr.  Prevatt  stated  that  increased  support  for  research  on
strengthening  the  existing  built  infrastructure  and  developing  cost  effective  ret-
rofit and mitigation measures would be the most effective way to reduce damage
and economic losses from hurricanes. Would you comment on what priority you
would  assign  to  such  research  and  development  efforts  within  the  context  of  a
national hurricane research program?

A2. The Board, in its recent report, has assigned a high priority to research on im-
proving the resilience of the built environment. Resiliency of physical and social in-
frastructure  is  enormously  important  for  successful  disaster  response  and  recovery
operations.  The  establishment  and  sustainability  of  lifelines  to  victims  remains  one
of the greatest challenges following the failure of transportation, power, and commu-
nication infrastructures. Research is needed to provide such lifelines, as well as de-
sign  infrastructures  that  gracefully  degrade,  rather  than  fail  indiscriminately,  dur-
ing extreme conditions. A requirement exists for a national engineering assessment
of  coastal  infrastructure  and  efficacy  of  current  design  practice—including  levees,
sea  walls,  drainage  systems,  bridges,  water/sewage,  power,  and  communications—
to  ascertain  the  associated  level  of  vulnerability  to  hurricanes.  Studies  are  needed
to identify and prioritize the most cost-effective improvements and to develop a na-
tional  loss  reduction  strategy  that  addresses  inevitable  degradation  of  built  infra-
structure.  Careful  attention  also  should  be  paid  in  infrastructure  research  to  exist-
ing building codes and the extent to which recent damage has been a result of non-
compliance.  Research  also  is  needed  to  understand  coastal  erosion  and  resilience,
particularly in relationship to the built environment.
Q3. You  note  in  your  testimony  the  importance  of  a  multi-disciplinary  approach  to
hurricane  research  and  point  out  that  current  research  tends  to  be  stovepiped.
Has  the  National  Science  Board  taken  any  action  since  the  release  of  its  hurri-
cane  report  to  address  this  problem  within  NSF’s  hurricane  research  activities?
Overall,  what  has  been  the  response  of  NSF  thus  far  to  the  recommendations
of the NSB report?

A3. In  recent  years  NSF  has  placed  a  high  priority  on  research  related  to  hurri-
canes. In FY 2007, NSF awarded approximately $12,400,000 to projects dealing with
the  geophysical,  social,  and  engineering  aspects  of  hurricane  processes  and  the  re-
sultant  impacts  on  society  and  the  environment.  This  research  has  included  the
study  of  the  physical  genesis  and  life  cycles  of  hurricanes,  the  development  of  new
simulation and forecast models of hurricane processes, the effect of land-falling hur-
ricanes  on  ecosystems  and  the  natural  environment,  the  impacts  on  social  systems
in  hurricane  impacted  areas,  the  engineering  and  structural  aspects  of  damage  re-
sistant  practices  in  areas  prone  to  hurricane  exposure,  and  damage  assessment  of
facilities and infrastructure in hurricane impacted areas.

Question submitted by Representative Vernon J. Ehlers
Q1. How could the hurricane initiative help encourage development and adoption of

necessary building codes?

A1. The Board notes in its report that engineered structures are vulnerable to dam-
age from wind, precipitation, and storm surge, though the impacts are not well un-
derstood,  particularly  at  the  scale  of  individual  structures.  Research  therefore  is
needed  to  better  understand  fluid-structure  interactions  at  fine  spatial  scales,  with
the  coupling  of  atmospheric  and  land-surface/built  infrastructure  models  being  es-
sential for guiding the creation of improved building designs and construction codes
in  particularly  vulnerable  locations.  Developing  a  better  understanding  of  how  the
land-atmosphere  interface  impacts  hurricane  morphology  is  also  needed.  Oper-
ational  risk  prediction  models,  some  of  which  are  highly  parameterized,  should  be
updated  to  accommodate  the  detailed  characterization  of  four-dimensional  atmos-
pheric structures that are possible with today’s advanced forecast models.

Questions submitted by Representative Mario Diaz-Balart
Q1. Even with better interagency coordination, how do you avoid the stovepipe situa-
tion you discuss that is created by the boundaries of the traditional disciplines?
A1. The Hurricane Initiative provides a framework, and the potential outcomes pro-
vide  an  incentive,  for  collaboration  among  traditionally  disparate  disciplines.  In  FY
2008  NSF  and  NOAA  issued  a  joint  announcement  calling  for  proposals  to  advance
fundamental  understanding  of  the  communication  of  hurricane  outlooks,  forecasts,
watches,  and  warnings  both  to  decision-makers  (i.e.,  emergency  managers,  elected
officials) and to the general public.

The  Board  encourages  interdisciplinary  research,  and  NSF  is  experienced  at  sup-
porting  research  that  crosses  disciplinary  boundaries.  The  Hurricane  Research
Testbed  itself  is  designed  specifically  to  bring  multiple  disciplines  together.  The
Board’s  Hurricane  Task  Force  found  in  our  roundtable  discussions  with  the  science
and  engineering  community  that  researchers  from  multiple  disciplines  are  eager  to

89

work with one another. Workshops and symposia can help bring different groups to-
gether, and, accordingly, NSF regularly supports both.
Q2. How  are  we  not  using  existing  hurricane  research  knowledge  effectively,  as  you
say the NSB study finds? You state that current research is of high quality, but
it is not adequate. Is this purely a funding issue or is there some major research
hurdle standing in the way?

A2. Despite advances made during the past decade in meteorological understanding
and  prediction,  we  still  know  relatively  little  about  the  most  important  aspects  of
hurricanes  from  an  integrative  perspective,  including  their  internal  dynamics  and
interactions  with  the  larger-scale  atmosphere  and  ocean;  methods  for  quantifying
and  conveying  uncertainty  and  mitigating  hurricane  impacts;  associated  short-  and
long-term  consequences  on  the  natural  and  built  environment;  and  the  manner  in
which society responds before, during and after landfall. Billions of tax dollars have
been  provided  for  rescue,  recovery,  and  rebuilding  after  hurricanes  strike.  Also  im-
portant  is  investment  in  the  creation  of  new  knowledge,  and  more  effective  applica-
tion  of  existing  knowledge  to  reduce  those  enormous  public  outlays,  loss  of  life,  and
the associated societal disruption caused by hurricanes. Recognizing the many vital
challenges  associated  with  hurricanes  in  the  broader  context  of  natural  disasters,
the  National  Science  Board  has  engaged  the  Nation’s  experts  in  science  and  engi-
neering  from  government,  academia,  and  industry  in  an  intensive  study  to  identify
priorities in fundamental research and complementary applied or mission-driven re-
search, which can improve our Nation’s ability to become more resilient to hurricane
impacts. The result is ‘‘an agenda for action—a National Hurricane Research Initia-
tive—that  will  provide  urgently  needed  hurricane  science  and  engineering  research
and  education  that  engages  relevant  agencies  across  the  Federal  Government;  in-
volves  industry,  academia,  and  other  levels  of  government;  establishes  highly  fo-
cused priorities; strengthens disciplinary research; creates multi-disciplinary frame-
works  for  studying  the  hurricane  in  an  integrative  fashion;  and  stimulates  the  effi-
cient transfer of research outcomes to operational practice.’’ 1
Q3. Are  there  currently  any  interagency  collaborative  efforts  between  NSF,  NOAA
and  any  other  agencies  on  hurricane  research?  If  so,  please  explain  the  nature
of  these  collaborations.  How  well  do  NSF  and  NOAA  work  together  in  this  re-
gard?

A3. Yes.  The  Federal  Coordinator  for  Meteorological  Services  and  Supporting  Re-
search  (OFCM)  coordinates  Federal  Hurricane  Operations  and  Research  efforts
across  the  responsible  federal  agencies.  Additionally,  federal  agencies,  including
NOAA, NSF, NASA, and the Navy (including Office of Naval Research) are working
to develop a National Hurricane Research Alliance. This Alliance will leverage exist-
ing federal hurricane coordination efforts, including those from the Office of the Fed-
eral Coordinator Meteorological Services and Supporting Research, to manage over-
all  roles  and  responsibilities  (including  those  of  the  broader  academic  community
funded  by  NSF,  NOAA,  and  others).  Through  this  Alliance,  NOAA  and  NSF  will
work  with  the  other  entities  to  maximize  the  effective  use  of  considerable  non-fed-
eral assets in conducting hurricane research.

Many  of  the  hurricane  research  efforts  conducted  to  date  have  had  narrow  foci
and  limited  coordination  across  disciplines.  This  makes  it  difficult  to  engage  the
more challenging questions, the answers to which are not obtainable with short-du-
ration studies. The bottom line is that many of the disciplines for whom hurricanes
are  an  important  research  challenge  (e.g.,  physical  science,  engineering,  social
science,  behavioral  science,  and  economics)  do  not  regularly  interact,  resulting  in  a
myopic view that limits the effectiveness by which problems are formulated and re-
search outcomes can be translated into operational practice. NSF needs to continue
to  support  work  and  communication  across  disciplinary  boundaries  through  work-
shops and by supporting interdisciplinary research approaches.

NSF  currently  supports  merit-reviewed,  highly  interdisciplinary  research  and  co-
ordinates activities with other relevant agencies, including the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  and  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Ad-
ministration (NASA). NSF is discussing with other agencies their interests and how
coordination  can  be  improved,  taking  into  account  the  priorities  related  to  hurri-
canes  under  development  by  the  Disaster  Reduction  Subcommittee  of  the  National
Science  and  Technology  Council’s  Committee  on  Environment  and  Natural  Re-
sources Research.

NSF  and  NOAA,  while  having  different  agency  missions,  do  serve  to  accomplish
a common goal related to physical hurricane research—increasing forecast accuracy
in  order  to  protect  life  and  property.  To  that  end,  NSF  and  NOAA  have  recently
collaborated  to  conduct  a  major  field  campaign  studying  internal  hurricane  dynam-
ics.  This  project,  called  the  Hurricane  Rainband  and  Intensity  Change  Experiment
(RAINEX), took place in 2005. NSF and NOAA sponsored aircraft were able to sam-
ple hurricanes, including Katrina and Rita, in unprecedented detail by using coordi-
nated  flights.  The  results  from  this  work  will  likely  have  an  impact  on  under-
standing rapid intensification periods in hurricanes, which are one of the most cru-
cial aspects of forecasting.

An  interagency  and  international  project  that  will  be  taking  place  in  August  and
September  2008  is  the  THORPEX  (The  Observing  Research  and  Predictability  Ex-
periment) Pacific Asian Regional Campaign (T–PARC). This NSF/DOD/international
collaborative effort will follow tropical systems from their formation, through matu-
rity, to their eventual recurvature and downstream effects.

Another  main  unresolved  question  about  tropical  systems  is  why  only  a  small
number of tropical waves and disturbances actually organize and intensify into trop-
ical  storms  and  hurricanes.  To  further  research  this  topic,  NSF,  NOAA,  DOD,  and
NASA are discussing a field experiment in the Atlantic Ocean that will study these
pre-storm  disturbances.  While  any  one  of  the  agencies  could  approach  this  topic  on
their  own,  the  collaboration  between  them  greatly  increases  the  likelihood  that  the
data  collected  will  be  sufficient  to  make  large  steps  forward  in  our  understanding
of the topic.

In  addition  to  these  observational  campaigns,  NSF  and  NOAA  researchers  have
also  collaborated  on  the  next  generation  numerical  weather  forecasting  models  for
hurricane  research.  Called  the  HWRF,  or  Hurricane  Weather  Research  and  Fore-
casting model, this new model includes significantly increased amounts of data and
is  run  at  a  much  finer  scale  than  previous  operational  models.  Finally,  NSF  and
NOAA  recently  issued  a  joint  announcement  for  funding  proposals  on  Commu-
nicating Hurricane Information (CHI).
Q4. Assuming  a  budget  that  remains  flat,  where  would  you  suggest  the  NSF  and
NOAA cut funding in order to fund their share of the $285 million per year au-
thorized  in  the  H.R.  2407  for  this  research?  And  where  would  you  suggest  they
make  cuts  in  order  to  fund  the  $20  million  per  year  for  the  database  require-
ments?

A4. The Board encourages NSF and NOAA to consider this recommendation in set-
ting  priorities  for  future  budgets.  NSF  establishes  its  budget  priorities  through  a
process  that  integrates  broad-based  input  provided  by  the  science  and  engineering
community  with  the  overall  strategic  direction  set  by  the  Foundation’s  leadership
through  interactions  with  the  Board,  OMB,  OSTP,  Congress,  and  NOAA  and  other
R&D agencies and institutions.
Q5. The  authorizations  set  forth  in  this  bill  are  total  amounts.  So,  how  should  the
money be divided between NSF and NOAA to carry out the initiative? Are other
‘‘coordinating’’  federal  agencies  to  receive  part  of  the  funding  as  well?  Should
they?

A5. In  its  study,  the  Board  found  investments  in  science  and  engineering  research
related  to  hurricanes  and  earthquakes  were  funded  by  a  range  of  federal  agencies
(see attachment, Appendix A of the Board’s report). The Board proposed new invest-
ments in essential areas of science and engineering research for the National Hurri-
cane Research Initiative without reference to federal department or agency funding
source.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Shuyi  S.  Chen,  Professor  of  Meteorology  and  Physical  Oceanography,

Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Miami

Questions submitted by Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. There are four major reports on improving hurricane research and forecast men-
tioned  in  your  testimony.  Is  there  anything  different  in  these  other  reports  from
the  National  Science  Board  report?  Are  there  things  in  these  other  reports  that
need to be addressed in H.R. 2407?

A1. They all strike the same main point: hurricane research must be a national pri-
ority.  The  reports  are  similar,  but  have  slightly  different  emphases  given  the  pri-
mary  missions  of  each  agency  and  organization.  They  all  agree  that  improvement
in  forecasting  requires  better  understanding  and  modeling  of  rapid  intensity
changes  and  storm  genesis  (formation).  Consistent  with  their  mission,  NOAA
HIRWG  report  placed  the  prediction  of  rapid  intensity  change  as  the  highest  pri-
ority, which is mostly based on the fact that NOAA’s primary responsibility is fore-
casting,  whereas  the  National  Science  Board  report  put  emphases  on  integrating
physical  science  and  engineering  as  well  as  social  science  to  study  hurricane  fore-
casting and response in its entirety. The AGU report focuses on science-based strat-
egy in rebuilding the U.S. Gulf coast after the 2005 hurricane disasters. The OFCM
report is mainly concerned with the coordination of operational forecasting, warning,
and  emergency  response.  H.R.  2407  covers  the  whole  range  of  hurricane  research.
Q2. What are the current major gaps in research to better forecast hurricanes? Does
the proposed legislation H.R. 2407 and NOAA’s Hurricane Forecasting Improve-
ment Plan address these needs?

A2. The  major  gaps  in  research  to  better  forecast  hurricanes  are:  1)  The  funda-
mental  understanding  of  the  predictability  of  hurricanes  and  factors  limiting  the
current prediction of hurricane genesis and rapid intensity change; and 2) The effec-
tive transfer of knowledge and technology from the research to operations. The NSF-
supported basic research at academic institutions is best suited to fill the first gap.
The  NOAA  Hurricane  Forecasting  Improvement  Plan  mainly  addresses  the  second.

Questions submitted by Chairman Brian Baird
Q1. As  you  and  many  of  the  witnesses  stated  in  their  testimony,  social  science  re-
search  plays  crucial  role  in  better  understanding  and  improving  hurricane  pre-
paredness  and  response.  What  areas  of  social  and  behavioral  science  research
do  you  consider  to  be  highest  priority  areas?  How  are  the  results  of  such  re-
search  being  translated  into  operational  practice?  Have  you  encountered,  or  are
you  aware  of  any  impediments  to  applying  the  findings  from  social  and  behav-
ioral sciences to disaster planning, recovery and response activities? If so, do you
have any suggestions as to how these impediments could be addressed?

A1. Although  I  am  not  a  social  scientist,  I  came  to  recognize  the  importance  of  so-
cial  science  in  hurricane  research  through  close  communication  with  my  social  sci-
entist colleagues who are experts on human behavior and response to natural disas-
ters and through my own experience in several recent land-falling hurricane events.
Better understanding of three areas in social science is particularly important and
of  high  priority:  1)  how  a  diverse,  complex  user  population  gathers  and  interprets
information (through media, Internet, or word-of-mouth) when responding to an ap-
proaching  hurricane  threat,  2)  how  experiences  in  the  past,  including  both  real
events and false alarms, affect human reaction to forecasts of disastrous events, and
3)  how  to  enhance  the  willingness  of  people  to  invest  in  protective  measures  that
would  lower  the  costs  of  low-probability,  high-consequence  hazards  like  hurricane
hits.

The  panic  evacuation  in  Texas  during  Hurricane  Rita  in  September  2005  and
water and gas shortage in South Florida after Hurricane Wilma in October 2005 are
vivid  examples  of  failure  to  anticipate  human  behavioral  responses  to  hurricane
forecasts  under  different  situations,  which  led  to  over-  and  under-preparedness.
These were not only consequences of over-warning of Rita in Texas and many false
alarms prior to Wilma in South Florida but also a lack of understanding of the psy-
chology of human reactions to disasters.

There  has  been  little  implementation  of  research  to  operational  practice,  because
social  science  to  this  point  has  only  been  able  to  offer  broad  principles  and
hypotheses  rather  than  concrete  guidance.  The  combination  of  the  lack  of  invest-

93

ment in basic research in this area and the rarity of these high-impact events make
it a particularly difficult problem (Meyer 20061 ).

The  impediments  are  both  the  lack  of  basic  research  on  implementable  solutions
and  the  lack  of  training  of  emergency  managers  and  public  officials  on  the  com-
plexity  of  hurricane  impacts  on  human  psychology  and  organizational  behavior.  As
I mentioned in my testimony, we need to have an integrated hurricane forecast and
response system that offers accurate hurricane forecast, a seamless information flow
from the forecast to risk assessment, emergency response and ultimately mitigation
of  hurricane  damage.  Improved  forecasts  will  reduce  false  alarms  and  uncertainty
in  physical  impacts  of  hurricanes  and,  therefore  reduce  over-  or  under-warnings.
Successful implementation of such a system requires education of a new generation
of physical and social scientists, technicians, forecasters, government managers, and
a guaranteed smooth transition from research to operations.
Q2. In  his  testimony  Dr.  Prevatt  stated  that  increased  support  for  research  on
strengthening  the  existing  built  infrastructure  and  developing  cost  effective  ret-
rofit and mitigation measures would be the most effective way to reduce damage
and economic losses from hurricanes. Would you comment on what priority you
would  assign  to  such  research  and  development  efforts  within  the  context  of  a
national hurricane research program?

A2. Research on strengthening the existing built infrastructure is an important part
of  the  overall  effort  to  reduce  physical  damages  and  economic  losses  from  hurri-
canes.  Meanwhile,  we  must  realize  that  hurricane  damage  and  economic  losses  are
not limited to built infrastructures, but extend to the entire social and economic in-
frastructure  that  include  information  flow,  communications,  energy  and  food  sup-
plies,  and  emergency  management.  The  cost  for  unnecessary  evacuation  from  over-
warning, for example, accounts for a major part of economic losses. Citizens who are
better  prepared  by  education  and  proper  communication  could  reduce  their  losses.
It  is  a  highly  complex  problem  that  is  far  beyond  built  infrastructures  alone.  We
need  an  integrated  forecast,  communication,  and  education  system  to  improve  re-
sponse  to  hurricanes  and  mitigation  to  reduce  hurricane  damages  and  economic
losses.

Although  retrofitting  existing  built  structures  could  be  effective  in  reducing  dam-
age,  it  is  not  clear  if  the  current  data  used  in  establishing  the  standards  for
‘‘strengthening’’ the existing built structures is adequate. I would give it a high pri-
ority  second  to  the  research  on  understanding  the  impact  of  landfalling  hurricanes
in  terms  of  extreme  winds  and  flooding  potential  at  a  given  area  so  we  can  deter-
mine  the  standards  by  which  the  existing  built  structures  must  be  strengthened.  A
third priority worth mentioning, and one that would advance understanding of both
mitigation and evacuation decisions, is the social science of how complex, multi-lay-
ered government and private organizations respond to hurricane risk.
Q3. How  much  of  the  potential  improvement  possible  in  the  prediction  of  hurricane
intensity  will  come  from  the  availability  of  increasingly  more  powerful  com-
puters, which in turn will permit increasingly smaller computational grid spac-
ing  in  the  simulations  you  do?  Will  advances  in  computer  power,  which  have
been steady and continuous, solve the hurricane intensity prediction problem?

A3. Increased  computer  power  is  essential  to  improving  hurricane  intensity  pre-
diction,  but  must  be  accompanied  by  more  advanced  understanding  and  knowledge
of  how  to  best  formulate  and  design  numerical  prediction  models  representing  the
physical  reality  of  hurricanes.  Reduced  grid  spacing  allows  us  to  resolve  fine-scale
features in hurricanes, e.g., the eye and eyewall, which are critical for hurricane in-
tensity. However, it also presents new challenges because our current knowledge of
how  various  physical  processes  work  in  extreme  wind  conditions,  for  example,  the
energy  transfer  at  the  air-sea  interface  with  breaking  waves,  is  still  very  limited.
Furthermore, a lack of observations of the fine-scale structure in hurricanes, which
hinders  our  ability  to  initialize  the  high-resolution  models  and  validate  model  pre-
dictions,  is  another  major  challenge.  Improvement  in  numerical  models,  high  per-
formance computers, innovative observations and data assimilation of the hurricane
structure  will  have  to  be  achieved  in  concert  to  guarantee  substantive  progress  in
predicting  hurricane  intensity  change.  Basic  research  and  human  resources  are
therefore more critical. We must educate and train the next generation of scientists,
engineers,  and  forecasters  at  both  undergraduate  and  graduate  levels  to  ensure  in-

creased  computer  power  will  indeed  yield  societal  benefit  in  prediction  of  hurricane
intensity.

Questions submitted by Representative Mario Diaz-Balart
Q1. How much of the University of Miami’s hurricane research is funded by NOAA?
NSF?  Are  any  of  the  grants  jointly  funded  or  is  there  other  joint  collaboration
between the university and these federal agencies?

A1. The  majority  of  the  hurricane  research  funding  at  the  University  of  Miami  is
from  the  NSF,  ONR,  and  NASA.  NOAA  funds  some  research-to-operation  projects,
but  relatively  little  basic  research  at  universities  in  general.  From  my  own  experi-
ence  of  working  on  research  related  to  better  understanding  and  improving  hurri-
cane  intensity  forecasts  at  the  University  of  Miami  over  the  last  10  years,  I  have
never received a direct research grant from NOAA.
Q2. As  a  representative  of  the  Rosenstiel  School,  how  would  you  characterize  the
level  of  cooperation  between  the  different  federal  agencies  currently  engaged  in
hurricane research?

A2. The cooperation among federal agencies has been good at the program level. For
example,  NOAA  has  supported  the  hurricane  research  programs  led  by  other  agen-
cies though its airborne observational capability, as in the Hurricane Rainband and
Intensity  Change  Experiment  (RAINEX)  funded  by  NSF,  the  Coupled  Boundary
Layer  Air-Sea  Transfer  (CBLAST)–Hurricane  funded  by  ONR,  and  the  Tropical
Cloud System Processes (TCSP) funded by NASA.
Q2a. Do  the  proposed  interagency  and  multi-disciplinary  approaches  in  H.R.  2407

address all of your concerns?

A2a. I believe that H.R. 2407 will make the cooperation stronger by providing a co-
herent and integrated approach to hurricane research from the start.
Q2b. Do  you  have  specific  suggestions  sitting  on  your  side  of  the  table  that  would
improve your institution’s interaction with the ‘‘interagency research efforts’’ as
they currently exist?

A2b. Cooperation  between  agencies  should  not  be  limited  to  NSF  and  NOAA,  but
also others like ONR and NASA that are supporting hurricane research, as well as
FEMA  that  can  insure  the  improved  hurricane  forecast  is  effectively  benefiting  the
emergency response and recovery efforts.
Q3. You mention the capabilities of European forecast models. How much collabora-
tion  is  there  between  your  institution  and  other  countries?  How  much  inter-
national  cooperation  do  you  see  happening  on  the  federal  level  on  this  type  of
research?  Would  you  advocate  for  greater  interactions  with  other  country’s  re-
search programs?

A3. Data  sharing  has  certainly  benefited  all  countries.  This  is  particularly  evident
in  both  space-  and  Earth-based  observing  systems.  I  am  absolutely  supportive  for
more  of  the  interactions  among  scientists  from  all  countries.  The  collaboration  has
to be based on science. International scientific collaboration and coordination under
federal  support  should  be  initiated  by  scientists.  One  area  of  immediate  reward  is
the  improvement  in  global  model  forecasts  from  other  countries,  e.g.,  the  European
Center,  can  affect  the  ensemble  hurricane  track  forecasts.  The  real  time  ensemble
forecasts from the European Center are not publicly available outside the European
Union; users in the U.S. need to purchase these forecasts. Hence there are very few
groups  in  the  U.S.  that  are  using  the  forecasts  from  the  European  Center  model,
which  is  unfortunate  since  these  are  arguably  some  of  the  best  forecasts  in  the
world.
Q4. The  authorizations  set  forth  in  this  bill  are  total  amounts.  So,  how  should  the
money be divided between NSF and NOAA to carry out the initiative? Are other
‘‘coordinating’’  federal  agencies  to  receive  part  of  the  funding  as  well?  Should
they?

A4. NSF  and  NOAA  should  be  co-lead  agencies  to  address  the  hurricane  problem
from  both  basic  research  and  transfer  of  research  outcomes  to  operational  practice.
The  funding  should  be  divided  50/50  between  the  two  agencies.  The  role  of  NSF
should be to support the fundamental research (where a greater investment is need-
ed),  and  the  role  of  NOAA  should  be  to  support  the  transfer  of  research  to  oper-
ations.  Other  agencies  can  also  contribute  and  play  important  roles  based  on  their

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by David O. Prevatt, Assistant Professor, Department of Civil and Coastal

Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville

Questions submitted by Chairman Brian Baird
Q1. As  you  and  many  of  the  witnesses  stated  in  their  testimony,  social  science  re-
search  plays  a  crucial  role  in  better  understanding  and  improving  hurricane
preparedness and response. What areas of social and behavioral science research
do you consider to be highest priority areas?

A1. Social  Science  research  plays  a  key  role  in  getting  homeowners  to  understand
the technological options available and the financial impact of improving the hurri-
cane resistance of their new or existing homes. I would put the need to educate the
public on these options at the top of the list of needed research. We need to develop
a  much  better  understanding  of  the  incentive  mechanisms  that  stir  homeowners  to
action.  What  is  also  needed  is  the  social  mechanisms  to  make  homeowners  aware
of the risks imposed by such high impact, low frequency events like hurricanes. The
risks  must  be  conveyed  not  only  from  the  individual  homeowner’s  perspective  but
also  as  aggregated  to  the  community  risks—it  is  the  price  to  pay  for  living  in  a  re-
gion threatened by a known natural hazard.

The  basis  for  this  position  is  that  despite  dozens  of  new  technologies  that  have
been  tested  and  shown  to  significantly  improve  the  hurricane  resistance  of  homes,
these  are  not  being  readily  implemented.  Unfortunately,  we  are  faced  with  edu-
cating the public about how homes are constructed and how/why buildings react the
way  they  do  to  the  high  wind  loads  associated  with  a  hurricane  event.  This  is  not
necessarily  an  engineering  lecture;  rather,  it  is  best  presented  as  a  logical  or  intu-
itive discussion of the performance of a building under high wind conditions.

The frequency of such discussion need to be addressed, and emphasis needs to be
placed on educating the next generation of homeowners—our children who are more
likely  to  embrace  the  technologies  if  they  were  exposed  to  knowledge  of  the  risk
from  their  childhood.  (e.g.,  seat  belt  wearing  in  vehicles  is  almost  100  percent  now,
compared  to  the  relatively  small  percentages  of  wearers  when  the  legislation  was
originally  introduced).  People  seem  to  accept  the  need  to  carry  fire  insurance,  and
some will even purchase fire extinguishers for their home. Few seem to understand
their probability of sustaining damage from a flood or windstorm is, in many cases,
greater  than  their  risk  of  having  a  fire.  Clearly,  there’s  been  some  success  in  com-
municating  fire  risk  and  spurring  individuals’  actions  that  needs  to  be  translated
to natural hazards, like hurricanes, floods, and other windstorms.

Social science research is also needed to develop the most effective communication
messages  that  persuade  the  majority  of  people  to  evacuate  in  advance  of  a  hurri-
cane.  Conversely,  social  science  research  may  be  necessary  to  convince  others  not
to  evacuate  when  they  are  in  no  danger  but  their  presence  on  the  highways  may
add  additional  risks  to  themselves.  The  publicity  encouraging  evacuation  should  be
aimed  at  those  least  likely  to  evacuate  and  in  most  danger—minorities,  lower  in-
come, people without cars, for example—and designed by advertisers who know how
to  reach  those  groups.  There  is  research  underway  about  what  to  do  about  pets.  It
should be continued.

More  social  science  research  is  needed  to  reduce  post-hurricane  psychological  im-
pacts. The use of psychological debriefing has been called into question by research
findings  showing  that  it  may  not  change  outcomes  or  may  even  worsen  outcomes
for  some.  However,  there  is  still  a  need  for  further  research  on  what  are  the  most
effective  post-disaster  interventions  that  would  help  mitigate  the  development  of
later problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and other mental
health problems.
Q2. How  are  the  results  of  such  research  being  translated  into  operational  practice?
A2. Several states have programs in existence. Efforts are underway to educate and
train design professionals architects and engineers and builders in hurricane-resist-
ant  construction.  This  key  group  works  with  homeowners  during  renovations  and
repairs  and  they  can  communicate  the  options  and  benefits  of  hurricane-resistant
construction.  FEMA  identified  and  targeted  this  group  for  outreach  and  training
over  the  last  10  years,  providing  its  ‘‘Coastal  Construction  Manual’’  (FEMA  55)
courses and other guidance materials.

However, very little training effort is aimed at new students who can be most in-
fluenced by this knowledge. The limited research support for faculty in our tertiary
academic institutions has stifled research and removed incentives for faculty to pur-

sue  these  areas  and  so  the  education  is  not  supported.  In  Florida,  some  tools  that
are available to assist in this process are:

• The computer-based Home Structure Rating System (HSRS) that was de-
veloped  by  the  University  of  Florida  for  the  Florida  Department  of  Financial
Services can provide an evaluation of the likelihood of a home in a given loca-
tion being in the path of a hurricane. The HSRS analyzes the structural char-
acteristics  of  the  existing  building,  compares  the  structure  to  the  expected
wind  loads,  and  provides  the  homeowner  with  a  prioritized  list  of  home  im-
provements  to  be  considered  along  with  the  cost  range  for  the  improvements
and  the  reduction  in  wind  damage  insurance  premium  that  can  be  expected.
• Four regional Windstorm Damage Mitigation Training and Demonstra-
tion  Centers  (known  as  ‘‘Hurricane  Houses’’)  designed  and  constructed
by the University of Florida located in coastal areas across Florida. The Cen-
ters  are  located  in  Escambia,  St.  Johns,  St.  Lucie,  and  Broward  Counties.
These  Centers  are  staffed  by  Florida  Cooperative  Extension  Service  faculty
and form the statewide infrastructure that can reach the public with the nec-
essary  information  and  education  programs.  (Funding  for  the  two  remaining
Centers  to  be  located  on  Florida’s  Gulf  Coast  thus  completing  statewide  cov-
erage has not yet been provided.)

• The  My  Safe  Florida  Home  Program  operated  by  the  Florida  Depart-
ment  of  Financial  Services  has  provided  free  home  inspections  for  thou-
sands of homeowners in Florida—primarily in the coastal areas. These inspec-
tions are performed by certified inspectors that have been trained by the Flor-
ida  Cooperative  Extension  Service  faculty  using  the  training-room  facilities
available  at  the  Hurricane  Houses.  The  data  captured  by  the  inspections  re-
sults  in  a  list  of  wind-resistant  home  improvements  that  the  owner  should
consider,  estimates  of  the  cost  of  the  improvements,  and  estimates  of  the  re-
duction in wind insurance premium that may be expected.

Q3. Have  you  encountered,  or  are  you  aware  of  any  impediments  to  applying  the
findings  from  social  and  behavioral  sciences  to  disaster  planning,  recovery  and
response  activities?  If  so,  do  you  have  any  suggestions  as  to  how  these  impedi-
ments could be addressed?

A3. Incentive Mechanisms

The  Hurricane  Houses  in  Florida  are  visited  by  thousands  of  people  each  year.
We know these people come to the Centers for a variety of reasons and carry away
with  them  added  knowledge  about  the  effect  of  wind  on  buildings  and  the  alter-
natives  available  for  retrofitting  their  homes  to  prevent  or  minimize  wind  damage.
However,  due  to  lack  of  adequate  resources,  the  Centers  are  unable  to  conduct  fol-
low-up surveys or face-to-face interviews with the visitors about what did or did not
motivate them to take action to harden their homes against wind damage. We know
by  the  interest  in  the  Hurricane  Houses  that  the  public  wants  the  information;  we
do not currently know what has worked and what didn’t work to stimulate the visi-
tors to invest in wind resistant technology for their home.

Limited Technology Transfer Support

• The  fact  that  there  are  currently  only  four  out  of  six  planned  Hurricane
Houses  and  that  there  is  no  central  statewide  outreach  coordination  function
are  testimony  to  the  low  priority  that  Florida  has  assigned  to  the  social
science  research  that  will  help  us  focus  our  message  to  the  public  about  re-
ducing potential property losses from Hurricane events.
• The  situation  in  other  states  is  in  far  worse  shape  than  Florida.  I  am  aware
of  only  one  hurricane  demonstration  building  in  Charleston,  SC,  run  by  the
SC Sea Grant Consortium and which is no longer has a permanent staff. An-
other  demonstration  building  in  Baton  Rouge  Louisiana  is  also  in  operation
run by faculty of the Louisiana State University.

Q4. In  your  testimony,  you  raise  the  importance  of  applying  existing  knowledge  we
have  to  design  and  retrofit  structures  to  resist  hurricane  damage.  What  kind  of
research is being done to determine the most cost effective ways to retrofit?

A4. The academic engineering community is undertaking research on how to under-
stand  the  physical  effects  of  hurricane  winds,  rain  and  storm  surge  and  to  design
structures  and  materials  to  be  more  wind  and  flood  resistant.  But  there  is  little
funding to support efforts to translate these results into codes and the construction/
retrofit market. A key role for the Federal Government in this arena is to help bet-

ter  identify  and  coordinate  basic  research,  and  provide  mechanisms  to  get  the  re-
sults translated into action. The hurricane research initiative should focus primarily
on  basic  research,  but  perhaps  translation  of  results  should  not  be  an  emphasis.
That function could be performed by existing programs, such as the National Wind-
storm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP), which Congress established in 2004 for
the  purpose  of  coordinating  windstorm-related  research  and  putting  results  into
practice.  The  agencies  involved  in  NWIRP  have  not  received  direct  funding  for  the
program, but with proper support, it could function well in coordinating research on
retrofit  methods  developed  through  the  hurricane  initiative  and  translating  results
into the broader user community.

Although  progress  is  being  made  on  hurricane-resistant  design,  more  support  is
needed  to  fund  research  to  improve  not  only  building  codes,  but  other  mitigation
techniques  and  best  practices.  Building  codes  are  a  consensus  document  developed
through participation of all parties in the construction industry. However, the build-
ing  code  sets  out  minimum  legal  limits  of  construction.  The  first  challenge  we  face
is that building codes today rely upon research that is over 30 to 40 years old, and
very little new funding has been provided to develop new knowledge or upgrade ex-
isting ones. Second, every significant hurricane shows us that codes are not the only
solution.  Building  a  structure  to  meet  code  will  help  ensure  the  structure  remains
standing in a design-level event; it does not, however, guarantee that no significant
damage  will  occur.  Codes  are  primarily  aimed  minimizing  loss  of  life;  to  minimize
property damage, mitigation techniques that go beyond codes must be used.

So, while there is a need for research to improve codes, there are also other areas
that  must  be  researched  and  developed,  including,  risk-wise  land  use,  comprehen-
sive  planning,  code-plus  techniques,  inspector  training  and  education,  etc.  These
tools are needed alongside better codes to substantially reduce losses.
Q5. Are you aware of any social and behavioral science research being done relative

to the issue of designing and retrofitting homes and other buildings?

A5. I  am  not  familiar  with  this  research  but  would  recommend  that  resources  of
the  National  Hazards  Center  in  Boulder,  CO  be  used  (Kathleen  Tierney)  Also,  Ms.
Leslie  Chapman-Henderson  of  the  Federal  Alliance  for  Safe  Homes—FLASH
would be a useful resource person as well.

Question submitted by Representative Vernon J. Ehlers
Q1. How could the hurricane initiative help encourage development and adoption of

necessary building codes?

A1. Building  codes  are  a  start,  but  there  is  more  to  this  that  should  be  addressed.
As was mentioned in response to Congressman Baird’s last question, building codes
are  a  consensus  on  minimum  legal  limits  of  construction.  Building  a  structure  to
meet  code  will  help  ensure  the  structure  remains  standing  in  a  design-level  event;
it does not, however, guarantee that no significant damage will occur. Codes are pri-
marily aimed minimizing loss of life; to minimize property damage, mitigation tech-
niques that go beyond codes must be used.

The  hurricane  research  initiative  can  support  both  development  of  better  codes
through enhanced funding for basic hurricane research, as well as aid research into
hazard mitigation techniques and mitigation planning. The latter could include sup-
port  of  social  science  researchers  who  examine  community  and  individual  decision-
making with regard to hurricanes and related hazards. The science and engineering
communities  can  develop  a  superior  code,  but  it  will  be  ineffective  if  communities
fail to adopt it and invest their limited resources in implementing and enforcing it.
The proposed hurricane research initiative includes support in this area.

Some examples of other subject areas that the initiative could address are:

• Effective  mitigation  of  homes—Destructive  testing  of  existing  homes  to  com-

penetration.

• Full-scale  testing  of  whole  systems  (both  lab  specimens  and  in-field  real

homes) subjected to controlled hurricane environments.

• Simulating real wind turbulence and rain conditions as measured in the field.

pare as-built resistance vs. mitigated.

• Aging effects—long-term durability and performance issues, performance deg-

radation of older homes and components.

• Emerging vulnerability issues—economic losses to newer homes due to water

To  be  successful,  the  above  research  must  fully  engage  all  stakeholder  groups
(product  manufacturers,  home  builders  associations,  certified  test  labs,  codes  and
standards officials).

Questions submitted by Representative Mario Diaz-Balart
Q1. You  mention  in  your  testimony  that  ‘‘limited  research  and  technology  transfer
support’’  focused  on  strengthening  the  existing  built  infrastructure  are  the  rea-
sons  that  mitigating  damage  and  economic  loss  from  hurricanes  has  been  poor.
Please  expand  on  what  you  mean  by  technology  transfer  support  and  why  this
is a problem.

A1. Without technology transfer of methods to strengthen existing infrastructure we
continue  to  accept  that  the  majority  of  our  structures  will  suffer  severely  in  hurri-
canes.  This  need  not  be  so.  We  need  to  ensure  that  the  public  and  decision-makers
understand that we do not have to suffer the current impacts from wind storms and
associated  water  penetration  problems.  This  could  be  accomplished  through  a  dedi-
cated  research,  training  and  information  providing  program.  For  example,  limited
work  is  currently  going  into  wind  uplift  performance  testing,  which  results  in  new
technologies that are incorporated into the International Code Council’s guidance for
manufacturers  and  others.  Researchers  need  to  conduct  additional  work  on  testing
methods to assist the industry in validating the concepts contained in the guidance.
With  proper  support  from  Congress  and  the  Administration,  the  National  Wind-
storm  Impact  Reduction  Program  (NWIRP)  could  help  improve  government  coordi-
nation of research (including the hurricane research initiative) and subsequent tech-
nology  transfer.  In  other  words,  the  hurricane  research  initiative  could  focus  more
of its resources on fundamental research and research-to-operations (e.g., forecasts),
while  the  NWIRP  could  focus  on  technology  transfer  and  application  of  results  by
Federal,  State,  and  local  governments,  code  and  standard  development  organiza-
tions, design professionals, and other stakeholders.
Q2. How much of the University of Florida’s hurricane research is funded by NOAA?
NSF?  Are  any  of  the  grants  jointly  funded  or  is  there  other  joint  collaboration
between the university and these federal agencies?

A2.

Research  support  to  University  of  Florida  from  NOAA  and  the  NSF  has  totaled
approximately $2.6 million dollars over the 12-year period, 1996 through 2008. This
figure represents 27 percent of the total external research support that the Univer-
sity of Florida received for hurricane-related research over that period. The average
annual  NSF  support  was  $75,000  per  year  and  support  from  the  Department  of
Commerce/NOAA  was  $128,000  per  year.  About  60  percent  of  UF’s  external  funds
to  support  hurricane  research  have  come  from  State  agencies,  such  as  Florida  De-
partment of Transportation (FDOT), the Department of Community Affairs, and the
Department of Insurance.

Such  limited  research  support  is  alarming,  given  that  as  the  flagship  university
in the State of Florida, the University of Florida with its 50,000 student body argu-
ably has been at the forefront of most significant hurricane related research for the

State  of  Florida.  Despite  this,  only  35  researchers  (Principal  Investigator  and  Co-
PIs)  have  received  external  funding  to  pursue  hurricane  research  in  the  past  12
years. Further, the research expenditure is minimal compared to the costs of hurri-
cane damage wrought by most recent storms (Hurricane Andrew -$30 billion, Char-
lie,  Frances,  Ivan,  Jeanne,  Dennis,  Katrina,  Rita  and  Wilma),  it  is  not  surprising
therefore  that  current  trends  show  increasing  annual  economic  losses  from  hurri-
canes,
Q3. Speaking  as  a  representative  of  the  University  of  Florida,  how  would  you  char-
acterize  the  level  of  cooperation  between  the  different  federal  agencies  currently
engaged  in  hurricane  research?  Do  the  proposed  interagency  and  multi-discipli-
nary approaches in H.R. 2407 address all of your concerns? So you have specific
suggestions  sitting  on  your  side  of  the  table  that  would  improve  your  institu-
tion’s interaction with the interagency research efforts as they currently exist?

A3. In some respects, federal agencies do cooperate well on hurricane-related activi-
ties,  but  research  and  loss  reduction  programs  are  areas  where  coordination  could
be  improved.  Agencies  have  varied  existing  authorities  concerning  hurricanes,  and
while some coordination occurs through the National Science and Technology Coun-
cil’s  Subcommittee  on  Disaster  Reduction,  most  agencies  concentrate  on  activities
that  fulfill  their  specific  missions.  This  limits  the  resources  that  can  go  into  funda-
mental research and comprehensive, interagency efforts to reduce hurricane-related
losses.

Programs  dedicated  solely  to  hazard  loss  reduction  research  and  development
(R&D) receive the smallest share of R&D funds from the Federal Government. The
largest fraction goes to basic and applied research programs at the NSF, NOAA and
NASA.  The  second  largest  category  is  operational  support  R&D,  focused  almost  ex-
clusively on weather-related hazards.

The  largest  fraction  of  R&D  spending  supports  work  on  weather  hazards  and
broadly  related  research  on  climatology,  atmospheric  science,  and  oceanography.
The  hurricane  initiative  proposed  in  H.R.2407  proposes  to  continue  this  trend.  The
second  largest  category  of  R&D  funding—a  distant  second—is  research  on  earth-
quakes. While losses from weather-related hazards are estimated to be approximately
twice as large as those from earthquakes, the allocation of R&D funds between these
categories differs by more than a factor of 10 in favor of earthquake research.

Closer  examination  of  the  funding  for  weather-related  hazard  R&D  shows  that
most of the effort is focused on short-term prediction efforts, which have limited loss
reduction  potential  within  the  full  range  of  losses  from  natural  hazards.  Prediction
can  generally  move  individuals  out  of  harm’s  way,  but  R&D  focused  on  long-term
loss reduction strategies could improve the resilience of communities and infrastruc-
ture, protecting lives and property in a far more substantial way.

While H.R. 2407 begins to address the disparity in funding for hurricane research,
the  legislation  needs  to  better  address  coordination  of  efforts.  For  the  hurricane  re-
search initiative to be successful in meeting its goals, there needs to be ongoing com-
munication and coordination among the parties involved. There should be a mecha-
nism  for  federal  agencies  to  coordinate  research  and  operational  activities  con-
cerning  hurricanes,  track  progress  in  meeting  the  initiative’s  goals,  and  ensure  re-
search  results  are  being  disseminated  and  used  to  reduce  hurricane-related  dam-
ages.  Academic  researchers,  State  and  local  officials,  code  groups,  and  other  stake-
holders  should  also  have  a  mechanism  to  review  the  initiative’s  progress,  identify
gaps in current research, and bring forward new issues that must be addressed. One
option  Congress  may  consider  is  to  give  the  hurricane  research  initiative  a  formal
structure  to  accomplish  all  of  this.  The  National  Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction
Program is an excellent model for organizing research and applied efforts across fed-
eral agencies, the academic community, and other non-federal sectors. Alternatively,
there  may  be  other  existing  programs,  such  as  NWIRP,  where  these  coordination
functions  can  be  incorporated,  preserving  maximum  funding  for  research  and  re-
lated activities.
Q4. This  bill  would  require  the  development  of  a  National  Infrastructure  Database.
Considering the national security implications of a single database that contains
the  location  of  every  vulnerable  building,  road,  utility,  etc.,  in  the  country  and
the  attendant  requirements  that  would  be  established  in  order  to  access  it,  how
could  such  a  database  be  developed  that  would  not  compromise  the  safety  and
security of people living in these vulnerable structures?

A4. The  Federal  Government  has  several  existing  programs  aimed  at  inventorying
and  characterizing  the  built  environment.  For  example,  in  developing  its  loss  esti-
mation  software,  HAZUS,  FEMA  compiled  initial  building  inventory  data  for  the
Nation, which is supplemented by more detailed data by State or local users. FEMA

recognized  early  on  the  great  challenge  in  creating  national  data  sets  at  the  detail
necessary  to  estimate  hazard-related  losses  and  develop  meaningful  mitigation  ac-
tions. More recently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been tasked with devel-
oping a national levee database, which will include not only federal levees but struc-
tures  built  by  State  and  local  governments  and  private  interests.  Not  surprisingly,
it  will  take  many  years  (and  millions  of  dollars)  for  this  database  to  be  completed.
Given  the  challenges  inherent  to  developing  a  ‘‘National  Infrastructure  Database,’’
it may be more advantageous to focus on developing a database or centralized clear-
inghouse  of  existing  infrastructure  information  and  ensure  it  is  available  to  the  re-
searchers,  agencies,  and  other  groups  engaged  in  the  hurricane  research  initiative.
Q4a. The authorizations set forth in this bill are total amounts. So, how should the
money be divided between NSF and NOAA to carry out the initiative? Are other
‘‘coordinating’’ federal agencies part of the funding as well? Should they?

A4a. Most  should  go  to  NSF,  but  agencies  participating  in  the  initiative  (e.g.,
NOAA)  need  some  support  to  fund  intramural  research  and  related  activities.  Fur-
ther details of my proposals on allocation are included in my written testimony.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Stephen  P.  Leatherman,  Chair  Professor  and  Director,  International
Hurricane  Research  Center  &  Laboratory  for  Coastal  Research,  Florida  Inter-
national University

Questions submitted by Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. What are the current major gaps in research to better forecast hurricanes? Does
the proposed legislation H.R. 2407 and NOAA’s Hurricane Forecasting Improve-
ment Plan address these needs?

A1. A major problem in better forecasting hurricane intensity is understanding the
vertical  transport  of  energy  through  turbulence  in  the  hurricane  wind  field.  Turbu-
lent eddies exist at a range of scales, which are smaller than a two kilometer grid—
such  a  fine  grid  would  require  considerable  more  computer  power  than  presently
available and at phenomenal expense.

Questions submitted by Chairman Brian Baird
Q1. As  you  and  many  of  the  witnesses  stated  in  their  testimony,  social  science  re-
search  plays  a  crucial  role  in  better  understanding  and  improving  hurricane
preparedness and response. What areas of social and behavioral science research
do  you  consider  to  be  highest  priority  areas?  How  are  the  results  of  such  re-
search  being  translated  into  operational  practice?  Have  you  encountered,  or  are
you  aware  of  any  impediments  to  applying  the  findings  from  social  and  behav-
ioral sciences to disaster planning, recovery and response activities? If so, do you
have any suggestions as to how these impediments could be addressed?

A1. Two  major  areas  to  be  addressed  by  social  scientists  are  mitigation  and  evacu-
ation. Recently an IHRC coastal resource economist developed the first quantitative
evacuation  model,  which  when  fully  developed,  will  provide  considerable  guidance
regarding hurricane forecasts with respect to individual decision-making. The public
has  little  knowledge  of  building  safety  in  windstorms  and  people  largely  select
houses  based  on  the  number  of  bedrooms,  bathrooms,  location  and  appearance.  In
addition it has been problematic to get the public to mitigate the windstorm hazard,
largely  because  of  the  cost  and  lack  of  information  of  what  can  be  done.  The  Wall
of  Wind  research  can  demonstrate  the  value  of  new  products  and  technologies  to
make your house hurricane resistant and those that are cost effective. The best way
to transfer this information to the public is through the mass media of TV as backed
up with detailed information on a web site, which is another goal of the IHRC.
Q2. In  his  testimony  Dr.  Prevatt  stated  that  increased  support  for  research  on
strengthening  the  existing  built  infrastructure  and  developing  cost  effective  ret-
rofit and mitigation measures would be the most effective way to reduce damage
and economic losses from hurricanes. Would you comment on what priority you
would  assign  to  such  research  and  development  efforts  within  the  context  of  a
national hurricane research program?

A2. Approximately  99  percent  of  the  problem  is  strengthening  existing  houses
through  retrofitting  as  only  one  percent  of  the  building  stock  is  new  homes.  More
than  70  companies,  including  DuPont  and  3M,  have  requested  that  we  test  their
new  products  and  technologies  that  could  be  used  to  mitigate  hurricane  damage  in
a cost effective manner.
Q3. How  much  of  the  potential  improvement  possible  in  the  prediction  of  hurricane
intensity  will  come  from  the  availability  of  increasingly  more  powerful  com-
puters, which in turn will permit increasingly smaller computational grid spac-
ing  in  the  numerical  simulations  you  do?  Will  advances  in  computer  power,
which have been steady and continuous, solve the hurricane intensity prediction
problem?

A3. More powerful computers are necessary, but not sufficient, for improvements in
the prediction of hurricane intensity; this is a much more difficult problem than the
landfall area forecast, which is reaching the limits of predictability.

Question submitted by Representative Vernon J. Ehlers
Q1. How could the hurricane initiative help encourage development and adoption of

necessary building codes?

A1. Better  building  codes  will  follow  from  research  that  focuses  on  how  things
break—the  purpose  of  the  full-scale,  destructive  testing  by  the  Wall  of  Wind  hurri-
cane simulator. At present, we have only anecdotal evidence from post-storm inspec-
tions  and  empiricism  (equations,  not  real  data)  for  the  establishment  of  building
codes.

Questions submitted by Representative Mario Diaz-Balart
Q1. You discuss FIU’s work with NOAA, but how much work does FIU do with NSF
with  regards  to  hurricane  research?  Do  you  see  close  collaboration  between  the
two  agencies?  If  so,  how  is  this  working?  If  not,  do  you  think  there  should  be
collaboration?

A1. FIU  has  received  some  grants  over  the  years  from  NSF;  presently  we  have  a
$200k grant for wind engineering research (e.g., Wall of Wind) and about the same
amount for atmospheric science research. In addition, we have recently been notified
of  a  new  award  of  $390k  for  socioeconomic  research.  NSF  does  not  have  an  inte-
grated  hurricane  research  program;  these  grants  come  from  difference  divisions  of
NSF. Also, the level of funding from NSF is generally constrained.
Q2. Your  testimony  indicates  that  ‘‘understanding  air-sea  interactions’’  should  be  a
medium  priority  versus  a  high  priority.  Likewise,  you  place  ‘‘improved  observa-
tions’’  as  a  high  priority,  as  opposed  to  the  National  Science  Board’s  rec-
ommendation  that  it  be  a  medium  priority.  What  is  your  rational  for  these  dif-
ferences in priority rankings?

A2. Air-sea  interactions  is  very  important  with  respect  to  hurricane  intensification
(deserves  a  high  priority),  but  air-sea  interaction  research  can  also  involve  many
other  areas  of  far  less  importance.  We  gave  a  high  priority  rating  to  observations,
especially  for  field  measurements  of  storm  surges  so  that  the  models  can  be  cali-
brated and verified, which has not been done in the past. Also, direct measurements
of  storm  surges  are  important  in  partitioning  the  damage  from  water  vs.  wind,
which continues to be a major issue in insurance claims as evidenced by Hurricane
Katrina.
Q3. Some  of  the  research  your  institution  conducts  is  Florida-oriented,  but  would
seem to have national implications—specifically the work you are doing in mate-
rials, methodologies and techniques related to housing in hurricane prone areas.
Considering  that  the  work  is  partially  funded  by  the  private  sector,  how  much
of the results of your research can you disseminate for public use?

A3. All  of  the  research  that  is  being  conducted  by  FIU  will  benefit  the  public.  We
are conducting some proprietary research of new hurricane mitigation products and
technologies  for  private  companies  where  there  are  patents  pending.  However,  this
research  will  benefit  the  public  if  these  new  products  prove  to  be  cost  effective  in
strengthening houses and businesses.
Q4. In  your  written  testimony,  you  list  some  of  the  areas  in  which  FIU  is  currently
conducting research. This includes an assessment of the social consequences and
the  human  impacts  of  hurricanes,  specifically  how  they  affect  perceptions  and
attitudes influencing critical issues such as evacuation.
a. Have you done any work on the complementary side, of government planning

for effectively responding to hurricane-caused disasters?

b. How receptive are emergency managers at the local, State and national levels
to suggestions, comments or criticisms? Do you see their perceptions and atti-
tudes  influencing  not  only  their  planning  for  emergency  situations,  but  also
their actually responding to them?

A4a,b. Professor Dario Moreno at FIU and the Metropolitan Center have conducted
some  research  regarding  government  planning,  especially  involving  evacuations.
One  case  study  involved  the  evacuation  that  occurred  and  costs  incurred  based  on
the forecast of Hurricane Charley in 2004 making landfall in the Tampa area.
Q5. The  authorizations  set  forth  in  this  bill  are  total  amounts.  So,  how  should  the
money be divided between NSF and NOAA to carry out the initiative? Are other
‘‘coordinating’’  federal  agencies  to  receive  part  of  the  funding  as  well?  Should
