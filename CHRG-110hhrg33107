3. NIST Overview

Founded in 1901, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
developed  and  promoted  measurement,  standards,  and  technology  to  enhance  pro-
ductivity,  facilitate  trade,  and  improve  quality  of  life.  NIST  is  a  non-regulatory
agency of the U.S. Commerce Department’s Technology Administration.

NIST  operates  in  two  primary  locations:  Gaithersburg,  MD  and  Boulder,  CO.  It
also  operates  two  institutes  jointly  with  other  organizations:  the  Center  for  Ad-
vanced  Research  in  Biotechnology  in  Rockville,  MD  (with  the  University  of  Mary-
land) and JILA in Boulder, CO (with the University of Colorado).

NIST’s  staff  includes  approximately  2,700  scientist,  engineers,  technicians,  and
support  personnel.  In  addition,  1,800  associates  complement  the  staff,  and  NIST
partners  with  about  1,500  manufacturing  specialists  and  staff  at  affiliated  centers
around  the  country.  Three  NIST  scientists  have  earned  the  Nobel  Prize  in  the  last
10 years.

NIST carries out its mission through four cooperative programs:

• NIST laboratories—conduct research supporting U.S. technology infrastruc-
ture  by  developing  tools  to  measure,  evaluate  and  standardize,  enabling  U.S.
companies  to  innovate  and  remain  competitive.  NIST  helps  U.S.  companies,
workers, and consumers by ensuring that standards are used to create a level
playing field—not a barrier to trade—in the global marketplace.

• Baldridge  National  Quality  Program—promotes  excellence  among  U.S.
manufacturers,  service  companies,  educational  institutions,  and  health  care

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:12 Sep 10, 2007 Jkt 033107 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\021507\33107 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

providers;  conducts  outreach  programs  and  manages  the  annual  Malcolm
Baldridge  National  Quality  Award  recognizing  performance  excellence  and
quality.

• Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership—offers  technical  and  business  as-
sistance  services  to  improve  the  productivity  and  competitiveness  of  small
manufacturers through a nationwide network of local centers. The centers are
funded  by  a  one-third  equal  match  from  federal,  state,  and  fees  charged  for
services.

• Advanced Technology Program—accelerates the development of high-risk,
innovative technologies that promise broad benefits for the Nation by co-fund-
ing R&D partnerships with the private sector, including universities.

NIST laboratories are comprised of seven labs and a technical program, and are

funded under the Scientific and Technical Research Services (STRS) account.

• Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL)—works to improve qual-
ity  and  productivity  in  the  U.S.  construction.  The  lab  also  works  to  reduce
human and economic loss due to fires, earthquakes, wind, and other hazards.
• Chemical  Science  and  Technology  Laboratory  (CSTL)—conducts  re-
search  in  measurement  science  and  develops  the  chemical,  biochemical,  and
chemical  engineering  measurements,  data,  models,  and  reference  standards
that  are  required  to  enhance  U.S.  industrial  competitiveness  in  the  world
market and to improve public health, safety and environmental quality.

• Electronics  and  Electrical  Engineering  Laboratory  (EEEL)—provides
the  fundamental  basis  for  all  electrical  measurements  in  the  U.S.  and  ad-
vances standards for the electronics and electrical industries.

• Information Technology Laboratory (ITL)—conducts research and devel-
ops  test  methods  and  standards  for  emerging  and  rapidly  changing  informa-
tion  technologies.  ITL  focuses  on  technologies  to  improve  the  usability,  reli-
ability, and security of computers and computer networks for work and home.
• Manufacturing  Engineering  Laboratory  (MEL)—develops  measurement
methods, standards, and technologies to improve U.S. manufacturing capabili-
ties.  MEL  researchers  work  with  industry  to  achieve  greater  efficiency  and
productivity  with  improved  measurements  and  standards,  both  dimensional
and mechanical. MEL also maintains the basic units for measuring mass and
length in the United States.

• Materials  Science  and  Engineering  Laboratory  (MSEL)—anticipates
and responds to industry material-science needs in areas including microelec-
tronics,  automobiles,  and  health  care.  MSEL  houses  the  Nation’s  only  fully
equipped cold neutron research facility.

• Physics Laboratory (PL)—provides measurement services and research for
electronic, optical, and radiation technology. Research on atomic clocks at PL
has led to the world’s most accurate timing devices, critical for the Global Po-
sitioning  System  (GPS),  financial  markets,  and  electrical  power  grid  testing.
Over  the  last  10  years,  three  scientists  from  PL  have  won  the  Nobel  Prize.
• Technology  Services—provides  technology  products  and  services  including
support  for  NIST  calibrations,  Standard  Reference  Materials,  Standard  Ref-
erence Data, and Weights and Measures; coordination of documentary stand-
ards  activities;  training  of  foreign  standards  officials;  laboratory  accredita-
tions;  facilitating  partnerships  between  NIST  researchers  and  U.S.  industry;
and access to the NIST Research Library.

In addition, NIST has two national research facilities.

• NIST  Center  for  Neutron  Research  (NCNR)—provides  an  intense  source
of  neutrons  used  to  probe  the  molecular  and  atomic  structure  and  dynamics
of  a  wide  range  of  materials.  This  facility  is  used  heavily  by  industry.  In
2006,  researchers  from  over  40  national  labs,  140  U.S.  universities,  and  60
U.S.  companies  conducted  research  at  the  facility  in  collaboration  with  NIST
scientists.

• Center  for  Nanoscale  Science  and  Technology  (CNST)—leverages  the
unique  capabilities  of  the  NIST  Advanced  Measurement  Laboratory  complex,
providing state-of-the-art facilities for nanomanufacturing and nanometrology
where  industry,  universities  and  other  federal  laboratories  can  collaborate  in

solving  critical  measurement  and  fabrication  issues  necessary  to  convert
nano-discoveries into products.

NIST also manages two programs that support small businesses.

• Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP) is a proven public/private part-
nership  in  all  50  states  and  Puerto  Rico  with  the  mission  of  improving  the
competitiveness  of  small  and  medium-sized  manufacturers.  In  FY05,  MEP,  a
network  of  59  centers,  assisted  more  than  16,000  small  manufacturers,  pro-
viding a ten to one return on federal investment. In a survey of approximately
25  percent  of  MEP  clients,  they  reported  over  $1.3  billion  in  cost  savings  di-
rectly  attributed  to  the  program’s  assistance  as  well  as  creating  $6.25  billion
in  new  or  retained  sales.  The  program  also  helped  create/retain  more  than
53,000  jobs  and  increased  investment  by  $2.25  billion  returned  to  the  econ-
omy.

• The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) was created to foster economic
growth through the development of innovative technologies. Through private/
public partnerships, ATP’s early stage investment is accelerating the develop-
ment  of  high-risk,  broadly  enabling  technologies  and  helping  bridge  the  gap
between  the  laboratory  and  the  market  place.  Through  May  2004,  ATP  co-
funded 736 projects with 1,468 participants. Sixty-six percent of ATP projects
are  led  by  small  businesses,  while  more  than  160  different  colleges  and  uni-
versities have participated in ATP projects. Benefit-cost studies from approxi-
mately 40 projects indicate an eight to one return on investment.

NIST Budget Summary

Chairman WU. The Subcommittee now stands in order.
I  want  to  welcome  everybody  to  the  first  hearing  of  the  Tech-
nology  and  Innovation  Subcommittee.  It  is  only  fitting  that  with
the Subcommittee’s focus on technology, competitiveness, and inno-
vation  that  our  first  hearing  is  on  the  National  Institute  of  Stand-
ards  and  Technology,  NIST.  For  over  100  years,  NIST  has  done
outstanding work to promote the public welfare and support indus-
trial  growth:  from  setting  standards  for  uniform  pipe  threads  on
fire hydrants to the time measurements that make electronic finan-
cial transactions and the Global Positioning System, or GPS, work,
NIST  has  always  been  responsive  to  industry’s  and  the  public’s
needs.

NIST’s development of uniform pipe thread standards for fire hy-
drants  was  one  of  NIST’s  first  success  stories.  Three  years  after
NIST’s  creation,  a  fire  in  Baltimore  largely  destroyed  the  city,  be-
cause when adjacent fire companies within a 100-mile radius came
to the assistance of Baltimore, they found that their hoses and the
fire  hydrants  in  Baltimore  didn’t  have  a  uniform  standard  and
didn’t work together. NIST solved the problem over time.

However, when I mention NIST to my colleagues, most don’t rec-
ognize  that  name  as  a  federal  agency.  Perhaps  the  Manufacturing
Extension  Program,  or  MEP,  perhaps  the  Advanced  Technology
Program have a little visibility in the Congress and among my con-
stituents.  But  when  I  meet  with  industry  representatives,  while
their  technical  staff  may  know  about  NIST,  frequently,  the  busi-
ness executives and line folks do not.

During  the  next  two  years,  I  hope  to  educate  my  colleagues  in
Congress  and  the  broader  public  about  the  great  importance  of
NIST. I know that Dr. Jeffrey shares this goal as well.

Now,  on  to  the  issue  at  hand:  the  Administration’s  fiscal  year
2008  budget  request  for  NIST.  I  am  glad  that  the  Administration
has recognized the importance of at least a portion of NIST’s work
as  outlined  in  the  American  Competitiveness  Initiative.  Congress
and  the  prior  Administration  have  long  been  supportive  of  the
NIST  lab  programs.  During  the  past  15  years,  NIST’s  lab  budget
has  increased  by  130  percent.  When  President  Clinton  took  office,
the  NIST  lab  budget  was  $163  million.  Eight  years  later,  it  was
$313  million.  In  addition,  Congress  had  also  provided  more  than
$310  million  for  the  construction  of  new  lab  facilities.  There  are
few  federal  agencies  that  have  grown  so  rapidly  over  the  past  dec-
ade.  The  Science  and  Technology  Committee  has  always  been
NIST’s strongest supporter.

I  am  concerned  that  this  Administration  follows  a  strategy  of
paying  for  increases  in  the  lab  programs  and  construction  by  cut-
ting  funding  for  the  MEP  and  proposing  repeatedly  to  eliminate
ATP. Both of these programs are successful public/private partner-
ships, which have contributed to American innovation and competi-
tiveness. I hope that we can break this cycle where every year the
Administration  proposes  either  eliminating  or  cutting  these  two
programs and then Congress has to restore the funding.

NIST  has  not  had  an  authorization  for  all  its  programs  since
1992, and I intend to break this cycle, also. I want to move a com-
plete  NIST  authorization  bill  through  Congress.  I  am  hoping  that
the  Administration  will  work  with  me  on  this  effort.  We  need  to

move  an  authorization  bill  which  sets  NIST  on  a  path  to  broadly
support  innovation  and  competitiveness  in  the  United  States  and
with  our  friends  and  competitors  around  the  world.  We  are  in  a
global  race  for  economic  competitiveness  and  we  can’t  afford  to
stand  idly  by  and  watch  our  economy  burn  to  the  ground  as  hap-
pened to Baltimore 100 years go.

Now,  I  would  like  to  recognize  the  Ranking  Member  of  the  Sub-
committee, the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey, for his open-
ing remarks.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Wu follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN DAVID WU

I want to welcome everyone to the first hearing of the Technology and Innovation
Subcommittee.  It  seems  only  fitting  that  with  the  Subcommittee’s  focus  on  tech-
nology,  competitiveness,  and  innovation  our  first  hearing  is  on  the  National  Insti-
tute  of  Standards  and  Technology—NIST.  For  over  100  years,  NIST  has  done  out-
standing  work  to  promote  the  public  welfare  and  support  industrial  growth:  from
setting  standards  for  uniform  pipe  threads  on  fire  hydrants  to  the  time  measure-
ments  that  make  electronic  financial  transactions  and  the  Global  Positioning  Sys-
tem  (GPS)  functional.  NIST  has  always  been  responsive  to  industry’s  and  the
public’s needs.

NIST’s  development  of  uniform  pipe  thread  standards  for  fire  hydrants  was  one
of NIST’s first success stories. Three years after NIST’s creation, a fire in Baltimore
largely destroyed the city. Why? Because when the fire companies from within a 100
miles  radius  showed  up,  none  of  their  hoses  would  fit  Baltimore’s  fire  hydrants  be-
cause there was no uniform standard. NIST solved the problem.

Now,  on  to  the  issue  at  hand—the  Administration’s  FY08  budget  request  for
NIST.  I  am  glad  that  the  Administration  has  recognized  the  importance  of  at  least
a  portion  of  NIST  work  as  outlined  in  the  American  Competitiveness  Initiative
(ACI). Congress and the prior Administration have long been supportive of the NIST
lab  programs.  During  the  past  15  years,  NIST’s  lab  budget  has  increased  by  130

eight years later it was $313 million. In addition, Congress had also provided more
than  $310  million  for  the  construction  of  new  lab  facilities.  There  are  few  federal
agencies  that  have  grown  so  rapidly  over  the  past  decade.  The  Science  and  Tech-
nology Committee has always been one of NIST’s strongest supporters.

I  am  concerned  that  the  Bush  Administration  continues  to  follow  a  strategy  of
paying for increases in the lab programs and construction by cutting funding for the
MEP and eliminating the ATP. Both of these programs are successful public/private
partnerships  which  have  contributed  to  American  innovation  and  competitiveness.
I  hope  that  we  can  break  this  cycle  where  every  year  the  Administration  proposes
either  eliminating  or  cutting  these  two  programs  and  then  Congress  restores  the
funding.

NIST  has  not  had  an  authorization  for  all  its  programs  since  1992  and  I  intend
to  break  this  drought.  I  want  to  move  a  complete  NIST  authorization  bill  through
Congress.  I’m  hoping  that  the  Administration  will  work  with  me  on  this  effort.  We
need  to  move  an  authorization  bill  which  sets  NIST  on  a  path  to  broadly  support
innovation  and  competitiveness  in  the  United  States.  We  are  in  a  global  race  for
economic  competitiveness—we  can’t  afford  to  stand  idly  by  and  watch  our  economy
burn to the ground as happened in Baltimore, 100 years ago.

Now,  I  would  like  to  recognize  the  Ranking  Member  of  the  Subcommittee,  Dr.

Gingrey, for his opening remarks.

Mr. GINGREY. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Good  morning.  I  am  very  excited  for  our  subcommittee’s  first
hearing of the 110th Congress, and I want to thank my friend from
Oregon, Mr. Wu, for organizing this hearing. And I look forward to
working with him over the next two years on technology and inno-
vation, issues that are vital to our economic competitiveness.

It  is  quite  important  that  this  first  hearing  in  the  Technology
and Innovation Subcommittee is about one of our nation’s scientific
stars, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST.

Almost  every  federal  agency  and  United  States  industry  sector
uses  the  standards,  measurements,  and  certification  services  that
NIST  laboratories  provide.  The  breadth  of  NIST’s  applications
stretches  from  guidelines  on  the  accuracy  and  reliability  of  elec-
tronic  voting  machines  to  research  into  the  causes  of  building  and
structural  failures  and  to  making  health  care  information  tech-
nology  inter-operability  a  reality  in  a  health  care  delivery  system.
A  must-do,  in  my  opinion,  to  deliver  the  kind  of  radical  reforms
needed  to  improve  the  quality  and  lower  the  cost  of  delivering
health care in this country.

The future of many cutting-edge technologies also depends on the
research  and  technical  expertise  of  NIST  laboratories.  Emerging
fields, such as nanotechnology and bioengineering, will not become
mature  industries  and  markets  without  the  existence  of  scientif-
ically-based  industrial  measurements  and  standards.  Beginning
last  year,  the  President  recognized  the  important  role  that  NIST
plays in our nation’s economic security and started NIST on a path
to  double  its  core  research  and  facilities  budget  by  2017.  I  fully
support  the  President’s  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  and
the  Office  of  Science  at  the  Department  of  Energy.  I  look  forward
to  hearing  more  details  today  about  the  role  NIST  will  play  in  the
President’s American Competitiveness Initiative.

And I am interested to hear the Administration’s rationale in re-
questing  only  $46  million  for  the  Manufacturing  Extension  Part-
nership, the MEP program. The MEP program helps small and me-
dium-sized  United  States  manufacturers  optimize  their  operations
and  remain  competitive  in  the  global  economy.  And  it  is  a  critical
program  that  is  worthy  of  taxpayer  dollars.  It  deserves  the  $106
million  that  Congress  had  provided  in  recent  years,  and  I  intend
to  work  with  my  colleagues  to  see  that  it  once  again  receives  an
adequate appropriation for fiscal year 2008.

Chairman  Wu,  I  am  pleased  to  have  Mike  Ryan,  President  and
CEO  of  TUG  Technologies,  a  company  that  is  located  in  my  dis-
trict, in Marietta, Georgia, with us today to discuss the importance
of the MEP program. He has vast experience with a variety of MEP
programs in different states of this great country and has some ex-
citing success stories to share with this subcommittee.

I thank all of the witnesses for taking the time to be here today.
I only wish that I could stay to hear what will be, I know, a fruitful
and  productive  debate.  However,  as  you  know,  a  good  friend  and
colleague,  our  own  Dr.  Charlie  Norwood,  passed  away  this  week,
and his funeral is this afternoon in Augusta, Georgia. And in order
to  offer  my  condolences  to  his  wife  and  family,  I  will  be  joining
many  of  my  colleagues  as  we  leave  here  in  just  a  few  minutes  to
fly  back  to  his  services.  So  please  keep  his  family  and  friends  in
your thoughts and prayers.

And,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my  time,  and  I

thank you.

Chairman WU. Thank you, Dr. Gingrey.
And  it  is  my  understanding  that  the  timeline  for  meeting  down-
stairs  for  our  friend  Charlie  is  in  about  12  minutes.  And  I  just
want  to  recognize  that,  while  many  of  us  are  going,  many  of  us
would  like  to  be  there.  Charlie  was  a  gentleman  and  a  principled
fellow.  I  enjoyed  working  with  him  on  the  Education  Committee.
And  I  also  went  toe-to-toe  with  him  on  occasion,  and  he  did  each
of  those  equally  well.  And  I  think,  as  the  President  would  say,  he
was a good man.

Mr. GINGREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman WU. Thank you.
I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  all  additional  statements  be  sub-
mitted  by  Committee  Members  to  be  included  in  the  record.  With-
out objection, so ordered.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
To  compete  in  the  global  economy,  America  needs  technological  innovation.  Inno-
vation is often expensive, however, and not always immediately profitable. This can
be  especially  problematic  for  small  businesses.  For  me,  the  question  isn’t  WHETH-
ER  we  should  help  small  businesses  get  the  technology  and  training  they  need,  it’s
HOW we should do so.

Today, we will hear about two such programs: the Manufacturing Extension Part-

12

nership and Advance Technology Program.

The  President’s  budget  proposes  drastic  cuts  to  these  programs.  I  am  eager  to
hear from today’s witnesses about this. . . not only about whether they agree with
these  cuts,  but  also  what  kind  of  alternative  ideas  they  have  for  assisting  small
businesses’ technological innovation and training.

I yield back the balance of my time.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Ehlers follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE VERNON J. EHLERS

NIST  is  extremely  important  to  U.S.  competitiveness.  With  three  Nobel  prizes
awarded  in  less  than  a  decade,  I  don’t  think  anyone  would  disagree  that  the  re-
search  environment  fostered  at  NIST  is  enviable  or  that  NIST’s  mastery  of  culti-
vating innovation is truly remarkable.

I am glad the witnesses today will highlight some of the outreach endeavors NIST
is engaged in. I look forward to determining with my colleagues how programs like
the  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  (MEP)  and  Advanced  Technology  Pro-
gram (ATP) can be strengthened. I believe there are opportunities for improvement,
though  we  must  make  sure  we  resist  changes  based  purely  on  ideological  grounds.
I  am  very  pleased  that  the  President’s  requests  includes  funding  ($28  million)  to
begin much needed repairs and improvements to the NIST facilities in Boulder, CO.
I’ve  worked  at  these  facilities  and  have  seen  first-hand  some  of  their  limitations.
They were built more than 50 years ago and cannot provide the stable environment
required for today’s precision’s measurements. For example, the scientists must use
duct  tape  and  plastic  sheeting  to  protect  their  experiments  from  the  unpredictable
air flow in the buildings’ ventilation systems. I applaud Dr. Jeffrey for undertaking
a comprehensive review of the needs of the lab and assessing the most cost-effective
way to upgrade the facilities.

Chairman WU. We have a very distinguished panel of witnesses,
and  I  want  to  thank  them  for  taking  the  time  to  travel  the  dis-
tance, whether it is 2,500 miles or a dangerous 12 miles to Capitol
Hill. And in this subcommittee, at least, the dangerous part of the
journey  is  over.  You  will  find  an  inquiring,  friendly  environment.
Before  we  begin,  I  would  like  to  make  a  short  introduction  of
each  of  the  panelists,  other  than  Mr.  Ryan,  who  has  already  been
very well introduced by Dr. Gingrey.

First, Dr. Bill Jeffrey has been the Director of NIST for the past
year  and  a  half.  Before  that,  he  was  at  the  White  House  Office  of
Science  and  Technology  Policy,  the  Defense  Advanced  Research
Projects Agency, and he started his career at the Defense Airborne
Reconnaissance Office. Since coming to NIST, Dr. Jeffrey has been
their strongest advocate within this Administration.

Dr. Stan Williams of the Hewlett-Packard Corporation is a senior
HP  fellow  and  founding  Director  of  the  Quantum  Research  Group.
I  have  never  been  able  to  find  anything  there,  and  maybe  you  can
tell  me  what  I  have  been  missing.  Dr.  Williams  is  an  expert  in
nanotechnology and quantum computing. He has been awarded the
Julius  Springer  Award  for  Applied  Physics,  the  Feynman  Prize  in
Nanotechnology,  the  Dreyfus  Teacher-Scholar  Award,  a  Sloan
Foundation  fellowship,  and  was  named  by  Scientific  American  as
one of the 50 top technology leaders.

Mr.  Michael  Borrus  is  the  founding  general  partner  of  X/Seed
Capital,  a  seed-focused,  early-stage  venture  fund.  That,  plus  your
youth,  must  be  where  the  ‘‘X’’  comes  from.  He  has  taught  at  UC–
Berkeley and is the author of three books on high-tech issues.

Mr. Peter Murray is the Vice President of Welch Allyn, a promi-
nent  manufacturer  of  patient-monitoring  equipment  with  a  foot-
print  across  the  world  but  with  a  location,  importantly,  in  Bea-

verton,  Oregon.  His  company  has  relied  upon  the  services  of  the
Oregon  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership,  or  the  MEP,  center
in Oregon.

And Dr. Gingrey has already introduced Mr. Ryan.
And if I may have the envelope, please. No envelope.
Gentlemen, I understand that you all have submitted substantial
materials in writing. We have a five-minute period for a statement,
and  if  you  could,  please,  summarize  and  point  out  the  highlights
or lowlights, or both, of your written testimony.

Dr. Jeffrey, let us begin with you.

STATEMENT OF DR. WILLIAM JEFFREY, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL
INSTITUTE  OF  STANDARDS  AND  TECHNOLOGY,  TECH-
NOLOGY  ADMINISTRATION,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF  COM-
MERCE
Dr. JEFFREY. Thank you.
Chairman  Wu,  Ranking  Member  Gingrey,  and  Members  of  the
Subcommittee, I am pleased to present the President’s 2008 budget
request for NIST. This is a strong budget that will further enhance
our  abilities  to  support  the  measurements  and  standards  needs  of
U.S. industry and academia.

NIST  has  a  long  history  of  being  at  the  forefront  of  new  innova-
tions  through  our  measurements  and  standards.  In  2003,  the  Na-
tional  Academy  of  Engineering  identified  the  greatest  engineering
achievements  of  the  20th  century.  NIST  measurements  and  stand-
ards  were  integral  to  the  successful  development  and  adoption  of
virtually every one.

Nineteen  retrospective  studies  of  economic  impact  show  that,  on
average,  NIST  labs  generated  a  benefit-to-cost  ratio  of  44:1  to  the
U.S.  economy.  The  high  rate  of  return  results  from  the  fact  that
new measurements or standards benefit entire industries or sectors
of the economy as opposed to individual companies.

For example, NIST researchers recently developed new measure-
ment techniques that cut up to 80 percent of the cost and time for
industry  to  develop  advanced  materials.  As  one  industry  scientist
put  it,  NIST’s  scientists  are  reawakening  a  major  element  of  cre-
ativity that analytical science almost lost.

NIST also operates world-class user facilities. Last year, approxi-
mately 2,000 researchers from 60 different industries leveraged the
NIST  Center  for  Neutron  Research,  or  the  NCNR.  A  National
Academy  of  Science’s  report  describes  the  NCNR’s  capability  to
image  and  operate  a  fuel  cell  as  ‘‘a  considerable  achievement  and
one  of  the  most  significant  analytical  advances  in  the  membrane
fuel  cell  realized  in  decades.’’  Industry  scientists  have  stated  that
the  research  performed  at  the  NCNR  has  allowed  them  to  jump
five years ahead in fuel cell development.

To prepare for the future, NIST is working with industry to iden-
tify  critical  measurement  barriers  to  innovation,  evaluating  its
physical  infrastructure,  forming  new  and  strengthening  existing
partnerships, and updating ways to stimulate the knowledge trans-
fer from its labs to industry and academia.

The  increased  funding  provided  through  the  budget  request  will
directly  support  innovative  advances  in  broad  sectors  of  the  econ-
omy  as  well  as  improve  the  safety  and  quality  of  life  for  our  citi-

zens.  For  example,  the  research  initiatives  will  speed  the  develop-
ment  and  foster  the  adoption  of  nanotechnology  products  and  pro-
vide  the  physical  measurements  to  ensure  their  safety,  accelerate
the revolutionary economic potential in exploiting the unique prop-
erties  of  the  quantum  world,  provide  confidence  and  reduce  uncer-
tainty  in  measurements  supporting  global  climate  change  models,
reduce  the  risk  to  communities  as  they  encroach  on  hurricane-
prone  coasts  and  fire-prone  wildland  urban  interface  regions,  and
enhance  the  safety  of  new  and  existing  structures  from  the  cata-
strophic impact of earthquakes.

To  meet  the  demands  for  measurements  at  ever-smaller  scales,
at  faster  rates,  and  with  more  accuracy,  it  requires  excellent  lab-
oratory  and  user  facilities.  The  budget  request,  therefore,  includes
capacity  and  capability  improvements  at  both  our  Boulder  campus
and the NCNR.

The  budget  request  for  MEP  is  identical  to  last  year’s  request
and  is  a  reduction  of  $58.3  million  from  the  fiscal  year  2006  en-
acted.

I recognize the difference in priority between the Administration
and Congress regarding the federal funding level for the MEP pro-
gram.  One  thing  that  you  can  be  certain  of,  regardless  of  the  final
appropriations: NIST will execute the program in the most effective
manner possible to support the Nation’s small manufacturers.

No  funds  for  ATP  are  requested  in  the  President’s  2008  budget.
The  2006  enacted  budget  was  consistent  with  the  phase-out  of  the
program. The 2007 Joint Resolution, however, included funding for
ATP.  And  I  understand  it  was  approved  by  the  Senate  last  night,
and  assuming  it  is  signed  by  the  President,  NIST  will  initiate  a
new competition in 2007.

In summary, recent NIST measurements and standards research
have  enabled  innovations  now  embedded  in  the  iPod,  body  armor,
saving the lives of domestic law enforcement officers and our serv-
ice  men  and  women  overseas,  and  diagnostic  screening  devices  for
cancer  patients  making  their  treatment  more  targeted  and  accu-
rate.  The  results  of  NIST  research  can  be  found  in  virtually  every
manufacturing and service industry.

For more than a century, NIST research has been critical to our
nation’s competitiveness. The increased funding requested for NIST
will  directly  support  innovations  in  broad  sectors  of  the  economy
that will, quite literally, define the 21st century.

Thank you, and I would be happy to answer any questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIAM JEFFREY

Chairman  Wu,  Ranking  Member  Gingrey  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I
am  pleased  to  appear  before  you  today  to  present  the  President’s  FY  2008  Budget
request  for  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST).  This  is  a
strong  budget  for  NIST  and  it  will  further  enhance  NIST’s  ability  to  support  the
measurement  and  standards  needs  of  U.S.  industry  and  universities.  The  FY  2008
request  of  $640.7  million  includes  $594.4  million  for  NIST’s  core  (encompassing
NIST’s research and facilities) and $46.3 million for the Hollings Manufacturing Ex-
tension  Partnership.  The  budget  for  the  NIST  core  represents  an  11  percent  in-
crease over the President’s FY 2007 request and a 21 percent increase over the pro-
posed FY 2007 joint resolution (H.J. Res. 20) recently passed by the House and sent
to the Senate. This funding supports NIST’s mission to promote U.S. innovation and
industrial  competitiveness  by  advancing  measurement  science,  standards  and  tech-
nology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.

NIST’s Impact on Innovation and the Economy

15

NIST has a long history of being at the forefront of new innovations through our
high-impact  measurements  and  standards.  In  2003,  the  National  Academy  of  Engi-
neering identified 20 of the greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century—
including automobiles, aircraft, lasers, computers, and the Internet. NIST measure-
ments  and  standards  were  integral  to  the  successful  development  and  adoption  of
virtually  every  one.  Now  NIST  is  paving  the  way  for  the  greatest  achievements  of
the 21st century which are still yet to be imagined.

NIST’s  measurement  science  and  standards  form  part  of  the  foundation  upon
which  innovation  is  built.  Just  as  the  Nation’s  physical  infrastructure  (e.g.,  roads
or power grid) define the Nation’s capacity to build and transport goods—the Nation
has  an  innovation  infrastructure  which  defines  the  Nation’s  capacity  to  innovate.
And  investment  in  long-term  basic  research  like  that  done  at  NIST  is  an  integral
component  of  the  innovation  infrastructure.  As  stated  in  the  National  Academy  of
Sciences’ Rising Above the Gathering Storm, ‘‘The power of research is demonstrated
not  only  by  single  innovations  but  by  the  ability  to  create  entire  new  industries.’’
NIST  researchers  are  world  leaders  in  their  fields.  They  frequently  arrive  at  the
‘‘cutting  edge’’  of  science  before  anyone  else.  And  once  there,  they  partner  with  in-
dustry  and  academia  to  identify  and  overcome  barriers  that  can  slow  or  even  halt
the progress of new innovations. With the proposed FY 2008 budget, NIST will con-
tinue developing the measurement and standards tools that enable U.S. industry to
maintain and enhance our global economic competitiveness.

NIST continues to meet the Nation’s highest priorities by focusing on high impact
research and investing in the capacity and capability of our user facilities and labs.
This  emphasis  is  validated  by  the  high  rate  of  return  to  the  Nation  that  the  NIST
labs  already  have  demonstrated.  Nineteen  retrospective  studies  of  economic  impact
show that, on average, NIST labs generated a benefit-to-cost ratio of 44:1 to the U.S.
economy.  The  high  rate  of  return  results  from  the  fact  that  new  measurements  or
standards  benefit  entire  industries  or  sectors  of  the  economy—as  opposed  to  indi-
vidual companies.

NIST  supports  U.S.  innovation  and  economic  competitiveness  primarily  through
its  measurements,  standards,  and  national  user  facilities.  Recent  NIST  successes
highlight  the  importance  of  each  of  these  critical  components  and  illustrate  how
NIST’s labs are able to return such a large benefit to the Nation:

Measurements—NIST  researchers  recently  developed  new  measurement  tech-
niques that allow for rapid and cost-effective assessments of advanced materials
that are used in a range of products from new detergents to improved adhesives
for  next-generation  electronics.  Previously,  it  could  cost  industry  $20  million  to
develop and understand the characteristics of one new material. With this NIST
measurement  advance,  the  cost  and  time  are  estimated  to  have  been  cut  by  80
percent. To facilitate the transfer of this technique to industry, NIST organized
an open consortium now consisting of 23 members that are learning to use and
adapt these new measurement techniques. As a scientist from Honeywell Inter-
national  put  it,  ‘‘. . .NIST  offers  an  invaluable  resource  to  show  what  can  be
done, and how to go about it. NIST Combinatorial Methods Center scientists are
reawakening  a  major  element  of  creativity  that  analytical  science  almost  lost.’’
Standards—Nanotechnology  has  the  potential  to  revolutionize  manufacturing.
And  one  of  the  most  promising  nanomaterials  is  the  carbon  nanotube.  Carbon
nanotubes  have  unique  electronic  and  mechanical  properties  that  lend  them-
selves  to  a  variety  of  applications,  ranging  from  the  development  of  stronger
and lighter materials to nanowires and transistors for miniature electronics. Re-
gardless of the potential application, the quality of the materials is paramount.
Unfortunately,  current  production  techniques  for  carbon  nanotubes  result  in
products with high levels of uncertainty in their quality and uniformity. To ad-
dress  this  concern,  NIST  is  currently  developing  a  carbon  nanotube  reference
material. This reference material, when deployed, can be used by any nanotube
manufacturer to validate their product’s quality, purity, and consistency and ac-
celerate the adoption of carbon nanotubes into more sophisticated devices.
National  User  Facilities—NIST  operates  world-class  user  facilities  that  benefit
the entire U.S. research community. Last year, approximately 2000 researchers
from  60  different  industries  across  the  country  leveraged  the  NIST  Center  for
Neutron  Research  (NCNR).  One  recently  developed  application  of  the  NCNR
was  to  image  the  interior  of  operating  fuel  cells  to  help  improve  the  efficiency
and durability of these devices. Large and small companies involved in the man-
ufacture or use of hydrogen fuel cells, including General Motors, Daimler-Chrys-
ler,  Dupont,  and  PlugPower,  have  benefited  from  this  new  capability.  The
NCNR is the premier facility in the world providing this capability. A National

Academy  of  Sciences  report  describes  the  NIST  efforts  in  regards  to  fuel  cell
technologies  as  ‘‘. . .a  considerable  achievement  and  one  of  the  most  significant
analytical advances in the membrane fuel cell realized in decades. The NIST fa-
cility offers the entire fuel cell community unique research opportunities that pre-
viously  eluded  them.’’  Industry  scientists  have  stated  that  the  research  per-
formed  at  the  NCNR  has  allowed  them  to  jump  five  years  ahead  in  terms  of
fuel cell development.

The  President  recognized  NIST’s  critical  role  for  the  Nation  as  part  of  the  Amer-
ican Competitiveness Initiative (ACI). The ACI describes NIST as: ‘‘. . .a high-lever-
age  federal  research  agency  that  performs  high-impact  basic  research  and  supports
the  successful  technical  translation  and  everyday  use  of  economically  significant  in-
novations. . .’’ Under the ACI, overall funding for NIST’s core, the National Science
Foundation,  and  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Science  is  together  slated  to
double by 2016.
Preparing for the Future

The  21st  century  will  be  defined  by  technology  innovations  that  fundamentally
change the products and services available, the way they are manufactured and pro-
vided,  and  the  impact  on  our  quality  of  life.  These  advances  will  arise  from  basic
research  now  beginning  in,  for  example,  nanotechnology,  quantum  science,  and  al-
ternative energies—all areas in which NIST has a strong and increasing focus with
its investments.

The  goal  of  increasing  physical  sciences  research  at  NIST  (along  with  that  sup-
ported  by  the  National  Science  Foundation  and  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Office
of  Science)  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  strategically  establish  the  programs,
plans,  and  infrastructure  that  will  more  than  double  the  impact  that  NIST  has  on
the  economy.  To  prepare  for  the  future,  NIST  is  working  with  industry  to  identify
critical  measurement  barriers  to  innovation,  evaluating  the  capacity  and  capability
of  NIST’s  physical  infrastructure,  forming  new  and  strengthening  existing  partner-
ships,  and  updating  the  ways  it  stimulates  the  knowledge  transfer  from  its  labs  to
industry and academia.

For  example,  over  the  past  year,  NIST  worked  with  over  1,000  experts  from  in-
dustry and universities to identify measurement barriers to innovation in a number
of  critical  industry  sectors.  Over  700  technical  barriers  were  identified,  analyzed,
and  documented  in  a  report.  NIST  is  now  in  the  process  of  working  with  industry,
universities, and other government agencies to address many of these identified bar-
riers over the coming years.

In  terms  of  facilities,  NIST  has  conducted  a  rigorous  evaluation  of  its  laboratory
capacity and capabilities on its Boulder, Colorado, campus. This review found facili-
ties’ shortfalls in our ability to meet both current and projected industry and univer-
sity  needs  in  a  number  of  important  areas.  Examples  include  the  high-speed  and
high-frequency measurements required for electronics, defense, and homeland secu-
rity;  measurements  and  tests  at  the  single  atom  level;  and  improved  methods  for
measuring time, an area expected to vastly improve navigation and positioning sys-
tems. Each technical area was evaluated in terms of necessary laboratory conditions
(to  include  stability  of  temperature,  vibration,  and  humidity,  as  well  as  air  cleanli-
ness).  As  a  result  of  this  assessment,  new  laboratory  space  to  meet  the  Nation’s
needs well into the 21st century is proposed in the FY 2008 budget (Boulder Build-
ing 1 Extension).

NIST  also  serves  industry  and  academia  by  being  a  steward  of  world-class  user
facilities.  As  part  of  the  ACI,  NIST  identified  two  important  opportunities  first
called  out  in  the  FY  2007  budget  and  enhanced  in  the  FY  2008  budget—increased
capacity  and  capability  of  the  NIST  Center  for  Neutron  Research  and  creation  of
the  NIST  Center  for  Nanoscale  Science  and  Technology.  Both  of  these  facilities  are
designed  to  stimulate  progress  in  support  of  our  nation’s  economic  competitiveness.
The  ACI  provides  NIST  the  opportunity  to  further  promote  U.S.  innovation  and
industrial  competitiveness.  With  focused,  world-class  research  and  facilities,  NIST
will  have  a  greater  impact  on  the  21st  century  economy  than  it  did  even  over  the
past century.
FY 2008 President’s Budget

The increased funding provided through the FY 2008 request will directly support
innovative  advances  in  broad  sectors  of  the  economy  as  well  as  improve  the  safety
and quality of life for our citizens. The following table summarizes the proposed FY
2008  budget.  In  this  table  we  show  both  the  FY  2007  President’s  budget  and  the
FY 2007 joint resolution (H.J. Res. 20) for comparisons as different baselines.

17

The FY 2008 budget was formulated with the FY 2007 President’s request as the
baseline. Since H.J. Res. 20 provides a smaller budget for the NIST core (STRS and
CRF)  than  the  FY  2007  President’s  request  by  $43.6  million,  some  proposed  initia-
tives  in  FY  2007  that  will  not  receive  full  funding  are  implicitly  contained  within
the President’s FY 2008 request. New initiatives are described in more detail below:
Scientific and Technical Research Services (STRS)
Enabling Nanotechnology from Discovery to Manufacture (+$6 million)

The  potential  market  for  products  containing  nanomaterials  is  estimated  at  over
$1  trillion  by  2015.  Because  of  their  small  size—a  thousand  times  thinner  than  a
human  hair—nanoscale  products  require  entirely  novel  ways  to  characterize  their
physical properties and fully exploit their unique characteristics in the manufacture
of new products.

In  FY  2007,  NIST  began  a  major  initiative  to  address  the  measurement  barriers
hindering rapid development of nanotechnologies. A new NIST Center for Nanoscale
Science  and  Technology  (CNST)  has  been  established  that  combines  both  research
and a state-of-the-art nanofabrication and nanometrology user facility.

The  research  initiatives  proposed  in  FY  2008  will  build  on  recent  NIST  advances

by:

• Developing  ways  to  measure  strength,  stress,  strain,  optical,  and  electronic
properties  of  nanostructures  to  improve  processes  and  understanding  of  fail-
ure mechanisms;

• Creating  three-dimensional,  high-resolution  imaging  methods  that  reveal  de-
tails of structure, chemical composition, and manufacturing defects and allow
researchers  to  view  nanostructures  as  they  interact  with  their  environment;
• Simulating  nanoscale  phenomena  with  computer  models  to  allow  economical

development of production methods for complex nanodevices; and

• Producing  the  measurement  techniques  required  to  address  the  interagency
efforts to characterize nanotechnology impacts to our health, safety, and envi-
ronment.

Measurements and Standards for the Climate Change Science Program (+$5 million)
The climate is changing. Determining how fast it is changing, and understanding
the complex relationships between all the environmental variables is a critical objec-
tive  of  the  U.S.  Climate  Change  Science  Program.  Many  different  climate  moni-
toring systems in space, in the air, and on the ground are currently monitoring solar
output as well as trapped and reflected heat by the Earth’s atmosphere. These sys-
tems  are  operated  by  many  countries  and  research  groups.  Establishment  of  abso-
lute  calibration  and  standard  references  will  allow  accurate  inter-comparisons  of
these  systems,  will  help  identify  small  environmental  changes  occurring  over  many
years, and will reduce uncertainties in the data input to global climate change mod-
els.

With  the  proposed  FY  2008  funding,  NIST  will,  working  in  coordination  with

other agencies, develop:

• An  international  irradiance  measurement  scale  to  be  used  in  rigorously  cali-
brating  satellite  light  intensity  instruments  prior  to  launch  to  ensure  suffi-
cient accuracy to allow valid comparisons among results from different instru-
ments or from data sets taken over different periods of time;

18

• New  instrument  design  strategies  and  quality  assurance  programs  to  opti-
mize  accuracy  and  stability  of  satellite-based  irradiance  measurement  sys-
tems;
• Techniques  for  generating  specific  types  of  aerosols  in  the  laboratory,  meas-
uring aerosol optical and physical properties, and for simulating aerosol prop-
erties that cannot yet be measured in the laboratory; and
• A database of critically evaluated data on aerosol properties collected at NIST

and elsewhere.

Enabling Innovation Through Quantum Science (+$4 million)

Unlike the laws of physics that govern our ‘‘every day’’ world, the laws of physics
that  govern  the  quantum  world  of  atoms,  electrons,  and  light  particles  are  fun-
damentally different. These quantum particles are able to interact in ways that ac-
cording  to  human  experience  would  seem  impossible.  For  example,  a  quantum  par-
ticle can actually be in two different places simultaneously.

Conceptualizing these phenomena is difficult to say the least, but developing ways
to exploit them for the development of technologically significant innovations is even
more  challenging.  NIST,  however,  has  world-class  scientists  who  are  leaders  in  the
emerging  field  of  quantum  information  science.  Three  NIST  scientists  have  won
Nobel Prizes in the last 10 years based on their work in this field. Many of the best
minds  in  physics  today  believe  that  applications  of  quantum  science  will  transform
the  21st  century  just  as  integrated  circuits  and  classical  electronics  revolutionized
the 20th century.

The  proposed  FY  2008  initiative  will  build  upon  NIST’s  significant  expertise  in
this  area,  and  leverage  the  collaborations  established  in  the  recently  created  Joint
Quantum Institute between the University of Maryland, NIST, and the National Se-
curity  Agency.  NIST  proposes  to  accelerate  the  potential  of  the  quantum  world  for
enhancing our nation’s competitiveness through research into:

puters to allow more complex logic operations;

formation between the components of a simple quantum computer;

• Quantum  ‘‘wires’’  that  use  ‘‘teleportation’’  techniques  to  reliably  transport  in-
• Quantum  memory  analogous  to  the  random  access  memory  of  today’s  com-
• Quantum  conversion  processes  that  transfer  information  from  one  form  of
quantum  information  to  another  (for  example,  ways  to  transfer  information
about the quantum characteristics of an atom to a photon); and
• Quantum based measurement tools such as optical clocks and single electron

counters.

Disaster Resilient Structures and Communities (+$4 million)

The  past  few  years  have  reminded  us  that  both  natural  hazards—including  ex-
treme  winds,  storm  surge,  wildland  fires,  earthquakes,  and  tsunamis—as  well  as
terrorist  actions,  are  a  continuing  and  significant  threat  to  U.S.  communities.  The
disaster  resilience  of  our  physical  infrastructure  and  communities  today  is  deter-
mined  in  large  measure  by  the  building  codes,  standards,  and  practices  used  when
they  were  built.  Many  of  these  legacy  codes,  standards,  and  practices—which  have
evolved  over  several  decades—are  oversimplified  and  inconsistent  with  current  risk
assessments. As construction and rebuilding costs continue to rise, there is increas-
ing recognition of the need to move from response and recovery to proactively identi-
fying and mitigating hazards that pose the greatest threats.

The proposed FY 2008 initiative will, working in coordination with other agencies,

develop:

• Standard methods to predict losses, evaluate disaster resilience, and estimate
cost-to-benefit  of  risk  management  strategies  at  the  community  and  regional
scales  that  local  officials  can  use  to  evaluate  and  mitigate  risks  via  land-use
planning and practices;
• Decision support tools to modernize codes, standards, and practices consistent
• A  validated  ‘‘computational  wind  tunnel’’  for  predicting  extreme  wind  effects
• Risk-based  storm  surge  maps  for  the  design  of  structures  in  coastal  regions.

National Earthquake Hazards Reduction (+$3.25 million)

Many earthquakes strike without warning. Within the U.S., more than 75 million
people are located in urban areas considered to be of moderate to high risk of earth-

quakes.  Just  the  economic  value  of  the  physical  structures  within  these  regions—
not  including  the  potential  loss  of  life  and  economic  disruption—is  valued  at  close
to  $8.6  trillion.  To  address  this  threat  Congress  (and  this  committee  in  particular)
has provided longstanding support for the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction
Program which NIST coordinates across the Federal Government.

This initiative will enhance the safety of:

• New  structures  by  establishing  and  promoting  performance-based  standards
for entire building designs and by accelerating the adoption of basic research
into the model building codes, standards, and practices; and

• Existing structures through research on actual building performance in earth-
quakes; developing structural performance models and tools; and establishing
cost-effective retrofit techniques for existing buildings.

Construction of Research Facilities (CRF)
Building  1  Extension  (B1E)—Enabling  Sustained  Scientific  Advancement  and  Inno-

vation (+$28 million)

When President Eisenhower dedicated the NIST facilities in Colorado in 1954, no
one  imagined  that  half  a  century  later  scientists  would  be  manipulating  matter
atom-by-atom.  Such  technological  advances  require  increasingly  complex  and  dif-
ficult  measurements—to  be  able  to  observe,  characterize,  and  create  structures  at
ever  smaller  spatial  scales.  As  the  structures  shrink  in  size,  small  fluctuations  in
temperature,  humidity,  air  quality,  and  vibration  begin  to  distort  the  results.  We
are now at the point where laboratory conditions are inhibiting further advances in
some of the most promising areas of research for the 21st century.

The $28 million proposed in the FY 2008 budget will leverage previously proposed
funds  ($10.1  million)  in  the  FY  2007  budget  to  construct  state-of-the-art  laboratory
space  that  will  meet  the  stringent  environmental  conditions  required  for  21st  cen-
tury  scientific  advances.  An  additional  $38.1  million  will  be  needed  in  FY  2009  to
complete  the  project.  With  a  total  cost  of  $76.2  million,  the  Building  1  Extension
is  the  most  cost-effective  approach  to  enabling  world-class  measurement  science  in
support of some of the country’s most important economic sectors.

NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) Expansion and Reliability Improvements

(+$19 million)

The NCNR is widely regarded as the most scientifically-productive and cost-effec-
tive  neutron  facility  in  the  U.S.,  and  serves  more  scientists  and  engineers  than  all
other  U.S.  facilities  combined.  Neutron  scattering  techniques,  in  which  beams  of
neutrons are used as probes to see the structure and movements of materials at the
smallest  scales  are  critical  in  a  wide  range  of  applications  that  will  define  the  21st
century  including  nanotechnology,  alternative  energies,  and  understanding  the
structure  of  biological  molecules.  Because  of  the  unique  properties  of  neutrons  for
probing materials and their applications to some of the most advanced technologies,
a  significant  shortage  of  neutron  beam  capacity  and  capability  exists  in  the  U.S.  to
satisfy the demands of industry and academia.

This  initiative  begun  in  FY  2007  is  the  second-year  of  a  planned  five-year  pro-
gram  to  expand  significantly  the  capacity  and  capabilities  of  the  NCNR.  The  pro-
gram  includes  the  development  of  a  new  neutron  cold  source  together  with  a  new
hall  to  house  the  guide  tube,  modernization  of  the  control  system,  and  five  new
world-class  neutron  instruments.  The  specific  FY  2008  funding  will  complete  con-
struction of the new guide hall.

Industrial Technology Services
Hollings  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  (MEP)  ($46.3  million—no  change

from FY 2007 President’s request; -$58.3 million from H.J. Res. 20)

The  MEP  program  is  a  partnership  between  the  Federal  Government  and  local
officials to provide assistance to small and medium-sized manufacturers around the
country.  Surveys  taken  of  companies  one  year  after  receiving  MEP  assistance  indi-
cate a significant financial benefit accrued to the individual company.

The  Federal  Government  is  an  important  partner  in  the  MEP  program.  Specifi-

• Ensures that small manufacturers remain the focus of the effort.

The  above  federal  role  can  be  accomplished  within  the  requested  budget.  The  re-
duction  of  federal  funds  to  the  local  centers  may  have  to  be  compensated  through
a combination of increased fees derived from the benefits accrued by individual com-
panies and cost-savings in the operations of the centers.

Advanced  Technology  Program  (ATP)  ($0—no  change  from  FY  2007  President’s  re-

quest)

No funds for ATP are requested in the President’s FY 2008 budget. The FY 2006
enacted  budget  and  the  109th  Congress’  House  mark  and  Senate  Appropriations
Committee  mark  were  consistent  with  the  phase-out  of  the  ATP  program.  The  last
new awards were made in 2004 and sufficient funds were available in the carryover
to complete all awards and provide government oversight.

The  FY  2007  Joint  Resolution  (H.J.  Res.  20)  recently  passed  by  the  House  in-
cluded  funding  for  the  ATP  program.  If  enacted,  NIST  will  work  with  Congress  to
ensure  the  funds  are  executed  in  the  most  effective  manner  to  promote  U.S.  indus-
try’s competitiveness.
Summary

Measurements  and  standards  are  the  bedrock  upon  which  any  economy  stands.
Our founding fathers recognized this. The Constitution assigns the Federal Govern-
ment  responsibility  to  both  issue  money  and  to  ‘‘fix  the  standards  of  weights  and
measures.’’ The two are actually more similar than they might seem at first glance.
All economic transactions rest fundamentally on trust—trust between two parties
that a given amount of something is worth a given amount of something else. Help-
ing  to  create  that  trust  for  innovative  new  technologies  is  the  common  theme  that
runs  through  all  of  NIST’s  proposed  FY  2008  research  initiatives.  Each  helps  build
a  missing  or  inadequate  measurement  base—a  rigorous,  accepted  way  of  quan-
titatively describing something—that improves confidence in scientific results or im-
proves  the  quality,  reliability  or  safety  of  innovative  products.  Recent  NIST  meas-
urements  and  standards  research  have  enabled  innovations  now  embedded  in  the
iPod, body armor currently saving the lives of domestic law enforcement officers and
our service men and women overseas, and in diagnostic screening devices for cancer
patients  making  their  treatment  more  targeted  and  accurate.  The  results  of  NIST
research can be found in virtually every manufacturing and service industry.

For nearly 106 years, NIST research has been critical to our nation’s current and
future competitiveness. The increased funding in the President’s FY 2008 budget for
the  NIST  core  will  directly  support  technological  advances  in  broad  sectors  of  the
economy  that  will  quite  literally  define  the  21st  century—as  well  as  improve  the
safety and quality of life for all our citizens.

BIOGRAPHY FOR WILLIAM JEFFREY

Dr. William Jeffrey is the 13th Director of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology  (NIST),  sworn  into  the  office  on  July  26,  2005.  He  was  nominated  by
President  Bush  on  May  25,  2005,  and  confirmed  by  the  U.S.  Senate  on  July  22,
2005.

As Director of NIST, Dr. Jeffrey oversees an array of programs that promote U.S.
innovation  and  industrial  competitiveness  by  advancing  measurement  science,
standards,  and  technology  in  ways  that  enhance  economic  security  and  improve
quality of life. Operating in fiscal year 2006 on a budget of about $930 million, NIST
is  headquartered  in  Gaithersburg,  Md.,  and  has  additional  laboratories  in  Boulder,
Colo. NIST also jointly operates research organizations in four locations, which sup-
port  world-class  physics,  cutting-edge  biotechnology,  and  environmental  research.
NIST  employs  about  2,800  scientists,  engineers,  technicians,  and  support  personnel
and  has  extensive  cooperative  research  programs  with  industry,  academia,  and
other government agencies. Its staff is augmented by about 2,500 associates and vis-
iting researchers from industry and universities.

Dr. Jeffrey has been involved in federal science and technology programs and pol-
icy  since  1988.  Previous  to  his  appointment  to  NIST  he  served  as  Senior  Director
for Homeland and National Security and the Assistant Director for Space and Aero-
nautics at the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) within the Executive
Office of the President. Earlier, he was the Deputy Director for the Advanced Tech-
nology Office and Chief Scientist for the Tactical Technology Office with the Defense
Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA).  While  at  DARPA,  Dr.  Jeffrey  ad-
vanced  research  programs  in  communications,  computer  network  security,  novel
sensor development, and space operations.

Prior  to  joining  DARPA,  Dr.  Jeffrey  was  the  Assistant  Deputy  for  Technology  at
the  Defense  Airborne  Reconnaissance  Office,  where  he  supervised  sensor  develop-
ment for the Predator and Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and the develop-
ment of common standards that allow for cross-service and cross-agency transfer of
imagery and intelligence products. He also spent several years working at the Insti-
tute  for  Defense  Analyses  performing  technical  analyses  in  support  of  the  Depart-
ment of Defense.

Dr.  Jeffrey  received  his  Ph.D.  in  astronomy  from  Harvard  University  and  his

B.Sc. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  R.  STANLEY  WILLIAMS,  SENIOR  HP  FEL-
LOW IN QUANTUM SCIENCE RESEARCH, HEWLETT-PACKARD
CORPORATION
Dr.  WILLIAMS.  Chairman  Wu  and  Representative  Gingrey,  I
thank you for this opportunity to testify before you today on behalf
of  ASTRA,  the  Alliance  for  Science  and  Technology  Research  in
America.

Benjamin  Franklin,  often  called  the  ‘‘first  American,’’  was  also
the  first  American  scientist.  He  understood  that  science  was  not
just a pastime to demonstrate wealth or satisfy curiosity, but rath-
er a force that could generate wealth and be utilized for the public
good.  Franklin  performed  careful  experiments  to  characterize  elec-
trical  phenomena.  He  was  the  first  to  understand  the  nature  of
electrical  conduction  and  he  utilized  his  knowledge  to  invent  the
lightning  rod,  which  was  one  of  the  most  important  technical  ad-
vances  of  his  day.  Thus,  Franklin  created  the  distinctly  American
paradigm  for  technological  innovation:  If  you  measure  something
that  has  never  been  quantified  before,  you  can  discover  something
that  has  never  been  known  before,  which  enables  you  to  invent
something,  which  has  never  existed  before.  He  said,  ‘‘An  invest-
ment in knowledge always pays the best interest.’’

Over a period of nearly two centuries, American technological in-
novation has been the primary source of our wealth in this country.
ASTRA  was  founded  in  2000  to  work  on  behalf  of  and  provide  a
more  effective  voice  for  industry,  academia,  and  professional  asso-
ciations  involved  in  the  technology  enterprise.  Our  members  rep-
resent  an  underlying  constituency  of  more  than  2.4  million  sci-
entists  and  engineers  in  the  United  States  who  work  every  day  to
build a stronger America.

The focus of today’s testimony is NIST. And I gratefully acknowl-
edge the extensive collaborations that Hewlett-Packard, in general,
and my research group, in particular, have enjoyed with NIST sci-
entists. ASTRA strongly endorses the doubling of the NIST budget
because of its unique role and strategic importance to our country’s
research ecosystem.

The mission of NIST is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial
competitiveness by advancing metrology, standards, and technology
to  enhance  economic  security  and  improve  our  quality  of  life.  As  a
government  agency,  it  does  so  objectively  without  favor  or  advan-
tage  to  any  preferred  technology  or  enterprise.  Unfortunately,  the
essential role NIST plays in enabling the competitiveness of Amer-
ican industry has often been under-recognized.

Among  other  activities,  NIST  develops  and  improves  measure-
ment technologies, supplies critical reference standards used across
industries  to  calibrate  their  products  and  services,  and  from  my
point,  most  importantly,  provides  verified  and  reliable  technical
data  to  the  scientific  community.  NIST  scientists  act  as  a  critical
check  on  the  often  conflicting  and  confusing  claims  coming  out  of
various  research  labs.  I  consider  these  activities  to  be  the  core  of
the  NIST  mission  and  the  keystone  for  technological  innovation.
Before  we  can  discover  and  invent  today,  we  must  measure  with
extraordinary precision and trust the results.

I compliment NIST on the extent of its efforts to understand and
respond to the needs of industry and on the quality of its oversight
programs. However, it is my observation that the scientific staff at
NIST  are  now  overwhelmed  by  their  responsibilities.  The  number
of  new  program  areas  that  have  been  added  to  the  NIST  portfolio
has really exceeded their funding increases. This mission creep has
stretched  the  staff  and  slowed  their  ability  to  respond.  In  some
cases,  it  has  taken  several  years  to  complete  key  measurements,
which can make them less valuable in an era of rapid technological
change.

In  order  to  respond  to  new  opportunities,  NIST  scientists  often
have  to  compete  for  grant  funding  from  other  federal  agencies.
While  such  activities  can  meet  important  governmental  needs,  the
need for such activities should be an exception.

ASTRA strongly recommends that all current NIST missions and
programs,  including  the  newly-created  NIST  Center  for  Nanoscale
Science  and  Technology,  the  ATP  and  the  MEP  should  be  ade-
quately funded and supported by Congress and the Administration
under  the  doubling  initiative.  These  programs  are  sound  invest-
ments  with  high  potential  returns  for  American  taxpayers.  We
should  resist  the  temptation  of  adding  new  responsibilities,  espe-
cially unfunded ones in 2008 and the future until we can be certain
that  the  current  missions  will  be  adequately  served.  An  important
issue to realize here is that during the next five years, the amount
of  scientific  information  that  we  will  accumulate  will  double.  In
other words, we will learn as much about science over the next five
years  as  we  have  over  all  of  human  history.  So  we  somehow  need
to  keep  up  with  this  information  glut  and  make  it  something  that
we can internalize and understand and utilize.

NIST  must  attract  and  hire  a  continuous  stream  of  world-class
researchers  in  order  to  carry  out  its  mission.  The  three  Nobel
Prizes  awarded  to  NIST  staff  in  the  past  years  demonstrate  the
quality  of  the  current  staff  and  have  brought  overdue  recognition
to  NIST.  However,  in  my  view,  the  current  climate  at  NIST  is
strained with the technical staff having to work harder and longer
to accomplish less. The budget doubling should be accomplished in
a  manner  that  the  research,  support,  and  infrastructure  is  im-
proved  to  make  the  current  staff  more  flexible  and  productive,
which  will,  in  turn,  attract  new  scientific  stars  to  the  NIST  staff.
In summary, ASTRA believes that NIST must maintain its world
leadership  in  metrology  and  understanding  the  infrastructure  of
emerging  technologies  in  order  for  the  United  States  to  remain
technologically  and  economically  competitive.  Nanotechnology,  I

think, is an ideal area of focus because of the tremendous potential
of  economic  rewards  and  the  acute  demand  it  places  on  metrology.
NIST  holds  the  key  to  American  technological  innovation  and
competitiveness.  Today,  more  than  ever,  exquisite  measurement  is
necessary for discovery and invention.

I  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  speak  to  you  today  on  these

important issues.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Williams follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF R. STANLEY WILLIAMS

Chairman  Wu,  Representative  Gingrey  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  House
Subcommittee  on  Technology  and  Innovation;  I  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to
testify  before  you  today  on  behalf  of  ASTRA,  the  Alliance  for  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Research  in  America.  My  name  is  Stan  Williams,  and  I  am  a  Hewlett-Pack-
ard  Senior  Fellow  and  the  founding  Director  of  H–P’s  Quantum  Science  Research
Group  in  Palo  Alto,  California.  Our  laboratory  was  created  in  1995  at  the  behest
of  David  Packard  to  prepare  HP  for  the  major  challenges  and  opportunities  ahead
in electronic device technology as feature sizes continue to shrink to the nanometer
scale, where quantum mechanics dominates the behavior of matter.

I. Background

Benjamin  Franklin  has  been  called  by  many  people  the  ‘‘first  American.’’  He  was
also  the  first  American  scientist  of  world  renown.  Franklin  understood  that  science
was not just a pastime to demonstrate wealth or satisfy curiosity, but rather a force
that could generate wealth and be utilized for the public good. He performed careful
experiments  to  characterize  electrical  phenomena:  he  was  the  first  to  understand
the nature of electrical conduction and he utilized his knowledge to invent the light-
ning rod. Thus, Franklin created the distinctly American paradigm for technological
innovation:  If  you  measure  something  that  has  never  been  quantified  before,  you
can discover something that has never been known before, which enables you to in-
vent something that has never existed before. He was also prescient about the fund-
ing of research when he said ‘‘An investment in knowledge always pays the best in-
terest.’’

Over  a  period  of  two  centuries,  technological  innovation  became  the  goose  that
laid  the  golden  eggs  for  American  society.  Inventions  such  as  the  telephone,  light
bulb,  radio,  phonograph,  vacuum  tube,  transistor,  laser,  and  integrated  circuit,
among many others, have created huge industries that employ our citizens, improve
our lives, and supply a large fraction of the tax dollars collected by the U.S. Govern-
ment.

However,  toward  the  end  of  the  last  century,  we  started  to  become  complacent
and neglectful. Our wonderful goose was slowly being starved, and the consequences
of  that  were  alarming  indeed.  This  situation  brought  scientists  like  me  to  Wash-
ington in a new role—rather than trying to obtain a research grant, we had to learn
to  represent  the  entire  scientific  enterprise  in  the  annual  budgetary  process  so  fa-
miliar to you but foreign to us.

ASTRA  was  founded  in  2000  to  work  on  behalf  of,  and  provide  a  more  effective
voice for, industry, academe, and professional and trade associations involved in the
technology  enterprise.  Our  members,  in  turn,  represent  an  underlying  constituency
of more than 2.4 million scientists and engineers in the United States. We have had
the  pleasure  of  working  with  many  of  you  on  bipartisan  efforts  over  the  years,  and
together  we  have  accomplished  a  great  deal.  But  as  you  know,  this  work  is  never
done, and there have been a significant number of emergencies and distractions that
have prevented us from reaching our goals.

We must succeed in revitalizing the math, physical science and engineering infra-
structure  of  the  United  States.  The  cost  of  failure  is  too  grim  to  contemplate.  One
necessary component of this revitalization is the doubling of the budgets of the Na-
tional  Science  Foundation,  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Basic  Energy
Sciences,  Department  of  Defense  6.1  research  and  the  National  Institute  of  Stand-
ards  and  Technology,  preferably  on  a  five-year  time  frame.  We  must  do  this  before
we lose an entire generation of American scientists and engineers and become com-
pletely reliant on other countries for our technology. I have appended several graphs
to my presentation to illustrate the situation we face today, especially in the context
of global competition.

The  primary  focus  of  today’s  testimony  is  NIST.  I  gratefully  acknowledge  the  ex-
tensive collaborations that HP in general, and my research group in particular, have
enjoyed with NIST scientists over the years, and the crucial contributions they have
made  to  American  industry.  ASTRA  has  paid  special  attention  to  NIST  because  of
its unique role and strategic importance to our country’s research ‘‘ecosystem.’’
II. NIST in Context

The  mission  of  NIST  is  ‘‘To  promote  U.S.  innovation  and  industrial  competitive-
ness  by  advancing  measurement  science  (or  metrology),  standards,  and  technology
in  ways  that  enhance  economic  security  and  improve  our  quality  of  life.’’  As  a  gov-
ernment  agency,  it  does  so  objectively,  without  favor  or  advantage  to  any  preferred
technology  or  enterprise.  NIST  has  been  described  before  this  committee—by  rep-
resentatives  of  both  Republican  and  Democratic  Administrations—as  the  ‘‘crown

25

jewel of the federal laboratories,’’ since it is recognized as the broadest and strongest
national  metrology  institution  in  the  world.  Unfortunately,  the  essential  role  NIST
plays  in  enabling  the  competitiveness  of  American  industry  has  often  been  under-
recognized.[1]

Among  other  activities,  NIST  develops  and  improves  measurement  technologies,
supplies  critical  reference  standards  used  across  industries  to  calibrate  their  prod-
ucts  and  services,  and  provides  verified  and  reliable  technical  data  to  the  scientific
community.  NIST  scientists  act  as  a  critical  check  on  the  often  conflicting  claims
coming  out  of  various  research  labs  on  the  discovery  of  new  phenomena.  In  our
group  at  HP,  we  consider  it  to  be  the  ultimate  validation  of  our  claims  when  NIST
scientists  reproduce  our  experimental  results.  We  are  eager  to  collaborate  with
NIST  to  ensure  our  measurements  are  as  good  as  they  can  be.  These  activities  are
the keystone for technological innovation—before we can discover and invent today,
we must measure with extraordinary precision and trust the results.

Metrology  is  also  an  essential  enabler  of  standards,  especially  those  standards
that describe the properties and performance of products. A customer can make wise
choices among competing products only when the specifications of those products are
determined accurately, using the same or consistent methods.[2]
III. The Need for Additional Resources and Avoiding Mission Creep

I would like, first of all, to compliment NIST on the extent of its efforts to under-
stand  and  respond  to  the  needs  of  its  industrial  constituency  and  on  the  quality  of
its  oversight  programs.  These  efforts  start  at  the  highest  levels  of  NIST  manage-
ment,  with  the  statutory  (15  U.S.C.  278)  NIST  Visiting  Committee  on  Advanced
Technology  (VCAT).  VCAT  members  are  high  level  executives  and  managers,  two-
thirds of whom must, by law, represent U.S. industry. They advise the NIST Direc-
tor on broad policy issues and report their views to the Secretary of Commerce and
Congress.

For  more  detailed  advice,  NIST  contracts  with  the  National  Research  Council
(NRC) to review, annually and in depth, the technical direction of its individual sci-
entific programs. The results of this review are reported to NIST staff at all levels,
and  are  publicly  available  through  the  NRC.  And  as  in  many  large  organizations,
each organizational unit of NIST develops its own strategic and tactical plans.

Recently  there  has  been  a  noteworthy  effort  at  NIST  to  structure  its  knowledge
of  industrial  measurement  needs.  The  first  result  was  a  special  report  issued  last
year  called  ‘‘An  Assessment  of  the  United  States  Measurement  System:  Addressing
Measurement  Barriers  to  Accelerate  Innovation.’’  NIST  should  be  commended  for
this  proactive  effort  to  understand  measurement  needs  and  to  promote  greater  dia-
log with industry.

All  this  said,  it  is  my  observation  that  the  scientific  staff  at  NIST  are  now  over-
whelmed by the volume of work that they face. In the past, the number of new pro-
grams and responsibilities that have been added to the NIST portfolio has dramati-
cally over-reached their funding increases. This mission creep has stretched the staff
very thin, and has made their response time quite long.[3]

In  some  cases,  it  has  taken  several  years  to  complete  key  measurements,  which
can make them ineffectual in an era in which a new technology can become obsolete
in  a  single  year.  Some  projects  have  taken  so  long  they  have  not  survived  reorga-
nizations or staff reassignments. In order to respond to new opportunities, NIST sci-
entists  often  have  to  compete  for  grant  funding  from  other  government  agencies,
which creates even more demands on their time.

According  to  the  NIST  web  site,  in  FY  2006,  roughly  25  percent  of  the  approxi-
mately $520 million NIST expended for Scientific and Technical Research and Serv-
ices  was  from  such  contracts.  While  these  activities  can  meet  important  govern-
mental needs, they diminish the Institute’s flexibility in responding to the industrial
priorities  it  identifies.  Dependence  on  such  short-term  funding  also  diminishes  the
opportunity to plan long term programs of broader benefit.

Thus, ASTRA strongly recommends that all current NIST missions and programs,
including the newly created NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, the
Advanced  Technology  Program  and  the  Hollings  Manufacturing  Extension  Partner-
ship  (MEP)  Program,  should  be  adequately  funded  and  supported  by  Congress  and
the  Administration  under  the  ‘‘doubling’’  initiative.  These  programs  are  sound  in-
vestments  with  high  potential  returns  for  American  taxpayers,  and  should  be  seen
in  the  context  of  managing  a  vital  portfolio  of  assets  and  talents  for  the  country’s
economic and security needs. We must resist the temptation of adding any new pro-
grams in 2008 to justify the increase in funding until we know that current missions
are adequately served.

IV. Construction and Facilities

I  am  pleased  to  note  that  $94  million  of  the  NIST  budget  proposal  for  FY  2008
is  devoted  to  ‘‘Construction  and  Research  Facilities,’’  roughly  half  for  maintenance
and  repairs  and  the  remainder  for  new  construction.  Most  of  the  facilities  on  the
NIST Gaithersburg campus date from the 1960’s and all of the facilities on the Boul-
der campus date from the 1950’s.

All  too  often,  maintenance  and  repairs  are  deferred  year  after  year  in  difficult
budget times, leading to buildings and facilities that are obsolete. When most of the
current  buildings  were  dedicated,  nobody  anticipated  the  manipulation  of  matter
atom-by-atom  or  metering  of  light  photon-by-photon.  Such  research  requires  facili-
ties  with  extreme  mechanical  and  thermal  stability.  The  proposed  state-of-the-art
facilities will enable NIST to meet these and other emerging industrial needs.
V. NIST Involvement with Industry Must be Maintained and Expanded

Something  that  makes  NIST  exceptional  among  federal  laboratories  is  the  extent
of  involvement  by  NIST  staff  in  industry  activities  and  industrial  researchers  in
NIST.  Historically,  NIST  management  has  encouraged  staff  at  all  levels  to  partici-
pate  in  technical  conferences  and  the  activities  of  professional  societies  and  trade
associations,  and  through  these  activities  to  become  well  informed  about  industrial
trends and measurement needs. Even more importantly, it empowers staff to act on
what  they  learn,  providing  channels  through  which  any  professional  staff  member
can  propose  and  advocate  new  projects.  This  culture  of  gathering  information  and
acting on it is effective, and it is essential that it be maintained.

An  example  of  NIST  collaboration  with  industry  is  its  participation  in  the  Inter-
national  Technology  Roadmap  for  Semiconductors.  The  roadmap  process  brings  to-
gether  over  800  experts  from  around  the  world  to  identify  technical  barriers  that
would prevent continued advances in semiconductor technology. Almost three quar-
ters of the roadmap participants are from industry, with the remainder from univer-
sities,  research  institutes  and  consortia,  and  from  government.  NIST  co-chairs  and
has  four  scientists  on  the  Metrology  technical  working  group,  and  also  has  experts
on the Emerging Research Devices and Materials, Assembly and Packaging, Factory
Integration, and RF for Wireless working groups. Through this interaction, NIST is
very  familiar  with  the  industry’s  needs  and  can  direct  internal  NIST  metrology  re-
search  to  address  these  challenges.  NIST  should  continue  to  host  user  facilities  for
both  academic  researchers  and  industry.  Areas  like  the  neutron  facility  for  mate-
rials testing and the new nano metrology laboratory should be user friendly without
a lot of bureaucratic interference.
VI. Future NIST Staffing and Workforce Development

NIST  must  attract  and  hire  a  continuous  stream  of  world-class  researchers  in
order to carry out its mission and to maintain its position as the premier metrology
institute  in  the  world.  The  three  Nobel  prizes  awarded  to  NIST  staff  in  the  past
ten  years  demonstrate  the  quality  of  the  current  staff,  and  have  brought  overdue
recognition  to  NIST.  However,  the  current  climate  at  NIST  is  strained,  with  the
technical staff having to work harder and longer to accomplish less. The budget dou-
bling should be accomplished in a manner that the research support and infrastruc-
ture  is  improved  to  make  the  staff  more  flexible  and  productive,  rather  than  erect-
ing barriers and increasing red tape.
VII. Conclusion

In summary, ASTRA would like to see NIST maintain its world leadership in re-
searching and understanding the infrastructure of emerging technologies. Increased
funding and proper planning executed now will give our country vital resources that
it will need to remain a major competitive force in the world economy.

The range of activities at NIST is quite broad and it should remain so. The exam-
ple of nanotechnology is an ideal area to focus on because of the tremendous poten-
tial  it  has  for  the  U.S.  to  be  very  competitive  in  a  new  field  and  the  extreme  de-
mands  it  places  on  metrology.  However,  we  have  to  ensure  that  NIST  can  perform
its current responsibilities before tacking on any more.

I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  to  you  today  on  these  important  issues.

Finally,  there  will  always  be  debate  in  the  science  and  engineering  community
over  the  details  of  how  NIST  should  best  use  additional  resource.  In  any  case,
ASTRA recognizes the need for increased support at NIST and is pleased that Con-
gress and the Administration have recognized the importance of metrology. And we
fervently hope that Congress will be able to provide NIST with the funds requested
as we embark upon this exciting journey.

NIST  holds  the  key  to  American  technological  innovation  and  competitiveness—

measurement is necessary discovery and invention.

1. Example of How Advances in Metrology Boost U.S. Competitiveness

As  conventional  integrated  electronics  continue  to  shrink,  our  ability  to  continue
to increase the performance of the circuits on each chip is on a collision course with
the  laws  of  physics.  A  good  example  of  the  importance  of  advances  in  the  science
of  metrology  is  offered  by  the  recent  HP  announcement  of  research  that  could  lead
to integrated circuits with eight times the logic density of current chips without hav-
ing  to  shrink  the  transistors  on  the  circuit.  In  a  paper  that  I  published  with  Greg
Snider in the January 24 issue of Nanotechnology, a publication of the British Insti-
tute of Physics, we documented how a nanoscale crossbar switch structure could be
layered on top of a conventional layer of transistors to create significantly more ca-
pable  field  programmable  gate  arrays  (FPGAs).  A  FPGA  is  a  type  of  semiconductor
chip that can be adapted by end-users for specific applications, and is used in a wide
range  of  industries,  including  communications,  automotive  and  consumer  elec-
tronics.

To actually produce this chip in the lab, and then to introduce it into the commer-
cial  marketplace  requires  numerous  measurements,  including  the  width  and  align-
ment  of  the  crossbars,  the  electrical  characteristics  of  the  connection  between  the
crossbar  and  the  conventional  semiconductor  device,  and  the  presence  of  defects  in
the crossbar and substrate material. In our paper, we presented a chip model using
15-nanometer-wide  crossbar  wires  which  could  be  technologically  viable  by  2010,
and  a  model  based  on  4.5-nanometer-wide  crossbar  wires,  which  could  be  ready  by
2020.  To  shrink  the  crossbars  and  connect  them  to  the  semiconductor  devices  will
require  improvements  in  the  accuracy  of  all  of  the  required  measurements.  NIST
metrology research is absolutely essential if we are to continue to improve our elec-
tronic  circuits  at  the  traditional  rates  that  have  made  America  the  leader  in  this
technology.
2. Semiconductor Industry of Association Written Testimony for this Hear-

ing
Written testimony submitted to this hearing by the Semiconductor Industry Asso-
ciation, an ASTRA Founding Member, discusses other measurements needed to con-
tinue  to  increase  the  circuit  density  on  each  semiconductor  chip,  the  productivity
and  competitiveness  effects  resulting  from  these  advances,  the  industry-university-
government  collaboration  through  the  Nanoelectronics  Research  Initiative  to  find  a
new  technology  to  replace  our  current  semiconductor  logic  switch,  and  NIST’s  role
in keeping U.S. leadership in this area.
3. Concern About NIST Workforce Preparedness and New Missions

In  my  capacity  representing  ASTRA  (and  not  H–P),  I  would  like  to  express  con-
cern about NIST moving into fields in which they have no history or prior expertise
(e.g., climate science and geophysics), and which are arguably outside of NIST’s mis-
sion in support of American industry. The fact that current NIST staff are stretched
too thin might exacerbate the problem. NIST reliance on contract workers and guest
researchers  can  be  a  two-edged  sword.  Such  reliance  may  enable  ‘‘scalability’’  for
project  needs,  but  also  create  an  impermanence  and  ad  hoc  nature  to  NIST  as  an
institution. Currently, contract worker and guest researcher numbers are almost as
large as the permanent S&T staff.

According  to  public  reports,  NIST  currently  has  a  staff  of  about  2,800—roughly
half  of  whom  are  professionals  in  science  and  technology.  In  addition,  about  1,200
guest researchers and contractors work at NIST. Though the guests and contractors
are  professionals  who  bring  creativity  and  energy  to  the  Institute,  they  are  unable
to  participate  in  inherently  governmental  functions,  such  as  measurement  services
performed for the public.

Neither  can  they  participate  in  research  under  Cooperative  R&D  Agreements
(CRADAs) with private sector collaborators, an important vehicle by which NIST re-
search is transferred to industry.

In  terms  of  our  concern  about  ‘‘mission  creep,’’  all  of  which  are  laudable  goals,
ASTRA  cites  the  agency’s  own  Web  Site  which  identifies  five  new  initiatives  which
have  been  added  to  the  Fiscal  Year  2008  Budget  Request  as  well  as  12  Initiatives
described in the FY 2007 Budget. They are:
Major components of the ’08 budget request include five new initiatives in
the following areas:

BIOGRAPHY FOR R. STANLEY WILLIAMS

R. Stanley Williams is an HP Senior Fellow at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories and
founding  Director  (since  1995)  of  the  HP  Quantum  Science  Research  (QSR)  group,
which  currently  has  over  50  scientists  and  engineers  working  in  areas  of  funda-
mental physical sciences. There are five active HP Senior Fellows out of a total tech-
nical  staff  of  ∼40,000  at  Hewlett-Packard.  The  QSR  was  established  to  prepare  HP
for  the  major  challenges  and  opportunities  ahead  in  electronic,  photonic  and  me-
chanical  device  technology  as  features  continue  to  shrink  to  the  nanometer  size
scale, where quantum mechanics becomes important.

He  received  a  B.A.  degree  in  Chemical  Physics  in  1974  from  Rice  University  and
his  Ph.D.  in  Physical  Chemistry  from  U.  C.  Berkeley  in  1978.  He  was  a  Member
of  Technical  Staff  at  AT&T  Bell  Labs  from  1978–80  and  a  faculty  member  (Assist-
ant,  Associate  and  Full  Professor)  of  the  Chemistry  Department  at  UCLA  from
1980–1995. His primary scientific research during the past thirty years has been in
the areas of solid-state chemistry and physics, and their applications to technology.
This  has  evolved  into  the  areas  of  nanostructures  and  chemically-assembled  mate-
rials, with an emphasis on the thermodynamics of size and shape.

Most  recently,  he  has  examined  the  fundamental  limits  of  information  and  com-
puting,  which  has  led  to  his  current  research  in  nano-electronics  and  nano-
photonics.  He  has  received  awards  for  business,  scientific  and  academic  achieve-
ment,  including  the  2004  Joel  Birnbaum  Prize  (the  highest  internal  HP  award  for
research),  the  2003  Herman  Bloch  Medal  for  Industrial  Research,  the  2000  Julius
Springer  Award  for  Applied  Physics,  the  2000  Feynman  Prize  in  Nanotechnology,
the Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award and the Sloan Foundation Fellowship.

He  was  named  to  the  inaugural  Scientific  American  50  Top  Technology  leaders
in 2002 and then again in 2005 (the first to be so named twice), and the molecular
electronics program he leads was named the Technology of the Year for 2002 by In-
dustry Week magazine.

In  2005,  the  U.S.  patent  collection  that  he  has  assembled  at  HP  was  named  the
world’s top nanotechnology intellectual property portfolio by Small Times magazine,
and  the  Chinese  Academy  of  Science  voted  the  crossbar  latch  as  the  number  three
scientific breakthrough of the year (behind the Cassini and Deep Impact space mis-
sions).  He  was  a  co-organizer  and  co-editor  of  the  workshop  and  book  ‘‘Vision  for
Nanotechnology  in  the  21st  Century,’’  respectively,  that  led  to  the  establishment  of
the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative in 2000.

He  has  been  awarded  fifty-two  U.S.  patents  with  more  than  forty  more  pending,
he has published over 280 papers in reviewed scientific journals, and he has written
several general articles for technical, business and general interest publications (in-
cluding an article in the Nov. 2005 issue of Scientific American). One of his patents
was  named  as  one  of  five  that  will  ‘‘transform  business  and  technology’’  by  MIT’s
Technology Review in 2000.

Williams has presented hundreds of invited plenary, keynote and named lectures
at international scientific, technical and business events, including the 2003 Joseph
Franklin Lecture at Rice University, the 2004 Debye Lectures at Cornell University,
the  2004  Herman  Bloch  Lecture  at  the  University  of  Chicago,  and  the  2005
Carreker Engineering Lecture at Georgia Tech.

Chairman WU. Thank you, Dr. Williams.
Mr. Borrus.

STATEMENT OF MR. MICHAEL BORRUS, GENERAL PARTNER,

X/SEED CAPITAL

Mr.  BORRUS.  Mr.  Chairman,  distinguished  Members  of  the  Con-
gress,  and  staff  members,  for  reasons  I  will  describe  in  a  moment,
I  created  X/Seed  to  focus  on  a  sorely-neglected  part  of  early-stage
capital markets, the so-called seed stage, which is typically the first
money raised by entrepreneurs to start a new business to begin to
transition an idea, a rudimentary technology, out of the laboratory
toward  the  commercial  marketplace.  My  typical  investment  in-
volves two entrepreneurs and ten PowerPoint slides, and not much
else.

I  also  want  to  call  the  Committee’s  attention  to  several  other
parts of my background, because they are relevant to my testimony
today.

Prior  to  entering  the  venture  capital  industry,  I  spent  a  little
over  half  a  decade  as  a  start-up  entrepreneur.  And  for  over  a  dec-
ade  before  that,  I  was  at  UC–Berkeley  on  the  engineering  faculty
where my work focused on emerging new technologies, the commer-
cialization of innovation, and related policy.

My testimony is based on my experience in all of those domains:
studying, doing, and now investing in high-risk, early technological
innovation.

As  I  have  been  asked  to  comment  on  the  ATP  program,  I  would
also  call  the  Committee’s  attention  to  the  fact  that  I  currently
serve  on  the  external  industry  Advisory  Committee  to  ATP,  and  I
previously  served  on  the  National  Academy’s  Steering  Committee
on  Government  and  Industry  Partnerships,  which  issued  two  very
detailed  analysis  reports  on  the  ATP  program  in  1999  and  then
again in 2001.

I have three simple points to make. I will make them briefly, and

they all lead to one conclusion.

First,  significant  changes  over  the  last  15  years  in  early-stage
capital markets in the United States create, in my view, an urgent
need  for  the  ATP  to  be  continued  and  for  it  to  be  substantially
funded so that it can run new competitions.

The most significant change in those markets is this: as the ven-
ture capital has grown and matured, the bulk of that industry has
moved  away  from  seed-stage  investing  to  invest  later  in  the  life
cycle of a start-up. When large amounts of capital can be efficiently
deployed  to  permit  companies  to  expand  later  on,  at  the  point  in
which  companies  already  have  products  developed  typically  may
actually  have  initial  sales.  That  drift-away  from  early-stage  fund-
ing  has  created  a  paradox.  There  is  plenty  of  capital  available  to
expand company operations, but there is too little capital available
at  the  riskiest  moment  in  a  start-up’s  life,  at  the  very  beginning
when  only  an  idea,  a  concept,  or  a  rudimentary  technology  exists
and  needs  to  be  transitioned  out  of  the  lab,  across  the  so-called
‘‘valley  of  death,’’  and  toward  the  commercial  marketplace.  Very
few  organized  financing  mechanisms  of  sufficient  scale  exist  to  ad-
dress  that  problem.  That,  frankly,  is  why  X/Seed  Capital  exists.
And  that,  frankly,  is  also  ATP’s  historical  sweet  spot,  and  there  is
plenty of room for both of us.

That leads to my next point: why ATP?
ATP is, quite likely, the most intensively studied, rigorously scru-
tinized,  and  carefully  assessed  U.S.  technology  program  of  the  last
50  years  at  least.  As  the  National  Academy’s  reviews  concluded,
‘‘ATP  is  an  extremely  well-run  program  that  works  and  works
well.’’  Several  of  its  program  features,  notably  its  rigorous  peer-re-
viewed,  pork-free,  merit-based  competitions,  its  emphasis  on  cost
sharing,  its  rigorous  self-assessment,  and  its  measured  return  on
investment set the standard to which other federal technology pro-
grams ought to aspire, which leads to my third point.

As  the  Committee  knows,  as  a  nation,  we  face  a  series  of  major
challenges  to  which  continued  innovation  is  the  best  response.
These  include  the  need  to  move  to  carbon-neutral  alternative  en-

ergy technologies to maintain energy security for this country; esca-
lating health care costs driven by an aging population, one increas-
ingly  prone  to  chronic  long-term  illnesses,  like  diabetes;  the  com-
petitive rise as technological challengers of China, India, and other
advanced economies; and not least, the concomitant erosion of U.S.
technological  leadership  in  a  number  of  significant  areas.  In  ad-
dressing these challenges why reinvent the wheel? Leverage a pro-
gram that historically has helped to produce significant innovation
and that works and works well. Use ATP.

That leads to my conclusion.
As  a  result  of  those  arguments,  I  recommend  that  Congress
should reauthorize the ATP program, provide sufficient funding for
ATP to run several competitions, both general and specific competi-
tions focused in areas of acute need, like the search for carbon-neu-
tral  alternative  energy  technologies,  and  picking  up  on  your  open-
ing  remarks,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  believe  the  Committee  should  con-
sider  ways  that  ATP  might  be  stably  and  predictably  funded  over
a  long  enough  timeframe,  perhaps  a  decade,  to  have  a  significant
impact over time.

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL BORRUS

Distinguished Members of Congress:

I am Michael Borrus, founding General Partner of X/Seed Capital, a seed-focused
early  stage  venture  fund  based  in  California’s  Silicon  Valley.  I  have  been  asked  to
give  my  views  on  the  Advanced  Technology  Program  (ATP)  at  NIST,  a  program
that,  since  its  inception,  I  have  studied  closely—first  as  a  UC–Berkeley  faculty
member  focused  on  emerging  technologies,  technology  markets  and  policy,  then  as
an entrepreneur at an innovative start-up, and now as a very early-stage (so-called
‘‘seed-stage’’) venture capital investor focused on breakthrough innovation. Those ex-
periences  provide  an  informed  perspective  on  ATP  and  color  this  testimony.  You
should also note that I currently serve on the external industry Advisory Committee
to ATP and that I previously served on the National Academies’ steering Committee
on  Government-Industry  Partnerships,  chaired  by  Intel  founder  Gordon  Moore,
which issued two detailed evaluations of the ATP program in 1999 and 2001.1
Summary Conclusions

• Significant  changes  over  the  last  15  years  in  early  stage  capital  markets  in
the U.S.—in particular, an institutional drift away from very risky, seed stage
funding  by  private  venture  capital  investors—create  an  urgent  need  for  the
ATP  to  be  continued,  for  substantial  funding  to  be  restored  so  that  ATP  can
run new competitions, and for it to be stably funded for the foreseeable future.
• The  ATP  is  quite  likely  the  most  intensively  studied,  rigorously  scrutinized
and  carefully  assessed  U.S.  technology  program  of  the  past  50  years.  The
overwhelming consensus of such painstaking analysis, as of the prior NRC re-
views,  is  easily  summarized:  ATP  is  an  extremely  well  run  program  that
works and works very well.2 Indeed, ATP boosts several unique features that
permit it to set the standard among federal technology programs. It is, for ex-
ample,  the  only  federal  technology  program  that  actually  measures  its  eco-
nomic return to the Nation.3

• As  an  especially  well-run  federal  technology  program  targeted  at  areas  of
market failure and long-term national needs, a restored ATP has a vital role
to play and can be an essential element in the broader American response to
global  changes  in  technology  markets,  in  climate,  in  energy  security,  and  in
the U.S. competitive position in the global economy. Indeed, given the stakes,
a  restored  ATP  with  increased,  stable  funding  is  in  fact  the  most  prudent,
cautious  and  conservative  approach  for  it  risks  the  least:  By  contrast,  failing
to  fund  ATP  risks  sacrificing  American  opportunities  for  technical  advance
and the long-term economic growth and productivity gains it produces.
• For all of these reasons, I believe that Congress should re-authorize the ATP
program,  provide  sufficient  funding  for  ATP  to  run  several  competitions  fo-
cused around areas of acute need or promise in such areas as carbon-neutral
alternative  energies  and  energy  storage,  and  consider  ways  that  ATP  might
be  stably  and  predictably  funded  over  the  next  several  years  to  maximize  its
contribution to the Nation.

Let me now touch on key aspects of these summary points.

Seed financing

There  is  a  paradox  in  today’s  venture  capital  markets:  There  is  simultaneously
too much venture capital and too little. There is too much venture capital available
once  early  stage  risk  has  been  reduced  and  start-ups  seek  capital  for  expansion.
However,  there  is  too  little  venture  capital  available  for  the  riskiest,  de  novo  start-
up phase of a new venture’s life. That ‘seed’ stage—when an entrepreneur may have
a good idea, some scientific validation and at best only a rudimentary technology—
is  typically  when  potential  innovations  are  transitioned  out  of  the  lab  and  toward
the  commercial  marketplace.  It  is  when  they  must  navigate  the  gap  in  seed-stage
funding  dubbed  by  many  analysts  as  the  ‘valley  of  death’—a  classic  market  failure
in early stage innovation.4

The  two  parts  of  this  paradox  are  actually  halves  of  a  single  explanation:  In  the
last 15 years, as the venture capital industry has grown in size, venture firms have
put  more  capital  under  management.  Managing  more  capital  typically  requires  de-
ploying  more  capital  in  each  investment,  that  is,  in  far  larger  increments  than  can
be consumed at the seed stage by start-ups. The bulk of the venture capital industry
has  consequently  drifted  away  from  seed  and  very  early  stage  financing  to  invest
later in more mature stages of a start-up’s life when more capital is required to ex-
pand  operations.  Data  compiled  for  the  National  Venture  Capital  Association  con-
firm all of these trends.5

The  consequence  of  these  trends  is  a  need  for  additional  sources  of  capital  at  the
seed  stage.  That  is  why  my  fund  exists.  And  that  is  one  of  the  reasons  there  is  a
greater need than ever before for ATP, which has always focused on filling the seed-
stage  gap,  helping  to  cross  the  ‘valley  of  death.’  The  need  is  sufficiently  large  that
there  is  plenty  of  room  for  both  government  and  private  money—crowding  out  is
just not an issue.
Unique ATP features

One  of  the  reasons  ATP  works  well  is  that  it  boosts  several  unique  features  that
ought  to  be  more  widely  adopted  across  the  broad  ecosystem  of  federal  technology
programs. ATP competitions are peer-reviewed, pork-free and merit based. The pro-
gram’s public-private cost-sharing, its demonstrated ability to run multiple competi-
tions,  both  general  and  focused  in  areas  of  acute  need,  and  to  run  them  fast  and
on  budget,  its  detailed,  economically  sound  self-assessment,  its  measured  return  on
investment,  its  explicit  mission  to  enhance  U.S.  competitiveness  through  innova-
tion—all set it quite apart from almost every other federal technology program.

So  effective  are  these  attributes,  that  at  the  same  time  the  Bush  Administration
has  sought  to  kill  ATP,  it  has  been  widely  taken  as  an  ideal  model  and  copied  by
foreign  governments  from  Asia  to  Eastern  Europe.  These  same  attributes  are  one

of  the  reasons  the  program  has  so  effectively  played  a  key  role  in  providing  early
capital  to  the  companies  like  Affymetrix  and  SunPower  responsible  for  a  wealth  of
valuable  new  innovation  from  gene  chips,  rapid  DNA  sequencers  and  cheap  digital
mammography  to  fuel  cells,  high-efficiency  solar  photovoltaic  cells  and  novel  engi-
neered materials.6

ATP  is  sometimes  labeled  with  the  profoundly  misleading  and  profoundly  mis-
informed  characterization  of  ‘picking  winners  and  losers’:  That  is,  frankly,  flat
wrong. No investor, private or public, picks winners and losers in technology innova-
tion.  Rather,  it  is  the  market  (customers)  that  does  the  picking.  By  contrast,  with
ATP  and  other  federal  technology  programs,  the  government  is  really  helping  to
plant  long-term  technology  seeds  in  areas  of  private  market  failure  or  acute  public
need.  Some  of  those  technology  seeds  will  sprout,  others  will  not.  But  the  planting,
the activity as a whole, must go forward if long-term economic gains are to be effec-
tively harvested.
Global challenges and U.S. innovation

The  U.S.  faces  numerous  competitive  challenges  globally—among  then,  the  rapid
technological  rise  of  China,  India,  and  parts  of  Eastern  Europe  and  Latin  America,
the  need  to  respond  to  global  climate  change  and  the  concomitant  shift  to  carbon
neutral  energy  sources,  declining  competitive  position  in  certain  technologically  in-
tensive  industries.7 The  only  enduring  answer  to  all  of  these  challenges  that  can
sustain  U.S.  leadership  and  a  growing  standard  of  living  for  future  Americans,  is
increased  long-term  innovation  leading  to  wholly  new  industries  and  to  the  trans-
formation  of  existing  industries.8 In  turn,  substantial  domestic  U.S.  investment  in
research  and  development—both  public  and  private—is  the  prerequisite  for  that
kind of innovation.9

For a variety of reasons—enormous uncertainty, the impossibility of accurate risk
assessment,  extreme  volatility,  appropriability  problems,  among  others,  very  early
stage technology capital markets are especially prone to numerous market imperfec-
tions  including  herd  behavior,  strategic  gaming,  information  asymmetries,  institu-
tional structures focused on early liquidity, and the exercise of market power. These
problems  are  especially  severe  for  especially  risky  new  technical  approaches,  when
intensive  collaboration  across  multiple  technical  disciplines  may  be  essential  for
technical  progress  (therefore  requiring  the  coordination  of  disparate  technical  and
market actors), and wherever a clear, reasonably short-term path is lacking for pri-
vate market actors to reap sufficient returns from their private investment. In those
cases,  federal  technology  funding  mechanisms  have  historically  played  an  essential
role in fostering technical innovation to the point where private capital markets can
then sustain development.

That  is  the  sweet  spot  that  ATP  very  effectively  addresses.  Indeed,  for  reasons
described  earlier,  ATP  is  uniquely  positioned  to  respond  to  the  competitive  chal-
lenges identified above. It is my strong recommendation that Congress re-authorize
the  ATP  program  and  provide  sufficient  funding  for  ATP  to  run  several  competi-
tions,  both  general  competitions  and  focused  competitions  in  areas  of  acute  need  or
promise  such  as  carbon-neutral  alternative  energies  and  energy  storage.  Given  the
importance  of  funding  stability  and  predictability  to  technological  progress,  Con-
gress should also seriously consider ways that ATP might be stably and predictably
funded over the next decade to maximize its contribution to the Nation.

Chairman WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Borrus.
And  I  would  like  to  thank  all  of  the  panelists  to  this  point  for

both your excellent testimony and for your timeliness.

I  would  like  to  announce  just  a  little  bit  in  advance  that,  as  is
typical  of  this  institution,  we  are  not  quite  as  entertaining  as  a
three-ring  circus,  but  we  keep  at  least  three  rings  going  at  any
given  time,  so  we  do  have  Floor  action  going  on.  I  have  another
committee  in  which,  I  understand,  there  will  be  a  vote  sometime
in  the  next  five  or  ten  minutes,  so  if  you  notice  a  little  shuffling
up here, it is not out of disrespect for you, but out of a concern for
adequately discharging our different duties.

And with that, Mr. Murray.

STATEMENT OF MR. PETER MURRAY, VICE PRESIDENT,

WELCH ALLYN, INCORPORATED

Mr. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  want  to  thank,  also,  the  Committee  Members  and  staff  for  in-
viting  me  here  to  testify  on  behalf  of  MEP.  I  can  see  my  presen-
tation is up, so we are off to a good start.

[Slide.]
What I want to talk to you about is the success we have had with
our  local  MEP  in  Oregon,  and  I  will  use  the  term  OMEP,  because
that  is  the  acronym,  and  then  briefly  go  through  some  of  the  de-
tails  of  the  implementation,  the  success  story,  a  very  good  success
story, and then conclude with some observations of the funding and
what  I  think  it  will  do  to  our  local  chapter  and  project  and  what
I think it will do nationally.
Again, that is my agenda.
[Slide.]

We don’t need to see that.
[Slide.]
We  started  with  OMEP  in  2004.  The  company  was  facing  some
serious  competitive  pressures,  and  we  knew  we  needed  to  make
some changes, and we began casting about to select a partner. And
we  clearly  found  OMEP  to  be  the  group  that  met  our  needs.  And
I  will  speak  a  little  bit  more  about  that  later,  but  briefly,  that  is
the timeline.

[Slide.]
What  I  would  like  to  show  you  now  in  a  few  minutes  is  just  ex-
amples  of  the  engagement  work.  It  is  a  lot  of  detail.  I  just  want
to give you an example of the quality of the work that the organiza-
tion  provides.  Again,  these  consultants  are  very  tactical  and  also
very strategic. They gave us a lot of customized solutions, and I am
just going to roll through these.

[Slide.]
There is a lot of generalized training that is shared among all of
the  clients  of  OMEP.  They  develop  customized  tools.  I  am  just
going  to  kind  of  flip  through  these  a  little  bit.  There  are  examples
that are also in the written testimony.

[Slide.]
Again, the examples here really are to convey the point that they
were  teaching  us  how  to  fish  as  opposed  to  giving  us  the  fish.
These  tools  are  broadly  adopted  now  within  our  site  in  Oregon  as
well as spreading into some of our other sites in the company.

[Slide.]
Again,  they  gave  us  tools  so  that  folks  in  the  production  area  or
anyone in the company that were using these productivity enhance-
ments could use them.

[Slide.]
Finally,  some  of  the  results  that  we  achieved,  as  you  can  see  up
here,  these  details  may  not  mean  much,  but  they  were  extremely
significant  to  our  company.  That  represents  about  half  of  the  com-
pany  being  trained  in  two  years.  Again,  part  of  what  OMEP
brought to us was the ability to develop people with ongoing skills
and raise their capabilities so that we could continue to make these
improvements  long  after  our  engagement  with  OMEP  was  com-
pleted.

[Slide.]
Some of the results that we experienced, as you can see up here,
a significant labor savings, plenty of reductions, and these are very
typical results you will see from an MEP engagement. Additionally,
the company was facing some pressures to consolidate a wide vari-
ety  of  sites,  and  we  ended  up  choosing  Oregon  as  one  of  the  sites
to  consolidate  into  as  a  result  of  these  competitive  improvements
that the site had made. So not only are we more competitive exter-
nally, but we are competitive internally.

I want to make a couple of closing comments.
When  I  say,  ‘‘Why  choose  an  OMEP?’’,  why  did  we  decide  to  se-
lect  an  organization  such  as  OMEP,  one  of  the  key  differences  be-
tween  OMEP  and  some  other  providers  that  would  give  us  similar
kinds  of  services,  I  think,  are  the  way  the  MEPs  are  measured  on
the  clients’  results  gives  them  a  focus  that  is  very  much  in  the  in-

terest of the client. I don’t know how else to say that any more sim-
ply.

Again,  this  is  what  is  summarized  in  my  testimony:  they  are

both hands-on. They are both strategic.

Finally, let me just wrap up with where I think the funding pro-
posal would go. I am also on the board of our OMEP affiliate. And
I can tell you from personal experience if they were faced with this
funding  reduction  that  is  in  the  proposal  from  the  Administration,
it would lead to a drastic reduction in services. I think it would re-
duce  the  ability  to  market  to  new  clients.  It  will  have  a  direct  im-
pact  on  the  industry.  Any  company  facing  a  significant  loss  of  rev-
enue  that  this  would  represent  would  take  similar  action.  And  I
firmly believe that the funding levels should be restored, and hope-
fully, with reason, expanded.

Thank you very much. I will take any questions.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Murray follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF PETER MURRAY

Who we are

Welch  Allyn  Monitoring,  a  division  of  Welch  Allyn,  Inc.,  is  located  in  Beaverton,
Oregon.  The  site  currently  employs  approximately  420  people,  up  from  270  two
years ago. Welch Allyn designs, manufactures, and markets mission critical flexible
monitoring  solutions  that  improve  patient  care  and  lower  health  care  operating
costs.  Welch  Allyn  is  a  key  player  in  the  biomedical  device  industry  in  Oregon,  na-
tionally, and worldwide.

Our  company  faces  increased  and  ongoing  pressures  from  domestic  and  foreign
competition.  Our  company  was  confronted  with  a  critical  need  to  increase  profit-
ability, quality, and shorten delivery lead times. The company also wanted to incor-
porate additional manufacturing capacity from another manufacturing location
How OMEP assisted our company

Welch Allyn felt they needed outside expertise to achieve these objectives and con-
ducted a search of local firms. Welch Allyn decided to work with the Oregon Manu-
facturing Extension Partnership (OMEP), a NIST MEP network affiliate, to help us
achieve  a  major  operational  goal  of  continued  improvement  of  manufacturing  proc-
esses,  systems  and  capacity  building.  The  company  views  this  goal  as  essential  to
long-term  financial  growth  and  success.  As  a  corporation,  Welch  Allyn  was  faced
with  difficult  decisions  regarding  consolidation  of  manufacturing  operations  from
four  different  U.S.  sites.  The  Beaverton  operation,  while  operating  at  a  high  level
of quality and capability, sought to strengthen the likelihood of not only maintaining
but  increasing  the  amount  of  manufacturing  at  their  facility.  Welch  Allyn  needed
assistance  to  transforming  its  entire  operation  to  a  culture  of  continuous  improve-
ment.

The  overall  goal  was  to  create  a  culture  of  continuous  improvement.  This  was
done  by  starting  with  Lean  manufacturing  to  obtain  a  larger  and  more  immediate
payback.  The  training  and  implementation  was  initially  focused  at  the  operator
level  and  then  expanded  throughout  the  organization.  OMEP  was  selected  to  work
closely with Welch Allyn to provide classroom training, implementation and support,
and guidance to help them transform into a Lean enterprise.

Because of Welch Allyn’s size and numerous needs, several processes were created

to implement their vision of becoming a Lean enterprise.

1. A  steering  committee  was  created  to  evaluate  opportunities,  select  Lean
projects  and  Kaizen  events,  assign  resources,  and  ensure  continued  focus,
and  direction.  Business  needs  are  clearly  established  and  used  to  prioritize
Lean activities.

2. OMEP provided numerous classes to teach the Lean principles and concepts.
Principles  of  Lean,  5S,  and  Value  Stream  Mapping  were  taught  as  founda-
tion classes. More advanced Lean and leadership classes have helped support
the ongoing transformation.

3. Specific Lean projects and Kaizen events used Value Stream Mapping to im-
plement ‘‘Future States’’ with less waste, increased visibility, better flow, less
Work  in  Process  (WIP),  higher  quality,  and  increased  productivity.  Team

leaders  stayed  on  track  by  reporting  progress  at  a  weekly  accountability
meeting  where  they  also  obtained  help  in  overcoming  roadblocks.  OMEP
helped  Team  Leaders  learn  valuable  skills  as  they  prepared  and  presented
their  results  to  company  and  corporate  executives  at  celebratory  ‘‘close-out’’
meetings.

4. OMEP  worked  closely  with  Welch  Allyn  to  establish  standards,  audits,  and
a significant metrics program to sustain the gains and to create a continuous
improvement environment.

5. Throughout  the  entire  process  OMEP  has  been  key  in  developing  people
within  Welch  Allyn  who  can  internally  drive  and  support  Lean.  OMEP  has
provided  significant  coaching  and  mentoring  in  one-on-one  situations.  To-
gether,  they  have  developed  custom  training  materials  and  have  shared  in
providing Lean training.

Results

• Corporate  has  moved  a  significant  manufacturing  operation  to  Beaverton  re-
sulting  over  50  new  jobs  plus  an  additional  50  jobs  from  organic  growth  cre-
ated in Oregon.

• Operations  have  expanded  into  a  new  facility  to  accommodate  the  increased

growth. There has been over $600,000 invested in the new facilities.

• Welch Allyn has saved nearly $1 million in direct expenses as a result of im-

plementing Lean.

• Inventory has been reduced by more than $500,000.
• Sales of over $120 mil/year have been retained at the Beaverton location.
• Over 250 employees have received Lean training in a total of 750 training oc-

currences (most completed numerous classes).

• More than 20 Lean projects and 10 Kaizen events have successfully been com-

pleted.

provement activities.

• 10  to  15  Lean  ‘‘Stars’’  have  emerged  and  are  driving  daily  continuous  im-

• Lean  methods  have  been  shared  and  implementation  has  expanded  and  is

being used throughout the corporate organization.

• Employee  morale  and  daily  improvement  involvement  has  significantly  in-

creased.

• Workforce training and skills investment: Over $300,000.

Why we support MEP

We  have  had  experience  with  purely  private  consulting  firms  and  we  are  con-
vinced that, based on our experience with OMEP, there are key differences between
MEP (a public/private partnership) and private providers;

• What distinguishes OMEP from similar groups who claim to provide the same
services is OMEP’s unique focus on their client’s success and less so on selling
future services.

• They  provided  core  training  and  implementation  experience  to  get  us  started
and  were  able  then  to  adjust  their  approach  as  we  progressed  through  our
Lean journey.

• Their consultants are both hands on and strategic.
• OMEP has been key to our success in making our Lean transformation.
• We are continuing to expand our Lean Enterprise and we look forward to con-

tinuing to work with OMEP.

The Administration’s reduced funding of the program

I  understand  that  the  Administration  wants  to  cut  by  56  percent  the  funding  for
the  MEP  program  to  $46.332  million  for  FY08.  I  am  on  the  Board  of  OMEP  and
from  a  purely  local  perspective  the  impact  to  the  Oregon  affiliate  would  be  disas-
trous.  If  the  board  were  faced  with  such  a  funding  cut  we  would  likely  be  forced
to  dramatically  reduce  costs  (primarily  staff)  and  thereby  services.  I  would  expect
many  of  the  clients  could  not  afford  to  make  up  the  difference  and  OMEP’s  ability
to market to new clients would also be reduced. The loss to the local economy from
a  withdrawal  of  OMEP  would  lead,  in  my  opinion,  to  a  loss  of  growth  for  many  of
the small companies in the area.

I view the federal funding as an efficient use of federal dollars. From my perspec-
tive  as  a  board  member  for  OMEP,  I  view  the  administration  of  the  organization
as  a  model.  I  have  served  on  the  boards  of  several  profit  and  non-profit  organiza-
tions and I view OMEP as one of the best run organizations.

BIOGRAPHY FOR PETER MURRAY

Peter  Murray  worked  in  the  semiconductor  and  disk  drive  industries  prior  to
spending the last 12 years in the medical device industry. He has worked at Welch
Allyn in Engineering and Manufacturing roles.

He  holds  a  M.S.  and  M.B.A.  from  Boston  University  and  a  B.S.  from  the  Univer-

sity of California.

Chairman WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Murray.
Mr. Ryan.

STATEMENT OF MR. MICHAEL J. RYAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO,

TUG TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

Mr. RYAN. It is, indeed, a pleasure to have the opportunity to ad-

dress the House Science Subcommittee.

[Slide.]
Relative  to  my  comments  I  will  share  with  you,  I  am  going  to
focus on the MEP and the role it plays in helping American compa-
nies to describe and to deploy lean methods.

[Slide.]
I  am  currently  the  CEO  and  President  of  TUG  Technologies  in
Marietta, Georgia, as Dr. Gingrey mentioned. TUG, as such, manu-
factures  ground  support  equipment  for  domestic  and  international
airlines  as  well  as  the  U.S.  armed  forces.  If  you  look  out  the  win-
dow the next time your plane stops at the gate, you will likely see
a TUG baggage tractor, and you will certainly see belt loaders that
are also manufactured by TUG Technologies.

I have had the unique opportunity over the last several years to
work with five of the state MEPs, inclusive, of course, of the State
of  Georgia.  But  after  spending  38  years  in  automotive  and  indus-
trial  companies,  I  would  say  to  you  I  have  learned  how  to  learn.
It  is  about  people,  and  it  is  about  learning.  So  today,  my  thoughts
to share with you specifically focus on the last 13 years, and as an
American,  I  believe  that  we,  in  this  country,  can  be  globally  com-
petitive by deploying lean methods to our manufacturing base. The
MEP has played an important supporting role to enhance American
productivity, now on record for 18 years.

[Slide.]
Back in 1982, I presented at a conference in Brazil as a member
of  TRW’s  senior  management  team.  At  that  time,  I  used  the  flag
to designate and talk to the point that order comes before progress.
The  written  words  on  the  flag  in  Brazil  actually  say  ‘‘Ordem  e
progresso.’’  And  I  think  that  it  is  significant  to  understand  what
that  means  as  the  associated  task  of  the  MEP  continues  to  ramp
up.

[Slide.]
In  1991,  the  result  of  a  U.S.  Government-supported  productivity
study  of  Japan  was  done,  and  the  book  that  came  from  that  was
called  ‘‘The  Machine  that  Changed  the  World.’’  The  machine  is  the
Toyota  Production  System  in  this  designation  in  the  book  written
by  Womack  and  Jones,  and  it  captures  the  Japanese  work  on  pro-
ductivity in the automotive industry primarily.

[Slide.]
I had the opportunity to work with Jim Womack during the time
I  worked  for  United  Technologies,  and  he,  subsequently,  in  1996,

published a book, ‘‘Lean Thinking.’’ And in his book, he talks about
a five-step process, which I show you on the slides.

[Slide.]
Define the value of what you do, align it into a value screen, cre-
ate  flow  from  balancing  process  steps,  create  a  pull  process  where
the  customers’  needs  are  defined,  associate  it  to  your  demand  sup-
port,  and  ultimately  perfection  can  happen.  And  perfection  is  the
perfect  balance  of  the  value,  value  stream,  flow,  pull,  and  perfec-
tion.

[Slide.]
They  do,  however,  list  some  actions  that  are  important  to  con-
sider, and what I have done here is try to align those actions from
that  book  in  line  with  the  steps  they  have  identified,  as  shown  on
this  slide.  And  I  show  you  the  MEP  interface  that  is  appropriate
to  helping  companies  convert  themselves  through  lean  policy  de-
ployment processes.

[Slide.]
Though  significantly,  the  MEP  has  a  role  in  these  process  steps
to success in any company. The basis of learning from Womack and
some  additional  actions.  The  basic  learning  from  Womack  and
Jones,  when  they  looked  at  the  Toyota  Production  System,  is  that
we  understood  man,  material,  and  machine,  but  we,  in  America,
didn’t  have  the  entire  puzzle  put  together.  And  this  is  a  depiction
of  the  Toyota  Production  System  in  one  slide,  one  picture.  And
what  they  have  done  here  is  identify  puzzle  pieces  that,  frankly,  I
believe, we hadn’t yet put together in this country.

[Slide.]
So  how  did  we  take  the  learning  from  this  to  deploy  change  in
this  country?  There  is  an  important  quote  from  the  ultimate  sci-
entist,  in  my  mind,  Albert  Einstein.  I  have  been  referring  to  this
for  many  years.  And  the  questions  I  ask  from  this  quote  are:  Can
we  learn  to  change  our  minds?  Can  we  understand  the  differences
we face? Can we be globally competitive? Can we stay at the same
level of thinking we were at when we created the significant prob-
lems we are trying to fix? And it is said that the definition of a fool
is  one  who  expects  different  results  while  doing  the  same  things.
So, indeed, the challenge of lean and the challenge of the MEP pro-
file is to make people understand and learn.

[Slide.]
In  order  to  deploy  lean,  we  have  an  implementation  standard
that  optimizes  the  efforts  of  independent  companies  and  is  sup-
ported  by  an  education  process  that  understands  the  fundamental
tools.

[Slide.]
What I am showing you here is the depiction of the profile of im-
plementation  for  any  lean  activities.  And  the  support  of  MEP  is
critical here as well. The depiction is an umbrella with leadership.
And  I  would  submit  to  you  that  the  national  MEP  is  that  leader-
ship  profile  that  allows  us  to  succeed.  But  more  importantly,  the
umbrella  is  this  Congress  as  well.  The  Members  of  the  U.S.  Con-
gress  represent  the  support  needed  by  the  MEP  to  truly  lead  the
transformation process to change.

[Slide.]

60

On the next slides, I have just identified some of my experiences
relative  to  those  five  different  state  MEPs.  And  in  fact,  I  started
my  understanding  of  the  MEP  from  having  played  a  part  on  the
board  of  the  Michigan  MEP,  notably  the  MMTC,  Michigan  Manu-
facturers’  Technical  Center.  The  North  Dakota  MEP  was  engaged
in our transformation when I worked as President and CEO of Bob-
cat Company.

[Slide.]
The  teachers  in  Japan  we  call  senseis.  If  you  look  back  at  the
study  that  was  originally  done  by  Womack  and  Jones,  the  oppor-
tunity  to  coordinate  and  learn  is  a  two-part  process,  if  you  would.
The opportunity to create success has a significant amount of bene-
fits, as I show on this slide. But truly, the MEP plays a role of sup-
port  that  would  not  have  a  high  enough  level  of  understanding  to
deploy  the  change  processes  required  by  that  six-step  picture  with
the umbrella supporting it.

[Slide.]
But  what  are  the  benefits?  Here  are  some  of  the  benefits
achieved from doing a lean transformation supported by MEP con-
sultants.  Significant  improvements  in  revenue  at  one  company  of
86  percent  while  operating  income  increased  128  percent.  Again,  a
North  American  company  competing  globally.  Improving  inventory
significantly.  And  improving  the  operational  income  of  the  compa-
nies  by  400,  500,  and  550  basis  points  of  improved  operational  in-
come.  They  reduced  customer  lead  times  and  developed  flawless
launches, as well.

[Slide.]
So now, I ask you to think about a process. Consider that it has
three  versions,  at  least:  what  you  think  it  is;  secondly,  what  it  ac-
tually  is;  and  then  third  here  is  what  it  should  be,  proper  value
stream,  mapping,  and  understand.  And  you  can  imagine  the  effi-
ciency improvements from that step one, two, and three.

[Slide.]
Consider  a  moment  that  Henry  Ford,  at  the  Rouge  Complex  in
Detroit,  delivered  a  car  to  each  customer  in  a  four-day  cycle  from
raw  material  to  finished  vehicle.  And  he  did  that  in  1914.  Most
people  don’t  know  that  he  wrote  a  book  called  ‘‘Today  and  Tomor-
row’’  in  1936  that  described  his  lean  process  from  some  22  years
earlier. Taiichi Ohno developed the Toyota Production System from
his studies of Henry Ford’s methods.

Another  important  point,  Toyota  never  had  to  change  their  bad
habits since after the war they could start from the basics in 1947.
The  challenge  in  America,  still  today,  is  that  we  have  to  change
people from their habits of the past to the global changes and chal-
lenges  we  will  need  to  have  in  the  future.  People  do  make  the  dif-
ference.  In  Japan,  they  call  it,  this  body,  the  JUSE,  the  union  of
Japanese  scientists  and  engineers.  So  they  talk  about  people.  We
talk  about,  basically,  the  focus  of  NIST  as  science  and  technology,
as subject matter very importantly.

[Slide.]
And here, a quote from Jack Welch of General Electric, who chal-
lenges us all to go for the quantum leap. Can we do it by reducing
MEP funding? I don’t think so.

[Slide.]

We  pause  to  look  at  this  picture.  The  worker  is  on  the  left  talk-
ing to the engineer. We need to help the worker here so he can un-
derstand and also be empowered. Today, he is not.

[Slide.]
The  salesmen  in  this  picture  are  on  the  left.  The  two  employees
on the right are wearing safety glasses, so obviously, they must be
production workers. They need, though, a different set of tools, not
just better pails, but the right tools so they can avoid the dilemma
they are in in the first place.

[Slide.]
In  summary,  MEP  has  been  a  strong  contributor  to  the  need  in
this country to stimulate change. They have been and need to con-
tinue  as  a  catalyst  for  that  change.  They  provide  a  countrywide
network.  Our  government  must  continue  to  support  enterprise.
Small  and  medium-sized  businesses  need  this  kind  of  help  even
more.  We  must  remember  that  the  market  is  global,  and  other
countries  are  getting  better,  too.  MEP  provides  education,  not  just
training. And not all good ideas originate in America.

Our  Congress  has  a  responsibility  to  provide  solutions,  not  just
observe.  I  have  found  the  MEP  five  times  in  five  states.  They  are
the  solution.  We  should  expand,  not  retract,  our  support  of  the
MEP.  MEP  is  that  synergy.  If  the  2007  budget  is  reduced  from
$109  million  to  $49  million,  not  only  are  past  efforts  of  the  MEP
compromised,  but  it  would  show  that  the  leadership  umbrella  I
showed you, referring to it earlier, has been closed by our own Con-
gress. Your constituents need your support. Your challenges as our
representatives  to  this  Congress,  are  to  find  synergies  that  allow
Americans  to  prosper  in  an  ongoing,  expanding  global  market.  I
submit that MEP is that synergy.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL J. RYAN

[Slide #1]
It  is,  indeed,  a  pleasure  and  an  honor  to  have  the  opportunity  to  address  the
House Science Committee’s Subcommittee for Science and Innovation. My comments
today  will  focus  on  Lean  Policy  Deployment  and  the  very  necessary  role  that  the
NIST  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  plays  in  helping  American  companies
deploy lean methods.

[Slide #2]
I  am  here  at  the  invitation  of  Representative  Phil  Gingrey  of  Georgia.  I  am  Mi-
chael  John  Ryan,  currently  the  President  and  CEO  of  TUG  Technologies  based  in
Marietta,  Georgia.  TUG  manufactures  ground  support  equipment  for  domestic  and
international airlines and the United States Armed Forces. If you look out the win-
dow  the  next  time  your  plane  stops  at  the  gate,  you’ll  likely  see  a  TUG  baggage
tractor and belt loader. I have had the pleasure of working with NIST MEP’s in five
states  across  our  country.  After  spending  38  years  in  Automotive  and  Industrial
product  companies,  I  have  learned  how  to  learn.  Today,  as  a  witness  to  the  Sub-
committee,  I  will  share  my  thoughts  from  those  experiences,  specifically  over  the
past  13  years.  I  am  an  American  who  believes  that  we  can  be  globally  competitive
by  deploying  lean  methods  to  our  manufacturing  base  in  this  country.  MEP  has
played  an  important  supporting  role  to  enhance  American  Productivity  now  for  18
years.

[Slide #3]
Back  in  1982  when  I  was  Director  of  Quality  for  TRW,  I  spoke  at  a  global  con-
ference  in  Brazil  about  the  need  to  establish  structure  before  improvements  can  be
expected  in  any  change  process.  After  spending  11  years  working  for  Ford  Motor
Company,  I  had  learned  that  Henry  Ford’s  successes  were  built  on  very  structured
methods.

[Slide #4]
Since I was in Brazil at a global conference, I used the flag of Brazil to make my
point.  Their  flag  says  ‘‘order  and  progress.’’  Our  approach  to  change  too  requires
order before progress is possible.

[Slide #5]
In  1991,  the  results  of  a  U.S.  Government-sponsored  study  on  the  productivity  of
Japan  was  published  by  Womack,  Jones,  and  Roos  in  their  book  entitled  ‘‘The  Ma-
chine  That  Changed  the  World.’’  Here  is  where  they  first  described  their  findings
at  Toyota  as  ‘‘Lean  Manufacturing.’’  In  this  book  they  captured  the  reasons  that
Japanese  productivity  in  the  automotive  industry  was  improving  faster  than  in  the
USA.  I  had  the  opportunity  to  meet  Jim  Womack  in  1995  at  United  Technologies,
just  before  their  next  book,  Lean  Thinking,  was  published.  In  this  new  book  they
provided case studies showing how several American and European companies were
deploying lean methods.

[Slide #6]
They describe five steps in a transformation as you see here (value, value stream,
flow,  pull,  and  perfection).  But  no  where  is  it  written;  how  to  implement  the  ‘‘lean
process.’’

[Slide #7]
They  do,  however,  list  some  actions  that  are  important  to  consider.  Here,  I  show
you  their  action  steps  and  also  identify,  from  my  experience,  the  responsibility  for
each action. Here is where the MEP is extremely important to the process of change.

[Slide #8]
Here they continue to identify the steps. (pause) Here again I have identified the

critical role MEP plays in these process steps.

[Slide #9]
The  basis  of  learning  that  Womack  and  Jones  discovered  is  best  depicted  by  the
Toyota  Production  System  as  described  here.  We  already  understood  the  alignment
of Man, Material, and Machine, but they helped us fit the other pieces of the puzzle
together as shown here as a ‘‘Global Production System.’’ How did we use this learn-
ing to deploy change?

[Slide #10]
Here is an important quote from Albert Einstein that I have been referring to for
many  years.  (pause)  Can  we  learn  to  change  our  minds?  Can  we  understand  the
differences we face? Can we be globally competitive? Can we stay at the same level
of  thinking  we  were  at  when  we  created  significant  problems?  It  is  said  that  the
definition  of  a  fool  is  one  who  expect  different  results  while  doing  the  same  things.

[Slide #11]
In  order  to  deploy  a  Lean  Policy  we  have  to  have  an  implementation  standard
that  optimizes  the  efforts  of  independent  companies  and  is  supported  by  an  edu-
cation  process  that  understands  the  fundamental  tools  of  a  lean  system.  Back  in
1994 I was Vice President Quality and Continuous Improvement at UT Automotive.
I had the opportunity to work with United Technologies’ other companies like Pratt
and  Whitney,  Otis,  Carrier,  Hamilton  Standard  and  Sikorsky.  I  have  used  this  de-
piction  of  the  deployment  process  ever  since.  The  Leadership  umbrella  represents
the  role  of  company  leaders  to  support  and  protect  a  six-step  sequential  process  to
transform  a  company  as  it  accepts  the  changes  needed  to  become  ‘‘world  class.’’  It
is  these  six  steps  of  transformation  that  need  the  supporting  structure  of  the  Na-
tional  MEP.  We  have  tried  to  empower  our  employees  through  Quality  Circles.  We
have taught SPC statistics to address TQM. But neither has worked. Why not? Be-
cause we must create product cells first, and then the sequence can follow. The MEP
knows this! Most consultants do not.

[Slide #12]
Here  I  am  sharing  my  own  experiences  with  the  application  of  MEP  capabilities.
I’ve  listed  the  companies  I  have  worked  for  over  the  past  13  years  and  then  I  am
showing  the  five  different  state-supported  MEP  organizations  where  I  have  had  an
affiliation.  Back  in  2000,  I  was  a  board  member  of  MMTC,  a  Michigan  MEP.  In
2003,  I  was  President  and  CEO  for  the  Bobcat  Company,  a  division  of  Ingersoll
Rand.  The  North  Dakota  MEP  was  engaged  in  our  transformation  there.  In  2005,
Bobcat Company joined a WMEP consortium with Harley Davidson, Oshkosh Truck
and  Trane  to  develop  a  supplier  assessment  tool.  This  coordination  between  OEM’s
and their supply base can be uniquely filled by the MEP. To the right I am showing
the times I have also used the expertise of Shingijutsu. This is a teaching organiza-
tion, based in Japan, that is made up of former students of Taichi Ohno. Ohno san
is  the  ‘‘father’’  of  the  Toyota  Production  System.  These  teachers,  called  Sensei  in
Japanese,  provide  the  ultimate  level  of  expertise  to  refine  the  application  of  a  lean
system.  In  fact,  this  week  we  are  conducting  kaizen  at  TUG’s  Marietta  and  Ken-
nesaw facilities in Georgia, supported by Shingijutsu. Without the support of MEP,

63

we would not have a high enough level of understanding to deploy the change proc-
esses required.

[Slide #13]
So,  what  are  the  benefits  from  these  activities.  I  have  listed  several  for  you  here
from my own experiences. Significant improvement in revenue growth of 86 percent
and operating income of 128 percent are examples. Large reductions in warranty ex-
penses  and  improved  customer  satisfaction.  Improved  inventory  turns;  from  five  to
25  and  from  two  to  16  in  two  examples.  Operating  income  improvements  of  400,
500, and 550 basis points over a two-year period at three different companies.

[Slide #14]
Reduced  customer  lead  times.  Flawless  product  launches,  continuous  kaizen,  and
an  expanded  use  of  employee  intellectual  capital  were  achieved.  Through  the  Geor-
gia Tech MEP in the past four months we have trained 79 staff associates in VSM,
Office kaizen, and Lean methods at TUG Technologies.

[Slide #15]
So,  now,  think  of  a  process.  Consider  that  it  has  at  least  three  versions.  First;

what you think it is.

[Slide #16]
Second; what it actually is.
[Slide #17]
And then third; what it should be.
[Slide #18]
Consider a moment that Henry Ford at the Rouge Complex near Detroit delivered
a  car  to  a  customer  in  just  four  days  from  raw  material  to  finished  car.  That  was
in  1914.  Most  people  don’t  know  that  he  wrote  a  book,  ‘‘Today  and  Tomorrow,’’  in
1936  that  describes  his  lean  process  from  some  22  years  earlier.  Taichi  Ohno,  in-
deed, developed the Toyota Production System from his studies of Henry Ford. One
other important point; Toyota never had to change ‘‘bad habits’’ since, after the war
they could start from the basics in 1947. The challenge in America still today is that
we  have  to  change  people  from  their  habits  of  the  past  to  the  global  challenges  in
our future.

[Slide #19]
People do make the difference! In Japan they have the JUSE body focused on peo-
ple.  It  may  be  subtle,  but  they  talk  about  scientists  and  engineers  while  we  look
at  science  and  technology.  Sometimes  we  seem  too  focused  on  issues  and  material
things.  MEP  provides  NIST  with  an  opportunity  to  focus  on  the  people.  We  must
get more globally competitive.

[Slide #20]
A  quote  from  Jack  Welch  of  General  Electric,  who  challenges  us  all  to  go  for  the
Quantum  Leap.  Do  we  accept  his  challenge?  Can  we  do  it  by  reducing  MEP  fund-
ing? I don’t think so!

[Slide #21]
(pause)  The  worker  on  the  left  is  talking  to  the  engineer.  We  need  to  help  the

worker here, so he can understand and also be empowered. Today he is not.

[Slide #22]
(pause) The salesmen are on the left. The two employees on the right are wearing
safety  glasses,  so  they  must  be  production  workers.  They  need  a  different  set  of
tools,  not  just  better  pails,  but  the  right  tools  so  they  can  avoid  their  dilemma  in
the first place.

[Slide #23]
In  summary,  MEP  has  been  a  strong  contributor  to  the  need  in  our  country  to
stimulate  change.  They  have  been,  and  need  to  continue  as  a  catalyst  for  change.
They provide a country wide network. Our government must continue to support en-
terprise. Small and medium-sized companies need this kind of help; even more. We
must remember that the market is global and other countries are getting better too.
MEP provides education; not training. Not all good ideas originate in America.

Our  Congress  has  a  responsibility  to  provide  solutions,  not  just  observe.  I  have
found  the  MEP  five  times,  in  five  states.  They  are  the  solution.  We  should  expand,
not retract our support for the MEP budget needs. MEP is that synergy. If the 2007
budget  is  reduced  from  $109M  to  $47M,  not  only  are  past  efforts  of  the  MEP  com-
promised,  but  it  would  show  that  the  leadership  umbrella  I  referred  to  earlier  has
been  closed  by  our  own  Congress.  Your  constituents  need  your  support.  Your  chal-
lenges  as  our  Representatives  to  this  Congress  are  to  find  synergies  that  allow

DISCUSSION

Chairman WU. Well, thank you, Mr. Ryan.
And now we will have some discussion here.
I recognize the Chair for five minutes.

MANUFACTURING EXTENTION PARTNERSHIPS

Dr.  Jeffrey,  we  have  had  eloquent,  effective  testimony  about  the
need  for  MEP.  Let  us  just  declare  the  50-some-odd-percent  cut  in
MEP dead on arrival for now, and we will set that issue aside, and
we  will  move  on  to  some  other  things  and  maybe  circle  back  to
that.

I  understand  that  NIST  intends  to  re-compete  all  the  MEP  cen-
ters  this  spring,  because  you  anticipate  some  reduction  in  funding
from Congress. I would like to understand as best as possible, how
much  this  re-competition  will  cost  NIST  and  the  MEP  centers.  I,
quite frankly, think that Congress is more likely to relatively fully

fund  MEP  again  this  year.  And  I  am  a  little  bit  concerned  about
a  waste  of  not  only  money  but,  you  know,  when  you  wave  an  axe
in  front  of  a  whole  flock  of  turkeys,  it  gets  everybody  upset,  and
nobody  gets  back  to  feeding  and  growing  more  turkey  for  a  while.
So  I  would  really  like  to  understand  why  you  are  doing  this,
what  the  estimated  cost  is,  and  get  a  sense  for  how  much  this  is
going to upset the whole flock of very hardworking folks.

Dr.  JEFFREY.  Well,  the  intent  is  certainly  not  to  upset  the  flock.
In  terms  of  the  actual  costs,  I  will  have  to  take  that  for  the
record. I don’t have the numbers in front of me, and so I would be
happy to answer in writing to you on the costs.

In  terms  of  the  rationale  as  to  why  do  this  at  this  point,  to  do
an  effective  re-competition,  it  would  take  about  five  to  six  months.
If  the  budget  reduction  did  occur,  and  we  were  to  start  that  after
the  final  appropriations,  by  the  time  we  completed  that  competi-
tion,  we  would  be  out  of  money  if  we  had  all  of  the  centers  at  the
same spend rate. So what the re-competition allows, one, is a more
efficient  way  of  trying  to  get  through  to  try  to  extract  where  there
may  be  some  savings  in  the  program,  where  there  may  be  slightly
different  business  models  to  attract  additional  fee  extraction,  and
where  there  may  be  efficiencies  in  consolidation  that  would  allow
for the maximum amount of service.

If  the  budget  cut  did  occur  and  we  waited  until  the  end  to  then
try  to  address  that,  we  would  actually  have  to  be  in  a  position  of
just  cutting  every  single  center  by  the  same  percentage,  which
would probably create much more of a disruption, and a——

Chairman WU. Well——
Dr. JEFFREY.—weaker system at that point.
Chairman  WU.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Jeffrey.  But  given  that  Congress
is  opposed  to  the  MEP  re-competition  and,  in  fact,  in  fiscal  year
2005,  NIST  was  specifically  prohibited  from  doing  the  re-competi-
tion,  I  think  there  is  some  room  to  inquire  as  to  why  this  path  is
being  pursued,  because  if  we  need  to,  I  suspect  that  we  might  put
that prohibition back in the appropriations bill.

And  I  would  like  to  get  a  sense  from  Mr.  Murray  and  Mr.  Ryan
about what you think the effect of a re-competition across the coun-
try would have on MEP centers.

Mr. MURRAY. Can we reply?
Chairman WU. Yes, I am asking both of you about——
Mr. MURRAY. I will go first.
Chairman WU.—your take on the effect of a re-competition.
Mr. MURRAY. Okay. I think it would be disastrous, to use a word.
Again, I am speaking as a board member of the affiliate in Oregon.
The  organization,  as  it  is  now,  is  extremely  lean.  I  have  been  to
their  offices.  They  camp  out  in  a—kind  of  a—it  is  anything  but
plush.  The  staff  is  incredibly  efficient  and  very  lean.  I  really  don’t
know where they would find additional savings. I think it would be
a  distraction  for  that  business,  take  away  already  limited  re-
sources,  to  look  for  new  business  or  to  market  to  other  clients.  I
really  think  it  would  be  a  disaster.  I  can’t  say  it  strongly  enough.

Chairman WU. Thank you, Mr. Murray.
Mr. Ryan, do you have anything to add?
Mr.  RYAN.  As  I  mentioned  earlier  in  my  talk  that  the  MEP  rep-
resents  synergy.  One  of  the  things  that  I  don’t  believe  we  do  well

enough  in  our  country  in  the  manufacturing  sector  is  identify  the
cost relationship between the supply chain steps. The OEM manu-
facturer of a finished product, the supplier of subsystems, the sup-
plier  of  parts  to  the  subsystems,  et  cetera,  is  the  supply  chain.
Knotting  that  together,  as  well  as  by  state  representation,  allows
for  some  common  methodology  across  the  country  to  accept  the
challenge to be cost-reducing our products and to accept the oppor-
tunity to be more competitive globally.
Chairman WU. Thank you, Mr. Ryan.
I see that my time is actually 24 seconds over.
You  know,  if  I  do  not  have  an  opportunity  to  return  to  this  par-
ticular topic, I would like the witnesses, especially you, Dr. Jeffrey
and Mr. Murray and Mr. Ryan, to comment upon what Dr. Jeffrey
alluded  to  earlier,  which  is  to  compensate  for  the  Administration’s
proposed  cuts,  which,  in  my  view,  are,  one  hopes,  unlikely  at  this
point  by  having  them  be  absorbed  by  increasing  charges  to  small
and medium-sized manufacturers and what the effect of this would
be  on  services  and  uptake  of  services  from  the  current  client  base,
or  customer  base,  if  you  will.  So  the  makeup  of  government  funds
through additional charges in fees.

First  of  all,  it  was  a  shame  to  lose  Dr.  Gingrey  for  a  very  nec-
essary  trip  for  our  friend,  Mr.  Norwood,  and  Dr.  Gingrey  is  the
Ranking Member of the Subcommittee. I would like to welcome Mr.
Hall,  the  Ranking  Member  of  the  Full  Science  and  Technology
Committee.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall,  for  being  here.  I  wanted  to  wel-
come  Mr.  Hall,  but  my  understanding  is  that  Mr.  Smith  had  some
time constraints.

Mr. Hall, a southern gentleman from morning to night.
Mr. Smith, you are recognized for five minutes.
Mr.  SMITH.  Thank  you.  I,  obviously,  am  not  a  Ranking  Member,

but I appreciate the opportunity to be here.

Mr.  Ryan,  I  believe  you  talked  about  empowering  workers  and
affording  workers  the  tools.  Do  you  feel  that  our  existing  channels
of empowering workers are sufficient? What suggestions might you
have  for,  perhaps,  a  change  in  paradigm,  or  whatever  the  case
might be, to empower workers?

Mr.  RYAN.  In  my  testimony,  I  make  comments  about  20  years
ago  when  the  country  was  focused  on  quality  circles  on  SBC.  Sta-
tistics,  if  you  would,  Dr.  Deming  methodologies.  That  is  some  20-
plus  years  ago.  What  I  showed  in  my  presentation  is  an  umbrella
chart,  as  I  call  it,  with  six  significant  steps  in  sequence.  And  the
second  step  in  that  sequence  is  empowerment  of  the  people.  But
the  first  step  is  product  sales  structure.  You  have  to  be  in  an  ap-
propriate structural physical manner in a manufacturing facility in
order  for  people  to  be  empowered.  Otherwise,  management  just
pushes  the  problem  at  the  employee  and  frustrates  them  even
more.

So  my  point  is  that  the  discipline  for  that  six-step  sequence,
starting  with  the  product  sales  structure  to  the  six-step  standard-
ization,  the  distinction  of  that  is  the  people  get  empowered  once
you create the structure that they can be and add, what I call, ‘‘in-
tellectual  capital’’  to  the  process.  It  is  a  huge  opportunity  that
comes  from  a  lean  transformation.  And  again,  the  opportunity  for
productivity  in  this  country  amongst  the  people  in  small-  and  me-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:12 Sep 10, 2007 Jkt 033107 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\021507\33107 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

81

dium-sized  business  is  what  will  make  us  better  as  production
management of large subsystems and vehicles and products for the
associated markets served.

So  the  people  empowerment  needs  that  first  step,  and  the  MEP
understands  that  sequence.  And  frankly,  if  you  just  go  hire  a  con-
sultant  in  the  local  state  and  not  the  MEP  support,  what  you  will
find  is  unique  opinions  of  what  the  proper  process  is.  And  again,
as  I  said  earlier  that  Jim  Womack,  who  is  the  expert  in  lean  con-
cepts  from  back  in  1991  on  this  survey  work  back  at  MIT,  the
learning  is  there,  but  the  absolute  application  of  that  learning  is
still missing, and the linkage of the MEP—and my experience with
five states, not all 50 yet, maybe I will live long enough to do that,
but in those five states, that linkage is common. And so I am shar-
ing  with  you  that  it  isn’t  just  the  consulting  activity  at  MEP.  It  is
a  common  linkage  of  how  things  are  done  and  the  philosophy  will
get us there. If we take it down a notch or two or three or in half,
as the proposal says, we lose what we have built up over 18 years,
unfortunately. And that would be a travesty. And I do believe that
Congress  needs  to  support  the  people,  and  the  people  need  to  un-
derstand the profile of lean.

Thank you.
Mr. SMITH. Thank you.

R&D AT NIST

And  also,  Dr.  Jeffrey,  how  does  NIST  evaluate  new  projects  and
novel fields of research, and are potential economic benefits explic-
itly  considered  when  determining  research  priorities?  And  do  you
perform  a  formal  needs  assessment  with  involvement  from  the  ex-
ternal community?

Dr. JEFFREY. Thank you, sir.
Our  mission  statement  is  to  support  the  economic  security  and
quality of life of Americans, and so every new initiative we put for-
ward goes through a rigorous internal process that includes inputs,
generally,  from  industry.  It  includes  looking  at  what  the  kinds  of
impacts  will  be.  Prospective  studies  have  large  errors  to  them,  so
often use best technical judgments involved.

Nanotechnology  is  a  great  example  of  where  there  have  been  a
number  of  studies  that  have  indicated  that  nanotechnology  in  the
next  10  years  may  be  anywhere  from  a  $1  to  $2.5  trillion  global
enterprise. And a lot of the issues there have to do with the meas-
urements characterizations which Dr. Williams very eloquently de-
scribed in his testimony.

In  addition,  we  reach  out  to  the  private  sector,  probably  more
than  any  other  part  of  the  federal  S&T  enterprise  to  really  try  to
get  an  idea  of  what  the  potential  measurement  barriers  to  innova-
tion  are.  And  in  fact,  we  just  completed  our  first  assessment  of
what  we  call  the  U.S.  measurement  system,  which  actually  looked
at  over  160  industry  technical  roadmaps,  had  over  1,000  people
from the private sector participating with the NIST scientists to try
to  identify  where  there  are  current  measurement  barriers  to  inno-
vation. And so we just catalogued that, just literally, released a re-
port, and now using that as part of our strategic planning to iden-
tify and prioritize our investments.

Mr. SMITH. Thank you.

ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM

Mr. CHANDLER. Thank you, Chairman Wu.
And  I  thank  all  of  the  witnesses  for  coming  today.  I  appreciate

you shedding some light on some of these topics.

I  would  like  to,  Dr.  Jeffrey,  ask  you  a  little  bit  about  the  Ad-
vanced  Technology  Program,  if  I  may.  I  understand,  from  Mr.
Borrus, that he feels that that is an important program, and I un-
derstand  that  the  Administration  feels  otherwise,  that  the  Admin-
istration sees no need for it. Is there a particular need now, as Mr.
Borrus  claims,  for  seed  stage  investing?  Please  illuminate  that  a
little bit for me.

Dr. JEFFREY. Thank you, sir.
The  Administration  recognizes  the  benefits  that  the  ATP  pro-
gram has generated. It is an effectively-run program, and actually,
I  would  have  to  say,  I  am  actually  very  proud,  as  NIST’s  Director,
to  be  hearing  about  success  stories  from  all  of  the  programs,  be-
cause we do execute and run the programs as efficiently and effec-
tively as possible.

Mr. CHANDLER. And therefore, we need to get rid of——
Dr.  JEFFREY.  Well,  the  issue  isn’t  whether  the  program  is  effec-
tively  managed.  The  issue  is,  in  the  Administration’s  viewpoint,
whether  or  not  it  is  the  appropriate  role  for  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  to  be  playing.  And  it  gets  down  to  whether  there  are  other
policy mechanisms that may be able to help turn the tide that Mr.
Borrus  described  of  the  private-sector  investing  in  the  early  seed
or whether a direct federal investment is necessary, and that basi-
cally  gets  down  to  a  philosophical  issue.  But  there  really  isn’t  so
much an issue as to the effectiveness.

Mr.  CHANDLER.  Well,  my  understanding  of  what  you  are  saying
is if it is not broken, break it? I mean, you are saying that the pro-
gram  is  working  well,  but  now  you  are  saying  that  somehow  it  is
not the role of government to be a part of a program that is work-
ing well?

Dr. JEFFREY. Yes. There are a lot of effective programs that have
different levels of priority for the Federal Government. And clearly,
we are in a position where there are tight federal budgets. And, we
have to prioritize what our investments are going to be based upon
not  just  merit  but  also  where  we  can  make  the  biggest  difference
as  the  Federal  Government.  And  that  is  what  gets  folded  into  the
calculus.

Mr.  CHANDLER.  Well,  let  me  give  Mr.  Borrus  a  chance,  if  you

would like to add something.

Mr.  BORRUS.  I  would  only  say  that  not  only  is  it  an  appropriate
role  for  the  Federal  Government,  it  is  a  historically-consistent,
well-established  role  for  the  Federal  Government  over  at  least  the
last century and a half, if not longer, since the Morrill Act creation
of  land-grant  colleges  and  the  Agricultural  Extension  Service,
which similarly, for the technologies of its time, sought to move in-
novation  out  of  the  colleges  and  out  of  the  research  institutes  into
agriculture.  You  know,  it  is  not  a  departure  for  the  U.S.  Govern-

ment. It is not something new. This is a historically-consistent and
well-received tradition. And it ought to be continued.

Mr. CHANDLER. Thank you.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman WU. Thank you very much.
The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hall.

MEASUREMENT BARRIERS TO INNOVATION

Mr. HALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to try to get two questions in.
But first—and I would like a fairly direct and maybe a yes or no

answer to one of the questions.

Dr.  Jeffrey  and  Dr.  Williams,  both  of  you  referred  to  the  NIST
report that identifies over 700 measurement barriers to innovation
in critical industries. Give me not 700 but a few of the concrete ex-
amples of some of these barriers, first, and then just tell me wheth-
er or not there is a consensus on which barriers ought to be a pri-
ority  for  NIST  to  address.  That  last  one,  you  can  say  yes  or  no
and—without naming them. But give me just some examples, so we
will have it in the record.

Dr. Williams, do you want to start?
Dr. WILLIAMS. Yes, thank you.
Specifically,  in  this  area  of  nanotechnology,  we  are  now  getting
into the realm of where electronic devices on circuits are just a few
atoms  thick,  and  they  are  starting  to  get  tens  of  atoms  wide.  And
in the not-too-distant future, literally, a single electronic device will
be made up of a handful of atoms. The metrology requirements for,
first  of  all,  measuring  the  size  of  the  device  and  then  identifying
which  atoms  are  in  the  device  and  where  they  are  within  the  de-
vice are absolutely daunting, and yet they are absolutely crucial for
being able to understand the operation and being able to design fu-
ture types of devices.

So  it  is  this  issue  of  literally  counting  and  identifying  individual
atoms  in  a  three-dimensional  structure:  when  we  can  get  to  that
point, the amount of progress that we are going to be able to make
will  really  be  stunning.  So  I  would  say  that  that,  for  me,  is  a  key
and critical issue.

Also,  another  one  is  literally  metering  light  particles,  photons,
one  at  a  time.  We  are  now  at  the  stage  where  we  are  generating
and  detecting  single  photons,  and  we  are  using  those  single  pho-
tons  to  carry  important  information.  And  that  is  another  issue,
which is key and critical to the issue of metrology.

Mr. HALL. Dr. Jeffrey, do you want to——
Dr.  JEFFREY.  Actually,  Dr.  Williams  did  an  excellent  job.  And
thank you for allowing a plug. And here is a copy of the report that
I will leave for you——

Mr. HALL. Okay.
Dr. JEFFREY.—afterwards. I will just add that——
Mr. HALL. Does that have all 700 of them in there?
Dr.  JEFFREY.  Actually,  it  does.  There  is  a  CD  in  the  back  with

all of the data.

Mr. HALL. All right.
Dr. JEFFREY. Believe me. It is a fascinating read.
Mr. HALL. With pictures or——

84

Dr. JEFFREY. Not too many pictures, sorry. But one of the things
I  will  just  add  is  that  what  we  concentrated  on  was  11  different
industry  sectors  in  this  as  a  beginning,  and  so  it  runs  the  gamut
from  several  of  the  measurements  that  Dr.  Williams  described
down  to  some  of  the  near-term  needs  of  today’s  auto  industry,  in-
formation  technology,  and  others.  And  I  will  leave  a  copy  behind
for you, sir.

Mr. HALL. All right. I thank you for it.
You  should  have  given  me  one  the  other  day,  and  I  would  have
been studying it, and I could have taken a test on it or something.

Dr. JEFFREY. We just released it on Monday, sir.
Mr. HALL. And I was going to ask you if there is a consensus on
which  barriers  should  be  a  priority  for  NIST  to  address,  but  they
are prioritized in your article there, are they not?

Dr.  JEFFREY.  Well,  one  of  the  things  that  we  are  doing,  sir,  is
that  we  are  taking  these,  and  we  are  now  doing  what  I  will  call
a ‘‘deep dive’’, trying to identify whether or not there are some sys-
temic  issues,  as  opposed  to  723  separate  ones,  that  would  be  the
ones to really focus on.

And one of the unique aspects of what this study did was it iden-
tified  measurement  barriers  to  innovation  that  may  not  fall  just
within  the  NIST  purview,  and  so  we  are  reaching  out  to  industry,
to  universities,  and  to  other  government  agencies  so  that  we  can
get a more comprehensive attack on these issues. But we are at the
point  now  where  we  are  starting  to  look  at  the  systemic  issues,  to
see  if  there  are  systemic  issues,  which  would  then  lead  to  that
prioritization.

Mr. HALL. I lost a bet. I bet that I could get a yes or no. And——
Dr. JEFFREY. Yes.
Mr.  HALL.  There  was  a  President  who  didn’t  speak  very  much,
and a young journalist said, ‘‘Mr. President, I have a bet that I can
get  you  to  say  at  least  three  words.’’  His  answer  was,  ‘‘You  lose.’’

Thank you for that.
But Dr. Jeffrey, while I am talking to you. Over the past several
years,  this  committee,  we  have  been  active  in  promoting  the  na-
tionwide  transition  to  electronic  health  records  that  we  think  hold
a  great  promise  for  reducing  medical  errors  and  lowering  the  cost
of  medical  care.  Can  you  summarize  the  efforts  that  NIST  has
made  to  help  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  pro-
mote  EHR  and  the  adoption  of  information  technology  solutions
generally within the health care industry?

Dr. JEFFREY. Yes, thank you, sir.
NIST  has  been  working  very  closely  as  a  partner,  supporting
HHS,  which  has  the  lead  on  this.  And  we  are  working  in  several
different  areas.  One  is  working  with  the  private  sector  and  stand-
ards  development  organizations  to  try  to  get  some  coherence  and
compatibility  on  some  of  the  standards  for  interoperability  of  sys-
tems.  We  are  also  working  and  supporting  some  of  the  contracts
that  HHS  has  out,  providing  technical  underpinning  to  them,  and
also  looking  at  some  of  the  validation  mechanisms  that  will  come
into  play.  So  we  sort  of  tied  in  with  HHS  throughout  the  full  end-
to-end gamut.

Mr. HALL. I thank you. My time is out, and I understand we can

write letters, make inquiries, and they will answer them.

MANUFACTURING EXTENSION PARTNERSHIP; ADVANCED

TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM

Mr. MATHESON. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  apologize.  I  had  another  meeting  and  didn’t  get  to  be  here  to
hear  all  of  the  testimony,  and  I  want  to  cover  something  that,  I
think, has been discussed a little bit before.

But  Dr.  Jeffrey,  I  wanted  to  ask  you  a  couple  questions,  again,

related to the MEP program.

This is a program, as we all know, that is a state/federal partner-
ship. And I am curious, since there has been this continued annual
process  where  the  Administration  has  advocated  reductions  in  the
MEP  budget,  if  the  Administration  has  ever  consulted  with  the
states  and  their  funding  agencies  about  your  intent  and  how  the
program  would  operate  under  the  budget  cut.  It  is  my  under-
standing  that,  at  least  in  my  State  of  Utah,  the  MEP  center  has
not been consulted on this budget proposal. And I think that many
state  agencies  would  likely  simply  reduce  their  share  of  matching
funds if the federal share is cut. But do you have an understanding
of how states would react to these proposed cuts?

Dr.  JEFFREY.  In  terms  of  the  outreach,  obviously,  one  of  the
issues  is  discussing  the  budget  before  it  is  actually  submitted.
Since the budget proposal has come up to the Hill, I know that the
Director  of  the  MEP  program  has  been  talking  with  the  centers,
having them understand what the implications would be, and hav-
ing  them  start  thinking  about  what  the  right  approach  would  be
to  be  moving  forward.  But  as  you  point  out,  this,  I  believe,  is  the
fifth  year  of  this  see-saw,  and  so  I  wouldn’t  say  that  it  is  a  com-
plete shock to the centers, but we are working with them now and
before any kind of re-competition would occur to make sure that ev-
erybody understands what the ground rules are, what we are look-
ing  for,  and  how  to  maintain  the  most  effective  process  for  the
small manufacturers that are out there.

Mr.  MATHESON.  Let  me  ask.  As  I  understand  it,  one  of  the  jus-
tifications  from  OMB  for  the  budget  cut  in  the  MEP  program  is
that almost 20 percent of the MEP clients are manufacturing firms
that have more than 250 employees and that these firms would be
able to make up the funding difference due to their size. Is this an
indication  that  the  Administration  now  considers  manufacturers
with  more  than  250  employees  as  outside  the  traditional  federal
definition  of  a  ‘‘small  business,’’  the  point  being  that  the  SBA  de-
fines small businesses as having less than 500 employees?

Dr.  JEFFREY.  I  am  not  sure  about  the  specific  OMB  reference
that  you  are  making,  but  we  adopted  the  SBA  definition  for  what

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:12 Sep 10, 2007 Jkt 033107 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\021507\33107 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

86

a  ‘‘small  manufacturer’’  is,  so  that  we  are  consistent  with  that.  So
it would be 500 people under the MEP program.

Mr.  MATHESON.  Okay.  Well,  then  we  do  have  a  disagreement
here, and we will follow-up in written form and show you the OMB
document that shows that they define it as if you are over 250, you
don’t need MEP anymore. And I would be happy to share that with
you,  because  I  am  curious  what  evidence  the  Administration  is
using  to  say  that  clients  with  more  than  250  employees  suddenly
don’t need MEP. I think that would be a helpful exchange to have,
because,  quite  frankly,  I  think  you  know  this,  the  average  manu-
facturing size in this country is about 33 employees.

One more question on MEP.
Is  there  a  sense,  under  the  proposed  budget,  how  NIST  is  going
to  decide  which  centers  will  remain  operational,  assuming  there
would be a smaller system overall?

Dr.  JEFFREY.  Yes,  sir.  One  of  the  things  that  we  discussed  was
that there would be a re-competition that would basically have the
centers come back with the plan for how they would be able to keep
their  effective  services  with  the  lower  federal  budget.  And  that
could  fall  under  a  number  of  things  from  cost  savings  within  the
centers  to  consolidation  to  future  action  to  whatever  business
model they want to have.

One  of  the  things  that  I  think  is  very  important  to  maintain  is
that  there  is  an  important  role  for  the  Federal  Government  in  the
MEP  program.  And,  I  think  it  is  very  important  that  we  under-
stand  that.  There  are  really  three  absolutely  critical  core  missions
that  the  Federal  Government  needs  to  maintain.  One  is  there  has
to be a driver for producing the new kinds of products and services
that  can  then  get  propagated  throughout  the  network,  things  like
lean  manufacturing  and  some  of  the  other  concepts  that  were
talked about by two witnesses.

Second,  it  has  to  maintain  the  quality  of  each  of  the  centers.
There needs to be, essentially, that umbrella organization to ensure
that an absolute standard of quality is maintained.

And  third,  it  basically  has  to  have  enough  skin  in  the  game  so
that  the  focus  does  stay  on  the  small  manufacturers  and  doesn’t
just  go  to  those  customers  that  might  be—what  centers  might
gravitate to without the federal pressure.

And  those  are  the  three  really  critical  pieces  that  we  need  to  be
able  to  maintain  within  NIST,  and  I  think  we  can  do  that  within
that budget.

Mr.  MATHESON.  Well,  Dr.  Jeffrey,  I  don’t  think  anyone  is  going
to  disagree  with  those  three  factors  as  to  what  needs  to  be  main-
tained,  but  it  seems  like  the  proposed  budget  cut  runs  completely
counter  to  the  desire  to  pursue  these  three  factors,  and  I  suspect
there is a bipartisan group on this committee which disagrees with
this proposed budget cut.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman WU. Thank you very much.
Dr. Ehlers.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I  apologize  to  you
and  to  the  witnesses  for  being  late,  but  in  fact,  I  was  giving  a
speech to a German American group very worried about technology
transfer.

87

Chairman  WU.  Dr.  Ehlers,  you  are  forgiven  as  the  only  Member

of Congress to have ever been late.

Mr. EHLERS. Yes, but I try to be on time.
But  it  is  ironic  to  come  from  that  conference  where  a  foreign
country  is  very  eagerly  trying  to  determine  how  we  do  technology
transfer  and  knowledge  transfer,  as  they  said,  and  learning  about
America and come here to this discussion.

First  of  all,  Dr.  Jeffrey,  I  am  very  pleased  that  you  are  heading
NIST. It is an institution I have had a soft spot for, for many years.
I  have  used  their  services  as  a  scientist.  I  served  on  the  review
panel  for  NBS,  as  it  was  called  back  then  where  I  really  got  to
know  the  inner  workings.  And  I  am  pleased  with  what  you  are
doing.

The  fact  that  it  is  in  NIST  instead  of  NBS  indicates  a  definite
change of function. Not in any way cutting back the traditional, but
adding to it things such as MEP, ATP. In other words, ways to di-
rectly assist the manufacturing in this country.

I  know  you  mentioned  earlier  that  the  Administration  has  some
disagreements  about  the  functions  of  the  MEP,  and  particularly
ATP.  Let  me  assure  you  that  they  are  wrong.  And  I  have  been
fighting a battle with them for some years. And I have always been
trying to find out who the little man in the basement of the White
House  is  that  holds  that  view,  and  I  have  yet  to  locate  him,  but
yet the attitude there is of that nature.

I  first  worked  with  MEP,  incidentally,  when  I  was  in  the  state
legislature  as  well.  It  is  a  good  program.  I  am  not  saying  it  can’t
be improved, and I am certainly willing to see a review and willing
to  look  at  new  ideas,  but  I  don’t  want  the  objective  of  that  review
to  be—to  change  MEP  for  ideological  reasons  rather  than  prag-
matic  reasons.  And  I  am  very  concerned  about  any  attempts  to
change it, and that is why the Congress has always fought this.

ATP  is  a  different  matter.  I  think  ATP  does  have  to  be  restruc-
tured. I think it should be resurrected in a restructured form. And
that could also be extremely useful. I will not defend the way it op-
erated  originally,  even  though  it  was  not  that  bad,  but  I  think  it
could be improved.

MEP can be improved as well, but it has to have the right moti-

vation.

I am not here castigating you, or anyone, and particularly in the
Administration,  but  I  am  very  concerned  about  those  ideologues,
who  simply  think  it  is  improper  for  the  Federal  Government  to  be
working  with  industry  in  the  way  it  does.  And  that  I  object  to
strongly,  because  other  countries  are  trying  to  find  out  how  we  do
it, because we do it so well. So it is actually idiotic to, on ideological
grounds, try to kill a program that is helping industry, helping our
nation, helping our economy. And I appreciate especially the report
of—pardon me, the quotation from Dr. Williams, quoting Benjamin
Franklin, who should be the patron saint of all industry and polit-
ical  leaders  in  this  country,  in  which  he  said,  ‘‘An  investment  in
knowledge always pays the best interest.’’

Just  yesterday,  I  testified  before  the  House  Budget  Committee,
along  with  Congressman  Rush  Holt,  my  fellow  physicist.  And  he
made  the  point,  too,  about  investments—that  there  is  no  expendi-
ture of money that we make in the federal budget that has a great-

88

er  return  than  investment  in  science  and  technology.  There  is  no
question about it. So we have to continue in that. And I say if you
want  to  review  MEP  and  modify  it  just  on  the  basis  of  making  a
good  program  better,  God  bless  you,  and  we  would  be  happy  to
work with you and help you.

But I would resist any impetus to do it on the basis of the beliefs
of  some  people  in  the  Administration  that  somehow  this  is  some-
thing  the  government  should  not  be  doing  and  that  we  have  to  re-
structure it because of some ideological beliefs.

I am not negative on the Administration. I appreciate what they
have  done.  I  appreciate  the  President.  He  is  a  good  man.  I  have
had  good  conversations  with  him  about  these  issues.  And  frankly,
he  is  in  tune  with  what  I  am  trying  to  do.  So  whoever  is  saying
that  the  Administration  ‘‘has  problems,’’  I  don’t  think  is  speaking
for the President.

Having  said  that  diatribe,  I  would  be  happy  to  hear  comments
from  anyone  on  the  panel  who  wishes  to  comment  on  my  diatribe.

Dr. Jeffrey.
Dr. JEFFREY. If I could add just a word.
Thank  you  very  much,  sir.  And  obviously,  I  have  one  point  that
I want to make sure does not get lost on this, and that, you know,
obviously we stand by—and I personally stand by to work with you
and anyone else on this committee, to try to improve any program,
and I look forward to that. So thank you.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Well,  since  you  got  three  Nobel  Prizes  in  10  years,
I don’t think we have to worry about improving their research pro-
gram,  at  this  point.  But  ATP  definitely  needs  improvement.  MEP
needs  some  tinkering,  and  I  think  that  is  the  best  approach  to
take.

I am sorry. My time has expired.
I yield back.
Chairman WU. I thank the gentleman.

Mr. EHLERS. The basement of the White House.
Chairman  WU.—that  he  has  been  looking  for—and  Mr.  Borrus,
we  are  going  to  get  to  you  eventually,  but  I  am  going  to  get  this
off my chest, first.

And Dr. Jeffrey, I love you like a brother. You have been terrific.
This is not directed at you. Let us consider you a conduit from this
end  of  Pennsylvania  Avenue  to  what  Dr.  Ehlers  has  referred  to  as
the  fellow  in  the  basement  that  he  hasn’t  been  able  to  find.  What
you have referred to as an ideology, but let us consider this a con-
versation with the philosopher in the White House who has repeat-
edly cut back on MEP, has repeatedly zeroed-out ATP, and I would
like to ask that philosopher—I mean, Dr. Jeffrey, you must be em-
barrassed to be here, because you are a scientist, and you just told
us that ATP is a fine program and is doing great things. Now, back
150  years,  would  that  philosopher  in  the  White  House  be  opposed
to  public  libraries  and  we  would  be  counting  on  Andre  Carnegie?
If  we  were  back  in  the  time  of  Abraham  Lincoln  and  there  were
debates when he was in the state legislature in Illinois, should the
public  be  involved  in  building  roads  and  canals  or  should  that  be

a  private  enterprise?  Merely  100  years  ago,  is  it  a  legitimate  role
for  the  Federal  Government  to  ban  child  labor  or  to  begin  to  work
toward  a  40-hour  work  week?  There  were  nine  old  men  across  the
street  who  felt  it  was  not  an  appropriate  role,  and  it  wasn’t  until
a while later, I am mixing my history a little bit, but it shook those
nine old men up enough that they started letting some of that leg-
islation  live  rather  than  stomping  it  out  over  at  the  Supreme
Court.

Now  moving  it  to  a  more  relevant  period,  space  exploration.
There  is  a  very  legitimate  role  for  the  private  sector  in  low-orbit
space  exploration.  But  there  are  some  folks  who  are  thinking  that
NASA could be replaced in deep space exploration, and quite frank-
ly, I just don’t think the numbers crunch.

Now that philosopher down at the other end of Pennsylvania Av-
enue  at  OMB  or  somewhere  else  within  a  deep  basement;  you
know,  I  have  always  said  this  Administration  would  privatize  ev-
erything  except  for  the  Marine  Corps.  Then  I  went  to  Iraq.  They
are  privatizing  the  Marine  Corps!  They  are  called  contractors,  and
I  don’t  know  how  many  of  them  there  are,  because  I  don’t  know
that anybody has ever done a count, but we are reducing our troop
numbers, and we are outsourcing the Marine Corps. At some point,
philosophy hits the hard wall of reality.

And I apologize to you for laying your ears back a little bit about
this,  but  it  is  not  directed  at  you,  Dr.  Jeffrey,  because  you  are  in
a very uncomfortable spot of being a scientist representing a bunch
of philosophers down at the other end of the street.

So just carry that message back, and tell me what they say over

a beer some time.

AVAILABILITY OF VENTURE CAPITAL

Mr.  Borrus,  the  Administration  asserts  that  there  is  plenty  of
venture  capital  funds.  And  you  say  there  isn’t.  Could  you  expand
a  little  bit  further  on  your  comments  about  where  venture  capital
has gone and why they are investing, shall we say, in more mature
technologies and not, perhaps, in seed round and bridging the ‘‘val-
ley of death’’?

Mr.  BORRUS.  Venture  investors  will  only  commit  large  amounts
of  capital  that  they  have  at  their  disposal  when  they  can  assess,
with  some  degree  of  specificity,  at  least  three  kinds  of  risks  that
venture investors look at. Technology risk, you know, is this some-
thing  that  is  at  all  possible  from  a  scientific  standpoint?  Can  it  be
achieved at an appropriate price performance points to have an im-
pact?  Market  risk,  is  there  a  growing  market  into  which  this  new
technological innovation has some hope of being sold by an innova-
tive  start-up,  not  a  large  established  business  that  already  has
well-established distribution counts? Is the market large enough to
generate  the  kind  of  return  that  venture  capitalists  look  for?  And
execution  risk,  is  this  a  team  that  can  be  built  to  execute  on  this
business idea?

In  a  certain  sense,  you  can  define  the  seed  stage  of  a  de  novo
start-up’s life as that point in time in which it is really not possible
yet to assess those kinds of risks. It is really the point of time when
you  need  to  have  a  leap  of  faith  and  believe  that  if  you  do  a  little
work and begin to transition an idea, a fledgling technology, a rudi-

mentary  bit  of  science,  out  of  the  lab  and  toward  the  commercial
marketplace,  that  you  can  begin  to  get  your  hands  around  tech-
nology risks, sales risks or market risks, and execution risks suffi-
ciently  to  then  convince  yourselves  it  is  worth  committing  a  large
amount  of  capital,  say  $5  to  $7  million  in  an  early  stage,  around
an investment and that you can earn the kind of return by commit-
ting  that  capital  that  you  need  to  earn  to  satisfy,  as  a  venture  in-
vestor, the investors who give you the money that you use to invest
(your limited partners).

And  so  the  bulk  of  the  industry  has  gotten  so  large  that  it  has
moved away from being willing to take those kinds of leaps of faith.
They have a lot of capital they need to commit. They can’t commit
it  into  small  increments  necessary  to  take  the  first  few  steps——
Chairman WU. Mr. Borrus, in some respects, the problem is that
it  takes  the  same  amount  of  due  diligence  to  invest  a  million  dol-
lars as it takes to invest $80 million?

Mr. BORRUS. Well, in some cases more. Yes.
Chairman WU. In some cases more due——
Mr. BORRUS. Thank you for——
Chairman WU.—diligence?
Mr. BORRUS. Thank you for making that point for me.
So——
Chairman WU. No, I didn’t want to interrupt your——
Mr.  BORRUS.  No.  No.  I  mean,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  if  you  look
at  the  data  that  the  National  Venture  Capital  Association  collects,
it is just very clear that the bulk of the industry is no longer doing
very early stage, seed-stage investing. There are still some venture
funds  at  the  early  stage  investing,  but  the  vast  bulk  of  the  money
that  is  spent  actually  goes  to  much  later  stages  in  the  start-up’s
life. It is not available for the riskiest——

Chairman  WU.  With  my  remaining  minute  and  a  half,  two  min-
utes, apparently, there is a philosophical disagreement at the other
end of the street, and there is a concern about picking winners and
losers.  How  would  you  try  to  address  the  picking  of  winners  and
losers, which some believe should be left to the private sector?

Mr.  BORRUS.  I  think  picking  winners  and  losers  is  a  profoundly
misleading  metaphor.  In  a  certain  sense,  it  is  to  substitute
sloganeering for a thorough understanding of how risky early stage
technology  innovation  actually  works.  No  investor,  neither  public
nor  private  investor,  picks  winners  and  losers.  Ultimately,  as  the
gentlemen to my left and right, I think, will testify, it is the market
that  picks  winners  and  losers,  by  which  I  mean,  of  course,  your
competitors on the one hand and your customers on the other.

So investors don’t pick winners and losers. What they do is they
plant  seeds.  In  this  particular  area  of  high-risk  innovation,  they
plant  technology  seeds.  And  in  the  planting  of  seeds,  there  is  a
well-defined,  historically-traditional  role  that  the  Federal  Govern-
ment can and should play of planting technology seeds in the areas
of  either  private  market  failure  or  acute  national  need.  And  that
is what ATP has done. That is what the Federal Government does
in other programs, and it is an essential role.

Chairman  WU.  Mr.  Borrus,  let  me  interrupt  you  just  with  my

last 30 seconds.

There  are  some  concerns  that  ATP  may  benefit  only  a  single
company. Others say that the benefit is broader than that, it casts
a broader shadow. What is your view of that particular discussion?

Mr. BORRUS. I think that view is completely, flatly wrong.
Look,  all  government  development  programs,  to  distinguish  it
from basic research funding, have to work through individual com-
panies in a market economy, such as ours.

In  ATP’s  case,  all  right,  the  measured  social  returns  of  the  pro-
gram  far  outstrip  the  total  program  dollars  spent  over  the  life  of
the  program,  as  a  whole,  and  of  course,  consequently,  dwarf  the
amount  of  dollars  going  to  any  individual  company.  The  resulting
social benefits, in the form of jobs, in the form of seeding new tech-
nology  industries  that  come  into  being,  in  the  form  of  consumer
benefits  are  exceptional,  substantial.  I  mean,  I  suggest  the  critics
who take that view ask those who have been diagnosed with breast
cancer  through  ATP-funded  digital  mammography  innovation  and
subsequently treated, because of the early detection that ATP-fund-
ed  innovation  enabled,  ask  them  whether  they  think  the  benefits
of the program only went to a company or two.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Borrus.  I  wanted  to  give  you  a

chance to finish answering the question.

And  Dr.  Jeffrey,  I  just  want  to  return,  for  a  moment.  Again,  I
still love you, but returning to that philosopher in the basement of
OMB,  you  know,  every  person  has  a  right  to  be  a  Luddite,  but  at
least  you  should  be  a  consistent  Luddite.  Now  we  provide  plenty
of funding at Department of Energy and other agencies that invest
in  private-sector  technology.  An  example  would  be  the  Hydrogen
Initiative,  the  Clean  Coal  Initiative,  over  at  the  CIA,  the  In-Q-Tel
project  that  has  been  doing  pretty  much  what  ATP  does.  And  Dr.
Jeffrey, if I were you, I would be really angry that they are letting
the CIA, in the investment realm, do things that they want to take
away from you.

And with that, I would like to turn to the gentleman from Michi-

gan, Dr. Ehlers.

JOINT UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND–NIST INSTITUTE

Mr.  EHLERS.  Well,  I  have  already  given  my  diatribe,  so  I  won’t

add to yours.

But  I  do  want  to  have  one  specific  question,  Dr.  Jeffrey,  that  I

am asking on behalf of the Committee.

You highlighted the recently-created joint institute with the Uni-
versity of Maryland. There is some concern. Was Maryland selected
through  a  peer-reviewed,  competitive  process  or  what—if  not,
what—why—how did this come about without peer review, if there
was no peer review?

Dr. JEFFREY. The review was done internally by looking at, basi-
cally,  the  statistics  that  the  National  Science  Foundation  and  Na-
tional Academy of Science have in terms of ranking different insti-
tutions,  in  terms  of  physics,  and  in  this  case,  since  it  is  a  physics-
based  institution,  that  looked  at  metrics  by  their  ranking  in  terms
of  their  publications,  the  grad  students,  the  ability  to  expand  into
the  quantum  era.  And  one  of  the  other  attributes  was  the  synergy
in  terms  of  the  expertise.  Maryland,  actually,  came  out  very  well.
The University of Maryland came out very well in all of those. And

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:12 Sep 10, 2007 Jkt 033107 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\021507\33107 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

92

one  very  important  point  is  that  Maryland  is  one  of  the  best  insti-
tutions  in  terms  of  condensed  matter  physics.  And  NIST  is,  essen-
tially,  one  of  the  best  institutions  in  the  purely  quantum  phe-
nomena.

What we end up with is that some of the work that we have been
doing  in  the  quantum  realm,  creating  new  forms  of  matter,  Bose-
Einstein condensates and Fermion condensates, we are basically at
the  point  where  we  have  got  the  quantum  physicists  that  have
been trained as quantum physicists creating these forms of matter
that  are  essentially  acting  sort  of  like  quantum  liquids.  And  we
have  another  entire  branch  of  physics,  condensed  matter  physics,
where the University of Maryland excels, that actually has a lot of
theory and nomenclature in that area. And by combining these two
institutions together, we actually believe that we can cross physics
disciplines and accelerate the field.

So we looked very hard at all of the various metrics that are kept
by  the  Academy  and  kept  by  the  Science  Foundation  and  made  a
determination.  We  then  did  put  out  a  Federal  Register  Notice  to
explain our intent, and we only had one university, other than the
University  of  Maryland,  that  came  back  and,  in  further  analysis
and discussions with them, they agreed they were not the right in-
stitution.

Mr. EHLERS. Now if you are going to be working on the Bose-Ein-
stein  condensate,  are  you  taking  that  work  away  from  the  sci-
entists at Boulder and—or is this supplementary or——

Dr. JEFFREY. Yes, this is definitely supplementary. This is not re-
moving  the  Nobel  Prize  winning  work  out  in  Colorado  at  all.  It  is
really extending beyond that.

Mr.  EHLERS.  I  see.  All  right.  Thank  you  very  much,  and  I  must
say I am intrigued by the Chairman’s words about the philosopher.
I had never thought of this person as being a philosopher, but since
I haven’t met that person, I don’t know.

With that comment, I would yield back.
Chairman WU. Dr. Ehlers, it is the task of this committee to ele-

vate all discussions.

Mr.  Borrus,  the  Federal  Government  has  invested,  to  date,  per-
haps a little bit over $7 billion in the National Nanotechnology Ini-
tiative over a multi-year period, and the Administration is request-
ing approximately another billion and a half investment in the Na-
tional  Nanotechnology  Initiative  for  fiscal  year  2008.  Their  jus-
tification  has  been  that  it  will  bring  about  the  development  of  a
whole  new  industrial  sector,  but  the  challenge  is  that  current  fed-
eral 
in
nanotechnology.  We  have  heard  from  the  nanotech  industry  about
the  gap  in  funding  between  research  and  having  proof  of  concept
getting to the point where it will attract venture funding.

focused  on  basic  research 

is  very  much 

In  your  view,  should  the  ATP  program  be  one  component  of  the

funding 

federal Nanotechnology Initiative?

Mr. BORRUS. To echo Mr. Hall, one word, yes.
Chairman WU. Thank you.
Now  we  do  live  in  a  world  of  budgetary  constraints.  Now  there
is  a  general  agreement,  and  we  hear  this  from  both  ends  of  Penn-
sylvania  Avenue  about  the  need  for  a  strong  innovation  agenda,
which includes significant funding increases for research and devel-

opment, and on my part, I hope for education, both K–12 and high-
er education.

Now the Administration has, thus far, focused primarily on basic
research  in  the  Competitiveness  Initiative.  Should  the  ATP  pro-
gram be a significant component of the federal innovation agenda?
And if it is a one-word answer yes, why?

Mr. BORRUS. Yes.
Why?  You  only  unleash  the  social  impacts  that  benefit  the  Na-
tion  when  you  transition  something  out  of  the  lab  and  into  the
commercial  marketplace.  As  I  have  tried  to  indicate,  there  are
some  major  gaps  in  financing  for  that  precise  part  of  the  problem.
And  you  have  to  bridge  that.  I  am  trying  to  fill  it,  but  I  obviously,
by  myself,  am  not  going  to  be  able  to  fill  very  much  of  it.  There
is  clearly  a  role  for  other  federal  funding  mechanisms,  and  in  par-
ticular for ATP, there as well.

And maybe I should elaborate on my nanotech piece. It is begin-
ning  to  trickle  out  a  little.  Many  of  the  things  I  look  at  and  con-
sider  investing  in  these  days  have  a  nanoscale-engineering  compo-
nent  to  it.  I  think,  by  the  way,  that  it  is  probably  wrong  to  think
about  nanotechnology  as  a  new,  emerging  industry.  It  is  a  tech-
nology  that  will  be  very  widely  applied  across  a  very  big  number
of industries. It is already beginning to transform chemistry, trans-
form material science, ultimately will have very significant impacts
in the manufacturing industries as well.

Facilitating  that  transition  holds  out  one  of  the  best  hopes  for
generating the kind of innovation and revival and continued leader-
ship  by  American  industry  as  a  whole,  that  can  sustain  a  growing
standard of living in this country in light of the challenges that we
face.

Chairman  WU.  Are  there  any  other  questions  from  the  members

present?

If not, I would just like to say that we all strongly support NIST,
and especially the NIST laboratories. They have done well in terms
of  federal  financial  support,  and  they  have  done  even  better  in
terms of their success. Three Nobel Prizes is just the tip of the ice-
berg. What we want is a balance between the laboratory enterprise
and the other very important things that NIST does. And we would
like,  we  will  insist  upon  a  sensible,  fact-based  set  of  policies  in
science  and  in  economics  for  our  economy’s  sake.  As  much  as  we
may  have  interesting  discussions  with  philosophers,  when  we  get
down  to  science  and  running  our  economy,  I  think  that  it  is  wise
to pay heed to fact-based, numbers-based constraints.

And Dr. Jeffrey, I would look forward to working with you to de-

velop that. I believe that you want to do that.

And I want to thank the panelists, all of you who made this jour-
ney  to  this  wonderful  frosted  town  today  to  make  significant  con-
tributions to this very, very important discussion.

I thank you all very much.
I want to thank all of you for coming. The witnesses are excused,

and this hearing is now adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 11:50 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  William  Jeffrey,  Director,  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Tech-

nology, Technology Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu

MEP
Q1. The Administration indicates that it believes its proposed cut to MEP can be ab-
sorbed by increased charges to small manufacturers, increases in efficiency, cost-
reduction  at  MEP  Centers,  and  consolidation  of  Centers.  Please  provide  the
Committee with the NIST analysis that justifies these claims.

A1. The annual reported benefits by manufacturing clients of the MEP Centers con-
ducted  through  an  independent  survey  demonstrates  a  significant  level  of  cost  sav-
ings and efficiency improvements for the MEP clients. For example, the latest MEP
client  survey  results  (released  January  2007  and  reflecting  FY  2005  benefits)  dem-
onstrate  that  MEP  helped  16,448  clients  create  and  retain  53  thousand  jobs;  in-
crease and retain sales of nearly $6.3 billion; and generated cost savings of just over
$1.3  billion  (both  recurring  and  non-recurring).  These  impacts  resulting  in  reduced
costs  and  potentially  increased  profits  for  the  client  could  be  used  to  support  in-
creased  fees  for  future  services.  With  increased  revenues  streams  from  client  fees,
MEP  centers  may  offset,  in  whole  or  in  part,  the  reduction  in  federal  funds.  The
FY 2008 Budget request would also encourage these Centers to be more efficient by
reducing their overhead costs, including marketing costs.
Q2. How many MEP Centers could be operated effectively under the proposed budget
of only $46 million? What analysis has NIST performed to arrive at this conclu-
sion?

A2. MEP  is  required  by  statute  to  use  a  merit-based  process  for  awarding  funds.
The  specifics  of  how  many  centers  and  where  they  might  be  located  is  unknown  at
this time. The MEP Director will work with the Centers to develop options that con-
sider  each  center’s  customer  base,  constraints,  and  opportunities.  Actions  taken  by
any center or group of centers will be assessed against their ability to maintain sup-
port  to  the  small  manufacturers.  If  the  requested  budget  is  enacted,  we  will  work
with  the  centers  to  examine  alternatives  and  optimize  the  best  plan  for  operating
at  the  $46.3  million  level  that  ensures  the  maximum  benefit  to  small  manufactur-
ers.
Q3. What  specific  discussions  has  NIST  held  with  MEP  Centers  and  their  state

funding agencies about the proposed 56 percent funding reduction?

A3. MEP  meets  quarterly  with  MEP  Center  Directors  and  uses  these  quarterly
meetings  to  discuss  information  such  as  the  Administration’s  federal  budget  prior-
ities and proposed MEP program operations under a reduced budget.

Additionally,  we  had  discussed  an  MEP  re-competition,  but  based  upon  inputs
from the MEP Center Directors, Congressional Members and Staff, and others it be-
came  clear  that  the  process  of  the  re-competition  would  be  disruptive  to  current
Center operations. We therefore decided not to hold this re-competition.
VCAT
Q4. How  did  you  incorporate  recommendations  from  the  Visiting  Committee  on  Ad-
vanced  Technology  (VCAT)  into  the  new  initiatives  in  the  FY08  budget,  includ-
ing  those  carried  over  from  the  FY07  request?  What  recommendations  did  the
VCAT make that were not included in the new initiatives?

A4. The Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology (VCAT) is a source of external
input  that  is  often  focused  around  the  expertise  of  the  individual  VCAT  members.
NIST takes into consideration VCAT input when developing new programs or evalu-
ating the course of current programs.

The  VCAT  is  only  one  of  many  sources  of  recommendations  that  NIST  considers
while  developing  new  programs  and  initiatives.  NIST  also  takes  into  account  Con-
gressional,  Administration,  and  Agency  priorities,  and  the  requirements  and  needs
of industry, business, and academic communities as well as the broad trends we see
in science and technology.

Shortly after arriving at NIST as the Director, Dr. Jeffrey tasked senior manage-
ment to develop a strategic vision for biosciences and health. NIST is working with
industry,  academia,  and  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  to  develop  this  vi-
sion,  of  which  the  FY07  bio-imaging  initiative  was  the  first  component.  This  is  an

ongoing  planning  process,  for  example,  NIST  is  developing  a  prospective  economic
study in the area of biopharmaceuticals that will be available this fiscal year.

The VCAT is very much involved in this process, and for this year’s VCAT meet-
ings,  decided  to  have  breakout  sessions  in  the  broad  areas  of  bioscience,
nanotechnology, and information technology to discuss strategies and industry needs
and opportunities with NIST staff.
National Research Council Review Process
Q5. You  have  made  two  major  changes  in  the  National  Research  Council  (NRC)  re-
view process: in December 2006 you directed the NRC to switch from a full-agen-
cy review of NIST to reviewing only half of the labs at a time, and you omitted
all  mention  of  assessing  cross-cutting  and  multi-disciplinary  programs  in  your
formal  charge  to  NRC.  Why  shouldn’t  the  NRC  review  all  of  NIST’s  programs
in  the  same  cycle,  and  why  should  it  not  provide  an  analysis  of  cross-cutting
work? What external review will be done of cross-cutting programs?

A5. Under the past system with annual reviews, the NRC report would often come
out in about January while the next review would be scheduled to start in approxi-
mately  March.  This  left  very  little  time  to  implement  recommendations  from  the
NRC report and properly measure the effectiveness of these changes.

The  new  biennial  review  process  is  consistent  with  the  recommendations  of  the
National  Academies  regarding  the  evaluation  of  R&D  programs.  Specifically,  the
National Academy’s Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy report ti-
tled Evaluating Federal Research Programs: Research and the Government Perform-
ance  and  Results  Act  states  that  the  useful  outcomes  of  basic  research  cannot  be
measured  directly  on  an  annual  basis  but  instead  highlights  the  need  for  assess-
ment that evaluates the quality and relevance of the research as well as the leader-
ship of that research, all of which are seen as good predictors of eventual usefulness.
The biennial review process directly addresses these metrics.

The  NRC  report  was  by  and  large  a  compilation  of  individual  laboratory  reports.
Cross-cutting  and  multi-disciplinary  program  reviews  were  only  tangentially  ad-
dressed. NIST’s new contract with NRC includes an explicit option for special stud-
ies  that  may  include  cross-cutting  issues  involving  not  only  the  NIST  Laboratories
but also from areas such as the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership pro-
gram.

In  addition  to  the  cross-cutting  and  multi-disciplinary  program  review  that  can
be  done  under  the  NRC  contract,  NIST’s  Visiting  Committee  on  Advanced  Tech-
nology also looks at NIST-wide programs.
VCAT and NIST Budget Initiatives
Q6. In its most recent report (FY05) the VCAT noted that biomedical technology cre-
ated ‘‘a unique opportunity and challenge for NIST.’’ The FY04–05 NRC assess-
ment of NIST recommended that NIST undertake ‘‘comprehensive, cross-labora-
tory  planning  efforts  in  both  the  biosciences  and  health.’’  However,  only  one  of
the  fourteen  combined  FY07  and  FY08  budget  initiatives  is  in  the  field  of  bio-
technology (Bio-imaging). How did NIST determine that these recommendations
were  of  low  priority,  and  what  is  NIST’s  plan  for  work  in  the  fields  of  bio-
sciences and health in FY08 and future years?

A6. NIST considers the input from many stakeholders and draws on many informa-
tion sources when developing new programs and initiatives and when evaluating the
course of current programs. NIST’s stakeholders include Congress and the Adminis-
tration,  as  well  as  industry,  the  business  community  and  academia.  The  methods
used  to  obtain  stakeholder  input  range  from  conducting  economic  impact  and  plan-
ning studies to outreach activities, such as the U.S. Measurement System study.

Topics  developed  from  these  stakeholder  feedback  processes  form  the  basis  for
many  proposed  initiatives  which  are  then  rigorously  evaluated  and  screened.  Each
initiative  is  evaluated  based  on  a  series  of  questions  including  the  difficulty  of  the
problem, the NIST role and cost, and the impact of the solution.

There  is  a  clear  need  for  improved  measurement  technologies  in  the  biosciences
and  health  related  research.  NIST’s  core  capabilities  are  sure  to  have  an  impact  in
the  measurements  and  standards  gap  that  exists  in  the  area  of  bio-imaging,  espe-
cially  as  it  relates  to  clinical  diagnostic  tools  such  as  MRI.  NIST  is  working  with
industry and academia to further evaluate the most significant and urgent measure-
ment barriers that, if addressed by NIST, would have most impact to U.S. bioscience
and health care industry.

Questions submitted by Representative Phil Gingrey

MEP
Q1. Please elaborate on and provide several examples of how the Manufacturing Ex-
tension  Partnership  program  leverages  the  applied  research  coming  out  of  our
nation’s  universities  to  help  small  and  medium-sized  manufacturers  compete  in
the  global  market  place.  We  know  this  type  of  assistance  requires  time  and  sig-
nificant  efforts,  yet  has  large  potential.  How  do  you  plan  to  continue  to  support
this activity while reducing the funding for the program?

A1. A  major  focus  of  the  MEP  program  is  to  build  upon  our  foundation  of  process
improvements with clients to develop innovation and growth services that will posi-
tion U.S. manufacturers to meet the increasing demands of the global marketplace.
Moving  research  from  universities  and  federal  labs  is  a  key  to  providing  manufac-
turers  with  access  to  the  technologies  needed  for  the  development  of  innovative
processes and new products. Recent examples include:

• The  Montana  Manufacturing  Extension  Center  (MMEC)  located  at  Montana
State  University  helped  Universal  Bio-availability  Environmental/Soil  Test
Inc.  (UNIBEST)  bring  to  the  marketplace  an  innovative  soil  analysis  device.
This ‘‘cherry tomato-sized’’ capsule is filled with unique resin beads that allow
direct analysis/measurement in the field, thereby reducing the amount of ma-
terial  that  must  be  transported  to  and  handled  in  a  laboratory.  In  addition
to  working  on  the  preliminary  design  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  ma-
chinery  for  the  soil  analysis  capsule,  MMEC  also  prepared  cost  estimates  for
the  design  and  fabrication.  The  capsules  for  soil  testing  currently  make  up
about  95  percent  of  UNIBEST  manufacturing  demand,  but  the  manufacturer
expects  that  to  change  because  they  are  working  to  obtain  EPA  approval  of
the same technology for use in environmental testing and monitoring.
• The  Oklahoma  Alliance  for  Manufacturing  Excellence—an  MEP  Center—was
instrumental  in  the  implementation  of  the  Oklahoma  Nanotechnology  Appli-
cations  Project  (ONAP).  The  ONAP  extends  financial  support  and  technical
services  for  the  application  of  nanotechnology  in  Oklahoma’s  manufacturing
and  business 
first  awardees,  SouthWest
NanoTechnology  (SWeNT),  manufactures  high  quality  carbon  nanotubes.
With the new manufacturing techniques developed at the University of Okla-
homa,  SWeNT  plans  to  diversify  its  manufacturing  processes  and  mass
produce  a  ‘‘commercial  grade’’  of  carbon  nanotubes  at  a  substantially  lower
price  than  is  currently  possible.  The  production  volumes  are  expected  to  in-
crease more than 30 fold while costs are expected to fall by 90 percent.

community.  One  of 

the 

The  FY  2008  Budget  request  would  maintain  a  network  of  MEP  centers  funded
according  to  their  performance  and  need,  and  would  encourage  these  Centers  to  be
more  efficient  by  reducing  their  overhead  costs,  including  marketing  costs.  Centers
could  also  ask  MEP  clients  to  cover  more  of  the  cost  of  the  services  through  mod-
estly increased fees.

Questions submitted by Representative Jim Matheson

MEP
Q1. An  OMB  justification  for  the  MEP  budget  cut  was  that  almost  20  percent  of
MEP  clients  are  manufacturing  firms  with  more  than  250  employees  and  these
firms  would  be  able  to  make  up  the  funding  difference  due  to  their  size.  Does
the  Administration  now  consider  manufacturers  with  more  than  250  employees
as  outside  the  traditional  definition  of  a  ‘‘small  business’’?  What  evidence  does
the Administration use that justifies MEP clients with more than 250 employees
can charge more for their services?

A1. I  am  unaware  of  the  OMB  justification  to  which  you  are  referring.  The  data
describing the fraction of MEP business serving clients with more than 250 employ-
ees  was  provided  by  the  MEP  in  their  analysis  of  their  business  (‘‘Making  a  Dif-
ference for America’s Manufacturers’’), and was not a delineation chosen by the Ad-
ministration.

In characterizing the size of clients, MEP uses the size guidance developed by the
Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Size Standards. In the current Table
of Small Business Size Standards, effective July 31, 2006, the majority of industries
with 500 or fewer employees are considered small businesses.

The  cost  savings  and  efficiency  improvements  reported  by  manufacturing  clients
of MEP Centers result in reducing costs to MEP’s clients and could be used to sup-
port  increased  fees  for  future  MEP  Center  services.  The  annual  reported  benefits
by  manufacturing  clients  of  the  MEP  Centers  conducted  through  an  independent
survey demonstrates a significant level of cost savings and efficiency improvements
for  the  MEP  clients.  For  example,  the  latest  MEP  client  survey  results  (released
January 2007 and reflecting FY 2005 benefits) suggest that MEP helped 16,448 cli-
ents create and retain 53 thousand jobs; increase and retain sales of nearly $6.3 bil-
lion;  and  generated  cost  savings  of  just  over  $1.3  billion  (both  recurring  and  non-
recurring).  These  impacts  resulting  in  reduced  costs  and  potentially  increased  prof-
its  for  the  client  could  be  used  to  support  increased  fees  for  future  services.  With
increased  revenues  streams  from  client  fees,  MEP  centers  may  offset,  in  whole  or
in part, the reduction in federal funds.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Submitted  to  R.  Stanley  Williams,  Senior  HP  Fellow  in  Quantum  Science  Research,

Hewlett-Packard Corporation

These questions were submitted to the witness, but were not responded to by the

time of publication.

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu
Q1. Your  testimony  points  out  that  the  mission  creep  at  NIST  has  stretched  the  sci-
entific  staff  very  thin.  What  are  the  possible  consequences  for  U.S.  industry  if
NIST  starts  to  lag  behind  in  its  core  measurement  and  standards  role?  What
NIST  missions  are  falling  behind,  or  are  in  danger  of  falling  behind,  because
of this mission creep?

Q2. You recommend that NIST should resist the temptation of adding new programs
in  FY08  to  justify  a  funding  increase  until  it  is  clear  that  current  missions  are
adequately  served.  How  do  you  suggest  that  NIST  seek  outside  evaluation  for
determining  whether  current  mission  needs  are  being  met?  Are  the  current  re-
view  by  the  National  Research  Council  and  input  from  the  Visiting  Committee
on Advanced Technology sufficient?

and  Technology’s  (NIST)  research  budget  over  the  next  ten  years,  what  process
do you think NIST should use to prioritize where it spends this new money? For
example,  do  you  believe  NIST  should  perform  a  formal  needs  assessment  with
involvement from the external community to prioritize its research?

Responses by Michael Borrus, General Partner, X/Seed Capital

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu
Q1. How has the role of U.S. venture capital for high-technology companies changed
in  the  last  five  years?  Is  there  still  a  need  for  early-stage  seed  funding  that  can
be filled by the Advanced Technology Program (ATP)?

A1. Answered  in  submitted  written  and  oral  testimony  and  throughout  oral  re-
sponses (see pp. 40–44, pp. 89–93).
Q2. The  ATP  has  been  characterized  by  its  opponents  as  ‘‘picking  winners  and  los-

ers’’ among technology companies. Do you agree with this characterization?

A2. See oral responses, p. 90.
Q3. The  Federal  Government  has  invested  more  than  $7  billion  in  the  National
Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) over the past six years, and the Administration
is requesting $1.45 billion for FY08. Does the ‘‘valley of death’’ lack of early-stage
seed  funding  for  technology  start-ups  also  exist  in  the  field  of  nanotechnology?
In your view, should the ATP be a component of a federal nanotechnology initia-
tive? If so, why?

Question submitted by Representative Phil Gingrey
Q1. Given  that  the  President  intends  to  double  the  National  Institute  of  Standards
and  Technology’s  (NIST)  research  budget  over  the  next  ten  years,  what  process
do you think NIST should use to prioritize where it spends this new money? For
example,  do  you  believe  NIST  should  perform  a  formal  needs  assessment  with
involvement from the external community to prioritize its research?

A1. As one of the very best federal research labs, NIST has scientists who are fully
competent  to  determine  the  institution’s  research  priorities  and  they  should  con-
sequently  be  accorded  a  very  substantial  role  in  the  priority-setting  process.  How-
ever, NIST is also the primary federal research lab entrusted with interacting with
essentially  all  U.S.  industries—because  all  rely  on  metrology—and  with  playing  a
significant  role  to  enhance  long-term  U.S.  technological  competitiveness.  Con-
sequently, NIST should also solicit substantial input from Universities and from the
broad  private  sector  in  setting  priorities.  A  formal  needs  assessment  with  input
from the relevant external communities—including, inter alia, the academic science
and  technology  communities,  technology-intensive  industries,  long-term  technology
investors—would indeed insure that NIST priorities rested on the strongest possible
foundation of insight into future needs.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Question submitted by Chairman David Wu
Q1. The Administration indicates that it believes its proposed cut to MEP can be ab-
sorbed by increased charges to small manufacturers, increases in efficiency, cost-
reduction at MEP Centers, and consolidation of Centers. Do you agree with this
assessment? How would the proposed cut affect the Oregon MEP?

A1. I do not agree with this assessment for the following reasons:

A. Increased charges to small manufacturers will reduce revenues and force the

MEPs to seek larger manufacturing clients,

B. I am on the board of the Oregon MEP and feel that the organization is very

well run and has little to no room to absorb further cost reduction and,

A1. Because  NIST  plays  such  a  significant  role  in  establishing  standards  for  tech-
nical applications across our country, we should develop a clear process for aligning
the  private  sector  with  the  important  standards  setting  for  the  benefit  it  provides
across the Nation. I believe that a needs assessment would be useful. It would allow
and  provide  a  catalyst  for  private  science  to  benefit  from  a  government  body  and
optimize  the  needed  change  process;  especially  in  the  manufacturing  sector.  Our
county  is  being  out-paced  by  other  countries  globally  serving  a  global  market.  The
MEP represents a national tool for manufacturing system changes that requires an
education of the decision-makers so that our U.S. based companies can compete ‘‘on
a  level  playing  field.’’  The  MEP  provides  the  needed  support.  We  should  try  to  en-
hance it’s ability, not restrict it.

STATEMENT OF DARYL G. HATANO
VICE PRESIDENT, PUBLIC POLICY

SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION

The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) appreciates the opportunity to sub-
mit  testimony  on  the  importance  of  NIST  to  the  competitiveness  of  the  U.S.  semi-
conductor industry.

The  SIA  strongly  supports  doubling  NIST  as  envisioned  in  President  Bush’s
American Competitiveness Initiative and the House Democrats Innovation Agenda’s
call for a doubling of basic research in the physical sciences across all agencies.

Today I would like to share the impact of semiconductor technology advances, the
role NIST metrology research plays in furthering these advances, and NIST’s poten-
tial  contributions  to  the  challenges  we  face  as  we  approach  the  physical  limits  of
our current technology. Simply put, the country whose companies are first to market
in this technology transition will likely lead the coming nanoelectronics era the way
the U.S. has led for half a century in microelectronics, and NIST can play a critical
role in ensuring that America earns this leadership position.
NIST Contributes to U.S. Semiconductor Competitiveness

The semiconductor industry employs 234,000 people across the U.S., directly con-
tributes  $60  billion  to  U.S.  GDP  and  is  America’s  largest  export  sector.  The  U.S.
industry  has  46  percent  of  the  $248  billion  world  semiconductor  market,  down  four
percentage  points  from  the  50  percent  market  share  in  2000  but  still  about  twice
that of the next leading industry.

SIA’s support for increased NIST funding is part of our overall innovation agenda
calling  for  a  doubling  of  funding  for  NSF,  NIST,  Department  of  Energy  Office  of
Science;  $20  million  for  the  Defense  Department  to  co-fund  with  industry  the  uni-
versity  Focus  Center  Research  Program;  increased  availability  of  green  cards  and
H–1Bs  visas  through  immigration  reform;  increasing  the  number  of  science,  tech-
nology,  engineering  and  math  graduates  and  improved  K–12  math,  science  edu-
cation; a permanent and enhanced R&D credit; and increased awareness of the im-
pact of foreign tax incentives.
The Exponential Increase in Transistors Drives Economic Growth

As the enabling technology behind computers, telecommunications, consumer elec-
tronics,  and  the  Internet,  the  industry’s  ability  to  continually  make  better,  faster,
and cheaper chips is driving increased productivity and creating more jobs through-
out the economy.

For  over  three  decades  the  industry  has  followed  Moore’s  Law,  which  states  that
the  number  of  transistors  on  a  chip  will  double  every  eighteen  months.  The  tran-
sistor is the basic building block within the semiconductor chip and can be thought
of  as  an  electronic  switch  or  as  retaining  one  bit  (a  one  or  a  zero)  in  memory.  The
transistor  is  composed  of  a  series  of  precisely  etched  and  deposited  layers  of  mate-
rials  and  semiconductors,  with  as  many  as  two  billion  transistors  integrated  on  a
single silicon chip, are the most complex product manufactured on the planet.

Today the cost of making one million transistors is one penny.
The  impact  of  Moore’s  Law  on  our  economy  is  immense.  Harvard  economist  Dale
Jorgenson has noted that ‘‘The economics of Information Technology begins with the
precipitous  and  continuing  fall  in  semiconductor  prices.’’  Professor  Jorgenson  quan-
tified  the  rapid  adoption  of  IT  in  the  U.S.  for  driving  substantial  economic  growth
in  the  U.S.  gross  domestic  product  since  1995,  concluding  ‘‘Since  1995,  Information
Technology  industries  have  accounted  for  25  percent  of  overall  economic  growth,
while  making  up  only  three  percent  of  the  GDP.  As  a  group,  these  industries  con-
tribute  more  to  economy-wide  productivity  growth  than  all  other  industries  com-
bined.’’ 1

To  see  the  impact  of  the  productivity  gains  on  a  single  sector,  it  is  instructive  to
consider  the  benefits  the  government  (Federal,  State,  and  local)  receives  as  a  con-
sumer of semiconductors. The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Anal-
ysis  has  data  indicating  that  the  government  sector  of  the  economy  purchased  $8.1
billion  of  computers  in  2004,  but  that  they  would  have  had  to  spend  $46.7  billion
for that same amount of computing power if they had to pay 1995 prices. The cumu-
lative benefit from technology improvements and resulting price declines from 1995
to 2004 is $181 billion of ‘‘free’’ computing. In this tight budget year, it is important
to  remember  that  the  federal  investments  made  to  support  basic  research  are  not

only  beneficial  to  the  overall  U.S.  economy,  but  also  allows  the  government  itself
to do more with less as a result of falling computing costs.
The Roadmap Sets a Timetable for Technology Advances

To  continue  the  exponential  growth  of  the  number  of  transistors  on  a  chip,  over
800  hundred  chip  experts  around  the  world  contribute  to  ‘‘The  International  Tech-
nology  Roadmap  for  Semiconductors’’  (ITRS).2 The  North  American  participation  of
the  ITRS  is  under  the  auspices  of  the  SIA.  NIST  has  been  a  strong  supporter  of
the  ITRS—in  fact  one  of  the  first  meetings  of  what  is  now  the  ITRS  was  held  at
NIST’s Boulder, Colorado facility. Today NIST co-chairs and has four people on the
Metrology  technical  working  group,  and  also  has  representatives  on  the  Emerging
Research Devices and Materials, Assembly and Packaging, Factory Integration, and
RF for Wireless working groups.

The ITRS identifies the milestones that must be reached in all aspects of semicon-
ductor  manufacturing  for  technology  trends  such  as  Moore’s  law  to  continue.  One
example  of  a  roadmap  characteristic  is  microprocessor  transistor  gate  lengths—a
critical  dimension  that  affects  the  processor’s  speed.  When  SIA  testified  about  the
NIST  budget  before  this  committee  in  2004,  the  transistor  gate  length  was  37
nanometers.3 This  year  it  will  shrink  to  only  25  nanometers,  and  it  is  targeted  to
decrease  from  14  nanometers  in  2012  and  eight  nanometers  in  2017.  (Note:  a
nanometer  is  one-billionth  of  a  meter.  A  human  hair  is  100,000  nanometers  in
width,  and  a  red  blood  cell  is  5,000  nanometers  in  width.)  If  these  and  other  mile-
stones identified in the ITRS are reached, microprocessors would be five times fast-
er.4

The  ITRS  lists  the  technical  barriers  at  each  stage  of  production  that  must  be
overcome  if  we  are  to  continue  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  chip  technology  advances.
One  important  set  of  challenges  is  in  the  area  of  metrology.  New  metrology  tools
and techniques are needed to accurately perform critical measurements as new ma-
terials, processes, and device structures are introduced.

About  100  key  measurements  and  controls  have  been  identified  by  the  ITRS  me-
trology  working  group  as  critical  to  future  semiconductor  technology  advances  from
now until 2020. Examples of the types of metrology challenges confronting industry
over this timeframe are:

• Integrating metrology at the factory level;
• Measuring  the  thickness  of  layers  deposited  on  a  wafer,  the  lengths  of  tran-
sistor  gates,  and  the  aspect  ratio  of  the  depth  and  width  of  trenches  etched
on a chip;

• Measuring the roughness of line edges at the nanoscale;
• Detecting impurities in new substrates; and
• Insuring  that  metrology  within  a  chip  accounts  for  variations  across  a  single

chip and across a wafer with hundreds of chips.

NIST’s Ability To Meet The Challenges Has Not Kept Pace With Advance Of

Technology

NIST  is  the  leader  in  semiconductor  metrology  research.  Its  6th  annual
nanoelectronics  metrology  conference  next  month  is  expected  to  attract  250
attendees  from  all  over  the  world  and  the  conference  proceedings  will  be  published
by  the  American  Institute  of  Physics.  However  NIST’s  efforts  are  insufficient  given
the  magnitude  of  the  technical  challenges  that  must  be  overcome  to  continue  the
current  rate  of  technology  advances.  As  an  indication  of  the  shortfall,  NIST  spend-
ing on semiconductor research has only increased 35 percent since 1995. As an indi-
cation of the growing technical challenge as circuits continue to shrink, the semicon-
ductor industry’s total investment in R&D increased 143 percent during that period.

Support for increased funding for NIST semiconductor work has come from many
quarters. In February 2005 the Defense Science Board Task Force on High Perform-
ance  Microchip  Supply  issued  a  report  that  concluded  ‘‘Semiconductor  technology
and manufacturing leadership is a national priority that must be maintained if the
U.S.  military  is  to  continue  to  lead  in  the  application  of  electronics  to  support  the
warfighter.’’ 5 In  its  list  of  recommendations,  the  DSB  singled  out  a  NIST  increase
as a key element in a program to keep U.S. leadership in semiconductors:

‘‘NIST  is  best  positioned  to  focus  research  on  many  of  the  metrology  challenges
identified  in  the  International  Technology  Roadmap  for  Semiconductors.  When
it was established in 1994, the NIST Office of Microelectronics Programs was to
start  at  $12  million  in  annual  funding  and  grow  to  $25  million.  This  level  was
not achieved, but this task force considers this activity an important contribution
to the national microelectronics supply issue.’’ 6

Finding a New Switch

We are beginning to reach the fundamental limits of the CMOS,7 the process that
has  been  the  basis  for  the  semiconductor  industry  for  the  past  30  years.  By  intro-
ducing new materials into the basic CMOS structure and devising new CMOS struc-
tures  and  interconnects,  further  improvements  in  CMOS  can  continue  for  the  next
ten  to  fifteen  years,  at  which  time  CMOS  begins  to  reach  its  physical  (layers  only
a  few  atoms  thick)  and  power  dissipation  limits.  For  the  U.S.  economy  to  continue
to  benefit  from  the  information  technology  productivity  improvements  described
above, there will need to be a ‘‘new logic switch’’ to replace the current CMOS-based
transistor.

There  are  a  number  of  candidates  for  the  new  switch,  including  spintronics
(changing a particle’s spin) and molecular electronics (changing a molecule’s shape).
There  are  many  metrology  challenges  as  scientists  search  for  the  new  switch.  For
example,  molecular  electronics  advances  require  the  measurement  of  intrinsic  mo-
lecular conduction in single molecules and in ∼2 nm thick molecule monolayers. Ad-

vances  in  spintronics  will  require  development  of  capabilities  to  measure  spin  den-
sities and material polarization at the nm-size scale.

To  identify  the  new  logic  switch  to  replace  the  transistor,  the  SIA  has  launched
the  Nanoelectronics  Research  Initiative  (NRI)  that  pulls  together  semiconductor
companies,  23  universities  in  12  states,  State  governments,  and  the  National
Science  Foundation.  The  House  Appropriations  Committee  report  singled  out  the
NSF’s work with the NRI as well as its Silicon Nanoelectronics and Beyond program
and encouraged such work to be continued.8 NIST scientists have been participating
in NRI meetings and SIA and NRI are discussing with NIST officials how this par-
ticipation might be expanded.

NIST involvement in the effort to find a new switch is absolutely critical. As noted
at the outset of this testimony, the country whose companies are first to market will
likely  lead  the  coming  nanoelectronics  era  the  way  the  U.S.  has  led  for  half  a  cen-
tury  in  microelectronics.  The  impact  on  the  U.S.  economy  and  national  security
should the U.S. not lead in the nanoelectronics is unfathomable.
SIA  Recommendations  to  Congress  for  NIST  and  Other  Research  Agencies
The SIA supports a significant increase for the NIST Scientific and Technical Re-
search  Services  for  FY  2008  along  the  lines  of  the  Administration’s  budget  request
and  the  House  Democrats  Innovation  Agenda’s  call  for  a  doubling  of  basic  research
in the physical sciences across all agencies within five years. In particular SIA sup-
ports  the  increased  funding  for  the  newly  created  NIST  Center  for  Nanoscale
Science  and  Technology  which  will  engage  in  research  on  many  of  the  challenges
outlined in this testimony, and full funding of the facilities budget for the Advanced
Measurement Laboratory.

in  particular 

The  budget  increases  at  NIST  aimed  at  metrology  issues  should  be  done  in  con-
cert  with  increased  appropriations  for  other  programs  in  semiconductor  research  at
universities.  SIA  supports  the  significant  increases  in  the  NSF  budget  envisioned
by  the  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  and  the  House  Democrats’  Innovation
Agenda;  and 
on  National
Nanotechnology  Initiative.  SIA  also  urges  Congress  to  appropriate  $10  million  for
the  Defense  Department’s  Government-Industry  Co-sponsorship  of  University  Re-
search  program.9 Coupled  with  an  expected  $10  million  from  DARPA,  this  appro-
priation would allow the Defense Department to leverage $20 million from industry
to  fund  the  $40  million  Focus  Center  Research  Program  that  supports  semicon-
ductor research at 38 universities across the country.10
Summary

encourages 

increased 

funding 

NIST  defines  its  mission  as  ‘‘To  promote  U.S.  innovation  and  industrial  competi-
tiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that
enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.’’ There is no better oppor-
tunity  for  NIST  to  fulfill  its  mission  than  to  expand  its  interactions  with  the  semi-
conductor  industry  and  solve  the  metrology  challenges  associated  with  advancing
CMOS  technology  to  its  ultimate  limits  and  finding  a  new  switch  to  ultimately  re-
place CMOS technology.

For  the  past  five  decades,  semiconductors  have  become  ever  faster,  better,  and
cheaper, and today are a major driver of growth in economic productivity. Congress
must increase the NIST laboratory budget if the country is to continue to enjoy the
benefits of every increasing semiconductor capabilities at ever decreasing costs.

8 ‘‘The Committee commends NSF for its Silicon Nanoelectronics and Beyond program and its
partnership  with  the  Nanoelectronics  Research  Initiative,  which  involves  the  sponsorship  of  re-
search  in  the  areas  of  information’  technology  and  electronics.  The  Committee  encourages  NSF
to  continue  its  support  for  such  research  in  Fiscal  year  2007.’’  House  Report  109–118—Science,
