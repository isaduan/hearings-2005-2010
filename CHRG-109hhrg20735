U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Priorities in the Department of Energy

Budget for Fiscal Year 2006

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 27, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

1. Purpose

On  Wednesday,  April  27,  2005,  the  Energy  Subcommittee  of  the  House  Science
Committee  will  hold  a  hearing  on  the  Department  of  Energy’s  fiscal  year  2006
(FY06) budget request.
2. Witnesses

• Dr. Ray Orbach is the Director of the Office of Science at DOE. He has held
this  position  since  2002.  Prior  to  joining  the  Department,  Dr.  Orbach  was
Chancellor of the University of California at Riverside.

• Mr.  Douglas  Faulkner  is  the  Principal  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  En-
ergy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  (EERE).  Before  assuming  his  post  in
EERE, Mr. Faulkner’s federal career included service as a senior policy advi-
sor to two Secretaries of Energy.

• Mr. Mark R. Maddox is the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fossil
Energy (FE) at DOE. Prior to joining FE, Mr. Maddox served as Senior Policy
Advisor to the Secretary of Energy. Prior to coming to DOE in 2003, Mr. Mad-
dox was Director of Communications and Public Affairs for a division of Lock-
heed  Martin,  Inc.  that  is  now  called  Affiliated  Computer  Services  State  and
Local Solutions, Inc.

• Mr.  Robert  Shane  Johnson  is  the  Deputy  Director  for  Technology,  the  Of-
fice  of  Nuclear  Energy,  Science  and  Technology.  He  has  previously  served  as
Associate  Director  for  Advanced  Nuclear  Research,  and  as  the  Associate  Di-
rector for Technology and International Cooperation. Prior to coming to DOE,
he was employed with Duke Power Company and Stoner Associates, Inc.

• Mr.  Kevin  Kolevar  is  the  Director  of  the  recently  renamed  Office  of  Elec-
tricity  Delivery  and  Energy  Reliability  (a  merger  of  the  Office  of  Electricity
Transmission and Distribution, and the Office of Energy Assurance) at DOE.
Prior to his appointment, Kolevar served as Chief of Staff to then-Deputy Sec-
retary of Energy Kyle McSlarrow, and as a senior advisor to the U.S.-Canada
Task  Force  that  investigated  the  2003  blackout.  Before  coming  to  DOE,
Kolevar served on the staffs of Senators Spencer Abraham and Connie Mack.

3. Overarching Questions

• How  does  the  Department  determine  the  appropriate  balance  between  near-
and  longer-term  technologies  in  its  applied  programs?  When  technologies  are
proven and ready for wider use, how does the Department help get them into
the marketplace? What is the appropriate role for industry in this effort?
• How is White House guidance to science and technology agencies reflected in
the activities funded by the DOE budget? In particular, does the DOE budget
reflect  the  emphasis  on  potentially  high-payoff  activities  that  will  help
achieve  the  long-term  national  goals  of  security  and  energy  independence?
Should  other  policy  considerations,  such  as  current  energy  prices  and  sup-
plies, factor into these decisions?
• In  addition,  there  are  a  series  of  program-specific  concerns  that  the  Com-
mittee  would  like  to  explore.  See  the  specific  issue  areas  and  Questions  to
Witnesses in Section 5.

4. Background and Issues

(Background  and  issues  are  presented  for  DOE  as  a  whole  and  then  for  each  of

the programs on which the hearing will focus.)

A) OVERALL DOE R&D
BACKGROUND:

The  $5.4  billion  DOE  R&D  funding  request  for  FY06  is  divided  among  the  five
offices  represented  at  this  hearing:  The  Office  of  Science  (SC)  funds  basic  research
at universities and 10 National Laboratories. The Office of Science contributes over
40 percent of all federal funds for civilian physical sciences research. The other four
offices run applied R&D programs.

U.S.  Energy  Context:  The  applied  energy  R&D  request  of  $1.95  billion  represents
3.1 percent of the civilian science and technology budget.1 The research is designed
to affect the energy sector of the economy, which constituted 7.2 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) in 2002.2 Energy may have an even larger influence on pol-
icy  than  its  direct  economic  impact,  due  to  its  implications  for  foreign  policy,  and
because virtually every other product or service in the economy requires some input
of energy for its production and/or delivery.

DOE  R&D  in  Budget  Context:  The  President  is  proposing  to  spend  $60.8  billion
on  all  civilian  R&D  in  the  fiscal  year  (FY)  2006  budget,  or  about  2.3  percent  of  the
total proposed $2.57 trillion budget.3 Of the amount proposed for total civilian R&D,
8.9  percent  would  go  to  DOE.  Table  1  below  breaks  down  the  proposed  DOE  R&D
budget.

1Not including Department of Homeland Security funding.

page 77. Denominator (GDP) from the year 2002 data in the President’s 2005 Budget: Historical
Tables, page 184.

3 To  calculate  civilian  R&D  the  Committee  began  with  the  Federal  Science  and  Technology
(FS&T)  budget  (The  Budget  of  the  United  States:  Analytical  Perspectives,  pp.  66–67)  and  sub-
tracted defense and homeland security basic and applied research.

ISSUES:
Does  the  proposed  budget  strike  the  appropriate  balance  between  the
physical sciences and the life sciences? Funding for medical and life science re-
search  at  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  has  more  than  doubled  over  the
past  decade,  while  funding  for  research  in  the  physical  sciences  has  remained  flat
(see  Figure  1).  Given  the  contribution  to  the  economy  of  physical  science  research
through  technology  development  and  the  need  in  biosciences  for  the  tools  created
by physics research, some experts fear the balance in federal research funding may
have shifted too far. DOE is the largest single funder of non-defense physical science
research.

What are the criteria the Department uses to ‘‘graduate’’ activities from the
laboratory to the demonstration phase? Demonstration projects are both a use-
ful  step  in  developing  technologies  and  a  means  to  stimulate  commercialization  of
mature technologies. However, in particular programs, such as the hydrogen initia-
tives  and  in  the  FutureGen  project,  there  seems  to  be  an  emphasis  on  very  expen-
sive  demonstration  projects  even  though  there  are  still  major  obstacles  to  be  over-
come by basic research (i.e., high technical risk). Recently the Department has char-
acterized  some  of  these  major  projects  as  ‘‘learning  demonstrations,’’  and  said  they
are  necessary  to  understand  the  challenges  facing  new  technologies.  The  specific
characteristics  that  distinguish  a  ‘‘learning  demonstration’’  from  other  demonstra-
tions  are  unclear.  It  is  also  unclear  whether  demonstrations  could  take  place  at  a
smaller scale that would provide the same lessons at a lower price.
Does  the  proposed  budget  strike  the  appropriate  balance  among  applied
energy  programs?  The  proposed  budget  reflects  a  continuing  shift  in  emphasis
away  from  energy  efficiency  R&D,  with  the  exception  of  activities  supporting  the
President’s hydrogen initiatives. Other trends are less clear. (See Figure 2.)

Assuming the budget proposal is approved, since FY01, funding for hydrogen and
fuel  cell  activities  will  have  increased  by  172  percent;  funding  for  Nuclear  Energy,
including  shifts  related  to  new  laboratory  costs,  will  have  increased  by  39  percent;
and  funding  for  Fossil  Energy  R&D  will  have  increased  by  11  percent  (even  with
the elimination of oil and gas R&D programs). Funding for Office of Electricity De-
livery  and  Energy  Reliability  programs,  despite  a  decline  in  the  request  for  FY06,
will have increased by 87 percent, following a large increase in the wake of the Au-
gust  2003  blackout.  In  contrast,  funding  for  Renewable  Energy  R&D,  excluding  the
Hydrogen  fuel  initiative,  will  have  dropped  by  13  percent;  and  funding  for  Energy
Efficiency R&D (excluding fuel cells), which received a significant increase in FY02,
will have been reduced by 15 percent.
Is  the  proposed  management  approach  to  large  demonstration  projects
such  as  FutureGen  and  Next  Generation  Nuclear  Plant  the  right  mecha-
nism  to  ensure  efficient  operation  and  oversight  of  federally  funded
projects?  The  Fossil  Energy  and  Nuclear  Energy  Offices  have  chosen  a  unique
management  structure  for  two  large  demonstration  projects.  The  structure  would
create  private-sector  consortia—project  integrators—to  manage  both  oversight  and
operations.  One  immediate  question  posed  by  this  proposed  arrangement  is:  what
is the liability of the Federal Government in the event that the private-sector part-
ners walk away from the project before the demonstration is completed?

B) OFFICE OF SCIENCE
BACKGROUND:

Budget  Highlights:  As  shown  in  Table  2,  the  Administration’s  FY06  budget  re-
quest for DOE’s Office of Science proposes a reduction of 3.8 percent, from the $3.6
billion  FY05  enacted  level.  The  Administration  describes  this  as  a  1.6  percent  de-
crease if one excludes $79.6 million in Congressional earmarks. This request is nine
percent  below  the  $3.8  billion  authorized  in  H.R.  6,  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005,
which was passed by the House on April 21, 2005 by a vote of 249–183.
ISSUES:
If budgets continue to decline, will research grants continue to suffer a dis-
proportionate  share  of  the  cuts?  Over  the  last  several  years,  funding  from  the
Office of Science has been approximately equally split between research grants and
facilities (both operations and construction). Over the last two years, the proportion
of funding for research grants has declined. The proposal for FY06 would exacerbate
this  trend:  the  cuts  to  research  grants  are  proportionally  larger  than  for  facilities
funding, with research grants cut 10 percent (versus a four percent cut to the Office
of Science). If this trend were to continue, DOE’s Science programs could potentially
change  in  character,  with  DOE  acting  primarily  as  a  facility  provider  for  research
activities  funded  by  others.  This  trend  might  also  have  a  disproportionate  effect  on
the 15,000 graduate students supported through DOE grants. It is not clear whether
DOE  has  made  a  deliberate  choice  to  move  toward  a  facility-based  program  or  the
emphasis on facilities is a temporary condition to cope with tight budgets.
Do the current trends imply closure of major Office of Science facilities or
even  an  entire  National  Laboratory?  In  2004,  the  Office  of  Science  released  a
20-Year Facilities plan that prioritize the needs of the scientific community over the
next two decades. That plan implicitly assumed increases in funding similar to those
included  in  H.R.  6,  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  (and  its  predecessor  legislation).  The
trends in the past two years’ budget requests are at odds with the plan. The budget
and future projections create a conflict between demand for new facility construction
and operation of existing facilities. For example, in the Nuclear Physics budget, the
need  to  operate  the  Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider  (RHIC)  at  Brookhaven  Labora-
tory  and  the  Continuous  Electron  Beam  Accelerator  Facility  at  the  Jefferson  Lab-
oratory  compete  for  funds  with  the  plan  to  construct  the  Rare  Isotope  Accelerator
facility. Similar competition arises between the proposed international fusion experi-
ment,  ITER,  and  the  operation  of  domestic  facilities.  DOE  has  not  explained  how
it  will  deal  with  planning  for  facilities  given  the  tight  fiscal  environment  expected
for the next few budget cycles.
How does DOE make tradeoffs between operation of existing facilities and
construction of new ones? The emphasis in the FY06 request is on fully funding
operations for the newest facilities such as the Spallation Neutron Source ($74 mil-
lion)  and  the  four  new  Nanoscale  Science  Research  Centers  ($43  million)  at  Oak
Ridge,  Sandia,  Argonne,  and  Brookhaven  National  Laboratories.  There  are  several
recently  constructed  facilities  that  will  have  operations  severely  curtailed,  however.
For  example,  RHIC  will  only  operate  for  12  weeks  under  the  proposal,  seven  of
which  are  required  for  warm-up  and  calibration  activities.  This  compares  with  32

8

weeks during FY05. As a result, physics activities at this facility will have been re-
duced by 80 percent.

C) OFFICE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY
BACKGROUND:

Budget  Highlights:  The  largest  increase  in  the  account  is  for  the  Hydrogen  R&D
Initiatives, consisting of FreedomCAR and the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative, which total
$283  million  ($29  million,  11  percent)  within  EERE.  EERE  R&D  programs  exclud-
ing  hydrogen-related  activities  were  cut  by  a  total  of  $77  million  (-10  percent)  to
$692  million.  Total  hydrogen  funding  at  DOE  is  $358  million,  up  $48  million  (16
percent),  including  contributions  from  the  program  budgets  of  Fossil  Energy  ($22
million,  up  $5  million  or  29  percent);  Nuclear  Energy  ($20  million,  up  $11  million
or 124 percent); and Science ($33 million, up $3 million or 11 percent).
ISSUES:
Does  the  proposed  budget  achieve  the  appropriate  balance  among  EERE
programs? EERE funds R&D on a range of alternative technologies, including bio-
mass,  wind,  solar,  and  geothermal  energy.  Energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy
are  important  future  sources  of  energy  with  minimal  impact  on  the  environment.
Continuing  the  trend  of  recent  years’  budget  requests,  an  increasing  amount  of
EERE funds have been requested for the President’s hydrogen initiatives, including
fuel  and  vehicle  programs.  Since  2001,  funding  for  EERE  R&D  programs  not  in-
cluded  in  the  hydrogen  initiatives  has  decreased  by  13  percent.  Hydrogen  must  be
made  from  other  energy  sources.  Renewables  and  energy  efficiency  R&D  can  con-
tribute to the success of the transition to hydrogen: efficiency improvements in vehi-
cles  will  help  reduce  the  technical  challenges  facing  automakers;  and  renewables
can  provide  an  environmentally  friendly  energy  source  for  hydrogen  manufacture.
Both  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  and  the  American  Physical  Society  have
noted  that  more  R&D  will  be  needed  in  alternative  energy  sources  to  help  enable
a hydrogen economy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the event that the
technical  challenges  for  hydrogen  are  too  great,  renewable  biofuels  provide  one  of
the few alternatives to foreign oil for transportation.
What are the appropriate roles for government in long-term and near-term
R&D?  The  Administration  has  emphasized  long-range  high-risk  research  as  the
most  important  role  for  government,  especially  given  the  well-documented  difficul-
ties  in  securing  private  funding  for  long-range  R&D.  On  the  one  hand,  the  Com-
mittee has been concerned that some long range efforts, like the transition to hydro-
gen,  have  skipped  over  important  basic  scientific  research  questions  in  a  rush  to
commercialization.  On  the  other  hand,  there  appear  to  be  numerous  technologies
that could benefit from additional technology transfer and deployment activities, yet
DOE  continues  to  focus  on  incremental  research.  According  to  the  Alliance  to  Save
Energy,  technologies  exist  today  that  have  the  potential  to  save  consumers  over  $4
billion  in  energy  costs  per  year  in  2010.  What  emphasis  should  the  Department

place on assisting efficiency technologies into the marketplace? How is DOE coordi-
nating its existing deployment programs with its technology development efforts?

D) OFFICE OF FOSSIL ENERGY
BACKGROUND:

Budget  Highlights:  The  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  has  two  accounts  that  fund  re-
search,  development  and  demonstration  activities:  the  Fossil  Energy  Research  and
Development  account,  and  the  Clean  Coal  Technology  account.  Clean  coal  dem-
onstration projects in the R&D account are limited to $68 million, essentially equal
to  last  year’s  funding.  The  budget  includes  $18  million  to  continue  design  of  a  coal
power  plant  with  carbon  dioxide  exhaust  capture  and  sequestration  known  as
FutureGen.

The  Clean  Coal  Technology  account  had  large  appropriations  in  the  1990s  which
were  then  allocated  to  specific  projects.  Several  of  these  projects  were  not  under-
taken or canceled, and large balances remain in the account. The appropriators de-
ferred  (forward-funded)  $257  million  of  this  funding  to  FY06.  The  budget  proposes
to  defer  the  funding  again  (to  FY07),  and  to  transfer  the  uncommitted  funding  to
the  Fossil  Energy  account  to  cover  part  of  the  $650  million  proposed  federal  share
of the FutureGen project.
ISSUES:
What  would  the  impact  be  of  the  proposed  elimination  of  the  oil  and  gas
research programs? Over the last several years, the Department has consistently
requested cuts to the oil and gas research programs. Evaluations of these programs
by the Office of Management and Budget have consistently rated them ‘‘ineffective.’’
H.R.  6,  passed  by  the  House  of  Representatives  on  April  21,  2005,  funds  an  ultra-
deepwater  and  unconventional  oil  and  gas  R&D  program,  using  mandatory  spend-
ing.
Does  the  proposal  in  the  budget  propose  to  move  FutureGen  from  the
Clean Coal program into Fossil Energy have policy implications? DOE would
provide funding for the FutureGen demonstration project to build a new coal gasifi-
cation  power  plant  that  would  include  the  sequestration  of  carbon  dioxide  and  po-
tentially the production of hydrogen. Gasification turns the coal into a synthetic gas
that  can  be  burned  in  a  turbine  like  natural  gas,  or  used  as  a  chemical  feedstock.
(The Clean Coal program has funded at least three previous coal gasification power
plants,  and  gasification  is  commonly  used  in  petroleum  refining.)  The  proposed
transfer  of  Clean  Coal  funds  to  the  Fossil  Energy  R&D  account  would  reduce  the
restrictions that help prevent cost-overruns in large demonstration projects.
Does  the  proposed  budget  for  FutureGen  follow  the  requirements  in  law
that  demonstration  projects  be  cost  shared  with  industry  on  a  fifty-fifty
basis?  The  FY06  request  details  the  funding  for  this  project,  and  shows  that  $620
million  of  the  $950  million  cost  of  the  project  (over  65  percent)  would  come  from

the Federal Government. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires that demonstration
programs receive no more than 50 percent of their funding from federal sources.
What  are  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  to  the  management  structure
proposed  for  FutureGen?  The  current  plan  for  FutureGen  would  have  a  consor-
tium  act  as  the  intermediary  between  the  Department  and  the  organization  that
will  own  and  operate  the  FutureGen  project.  This  approach  appears  to  be  a  depar-
ture from the Department’s usual approach of signing a cooperative agreement with
the project performer.
Why  does  DOE  propose  to  cut  funding  for  stationary  fuel  cells?  Many  ana-
lysts  view  the  stationary  fuel  cell  programs  funded  by  Fossil  Energy  as  an  impor-
tant stepping-stone to low-cost transportation fuel cells that are at the heart of the
transition to a hydrogen economy. While fuel cell funding is up in the transportation
programs of EERE, stationary fuel cell funding in Fossil is cut by 12 percent.

E) OFFICE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
BACKGROUND:

Budget  Highlights:  The  Department’s  budget  proposes  to  eliminate  the  Nuclear
Energy Research Initiative (NERI), which funds university researchers, and the Nu-
clear  Energy  Plant  Optimization  (NEPO)  program,  which  is  targeted  toward  boost-
ing  output  from  existing  nuclear  plants.  The  Department  has  proposed  that  funds
for NEPO be allocated to other Nuclear R&D programs and the NERI be integrated
into  the  Department’s  nuclear  energy  R&D  programs.  It  is  unclear  whether  this
merger will allow NERI’S focus on fundamental research questions to continue.
ISSUES:
How  will  the  reorganization  of  the  Idaho  laboratory  complex  affect  DOE’s
overall  nuclear  energy  R&D  program?  In  2003,  DOE  proposed  to  revamp  the
contracts of Idaho National Environmental and Engineering Laboratory and the co-
located  Argonne  West  National  Laboratory,  and  merge  them  into  one  research  unit
as the lead nuclear energy laboratory for the country. What role will other national
laboratories  with  significant  nuclear  expertise,  such  as  Argonne  National  Labora-
tory,  play  in  nuclear  energy  R&D  after  Idaho  National  Laboratory  begins  oper-
ations?
What  are  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  to  the  management  structure
proposed  for  Next  Generation  Nuclear  Plant?  The  current  plan  for  NGNP
would  have  a  consortium  act  as  the  intermediary  between  the  Department  and  the
organization  that  will  own  and  operate  the  project.  This  approach  appears  to  be  a
departure from the Department’s usual approach of signing a cooperative agreement
with the project performer. One immediate question posed by this proposed arrange-
ment  is:  what  is  the  liability  of  the  Federal  Government  in  the  event  that  the  pri-
vate-sector  partners  walk  away  from  the  project  before  the  demonstration  is  com-
pleted?

Does  the  Nuclear  Energy  R&D  program  intend  to  stimulate  the  revitaliza-
tion of a domestic nuclear energy industry? The domestic nuclear industry has
shrunk  considerably  since  the  last  nuclear  power  plant  was  ordered  in  the  1970s.
Will the U.S. industry be willing and able to participate under proposed plans?

F) OFFICE OF ELECTRICITY DELIVERY AND ENERGY RELIABILITY
BACKGROUND:

Budget  Highlights:  Two  new  initiatives  from  FY04,  GridWise  and  GridWorks,
were cut by a total of $1.3 million (-12 percent). These programs are focused on de-
veloping  communications  and  control  technologies  along  with  advanced  cables,
switches,  and  monitors  to  improve  the  transmission  and  distribution  of  electricity.
ISSUES:
What  will  cuts  to  energy  storage  R&D  imply  for  other  DOE  programs?  En-
ergy Storage programs resided in EERE prior to the creation of the Office of Electric
Transmission  and  Distribution  and  its  subsequent  reorganization  into  the  Office  of
Electricity  Delivery  and  Energy  Reliability.  The  storage  of  energy  is  an  important
tool  for  improving  the  stability  and  reliability  of  the  grid,  and  is  vital  to  emerging
energy resources such as wind and solar-generated electricity. Such sources can only
generate  power  intermittently  (when  the  wind  is  blowing,  for  example),  and  they
would be much more attractive if the energy they generate could be stored for later
use.  Funding  for  Energy  Storage  R&D  in  FY04  was  $8.8  million,  but  has  been  cut
considerably. In FY06, the request for Energy Storage again received a large cut $1
million  (-25  percent)  to  $3  million,  following  on  last  year’s  cut  of  $4.8  million,  (-55
percent) to $4 million.
How  is  the  work  of  the  Office  of  Electricity  and  Energy  Assurance  coordi-
nated  with  the  other  applied  energy  offices?  The  work  of  the  R&D  programs
in  electricity  transmission  and  distribution  is  important  for  the  successful  integra-
tion of the energy resources being developed in the applied energy R&D offices. Does
the  Office  undertake  any  joint  research  efforts?  How  are  the  results  of  the  R&D
transmitted to the other offices?

5. Witnesses Questions

Witnesses  have  been  asked  to  summarize  the  budget  request  for  their  offices  fo-
cusing on activities identified as part of the Federal Science and Technology (FS&T)
budget and specifically address the following issues:

12

Questions for Dr. Orbach
Given  the  reduced  funding  outlook  for  Office  of  Science,  do  you  plan  to  revise  your
20-Year  Facilities  Plan?  How  will  you  make  the  choices  between  building  new  and
running  existing  facilities,  and  between  facilities  and  funding  for  research  grants?
Will  the  Department  be  able  to  simultaneously  support  three  facilities  for  nuclear
physics—the  Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider,  the  Continuous  Electron  Beam  Accel-
erator Facility and the Rare Isotope Accelerator? If not, when and how will the De-
partment make a decision about the future of its nuclear physics facilities?
Given  limited  funds,  many  in  the  fusion  research  community  have  indicated  that
the U.S. should drop its participation in ITER if it would require deep cuts in fund-
ing  for  the  domestic  program.  Do  you  agree?  If  we  do  go  ahead  with  ITER,  how
would you continue to support a domestic program and what would it look like?
Does  the  Department  intend  to  support  a  high  energy  physics  (HEP)  facility  in  the
U.S.  after  2010?  Would  that  be  necessary  given  U.S.  participation  in  HEP  experi-
ments at the European Large Hadron Collider (LHC)?

Questions for Mr. Faulkner
How  does  your  Office  determine  the  proper  balance  between  shorter-term  and
longer-term projects in its portfolio?
What  steps  is  the  Department  taking  to  ensure  that  technologies  for  shorter-term
gains in energy efficiency and alternative sources make the transition into the mar-
ketplace?
Both  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  and  the  American  Physical  Society  have
noted  that  more  R&D  will  be  needed  in  alternative  energy  sources  to  help  enable
a  hydrogen  economy.  How  does  the  budget  for  renewable  energy  R&D  address  this
need?

Questions for Mr. Maddox
Using  the  definitions  in  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  Circular  A–11,  what  is
the  proposed  mix  of  funding  in  the  fiscal  year  2006  budget  request  between  basic
research,  applied  research,  development,  demonstration,  and  deployment  activities
for your Office? Please provide the comparable fiscal year 2005 numbers.
What is the rationale for eliminating the oil and gas technology research and devel-
opment programs at the Department?

Questions for Mr. Johnson
Why are the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative and the Nuclear Energy Plant Op-
timization programs being eliminated?
What  role  will  other  National  Laboratories  with  significant  nuclear  expertise,  such
as  Argonne  National  Laboratory,  play  in  nuclear  energy  R&D  after  Idaho  National
Laboratory begins operations?
Please  explain  the  ownership  and  management  structure  the  Department  is  pro-
posing for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant. What advantages and disadvantages
does this approach have? What happens if the industrial partners fail to fulfill their
obligations?

Questions for Mr. Kolevar
How  does  your  Office  determine  the  proper  balance  between  shorter-term  and
longer-term projects in its portfolio?
What  is  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  reduction  in  the  fiscal  year  2006  budget  for
energy storage, given its likely contribution to improving grid stability and enabling
the connecting of intermittent sources (such as wind) to the grid?
What is the rationale for cuts to Gridwise and Gridworks, given that these programs
were  just  created  last  year?  What  impacts  will  these  cuts  have  on  the  ability  of
these  programs  to  help  modernize  the  electric  grid  and  turn  prototype  technologies
into  useful  and  widely  used  technologies  for  the  grid?  What  is  the  proper  role  for
the industry in these research efforts?

Chairwoman BIGGERT. The Subcommittee will come to order.
First,  I  would  like  to  welcome  everyone  to  the  first  Energy  Sub-
committee  hearing  of  the  109th  Congress.  I  would  like  to  welcome
our  new  Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Honda.  And  I  would  also  like  to
welcome our witnesses, Dr. Raymond Orbach, Director of the Office
of  Science,  Mr.  Douglas  Faulkner,  Principal  Deputy  Assistant  Sec-
retary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and Mr. Mark
Maddox,  Principal  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Fossil  Energy,
and Mr. Robert Shane Johnson, Director for Technology, the Office
of  Nuclear  Energy,  Science,  and  Technology,  and  Mr.  Kevin
Kolevar,  Director  for  the  Office  of  Electricity  Delivery  and  Energy
Reliability.

As  our  witnesses  should  know,  spoken  testimony  is  limited  to
five  minutes  each,  after  which  the  Members  of  the  Energy  Sub-
committee will have five minutes each to answer questions. So hold
that, because we have a few things to do first.

And  I  apologize  for  starting  late.  We  have  to  have  a  quorum  be-
fore  we  can  start,  and  we  are  going  to,  unfortunately,  have  to  re-
cess  shortly  because  of  a  vote  that  will  be  coming  up  and  a  photo-
graph on the House Floor.

So  I  will  recognize  myself  for  five  minutes  for  an  opening  state-

ment.

And  I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  this  Energy  Subcommittee
hearing on the Administration’s priorities for research and develop-
ment in the Department of Energy Budget for fiscal year 2006.

It  is  no  secret  that  we  are  operating  in  the  most  constrained
budget  environment  in  many  years.  Such  an  environment  is  espe-
cially  important  for  Congress  to  scrutinize  the  plans  and  question
the  priorities  of  any  and  all  departments  when  it  comes  to  spend-
ing  limited  resources.  The  Department  of  Energy  is  no  exception.
I  am  as  fiscally  conservative  as  they  come,  and  while  I  agree  that
we should be able to find savings in just about every corner of the
federal  budget,  I  do  not  believe  that  we  should  be  cutting  corners
when  it  comes  to  our  search  for  energy  solutions  and  the  science
behind them.

As  the  Nation  struggles—as  the  Nation  pays  unprecedented
prices  for  oil  and  natural  gas,  it  struggles  to  contain  the  resulting
inflationary  pressure.  It  seems  counterintuitive  to  reduce  funding
for  applied  energy  research  and  development  programs  that  could
help  ease  our  demand  for  energy  or  lead  to  alternative  sources  of
it, namely our energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.

The  same  can  be  said  for  the  basic  science  programs  funded  by
the  Department  of  Energy.  As  the  Nation  emerges  from  an  eco-
nomic  slowdown  and  confronts  global  competition  on  a  variety  of
fronts, it also seems counterintuitive to cut, by almost four percent,
the basic, fundamental research that is the foundation of American
innovation and creativity and competitiveness.

But  in  some  specific  ways,  this  is  what  the  Administration’s
budget proposes to do. Based on an analysis by Subcommittee staff,
funding  for  every  applied  energy  R&D  program  has  increased  over
the course of the last five years, some substantially. However, this
is  misleading  when  it  comes  to  one  program  in  particular.  When
you  exclude  the  significant  increases  provided  for  the  President’s
hydrogen  and  FreedomCAR  initiatives,  the  Energy  Efficiency  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:35 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 020735 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\042705\20735 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

14

Renewable  Energy,  EERE,  program,  actually  has  suffered  a  per-
centage decline in the double digits over the course of the last five
years.

Don’t  get  me  wrong.  I  strongly  support  the  hydrogen  and
FreedomCAR initiatives, but are we sacrificing short and mid-term
successes  in  many  sectors  for  the  sake  of  one  long  shot  in  one  sec-
tor,  transportation  over  the  long-term.  If  so,  this  is  a  wise  choice,
especially  considering  that  a  National  Academy  of  Sciences  study
estimates  that  for  every  dollar  spent  on  efficiency  initiatives  alone
between 1978 and 2000, more than $4 of economic benefits were re-
alized? We will explore this more today.

At  this  point,  I  have  become  accustomed  to  lamenting  proposed
reductions  to  the  nuclear  energy  R&D  program.  That  is  not  the
case this year. I am particularly pleased with the proposed funding
levels for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative.

As  costs  mount  over  the  Federal  Government’s  failure  to  com-
plete  Yucca  Mountain,  I  think  it  is  time  that  we  revisit  the  issue
of using advanced reactors to recycle some of the spent nuclear fuel
scattered  across  this  country.  This  is  even  more  critical  if  a  plan
to  encourage  the  construction  of  new  plants  succeeds.  That  plan,
which President Bush is expected to outline later today, would pro-
vide  federal  risk  insurance  to  companies  that  construct  new  nu-
clear power plants.

As  for  the  other  basic  research  supported  by  the  DOE,  this  sub-
committee  has  noticed  a  trend.  Three  years  ago,  Office  of  Science
funding for facilities equaled that for research grants. Today, fund-
ing  for  research  grants  is  less  than  for  facilities.  Considering  that
DOE’s user facilities are over-subscribed by a factor of three in the
case of basic energy sciences programs within the Office of Science,
this may have been a prudent decision in light of fiscal constraints.
However, I do not believe this is sustainable, especially considering
that  DOE’s  research  grants  help  fund  the  education  and  training
of  approximately  23,500  graduate  students,  technicians,  postdocs,
and faculty.

Finally,  when  it  comes  to  new  facilities,  I  am  very  concerned
about  the  significant  amount  of  our  limited  resources  that  this
budget has allocated to the international fusion experiment, known
as ITER, which doesn’t even have a home yet. And considering that
the  patience  of  this  committee  is  growing  thin  as  we  continue  to
wait  for  the  DOE  to  respond  to  our  written  questions  from  a  Full
Committee hearing on the President’s budget held over two months
ago, I must again express skepticism and concern about the moving
target that is the U.S. contribution to the ITER project. I certainly
hope  this  is  something  we  can  nail  down  and  soon.  I  would  hate
for this lingering question to erode support for this project.

On that note, I will conclude by saying that I am looking forward
to hearing the testimony of the witnesses here today. We are going
to discuss programs that matter a great deal to our nation’s energy
security  and  our  economic  future.  During  these  tight  fiscal  times,
we  must  set  priorities  and  use  limited  resources  wisely.  We  are
here  today  to  make  sure  the  proposed  fiscal  year  2006  budget
meets these standards.

Thank you.

And at this time, I would recognize our Ranking Member of this

subcommittee, Mr. Honda, for his opening statement.

Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Chairwoman Biggert, and thank you for
holding this important hearing today, my first as a Ranking Mem-
ber  of  this  subcommittee.  And  I  regret  that  I  will  not  be  able  to
be here in its entirety, and I apologize to all of you in advance.

I  also  extend  my  thanks  to  the  distinguished  panel  of  witnesses
for  taking  the  time  to  be  here  today  to  tell  us  in  greater  detail
about the budgets of your respective programs.

It  probably  comes  as  no  surprise  to  anyone  that  I  am  dis-
appointed by the five-percent decline in the Department of Energy’s
non-defense R&D budget. I expect to hear talk about times of tight
budgets  and  the  need  to  make  tough  choices,  but  I  continue  to  be-
lieve that we do not really need to be in this budget situation, rath-
er  that  it  was  created  by  tax  cuts  for  the  wealthiest  of  Americans
here.

What  troubles  me  the  most  is  that  these  R&D  funding  cuts  are
coming  at  a  time  when  other  nations  are  increasing  their  invest-
ments  in  basic  scientific  research  and  development  and  as  well  as
commercializing  technology.  When  other  nations  are  posing  a
greater  challenge  than  ever  to  U.S.  competitiveness  in  the  global
marketplace,  we  are  making  it  easier  for  them  to  catch  up  and
even  surpass  us  rather  than  investing  in  what  made  the  United
States great.

The  President’s  own  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Tech-
nology,  PCAST,  has  decried  prior  under-funding  of  physical
sciences  and  the  DOE  Office  of  Science,  in  particular.  Without  ad-
ditional funds, our national labs will be forced to continue to defer
maintenance  and  deteriorate.  Our  best  and  brightest  students  will
choose not to pursue careers in math, science, and engineering and
innovation at our companies will suffer.

I  am  fortunate  to  come  from  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area  and  to
have  had  many  opportunities  to  visit  Department  of  Energy  facili-
ties,  the  Stanford  Linear  Accelerator  Center,  Lawrence  Berkeley
National Lab, and the Lawrence Livermore National Lab. And dur-
ing those visits, as well as at hearings in this room, I have learned
about the critical role DOE plays in advancing U.S. science.

I  have  learned,  as  you  all  know,  that  DOE  is  the  leading  source
of federal funds and facilities for research in the physical sciences,
providing 42 percent of the federal investment in these disciplines.
In subfields such as high-energy and nuclear physics, nuclear medi-
cine,  heavy-element  chemistry,  plasma  physics,  and  the  magnetic
fusion and catalysis, DOE is the primary government sponsor.

I  have  learned  that  DOE’s  significant  investment  in  major  user
facilities located at the universities and National Laboratories sets
it  apart  from  other  agencies.  More  than  19,000  researchers  use
DOE’s scientific facilities every year, nearly half of who are univer-
sity  faculty  members  and  students.  Were  it  not  for  DOE,  these
vital scientific facilities would not exist in the United States.

I  appreciate  the  efforts  you  put  forth,  Dr.  Orbach,  to  maintain
funding levels for these facilities within the fiscal year 2006 budget
request. Unfortunately, as you have explained, these funding levels
come  at  the  cost  of  cuts  to  support  for  investigators  and  their  re-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:35 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 020735 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\042705\20735 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

16

search projects, which means the facilities will not be used to their
full potential.

I applaud the work you have done with the scientific community
to  develop  plans  on  how  you  would  spend  additional  funds  respon-
sibly.  Your  Office  of  Science  Strategic  Plan  and  Twenty  Year  Out-
look on Facilities for the Future of Science provide a clear rationale
for  why  additional  funding  for  DOE  science  is  warranted  and  a
road map on how these funds should be spent.

Unfortunately,  we  are  only  in  the  first  budget  cycle  covered  by
these  plans,  and  already  funding  levels  are  insufficient  to  address
the needs identified in them. This is an inauspicious beginning.

I  am  also  perplexed  by  cuts  to  the  Energy  Efficiency  R&D  and
Renewable  Energy  R&D  programs.  Just  the  other  day,  as  the
House passed an energy bill that provided incentives to explore for
more  oil  and  gas,  President  Bush  said  ‘‘with  $55  oil  we  don’t  need
incentives to oil and gas companies to explore—what we need is to
put a strategy in place that will help this country over time become
less dependent.’’

It  seems  to  me  that  the  best  way  to  achieve  this  laudable  goal
is  to  become  less  dependent  on  oil  and  gas,  is  to  use  less  energy,
and to develop other sources of energy. And yet the fiscal year 2006
DOE  budget  cuts  research  in  these  critical  areas,  in  such  fields  as
Building  Technologies,  which  is  at  minus  12  percent,  Industrial
Technologies,  which  is  at  minus  25  percent,  and  the  Biomass  pro-
gram, which is at minus 18 percent.

But  we  can  not  afford  to  wait  until  the  need  grows  even  greater
and  then  suddenly  ramp  up  our  investment,  because  that  will  not
work.  Research  takes  both  money  and  time,  so  we  must  keep  in-
vesting steadily to make the progress that is needed. And if we fail
to  invest  in  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  now,  talented
scientists  and  engineers  will  apply  their  skills  elsewhere  and  will
not be available when the need becomes even more pressing.

There  are  many  questions  that  must  be  answered  about  this
budget  request  and  the  direction  in  which  DOE  is  headed  in  the
future. I hope the witnesses will provide us with those answers.

Thank  you,  Madame  Chair,  and  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my

time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL M. HONDA

Chairwoman Biggert, thank you for holding this important hearing today, my first
as  the  Ranking  Member  of  this  subcommittee.  I  regret  that  I  will  not  be  able  to  be
here  for  the  entire  hearing,  and  I  apologize  to  the  witnesses  in  advance  for  having
to leave.

I  also  extend  my  thanks  to  the  distinguished  panel  of  witnesses  for  taking  the
time to be here today to tell us in greater detail about the budgets of your respective
programs.

It probably comes as no surprise to anyone that I am disappointed by the five per-
cent  decline  in  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Non-Defense  R&D  budget.  I  expect  to
hear  talk  about  ‘‘times  of  tight  budgets’’  and  the  need  to  make  tough  choices,  but
I continue to believe that we do not really need to be in this budget situation, rather
that it was created by tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.

What troubles me the most is that these R&D funding cuts are coming at a time
when other nations are increasing their investments in basic scientific research and
development, as well as in commercializing technology. When other nations are pos-
ing  a  greater  challenge  than  ever  to  US  competitiveness  in  the  global  marketplace,
we  are  making  it  easier  for  them  to  catch  up  and  even  surpass  us,  rather  than  in-
vesting in what made the United States great.

The  President’s  own  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Technology  has  decried
prior  under-funding  of  physical  sciences,  and  the  DOE  Office  of  Science  in  par-
ticular.  Without  additional  funds,  our  national  labs  will  be  forced  to  continue  to
defer  maintenance  and  deteriorate;  our  best  and  brightest  students  will  choose  not
to  pursue  careers  in  math,  science,  and  engineering;  and  innovation  at  our  compa-
nies will suffer.

I  am  fortunate  to  come  from  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area  and  to  have  had  many
opportunities  to  visit  Department  of  Energy  facilities—the  Stanford  Linear  Accel-
erator  Center,  Lawrence  Berkeley  National  Lab,  and  Lawrence  Livermore  National
Lab.  During  those  visits,  as  well  as  at  hearings  in  this  room,  I  have  learned  about
the critical role DOE plays in advancing U.S. science.

I  have  learned,  as  you  all  know,  that  DOE  is  the  leading  source  of  federal  funds
and  facilities  for  research  in  the  physical  sciences,  providing  42  percent  of  the  fed-
eral  investment  in  these  disciplines.  In  subfields  such  as  high-energy  and  nuclear
physics,  nuclear  medicine,  heavy-element  chemistry,  plasma  physics  and  magnetic
fusion and catalysis, DOE is the primary government sponsor.

I  have  learned  that  DOE’s  significant  investment  in  major  user  facilities  located
at  universities  and  national  laboratories  sets  it  apart  from  other  agencies.  More
than 19,000 researchers use DOE’s scientific facilities every year, nearly half of who
are  university  faculty  members  and  students.  Were  it  not  for  DOE,  these  vital  sci-
entific facilities would not exist in the U.S.

I  appreciate  the  efforts  you  put  forth,  Dr.  Orbach,  to  maintain  funding  levels  for
these  facilities  within  the  Fiscal  Year  2006  budget  request.  Unfortunately,  as  you
have  explained,  these  funding  levels  come  at  the  cost  of  cuts  to  support  for  inves-
tigators  and  their  research  projects,  which  means  the  facilities  will  not  be  used  to
their full potential.

I applaud the work you have done with the scientific community to develop plans
on  how  you  would  spend  additional  funds  responsibly.  Your  Office  of  Science  Stra-
tegic  Plan  and  Twenty  Year  Outlook  on  Facilities  for  the  Future  of  Science  provide
a  clear  rationale  for  why  additional  funding  for  DOE  science  is  warranted  and  a
roadmap on how these funds should be spent.

Unfortunately,  we  are  only  in  the  first  budget  cycle  covered  by  these  plans  and
already funding levels are insufficient to address the needs identified in them. This
is an inauspicious beginning.

I am also perplexed by cuts to the Energy Efficiency R&D and Renewable Energy
R&D  programs.  Just  the  other  day,  as  the  House  passed  an  Energy  Bill  that  pro-
vided incentives to explore for more oil and gas, President Bush said that ‘‘with $55
oil  we  don’t  need  incentives  to  oil  and  gas  companies  to  explore.. . .What  we  need
is  to  put  a  strategy  in  place  that  will  help  this  country  over  time  become  less  de-
pendent.’’

It  seems  to  me  that  the  best  way  to  achieve  this  laudable  goal,  to  become  less
dependent  on  oil  and  gas,  is  to  use  less  energy  and  to  develop  other  sources  of  en-
ergy. And yet the Fiscal Year 2006 DOE budget cuts research in these critical areas,
in  such  fields  as  Building  Technologies  (-12  percent),  Industrial  Technologies  (-25
percent), and the Biomass program (-18 percent).

We  cannot  afford  to  wait  until  the  need  grows  even  greater  and  then  suddenly
ramp  up  our  investment,  because  that  will  not  work.  Research  takes  both  money
and  time,  so  we  must  keep  investing  steadily  to  make  the  progress  that  is  needed.
And if we fail to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency now, talented sci-
entists  and  engineers  will  apply  their  skills  elsewhere  and  will  not  be  available
when the need becomes even more pressing.

There  are  many  questions  that  must  be  answered  about  this  budget  request  and
the  direction  in  which  DOE  is  headed  in  the  future,  and  I  hope  the  witnesses  will
provide us with those answers.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Honda.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE LYNN WOOLSEY

Thank you, Madame Chairman.
I am pleased to be here today, because this hearing is an important one. We need
real  energy  independence  in  the  United  States.  But  energy  independence  will  only
come  about  when  we  start  focusing  our  efforts  on  clean,  renewable  sources  of  en-
ergy.

In considering the Fiscal Year 2006 Budget, I hope that the Department of Energy
is  focused  on  the  important  goal  of  energy  independence.  More  than  ever  before,

America’s  energy  requirements  have  become  an  issue  of  national  security.  Nothing
hurts our security as much as our dependence on Middle East oil.

We  need  to  pursue  clean,  environmentally  friendly,  renewable  sources  of  energy.
This  is  the  best  and  only  way  to  ensure  both  America’s  energy  independence  while
also preserving the environment for future generations.

In the process, we must not focus our efforts on stop-gap measures like oil drilling
in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Drilling in Alaska will do little to reduce our
current dependence on foreign oil, because it will take more than ten years to proc-
ess what little oil may be there.

If we spend half the time promoting policies that encourage the use of renewable
energy  that  we  do  discussing  drilling  in  ANWR,  we  can  develop  a  sensible  energy
policy  that  ensures  real  energy  independence.  I  hope  the  DOE  Budget  for  Fiscal
Year 2006 takes this into consideration.

I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Davis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE LINCOLN DAVIS

Good  morning.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  have  this  hearing  and  the  wit-

nesses who are here today.

The  activities  of  the  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory,  near  my  District,  are  being
hurt by budget cuts. It is my hope that today’s hearing will underscore the fact that
if we do not finish what we started in planning for and supporting these programs,
our nation’s computing, energy, and life science research programs will suffer.

Last  May,  DOE  Secretary  Abraham  announced  that  Oak  Ridge  was  the  winner
of  a  DOE  competition  to  establish  a  leadership-class  computing  facility.  Secretary
Abraham stated that the U.S. must ‘‘make the commitment necessary to regain the
clear-cut lead’’ in supercomputing.

Last year, the President signed the DOE High-End Computing Revitalization Act
of 2004, drafted in the House Science Committee, in November 2004. And yesterday
afternoon,  the  House  approved  H.R.  28,  a  bill  to  strengthen  agency  efforts  to  sup-
port the supercomputing enterprise.

With  all  this  momentum,  I  was  surprised  by  the  President’s  FY06  request  for
high-end computing. The Center for Computational Sciences at Oak Ridge, home to
the leadership computing facility Secretary Abraham commended, received only $25
million in the budget—a figure well below FY05 and even FY04 levels.

That  money  is  not  enough  to  even  operate  the  two  supercomputing  machines
being  purchased  in  FY05,  and  it  does  not  allow  any  hardware  upgrades  to  those
computers.  DOE  does  not  appear  to  be  fulfilling  the  vision  articulated  by  Secretary
Abraham just a year ago, which was to regain the lead in high-end computing.

A second issue that I have deals with the DOE’s Genomics ‘‘Genomes to Life’’ pro-
gram. I understand that DOE is currently planning a set of four core research facili-
ties.  The  scope  and  scale  of  the  four  facilities  is  impressive,  and  the  cost  estimates
for  each  run  to  approximately  $250  million.  I  do  not  understand  why  DOE  is  plan-
ning big budgets for start-up initiatives when it is not providing needed funding for
its current programs.

Due  to  time  constraints,  I  ask  that  the  questions  I  have  today  be  submitted  for
the  Record.  I  hope  that  the  Department  of  Energy  will  respond  to  these  questions
to me in writing.

In summary, I feel that it is unfair and unjustified for Oak Ridge and other DOE
national labs to go through the planning process, set goals, be promised the funding,
and  have  the  rug  pulled  out  from  underneath  them.  I  hope  that  the  Department
of  Energy  will  rethink  its  budget  policies.  The  Oak  Ridge  supercomputing  facility
is an economic jewel to Tennessee and to our nation. I hope that the proposed budg-
et cuts do not tarnish that jewel.
Supercomputing Questions:

1) Does DOE intend in FY 2007 to resume hardware acquisition to actually es-

tablish a true leadership class computing facility?

2) What are the Department’s long-term plans for the leadership facility award-

ed last year to the team led by Oak Ridge National Lab?

3) How does contribute to establishment of a leadership class computer?
4) How does the Department justify the newly proposed ‘‘Research and Evalua-
tion  Prototypes,’’  funded  at  $13.2  million,  a  ‘‘new  start’’  in  FY06  when  the
budget  also  includes  a  significant  cut  to  the  Center  for  Computational
Sciences, an established program?

Genomes to Life/Priorities Question:

Given the constrained budgets faced by DOE in the coming fiscal years, which al-
ready  are  constraining  operation  of  existing  user  facilities,  will  DOE  reconsider  the
scale  and  scope  of  these  four  GTL  start-up  facilities,  so  that  the  cost  of  each  is  re-
duced?

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good morning. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before our committee
to  discuss  the  Department  of  Energy’s  FY  2006  budget  request.  Today’s  hearing
serves  as  an  opportunity  to  review  the  proposed  research  and  development  budgets
and to clarify the President’s energy-related science and technology priorities.

The  Department  of  Energy’s  Fossil  Energy  Research  and  Development  program
impacts  my  congressional  district  because  the  coal  industry  is  of  great  importance
to  the  economy  and  livelihood  of  my  constituents  in  Southern  Illinois.  My  home
state  has  almost  one-eighth  the  coal  reserves  in  the  United  States  and  the  largest
reserves of bituminous coal in the Nation. We have long supported the coal industry
through programs that finance research, development, and commercialization of new
technologies  and  uses  of  coal.  As  a  result,  I  am  proud  to  say  that  Illinois  is  a  na-
tional leader in developing clean and efficient coal technologies.

The Administration’s budget for FutureGen and the base coal R&D programs ap-
pears  to  be  one  of  the  best  budget  requests  in  recent  years.  I  would  like  to  express
my support for protecting the base coal R&D and welcomed the inclusion of $18 mil-
lion  for  the  FutureGen  clean  coal  power  plant  project  for  FY06.  Further  developing
the technology to burn coal as cleanly as possible is a great national investment and
it  will  benefit  the  economy  of  Southern  Illinois.  I  have  led  the  effort  to  locate
FutureGen  in  Illinois,  including  leading  a  bipartisan  effort  in  the  House  to  secure
funding  for  the  project.  I  also  hosted  a  roundtable  discussion  regarding  FutureGen
and what it means for Illinois and was pleased to have Mr. Mark Maddox in attend-
ance.  This  year,  I  initiated  a  bipartisan  letter  to  the  House  Energy  and  Water  De-
velopment  Subcommittee  to  express  congressional  support  for  the  Administration’s
FY06 fossil energy coal programs. We are asking that coal research and demonstra-
tion programs be funded at or above a higher level in order to achieve the intended
goals  that  support  the  FutureGen  vision  of  coal  fueled  generation  of  electricity  and
hydrogen with essentially zero emissions. I will continue to be a strong advocate for
implementing  the  coal  research  programs,  which  includes  the  clean  coal  technology
program  and  the  FutureGen  project  because  they  are  significant  to  my  District.  I
am  committed  to  working  with  my  colleagues,  the  Administration,  and  industry  to
ensure the project continues to move forward as planned and will continue to advo-
cate its site location in Southern Illinois.

I welcome our panel of witnesses and look forward to their testimony.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank  you,  Madam  Chairman.  I  greatly  appreciate  you  calling  this  hearing  and
I  am  especially  grateful  that  our  distinguished  witnesses  have  agreed  to  take  time
out of their busy schedules to answer our questions today.

The purpose of this hearing is to provide an opportunity to explore issues affecting

the entire Research and Development (R&D) budget.

As  I  said  at  the  Research  and  Development  budget  hearing  we  had  in  February,
I  have  a  lot  to  say  today  about  the  budget  we  have  before  us.  The  budget  includes
severe cuts to almost every major government program and creates a deficit in 2006
that is likely to top $400 billion. This budget can be categorized as reckless and irre-
sponsible.

Programs  to  promote  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  would  be  reduced  to  about
$1.2  billion  or  four  percent.  Double-digit  cuts  to  many  programs  in  this  category
were  hidden  by  a  16  percent  increase  to  $260  million  for  a  program  to  develop  hy-
drogen as an efficient fuel source.

The  reductions  prompted  critics  to  question  the  White  House’s  energy  priorities.
In  addition,  this  plan  would  reduce  the  Department’s  extensive  science  and  tech-
nology  programs  by  about  four  percent,  or  3.5  billion,  while  environmental  cleanup
activities would be reduced by eight percent, to $6.5 billion.

What  really  disturbs  me  about  the  Department  of  Energy’s  budget  is  that  it  as-
sumes $2.4 billion revenue in oil and gas leasing at the Arctic National Wildlife Ref-

uge,  even  though  Congress  has  never  approved  a  plan  opening  this  land  for  oil  ex-
ploration.

Members  of  Congress  must  be  fiscally  responsible  when  it  comes  to  making  deci-
sions  about  our  budget  during  these  trying  times.  Our  greatest  responsibility  is  to
leave our children a world that is safer, more prosperous, and more secure.

This  budget  fails  that  test.  It  is  fiscally  irresponsible.  It  is  morally  irresponsible.

And it demonstrates a failure to lead.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Green follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE AL GREEN

First and foremost, I’d like to thank Chairwoman Biggert and Mr. Honda for initi-
ating  a  hearing  regarding  the  FY06  budget  request  for  the  Department  of  Energy’s
civilian research and development programs. As a freshman Member, I am particu-
larly intrigued by the activities and roles that research and development play as we
move  forward  in  attempting  to  provide  a  comprehensive  energy  strategy.  It  is  my
understanding  that  a  lot  of  our  energy  strategy  framework  is  based  upon  research
and development initiatives of this department, so I take particular pride in having
the  opportunity  to  discuss  these  valuable  programs  and  priorities  with  the  people
that are directly shaping the focus of our energy policy. I find that both my constitu-
ents and I are concerned with an array of energy issues, and I also relish the oppor-
tunity to find out answers for them. In addition to the focus on energy with the dis-
cussion of the energy bill, there has been a heightened awareness of our energy in-
frastructure  because  of  the  Northeastern  energy  grid  black  in  2003,  skyrocketing
gas prices, and revolving blackouts in California about four years ago. A major con-
cern  that  I  have  is  that  the  proposed  budget  seems  to  de-emphasize  the  necessity
for  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  by  continuing  to  reduce  funding  for  en-
ergy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  R&D,  with  the  exception  of  activities  sup-
porting  the  Administration’s  hydrogen  initiatives  so  I  hope  that  we  touch  on  such
a  discussion.  Again,  I’d  like  to  reiterate  my  thanks  to  all  of  the  panelists  for  their
willingness  to  share  their  particular  insights  on  the  various  research  and  develop-
ment  initiatives  proposed  in  the  FY06  budget,  and  I  hope  that  the  Science  Com-
mittee  will  continue  to  have  a  strong  relationship  with  the  Department  of  Energy
research and development sectors in the future.

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  I  think  that  we  will  begin  until  the  bells

go off when we have to have to recess.

But  let  us  start  with  Dr.  Orbach.  I  wish  more  Members  were
here right now, but I am sure they read all of the 20 pages of your
testimony and know it word for word.

Please proceed for five minutes.

STATEMENT OF DR. RAYMOND L. ORBACH, DIRECTOR OF THE
OFFICE  OF  SCIENCE,  DEPARTMENT  OF  ENERGY,  WASH-
INGTON, DC
Dr.  ORBACH.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Biggert  and  Ranking  Mem-
ber  Honda.  Thank  you  both  for  your  opening  remarks.  They  were
very  helpful  and  I  am  very  grateful  for  your  interest  and  commit-
ment for science and for the country.

This is an opportunity for me to discuss with you the fiscal year
2006  budget  for  the  Office  of  Science.  And  as  you  both  noted,  sci-
entific  leadership  for  the  United  States  is  critical  for  our  economy,
for  our  scientific  literacy,  for  the  excitement  of  discovery,  and  for
education in order to attract the very best to science careers.

I  made  the  decisions  for  this  budget  on  that  basis,  namely  how
would  we  use  the  funds  available  to  us  in  this  budget  climate  to
maintain  scientific  leadership  for  the  future.  The  results  were  dif-
ficult in many cases, but I believe that what we have presented to
you  is  a  budget  that  will  maintain  U.S.  leadership  for  the  future.
We  will  be  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2006  major  operations  of  our
facilities. Chairman Biggert has already discussed ITER, which has

21

its first contribution for construction contained in our 2006 budget.
We also will be putting two 20-teraflop computers, the largest ma-
chines  available  to  the  civilian  world,  on  the  floor  in  2006  at  Oak
Ridge  National  Laboratory,  and  shortly,  we  will  be  announcing  a
national  competition  for  opportunities  on  these  machines  for  sci-
entific discovery. We will be starting the Spallation Neutron Source
at  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory,  which  is,  by  an  order  of  mag-
nitude, the most intense neutron source in the world for spallation
neutrons. It will give our scientists an edge over everyone else, not
just for structure, but also for dynamics.

We  are  beginning  the  operation  of  four  of  our  five  nanocenters.
Everyone  is  investing  in  nanotechnology,  but  what  will  set  the
United  States  apart  will  be  these  nanocenters,  which  will  have
within them all of the facilities that our scientists will need for con-
struction  and  for  structure  of  these  materials  as  they  are  being
grown,  and  in  addition,  because  they  are  next  to  light  sources  and
the  Spallation  Neutron  Source,  the  dynamics  of  these  materials  as
well.

Finally,  we  will  be  beginning  construction  of  the  Linac  Coherent
Light  Source  at  Stanford  Linear  Accelerator.  This  will  be  the
brightest  x-ray  source  in  the  world  by  10  billion  times  in  the  hard
x-ray range. That is a range where crystal structures for biological
materials  are  important.  More  importantly,  it  is  so  bright  that  we
will  be  able  to  do  the  structure  of  a  single  macromolecule.  About
half  of  the  proteins  that  we  would  like  to  determine  structures  of
do not crystallize, and so we can not use conventional light sources
for their structure. But we will be able to measure one molecule at
a  time  so  that  we  can  look  at  cell  wall  structures,  for  example,  for
the first time.

In  addition,  this  light  source  is  a  very  fast  source.  Its  timing  is
of  the  order  of  less  than  a  femtosecond,  that  is  10–15 seconds.  It  is
so  fast  that  we  will  be  able  to  see  the  formation  of  the  chemical
bond  as  a  chemical  reaction  is  taking  place.  This  will  mean  that
we  will  be  opening  up  a  whole  new  field  of  science,  namely  ultra-
fast science.

I have just given you a snapshot of where we are making our in-
vestments  so  that  our  scientists  will  have  opportunities  that  no-
body else will have. In this budget climate, it comes at a cost, and
both  of  you  have  outlined  that  cost.  And  it  was  a  choice  that  we
had  to  make  between  the  future.  And  we  made  those  choices
with—difficult  choices.  We  think  they  are  in  the  interest  of  the
country.

Most  of  you  are  ardent  supporters  of  the  Office  of  Science,  and
we are very grateful for that. We believe this budget will maintain
U.S.  scientific  leadership  for  the  future,  and  we  thank  you  very
much for your support.

a sound investment in our nation’s future. Through this budget we will position the
Office of Science to be ready for the opportunities of the next decade.

This  budget,  Madame  Chairman,  will  enable  thousands  of  researchers  located
across  our  nation  to  work  on  some  of  the  most  pressing  scientific  challenges  of  our
age.  These  researchers  will  demonstrate  the  scientific  and  technological  feasibility
of  creating  and  controlling  a  sustained  burning  plasma  to  generate  energy  through
participation in ITER (Latin for the way, ITER is an international fusion collabora-
tion);  use  advanced  computation  and  modeling  tools  to  resolve  complex  scientific
problems;  restore  U.S.  leadership  in  neutron  science  with  the  start  of  operations  at
the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS); expand the frontier of nanotechnology through
operation of Nanoscale Science Research Centers (NSRCs); pursue an understanding
of  how  the  universe  began;  contribute  to  our  understanding  of  climate  change  in-
cluding  the  potential  of  carbon  sequestration;  develop  the  knowledge  that  may  en-
able  us  to  harness  microbes  and  microbial  communities  to  improve  energy  produc-
tion  and  environmental  remediation;  and  contribute  basic  research  that  underpins
the President’s Hydrogen Fuel Initiative.

The  Office  of  Science  requests  $3,462,718,000  for  the  FY  2006  Science  appropria-
tion,  a  decrease  of  $136,828,000  from  the  FY  2005  appropriation,  for  investments
in  basic  research  that  are  critical  to  the  success  of  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)
missions  in  national  security  and  energy  security;  advancement  of  the  frontiers  of
knowledge in the physical sciences and areas of biological, environmental, and com-
putational  sciences;  and  provision  of  world-class  research  facilities  for  the  Nation’s
science enterprise (see Figure 1).

The  Office  of  Science,  within  a  period  of  budget  stringency,  has  chosen  its  prior-
ities so that the U.S. will continue its world primacy in science. We have made the
hard decisions that will enable our scientists to work on the finest machines whose
scale  and  magnitude  will  give  them  opportunities  not  found  elsewhere.  As  a  con-
sequence,  we  have  made  difficult  choices.  But  these  have  been  taken  with  one  end
in mind: the Office of Science will support a world-class program in science and en-
ergy security research with this budget.

This budget request supports the following programs: Basic Energy Sciences, Ad-
vanced  Scientific  Computing  Research,  Biological  and  Environmental  Research,
High  Energy  Physics,  Nuclear  Physics,  Fusion  Energy  Sciences,  Science  Labora-
tories Infrastructure, Science Program Direction, Workforce Development for Teach-
ers and Scientists, and Safeguards and Security.

The  Office  of  Science  supports  research  across  the  scientific  spectrum  from  high
energy  physics  to  biology  and  environmental  research;  from  fusion  energy  sciences
to nuclear physics, from basic energy sciences to advanced scientific computation re-
search. We provide 42 percent of the federal funding for the physical sciences in the
United States, and are the stewards of support for fields such as high energy phys-
ics,  plasma  physics,  catalysis,  and  nuclear  physics.  We  build  and  operate  the  large
scientific  facilities  used  by  over  19,000  faculty,  students,  and  postdocs  each  year.
They  include  synchrotron  light  sources,  neutron  sources,  high  energy  and  nuclear
physics  accelerators,  fusion  energy  experiments,  dedicated  scientific  computing  re-
sources, specialized environmental research capabilities, the Production Genome Fa-
cility,  and  will  soon  include  the  SNS,  five  NSRCs,  and  an  X-ray  free  electron  laser
light  source.  Roughly  half  of  our  budget  goes  to  the  construction  and  operation  of
these facilities; the other half is split, roughly equally, between research at the DOE
laboratories  and  research  at  universities.  This  supports  the  research  of  approxi-
mately 23,500 students, postdocs, and faculty throughout our nation.

FY 2006 SCIENCE PRIORITIES

In his testimony before the House Science Committee, the President’s Science Ad-
viser, Dr. Jack Marburger indicated, ‘‘Making choices is difficult even when budgets
are  generous.  But  tight  budgets  have  the  virtue  of  focusing  on  priorities  and
strengthening  program  management.  This  year’s  R&D  budget  proposal  maintains
levels  of  funding  that  allow  America  to  maintain  its  leadership  position  in  science
and move ahead in selected priority areas.’’

The  priorities  the  Office  of  Science  has  set  within  the  overall  Federal  R&D  effort
and  in  support  of  DOE’s  mission  are  clear:  Through  the  FY  2006  Budget,  we  will
fully support Presidential initiatives in fusion and hydrogen; we will continue strong
support for other Administration priorities such as nanotechnology and information
technology; we will complete—on time and within budget—unique scientific facilities
that  will  maintain  and  enhance  research  in  areas  we  believe  offer  the  greatest  po-
tential  for  broad  advances  in  future  energy  technologies.  These  scientific  facilities
were prioritized in our 20-year facilities outlook, announced in November 2003.

We  will  continue  moving  ahead  with  our  contributions  to  the  President’s  Hydro-
gen Fuel Initiative. We are supporting U.S. participation in the ITER project to pur-
sue the potential of energy from fusion.

One  of  the  biggest  science  stories  of  the  year  2006  will  be  the  start-up  of  the
Spallation  Neutron  Source  at  our  Oak  Ridge  National  Lab,  which  will  provide  the
most  intense—by  an  order  of  magnitude—neutron  beam  in  the  world  for  cutting-
edge research.

The  FY  2006  budget  will  also  bring  four  of  our  five  nanoscale  science  research
centers  on  line,  providing  tools  found  nowhere  else  in  the  world  for  exploration  at
the  atomic  level,  offering  huge  potential  for  the  discovery  of  entirely  new  ways  to
build materials.

We are fully funding construction of the Linac Coherent Light Source at the Stan-
ford  Linear  Accelerator  Center,  a  machine  that  will  produce  x-rays  10  billion  times

brighter  than  any  existing  x-ray  source  on  Earth.  When  it  comes  on  line  in  2009,
it  essentially  will  allow  stop-action  photography  of  atomic  motion.  Just  ask  the
pharmaceutical  industry  what  they  could  do  with  a  machine  that  shows  them  how
the chemical bond forms during a chemical reaction.

The Office of Science also will fully fund the National Energy Research Scientific
Computing Center, a key center for capacity supercomputing used by roughly 2,000
researchers every year, and a separate open-access leadership class computing facil-
ity at Oak Ridge, focused on providing the capability to carry out a limited number
of massive simulations not possible on any other civilian supercomputer in the U.S.
The  Department  will  also  expand  research  underpinning  biotechnology  solutions
to  the  world’s  energy  challenges  and  research  supporting  the  President’s  climate
change science program.

Our research programs in high energy physics continue to receive strong support.
We  have  increased  funding  for  future  accelerators  such  as  the  Large  Hadron
Collider,  scheduled  to  begin  operation  in  2007,  and  the  proposed  International  Lin-
ear Collider, which is now in an early R&D phase. Our nuclear physics program will
continue  to  offer  world-class  facilities  for  use  by  thousands  of  researchers  from
around the world.
SCIENCE ACCOMPLISHMENTS

The  Office  of  Science  has  proven  its  ability  to  deliver  results  over  the  past  50
years.  That  legacy  includes  70  Office  of  Science  sponsored  Nobel  Laureates  since
1954.  Our  science  has  spawned  entire  new  industries,  including  nuclear  medicine
technologies that save thousands of lives each year, and the nuclear power industry
that  now  contributes  20  percent  of  the  power  to  our  nation’s  electricity  grid.  It  has
also  changed  the  way  we  see  the  universe  and  ourselves;  for  example—by  identi-
fying  the  ubiquitous  and  mysterious  ‘‘dark  energy’’  that  is  accelerating  the  expan-
sion  of  the  universe  and  by  sequencing  the  human  genome.  The  Office  of  Science
has  taken  the  lead  on  new  research  challenges,  such  as  bringing  the  power  of
terascale  computing  to  scientific  discovery  and  industrial  competitiveness.  The  Na-
tion’s investment in SC’s basic research programs continues to pay dividends to the
American taxpayer. Some of the past year’s highlights include:

• Promoting  Science  Literacy  and  Fostering  the  Next  Generation  of  DOE  Sci-
entists. In FY 2004, DOE launched a seven-part program named STARS: Sci-
entists Teaching and Reaching Students. This program is designed to enhance
the  training  of  America’s  mathematics  and  science  teachers;  boost  student
achievement  in  science  and  math,  especially  in  the  critical  middle  school
years; and draw attention to the women and men who have done DOE science
so  very  well—and  thereby  encourage  young  people  and  prospective  teachers
to pursue careers in math and science. STARS is a critical step in leveraging
the  resources  of  DOE—and  of  all  our  national  laboratories—to  help  create  a
new generation of scientists who will achieve the scientific breakthroughs and
technological advances so essential to our future security and prosperity.
• Nobel  Prize  in  Physics.  The  2004  Nobel  Prize  in  physics  was  awarded  to
David  J.  Gross  (Kavli  Institute,  UC  Santa  Barbara),  H.  David  Politzer
(Caltech),  and  Frank  Wilczek  (MIT)  for  their  discovery  of  ‘‘asymptotic  free-
dom’’ in the strong force. What they discovered was a surprising fact: as fun-
damental  particles  get  closer  to  each  other,  the  strong  force  between  them
grows weaker, and the further apart they are, the stronger it is, like stretch-
ing  a  rubber  band.  This  discovery  is  a  key  component  of  the  very  successful
Standard  Model  of  particle  physics,  which  describes  three  of  the  four  funda-
mental  forces  of  nature:  electromagnetic,  weak,  and  strong.  Physicists  dream
of extending the theory to include the fourth fundamental force, gravity. The
Office  of  Science  has  supported  the  research  of  Wilczek  since  the  1980’s  at
Princeton  and  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  (MIT)  and  has  sup-
ported Politzer at Caltech from the 1970’s.
• Nobel  Prize  in  Physics.  The  2003  Nobel  Prize  for  Physics  was  shared  by  Ar-
gonne  National  Laboratory  (ANL)  researcher  Alexei  A.  Abrikosov  for  his  pio-
neering  contributions  to  the  theory  of  superconductors.  The  Office  of  Science
has long supported Abrikosov’s work on the mechanisms of high temperature
superconductivity. Amongst the myriad applications of superconducting mate-
rials  are  the  magnets  used  for  magnetic  resonance  imaging,  or  MRI,  and  po-
tential  applications  in  high  efficiency  electricity  transmission  and  high-speed
trains.
• New  Physics  Emerges  From  Quark-Gluon  Plasma.  In  2004,  the  Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) de-
livered gold beams at twice the accelerator design limits and greatly exceeded

25

the expectations of the 1,000-plus international physicists working on the four
experiments  at  RHIC.  The  goal  of  RHIC  is  to  recreate  the  predicted  quark-
gluon plasma, an extremely dense state of matter thought to have last existed
microseconds  after  the  Big  Bang.  RHIC  has  announced  evidence  of  a  quark-
gluon  state  of  matter  at  high  density  and  temperature,  exhibiting  the  prop-
erties  of  a  highly  correlated  liquid—something  new  and  unexpected-  as  well
as  indications  of  a  dense,  weakly  interacting  gluonic  matter  that  has  been
called a ‘‘Color Glass Condensate’’—again something new.
• Wide Acceptance of Open-Source, High-End Cluster Software by Industry and
Users.  The  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  (ORNL)  Open  Source  Cluster  Ap-
plication Resources (OSCAR) computing software for high-end computing con-
tinues to expand its capability and to increase its user base. The software has
been  downloaded  by  more  than  130,000  groups  around  the  world  and  is  pro-
moted by vendors such as Dell and Intel. The adoption of this system has ex-
panded  the  number  of  software  packages  available  to  the  cluster  community,
and  continues  to  reduce  cluster  total  cost  of  ownership.  It  has  simplified  the
job of software authors, system administrators, and ultimately the application
user by providing a timely and much simpler method of supplying and apply-
ing  software  updates.  The  Scientific  Discovery  through  Advanced  Computing
(SciDAC) Scalable Systems Software Integrated Software Infrastructure Cen-
ter  leverages  OSCAR  technology  to  simplify  deployment  for  the  end-user  as
well as application developers.
• Advances  in  Fusion  Energy  Sciences  Contribute  to  ITER.  Efficient  burning  of
the  fusion’s  plasma  fuel,  a  mixture  of  hydrogen  isotopes,  requires  stably  con-
fining  the  plasma  at  temperatures  of  50–100  million  degrees,  comparable  to
those  found  on  the  Sun,  with  magnetic  fields  designed  to  hold  the  plasma  in
place.  Recent  application  of  diagnostics  that  can  measure  the  magnetic  fields
deep  inside  this  highly  energetic  plasma  with  great  precision  and  advanced
computer codes that can model the detailed behavior of the plasma has given
scientists  unprecedented  control  over  the  behavior  of  the  plasma.  Experi-
ments on the DIII–D tokamak have led the way in prototyping future experi-
ments  on  ITER.  Scientists  are  now  able  to  use  feedback  control  systems  to
confidently  operate  the  plasma  at  pressures  which  optimize  the  fusion  power
output  within  a  given  magnetic  field.  In  addition,  experiments  and  the  use
of  massively  parallel  computing  to  benchmark  models  that  validate  a  whole
new  theoretical  understanding  of  how  plasmas  can  be  insulated  from  loss  of
particles  and  energy  give  confidence  that  ITER  can  achieve  the  needed  gain
of  10  (50  Megawatts  of  heating,  500  Megawatts  of  fusion  power  production)
required to enter the burning plasma regime.
• Using DOE Technology and Know-how to Bring Sight to the Blind. DOE’s ar-
tificial  retina  project  is  a  model  for  success  in  an  era  when  the  boundaries
of scientific disciplines, public and private sector roles in science, and federal
agency  responsibilities  are  increasingly  blurred.  Success  has  come  through
the strength of partnerships between scientists in the public and private sec-
tors, spanning scientific disciplines from materials to medicine to engineering
to  surgery,  and  with  funds  from  both  DOE  and  the  National  Institutes  of
Health (NIH). In June 2004, the project reached a major milestone as a sixth
blind patient was successfully implanted with an artificial retina device. One
patient has had the device since February 2002. All six patients can now read
large letters (two-foot large letters one foot away) as well as tell the difference
between  a  paper  cup,  a  plate,  and  a  plastic  knife.  The  patients  can  also  see
colors  although  learning  and  understanding  this  process  is  still  a  challenge
for  both  patients  and  scientists.  Patients  will  soon  begin  using  their  retinal
implants  outside  the  laboratory  and  will  even  be  able  to  use  them  alone  at
home. These initial patient studies are a key part of a Food and Drug Admin-
istration Investigational Device Exemption trial.
• Record  Operations  Advance  Physics  at  the  Frontier.  Both  the  Fermi  National
Accelerator  Laboratory  (Fermilab)  and  the  Stanford  Linear  Accelerator  Cen-
ter (SLAC) set significant new records in data delivery (‘‘luminosity’’) in 2004,
with  the  accelerators  at  each  of  these  centers  more  than  doubling  their  out-
standing performance levels from 2003. On Friday, July 16, the Tevatron pro-
ton-antiproton  collider  at  Fermilab  set  a  new  luminosity  record  of  1  ×  1032
cm¥2 sec¥1.  The  use  of  the  Recycler  and  Accumulator  together  to  maximize
the  number  of  antiprotons  available  for  collisions  helped  to  set  the  new
record.  Since  January  2004,  the  peak  luminosity  of  the  Tevatron  has  in-
creased  100  percent.  The  FY  2004  PEP–II/Babar  run  at  SLAC  ended  as
scheduled on July 31, setting new performance records. Since the SLAC facil-

ity  for  B  meson  research  began  operations  in  1999,  its  accumulated  total
number  of  electron-positron  collisions  (integrated  luminosity)  has  steadily  in-
creased to a level about five times higher than the design performance.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND PERFORMANCE

Underpinning  all  of  SC’s  programs  is  a  fundamental  quest  for  knowledge.  Our
program  history  provides  a  compelling  story  of  how  this  knowledge  has  already
shaped the world around us, and the future appears even more promising.

DOE’s Strategic Plan identifies four strategic goals (one each for defense, energy,
science,  and  the  environment)  and  seven  subordinate  general  goals.  The  Office  of
Science  supports  the  Science  Goals.  Detailing  Office  of  Science  contributions  to
DOE’s  Science  goals  are  27  annual  performance  goals.  Progress  toward  the  annual
goals  is  tracked  quarterly  through  the  Department’s  Joule  system  and  reported  to
the  public  annually  through  the  Department’s  Performance  and  Accountability  Re-
port (PAR).

The  one  Office  of  Science  annual  performance  goal  that  was  not  met  in  FY  2004
was:  ‘‘Focus  usage  of  the  primary  supercomputer  at  the  NERSC  on  capability  com-
puting. 50 percent of the computing time used will be accounted for by computations
that  require  at  least  1/8  of  the  total  resource.’’  The  allocation  process  for  NERSC
resources is based on the potential scientific impact of the work, rather than on how
well  the  work  scales  to  large  numbers  of  processors.  When  we  proposed  this  meas-
ure  we  did  not  understand  the  extent  to  which  users  who  run  large  jobs  also  run
small  jobs.  It  is  critical  for  users  to  be  able  to  run  their  software  at  both  scales  on
the  same  computer  because  it  significantly  simplifies  their  software  management.
Therefore we are reducing the percentage of time dedicated to large jobs at NERSC
to  40  percent.  In  addition,  we  have  tasked  the  NERSC  Users  Group  to  develop
science-based measures to better assess NERSC performance.

As  a  basic  research  program,  the  meaning  and  impact  of  our  performance  goals
may  not  always  be  clear  to  those  outside  the  research  community.  The  Office  of
Science  has  created  a  website  (www.sc.doe.gov/measures)  to  better  communicate
what  we  are  measuring  and  why  it  is  important.  We  are  committed  to  improving
our  performance  information  and  will  soon  be  expanding  the  information  included
on  the  website  and  simplifying  the  interface  so  that  the  program  objectives  and  re-
sults will be accessible to a wide audience.
ORGANIZATION

The OneSC Project was initiated to streamline the Office of Science structure and
improve  operations  across  the  Office  of  Science  complex  in  keeping  with  the  prin-
ciples of the President’s Management Agenda. The first phase of this multiphase ef-
fort is now complete and we have realigned the Office of Science organization struc-
ture  to  establish  a  clear  set  of  integrated  roles  and  responsibilities  for  all  Head-
quarters (HQ) and Field elements (Figure 2). Policy direction, scientific program de-
velopment and management functions were defined as HQ responsibilities. Program
execution, implementation, and support functions were defined as Field responsibil-
ities. The major structural change implemented is the removal of a layer of manage-
ment  from  the  Office  of  Science  Field  structure,  in  effect  removing  the  layer  that
existed between the Office of Science Director and the Site Office Managers located
at  Office  of  Science  laboratories.  In  addition,  the  Chicago  Office  will  now  serve  as
the personnel office for Office of Science employees in HQ. The second phase of the
OneSC  initiative  will  entail  a  reengineering  of  our  business  processes  and  is  in  the
preliminary stages of development.

SCIENCE PROGRAMS
BASIC ENERGY SCIENCES
FY  2005  Comparable  Appropriation—$1,104.6  Million;  FY  2006  Request—$1,146.0
Million

The  Basic  Energy  Sciences  (BES)  program  advances  nanoscale  science  through
atomic-  and  molecular-level  studies  in  materials  sciences  and  engineering,  chem-
istry,  geosciences,  and  energy  biosciences.  BES  also  provides  the  Nation’s  research-
ers with world-class research facilities, including reactor- and accelerator-based neu-
tron  sources,  light  sources  soon  to  include  the  X-ray  free  electron  laser,  nanoscale
science research centers, and micro-characterization centers. These facilities provide
outstanding  capabilities  for  imaging  and  characterizing  materials  of  all  kinds  from
metals, alloys, and ceramics to fragile biological samples. The next steps in the char-
acterization and the ultimate control of materials properties and chemical reactivity
are to improve spatial resolution of imaging techniques; to enable a wide variety of
samples, sample sizes, and sample environments to be used in imaging experiments;
and  to  make  measurements  on  very  short  time  scales,  comparable  to  the  time  of  a
chemical  reaction  or  the  formation  of  a  chemical  bond.  With  these  tools,  we  will  be
able  to  understand  how  the  composition  of  materials  affects  their  properties,  to
watch  proteins  fold,  to  see  chemical  reactions,  and  to  understand  and  observe  the
nature  of  the  chemical  bond.  Theory,  modeling,  and  computer  simulations  will  also
play  a  major  role  in  achieving  these  outcomes  and  will  be  a  companion  to  experi-
mental work. Also supported is basic research aimed at advancing hydrogen produc-
tion, storage, and use for the coming hydrogen economy.

FY 2006 will mark the completion of construction and the initial operation of the
Spallation  Neutron  Source  (SNS).  The  SNS  will  be  significantly  more  powerful  (by
about a factor of 10) than the best spallation neutron source now in existence—ISIS
at  the  Rutherford  Laboratory  in  England.  We  estimate  the  facility  will  be  used  by
1,000–2,000  scientists  and  engineers  annually  from  academia,  national  and  federal
labs,  and  industry  for  basic  and  applied  research  and  for  technology  development.
The high neutron flux (i.e., high neutron intensity) from the SNS will enable broad
classes of experiments that cannot be done with today’s low flux sources. For exam-
ple,  high  flux  enables  studies  of  small  samples,  complex  molecules  and  structures,
time-dependent  phenomena,  and  very  weak  interactions.  The  FY  2006  budget  au-
thority  request  completes  funding  for  the  SNS  Project.  This  will  involve  procure-
ment  and  installation  of  equipment  for  instrument  systems,  completion  of  an  accel-

erator readiness review, commissioning of ring and target systems, and meeting all
requirements to begin operations; and all SNS facilities will be turned over to oper-
ations. The estimated Total Project Cost remains constant at $1,411,700,000.

Operations  will  begin  in  FY  2006  at  four  of  the  five  NSRCs:  the  Center  for
Nanophase  Materials  at  ORNL,  the  Molecular  Foundry  at  Lawrence  Berkeley  Na-
tional  Laboratory  (LBNL),  the  Center  for  Integrated  Nanotechnologies  at  Sandia
National Laboratories/Los Alamos National Laboratory (SNL/LANL), and the Center
for  Nanoscale  Materials  at  ANL.  The  exception  is  the  Center  for  Functional
Nanomaterials  at  BNL,  which  is  scheduled  to  begin  operations  in  FY  2008.  The
NSRCs  are  user  facilities  for  the  synthesis,  processing,  fabrication,  and  analysis  of
materials at the nanoscale. They are designed to promote rapid advances in the var-
ious areas of nanoscale science and technology and are part of the DOE contribution
to the National Nanotechnology Initiative. The NSRCs are sited adjacent to or near
existing  BES  synchrotron  or  neutron  scattering  facilities  to  enable  rapid  character-
ization  of  newly  fabricated  materials.  FY  2006  funds  are  requested  for  construction
of  NSRCs  located  at  LBNL,  at  SNL/LANL,  and  at  BNL.  Funds  are  also  requested
to complete the Major Item of Equipment (MIE) for the NSRC at ANL.

The  Linac  Coherent  Light  Source  (LCLS)  will  continue  Project  Engineering  De-
sign (PED) and FY 2006 budget authority is requested to initiate physical construc-
tion  of  the  LCLS  conventional  facilities.  Funding  will  be  provided  separately  for
preconceptual  design  of  instruments  for  the  facility.  BES  funding  will  also  be  pro-
vided  to  partially  support,  in  conjunction  with  the  High  Energy  Physics  program,
operation of the SLAC linac. This will mark the beginning of the transition to LCLS
operations  at  SLAC.  The  LCLS  project  will  provide  the  world’s  first  demonstration
of  an  x-ray  free-electron-laser  (FEL)  in  the  1.5–15  A˚
(angstrom)  range,  10  billion
times  greater  in  peak  power  and  peak  brightness  than  any  existing  coherent  x-ray
light  source,  and  that  has  pulse  lengths  measured  in  femtoseconds,  the  timescale
of  electronic  and  atomic  motions.  The  advance  in  brightness  is  similar  to  that  of  a
synchrotron  over  a  1960’s  laboratory  x-ray  tube.  Synchrotrons  have  revolutionized
science  across  disciplines  ranging  from  atomic  physics  to  structural  biology.  Ad-
vances  from  the  LCLS  are  expected  to  be  even  more  dramatic.  The  LCLS  project
leverages capital investments in the existing SLAC linac as well as technologies de-
veloped  for  linear  colliders  and  for  the  production  of  intense  electron  beams  with
radio-frequency photocathode guns. The availability of the SLAC linac for the LCLS
project  creates  a  unique  opportunity  for  demonstration  and  use  of  x-ray  FEL  radi-
ation. The estimated Total Project Cost is $379,000,000.

The  FY  2006  budget  supports  a  Major  Item  of  Equipment  (MIE)  for  the  Trans-
mission Electron Aberration-corrected Microscope (TEAM). The Total Project Cost is
in  the  range  of  $25,000,000  to  $30,000,000.  The  TEAM  project  will  construct  and
operate  a  new  aberration-corrected  electron  microscope 
for  materials  and
nanoscience  research.  The  projected  improvement  in  spatial  resolution,  contrast,
sensitivity,  and  flexibility  of  design  of  electron  optical  instruments  will  provide  un-
precedented  opportunities  to  observe  directly  the  atomic-scale  order,  electronic
structure, and dynamics of individual nanoscale structures.

Research  to  realize  the  potential  of  a  hydrogen  economy  will  be  increased  from
$29,183,000  to  $32,500,000.  This  research  program  is  based  on  the  BES  workshop
report Basic Research Needs for the Hydrogen Economy. The 2003 report highlights
the enormous gap between our present capabilities for hydrogen production, storage,
and use and those required for a competitive hydrogen economy. To be economically
competitive  with  the  present  fossil  fuel  economy,  the  cost  of  fuel  cells  must  be  low-
ered  by  a  factor  of  five  and  the  cost  of  producing  hydrogen  must  be  lowered  by  a
factor  of  four.  Moreover,  the  performance  and  reliability  of  hydrogen  technology  for
transportation  and  other  uses  must  be  improved  dramatically.  Simple  incremental
advances  in  the  present  state-of-the-art  cannot  bridge  this  gap.  Narrowing  the  gap
significantly is the goal of a comprehensive, long-range program of innovative high-
risk/high-payoff  basic  research  that  is  intimately  coupled  to  and  coordinated  with
the DOE’s applied programs.

In  order  to  accomplish  these  very  high-priority,  forefront  activities,  some  difficult
choices had to be made. In particular, the BES support for the Radiochemical Engi-
neering and Development Center at ORNL will be terminated. The operations budg-
ets of the remaining facilities will be at about the same level as in FY 2005, decreas-
ing  available  beam  time  and  service  for  users.  Core  funding  for  university  and  na-
tional laboratory researchers decreases 7.8 percent compared to the FY 2005 appro-
priation.  While  no  research  activities  will  be  terminated,  there  will  be  reductions
throughout.

ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING RESEARCH
FY 2005 Comparable Appropriation—$232.5 Million; FY 2006 Request—$207.1 Mil-
lion

The  Advanced  Scientific  Computing  Research  (ASCR)  program  significantly  ad-
vances scientific simulation and computation, applying new approaches, algorithms,
and  software  and  hardware  combinations  to  address  the  critical  science  challenges
of  the  future.  ASCR  also  provides  access  to  world-class  scientific  computation  and
networking  facilities  to  the  Nation’s  scientific  community  to  support  advancements
in  practically  every  field  of  science.  ASCR  will  continue  to  advance  the  trans-
formation  of  scientific  simulation  and  computation  into  the  third  pillar  of  scientific
discovery,  enabling  scientists  to  look  inside  an  atom  or  across  a  galaxy;  and  inside
a  chemical  reaction  that  takes  a  millionth  of  a  billionth  of  a  second  or  across  a  cli-
mate change process that lasts for a thousand years. In addition, ASCR will shrink
the distance between scientists and the resources—experiments, data, and other sci-
entists—they  need,  and  accelerate  scientific  discovery  by  making  interactions  that
used to take months happen on a much shorter timescale.

The  Mathematical,  Information,  and  Computational  Sciences  (MICS)  effort  is  re-
sponsible  for  carrying  out  the  primary  mission  of  the  ASCR  program.  In  addition,
MICS research underpins the success of SciDAC. MICS supports both basic research
and the development of the results from this basic research into software usable by
scientists  in  other  disciplines.  MICS  also  supports  partnerships  with  scientific  dis-
cipline  users  to  test  the  usefulness  of  the  research—facilitating  the  transfer  of  re-
search  and  helping  to  define  promising  areas  for  future  research.  This  integrated
approach  is  critical  for  MICS  to  succeed  in  providing  the  extraordinary  computa-
tional  and  communications  tools  that  DOE’s  civilian  programs  need  to  carry  out
their missions.

Major  elements  of  the  ASCR  portfolio  related  to  the  SciDAC  will  be  re-competed
in FY 2006, with attention paid to support for the long-term maintenance and sup-
port  of  software  tools  such  as  mathematical  libraries,  adaptive  mesh  refinement
software, and scientific data management tools developed in the first 5 years of the
effort.  In  addition,  in  FY  2006  ASCR  is  changing  the  way  in  which  it  manages  its
Genomics:  GTL  partnership  with  the  Biological  and  Environmental  Research  pro-
gram.  The  management  of  these  efforts  will  be  integrated  into  the  portfolio  of  suc-
cessful  SciDAC  partnerships.  The  FY  2006  budget  request  includes  $7,500,000  for
continued support of the Genomics: GTL research program. The FY 2006 budget re-
quest  also  includes  $2,600,000  for  the  Nanoscale  Science,  Engineering  and  Tech-
nology  initiative  led  by  BES,  and  $1,350,000  for  support  of  the  Fusion  Simulation
Project,  led  by  the  Fusion  Energy  Sciences  program.  ASCR’s  contributions  to  these
partnerships will consist of advancing the mathematics and developing new mathe-
matical  algorithms  to  simulate  biological  systems  and  physical  systems  at  the
nanoscale.  The  FY  2006  budget  request  also  provides  $8,000,000  to  initiate  a  small
number  of  competitively  selected  SciDAC  institutes  at  universities  which  can  be-
come centers of excellence in high end computational science in areas that are crit-
ical to DOE missions.

The  FY  2006  budget  also  includes  $8,500,000  to  continue  the  ‘‘Atomic  to  Macro-
scopic  Mathematics’’  (AMM)  research  support  in  applied  mathematics  needed  to
break  through  the  current  barriers  in  our  understanding  of  complex  physics  proc-
esses  that  occur  on  a  wide  range  of  interacting  length-  and  timescales.  Achieving
this basic mathematical understanding will provide enabling technology to virtually
every challenging computational problem faced by SC.

The National Leadership Computing Facility acquired under the Next Generation
Architecture (NGA) Leadership Class Computing Competition in FY 2004 will be op-
erated  to  provide  high  performance  production  capability  to  selected  Office  of
Science researchers. The NGA effort will play a critical role in enabling Leadership
Class  Machines  that  could  lead  to  solutions  for  scientific  problems  beyond  what
would  be  attainable  through  a  continued  simple  extrapolation  of  current  computa-
tional capabilities. NGA will continue its focus on research in operating systems and
systems  software  and  will  initiate  a  new  competition  for  Research  and  Evaluation
Prototype  Computer  testbeds.  ASCR  research  efforts  in  Collaboratory  Tools  and  Pi-
lots  and  Networking  will  be  restructured  into  an  integrated  Distributed  Network
Environment  activity  focused  on  basic  research  in  computer  networks  and  the
middleware  needed  to  make  these  networks  tools  for  science.  This  change  will  en-
able the reduced NGA effort to operate computers acquired in FY 2004 and FY 2005
at  the  ORNL–Center  for  Computational  Sciences  (CCS)  as  tools  for  science  and  es-
pecially  to  satisfy  the  demand  for  resources  that  has  resulted  from  the  successful
SciDAC efforts.

BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
FY 2005 Comparable Appropriation—$581.9 Million; FY 2006 Request—$455.7 Mil-
lion

The  Biological  and  Environmental  Research  (BER)  program  advances  energy-re-
lated  biological  and  environmental  research  in  genomics  and  our  understanding  of
complete biological systems, such as microbes that produce hydrogen; develops mod-
els  to  predict  climate  over  decades  to  centuries;  develops  science-based  methods  for
cleaning  up  environmental  contaminants;  provides  regulators  with  a  stronger  sci-
entific basis for developing future radiation protection standards; and develops new
diagnostic  and  therapeutic  tools,  technology  for  disease  diagnosis  and  treatment,
non-invasive  medical  imaging,  and  biomedical  engineering  such  as  an  artificial  ret-
ina that is restoring sight to the blind.

The FY 2006 budget includes funds for the continued expansion of the Genomics:
GTL program—a program at the forefront of the biological revolution. This program
employs  a  systems  approach  to  biology  at  the  interface  of  the  biological,  physical,
and computational sciences to address DOE’s energy, environment, and national se-
curity  mission  needs.  This  research  will  continue  to  more  fully  characterize  the  in-
ventory  of  multi-protein  molecular  machines  found  in  selected  DOE-relevant  mi-
crobes  and  higher  organisms.  It  will  determine  the  diverse  biochemical  capabilities
of microbes and microbial communities, especially as they relate to potential biologi-
cal  solutions  to  DOE  needs,  found  in  populations  of  microbes  isolated  from  DOE-
relevant  sites.  Support  for  Microbial  Genomics  research  as  a  separate  research  ac-
tivity  is  terminated  to  consolidate  all  microbial  research  within  Genomics:  GTL.
Support of structural biology, human genome, and health effects research is also re-
duced to support GTL research. GTL research will provide the scientific community
with knowledge, resources, and tools that benefit large numbers of research projects
with positive impacts on more scientists and students than are negatively impacted
by the initial reduction.

In  2003,  the  Administration  launched  the  Climate  Change  Research  Initiative
(CCRI) to focus research on areas where substantial progress in understanding and
predicting  climate  change,  including  its  causes  and  consequences,  is  possible  over
the  next  five  years.  In  FY  2006,  BER  will  contribute  to  the  CCRI  from  four  pro-
grams: Terrestrial Carbon Processes, Climate Change Prediction, Atmospheric Radi-
ation Measurement (ARM), and Integrated Assessment. Activities will be focused on
(1)  helping  to  resolve  the  magnitude  and  location  of  the  North  American  carbon
sink; (2) deploying and operating of a mobile ARM Cloud and Radiation Testbed fa-
cility  to  provide  data  on  the  effects  of  clouds  and  aerosols  on  the  atmospheric  radi-
ation  budget  in  regions  and  locations  of  opportunity  where  data  are  lacking  or
sparse;  (3)  using  advanced  climate  models  to  simulate  potential  effects  of  natural
and human-induced climate forcing on global and regional climate and the potential
effects  on  climate  of  alternative  options  for  mitigating  increases  in  human  forcing
of climate; and (4) developing and evaluating assessment tools needed to study costs
and benefits of potential strategies for reducing net carbon dioxide emissions.

The completion of the International Human Genome Project and the transition of
BER’s  Human  Genome  research  program  from  a  human  DNA  sequencing  program
to  a  DNA  sequencing  user  resource  for  the  scientific  community  which  focuses  on
the  sequencing  of  scientifically  important  microbes,  plants,  and  animals  will  bring
BER’s  Human  Genome  Ethical,  Legal,  and  Societal  Issues  (ELSI)  program  to  an
end. In FY 2006, ELSI research will include activities applicable to Office of Science
issues in biotechnology and nanotechnology such as environmental or human health
concerns associated with Genomics: GTL or nanotechnology research. Research with
these funds will be coordinated across the Office of Science.

BER  will  focus  FY  2006  research  activities  on  higher  priorities,  including  GTL
and Climate Change Research, in support of DOE goals and objectives. Funding re-
ductions are initiated in the Environmental Remediation Research subprogram and
the  Medical  Applications  and  Measurement  Science  Research  subprogram.  Accord-
ingly, some current research activities will be phased out in FY 2005. Based on find-
ings of the BER Committee of Visitors for the Environmental Remediation Research
subprogram, research activities are integrated into a single program to increase the
efficiency of the activities and to better address the BER long-term goals in environ-
mental remediation research.

The  High  Energy  Physics  (HEP)  program  provides  over  90  percent  of  the  federal
support  for  the  Nation’s  high  energy  physics  research.  This  research  advances  our
understanding of dark energy and dark matter, the lack of symmetry in the current
universe, the basic constituents of matter, and the possible existence of other dimen-
sions,  collectively  revealing  key  secrets  of  the  universe.  HEP  expands  the  energy
frontier  with  particle  accelerators  to  study  fundamental  interactions  at  the  highest
possible  energies,  which  may  reveal  new  particles,  new  forces,  or  undiscovered  di-
mensions of space and time; explain the origin of mass; and illuminate the pathway
to  the  underlying  simplicity  of  the  universe.  At  the  same  time,  the  HEP  program
sheds  new  light  on  other  mysteries  of  the  cosmos,  uncovering  what  holds  galaxies
together  and  what  is  pushing  the  universe  apart;  understanding  why  there  is  any
matter  in  the  universe  at  all;  and  exposing  how  the  tiniest  constituents  of  the  uni-
verse may have the largest role in shaping its birth, growth, and ultimate fate.

The HEP program in FY 2006 will continue to lead the world with forefront user
facilities  producing  data  that  help  answer  key  scientific  questions,  but  these  facili-
ties  will  complete  their  scientific  missions  by  the  end  of  the  decade.  Thus,  we  have
structured  the  FY  2006  HEP  program  not  only  to  maximize  the  scientific  returns
on  our  investment  in  these  facilities,  but  also  to  invest  in  R&D  now  for  the  most
promising new facilities that will come online in the next decade. This has required
a  prioritization  of  our  current  R&D  efforts  to  select  those  which  will  provide  the
most  compelling  science  within  the  available  resources.  In  making  these  decisions
we  have  seriously  considered  the  recommendations  of  the  High  Energy  Physics  Ad-
visory Panel (HEPAP) and planning studies produced by the U.S. HEP community.
This prioritization process will continue as the R&D programs evolve.

Because of its broad relevance in addressing many of the long-term goals of HEP,
and  its  unique  potential  for  new  discoveries,  the  highest  priority  is  given  to  the
planned  operations,  upgrades  and  infrastructure  for  the  Tevatron  program  at
Fermilab.  This  includes  the  completion  of  the  upgrade  to  the  Tevatron  accelerator
complex  in  2007  to  provide  increased  luminosity  and  additional  computational  re-
sources  to  support  analysis  of  the  anticipated  larger  volume  of  data.  Over  the  last
few  years,  the  laboratory  has  developed  and  implemented  a  detailed,  resource-load-
ed plan for Tevatron operations and improvements, which has resulted in more reli-
able  luminosity  projections.  The  Office  of  Science  has  reviewed  the  plan  and  is  ac-
tively engaged in tracking its progress.

The FY 2006 request supports initial operations of the Neutrinos at the Main In-
jector  (NuMI)  project  at  Fermilab,  which  has  just  completed  construction  and  will
study  the  puzzling  but  fundamental  physics  of  neutrino  masses  and  mixings.  The
NuMI  beam  operates  in  parallel  with  the  Tevatron,  also  at  Fermilab,  currently  the
highest energy accelerator in the world.

In  order  to  fully  exploit  the  unique  opportunity  to  expand  our  understanding  of
the  asymmetry  of  matter  and  antimatter  in  the  universe,  a  high  priority  is  given
to  the  operations,  upgrades  and  infrastructure  for  the  B-factory  at  SLAC.  Support
for  B-factory  will  include  an  allowance  for  increased  power  costs  and  fully  funded
upgrades for the accelerator and detector which are currently scheduled for comple-
tion in 2006. This includes the completion of the upgrade to the accelerator complex
and BaBar detector to provide more data; additional computational resources to sup-
port  analysis  of  the  larger  volume  of  data;  and,  increased  infrastructure  spending
to improve reliability. Funding for SLAC operations includes support from the BES
program for the LCLS project, marking the beginning of the transition of Linac op-
erations  from  HEP  to  BES  as  B-factory  operations  are  terminated  by  FY  2008  at
the latest.

As the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) accelerator in Europe nears its turn-on date
of  2007,  U.S.  activities  related  to  fabrication  of  detector  components  will  be  com-
pleted  and  new  activities  related  to  commissioning  and  pre-operations  of  these  de-
tectors,  along  with  software  and  computing  activities  needed  to  analyze  the  data,
will  ramp-up  significantly.  Support  of  a  leadership  role  for  U.S.  research  groups  in
the  LHC  physics  program  will  continue  to  be  a  high  priority  for  the  HEP  program.
In  order  to  explore  the  nature  of  dark  energy,  pre-conceptual  R&D  for  potential
interagency sponsored experiments with NASA will continue in FY 2006. These ex-
periments  will  provide  important  new  information  about  the  nature  of  dark  energy
and  dark  matter  that  will  in  turn  lead  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  birth,  evo-
lution  and  ultimate  fate  of  the  universe.  At  this  time,  no  funding  for  a  space-based
DOE/NASA Joint Dark Energy Mission past the pre-conceptual stage has been iden-
tified.

The  engineering  design  of  the  BTeV  (‘‘B  Physics  at  the  Tevatron’’)  experiment,
which  was  scheduled  to  begin  in  FY  2005  as  a  new  Major  Item  of  Equipment,  is
cancelled.  This  is  consistent  with  the  guidance  of  HEPAP  which  rated  BTeV  as  of
lesser  scientific  potential  than  other  projects,  although  still  important  scientifically

and  of  the  Particle  Physics  Project  Prioritization  Panel  (P5)  which  supported  BTeV
but  only  if  it  could  be  completed  by  2010,  which  is  not  feasible  given  schedule  and
funding constraints.

The Linear Collider has been judged to be of the highest scientific importance by
HEPAP  as  well  as  by  scientific  advisory  bodies  of  the  Asian  and  European  HEP
communities. In order to address the opportunity for significant new future research
options,  R&D  in  support  of  an  international  electron-positron  linear  collider  is  in-
creased relative to FY 2005 to support the continued international participation and
leadership in linear collider R&D and planning by U.S. scientists.

Recent  discoveries  and  studies  have  pointed  to  neutrinos  as  being  an  extremely
important area of research for deepening our understanding of the nature of matter
and  the  structure  of  the  universe,  and  HEP  is  working  with  the  Nuclear  Physics
program  and  the  National  Science  Foundation  to  plan  a  coordinated  program  in
neutrino  physics.  To  provide  a  nearer-term  future  program,  and  to  preserve  future
research  options,  R&D  for  other  new  accelerator  and  detector  technologies,  particu-
larly in the emerging area of neutrino physics, will increase.
NUCLEAR PHYSICS
FY 2005 Comparable Appropriation—$404.8 Million; FY 2006 Request—$370.7 Mil-
lion

The  Nuclear  Physics  (NP)  program  is  the  major  sponsor  of  fundamental  nuclear
physics  research  in  the  Nation,  providing  about  90  percent  of  federal  support.  NP
builds and operates world-leading scientific facilities and state-of-the-art instrumen-
tation  to  study  the  evolution  and  structure  of  nuclear  matter,  from  the  smallest
building  blocks,  quarks  and  gluons,  to  the  stable  elements  in  the  Universe  created
by  stars  and  to  understand  how  the  quarks  and  gluons  combine  to  form  the
nucleons (proton and neutron), what are the properties and behavior of nuclear mat-
ter  under  extreme  conditions  of  temperature  and  pressure,  and  what  are  the  prop-
erties and reaction rates for atomic nuclei up to their limits of stability. Results and
insight  from  these  studies  are  relevant  to  understanding  how  the  universe  evolved
in its earliest moments, how the chemical elements were formed, and how the prop-
erties  of  one  of  nature’s  basic  constituents,  the  neutrino,  influences  astrophysics
phenomena  such  as  supernovae.  Scientific  discoveries  at  the  frontiers  of  nuclear
physics  further  the  Nation’s  energy  related  research  capacity,  in  turn  contributing
to  the  Nation’s  security,  economic  growth  and  opportunities,  and  improved  quality
of life.

In  FY  2006  the  NP  program  will  operate  world-leading  user  facilities  and  make
investments that will produce data and develop the research capabilities to achieve
the  scientific  goals  discussed  above.  The  Budget  Request  reflects  a  balance  in  on-
going facility operations and research support, and investments in capabilities. The
FY 2006 budget request provides the resources to operate the program’s user facili-
ties  at  65  percent  of  optimum  utilization  with  investments  allocated  so  as  to  opti-
mize  their  scientific  programs.  FY  2006  investments  in  capital  equipment  address
opportunities identified in the 2002 Long Range Plan of the Nuclear Sciences Advi-
sory Committee (NSAC) and in subsequent recommendations.

In  FY  2006  the  Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider’s  (RHIC)  beams  of  relativistic
heavy ions will be used by approximately 1000 scientists to continue the exploration
of  the  nature  of  hot,  dense  matter  and  to  recreate  conditions  under  which  nuclear
matter dissolves into the predicted quark-gluon plasma. RHIC started operations in
FY 2000 and its first 3 runs have produced over 70 refereed journal papers, creating
great interest in the scientific community with the observation of a new state of nu-
clear matter. In FY 2006 funds are provided for accelerator improvements that will
increase  accelerator  reliability  and  reduce  costs,  for  detector  upgrades  needed  to
characterize  the  new  state  of  matter  observed  and  for  Research  and  Development
to increase the luminosity of the collider. These investments are important for opti-
mizing the scientific research and productivity of the facility. These investments are
made  at  the  expense  of  operating  time.  FY  2006  funding  will  support  1,400  hours
of  operations,  a  31  percent  utilization  of  the  collider.  Effective  operation  will  be
achieved  by  combining  FY  2006–FY  2007  running  into  a  single  back-to-back  run
bridging the two Fiscal Years.

Operations  of  the  Thomas  Jefferson  National  Accelerator  Facility  (TJNAF)  in  FY
2006  will  continue  to  advance  our  knowledge  of  the  internal  structure  of  protons
and  neutrons,  the  basic  constituents  of  all  nuclear  matter.  By  providing  precision
experimental  information  concerning  the  quarks  and  gluons  that  form  the  protons
and  neutrons,  the  approximately  1,000  experimental  researchers,  together  with  re-
searchers  in  nuclear  theory,  seek  to  provide  a  quantitative  description  of  nuclear
matter  in  terms  of  the  fundamental  theory  of  the  strong  interaction,  Quantum

ChromoDynamics.  In  FY  2006  funds  are  provided  to  continue  R&D  activities  for  a
potential  12  GeV  Upgrade  of  the  Continuous  Electron  Beam  Accelerator  Facility
(CEBAF).  These  investments  will  poise  the  facility  for  a  cost-effective  upgrade  that
would  allow  insight  on  the  mechanism  of  ‘‘quark  confinement’’—one  of  the  compel-
ling unanswered puzzles of physics.

In the FY 2006 request funds are provided for the operation of the Argonne Tan-
dem  Linac  Accelerator  System  (ATLAS)  at  ANL  and  the  Holifield  Radioactive  Ion
Beam Facility (HRIBF) at ORNL, for studies of nuclear reactions, structure and fun-
damental  interactions.  Included  in  this  funding  are  capital  equipment  and  accel-
erator  improvement  project  funds  provided  to  each  facility  for  the  enhancement  of
the  accelerator  systems  and  experimental  equipment.  These  low  energy  facilities
will  carry  out  about  80  experiments  in  FY  2006  involving  about  300  U.S.  and  for-
eign researchers.

In  FY  2006,  funds  are  provided  to  continue  the  fabrication  of  a  next  generation
gamma-ray  detector  array  (GRETINA)  and  of  the  Fundamental  Neutron  Physics
Beamline (FNPB) at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) that will provide the U.S.
with  world-leader  capabilities  in  nuclear  structure  and  fundamental  neutron  stud-
ies, respectively. Support continues for completion of the important neutrino experi-
ments at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) and KamLAND.

The research programs at the major user facilities are integrated partnerships be-
tween  DOE  scientific  laboratories  and  the  university  community,  and  the  planned
experimental  research  activities  are  considered  essential  for  scientific  productivity
of  the  facilities.  Funding  for  university  and  national  laboratory  researchers  and
graduate students decreases 6.8 percent compared to the FY 2005 appropriation.

While  we  have  a  relatively  good  understanding  of  the  origin  of  the  chemical  ele-
ments  in  the  cosmos  lighter  than  iron,  the  production  of  the  elements  from  iron  to
uranium  remains  a  puzzle.  The  proposed  Rare  Isotope  Accelerator  (RIA)  would  en-
able  study  of  exotic  nuclei  at  the  very  limits  of  stability,  advancing  our  knowledge
of  how  the  elements  formed.  In  FY  2006,  R&D  activities  for  the  proposed  RIA  are
maintained at the FY 2005 Congressional budget request level.
FUSION ENERGY SCIENCES
FY 2005 Comparable Appropriation—$273.9 Million; FY 2006 Request—$290.6 Mil-
lion

The  Fusion  Energy  Sciences  (FES)  program  advances  the  theoretical  and  experi-
mental  understanding  of  plasma  and  fusion  science,  including  a  close  collaboration
with  international  partners  in  identifying  and  exploring  plasma  and  fusion  physics
issues through specialized facilities. This includes: 1) exploring basic issues in plas-
ma science; 2) developing the scientific basis and computational tools to predict the
behavior  of  magnetically  confined  plasmas;  3)  using  the  advances  in  tokamak  re-
search to enable the initiation of the burning plasma physics phase of the FES pro-
gram;  4)  exploring  innovative  confinement  options  that  offer  the  potential  of  more
attractive fusion energy sources in the long-term; 5) focusing on the scientific issues
of nonneutral plasma physics and High Energy Density Physics (HEDP); and 6) de-
veloping  the  cutting  edge  technologies  that  enable  fusion  facilities  to  achieve  their
scientific  goals.  FES  also  leads  U.S.  participation  in  ITER,  an  experiment  to  study
and  demonstrate  the  sustained  burning  of  fusion  fuel.  This  international  collabora-
tion will provide an unparalleled scientific research opportunity with a goal of dem-
onstrating the scientific and technical feasibility of fusion power.

The FY 2006 request is $290,550,000, an increase of $16,647,000, 6.1 percent over
the FY 2005 Appropriation. The FY 2006 budget continues the redirection of the fu-
sion  program  to  prepare  for  and  participate  in  the  ITER  project.  The  ITER  Inter-
national  Agreement  is  currently  being  negotiated  and  is  expected  to  be  completed
by  the  end  of  FY  2005.  FY  2006  FES  funding  of  $49,500,000  is  for  the  startup  of
the U.S. Contributions to ITER MIE. The total U.S. Contributions to the ITER MIE,
$1,122,000,000,  supports  the  fabrication  of  the  equipment,  provision  of  personnel,
limited  cash  for  the  U.S.  share  of  common  project  expenses  at  the  ITER  site,  and
ITER procurements. This MIE is augmented by the technical output from a signifi-
cant  portion  of  the  U.S.  Fusion  Energy  Sciences  community  research  program.  Vir-
tually the entire FES program provides related contributions to such ITER relevant
research and prepares the U.S. for effective participation in ITER when it starts op-
erations.

Within the overall priorities of the FY 2006 FES budget, $15,900,000 is requested
for  the  National  Compact  Stellarator  Experiment  (NCSX),  a  joint  ORNL/Princeton
Plasma  Physics  Laboratory  (PPPL)  advanced  stellarator  experiment  being  built  at
PPPL.  This  fusion  confinement  concept  has  the  potential  to  be  operated  without
plasma  disruptions,  leading  to  power  plant  designs  that  are  simpler  and  more  reli-

able than those based on the current lead concept, the tokamak. FY 2006 operation
of the three major fusion research facilities will be reduced from a total of 48 weeks
to 17 weeks.

FY 2006 funding for the Inertial Fusion Energy/High Energy Density Physics pro-
gram  is  $8,086,000,  a  reduction  of  $7,255,000  from  the  FY  2005  level.  This  will  be
accomplished by reducing the level of research on heavy ion beams. In addition, the
Materials Research program will be eliminated in favor of utilizing the general BES
materials effort for scientific advances in areas of fusion interest.
SCIENCE LABORATORIES INFRASTRUCTURE
FY 2005 Comparable Appropriation—$42.0 Million; FY 2006 Request—$40.1 Million
The mission of the Science Laboratories Infrastructure (SLI) program is to enable
the conduct of DOE research missions at the Office of Science laboratories by fund-
ing  line  item  construction  projects  to  maintain  the  general  purpose  infrastructure
and the clean up for reuse or removal of excess facilities. The program also supports
Office of Science landlord responsibilities for the 24,000 acre Oak Ridge Reservation
and  provides  Payments  in  Lieu  of  Taxes  (PILT)  to  local  communities  around  ANL–
East, BNL, and ORNL.

In  FY  2006,  General  Plant  Projects  (GPP)  funding  is  requested  to  refurbish  and
rehabilitate the general purpose infrastructure necessary to perform cutting edge re-
search  throughout  the  Office  of  Science  laboratory  complex.  FY  2006  funding  of
$3,000,000  is  requested  to  support  continued  design  of  the  Pacific  Northwest  Na-
tional  Laboratory  (PNNL)  Capabilities  Replacement  Laboratory  project.  Funding  of
$11,046,000 is requested to accelerate decontamination and decommissioning (D&D)
of the Bevatron Complex at the LBNL.

No  funding  is  requested  under  the  Health  and  Safety  Improvements  subprogram
to  continue  health  and  safety  improvements  at  the  Office  of  Science  laboratories
identified in the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) and Nuclear
Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  reviews.  If  the  Administration  determines  that
health and safety issues remain, resources will be requested in future years as nec-
essary.
SCIENCE PROGRAM DIRECTION
FY 2005 Comparable Appropriation—$153.7 Million; FY 2006 Request—$162.7 Mil-
lion

Science  Program  Direction  (SCPD)  enables  a  skilled,  highly  motivated  federal
workforce to manage the Office of Science’s basic and applied research portfolio, pro-
grams,  projects,  and  facilities  in  support  of  new  and  improved  energy,  environ-
mental, and health technologies. SCPD consists of two subprograms: Program Direc-
tion and Field Operations.

The  Program  Direction  subprogram  is  the  single  funding  source  for  the  Office  of
Science  federal  staff  in  headquarters  responsible  for  managing,  directing,  admin-
istering,  and  supporting  the  broad  spectrum  of  Office  of  Science  disciplines.  This
subprogram  includes  planning  and  analysis  activities,  providing  the  capabilities
needed  to  plan,  evaluate,  and  communicate  the  scientific  excellence,  relevance,  and
performance of the Office of Science basic research programs. Additionally, Program
Direction  includes  funding  for  the  Office  of  Scientific  and  Technical  Information
(OSTI) which collects, preserves, and disseminates research and development (R&D)
information of the Department of Energy (DOE) for use by DOE, the scientific com-
munity,  academia,  U.S.  industry,  and  the  public  to  expand  the  knowledge  base  of
science  and  technology.  The  Field  Operations  subprogram  is  the  funding  source  for
the  federal  workforce  in  the  Field  responsible  for  management  and  administrative
functions performed within the Chicago and Oak Ridge Operations Offices, and site
offices supporting the Office of Science laboratories and facilities.
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS AND SCIENTISTS
FY  2005  Comparable  Appropriation—$7.6  Million;  FY  2006  Request—$7.2  Million
The  mission  of  the  Workforce  Development  for  Teachers  and  Scientists  (WDTS)
program is to provide a continuum of educational opportunities to the Nation’s stu-
dents and teachers of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

The Scientists Teaching and Reaching Students (STARS) education initiative was
launched  in  FY  2004  to  promote  science  literacy  and  help  develop  the  next  genera-
tion of scientists and engineers. In support of this effort, additional FY 2006 funding
is  requested  for  both  the  Laboratory  Science  Teacher  Professional  Development
(LSTPD)  activity  and  the  Middle  School  Science  Bowl.  The  LSTPD  activity  is  a
three-year  commitment  experience  for  K–14  teachers  and  faculty.  The  LSTPD  will

35

run  at  five  or  more  DOE  national  laboratories  with  about  105  participating  STEM
teachers, in response to the national need for science teachers who have strong con-
tent knowledge in the classes they teach.

The Faculty Sabbatical activity, which is being initiated in FY 2005 for 12 faculty
members from Minority Serving Institutions (MSI), will have five positions available
in  FY  2006.  The  Faculty  Sabbatical  is  aimed  at  providing  sabbatical  opportunities
to  faculty  members  from  MSIs  to  facilitate  the  entry  of  their  faculty  into  the  re-
search  funding  mainstream.  This  activity  is  an  extension  of  the  successful  Faculty
and  Student  Teams  (FaST)  program  where  teams  consisting  of  a  faculty  member
and two or three undergraduate students from colleges and universities with limited
prior  research  capabilities  work  with  mentor  scientists  at  a  national  laboratory  on
a research project that is formally documented in a paper or presentation.

In  the  FY  2006  request,  the  Pre-Service  Teachers  (PST)  activity  will  be  run  at
one national laboratory, as opposed to twelve national laboratories in FY 2005, and
students  will  be  recruited  from  participating  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)
programs.
SAFEGUARDS AND SECURITY
FY 2005 Comparable Appropriation—$67.2 Million; FY 2006 Request—$68.7 Million
The Safeguards and Security (S&S) program ensures appropriate levels of protec-
tion  against  unauthorized  access,  theft,  diversion,  loss  of  custody,  or  destruction  of
DOE  assets  and  hostile  acts  that  may  cause  adverse  impacts  on  fundamental
science, national security or the health and safety of DOE and contractor employees,
the  public  or  the  environment.  The  SC’s  Integrated  Safeguards  and  Security  Man-
agement  strategy  encompasses  a  tailored  approach  to  safeguards  and  security.  As
such, each site has a specific protection program that is analyzed and defined in its
individual  Security  Plan.  This  approach  allows  each  site  to  design  varying  degrees
of protection commensurate with the risks and consequences described in their site-
specific threat scenarios.

The FY 2006 request meets minimum, essential security requirements. Protection
of  employees  and  visitors  is  of  primary  concern,  as  well  as  protection  of  special  nu-
clear  material  and  research  facilities,  equipment  and  data.  Priority  attention  is
given to protective forces, physical security systems, and cyber security.
CONCLUSION

The Office of Science occupies a unique and critical role within the U.S. scientific
enterprise.  We  fund  research  projects  in  key  areas  of  science  that  our  nation  de-
pends  upon.  We  construct  and  operate  major  scientific  user  facilities  that  scientists
from  virtually  every  discipline  are  using  on  a  daily  basis,  and  we  manage  civilian
national laboratories that are home to some of the best scientific minds in the world.
Madame  Chairman,  we  have  made  some  difficult  decisions  this  year  within  the
President’s  budget  request  for  the  Office  of  Science—consistent  with  our  research
priorities—which will allow us to build on the solid foundation created over the last
four years, propel us into new areas of great scientific promise, and maintain Amer-
ica’s world-class stature in science.

I want to thank you, Madame Chairman, for providing this opportunity to discuss
the  Office  of  Science  research  programs  and  our  contributions  to  the  Nation’s  sci-
entific  enterprise.  On  behalf  of  DOE,  I  am  pleased  to  present  this  FY  2006  budget
request for the Office of Science.

This  concludes  my  testimony.  I  would  be  pleased  to  answer  any  questions  you

might have.

from  the  smallest  to  one  of  the  most  rapidly  growing  campuses  in  the  UC  system.
Enrollment  increased  from  8,805  to  more  than  14,400  students  with  corresponding
growth in faculty and new teaching, research, and office facilities.

In  addition  to  his  administrative  duties  at  UC–Riverside,  Dr.  Orbach  maintained
a strong commitment to teaching. He sustained an active research program; worked
with  postdoctoral,  graduate,  and  undergraduate  students  in  his  laboratory;  and

STATEMENT OF MR. DOUGLAS L. FAULKNER, PRINCIPAL DEP-
UTY  ASSISTANT  SECRETARY  FOR  ENERGY  EFFICIENCY  AND
RENEWABLE  ENERGY,  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  ENERGY,
WASHINGTON, DC
Mr. FAULKNER. Thank you, ma’am.
Madame Chairman, Ranking Member, as my entire statement is

part of the record, I will briefly summarize.

The President’s budget includes $1.2 billion for my office, the Of-
fice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and I am pleased
to outline our priorities for the funding.

Our top priority is to reduce America’s dependence on foreign oil.
Since the majority of oil we consume is used to fuel transportation,
we are seeking increases in both our vehicle technologies programs
and our hydrogen and fuel cell programs, proposing to spend nearly
$349  million  in  these  areas.  Our  work,  conducted  in  partnership
with  auto  makers  and  energy  providers,  among  others,  includes
gasoline-electric  hybrid  vehicles,  propulsion,  new  generations  of
spark  and  compression  ignition  internal  combustion  engines,  vehi-
cle  systems,  lightweight  materials,  and  of  course,  hydrogen  fuel
cells  and  the  elements  of  hydrogen  refueling  infrastructure  to  sup-
port them.

Our next priority is to reduce the burden of energy prices on the
disadvantaged.  To  this  end,  we  are  proposing  $230  million  for  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:35 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 020735 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\042705\20735 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

37

low-income  weatherization  program,  an  increase  over  last  year’s
appropriated levels.

Another  priority  of  my  office  is  to  increase  the  viability  and  de-
ployment  of  renewable  energy  technologies.  To  this  end,  we  are
seeking  approximately  $260  million.  This  funding  includes  our
work on solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydropower, and the fa-
cilities and activities needed to support these programs.

Our next priority is to increase the energy efficiency of buildings
and appliances. To this end, we are seeking more than $75 million
for  our  building  technology  program,  ENERGY  STAR,  Rebuild
America, and building code training and assistance activities.

Our  fifth  priority  is  to  spur  the  creation  of  the  domestic  bio-
industry, which we also addressed in previous priorities. In pursuit
of  this  priority,  we  are  seeking  over  $72  million  for  our  biomass
technologies  program.  Our  work  in  this  area  includes  lowering  the
cost  of  sugars  derived  from  discarded  or  under-utilized  cellulosic
materials  from  which  ethanol  and  other  chemicals  or  products
could be made.

Our  sixth  priority  is  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  performance
of  distributed  power  generation,  which  can  enhance  the  reliability
of  the  entire  electricity  grid.  We  propose  to  spend  nearly  $57  mil-
lion on our distributed energy program. That includes work on ad-
vanced  reciprocating  engines,  microturbines,  thermally-activated
technologies, and the packing and integration of these technologies
into compact, affordable systems.

Our seventh priority is to increase the energy efficiency of indus-
try. And to that end, we are seeking $56.5 million for our industry
and  technologies  program.  Technologies  we  are  working  on  are  as
varied  as  continuous-melt  electric  arc  furnaces,  cookless  iron-mak-
ing,  and  high-pressure  superboilers.  We  are  also  continuing  efforts
to communicate best energy efficiency practices among a wide vari-
ety of industrial partners.

Our  eighth  priority  is  to  assist  the  largest  single  energy  user  in
the U.S. economy: the Federal Government. We want them to lead
by  example  on  using  energy  more  efficiently  and  procuring  more
energy  from  renewable  resources.  In  pursuit  of  this  goal,  we  oper-
ate  FEMP,  the  Federal  Energy  Management  Program  and  our  De-
partmental  Energy  Management  Program  with  over  $19  million  of
funding.

Madame  Chairman,  this  is  an  extremely  diverse  portfolio  of  ac-
tivities,  and  sometimes  they  are  challenging  to  manage.  This  is
why  our  ninth  priority  has  been  to  change  and  continuously  im-
prove the way we do business. The National Academy of Public Ad-
ministration, in a study it released a few years ago, five years ago,
in  the  last  Administration,  found  that  the  Office  of  Energy  Effi-
ciency  and  Renewable  Energy,  suffered  from  fragmentation  man-
agement flaws, including emphasis on process over product, lack of
staff  motivation,  lack  of  commitment  to  organizational  goals,  poor
communications,  which  is  usually  due  to  uncoordinated  and  poorly
designed  information  support  systems  and  weak  decision-making
processes.

Following  the  complete  reorganization  of  our  office  in  July  of
2002,  the  Academy  went  in  and  evaluated  our  office  again.  After
an  18-month  study,  the  Academy  found  that  my  office  had

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:35 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 020735 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\042705\20735 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

38

strengthened program management and executed a sound business
model. In the words of the Academy, ‘‘EERE has demonstrated that
much  can  be  achieved  in  a  relatively  short  period  if  top  manage-
ment  is  committed  to  doing  so.  The  leadership  of  DOE  should  ex-
amine  what  this  office  has  accomplished  and  consider  whether  a
similar approach would benefit other parts of the Department.’’

While there is still a great deal yet to do to improve our perform-
ance,  we  are  embracing  the  thoughtful  guiding  principles  that  this
subcommittee has stressed. Among them: greater competition, five-
year  planning,  improved  program  management  while  continuing
ahead  with  the  refinement  and  implementation  of  an  innovative
business model.

With  that,  Madame  Chairman,  I  would  be  pleased  to  take  any

questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Faulkner follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF DOUGLAS L. FAULKNER

Madam  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I  appreciate  the  oppor-
tunity  to  testify  on  the  President’s  Fiscal  Year  2006  Budget  Request  for  the  Office
of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  (EERE).  My  focus  today  will  be  on  the
energy conservation, renewable energy, and hydrogen activities within our research
and development programs.

The  President’s  FY  2006  Budget  includes  $1.2  billion  for  EERE.  In  his  February
2nd  State  of  the  Union  Address,  the  President  underscored  the  need  to  restrain
spending  in  order  to  sustain  our  economic  prosperity.  As  part  of  this  restraint,  it
is important that total discretionary and non-security spending be held to levels pro-
posed  in  the  FY  2006  Budget.  The  budget  savings  and  reforms  in  the  Budget  are
important components of achieving the President’s goal of cutting the budget deficit
in  half  by  2009  and  we  urge  the  Congress  to  support  these  reforms.  The  FY  2006
Budget  includes  more  than  150  reductions,  reforms,  and  terminations  in  non-de-
fense  discretionary  programs,  of  which  one  affects  EERE’s  programs.  The  Depart-
ment wants to work with the Congress to achieve these savings.

The  programs  funded  by  this  appropriation  continue  support  for  certain  Presi-
dential  initiatives;  build  on  research,  development,  and  deployment  successes  al-
ready  achieved;  and  focus  on  implementing  results-oriented  business  practices  to
help achieve strategic energy goals and fulfill the Department’s mission.

EERE has made good on its strategic goal of ‘‘changing the way it does business.’’
Last fall, the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) completed an 18-
month review of EERE’s reorganized structure and noted in its final report, Reorga-
nizing  for  Results,  that  ‘‘the  basic  construct  of  the  reorganization—eliminating  the
sector  organizations  and  restructuring  around  the  major  programs,  and  consoli-
dating the business administration functions-was sound,’’ and that ‘‘EERE has made
great  strides  to  reinvent  how  it  does  business.’’  Our  innovative  business  and  man-
agement model is enabling EERE to fund the right mix of research and development
(R&D) and to get more technical work done effectively with the R&D dollars appro-
priated.  EERE  is  also  guided  by  the  research  and  development  investment  criteria
(RDIC)  called  for  in  the  President’s  Management  Agenda,  as  well  as  the  Office  of
Management and Budget’s (OMB) Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) to guide
its decisions and focus its R&D on long-term, high-payoff activities that require fed-
eral involvement to be successful.

A  primary  long-term  goal  for  our  nation  must  be  to  significantly  reduce  our  de-
pendence  on  foreign  oil,  and  to  develop  the  technologies  that  enable  Americans  to
make  greater  use  of  our  abundant,  clean,  domestic  renewable  energy  resources.
EERE’s FY 2006 request continues support for the President’s Hydrogen Fuel Initia-
tive  to  ensure  that  hydrogen  production,  storage,  and  infrastructure  technologies
will be available and affordable when hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles are ready
for  commercialization.  EERE  also  continues  support  for  its  FreedomCAR  program
(where CAR stands for Cooperative Automotive Research), working with industry to
improve  the  efficiency  and  lower  the  cost  of  advanced  combustion  engines  and  hy-
brid  vehicle  technologies.  In  addition,  EERE  will  pursue  critical  technical  improve-
ments  to  biorefineries  and  the  processes  that  use  biomass,  the  only  renewable  re-
source that can directly produce liquid transportation fuels such as ethanol.

But long-term results are only part of the story for EERE’s programs. The Fiscal
Year  2006  Budget  Request  is  designed  to  provide  results  to  the  American  people
today  by  advancing  technologies  that  are  making  their  way  into  energy-related
products  and  services  that  are  an  integral  part  of  America’s  energy  economy.  Since
2001, research sponsored by EERE has won 37 R&D 100 awards, ten in 2004 alone.
One  technology  winner  this  year  is  the  world’s  first  portable,  flexible  photovoltaic
(PV) power module made from thin-film copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). The
U.S.  Army  is  already  using  these  lightweight  PV  systems  that  can  be  folded  as
small  as  a  9  by  12  envelope,  stowed  in  a  small  backpack,  and  easily  carried  over
long distances to supply efficient and reliable power.

Targeting  all  sectors  of  energy  use,  EERE’s  Fiscal  Year  2006  activities  are  de-
signed  to  make  a  difference  in  the  everyday  lives  of  Americans  today,  and  an  even
greater difference in years to come.
ENERGY  CONSERVATION  AND  RENEWABLE  ENERGY  PROGRAMS  FIS-

CAL YEAR 2006 REQUEST

EERE  programs  funded  by  the  Energy  and  Water  Development  appropriation  in-
clude  Hydrogen  and  Fuel  Cell  Technologies,  Vehicle  Technologies,  Solar  Energy
Technologies,  Wind  and  Hydropower  Technologies,  Geothermal  Technologies,  Bio-
mass  and  Biorefinery  Systems,  Weatherization  and  Intergovernmental,  Distributed
Energy  Resources,  Building  Technologies,  Industrial  Technologies,  Federal  Energy
Management, and Program Management and Direction.
HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGIES

The  Fiscal  Year  2006  Budget  Request  for  Hydrogen  and  Fuel  Cell  Technologies
totals  $182.7  million:  $99.1  million  for  hydrogen  activities,  a  $5.1  million  increase
over  the  Fiscal  Year  2005  comparable  appropriation,  and  $83.6  million  for  fuel  cell
activities, an $8.7 million increase. Hydrogen and fuel cell technologies are the foun-
dation  of  the  President’s  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative  and  help  support  the  Depart-
ment’s  FreedomCAR  program.  Under  the  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Partnership,  gov-
ernment  and  industry  are  working  together  on  research  activities  to  overcome  key
technical  barriers  to  commercialization  of  advanced  efficient  vehicles,  and  to  facili-
tate  a  fuel  cell  hybrid  vehicle  and  hydrogen  infrastructure  commercialization  deci-
sion  by  industry  in  the  year  2015.  Because  hydrogen  fuel  cell  vehicles  emit  no  cri-
teria pollutants or carbon dioxide, their development and commercial success would
essentially  remove  light-duty  transportation  as  an  environmental  issue.  The  hydro-
gen will be produced from diverse domestic resources, making our nation self-reliant
for our personal transportation energy needs.

Much  of  the  proposed  increase  in  Hydrogen  Technology  is  to  accelerate  and  ex-
pand  research  and  development  of  advanced  technologies  for  producing  hydrogen
using  renewable  feedstocks  such  as  biomass  and  renewable  energy  sources  such  as
wind  and  solar.  The  program  is  also  developing  technologies  for  distributed  hydro-
gen production from reforming of natural gas and from electrolysis. Other priorities
include  development  of  on-board  vehicular  hydrogen  storage  systems  to  achieve  a
driving range of greater than 300 miles and development of hydrogen delivery tech-
nologies. The ultimate goal is to reduce the cost of producing, storing, and delivering
hydrogen to a cost competitive with that of gasoline.

Validation  of  fuel  cell  vehicle  and  hydrogen  infrastructure  technologies  under
‘real-world ’ operating conditions is essential to track progress and to help guide re-
search  priorities.  This  year’s  request  contains  $24  million  for  fuel  cell  technology
validation which is a 35 percent increase over the Fiscal Year 2005 comparable ap-
propriation. We are also requesting $14.9 million in funding for the validation of hy-
drogen  infrastructure  technology,  a  58  percent  increase  over  the  Fiscal  Year  2005
comparable appropriation. Automotive and energy partners are matching public dol-
lars on a ‘‘50–50’’ cost-shared basis, and the Department is beginning to receive es-
sential  statistical  data  on  the  status  of  fuel  cell  vehicle  and  infrastructure  tech-
nologies  relative  to  targets  in  the  areas  of  efficiency,  durability,  storage  system
range, and fuel cost. By measuring progress under real-world driving conditions, the
Department  can  accurately  monitor  success  in  overcoming  remaining  fuel  cell  and
infrastructure  technology  barriers  and  assess  progress  towards  the  2015  commer-
cialization  decision  by  industry.  These  activities  also  provide  technical  information
and analysis to support the development of codes and standards for the commercial
use of hydrogen, and feedback on vehicle and infrastructure safety. Fiscal Year 2006
activities  include  opening  eight  hydrogen  fueling  stations,  assessing  performance
and  cost  of  hydrogen  production  and  delivery  technologies,  and  validating  1,000
hours of fuel cell vehicle durability ‘‘on the road.’’ By 2009, the program is expected
to  validate  fuel  cell  vehicle  durability  of  2,000  hours,  a  250-mile  vehicle  range,  and
hydrogen production cost of less than $3.00/gge (gasoline gallon equivalent).

As  highlighted  by  Secretary  Bodman  in  earlier  Congressional  testimony,  I  am
pleased  to  report  that  our  fuel  cell  activities  achieved  an  important  technology  cost
goal this past year when they reduced the high-volume cost of automotive fuel cells
from  $275  per  kilowatt  in  2002  to  $200  per  kilowatt  in  2004.  This  accomplishment
is a major step toward the program’s goal of reducing the cost of transportation fuel
cell  power  systems  to  $45  per  kilowatt  by  2010.1 Research  successes  like  this  will
enable  a  positive  commercialization  decision  in  2015  that  could  lead  to  the  market
introduction of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2020.

The  President’s  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative  was  received  by  Congress  with  enthu-
siasm,  and  we  appreciate  this  subcommittee’s  support.  However,  while  the  EERE
Fiscal Year 2005 comparable appropriation for hydrogen technology was $94 million,
40  percent  of  those  funds  were  earmarked  for  specific  projects  that  are  not  wholly
consistent with our research plan or the recommendations of the National Research
Council. As a consequence, we must delay some very important work in areas such
as  hydrogen  production  and  storage,  and  our  ability  to  meet  our  established  re-
search  targets  in  the  specified  timeframes  may  be  in  jeopardy.  The  Department
looks  forward  to  working  with  Congress  to  help  ensure  that  the  projects  supported
are consistent with our established goals in an effort to keep our progress on track.
VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES

The FreedomCAR & Vehicle Technologies Program focuses on the development of
more  energy  efficient  and  environmentally  friendly  technologies  for  cars  and  trucks
that  will  use  significantly  less  oil,  and  still  preserve  America’s  freedom  of  mobility.
Many of these technologies also serve as the foundation of tomorrow’s hydrogen fuel
cell vehicles.

The  Fiscal  Year  2006  Budget  Request  for  Vehicle  Technologies  is  $165.9  million,
a  $0.5  million  increase  over  the  Fiscal  Year  2005  comparable  appropriation.  Activi-
ties  in  this  program  contribute  to  two  Departmental  initiatives:  the  FreedomCAR
initiative and the 21st Century Truck initiative.

FreedomCAR activities in Fiscal Year 2006 focus on innovative, high-efficiency ve-
hicle  technologies  including  advanced  combustion  engines,  advanced  fuel  formula-
tions,  hybrid  vehicle  systems,  high-powered  batteries,  lightweight  materials,  and
power electronics. These critical technologies can lead to near-term oil savings when
used  with  advanced  combustion  hybrid  electric  vehicles  and  support  the  future  de-
velopment of hydrogen fuel cell hybrid vehicles.

FreedomCAR  goals  include  increasing  passenger  and  light-duty  vehicle  combus-
tion  engine  efficiency  from  30  percent  to  45  percent  by  2010  (while  meeting  2010
EPA emissions standards), and reducing the cost of high-power batteries for hybrid
vehicles  from  $3000  (1998  baseline)  to  $500  for  a  25kW  battery  by  2010.  Combus-
tion  engine  efficiency  is  making  good  progress,  and  in  Fiscal  Year  2006  we  expect
to reach 41 percent efficiency, a major step towards the 2010 goal of 45 percent. Bat-
tery  technologies  have  also  made  significant  progress  toward  these  goals:  the  pro-
gram  reached  its  $1,000  cost  target  for  Fiscal  Year  2004,  and  the  Fiscal  Year  2006
budget is expected to bring that down to $750.

The 21st Century Truck initiative has similar objectives but is focused on commer-
cial  vehicles.  The  2006  request  will  fund  cooperative  research  efforts  between  the
commercial heavy-duty vehicle (trucks and buses) industry and major federal agen-
cies  to  develop  technologies  that  will  make  our  nation’s  commercial  vehicles  more
efficient,  cleaner,  and  safer.  The  effort  centers  on  R&D  to  improve  engine  systems,
heavy-duty  hybrids,  truck  safety,  and  to  reduce  parasitic  losses  (e.g.,  aerodynamic
drag as the vehicle moves down the road at 60 mph, and the power drain from belt
driven accessories like power steering and air conditioning) and engine idling.

In  Fiscal  Year  2004,  the  heavy-duty  vehicle  activity  demonstrated  a  reduction  of
parasitic  losses  from  39  percent  baseline  to  27  percent  in  a  laboratory  setting,  and
activities included in the Fiscal Year 2006 budget are expected to bring those losses
down to 24 percent. The program also demonstrated an increase in heavy-duty die-
sel  engine  efficiency  from  the  baseline  of  40  percent  to  45  percent  in  Fiscal  Year
2004  (while  meeting  EPA  2007  emission  standards)  and  we  expect  the  Fiscal  Year
2006  budget  to  raise  that  to  50  percent  (while  meeting  EPA  2010  emission  stand-
ards)—important steps toward meeting our long-term goal of 55 percent energy effi-
ciency in 2013.
SOLAR ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES

The  Solar  Energy  Technologies  Program  focuses  research  on  advanced  solar  de-
vices  that  can  bring  reliable  and  affordable  solar  energy  technologies  into  the  mar-

1 Cost of 50 kW vehicle fuel cell power systems estimated for production rate of 500,000 units

per year.

ketplace,  helping  our  nation  meet  electricity  needs  and  reducing  the  stress  on  our
critical electricity infrastructure. The Department’s efforts are directed in the inter-
related  areas  of  photovoltaics,  concentrating  solar  power  (CSP),  and  solar  heating
and lighting. The Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Request for solar technology is $84.0 mil-
lion,  which  is  roughly  equivalent  to  the  Fiscal  Year  2005  comparable  appropriation
of $85.1 million.

The  Department’s  photovoltaic  research  and  development  is  focused  on  next-gen-
eration  technologies  such  as  thin-film  photovoltaic  cells  and  leap-frog  technologies
such as polymers and nanostructures. The Fiscal Year 2006 request of $75.0 million
for  photovoltaic  energy  systems  includes  $31.4  million  for  critical  laboratory  re-
search, $28.6 million for advanced materials and devices, and $15.0 million for tech-
nology  development  efforts  to  improve  reliability  of  the  entire  system.  The  Depart-
ment  has  included  $4.5  million  in  the  Fiscal  Year  2006  request  to  support  the  new
Collaborative  Crystalline  Silicon  Photovoltaic  Initiative  designed  to  strengthen
through  research  and  development  the  technological  competitiveness  of  U.S.  prod-
ucts in a rapidly growing world market.

The $6.0 million request for concentrating solar power research includes funds to
accelerate  the  development  of  next-generation  parabolic  trough  concentrators  and
receivers.  Development  of  advanced  thermal  energy  storage  technologies  will  con-
tinue  and  field  validation  will  be  conducted  on  new  collector  technology  being  de-
ployed  in  trough  projects  in  Arizona  and  Nevada.  For  distributed  applications,  re-
search  in  Fiscal  Year  2006  will  focus  on  improving  the  reliability  of  dish  systems
through  the  operation  and  testing  of  multiple  units  at  Sandia  National  Laboratory.
Technical support will also be provided to the Western Governors’ Association to as-
sist their CSP deployment activities.
WIND AND HYDROPOWER TECHNOLOGIES

Wind Energy research and development promotes greater use of the Nation’s fast-
est  growing  energy  resource.  Since  2000,  installed  wind  turbine  capacity  in  the
United States has more than doubled, driven in large part by the tremendous reduc-
tions  in  cost  that  have  resulted  from  wind  energy  research.  Our  research  contrib-
uted  to  reducing  the  cost  of  electricity  generation  by  a  factor  of  20  since  1982,  to
four cents or less per kilowatt-hour in areas with excellent wind resources.

The Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Request for Wind Energy is $44.2 million, $3.4 mil-
lion  more  than  the  Fiscal  Year  2005  comparable  appropriation.  Most  of  the  Fiscal
Year  2006  request  is  to  fund  R&D  on  multiple  large  wind  system  technology  path-
ways in lower wind speed areas to achieve the goal of three cents per kilowatt-hour
for  onshore  systems  and  five  cents  per  kilowatt-hour  for  off-shore  systems  by  2012.
Working in collaborative partnerships with industry, the Department plans to com-
plete  field  testing  of  the  first  full-scale  Low  Wind  Speed  Technology  prototype  tur-
bine  in  Fiscal  Year  2006,  and  begin  fabrication  of  a  second  prototype  turbine  (both
2.5  MW  scale)  which  will  enable  electricity  to  be  generated  closer  to  where  people
live.

Hydropower is the most widely used form of renewable energy in the world today,
accounting for over seven percent of total electricity generation in the United States
and  over  75  percent  of  domestic  renewable  electricity  generation.  The  Department
has  supported  the  development  of  new  turbine  technology  that  reduces  fish  mor-
tality associated with hydropower plant operation. With the completion of testing on
new  turbine  technologies,  and  consistent  with  previous  Congressional  direction,  the
Department plans to close out the Hydropower Program and transfer remaining pro-
gram activities and information to the private sector.

The Fiscal Year 2006 hydropower request of $0.5 million will be used to complete
the monitoring of plant operation and maintenance, and document previous program
activities. Outstanding contracts will be closed out in Fiscal Year 2006.
GEOTHERMAL TECHNOLOGY

The  Geothermal  Technologies  Program  works  in  partnership  with  industry  to  es-
tablish geothermal energy as an economically competitive contributor to the U.S. en-
ergy supply.

Currently  a  $1.3  billion  a  year  industry,  geothermal  energy  production  generates
electricity  or  provides  heat  for  applications  such  as  aquaculture,  crop  drying,  and
district  heating,  or  for  use  in  heat  pumps  to  heat  and  cool  buildings  without  the
emission of greenhouse gases. The Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Request for Geothermal
Technologies  is  $23.3  million,  a  $2.0  million  decrease  from  the  Fiscal  Year  2005
comparable appropriation. The Fiscal Year 2005 appropriation included $3.6 million
in funds for congressionally-directed activities now completed.

In  Fiscal  Year  2006,  the  program  will  conduct  extensive  field  tests  of  exploration
technologies  such  as  remote  sensing  techniques  to  increase  the  U.S.  geothermal  re-

source  base,  and  expand  and  accelerate  the  geothermal  resource  assessments  con-
ducted  in  collaboration  with  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey.  The  program  will  continue
its  Enhanced  Geothermal  Systems  (EGS)  technology  research  to  increase  the  pro-
ductivity and lifetime of engineered reservoirs. The Department estimates that EGS
technology  could  quadruple  the  amount  of  economically  and  technically  viable  geo-
thermal resources in the West and open up new geothermal possibilities throughout
the U.S.
BIOMASS AND BIOREFINERY SYSTEMS R&D

EERE’s  Biomass  Program  focuses  on  advanced  technologies  to  transform  the  Na-
tion’s  domestic  biomass  resources  into  high  value  fuels,  chemicals,  materials,  and
power.  Working  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA),  the  program
leads a multi-agency initiative that coordinates and accelerates all federal bioenergy
R&D in accordance with the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000.

In Fiscal Year 2006, the Department is requesting $72.2 million for Biomass Pro-
gram activities, $15.9 million less than the Fiscal Year 2005 comparable appropria-
tion. Last year’s appropriation, however, included $35.3 million in funds for congres-
sionally-directed  activities  for  which  the  Department  is  not  requesting  additional
funds.

The  Department  requests  $43.4  million  to  support  platforms  R&D.  The  $15  mil-
lion request for Thermochemical Platform R&D will focus on developing technologies
for  the  production,  cleanup,  and  conditioning  of  biomass  syngas  and  pyrolysis  oils
suitable  for  conversion  to  fuels  and  chemicals.  This  will  be  done  in  collaboration
with industrial partners selected under a joint DOE/USDA solicitation issued in Fis-
cal  Year  2004.  The  $28.4  million  requested  for  Bioconversion  Platform  R&D  is  to
work with industry to improve the performance and reduce the costs of enzymes and
biomass pretreatment, resulting in a low cost sugar stream in support of the nearer-
term biorefinery.

The  request  also  includes  $21.8  million  for  cost-shared  R&D  with  U.S.  industry
to  advance  technologies  that  will  convert  this  low  cost  sugar  stream  into  affordable
products (chemicals and materials), furthering the development of efficient biorefin-
eries. Work with industry, universities, and the National Laboratories will focus on
improving  the  efficiency  of  individual  process  steps  such  as  catalysis  and  separa-
tions,  with  a  focus  on  producing  key  building-block  chemicals  that  have  the  poten-
tial to result in a multitude of high-value, renewable chemicals and materials.
WEATHERIZATION AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS2

In  Fiscal  Year  2006,  we  are  requesting  $310.1  million  for  Weatherization  and
Intergovernmental  Activities,  a  $15.7  million  reduction  from  the  Fiscal  Year  2005
comparable appropriation. This includes $230 million for the Weatherization Assist-
ance  Program,  which  will  support  weatherization  of  approximately  92,300  low-in-
come  homes,  saving  the  low-income  homeowner  an  average  of  $274  annually  on
their  energy  bills  at  today’s  prices,  according  to  estimates  by  the  Oak  Ridge  Na-
tional Laboratory.

The Department’s Intergovernmental activities promote rapid deployment of clean
energy  technologies  and  energy  efficient  products.  The  Fiscal  Year  2006  Budget  re-
quests $41.0 million for State Energy Program grants. These grants, and the funds
they  leverage,  allow  State  governments  to  target  their  own  high  priority  energy
needs and expand clean energy choices for their citizens and businesses.

In Fiscal Year 2006, we request $4.0 million for the Tribal Energy Program which
will  enable  the  Department  to  continue  to  build  partnerships  with  Tribal  govern-
ments to assess Native American energy efficiency needs and renewable energy op-
portunities  for  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial  uses.  These  activities  are
helping to complete the foundational work that will encourage private sector invest-
ment in energy projects on Native American lands.
The  Department  includes  an  increase  of  $1.7  million  in  its  Fiscal  Year  2006  re-
quest to expand and support Home Performance with ENERGY STAR, an innova-
tive residential program designed to improve the energy efficiency of existing homes
by up to 30 percent using certified local contractors to perform whole-house retrofits.
State and local pilot projects will be supported at the national level by the dissemi-
nation  of  best  practices,  contractor  training,  program  design  assistance,  and  mar-
keting support.
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES

By  producing  electricity  where  it  is  used,  distributed  energy  technologies  can
strengthen  our  nation’s  aging  electricity  power  infrastructure,  relieve  congestion  on

transmission and distribution systems, and increase supplies during periods of peak
demand.  The  Distributed  Energy  Program  seeks  to  develop  and  deploy  a  diverse
array of integrated distributed generation and thermal energy technologies that are
competitively priced, reliable, and highly efficient. The Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Re-
quest for this program is $56.6 million, a $3.8 million reduction from the Fiscal Year
2005  comparable  appropriation.  This  funding  level  reflects  the  reallocation  of  funds
given  the  advances  made  in  previous  years  and  changes  within  the  overall  energy
research and development portfolio. As in previous years, this year’s request empha-
sizes integrated designs for end-use systems.

Key  performance  target  goals  for  Fiscal  Year  2006  include  the  development  of  a
combined heat and power (CHP) system which operates at over 70 percent efficiency
and a prototype microturbine which can achieve 35 percent efficiency for small-scale
power  generation.  To  help  potential  users  take  better  advantage  of  distributed  en-
ergy opportunities, the program will complete a state regulatory database including
information  on  regulations  such  as  environmental  permitting,  utility  tariffs,  and
interconnection standards, and continue funding the eight Regional Combined Heat
and Power Application Centers across the United States.
BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES

With an annual price tag of over $250 billion, energy use by residential and com-
mercial  buildings  accounts  for  nearly  40  percent  of  the  Nation’s  total  energy  con-
sumption,  including  two-thirds  of  the  electricity  sold  in  the  United  States.  The  $58
million  included  in  this  year’s  request  for  the  Building  Technologies  Program  is  a
decrease  of  $7.5  million  from  the  Fiscal  Year  2005  comparable  appropriation,  pri-
marily  due  to  reductions  in  space  conditioning  and  building  envelope  R&D  that  is
nearing  commercialization.  Fiscal  Year  2006  activities  include  solid  state  lighting,
improved  energy  efficiency  of  other  building  components  and  equipment,  and  their
effective  integration  using  whole-building-system-design  techniques,  and  the  devel-
opment of codes and standards for buildings, appliances, and equipment.

The  $18.3  million  request  for  Residential  Buildings  Integration  aims  to  develop
design packages that enable residential buildings to use 40 to 50 percent less energy
than  current  practice,  and  integrate  renewable  energy  systems  into  highly  efficient
building designs and operations in working toward the ultimate goal in 2020 of net
Zero  Energy  Buildings:  houses  that  produce  as  much  energy  as  they  use  on  an  an-
nual basis.

As  part  of  the  Department’s  focus  on  longer-term,  high-risk  activities  with  great
potential  for  public  benefit,  in  Fiscal  Year  2006  we  are  requesting  $11  million  for
solid  state  lighting  research.  Solid  state  lighting  holds  the  potential  to  more  than
double  the  efficiency  of  general  lighting  systems,  revolutionizing  the  energy  effi-
ciency, appearance, visual comfort, and quality of lighting products.

The  Fiscal  Year  2006  request  also  reflects  the  Department’s  continued  commit-
ment  to  advancing  buildings  codes  and  appliance  standards.  Because  key  analyses
and  peer  reviews  for  several  priority  appliance  rule-makings  will  be  completed  in
Fiscal Year 2005, funding requirements for Fiscal Year 2006 will be reduced in this
area.
FEDERAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) and the Departmental Energy
Management  Program  (DEMP)  assist  federal  agencies  and  the  Department  in  in-
creasing  their  use  of  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  technologies  through
alternative financing contract support, technical assistance, and funding for retrofit
projects. By using existing energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies and
techniques, the Federal Government can set an example and lead the Nation toward
becoming a cleaner, more efficient energy consumer.

FEMP’s  Fiscal  Year  2006  request  is  $19.2  million,  a  $0.7  million  reduction  from
the  Fiscal  Year  2005  comparable  appropriation.  We  are  requesting  $6.8  million  for
FEMP  technical  support  that  promotes  agency  use  of  alternative  financing  tools,
which  allow  federal  agencies  to  access  private  sector  financing  to  fund  energy  im-
provements through Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) and Utility En-
ergy  Service  Contracts  (UESC)  at  no  net  cost  to  taxpayers.  In  addition,  we  are  re-
questing  $7.7  million  for  Technical  Guidance  and  Assistance  activities  to  help  fed-
eral energy managers identify, design, and implement new construction and facility
improvement projects that incorporate energy efficiency and renewable energy.
INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES

The  Industrial  Technologies  Program  seeks  to  reduce  the  energy  intensity  of  the
U.S.  industrial  sector  through  a  coordinated  program  of  R&D,  validation,  and  dis-
semination  of  energy-efficiency  technologies  and  operating  practices.  The  Depart-

44

ment  is  working  to  achieve  the  program’s  goals  by  partnering  with  domestic  indus-
try, its equipment manufacturers, and its many stakeholders.

The  Fiscal  Year  2006  Budget  Request  is  $56.5  million,  an  $18.3  reduction  from
the  Fiscal  Year  2005  comparable  appropriation.  We  strongly  believe  that  this  level
of  funding  is  sufficient  because  the  Industrial  Technologies  Program  is  becoming
more  focused  and  more  strategic  in  its  investments  in  next-generation  industrial
technologies.  The  Program’s  strategic  approach  is  based  on  developing  a  focused,
multi-year  plan  that  is  designed  to  identify  a  limited  number  of  high-priority,  en-
ergy-saving research and development opportunities, characterize the technical bar-
riers associated with each of those opportunities, and implement a multi-year devel-
opment  pathway  to  achieve  success  in  each  identified  focus  area.  Many  of  these
R&D efforts will be in exploratory phases in Fiscal Year 2006 as the program identi-
fies  the  most  promising  technology  areas  and  adopts  a  balanced  portfolio  of  high-
risk, high-return R&D.
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTION

The Program Management (Energy Conservation) and Program Direction (Energy
Supply)  budgets  provide  resources  for  executive  and  technical  direction  and  over-
sight required for the implementation of EERE programs. The Budget Request cov-
ers federal staff as well as the equipment, supplies, materials, information systems,
technology equipment, and travel required to support management and oversight of
programs.  Also  funded  by  this  request  are  properties;  public  information  activities;
support  service  contractors;  and  crosscutting  performance  evaluation,  analysis  and
planning.

The Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Requests for Program Management and Program Di-
rection  total  $108.1  million,  representing  a  $4.0  million  (3.6  percent)  decrease  from
the  Fiscal  Year  2005  comparable  appropriations.  The  decrease  primarily  reflects
completion  of  the  National  Academy  of  Science  review,  the  absence  of  support  for
prior  congressionally-directed  activities,  and  the  movement  of  support  service  fund-
ing for the Climate Change Technology Program out of this request. With these ac-
tivities excluded, our request actually represents an increase of $4.9 million to sup-
port  our  efforts  to  improve  project  management  and  to  more  accurately  report  our
true cost of doing business. We also request $2.9 million within Renewable Program
Support  for  crosscutting  analysis  and  planning,  which  was  formerly  funded  within
individual renewable program budgets.
CONCLUSION

Madam  Chairman,  we  believe  the  Administration’s  Fiscal  Year  2006  Budget  for
energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy,  and  hydrogen  research,  development,  dem-
onstration and deployment programs will contribute to improved energy security by
promoting  a  diverse  supply  of  reliable,  affordable,  and  environmentally  sound  en-
ergy, and by promoting the efficient use of energy.

This completes my prepared statement, and I am happy to answer any questions

the Subcommittee may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR DOUGLAS L. FAULKNER

Douglas Faulkner was appointed by President George W. Bush on June 29, 2001,
to  serve  as  the  political  deputy  in  the  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable
Energy  (EERE).  This  $1.2  billion  research  and  development  organization  has  over
five  hundred  federal  employees  in  Washington,  D.C.  and  six  regional  offices,  sup-
ported  by  thousands  of  contractors  at  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory
and elsewhere.

Mr.  Faulkner  oversees  all  aspects  of  EERE’s  operations  in  a  close  partnership
with  the  Office’s  two  career  Deputy  Assistant  Secretaries.  He  has  worked  closely
with  Assistant  Secretary  David  K.  Garman  to  reorganize  EERE,  replacing  an  out-
dated and fragmented organization with what arguably is the most innovative busi-
ness  model  ever  used  in  the  Federal  Government.  This  has  resulted  in  fewer  man-
agement  layers,  fewer  but  more  productive  staff,  streamlined  procedures,  stronger
project  management  in  the  field  and  lower  operating  costs  overall.  These  reforms
have been recognized as a success by the White House and the National Association
of Public Administration.

Mr. Faulkner organized and led an internal management board which completely
revamped  EERE’s  biomass  programs.  Many  projects  were  ended  and  those  funds
pooled for an unprecedented solicitation to refocus R&D for new bio-refineries.

Interviews of Mr. Faulkner about renewable energy and energy efficiency have ap-

peared on television and radio and in the print media.

Before  assuming  his  leadership  post  in  EERE,  Mr.  Faulkner  had  progressed  rap-
idly  through  the  ranks  of  the  civil  service  at  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency  and
the Department of Energy. In his over twenty-year career he rose from junior China
intelligence  analyst  to  a  nationally-recognized  leader  in  bio-based  products  and  a
senior policy advisor to the Secretaries of Energy in both Bush Administrations.

Born  and  raised  in  central  Illinois,  Principal  Deputy  Faulkner  received  a  Bach-
elor’s  degree  in  Asian  Studies  from  the  University  of  Illinois  and  a  Master’s  degree
from  the  Johns  Hopkins  University,  School  of  Advanced  International  Studies.  He
also attended the University of Singapore as a Rotary Scholar. At these institutions,
he  studied  French  and  Mandarin  Chinese  languages.  Mr.  Faulkner  played  inter-
collegiate basketball at home and abroad.

He  is  involved  in  his  church  and  community  as  well  as  Boy  Scouts  and  youth
baseball.  Mr.  Faulkner  was  appointed  in  the  early  1990s  to  two  Arlington  County,
Virginia, economic commissions.

Mr. Faulkner lives in Arlington, Virginia, with his wife and son.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
I think we will have time for one more statement.
Mr. Maddox. Turn on your microphone.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  MARK  R.  MADDOX,  PRINCIPAL  DEPUTY
ASSISTANT  SECRETARY  FOR  FOSSIL  ENERGY,  THE  DEPART-
MENT OF ENERGY, WASHINGTON, DC
Mr.  MADDOX.  Chairwoman  Biggert,  Members  of  the  Sub-

committee, it is a pleasure to join you today.

You  have  received  my  submitted  testimony,  which  presents  the

Office of Fossil Energy’s fiscal year 2006 request in detail.

I thought it would be useful this morning to survey briefly Fossil
Energy’s programs in order to provide you with a sense of what we
have accomplished, what we are working on now, and what we ex-
pect to accomplish in the future.

Coal is the Nation’s most abundant energy resource, with domes-
tic  reserves  exceeding  the  energy  potential  of  the  world’s  total  oil
reserves. About 90 percent of all coal produced in the United States
is used for electricity generation, and over half of our nation’s elec-
tricity is produced by coal-fired plants.

Since  1970,  the  United  States  has  reduced  sulfur  dioxide  emis-
sions  from  coal  by  40  percent,  nitrogen  oxide  emissions  by  more
than 20 percent, and particulate emissions by 60 percent while tri-
pling coal consumption. Building on this foundation, the Clean Coal
program’s overall goal is to continue to reduce polluting emissions,
including  mercury  and  greenhouse  gas,  to  near  zero  by  the  year
2020. We expect to do this by developing technologies that increase
efficiencies and, therefore, emit fewer pollutants, and by developing
technologies that capture pollutants.

Let  me  highlight  a  few  of  the  programs  that  will  help  us  reach
our  goals  and  fulfill  President  Bush’s  10-year,  $2-billion  commit-
ment to clean coal research.

First,  the  Innovation  for  Existing  Plants  Program,  which  is  de-
signed  to  produce  dramatic  short-term  reductions  in  emissions  of
nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, mercury, and by-
products of combustion from existing plants. The 1970’s federal re-
search  projects  helped  improve  the  ability  of  early  scrubbers  to  re-
move  sulfur  from  exhaust  gases.  The  Energy  Department’s  Clean
Coal  Technology  program  in  the  1980s  demonstrated  lower  costs
and  more  effective  scrubber  technologies.  To  meet  the  more  strin-
gent  and  oxide  standards  in  the  1990  Clean  Air  Act  amendments,
many  power  plants  turned  to  new,  low-nitrogen  oxide  burners  pio-

neered  by  the  Energy  Department’s  Clean  Coal  Technology  pro-
gram.

The Innovations for Existing Plants Program is today completing
tests  of  technologies  that  can  reduce  mercury  by  50  to  70  percent,
nitrogen oxide to less than 0.15 pounds per million BTUs at three-
fourths  the  cost  of  selected  catalytic  reduction,  particulate  matter
by  99.99  percent,  and  acid  gases  by  95  percent.  By  2010,  the  pro-
gram  expects  to  test  technologies  for  advanced  cooling,  90  percent
mercury reduction and a 66 percent increase in byproducts use.

• The  proven  Integrated  Gasification  Combined  Cycle,  or
IGCC,  technology  is  designed  to  deliver  significant  increases
in  operating  efficiency  and  reductions  in  emissions  when
compared  to  conventional  coal-based  plants.  Our  strategy  is
to make IGCC technology more efficient and flexible, cleaner,
and cheaper.
• The  Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative,  or  CCPI,  is  devoted  to  the
rapid  demonstration  of  emerging  technologies  in  coal-based
power  generation  and  the  acceleration  of  commercialization.
To date, CCPI projects include an array of new, cleaner, and
cheaper concepts for reducing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides,
and  mercury,  as  well  as  two  next-generation  IGCC  projects.
CCPI also includes the power plant of the future, FutureGen.
• Carbon sequestration, the capture and permanent storage of
carbon dioxide, has emerged as an extremely promising tech-
nology. The program includes regional partnerships through-
out  the  United  States  and  parts  of  Canada  to  identify  best
locations and appropriate technologies.
• The  Fuels  program  includes  production  of  Hydrogen  from
Coal.  Hydrogen’s  energy  potential  has  become  more  appar-
ent,  not  just  for  transportation,  but  as  a  clean  fuel  for  ad-
vanced  power  technologies,  such  as  fuel  cells  for  stationary
power generation.
• The Fuel Cell R&D program has been refined to focus on the
successful  and  highly  promising  work  of  the  Solid  State  En-
ergy  Conversion  Alliance,  known  as  SECA.  Fuel  cell  tech-
nology  for  stationary  electricity  generation  offers  ultra-low,
high  operating  efficiency  and  near  zero  polluting  and  green-
house gas emissions.
• The  mission  of  the  Natural  Gas  Technology  program  has
been to develop policies and new technologies that stimulate
a  diverse  supply  of  natural  gas,  both  in  North  America  and
around the world. The Oil Technology program’s mission has
been  to  implement  a  policy  and  research  and  development
program  to  resolve  the  environmental  supply  and  reliability
constraints of producing oil resources.

Budget  discipline  necessitated  and  close  scrutiny  of  our  oil  and
natural  gas  technology  programs  using  strict  guidelines  to  deter-
mine their effectiveness and compare them to other programs offer-
ing  more  clearly  demonstrated  and  substantial  benefits.  As  a  re-
sult, the budget proposes to conduct the orderly termination of the
Oil  and  Gas  Technology  program  in  Fiscal  Year  2006,  with  prior
year funds used to support ongoing projects.

Finally,  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve,  an  energy  security
mainstay  of  the  Nation,  continues  to  operate  smoothly  as  we  work
toward filling the reserve to 700 million barrels this year.

Chairman Biggert and Members of the Subcommittee, I look for-

ward to your questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Maddox follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARK R. MADDOX

Chairman  Biggert,  Members  of  the  Committee,  it  is  a  pleasure  to  join  you  today
to present the Office of Fossil Energy’s FY 2006 budget submission. The Department
appreciates  the  support  of  the  Chairman  and  the  Members  of  the  Committee  over
the  past  years  and  looks  forward  to  working  with  you  on  budget  issues  related  to
the Fossil Energy Program.

Before  I  discuss  the  Fossil  Energy  budget  in  detail,  I  would  like  to  say  that  in
his  February  2,  2005  State  of  the  Union  Address,  the  President  underscored  the
need  to  restrain  spending  in  order  to  sustain  our  economic  prosperity.  As  part  of
this  restraint,  it  is  important  that  total  discretionary  and  non-security  spending  be
held to levels proposed in the FY 2006 President’s Budget.

The  budget  savings  and  reforms  in  the  Budget  are  important  components  of
achieving  the  President’s  goal  of  cutting  the  budget  deficit  in  half  by  2009  and  we
urge  the  Congress  to  support  these  reforms.  The  FY  2006  President’s  Budget  in-
cludes  more  than  150  reductions,  reforms,  and  terminations  in  non-defense  discre-
tionary  programs,  of  which  two  program  terminations  are  reflected  in  the  Depart-
ment’s  Fossil  Energy  budget.  Those  program  terminations  are  for  the  Natural  Gas
and Oil Technology programs. The Department wants to work with the Congress to
achieve these savings.
The Office of Fossil Energy

At the core of the Department’s mission are two fundamental objectives: to ensure
America’s  readiness  to  respond  to  short-term  energy  supply  disruptions  and  to  pro-
vide  the  Nation  with  the  best  opportunity  to  tap  the  full  potential  of  its  abundant
fossil fuel resources.

As  the  Nation  strives  to  reduce  its  reliance  on  imported  energy  sources,  DOE  is
leading  the  way  by  seeking  new  energy  technologies  and  methodologies  that  pro-
mote the efficient and environmentally sound use of fossil fuels.

The  United  States  relies  on  fossil  fuels  for  about  85  percent  of  the  energy  it  con-
sumes  and  forecasts  indicate  U.S.  reliance  on  these  fuels  could  exceed  87  percent
by 2025.

Accordingly, a key goal of DOE’s fossil energy activities is to ensure that economic
benefits from fossil fuels are compatible with the public’s expectation for exceptional
environmental  quality  and  reduced  energy  security  risks.  This  includes  promoting
the  development  of  energy  systems  and  practices  that  will  provide  current  and  fu-
ture generations with energy that is clean, efficient, reasonably priced, and reliable.
The Department’s programs focus on supporting the President’s top initiatives for
energy  security,  clean  air,  climate  change,  and  coal  research.  FY  2006  DOE  pro-
grams:

• Support  the  development  of  lower  cost,  more  effective  pollution  control  tech-
nologies  embodied  in  the  President’s  Coal  Research  Initiative  to  meet  the
goals of the President’s Clear Skies Initiative;
• Expand  the  Nation’s  technological  options  for  reducing  greenhouse  gases  ei-
ther by increasing power plant efficiencies or by capturing and isolating these
gases from the atmosphere; and
• Measurably  add  to  our  energy  security  by  providing  a  series  of  solutions  to
the  Nation’s  energy  challenges,  beginning  with  the  short-term  emergency  re-
sponse provided by such programs as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Long-
term responses to the energy security challenge include the production of hy-
drogen from coal to support and hasten development of the ‘‘hydrogen energy
economy.’’

The President’s Coal Research Initiative

Coal  is  our  nation’s  most  abundant  energy  resource,  with  domestic  reserves  al-
most equal to the energy potential of the world’s total oil reserves. About 90 percent
of all coal produced in the United States is used for electricity generation, and over
half of our nation’s electricity is produced by coal-fired power plants.

Meeting  rising  demand  for  clean,  reliable  and  affordable  electricity  will  require
the use of coal for the foreseeable future, which in turn will require the development
of new, environmentally sound technologies for coal-based electricity generation.

The  FY  2006  budget  supports  the  Department’s  continuing  effort  to  fulfill  Presi-
dent  Bush’s  10-year,  $2  billion  commitment  to  clean  coal  research,  beginning  with
funding for the President’s Coal Research Initiative (CRI) of $286 million, a $13 mil-
lion increase over the 2005 enacted level.

In  addition  to  increasing  funding  for  CRI,  the  distribution  of  funds  to  various  re-
search  and  development  components  of  the  program  has  been  modified  to  achieve
the  maximum  program  benefit  in  a  disciplined  budget  environment  through  im-
proved alignment with the Research and Development Investment Criteria.
Clean Coal Power Initiative and FutureGen

Within  the  President’s  Coal  Research  Initiative,  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative
(CCPI)  is  a  key  component  of  the  National  Energy  Policy  to  address  the  reliability
and  affordability  of  the  Nation’s  electricity  supply,  particularly  from  its  coal-based
generation. The FY 2006 budget request includes $68 million for CCPI, $50 million
of  which  is  for  demonstration  projects,  and  $18  million  for  FutureGen,  the  world’s
first near-zero emissions coal-fueled power plant.

The  $50  million  allocated  for  the  cooperative,  cost-shared  CCPI  program  between
government  and  industry  will  be  devoted  to  continuing  the  rapid  demonstration  of
emerging technologies in coal-based power generation, which should accelerate com-
mercialization  by  the  private  sector.  Under  CCPI,  the  Nation’s  power  generators,
equipment manufacturers, and coal producers help identify the most critical barriers
to  coal’s  use  in  the  power  sector.  Technologies  are  selected  with  the  goal  of  accel-
erating development and enhancing the potential for deployment of coal technologies
that will economically meet environmental standards, while increasing the efficiency
and reliability of coal power plants.

There  are  currently  10  active  CCPI  projects,  six  from  the  first  competition,  an-
nounced  in  January  2003,  and  four  from  the  second,  announced  in  October  2004.
The  projects  have  a  total  value  of  $2.7  billion,  $550  million  of  which  is  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy’s  cost  share.  The  projects  include  an  array  of  new  cleaner  and
cheaper  concepts  for  reducing  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxides,  and  mercury—the
three air pollutants targeted by the Clear Skies Initiative.

In FY 2006, the Department will begin developing a solicitation for a third round

of projects.

The  FutureGen  program  for  FY  2006,  backed  up  by  a  request  for  $257  million  to
become  available  in  FY  2007  that  corresponds  to  unexpended  funds  available  from
prior years’ clean coal projects, will establish the capability and feasibility of co-pro-
ducing electricity and hydrogen from coal with essentially zero emissions, including
carbon  sequestration  and  gasification  combined  cycle,  both  integral  components  of
the coal-fueled power plant of the future. FutureGen is important to demonstrating
the future of coal use to meet the Nation’s energy security and environmental chal-
lenges.

The FY 2006 Budget Request also includes $283 million for research and develop-
ment programs in the President’s Coal Research Initiative and Distributed Genera-
tion  Systems,  with  an  emphasis  on  advanced  technologies  that  support  the
FutureGen  vision  of  coal-fueled  generation  of  electricity  and  hydrogen  with  essen-
tially  zero  emissions.  The  programs  will  focus  on  all  the  key  technologies  for
FutureGen:  carbon  sequestration,  membrane  technologies  for  oxygen  and  hydrogen
separation,  advanced  turbines,  fuel  cells,  coal  to  hydrogen  conversion,  gasifier  re-
lated technologies, and other technologies.
Carbon Management

Several Clean Coal projects help to increase the available options for meeting the
President’s climate change goal of an 18 percent reduction in greenhouse gas inten-
sity  (carbon  equivalent  per  GDP)  by  2012,  primarily  by  boosting  the  efficiencies  of
power  plants—the  less  fuel  used  to  generate  electricity,  the  lower  the  emissions  of
greenhouse gases.

Carbon  management  has  become  an  increasingly  important  element  of  our  coal
research program. Carbon sequestration—the capture and permanent storage of car-
bon  dioxide—has  emerged  as  one  of  the  highest  priorities  in  the  Fossil  Energy  re-
search  program—a  priority  reflected  in  the  proposed  budget  of  $67.2  million  in  FY
2006, a nearly 50 percent increase over FY 2005’s $45 million allocation.

One  of  the  cornerstones  of  our  carbon  sequestration  program,  a  national  network
of  regional  partnerships,  will  continue  its  important  work  in  FY  2006.  This  Secre-
tarial  initiative  has  brought  together  the  Federal  Government,  state  agencies,  uni-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:35 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 020735 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ENER05\042705\20735 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

49

versities, and private industry to determine which options for capturing and storing
greenhouse gases are most practicable for specific areas of the country.

In  addition,  the  international,  Ministerial-level  Carbon  Sequestration  Leadership
Forum  will  continue  to  execute  its  mission  of  gathering  data,  exchanging  informa-
tion  and  participating  in  joint  projects  to  advance  carbon  sequestration  technology.
Hydrogen

Another aspect of the President’s Coal Research Initiative is the production of hy-
drogen from coal. Hydrogen production research is important because hydrogen can
serve  as  a  clean  fuel  for  tomorrow’s  advanced  power  technologies  such  as  fuel  cells
for  distributed  generation,  and  for  future  transportation  systems.  Within  the  Fossil
Energy  program,  we  are  requesting  $22  million  in  FY  2006  for  hydrogen-from-coal
research, a 27 percent increase over the FY 2005 appropriation of $17 million.
Innovations for Existing Plants

While  DOE  continues  its  aggressive  Research,  Development  and  Demonstration
projects  for  technologies  of  the  future,  it  is  also  supporting  the  President’s  Clear
Skies  Initiative  with  short-term  advanced  for  current  technology.  Innovations  for
Existing  Plants  is  an  important  program  that  aims  to  achieve  dramatic  reductions
in  emissions  of  mercury,  nitrogen  oxide,  particulate  matter  and  byproducts  of  com-
bustion  from  existing  coal  plants.  We  are  requesting  $24  million  in  FY  2006,  a  25
percent boost over the FY 2005 appropriated level of $19 million.
Gasification Technology (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle)

Advances  to  the  leading  edge  integrated  gasification  combined  cycle  (IGCC)  tech-
nology, which delivers significant increases in operating efficiency and reductions in
emissions  when  compared  to  conventional  coal-fired  power  plants,  will  intensify  in
FY  2006  with  R&D  projects  aimed  at  reducing  capital  costs  and  technical  risk,  in-
creasing  plant  efficiency  and  availability,  and  achieving  essentially  zero  emissions.
We  are  requesting  $56  million  for  Gasification  Technology  in  FY  2006  to  improve
and  test  gasification  designs,  materials,  instrumentation  and  processes.  This  rep-
resents a 23 percent increase over the FY 2005 appropriation of $46 million.
Fuel Cells

Perhaps better known to the public for its potential to power automobiles, fuel cell
technology  also  presents  enormous  potential  to  significantly  improve  environmental
performance and energy security as a source of electrical power in stationary plants
at  or  near  the  end  user.  Fuel  cells  are  highly  adaptable;  they  can  be  sued  as  a
stand-alone  power  source,  integrated  with  other  generators,  or  connected  to  a  cen-
tral power grid.

Fuel  cells  can  reduce  criteria  pollutants  well  below  New  Source  Performance
Standard  levels,  as  well  as  thermal  and  acid  rain  precursor  emissions.  They  offer
important carbon management advantages because of their inherently low emissions
and ultra-high operating efficiency.

In distributed generation systems, fuel cells can help meet peak demand require-
ments  cost-effectively,  and  IGCC  and  FutureGen  systems  with  fuel  cell  modules
have  the  potential  to  significantly  increase  the  efficiency  of  coal-based  systems  and
achieve near-zero emissions.

Finally,  fuel  cells  will  be  a  vital  element  in  the  hydrogen  economy  of  the  future,
using hydrogen from coal to both generate electric power and support the hydrogen
fuel  cell-powered  automotive  fleet  envisioned  in  President  Bush’s  FreedomCAR  and
Hydrogen Fuel initiatives.

Faced  with  these  potential  benefits  the  Department  has  refined  its  ongoing  Fuel
Cell Research and Development program to focus on the successful and highly prom-
ising  work  of  the  Solid  State  Energy  Conversion  Alliance  (SECA).  To  better  align
the  program  with  the  R&D  Investment  Criteria,  all  fuel  cell  funding  for  FY  2006
has  been  redirected  to  SECA  from  previous,  less  promising  or  completed  R&D
projects that ran in parallel with the SECA program.

This decision provides a two-fold budgeting benefit: the overall cost of the fuel cell
program would be reduced by $10 million, to $65 million in FY 2006, while funding
for  the  most  promising  research  avenue,  SECA,  increases  by  nearly  $12  million,  or
20 percent, over the FY 2005 appropriation of $54 million.

In  a  disciplined  bud  get  environment,  DOE  has  fashioned  a  Clean  Coal  program
that  answers  the  short-,  mid-  and  long-term  energy  and  environmental  challenges
of  the  Nation  by  effectively  allocating  resources  to  balance  work  on  today’s  dem-
onstration projects with research and development into tomorrow’s technologies and,
ultimately of FutureGen, the power plant of the future.

Oil and Natural Gas Technology

The  FY  2006  budget  request  includes  $20  million  for  the  cost  of  orderly  termi-
nation of the Oil and Gas technology programs, with prior-year funds to be used for
the purposes appropriated. The decision to terminate these programs reflects a stra-
tegic  assessment  of  the  programs’  technical  effectiveness  compared  to  other  fossil
energy  programs  that  are  more  efficient  and  technically  viable.  This  is  in  line  with
our commitment to deliver results for the American taxpayer. The focus in FY 2006
will  be  to  conduct  the  orderly  termination  of  these  programs  and  I  look  forward  to
achieving this efficiency for the taxpayers. Funding requested in the FY 2006 budget
will be used to fulfill legal obligations incurred in the termination process.
Other Fossil Energy Research and Development Activities

The budget request also includes $120 million for other activities in the Fossil En-
ergy  Research  and  Development  program,  including  $99  million  for  headquarters
and  field  office  program  direction  and  management  support;  $8  million  for  environ-
mental  restoration;  $3  million  for  federal  matching  funds  for  cooperative  research
and development projects; $1.8 million for natural gas import/export responsibilities;
and  $8  million  for  advanced  metallurgical  research  at  the  Albany  Research  Center.
Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)

The  President  has  directed  that  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve  (SPR)  be  filled
to 700 million barrels. The mechanism for doing this is a cooperative effort with the
Minerals  Management  Service  to  transfer  to  SPR  exchange  royalty  oil  from  federal
leases  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  Current  projections  are  that  SPR  will  reach  its  700
million barrel target in mid-2005.

The  FY  2006  budget  request  for  SPR  facilities  development  and  management  is
$166  million,  approximately  equal  to  the  FY  2005  budget  appropriation.  The  SPR
does not require additional funds in the oil acquisition account for transporting ‘‘roy-
alty-in-kind’’ oil to the SPR, since these charges are the responsibility of the oil sup-
plier.  Also,  SPR  has  the  authority  to  ‘‘borrow’’  funds  from  other  Departmental  ac-
counts to support an emergency SPR drawdown.
Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve

FY 2006 activities for the Heating Oil Reserve will be funded with carryover from
prior  years.  The  two  million  barrel  reserve  remains  ready  to  respond  to  a  Presi-
dential  Order  should  there  be  a  severe  fuel  oil  supply  disruption  in  the  Northeast.
Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves

The  FY  2006  Budget  Request  of  $18.5  million  funds  environmental  remediation,
cultural  resource,  and  equity  determination  activities  required  as  a  result  of  the
Naval  Petroleum  Reserve  No.  1  sales  agreement.  Also  included  is  continued  oper-
ation of the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC), the Naval Petroleum
Reserve  No.  3  in  Wyoming,  and  lease  management  activities  at  Naval  Petroleum
Reserve No. 2.
Elk Hills School Lands Fund

The  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  FY  1996  required,  subject  to  appro-
priation,  DOE  to  pay  nine  percent  of  the  net  proceeds  of  the  Elk  Hills  sale  to  the
Teachers Retirement Fund of the State of California with respect to its longstanding
claims to two parcels of land (‘‘school lands’’) within NPR–1. The $84 million budget
for  Elk  Hills  in  FY  2006  reflects  the  advance  appropriation  of  $36  million  included
in the FY 2005 Interior Appropriations Act and additional funds for a seventh pay-
ment. In light of the delays in equity finalization, discussions are ongoing.
Closing

Fossil Energy’s programs are structured to promote the cost-effective development
of  energy  systems  and  practices  that  will  provide  current  and  future  generations
with  energy  that  is  clean,  efficient,  reasonably  priced,  and  reliable.  Our  focus  is  on
supporting  the  President’s  top  initiatives  for  energy  security,  clean  air,  climate
change,  and  coal  research.  By  reevaluating,  refining  and  refocusing  our  programs
and funding the most cost-effective and beneficial projects, the FY 2006 budget sub-
mission meets the Nation’s critical needs for energy, environmental and national se-
curity.

Chairman  Biggert,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  this  completes  my  prepared
statement.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  you  may  have  at  this  time.

BIOGRAPHY FOR MARK R. MADDOX

Mark Maddox currently serves as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the
Office of Fossil Energy. In this position, Mr. Maddox is involved in several high-pri-
ority  Presidential  initiatives  including  implementation  of  the  Administration’s  $2-
billion,  10-year  initiative  to  develop  a  new  generation  of  environmentally  sound
clean  coal  technologies,  the  $1-billion  FutureGen  project  to  develop  a  pollution-free
plant  to  co-produce  electricity  and  hydrogen,  and  the  Nation’s  Strategic  Petroleum
Reserve  and  Northeast  Home  Heating  Oil  Reserve,  both  key  emergency  response
tools  available  to  the  President  to  protect  Americans  from  energy  supply  disrup-
tions.

Prior  to  taking  his  position  in  Fossil  Energy  in  September  2003,  Mr.  Maddox

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  The  Committee  will  be  in  order,  and  we

will move on to our next witness.

Mr. Johnson, you are recognized for five minutes.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  ROBERT  SHANE  JOHNSON,  DEPUTY  DI-
RECTOR  FOR  TECHNOLOGY,  THE  OFFICE  OF  NUCLEAR  EN-
ERGY,  SCIENCE,  AND  TECHNOLOGY,  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF
ENERGY, WASHINGTON, DC
Mr. JOHNSON. Chairman Biggert, Members of the Subcommittee,
it  is  a  pleasure  to  be  here  to  discuss  the  Fiscal  Year  2006  budget
submission for the Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy, Science,
and Technology.

Our  request  details  proposed  programs  totaling  $511  million  to
continue our efforts to develop and deploy advanced nuclear energy
technologies in this country.

I  have  submitted  a  written  statement  for  the  record,  but  would

like to provide a few summary remarks.

In  Fiscal  Year  1998,  the  Nation’s  Nuclear  Energy  Research  pro-
gram had come to a virtual standstill. In that year, federal funding
for Nuclear Energy R&D fell essentially to zero. It was also a year
when the number of students entering the nuclear engineering dis-
cipline  in  this  country  plummeted  from  around  1,500  only  five
years  earlier  to  an  all-time  low  of  about  500.  It  was  a  year  when
the  international  community  began  to  turn  away  from  the  United
States as a source of leadership in nuclear technology development.
Since  that  time,  the  Chair  and  Members  of  this  subcommittee
have  invested  considerable  personal  effort  to  shepherd  a  revival  of
the  Federal  Nuclear  Energy  Research  program.  Similarly,  we  at
the  Department  have  worked  hard  to  refocus  and  re-invent  our  ef-
forts to create a better, stronger program.

I  am  pleased  to  report  that  these  efforts  are  proving  to  be  suc-
cessful.  Nuclear  engineering  education  is  resurgent  in  the  United
States  with  nearly  1,600  students  now  studying  in  the  schools
across  our  country.  The  number  of  students  studying  nuclear
science has such an increase; strong programs at universities, such
as  Ohio  State,  Purdue,  and  Texas  A&M  continue  to  grow;  and  we
see new programs being established in schools, such as South Caro-
lina State University and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

The  Department’s  programs,  aimed  at  enhancing  nuclear  edu-
cation  in  the  United  States,  continue  to  support  this  progress  in
our 2006 budget request. We have reasserted U.S. leadership in the
international  community.  In  February  of  this  year,  Secretary
Bodman  joined  the  ambassadors  and  senior  officials  from  France,
the  United  Kingdom,  Japan,  and  Canada  in  signing  the  world’s
first,  multi-lateral  agreement  for  the  development  of  next-genera-
tion nuclear energy technologies. As this Generation IV agreement
and other actions demonstrate, the United States is once again set-
ting the pace for international cooperation and partnership.

The Generation IV technologies emerging from this work will not
only be safe, economic, and secure, but will also include energy con-
version systems that produce valuable commodities, such as hydro-
gen,  fresh  water,  and  process  heat.  These  features  make  the  Gen-
eration IV reactors ideal for meeting the President’s energy and en-
vironmental objectives.

At the same time, our partners in industry have worked hard to
improve  the  picture  on  their  side.  When  it  appeared  that  nuclear
power’s  era  had  ended  in  the  United  States,  nuclear  utilities
turned their operations around, focusing on management excellence
and  safety,  making  more  nuclear-generated  electricity  than  at  any
time  in  history.  Through  improvements  in  operation,  U.S.  utilities
have  added  the  equivalent  of  25  new  nuclear  plants  to  the  U.S.
grid  since  1990  without  building  any  new  plants.  U.S.  utilities  are
working with us and others to explore the construction of new U.S.
nuclear plants for the first time in decades.

Madame Chairman, I have no doubt that our work under the Nu-
clear  Power  2010  program  has  contributed  to  these  positive  devel-
opments.  Through  this  effort,  we  have  helped  to  organize  industry
to  take  the  next  vital  steps  toward  the  next  U.S.  nuclear  power
plant.

Finally,  Madame  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  note  that  in  Feb-
ruary,  we  also  successfully  launched  the  new  Idaho  National  Lab-

53

oratory.  The  development  of  this  new  laboratory  is  an  essential
step  in  furthering  our  nuclear  energy  research  agenda.  We  now,
like  the  other  DOE  programs  represented  here  today,  have  a  core
laboratory that can serve as our command center for our program’s
key  research  efforts.  This  new  lab,  working  closely  with  other  key
National  Laboratories,  industry,  academia,  and  the  international
community,  will  help  us  to  implement  an  exciting,  world-changing
agenda aimed at delivering new energy technologies that will foster
economic  growth  and  a  healthier  environment  for  generations  to
come.

I conclude my remarks, Madame Chairman, by thanking you for

your leadership and partnership with us in this endeavor.

Thank you. I look forward to your questions.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT SHANE JOHNSON

Chairman  Biggert,  Representative  Honda,  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  it
is a pleasure to be here to discuss the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 budget submission for
DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology.

In  his  February  2nd  State  of  the  Union  Address,  the  President  underscored  the
need  to  restrain  spending  in  order  to  sustain  our  economic  prosperity.  As  part  of
this  restraint,  it  is  important  that  total  discretionary  and  non-security  spending  be
held  to  levels  proposed  in  the  FY  2006  Budget.  The  budget  savings  and  reforms  in
the  Budget  are  important  components  of  achieving  the  President’s  goal  of  cutting
the  budget  deficit  in  half  by  2009  and  we  urge  the  Congress  to  support  these  re-
forms. The FY 2006 Budget includes more than 150 reductions, reforms, and termi-
nations  in  non-defense  discretionary  programs,  of  which  six  affect  Department  of
Energy  programs.  The  Department  wants  to  work  with  the  Congress  to  achieve
these savings.

Of  these  six  programs,  two  programs  are  from  the  Office  of  Nuclear  Energy,
Science  and  Technology:  the  Nuclear  Energy  Plant  Optimization  (NEPO)  and  the
Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) programs. Research conducted under the
NEPO  program  is  designed  to  assure  the  ability  of  currently  operating  nuclear
power plants to remain in service up to and beyond their licensed operating period.
No funding is requested for the NEPO program in FY 2006 because industry is com-
mitted to continuing the research begun under NEPO without DOE support, allow-
ing  DOE  to  focus  on  higher  priority  activities.  No  stand-alone  funding  is  requested
for  the  NERI  program  as  the  Department’s  principal  nuclear  energy  research  and
development  (R&D)  programs  (Generation  IV  Nuclear  Energy  Systems  Initiative,
Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, and Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative) will be sponsoring
NERI  research  projects  within  the  Nation’s  university  research  community  to  en-
hance the research cooperation between academia and our national laboratories and
to strengthen our mainline R&D programs.

For most of our nation’s history, America’s vibrant economy and society have ben-
efited  from  the  abundant  energy  options  we  have  had  available.  Even  though  we
experienced oil price shocks in the 1970s and 1980s, the vast majority of the energy
used  in  the  United  States  is,  even  today,  produced  in  the  United  States.  Our  coal,
oil, natural gas, nuclear, and renewable resources all contribute to a diversified and
reliable energy picture.

However, we are entering a new era in energy supply. As highlighted in the Presi-
dent’s  National  Energy  Policy,  forecasts  indicate  that  our  need  for  energy—even
with  ambitious  implementation  of  energy  efficiency  measures  across  all  sectors  of
the economy—will continue to grow as our economy grows. The Energy Information
Administration  forecasts  that  by  2025,  the  United  States  will  import  38  percent  of
all of its energy and 68 percent of its energy for transportation uses. Buried in these
estimates is an ominous fact that has escaped casual notice—the U.S. will, over this
period,  begin  a  steadily  increasing  dependence  on  imports  for  fuels  needed  for  elec-
tricity  generation  that  may,  over  the  coming  decades,  follow  the  patterns  of  our  ac-
celerating dependence on imports required for the transportation sector.

To meet these challenges while still assuring America’s access to reliable baseload
electricity—while  setting  a  path  toward  reduced  emissions—we  must  apply  ad-
vanced  technologies.  New  technology  can  help  us  to  exploit  renewable  energy
sources  when  they  are  practical,  and  enable  coal  to  continue  as  a  viable,  long-term
element  of  our  energy  supply.  And  as  the  President  conveyed  in  his  State  of  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:35 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 020735 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ENER05\042705\20735 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

54

Union  address,  we  must  consider  new  nuclear  energy  as  part  of  our  long-term  en-
ergy picture.

The  Department  of  Energy’s  nuclear  energy  program  has  made  significant
progress  over  the  past  several  years.  From  the  time,  not  so  many  years  ago,  when
it  appeared  that  the  United  States  might  abandon  advanced  nuclear  research  and
development,  we  have  been  successful  in  reasserting  U.S.  leadership  in  this  area
around the world. Representing the United States, I have been elected by my inter-
national colleagues to serve as the chair of two important international bodies—the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development Steering Committee on Nu-
clear Energy and the Generation IV International Forum.

We  continue  to  build  on  our  leadership.  Just  a  few  weeks  ago,  we  celebrated  the
launch of the Nation’s central laboratory for nuclear research and development—the
Idaho  National  Laboratory  (INL).  This  new  national  laboratory  combines  the  re-
sources  of  the  former  Idaho  National  Engineering  and  Environmental  Laboratory
(INEEL) and the former Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL–W). The INL will
lead  much  of  the  Department’s  exploration  into  advanced  nuclear  reactor  and  fuel
cycle  technology.  We  have  set  an  aggressive  goal  for  the  new  INL  to  become  the
world’s  premier  center  for  nuclear  energy  research  and  education  within  a  decade.
Developing  a  central  research  laboratory  is  a  major  step  forward  for  the  nuclear
energy  program.  We,  like  other  key  energy  programs  at  the  Department,  have  cre-
ated  a  central,  dedicated  research  site  at  which  we  can  consolidate  our  infrastruc-
ture  investments  and  build  the  expertise  needed  to  accomplish  our  long-term  pro-
gram goals. A central lab also helps us minimize the shipment of nuclear materials
across the country and allows us to bring our nuclear materials together in a single,
secure location. In addition, we expect that our new central, dedicated research lab-
oratory  will  become  a  major  player  in  the  education  of  the  next  generation  of  nu-
clear  energy  technologists  that  this  nation  will  need  to  assure  our  energy  security
in the future.

The  Department’s  FY  2006  request  for  the  nuclear  energy  program  proposes  a
$511  million  (an  increase  of  $25  million  compared  to  FY  2005)  investment  in  nu-
clear  research,  development,  education  and  infrastructure  for  the  Nation’s  future
that  is  designed  to  continue  this  progress.  This  budget  request  demonstrates  our
commitment  to  support  the  President’s  priorities  of  enhancing  the  Nation’s  energy
independence and security while limiting air pollution. Our request supports the de-
velopment  of  new  nuclear  generation  technologies  and  advanced  energy  products
that  will  provide  significant  improvements  in  the  economics,  sustainability,  safety
and reliability of nuclear-based energy, as well as its resistance to proliferation and
terrorism.

We  are  committed  to  efficiently  managing  the  funds  we  are  provided.  We  have
abandoned outdated field office and laboratory management paradigms and have in-
tegrated  the  Idaho  Operations  Office  with  our  headquarters  organization,  enabling
us  to  closely  manage  our  responsibilities  in  the  field  to  achieve  greater  quality  and
efficiency. We are enhancing our expertise in critical areas such as project manage-
ment through training and certification of existing staff and the acquisition of expe-
rienced,  proven  managers.  We  are  also  applying  international  and  public-private
partnerships  in  the  implementation  of  our  research  and  development  programs  as
a  way  of  leveraging  our  investments  and  assuring  the  utility  of  our  programs.  We
believe  these  steps  must  be  taken  to  assure  our  program’s  ability  to  make  the  best
use of the taxpayer dollars.

While we have made great progress in all these areas, much remains to be done.

Our FY 2006 request moves us in the right direction.
FISCAL YEAR 2006 BUDGET REQUEST
NUCLEAR POWER 2010

Today, American utilities operate 103 nuclear power plants. These facilities oper-
ate  reliably  and  efficiently  and  provide  a  fifth  of  the  Nation’s  electricity.  These
plants are emissions-free and can operate year-round in all weather conditions.

Over  the  last  15  years,  nuclear  utilities  in  the  United  States  have  been  increas-
ingly better managed, improving both efficiency and safety. In the early 1990s, U.S.
plants  were  available  to  produce  energy  only  70  percent  of  the  time  on  average.
These  plants  are  now  producing  power  over  90  percent  of  the  time.  More  efficient
operation has allowed nuclear plant operators to produce more energy than ever be-
fore,  adding  the  equivalent  of  25  new  nuclear  plants  to  the  U.S.  grid  since  1990
without building any new nuclear power plants.

Consolidation of nuclear plant ownership to a fewer number of excellent operators
has made the operation of U.S. plants safer than ever, more cost-effective, and more
reliable. Companies acquiring nuclear plants are the leaders in the nuclear industry
with  high  marks  in  operating  performance.  These  utilities  bring  newly  acquired

55

plants  the  benefit  of  economies  of  scale,  experienced  staff,  well-honed  management
processes. As a result of this success, essentially all U.S. nuclear plants are expected
to apply for renewed licenses that will keep most plants in operation into the middle
of the century. There will also be some new generation, with The Tennessee Valley
Authority  rebuilding  a  plant  that  ceased  operating  in  1985.  TVA  expects  to  invest
$1.8 billion to bring a 1,065-megawatt plant on-line by 2007.

With renewed interest from industry, the Department is investing in the Nuclear
Power 2010 Program. This program’s basic missions are to cost-share with industry
demonstration of new, untested Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing processes,
finding  sites  on  which  to  build  new  plants,  and  certifying  state-of-the-art  (or  ‘‘Gen-
eration III+’’) designs for new nuclear power plants. The program also conducts eco-
nomic  studies  and  analysis  that  help  point  to  the  barriers  facing  the  construction
of new plants.

While it is too early to determine success, this program appears to be on the right
track. Three utilities are cooperating with the Department to obtain ‘‘Early Site Per-
mits’’ for three sites across the country—the first time this important regulatory tool
has ever been used. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is currently reviewing the
utilities’  applications  and  is  expected  to  issue  these  permits  during  FY  2006.  Once
done, these utilities will have sites that are pre-approved by regulators to host new
plants.  This  process  will  avoid  the  problems  in  siting  that  vastly  escalated  the  cost
of  some  plants  in  the  1980s  and  led  to  the  abandonment  of  others  (most  notably
the Shoreham plant in New York).

In  November  2004,  the  Nuclear  Power  2010  program  took  its  next  major  step  by
awarding  two  major  projects  to  utility-led  consortia  to  implement  plans  that  could
lead  to  the  construction  and  operation  of  new  U.S.  nuclear  plants.  Central  to  this
effort, these projects will demonstrate—again, for the first time—the Nuclear Regu-
latory Commission’s combined Construction/Operating License (or ‘‘one-step’’ license)
process. These projects could result in a new nuclear power plant order by 2009 and
a  new  nuclear  power  plant  constructed  by  the  private  sector  and  in  operation  by
2014.

In  addition  to  regulatory  barriers,  it  is  also  important  to  deal  with  the  financial
barriers  facing  new  nuclear  power  plant  projects.  Under  the  Nuclear  Power  2010
program,  DOE  sponsored  an  independent  study  by  the  University  of  Chicago’s  De-
partment  of  Economics.  This  study  found  that  the  first  few  nuclear  power  plants
built  in  the  United  States  would  be  too  costly  for  utilities  to  build  because  of  early
plant  costs.  These  high  initial  costs  arise  because  the  United  States  has  not  built
nuclear  plants  in  a  very  long  time—the  resulting  new  design,  construction,  licens-
ing,  and  financial  uncertainties  are  reflected  as  higher  costs.  However,  the  study
found that once these early plant costs are absorbed, new nuclear power plants may
be  less  expensive  to  build  and  operate  than  either  coal-based  power  plants  or  nat-
ural gas-fired plants.

The need to deal with these early plant costs is expected to become a central issue
for the industry as the Nuclear Power 2010 program addresses the institutional bar-
riers.  Without  the  construction  of  new  plants,  the  contribution  of  nuclear  power  as
a  percentage  of  the  Nation’s  total  energy  mix  will  steadily  decline.  Supporting  nu-
clear  power  helps  to  maintain  a  more  diversified  energy  supply  and,  because  it  is
emissions-free,  will  not  contribute  to  air  pollution—nuclear  power  today  comprises
almost  75  percent  of  all  the  non-emitting  power  generation  in  the  country.  The
President’s Budget supports continuation of the Nuclear Power 2010 initiative in FY
2006  with  a  request  of  $56  million  (an  increase  of  $6.4  million  compared  to  FY
2005).

Our  Generation  IV  effort  continues  to  make  significant  progress.  Since  the  Gen-
eration  IV  International  Forum  (GIF)  and  the  Nuclear  Energy  Research  Advisory
Committee  (NERAC)  issued  their  joint  report,  A  Technology  Roadmap  for  Genera-
tion  IV  Nuclear  Energy  Systems,  the  members  of  the  Forum  have  expanded  to  in-
clude  Switzerland  and  the  European  Union.  The  now  eleven  members  (Argentina,
Brazil, Canada, the European Union, France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Re-
public  of  South  Africa,  Switzerland,  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States)
have organized into interest groups associated with each of the six selected Genera-
tion IV.

A landmark international framework agreement for collaborative research and de-
velopment  among  the  GIF  member  countries  was  signed  in  Washington,  D.C.,  by
the  United  States  and  its  GIF  partners  on  February  28,  2005.  The  Framework
Agreement  for  International  Collaboration  on  Research  and  Development  of  Genera-
tion IV Nuclear Energy Systems, which has been under negotiation for the past year,

will  allow  the  United  States  and  its  partner  countries  to  embark  on  joint,  cost-
shared  research  and  development  of  Generation  IV  nuclear  energy  systems.  These
next-generation nuclear technologies offer the potential for significant improvements
in sustainability, proliferation resistance, physical protection, safety and economics.
The agreement will further the development of advanced technologies that are wide-
ly  acceptable;  enable  the  Department  to  access  the  best  expertise  in  the  world  to
develop complex new technologies; and allow us to leverage our scarce nuclear R&D
resources.

With  this  agreement  in  place,  we  are  moving  forward  with  these  countries  to  de-
velop  advanced  reactor  technologies  that  could  be  made  available  in  the  2020  to
2030  timeframe.  Generation  IV  concepts  offer  significant  improvements  in  the  sus-
tainability, proliferation resistance, physical protection, safety and economics of nu-
clear  energy.  These  advanced  systems  will  not  only  be  safe,  economic  and  secure,
but  will  also  include  energy  conversion  systems  that  produce  non-electricity  prod-
ucts  such  as  hydrogen,  desalinated  water  and  process  heat.  These  features  make
Generation  IV  reactors  ideal  for  meeting  the  President’s  energy  and  environmental
objectives.

We  will  explore  a  range  of  Generation  IV  concepts,  including  the  Supercritical
Water-Cooled Reactor, the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor and the Lead-Cooled Fast Reac-
tor.  Our  efforts  will  focus  on  establishing  technical  and  economic  viability,  and  de-
veloping  core  and  fuel  designs,  and  advanced  materials  for  these  concepts.  We  re-
quest $45 million (an increase of $5.3 million compared to FY 2005) support our in-
vestigation  of  technical  and  economic  challenges  and  risks,  including  waste  prod-
ucts,  to  inform  a  decision  on  whether  to  proceed  with  a  demonstration  of  the  Next
Generation  Nuclear  Plant  (NGNP),  which  would  use  very  high  temperature  reactor
technologies  to  economically  produce  both  electricity  and  hydrogen  gas.  The  Presi-
dent’s  Budget  supports  advanced  research  into  the  systems,  materials,  and  fuels
that are needed to bring Generation IV concepts to fruition. Key to the strategy for
conducting  all  Generation  IV  research  and  development  is  the  multiplication  effect
derived  from  international  collaboration.  By  coordinating  U.S.  efforts  with  those  of
the GIF partner nations, our funding is leveraged by a factor of two to ten, depend-
ing on the reactor concept involved.

We  are  also  working  in  close  cooperation  with  the  Department’s  Office  of  Science
through  the  ‘‘Materials  for  Advanced  Energy  Systems  Initiative’’  to  coordinate  the
research  advanced  materials  for  use  in  Generation  IV  nuclear  energy  systems,  fu-
sion energy systems, and advanced energy technologies such as hydrogen production
systems. Through a joint working group, the offices are coordinating on energy ma-
terials  related  issues  with  the  purpose  of  investigating  materials  behavior  in  high
temperature,  radiation,  and  hostile  corrosive  environments,  as  well  as  the  fabrica-
tion  and  non-destructive  evaluation  or  monitoring  of  such  materials.  As  common
projects  are  identified,  the  offices  will  work  to  establish  research  objectives  and  co-
operative work plans to leverage research funding.

NUCLEAR HYDROGEN INITIATIVE

Hydrogen  offers  significant  promise  as  a  future  domestic  energy  source,  particu-
larly for the transportation sector. The use of hydrogen in transportation will reduce
U.S.  dependence  on  foreign  sources  of  petroleum,  enhancing  national  security.  Hy-
drogen can be combusted in a traditional internal combustion engine, or can produce
electricity  in  a  fuel  cell.  Significant  progress  in  hydrogen  combustion  engines  and
fuel  cells  is  bringing  transportation  using  hydrogen  closer  to  reality.  Before  hydro-
gen can become a significant part of the Nation’s energy infrastructure, the cost as-
sociated with the production, storage, and delivery of hydrogen must be reduced con-
siderably.

Today,  through  electrolysis,  we  can  convert  water  to  hydrogen  using  electricity.
Without  using  a  non-emitting  technology,  such  as  nuclear  or  renewable  energy,  to
produce  the  electricity,  the  environmental  benefits  of  electrolysis  are  negated.  We
believe that for the future, Generation IV systems coupled with advanced hydrogen
production technology offer a more efficient technology for production of large quan-
tities  of  hydrogen  without  release  of  greenhouse  gases.  This  technology  could  pave
the way for the commercial production of clean-burning hydrogen for transportation
purposes—reducing  our  reliance  on  imported  fossil  fuels  and  supporting  the  Presi-
dent’s vision for a future Hydrogen economy.

The  DOE  Hydrogen  Posture  Plan  and  the  Nuclear  Hydrogen  R&D  Plan  outline
our  plan  for  integrating  and  implementing  technology  research,  development  and
demonstration activities needed to cost-effectively produce, store, and distribute hy-
drogen  for  use  in  fuel  cell  vehicles  and  electricity  generation.  These  documents  are
revised periodically and used to inform our annual budget requests. Technology de-

velopment  work  to  date,  which  has  been  conducted  in  accordance  with  these  plans,
has  proven  successful.  For  example,  last  year,  experiments  were  successfully  com-
pleted  on  individual  high-temperature  electrolysis  cells  for  hydrogen  production.
Since the results show that the hydrogen output of the cells closely matched the the-
oretical  calculations,  this  year  we  are  evaluating  the  performance  of  stacks  of  cells
to  achieve  higher  hydrogen  production  rates.  In  FY  2006,  the  program  will  proceed
with  the  plan  to  test  cell  stacks  for  long-duration  and  transient  operation.  As  a  re-
sult of these achievements, the FY 2006 budget request includes an increase of $11
million  to  conduct  research  and  development  on  processes  that  operate  across  a
range  of  temperatures  for  various  advanced  reactors  being  considered  under  the
Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative.

ADVANCED FUEL CYCLE INITIATIVE

In  addition  to  leading  the  development  of  a  new  generation  of  nuclear  power
plants,  the  Department  is  developing  and  demonstrating  technologies  that  will  en-
able  the  United  States  and  other  advanced  countries  to  implement  an  improved,
long-term  nuclear  fuel  cycle  that  provides  substantial  environmental,  nonprolifera-
tion, and economic advantages over the current once-through nuclear fuel cycle. The
Advanced  Fuel  Cycle  Initiative  is  a  research  program  to  develop  new  technologies
for reducing the volume, toxicity, and longevity of the high-level nuclear wastes that
result from the production of energy from nuclear power plants. The initiative is de-
signed so that these technologies can be made available to support the operation of
current  nuclear  power  plants,  Generation  III+  light-water  reactors,  and  Generation
IV  advanced  reactors  in  order  to  achieve  a  significant  reduction  in  the  amount  of
high-level  radioactive  waste  requiring  geologic  disposal;  to  significantly  reduce  the
amount of plutonium accumulated in civilian spent nuclear fuel; and to extract more
useful energy from nuclear fuel.

Under  all  scenarios,  the  Nation  will  need  to  establish  a  permanent  geological  re-
pository to deal with the radioactive wastes resulting from the operation of nuclear
power plants. Substantial growth in the use of nuclear energy in the United States
will  require  the  construction  of  additional  geologic  repositories  to  address  the  nu-
clear  waste  generated  over  time.  The  advanced  research  conducted  under  the  Ad-
vanced  Fuel  Cycle  Initiative,  if  successful,  could  provide  an  alternative  to  building
multiple  ‘‘Yucca  Mountains’’  while  still  supporting  an  expanding  role  for  nuclear
power  in  the  United  States.  In  the  longer-term,  the  Advance  Fuel  Cycle  Initiative
could  enable  us  to  extend  the  useful  life  of  the  Yucca  Mountain  repository  and  re-
duce the radiotoxicity of the wastes it contains such that it would decay to the tox-
icity of natural uranium ore in less than 1,000 years—instead of over 100,000 years
as  is  the  case  with  untreated  spent  fuel.  This  technology  could  also  allow  nuclear
plants to exploit a far higher fraction of the energy contained in uranium ore, poten-
tially  expanding  the  lifetime  of  the  world’s  nuclear  fuel  resources  from  around  100
years up to 1,000 years.

The  Advanced  Fuel  Cycle  Initiative,  with  an  investment  of  $70  million  for  FY
2006  (an  increase  of  $2.5  million  compared  to  FY  2005),  will  continue  the  progress
made  in  the  development  of  proliferation-resistant  treatment  and  transmutation
technologies  that  can  reduce  both  the  volume  and  toxicity  of  spent  nuclear  fuel.
These  technologies  would  support  both  national  security  and  energy  independence
by reducing inventories of commercially-generated plutonium while recovering resid-
ual energy value from spent nuclear fuel. If successful, these same technologies offer
benefits of enhancing national security by reducing inventories of commercially-gen-
erated  plutonium  and  enhancing  energy  independence  by  recovering  the  energy
value contained in spent nuclear fuel.

The program has already enjoyed considerable success. We have proven the ability
of our URanium EXtraction (UREX) technology to separate uranium from spent fuel
at a very high level of purity. We have demonstrated the ability of a derivative tech-
nology,  UREX+,  to  separate  a  combined  mixture  of  plutonium  and  neptunium  that
can  serve  as  the  basis  for  a  proliferation-resistant  fuel  for  light  water  reactors.
While  the  UREX+  process  has  great  potential  to  address  the  spent  fuel  challenges
associated  with  today’s  light  water  reactors,  we  have  also  been  investigating  an  al-
ternative separation technology called pyroprocessing. This technology is a highly ef-
ficient,  proliferation-resistant  nonaqueous  approach  to  separate  the  actinides  in
spent fuel from fission products. Among other potential applications, pyroprocessing
could support the reduction of the radiotoxicity of nuclear waste through the trans-
mutation  of  minor  actinides  in  future  Generation  IV  fast  spectrum  reactors  pro-
viding the means for closure of the fuel cycle for Generation IV fast reactors.

For  the  Advanced  Fuel  Cycle  Initiative  to  be  successful,  advanced  fuel  treatment
and  transmutation  research  and  development  must  be  integrated  with  the  develop-

ment of Generation IV nuclear energy systems, particularly with those reactor tech-
nologies that can produce the high energy neutrons needed to transmute a wide va-
riety of toxic radioactive species. We have organized our national labs, universities,
and international collaborations in a manner that will enable the success of the Ad-
vanced Fuel Cycle Initiative.

UNIVERSITY  REACTOR  INFRASTRUCTURE  AND  EDUCATION  ASSIST-

ANCE

In  addition,  the  Department  has  paid  close  attention  to  developments  impacting
university research reactors. The research conducted using these facilities is critical
to  many  national  priorities.  Currently,  there  are  27  operating  university  research
reactors  at  26  campuses  in  20  states.  These  reactors  are  providing  support  for  re-
search  in  such  diverse  areas  as  medical  isotopes,  human  health,  life  sciences,  envi-
ronmental  protection,  advanced  materials,  lasers,  energy  conversion  and  food  irra-
diation.

The  most  exciting  development  in  University  Reactor  Infrastructure  and  Edu-
cation Assistance is the Innovations in Nuclear Infrastructure and Education (INIE)
Program  established  in  FY  2002.  The  consortia  have  demonstrated  remarkable  col-
laborative  efforts  and  strong  formation  of  strategic  partnerships  between  univer-
sities,  national  laboratories,  and  industry.  These  partnerships  have  resulted  in  in-
creased  use  of  the  university  nuclear  reactor  research  and  training  facilities,  up-
grading  of  facilities,  increased  support  for  students,  and  additional  research  oppor-
tunities  for  students,  faculty  and  other  interested  researchers.  Today,  the  Depart-
ment  funds  six  INIE  consortia,  providing  support  to  32  universities  in  23  states
across the Nation.

To complement INIE and the other university assistance programs, the University
Reactor  Infrastructure  and  Education  Assistance  program  provides  assistance  to
universities  to  improve  the  operational  and  experimental  capabilities  of  their  re-
search  reactors  and  provides  for  the  fabrication  and  shipment  of  fresh  fuel  to  their
research reactors.

Grants are provided to universities to purchase equipment and services necessary
to upgrade the reactor facilities, such as reactor instrumentation and control equip-
ment, data recording devices, radiation, security and air monitoring equipment, and
gamma spectroscopy hardware and software. Each year, as many as 25 universities
request  and  receive  this  assistance.  The  Reactor  Sharing  program  enables  univer-
sities  with  reactors  to  ‘‘share’’  access  to  their  facilities  with  students  and  faculty  at
their  own  institutions,  with  universities  that  lack  such  a  facility,  and  with  visiting
students from other local institutions including high schools and middle schools. The
reactors  are  made  available  for  use  in  research,  experiments,  material  irradiations,
neutron activation analysis and training, and for facility tours and other educational
activities.

The growth of nuclear energy in the United States is dependent on the preserva-
tion  of  the  education  and  training  infrastructure  at  universities.  The  Department
has played a substantial role in reversing the decline in undergraduate enrollments
in  this  area  of  study.  In  1998,  the  United  States  saw  only  around  450  students  en-
roll  as  nuclear  engineers—down  from  almost  1,500  in  1992.  After  several  years  of
focused  effort,  the  United  States  now  has  nearly  1,600  students  studying  nuclear
engineering.  That  number  is  set  to  increase  further,  as  strong  programs—such  as
at  Purdue  and  Texas  A&M—continue  to  grow  and  we  see  new  programs  start  at
schools  such  as  South  Carolina  State  University,  the  University  of  South  Carolina,
and  the  University  of  Nevada-Las  Vegas.  Given  the  very  large  number  of  retire-
ments expected in the nuclear field over the next five to ten years, industry, govern-
ment,  and  academia  find  that  this  upswing  in  student  interest  comes  at  a  critical
time.

The  Department  provides  tuition,  stipends,  and  a  practicum  to  outstanding  grad-
uate students studying nuclear engineering and health physics and scholarships and
a  practicum  to  undergraduate  students  pursuing  a  nuclear  engineering  course  of
study.  This  highly  competitive  program  has  produced  outstanding  graduates  who
have  become  leaders  in  nuclear  research  and  university  education.  Also,  within  the
fellowships and scholarships program is the University Partnership program, which
encourages  students  enrolled  at  minority-serving  institutions  to  pursue  a  nuclear
engineering  degree  at  universities  with  nuclear  engineering  programs.  There  are
currently  six  university  partnerships  consisting  of  13  institutions  working  coopera-
tively  in  this  innovative  program.  South  Carolina  State  University  (SCSU)  and  the
University  of  Wisconsin  were  involved  in  the  pilot  program  and  now  SCSU  admin-
isters  the  program  for  all  university  partnership  members.  SCSU  has  also  added
two nuclear engineering faculty members and has become the only historically black

college  or  university  in  the  United  States  with  an  accredited  nuclear  engineering
program.

We  continue  our  small  but  important  effort  to  provide  scholarships  and  graduate
fellowships  to  students  studying  the  vital  and  too-often  overlooked  discipline  of
health  physics.  The  Department  is  concerned  that  the  Nation  may  soon  not  have
the  trained  health  physicists  who  are  needed  to  assure  the  safety  of  vital  nuclear
and  radiological  activities.  This  program  will  help  heighten  the  visibility  of  health
physics  as  a  viable  career  opportunity  and  strengthen  the  health  physics  pipeline
to replace retiring professionals.

The  Nuclear  Engineering  Education  Support  program  prepares  students  for  nu-
clear  engineering  and  science  careers  and  assists  universities  with  special  needs  to
improve  their  educational  infrastructure.  This  program  is  helping  to  address  the
knowledge gap of incoming college freshmen in the area of nuclear science and engi-
neering.  In  FY  2005  a  nuclear  science  and  technology  education  pilot  was  estab-
lished between the Department and the Pittsburgh Public School System to provide
advanced  placement  high  school  science  students  an  intensive  educational  experi-
ence in the field of nuclear science and technology. This effort provides course mate-
rials,  tours  to  nuclear  facilities,  and  lectures  from  internationally-recognized  ex-
perts.  In  FY  2006,  the  program  will  expand  its  efforts  to  enlist  local  organizations
in  sponsoring  the  model  used  in  the  Pittsburgh  pilot  program  to  other  school  sys-
tems across the country, thereby strengthening the understanding of nuclear science
in our public schools.

The  President’s  Budget  supports  continuation  of  the  University  Reactor  Infra-
structure and Education Assistance Program in FY 2006 with a request of $24 mil-
lion (an increase $190K compared to FY 2005).

RADIOLOGICAL FACILITIES MANAGEMENT

In addition to nuclear research and development programs, we have the responsi-
bility  to  maintain  and  enhance  the  Nation’s  nuclear  science  and  technology  infra-
structure. This budget request also includes $64.8 million (a decrease of $3.7 million
compared  to  FY  2005)  to  fund  the  management  of  the  Department’s  vital  resources
and  capabilities  at  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory,  Los  Alamos  National  Labora-
tory,  Sandia  National  Laboratory,  and  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory  in  a  safe,
secure,  and  cost  effective  manner  to  support  national  priorities.  The  mission  of  the
Radiological Facilities Management program is to maintain these critical user facili-
ties  in  a  safe,  environmentally-compliant  and  cost-effective  manner  to  support  na-
tional priorities. These funds assure that NE facilities meet essential safety and en-
vironmental  requirements  and  are  maintained  at  user-ready  levels.  Actual  oper-
ations, production, research, or other additional activities are funded either by other
DOE programs, by the private sector, or by other federal agency users.

The  Department  is  responsible  for  maintaining  the  necessary  nuclear  material
and  infrastructure  that  is  required  to  deliver  plutonium-238-fueled  radioisotope
power systems (using plutonium-238) to various federal users. These systems are an
irreplaceable  enabling  technology  for  deep  space  exploration  missions  and  national
security  missions.  As  part  of  the  Department’s  emphasis  on  consolidating  nuclear
material, increasing nuclear security, reducing nuclear risks, and addressing secure
transportation  issues,  we  are  currently  performing  an  environmental  review  to  as-
sess  the  consolidation  of  all  of  our  plutonium-238  operations.  DOE  has  identified
consolidation at the Idaho National Laboratory as the preferred alternative for this
proposed action.

In  addition,  the  Radiological  Facilities  Management  program  assures  appropriate
oversight  of  the  operations  and  maintenance  of  the  Department’s  Paducah  Gaseous
Diffusion  Plant  uranium  enrichment  facilities  to  assure  that  USEC  Inc.  meets  its
commitments  under  the  2002  DOE–USEC  Agreement  and  that  the  Government’s
rights and options are being preserved.

The  FY  2006  $64.8  million  budget  request  includes  $18.7  million  to  prepare  the
final  design,  procure  equipment,  and  begin  facility  modifications  for  the  Uranium-
233  Disposition  Project  at  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory.  This  project  is  aimed  at
stabilizing  materials  left  over  from  the  Cold  War  to  address  a  Defense  Nuclear  Fa-
cilities  Safety  Board  recommendation,  while  extracting  isotopes  from  the  uranium
that are needed for very promising medical research.

IDAHO  FACILITIES  MANAGEMENT  AND  IDAHO  SITEWIDE  SAFE-

GUARDS AND SECURITY

The  Idaho  Facilities  Management  program  maintains  the  Department’s  facilities
at  Idaho  in  a  safe,  secure  and  environmentally  compliant  condition  for  a  range  of
vital  federal  missions.  The  Idaho  Site-wide  Safeguards  and  Security  program  sup-
ports  activities  that  are  required  to  protect  the  Department’s  Idaho  complex  assets
from  theft,  diversion,  sabotage,  espionage,  unauthorized  access,  compromise,  and
other  hostile  acts  which  may  cause  unacceptable  adverse  impacts  on  national  secu-
rity, program continuity, the health and safety of employees, the public, or the envi-
ronment.

We  have  now  established  the  Idaho  National  Laboratory  (INL),  which  combines
the resources of the former Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Labora-
tory  (INEEL)  and  the  former  Argonne  National  Laboratory-West  (ANL–W).  This
new  lab  began  operations  on  February  1,  2005,  and  will  lead  much  of  the  Depart-
ment’s exploration into advanced nuclear reactor and fuel cycle technology. We have
set an aggressive goal for the new INL to become the world’s premier center for nu-
clear energy research and education within a decade.

Developing  a  central  research  laboratory  is  a  major  step  forward  for  the  nuclear
energy program. We have now joined the other key energy programs at the Depart-
ment  by  having  a  central,  dedicated  research  site  at  which  we  can  centralize  our
infrastructure  investments  and  build  the  expertise  needed  to  accomplish  our  pro-
gram goals. A central lab also helps us minimize the shipment of nuclear materials
across the country and allows us to bring our nuclear materials together in a single,
secure location. In addition, we expect that our new central, dedicated research lab-
oratory  will  become  a  major  player  in  the  education  of  the  next  generation  of  nu-
clear  energy  technologists  that  this  nation  will  need  to  assure  our  energy  security
in the future.

Our  funding  request  of  $80.1  million  from  Energy  Supply  and  $17.8  million  from
Other  Defense  Activities  for  the  Idaho  Facilities  Management  program  maintains
and  operates  the  Department’s  facilities  at  Idaho  in  a  safe,  reliable,  and  environ-
mentally compliant condition for a range of vital federal missions. The overall fund-
ing  for  the  Idaho  Facilities  Management  program  decreases  from  FY  2005  to  FY
2006 because of a $43.4 million one-time cost associated with restructuring the INL
complex and supporting site infrastructure services. This decrease is offset by an in-
crease  of  $19.7  million  for  maintenance  and  recapitalization  projects  to  support  the
goal of achieving and maintaining an expenditure rate of two to four percent of Re-
placement  Plant  Value,  a  level  recommended  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences
and incorporated in Departmental guidance, for the facilities at INL. One of the es-
sential facilities for ongoing and planned national security and energy research pro-
grams  at  the  INL  is  the  Advanced  Test  Reactor  (ATR).  Replacing  the  ATR  with  a
new test reactor with similar capabilities would exceed two billion dollars and likely
take  at  least  ten  years  to  build.  An  independent  review  group  of  reactor  experts
studied the ATR and provided their perspectives on the life extension of the reactor.
This  review  prompted  several  projects,  most  notably  an  exhaustive  safety  basis  re-
constitution  to  assure  that  all  safety  related  systems  meet  modern  standards.  This
project is in progress and results to date are favorable.

The  recommendations  of  this  review  and  other  analyses  will  be  incorporated  into
the  INL  Ten  Year  Site  Plan  (TYSP),  which  is  the  foundation  for  INL  facilities  and
infrastructure  strategic  planning  and  the  cornerstone  of  the  Program’s  initiative  to
restore the INL and the other essential facilities on the site. The TYSP provides rec-
ommendations for short- and long-term recapitalization of existing mission essential
facilities  and  infrastructure.  The  TYSP  identifies  and  prioritizes  the  project,  activi-
ties,  and  mission  resource  requirements  for  real  property  assets  that  cover  a  ten-
year  planning  horizon  as  well  as  includes  a  prioritized  list  of  maintenance,  repair,
and recapitalization projects necessary to correct the maintenance backlog.

Our  budget  request  of  $75  million  (an  increase  of  $17.3  million  compared  to  FY
2005)  from  the  Other  Defense  Activities  appropriations  account  for  the  Idaho
Sitewide  Safeguards  and  Security  program  supports  activities  that  are  required  to
protect the Department’s Idaho complex assets from theft, diversion, sabotage, espi-
onage, unauthorized access, compromise, and other hostile acts which may cause un-
acceptable adverse impacts on national security, program continuity, the health and
safety  of  employees,  the  public,  or  the  environment.  As  a  result  of  merging  the
former  INEEL  and  ANL–W  sites  into  the  INL,  the  two  existing  safeguards  and  se-
curity  programs  at  the  Idaho  site  will  be  merged  into  a  single  program.  This  inte-
gration will continue in FY 2005 with additional changes anticipated to increase ef-
ficiency and contain costs for safeguards and security for the site.

The Department issued a revised Design Basis Threat in October 2004. These re-
quirements  will  be  implemented  using  a  risk-informed  approach  to  physical  up-
grades and by seeking efficiencies associated with combining the two contracts. The
Department  believes  that  early  investment  in  improved  positions  for  defending
forces, more capable detection systems, and technological deterrent devices at target
locations  will  result  in  cost  avoidance  over  the  lifetime  of  enduring  facilities  by  re-
ducing the number of additional protective force members needed to counter the re-
vised threat. The FY 2006 request reflects increased funding of $17.3 million to per-
mit these investments.
CONCLUSION

Our  nation  cannot  rely  on  any  single  energy  technology  to  secure  its  future.  A
broadly diverse energy supply has served us well in the past and must be available
for  the  future.  Nuclear  energy  should  be  a  part  of  that  diverse  portfolio  as  look  to
support our growing economy while limiting air emissions and enhancing America’s
energy independence.

The Department of Energy’s goal is to work with the private sector, our overseas
partners,  and  other  agencies  to  assure  that  the  benefits  of  nuclear  technology  con-
tinue  to  increase  the  security  and  quality  of  life  for  Americans—and  other  citizens
of the world—now and into the future.

This  concludes  my  prepared  statement.  Your  leadership  and  guidance  has  been
essential  to  the  progress  the  program  has  achieved  thus  far  and  your  support  is
needed as we engage the tasks ahead.

I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  KEVIN  M.  KOLEVAR,  DIRECTOR  OF  THE
OFFICE  OF  ELECTRICITY  DELIVERY  AND  ENERGY  RELI-
ABILITY, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, WASHINGTON, DC
Mr. KOLEVAR. Thank you Chairman Biggert and Members of the
Subcommittee  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on  the  science
and  technology  priorities  for  fiscal  year  2006  within  the  newly-es-
tablished Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.

The Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability resulted
from the consolidation of several programs within the Department.
Consistent  with  the  Appropriations  Act  of  2005,  DOE’s  Energy  Se-
curity  and  Assurance  program  has  been  merged  with  those  of  the
former  Office  of  Electric  Transmission  and  Distribution.  In  addi-
tion, the Import/Export Authorization electricity activity previously
administered  by  the  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  is  now  housed  in  this
new office.

Our  mission  is  to  lead  national  efforts  to  modernize  the  elec-
tricity  delivery  system,  enhance  the  security  and  reliability  of
America’s  energy  infrastructure,  and  facilitate  recovery  from  dis-
ruptions  to  energy  supply.  This  is  vital  to  the  Department’s  stra-
tegic  goal  to  protect  our  national  and  economic  security  by  pro-
moting  a  diverse  supply  and  ensuring  delivery  of  reliable  and  af-
fordable energy.

The  Research  and  Development  program  is  intended  to  con-
tribute to the modernization of the electricity system. It consists of
six  main  activities  that  are  continuing  from  2005:  high-tempera-
ture  superconductivity,  transmission  reliability,  electric  distribu-
tion transformation, energy storage, GridWise, and GridWorks.

The  High-Temperature  Superconductivity  program  supports  de-
velopment of second-generation wire that is useable in cables, gen-
erators, transformers, and motors: equipment that crosscuts the en-
tire  electric  power  value  chain.  High-temperature  superconductors
are  a  good  example  of  advanced  materials  that  have  the  potential
to  transform  electric  power  delivery  in  America.  The  prospect  of
transmitting large amounts of power through compact underground
corridors  with  minimal  electrical  losses  over  long  distances  could
significantly enhance the overall energy efficiency and reliability of
the energy system.

The  transmission  reliability  R&D  activity  supports  moderniza-
tion  of  the  Nation’s  transmission  infrastructure  through  tech-
nologies  that  provide  enhanced  grid  reliability  and  efficient  elec-
tricity markets on our competition. The transmission reliability ac-
tivity  focuses  on  developing  real-time  monitoring  and  control  soft-
ware  tools  and  system  operating  models  for  grid  operators  that  I
would  be  happy  to  expound  on  in  the  question  and  answer  period,
if necessary.

The  electric  distribution  R&D  activity  supports  R&D  that  will
enable  the  development  and  testing  of  advanced  technologies  and
standards for interconnection of distributed energy resources to the
electricity  grid.  The  technology  will  foster  the  full  integration  of
distributed  resources  into  distribution  operations  and  lead  to  in-
creased asset utilization and enhanced system reliability for the en-
tire national electrical system.

The  energy  storage  R&D  includes  research  in  advanced  energy
storage devices for applications ranging from power quality for dig-

ital  facilities  to  voltage  support  for  transmission  lines.  The  energy
storage  activity  emphasizes  buffering  technologies  and  the  design
of  storage  systems  with  integrated  power  electronics  and  controls
that are dedicated to improving the reliability of the grid.

GridWise denotes a modernized electric infrastructure framework
where  open  but  secure  communication  and  information  tech-
nologies  are  used  throughout  the  grid  to  enhance  reliability  and
robustness  and  promote  economic  efficiencies.  The  GridWise  activ-
ity, which is software-centric, comprises the intelligence, or brains,
behind  a  modern  electric  grid  that  incorporates  GridWorks,  which
is hardware-centric technology.

The  GridWorks  activity  focuses  on  advanced  equipment  applica-
tion  and  is  designed  to  accelerate  the  development  and  testing  of
advanced  conductors,  which  can  increase  much-needed  trans-
mission  line  capacity.  GridWorks  pursues  advanced  power  elec-
tronic  breakthroughs  to  develop  new  transformers,  breakers,  and
current  limiters  to  provide  faster  means  of  limiting  transmission
problems before they propagate through the electric system.

The  electricity-restructuring  program  within  this  new  office  pro-
vides  technical  assistance  and  analytical  support  to  states  and  re-
gions  to  facilitate  competitive  and  reliable  wholesale  and  retail
electric  markets.  This  program  includes  modeling  and  analysis  to
identify  the  causes  of  reliability  events  and  recommendations  for
avoiding such future events.

The electricity restructuring program also includes activities for-
merly assigned to the Office of Energy Assurance, namely working
with stakeholders to bolster the security of the Nation’s critical en-
ergy  infrastructure,  and  this  program  is  responsible  for  coordi-
nating  and  carrying  out  the  Department’s  obligations  to  support
the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  in  this  important  national
effort.

Madame  Chairman,  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify
today.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  to  make  progress  in
these critical areas. And I am happy to answer any questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Kolevar follows:]

OFFICE OF ELECTRICITY DELIVERY AND ENERGY

RELIABILITY

OVERVIEW

Chairman  Biggert  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  oppor-
tunity  to  testify  today  on  the  science  and  technology  priorities  for  Fiscal  Year  (FY)
2006  within  the  newly  established  Office  of  Electricity  Delivery  and  Energy  Reli-
ability.

The Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, referred to as the Office
of  Electric  Transmission  and  Distribution  (OETD)  within  the  FY  2006  budget  re-
quest,  resulted  from  the  consolidation  of  several  programs  within  the  Department.
Consistent  with  the  Conference  Report  to  the  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act  of
2005,  the  Energy  Security  and  Assurance  Program  activities  were  merged  with
those of OETD. In addition, the Import/Export Authorization (IEA) electricity activ-
ity was transferred from the Department’s Office of Fossil Energy under the Interior
and Related Agencies Appropriation to OETD under the Energy and Water Develop-
ment Appropriation.

The mission of the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) is to
lead national efforts to modernize the electricity delivery system, to enhance the se-
curity  and  reliability  of  America’s  energy  infrastructure,  and  to  facilitate  recovery

from  disruptions  to  energy  supply.  This  is  vital  to  the  Department’s  strategic  goal
to protect our national and economic security by promoting a diverse supply and de-
livery of reliable, affordable, and environmentally sound energy.

The Administration has requested $95.6 million for OE in FY 2006. This includes
$71.8 million for research and development activities, $12.4 million for electricity re-
structuring  activities,  and  $11.4  million  for  Program  Direction  funds  to  provide  for
programmatic management and to enable the Department to execute its sector-spe-
cific  responsibilities  under  Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive  (HSPD)  7—
‘‘Critical  Infrastructure  Identification,  Prioritization,  and  Protection’’  and  its  emer-
gency  support  responsibilities  as  mandated  by  HSPD  8—‘‘National  Preparedness.’’
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Research and Development (R&D) program within OE, which will contribute
to  the  modernization  of  the  electricity  system,  consists  of  six  main  activities  that
are  continuing  from  FY  2005:  High  Temperature  Superconductivity;  Transmission
Reliability;  Electric  Distribution  Transformation;  Energy  Storage;  GridWise;  and
GridWorks.

The High Temperature Superconductivity activity supports development of second
generation  wire  that  is  usable  in  cables,  generators,  transformers,  and  motors—
equipment  that  crosscuts  the  entire  electric  power  value  chain.  High  temperature
superconductors  are  a  good  example  of  advanced  materials  that  have  the  potential
to  transform  electric  power  delivery  in  America.  The  prospect  of  transmitting  large
amounts  of  power  through  compact  underground  corridors,  with  minimal  electrical
losses  over  long  distances,  could  significantly  enhance  the  overall  energy  efficiency
and reliability of the electric system. In addition, high temperature superconductors
have  the  potential  for  revolutionizing  a  variety  of  military  propulsion  and  directed
energy  weapon  applications  where  high  power  density,  as  well  as  reduced  size  and
weight at reasonable cost, is absolutely essential.

The Transmission Reliability R&D activity supports modernization of the Nation’s
transmission  infrastructure  through  technologies  that  provide  enhanced  grid  reli-
ability  and  efficient  electricity  markets  under  competition.  The  Transmission  Reli-
ability activity focuses on developing real-time monitoring and control software tools
and system operating models for grid operators, and market design research, includ-
ing demand response integration, to support restructured markets development. An
example of this ongoing effort is the Eastern Interconnection Phasor Project (EIPP).
The  EIPP  is  a  network  of  time-synchronized  data  recording  instruments  that  mon-
itor  the  equivalent  of  the  grid’s  heartbeat  and  blood  pressure  in  near  real-time.  It
provides early warning about possible disturbances, while they are still manageable.
The  Electric  Distribution  R&D  activity  supports  R&D  that  will  enable  the  devel-
opment  and  testing  of  advanced  technologies  and  standards  for  interconnection  of
distributed energy resources into the electricity grid. This technology will allow the
full  integration  of  distributed  resources  into  distribution  operations,  and  lead  to  in-
creased asset utilization and enhanced system reliability for the entire national elec-
trical system.

The  Energy  Storage  R&D  activity  includes  research  in  advanced  energy  storage
devices  for  applications  ranging  from  power  quality  for  digital  facilities  to  voltage
support  for  transmission  lines.  The  Energy  Storage  activity  emphasizes  the  design
of storage systems with integrated power electronics and controls that are dedicated
to  improving  the  reliability  of  the  grid,  including  mitigation  of  grid  congestion  and
increasing grid stability by reducing the incidence of power quality disturbances.

GridWise denotes a modernized electric infrastructure framework where open, but
secure,  communication  and  information  technologies,  and  associated  standards  and
protocols,  are  used  throughout  the  electric  grid  to  enhance  reliability  and
robustness,  promote  economic  efficiencies,  and  provide  value  and  choices  to  elec-
tricity  consumers.  The  GridWise  activity  (software-centric)  comprises  the  intel-
ligence—or  brains—behind  a  modern  electric  grid  that  incorporates  GridWorks
(hardware-centric) technology.

The  GridWorks  activity  focuses  on  advanced  equipment  applications.  GridWorks
uses the facilities at DOE’s national laboratories to accelerate the development and
testing  of  advanced  conductors,  which  can  increase  much  needed  transmission  line
capacity.  It  complements  GridWise’s  architectural  software  development  by  devel-
oping and demonstrating associated hardware, such as sensors. GridWorks pursues
advanced  power  electronic  breakthroughs  to  develop  new  transformers,  breakers,
and  current  limiters,  to  provide  faster  means  of  limiting  transmission  problems  be-
fore they propagate through the electric system.

ELECTRICITY RESTRUCTURING

The  Electricity  Restructuring  program  provides  technical  assistance  and  analyt-
ical  support  to  States  and  regions  for  policies,  market  mechanisms,  and  activities
that facilitate competitive, reliable, environmentally sensitive, and customer-friendly
wholesale and retail electric markets. This program includes modeling and analysis
to  identify  the  causes  of  reliability  events,  and  development  and  implementation  of
policy-related recommendations for avoiding such future events.

The  Electricity  Restructuring  program  also  includes  activities  formerly  assigned
to  the  Office  of  Energy  Assurance.  The  President  has  designated  the  Department
of Energy as the Lead Sector-Specific Agency responsible for protecting the Nation’s
critical  energy  infrastructure,  and  this  program  is  responsible  for  coordinating  and
carrying  out  the  Department’s  obligations  to  support  the  Department  of  Homeland
Security in this important national initiative.
MOVING RESEARCH INTO THE MARKETPLACE

I  would  like  to  turn  now  to  discuss  moving  the  research  into  the  marketplace.
There are several barriers to the acceptance of new electricity transmission and dis-
tribution technologies. These include the capital intensive nature of grid assets, the
long  life-span  of  transmission  infrastructure  which  results  in  a  slow  turnover  proc-
ess, utility reluctance to invest in new technologies until their durability is ensured,
hesitation  to  make  investments  until  the  future  structure  of  the  electricity  sector
is known, difficulties in siting new infrastructure, and permitting delays.

While  DOE  conducts  research,  development,  field  testing,  and  demonstration  of
technologies  that  will  facilitate  modernization  of  the  grid,  as  well  as  identifies  and
addresses public policy issues that impact grid modernization, the private sector (as
well  as  public  power)  must  make  the  necessary  infrastructure  investments  to  actu-
ally modernize the grid. It is a complicated process that will require unprecedented
levels  of  cooperation  among  the  electric  power  industry’s  diverse  stakeholders.  The
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has recently taken action on a case-by-case
basis to authorize transmission rate incentives that can provide greater certainty to
investors  and  thus  encourage  quicker,  appropriate  investments  in  grid  improve-
ment.

OE  has  made  progress  as  well—pursuing  dialogue  with  industry,  shaping  a
shared  vision  of  the  future,  and  identifying  a  pathway  to  get  us  there.  The  Office
is  working  with  State  commissions  to  familiarize  them  with  the  new  grid  tech-
nologies  and  the  extent  to  which  their  reliability  has  been  demonstrated.  Although
DOE has made progress, much more progress needs to be made.

Modernization  of  our  aging  energy  infrastructure  will  help  reduce  the  risk  of
large-scale  blackouts  and  minimize  transmission  bottlenecks.  The  Administration
commends  the  House  for  again  passing  energy  legislation  which  includes  an  elec-
tricity  title  that  will  achieve  many  of  the  Administration’s  policy  objectives  to  im-
prove reliability, protect consumers, increase supply, and promote efficient markets.
Although  I  only  identified  a  few  key  projects,  there  are  many  beneficial  tech-
nologies that are ready to be deployed. But what is lacking is industry certainty on
what a ‘‘restructured’’ electricity sector will look like in the future. This can be over-
come by repealing outdated rules that discourage investment in new infrastructure,
as  the  recently  passed  energy  bill  will  do,  and  by  encouraging  the  development  of
new technologies to make the grid more efficient, reliable, and secure.

I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today.  I  look  forward  to  working  with
you  to  make  progress  in  these  critical  areas.  Madam  Chairman,  this  concludes  my
testimony  and  I  would  be  happy  to  respond  to  any  questions  from  the  Committee.

BIOGRAPHY FOR KEVIN M. KOLEVAR

Kevin Kolevar is Director of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) newly established

Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.

The  new  office  develops  and  helps  implement  national  policy  pertaining  to  elec-
tricity  transmission  and  distribution,  electric  grid  reliability,  and  electric  grid  tech-
nology  research  and  development.  It  also  leads  federal  efforts  to  help  ensure  and
secure  the  reliable  flow  of  energy  to  homes,  industry,  public  service  facilities  and
the transportation system.

Before  taking  this  position,  Kolevar  served  as  Chief  of  Staff  to  Deputy  Secretary
of  Energy  Kyle  McSlarrow  from  January,  2003  to  January,  2005.  In  that  position,
he supported and advised the Secretary and Deputy Secretary on policy, regulatory,
and  legislative  matters  as  well  as  Departmental  program  management.  Prior  to
serving as Chief of Staff to the Deputy Secretary, Kolevar worked as a Senior Policy
Advisor to the Secretary of Energy on security and technology issues.

Mr.  Kolevar  is  the  former  Chair  of  the  Department  of  Energy  National  Security
Working Group and was a senior advisor to the U.S.-Canada Task Force that inves-
tigated the 2003 blackout. Before coming to DOE, Kolevar spent over 10 years work-
ing in the Senate on the staffs of Senators Spencer Abraham (R–Mich.) and Connie
Mack (R–Fla.).

DISCUSSION

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Kolevar.
And  now  it  is  our  turn  to  ask  the  questions,  which  we  limit  to

five minutes, also.

And  so  my  first  question  would  be  for  Mr.  Johnson,  Mr.  Faulk-
ner, Mr. Kolevar, and Mr. Maddox, unless somebody else finds that
they really have to answer it, also.

The  Department  has  often  said  that  the  appropriate  role  of  fed-
eral funding of research is for high-risk activities with a potentially
high payoff and demonstration projects that are both a useful step
in  developing  technologies  and  a  means  to  stimulate  commer-
cialization of mature technologies but are generally lower risk than
other  activities  that  might  be  undertaken.  And  recently,  the  De-
partment  has  characterized  some  major  projects  as  ‘‘learning  dem-
onstrations’’  and  so  they  are  necessary  to  understand  the  chal-
lenges  facing  new  technologies.  What  are  the—in  your  opinion,
what  are  the  criteria  the  Department  uses  to  graduate  activities
from the laboratory to the demonstration phase? And what are the
characteristics  that  distinguish  a  learning  demonstration  from  a
technical demonstration?

Who would like to start with that?
Mr. Faulkner, you look ready.
Mr. FAULKNER. I am trying not to look ready.
Several  questions  are  embedded  there.  Let  me  make  several
points. One of them is my office has a range of technologies. I think
we  have  a  diverse  portfolio.  We  look  at  a  lot  of  things  in  deter-
mining our budget. We look at national priorities. We look at where
the  technologies  are  in  the  marketplace.  Are  private  sector  compa-
nies  spending  more  money  over  time?  We  look  at  where  our  part-
ners  are  spending  money  in  the  Federal  Government.  We  think
that we have a good balance in our portfolio between research and
development  and  demonstration  technologies.  We  do  a  lot  of  anal-
ysis,  like  when  we  do  our  budget  formulation  in  the  spring.  We
look  at  a  lot  of  these  things:  priorities,  risk.  What  are  the  benefits
of  these  technologies?  Where  do  they  stand?  And  so  it  is  kind  of
a  balance  that  you  have  to  get  to  in  terms  of—it  is  almost  like  a
3–D chess game in terms of determining where you put your money
on what technologies.

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  Is  there  a  difference  between  what  we
would  call  learning  demonstrations  and  those  that  are  just  dem-
onstration projects?

Mr.  FAULKNER.  Well,  in  the  hydrogen  program,  which  you  may
be  referring  to,  they  have  learning  demonstrations,  and  they  con-
sider there is a difference between that and deployment demonstra-
tions. They think that these learning demonstrations are an exten-
sion  of  the  marketplace.  We  are  trying  to  get  data  to  help  us  do
our research better. And a pre-commercialization deployment dem-
onstration  test  the  market  and  large  volumes  are  created  to  try

67

and  see  how  the  technologies  are  adapting,  how  the  production
costs  are—whether  you  can  reduce  the  production  costs.  And  I
think  in  the  hydrogen  program,  we  think  the  learning  demonstra-
tion is just right, right now, because the marketplace is pretty im-
mature for more—the other kind of demonstration projects.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Okay. Thank you.
Mr. Maddox.
Mr.  MADDOX.  Thank  you.  I  will  try  to  remember  all  of  these

questions. I tried to take notes as we went through here.

Very  quickly,  our  balance  is  driven,  and  our  portfolio,  is  driven
by a couple different drivers. One of them is our larger policy driv-
er,  which  is  essentially  to  take  our  most  abundant  resource,  coal,
and allow it to be burned cleanly.

A second driver is what we see called regulatory drivers. For in-
stance,  the  mercury  regulations  have  been  out  there  for  a  while,
and  so  we  have  been  putting  a  large  amount  of  resources  into  try-
ing  to  create  a  mercury  technology  that  can  remove  mercury.  So
that is a real driver as things come forward on the regulatory front.
This  Administration  had  a  very  strong  policy,  you  can’t  create
regulations  unless  there  is  underlying  technology  to  support  meet-
ing  those  regulations.  So  for  instance,  if  we  want  to  limit  mercury
to 90 percent, we have got to find a way to limit mercury and cap-
ture that emissions. So that is the issue on that.

In  determining  demonstration  projects,  usually  that  is  coming
post-pilot  phase,  which  we  consider  the—more  the  R&D  phase
where  we  feel  we  have  reasonable  confidence  that  a  project  may
work  at  a  large  scale.  For  us,  that  is  electricity  production  usually
in the 275 and up range. And that is also limiting. A good example
of that is our IGCC plant outside Tampa, where it initially started,
I  think,  with  30  percent  reliability  and  after  eight  years  of  tweak-
ing  it,  learning  how  it  works,  we  have  now  got  a  stable  operation
that  is  actually  available  in  the  80-plus  percentage  time.  It  is  now
commercially  dispatching  energy  and  is  no  longer  a  demonstration
project. It graduated to commercial.

So that is, in a nutshell, how our process works. All of our dem-

onstrations are a combination of technical and learning.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. All right. Thank you.
Mr. Johnson.
Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you, Madame Chairman.
I would characterize the Office of Nuclear Energy’s research and
development programs as being planned through, essentially, three
phases:  a  laboratory  demonstration,  a  pilot-scale  demonstration,
and  then  eventually  bearing  merit,  an  engineering-scale  dem-
onstration.

Given  the  nature  of  our  work,  we  are,  in  all  of  our  R&D  pro-
grams in the Office of Nuclear Energy, still on the laboratory scale,
whether it is in our advanced fuel cycle looking at spin fuel separa-
tion  technologies  or  in  our  nuclear  hydrogen  initiative  looking  at
the  various  chemical  processes  for  splitting  water  into  hydrogen
and oxygen. We are clearly still at the laboratory scale, and we will
remain  there  until  such  time  as  the  technology  proves  to  be  suffi-
ciently  mature  to  move  on  to  a  larger  scale  operation.  And  the  ap-
proach  we  take  is  to  ensure  that  we  have  a  good  understanding  of
the  science  and  engineering  on  a  laboratory  scale  before  making

the  investments  to  move  up  into  a  larger  scale  facility.  For  exam-
ple, our nuclear hydrogen program is looking at thermochemical re-
actions.  Currently  in  the  laboratory,  that  is  characterized  as  on  a
watt  scale.  Our  plans  to  scale  that  up  into  pilot  would  be  on  the
kilowatt  range,  and  then  an  engineering  scale  would  take  us  into
a  megawatt  range  for  the  hydrogen  production.  So  what  we  have
is  a  graduated  program  with  clear  delineation  between  the  phases
of the R&D and, hopefully in the not-too-distant future, we will be
able to move from the laboratory scale into the pilot scale activities.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
And Mr. Kolevar.
Mr. KOLEVAR. Madame Chairman, I think, because of the nature
of our office, we are a little different than—from our sister applied
R&D programs in that the technologies that we are working to de-
velop  and  get  into  the  system  are  kind  of  going  into  the  middle  of
an  up  and  running  system.  They  are  not  an  end  use  connection,  if
you  will.  So  to  the  extent  that  there  is  a  difference  between,  with
respect to criteria, learning versus technical, I guess we would have
to focus more on the technical side, and it is because of the nature
of the challenges that we face in pursuing and working with indus-
try and the states to get the technology into the system.

We understand—typically, going in, and while we do demo these
things  across  the  lab  complex,  we  understand,  fairly  well  going  in,
the  specifications,  and  we  have  a  pretty  good  idea  of  the  effective-
ness  of  a  lot  of  the  technologies  that  we  demonstrate.  We  have  a
good  sense  of  what  we  are  going  to  get  after  all  of  the  time  that
we  have  spent  in  the  lab  application.  What  is  particularly  difficult
is  working  with  industry  to  convince  them,  and  to  get  the  nec-
essary  information  to  ensure  that  we  have  conforming  standards
and protocols for connectivity in getting new software into the sys-
tem  or  hardware  into  the  system  and  to  prove  beyond  a  doubt  to
a  utility  that  this  technology  will  work  and  it  will  not  cause  some
kind of system failure that they pay for, that they are targeted for,
because  the  reliability  suffers  and  the  consumers  come  back  to
them.  I  mean,  this  is  an  up  and  time—real-time  up  and  running
system  that  has  to  maintain  24/7  operations.  And  so  it  is  typically
a  delicate  balancing  act,  and  that  is  the  challenge  we  face  is  to
really convince them that this technology will work, that their reli-
ability  will  improve  as  a  result  of  it,  and  not  suffer  during  a  dem-
onstration on the system itself.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
My time has expired.
And  I  would  recognize  the  gentlewoman  from  California,  Ms.

Woolsey, for five minutes.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Madame Chairman.
First I would like to ask unanimous consent to enter my opening

remarks into the record.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Without objection.
Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you very much.
I  am  sorry.  I  missed  most  of  your  testimony.  I  know  you  were

wonderful, every—each and every one of you.

My goal is that this country of ours becomes the globe—globally,
actually,  becomes  independent  of  fossil  fuels  as  soon  as  possible,
and  I  believe  we  can  do  that  by  investing  in  clean,  renewable  en-

ergy sources, creating incentives for conservation and efficiency and
new  technologies,  and  in  other  words,  invest  in  the  future.  So  just
know  that  when  I  am  asking  you  my  questions.  That  is  where  I
come from.

I  represent  Marin  and  Sonoma  Counties,  the  two  counties  just
north of San Francisco across the Golden Gate Bridge, which could
give  you  a  little  bit  of  an  idea  of  my  constituency.  We  are  very
green. We are looking to the future, and we think we can be doing
things a little differently than we are.

My  first  question  today  is  for  you,  Dr.  Orbach.  I  was  interested
in what the Committee has recently been aware of planning within
the  Office  of  Science,  focusing  on  new  directions  for  harnessing
solar energies and solar power and converting it into solar to chem-
ical  with  carbon-neutral  fuel.  What  are  you  doing  with  that?  How
far  are  you  with  it?  What  kind  of  support  are  you  getting  from  us
and  from  the  Administration?  And  what  else  do  you  need  to  make
it go forward?

Dr. ORBACH. Thank you, Congresswoman Woolsey.
We  have  just  finished  a  major  workshop  on  solar  energy  where,
as you have outlined, we have looked at those three areas of oppor-
tunity.  What  has  changed  has  been  the  advent  of  nanotechnology
and  our  ability  to,  within  a  given  substance,  understand  how  light
is absorbed, solar light, and also how to separate charges, which is
what  nature  does  when  it  does  photosynthesis.  But  we  now  think
we  know  how  to  do  that  artificially.  And  so  we  have  put  a  work-
shop  together  to  give  us  guidance  and  future  directions  for  solar
energy  that,  hopefully,  will  open  up  new  avenues  and  greater  effi-
ciencies and opportunities for us.

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Well,  tell  me  what  you  mean.  Who  is  at  that
workshop, and what kind of incentives do those folks need that are
at the workshop to carry out this—these future steps?

Dr.  ORBACH.  Well,  we  will  be  providing  research  support  to  the
workshop  members.  There  were  over  200  members,  I  should  say
attendees,  at  the  workshop.  We  originally  planned,  by  invitation
only,  to  have  70,  but  we  just  couldn’t  say  no.  They  were,  very
roughly  speaking,  about  half  from  universities,  about  a  third  from
national laboratories, and I know it is not going to add up, another
third, roughly, from industry.
Ms. WOOLSEY. An overlap.
Dr.  ORBACH.  And  the—so  it  was  a  very  broad  spectrum.  And
here,  actually,  we  work  very  closely  with  energy  efficiency  and  re-
newable energy. The opening speaker was from our NREL facility,
which  is  an  EERE  facility,  who  laid  out  what  the  research  issues
were. And then the focus of the workshop was to look at the near-
term,  what  I  will  call,  roadblocks  to  harnessing  solar  energy  that
were  identified  by  EERE  and  then  to  take  a  look  at  some  of  the
longer-term.  Basically,  plants  are  relatively  efficient  in  terms  of
each  photon  absorbed,  but  they  are  inefficient  in  terms  of  taking
advantage  of  the  energy  that  they  receive.  And  what  we  want  to
do is to use artificial structures, some of them mimicking biological
structures, in order to make that whole process more efficient.

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  So  I  mean,  I  don’t  think  we  have  a  lot  of  time  to

dilly-dally on this, so what do you need from us to——

Dr. ORBACH. Well, we are currently exploring——

Ms. WOOLSEY.—make people——
Dr.  ORBACH.  We  are  currently  exploring  opportunities  here—by

the way, not just in solar.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Oh, wind?
Dr. ORBACH. We are also looking at hydrogen. We are looking at
new materials. We are looking at a panoply of opportunities that—
biomass  is  another  one,  that  would  assist  energy  independence,  as
you  have  outlined  it.  And  we  are  putting  together  a  research  pro-
gram  in  each  of  those  areas.  Hydrogen,  for  example,  has  already
matured.  We  had  800  preproposals.  We  will  be  making  about  70
grants next month for hydrogen research to do as I was describing
before. So we are building this into our core research program and
look forward to your support as we develop the specifics.

Ms. WOOLSEY. All right. Well, I look forward to working with you
in  getting  language  in  legislation  that  will  actually  focus  on  what
you are doing.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
The  gentleman  from  Texas,  Mr.  Hall,  is  recognized  for  five  min-

utes.

Mr.  HALL.  I  yield  to  the  gentleman  who  was  here  before  I  got

here, Madame Chairman, Mr. Schwarz—Dr. Schwarz.

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  The  gentleman  from  Michigan  is  recog-
nized  for  five  minutes.  I  believe  you  were  at  the—listening  to  the
testimony, but that is all right if you want to yield.

Dr.  SCHWARZ.  My  questions  are  pretty  elemental,  but  they  are

the questions that the folks at home are asking.

Nuclear  power  transmission  technology,  at  least  in  the  minds  of
the  public,  is  relatively  advanced,  if  we  look  especially  at  Western
Europe and maybe even more especially at France. Can you tell me
when you think there will be a new nuclear power-generating plant
built in the United States and what impediments, if I am the CEO
of  Consumer’s  Power  or  DTE  or  ConEd,  what  impediments  are  in
front of me in doing so, even knowing that I have to do it at some
point in the future, sooner rather than later?

And  whomever  wants  to  address  that,  please  feel  free  to  do  so.
Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir.
With respect to the decision to pursue a new nuclear power plant
construction  project  in  this  country,  as  you  know,  that  is  clearly  a
decision of industry. What the Department is doing through its nu-
clear power 2010 program is partnering with industry to prove out
the untested regulatory process at the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion  for  the  identification  of  reactor  technologies,  the  identification
of  new  sites  onto  which  to  build,  and  then  finally  the  issuance  of
what is called the combined construction operating license.

We recently announced the awards of two partnerships with two
industry-led teams. The preliminary plans that those two consortia
have  is  that  they  are  looking  to  submit  the  combined  construction
and operating license application to the NRC for its review and ap-
proval in the 2007 to 2008 time frame. The review process then at
the  NRC  will  take  two  to  three  years.  I  believe  the  preliminary
schedules  have—the  decisions  could  be  made  by  industry  on  mov-
ing  forward  with  new  nuclear  generation,  a  plant  order,  in  the
2009 to 2010 time frame.

Dr.  SCHWARZ.  Is  there—I  am  sorry.  If  somebody  else  wanted  to
jump  in,  okay,  but  I  have  a  couple  more  minutes,  and  I  wanted  to
ask another question.

Is  there  a  consensus  in  the  energy  research  community  and  the
commercial  power-generating  community  that  we  have  to  go  back
to  nuclear?  That  in  the  continuation  of  building  and  refining  coal-
fired  plants,  some  natural  gas-fired  plants,  there  is  a  hard  stop
there someplace where we can’t continue to build those plants that
put out the fluvia that they put out, and we have to go to nuclear?
It  is  a  message  that  I  think  people  need  to  learn  and  that  people
have  to  understand  that  at  some  point,  the  alternative,  the  clean
power  we  are  looking  for  is,  in  fact,  nuclear  power,  back  to  the  fu-
ture, so to speak? Would anyone want to comment on that—on my
comment?

Mr.  JOHNSON.  I  would  only  add  that  the  Department  is  sup-
portive of a mixed energy production portfolio, not putting all of its
eggs in the traditional basket of a single technology. So we envision
that  there  is  a  role  for  nuclear,  clean  coal,  solar,  and  the  other  re-
newables  that  it  is  part  and  parcel  of  a  diversified  energy  produc-
tion mix.

Mr.  MADDOX.  I  might  add  too,  that,  you  know,  one  of  the  things
we  have  studied  and  looked  at  is  our  growing  need  for  energy  in
the future and that there is an expectation that for us to maintain
our  economic  growth  and  the  energy  to  fuel  that,  we  are  looking
at  probably  about  40  percent  more  energy  over  the  next  20  years.
This  means  that  we  really  don’t  have  the  option  of  taking  any  en-
ergy  source  off  the  table  and  that  we  need  more  of  everything,  in-
cluding more conservation.

We  also  are  very  sensitive  to  the  fact  that  we  need  to  make  it
cleaner.  This  Administration  has  virtually  doubled  the  amount  of
money  we  are  putting  into  clean  coal  research.  We  lead  the  world
in our FutureGen project. I think everyone understands two things:
we  need  more  energy,  and  we  need  to  make  it  cleaner.  And  our
ability  to  simply  discard  any  energy  source  is  not  a  practical  re-
sponse.

Dr. SCHWARZ. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. BARTLETT. [Presiding.] Thank you very much.
And the staff tells me that I am next in the cue.
Thank you all very much for your testimony.
A couple of weeks ago, I was at a breakfast, and a heritage fellow
was speaking there. It was Peter Brooks, and he was talking in ec-
onomics,  and  he  made  the  statement  that  every  country  in  the
world  that  pumped  oil  had  maxed  out,  except  Saudi  Arabia.  Just
as  I  was  walking  over  here,  the  elevator  was  full,  so  I  walked
across  the  street  with  Don  Young,  the  Chairman  of  the  Transpor-
tation Committee, and he was commenting on the President’s visit
yesterday  with  the  gentlemen  from  Saudi  Arabia  and—who  said
that  they  weren’t  going  to  increase  oil  production.  And  I  offer  the
maybe  the  correct  answer  would  have  been,  ‘‘Gee,  Mr.  President,
we can’t increase oil production.’’ And Chairman Young agrees that
that is probably true.

Do you think that these two people are wrong?

Nobody  has  volunteered  that  they  are  certain  they  are  wrong.
You all know, of course, of M. King Hubbard, a scientist of 60 years
ago,  who  observed  during  the  1940s  and  the  1950s  that  an  indi-
vidual oil field was exploited on a bell curve, rapidly rising produc-
tion  during  the  early  pumping  and  then  reaching  a  peak  at  which
about half of the field had been pumped, and then sliding down the
other  side.  He  theorized,  as  you  know,  that  if  you  added  up  all  of
the little bell curves from the fields in the United States, you could
predict  when  the  United  States  would  peak  in  oil  production.  He
made  that  prediction  in  1956,  and  he  was  right  on  target.  He  said
it  would  be  about  1970.  It  was  exactly  1970  that  we  peaked  in  oil
production.

We  are  now  producing  about  half  of  the  oil  that  we  produced  in

1970, as you know. We are sliding down Hubbard’s peak.

In  1973,  he  did  this  analysis  for  the  world,  and  he  thought  that
the  world  would  peak  in  oil  production  about  2000.  He  missed  it
a  little,  because  he  couldn’t  have  known  of  the  Arab  Oil  Embargo,
which occurred later. He couldn’t have known of the oil price spikes
and of the worldwide recession, which delayed it. There are a num-
ber of observers who believe that we are now at peak oil.

What  that  means  is  that  although  world  demand  for  oil  is  going
up exponentially, not on a straight line the way your energy infor-
mation  agency  depicts  it,  it  is  going  up  exponentially.  And  last
year,  China  increased  their  use  of  oil  about  maybe  as  much  as  25
percent.  The  world’s  economy  grew  at  10  percent  last  year.  Our—
I  am  sorry,  five  percent  last  year.  Our  economy  grew  at  probably
half of that last year. The third world is now wanting more oil, and
they are using it very inefficiently. One of the best things we could
do is to help them use energy efficiently.

While  we  are  having  greatly  increased  demands  for  oil,  the  pro-
duction of oil will level off for a while, and then it will start sliding
down  Hubbard’s  peak,  no  matter  what  we  do.  One  author,  when
writing  about  this,  and  don’t  throw  his  document  down  when  you
read  it.  I  had  a—was  going  to  do  that,  but  I  read  on,  and  it  was
hard to argue with his conclusion. ‘‘Dear readers: civilization, as we
know it, is coming to an end soon. This is not the wacky proclama-
tion  of  a  doomsday  cult,  apocalypse  bible  prophecy  sector,  con-
spiracy  theory  society.  Rather,  it  is  a  scientific  conclusion  of  the
best  paid,  most  widely  respected  geologists,  physicists,  and  invest-
ment  bankers  in  the  world.  These  are  rational,  professional,  con-
servative  individuals,  who  are  absolutely  terrified  by  phenomenon
known as global peak oil.’’ I, too, am concerned. Tell me that he is
an idiot and I shouldn’t be concerned.

Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, do you want it in that order?
Mr. BARTLETT. No. I have talked to a lot of people. I gave a one-
hour  speech,  a  special  order  on  the  Floor  of  the  House,  about  six
weeks  ago,  and  I  have  had  a  stream  of  people  through  my  office
and  calls  from  all  over  the  world,  and  I  know  of  nobody  out  there
who  doesn’t  believe  that  we  are  either  at  peak  oil  or  will  shortly
be  at  peak  oil.  By  the  way,  if  you  look  at  the  curves,  at  the  bell
curve,  Hubbard’s  curve  for  the  world,  and  if  you  look  at  the  use
curve,  you  don’t  have  to  be  at  peak  oil  to  have  a  problem,  because
you start deviating from that bell curve a bit before you get to the
peak. So peak oil may be a bit in the future. But if the world can’t

meet  its  demands—there  are  two  things  that  we  can  not  argue
with.  Hubbard  was  right  about  the  United  States,  and  we  have
known  he  was  right  for  at  least  25  years;  and  we  in  the  United
States and we in the world have done nothing, zilch, while this tsu-
nami  was  approaching.  And  the  other  thing,  which  is  undeniable,
is that today oil is over $50 a barrel. I was talking with John Din-
gell, who has a broader, longer vision of this than anybody else. He
has been in the House 52 years, I think. John says, ‘‘You will never
see $50 a barrel oil again.’’ Goldman Sacks says it is going to $105
and  Americans  won’t  change  their  driving  habits  until  gas  is  $4  a
gallon.

What  are  you  doing  in  the  Department  of  Energy  that  is  con-
sistent?  Then  my  five  minutes  is  up.  We  will  come  back.  I  don’t
want  to  take  the  other  people’s  time.  I  want  to  come  back.  I  will
stay  here  to  talk  with  you  after  everybody  else  has—but  I  want  to
know  what  you  are  doing  that  is  consistent  with  the  reality  that
we  are  probably  at  peak  oil.  See,  I  don’t  see  us  doing  anything  as
a  culture.  I  don’t  see  us  doing  anything  as  a  country.  I  don’t  see
us  doing  anything  as  the  Department  of  Energy  that  is  consistent
with this reality.

Let me yield now to the next person in the cue.
Mr. Green.
Mr.  GREEN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  will  pass  at  this  time.  Thank  you.
Mr. BARTLETT. Okay.
Mr. Hall.
Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. And I don’t know if I have
a  different  outlook  that  you  have.  I  think  we  are  pretty  close  to-
gether,  but  we  just  passed  an  energy  bill.  Someone  is  doing  some-
thing  about  it.  This  committee  has  done  something  about  it,  be-
cause  this  committee  had  some  input  into  the  energy  bill,  H.R.  6.
Most  of  you  on  this  committee—some  of  you  voted  against  the  en-
ergy bill every time it has come up. But I think energy is the num-
ber one word in the dictionary, and if had a child that was a junior
or  senior  in  high  school,  I  would  be  thinking  along  the  way  I
thought back in 1941 when Frank Roosevelt said, ‘‘To some genera-
tions,  much  is  given.  Of  some  generations,  much  is  expected.  But
this  generation  has  a  rendezvous  with  destiny.’’  That  rendezvous
was World War II, and for those who are sophomores or juniors or
seniors in high school, like I was in 1941, they have the same ren-
dezvous  if  we  don’t  solve  the  energy  problem.  And  we  have  just
passed  a  bill  that  has  done  something  about  it,  if  the  Senate  will
get  off  of  the  you-know-whats  and  give  us  two  more  votes,  we  will
have a good bill to take to a President that will sign it. And I think
everybody  at  that  table  has  had  some  input  into  that  energy  bill,
because  you  have  been  consulted.  Your  divisions  have  been  con-
sulted.  You  have  worked  with  us.  You  have  disagreed  with  us  and
agreed with us. We have a good Chairman that has been fair with
democrats  and  republicans  alike  as  we  labored  through  that  bill.
And  we  have  fossil  fuels  in  the  bill,  and  I  am  glad  we  have  fossil
fuels  in  the  bill.  I  am  glad  we  have  anything  in  there  that  might
keep  my  grandchildren  from  having  to  fight  a  war.  And  that  is
really  what  the  reward  is  for  solving  the  energy  problem.  It  is  a
shame  that  we  have  to  buy  60  percent  of  our  energy  from  people
who  don’t  like  us,  who  don’t  trust  us,  and  people  we  don’t  trust.

It  is  a  shame  that  we  can’t  drill  ANWR,  19  million  acres  and  tell
me  we  can’t  drill  on  a  couple  or  three  or  four  or  five  thousand  of
it.  It  is  outrageous,  I  think,  if  we  can’t  if  a  generation  is  at  risk.
And that is absolutely what the situation is.

So  we  need  to  clean  up  fossil  fuels,  but  it  is  not  like  the  Kilgore
oil fields 30, 50, 45 years ago. There is a lot of good technology. The
animal  life  in  Alaska  have  not  faltered  standing  in  the  shade  of
some  of  these  oil  derricks  up  there.  We  are  solving  a  problem  that
is a national problem that we have the ability to solve and that we
ought to solve, and that is passing this energy bill.

Now  I  have  a  part  of  the  energy  bill,  and  I  am  for  every  bit  of
that  energy  bill,  everything  that  might  keep  our  kids  from  having
to  cross  an  ocean  and  take  some  energy  away  from  someone.  And
let  me  tell  you,  nations  will  fight  for  energy.  I  don’t  think  there  is
any  question  that  Japan  went  south  into  Malaysia  because  they
had been cut off from their energy. I don’t think there is any ques-
tion that we—the—even went into the oil fields because they spent
theirs  on  mixed  benzene,  non-benzene.  They  were  out  of  fuel.
George  Bush  sent  450,000  youngsters  to  a  desert,  and  to  me,  that
was  for  keeping  a  bad  guy,  Saddam  Hussein,  from  getting  his  foot
on half of the known oil reserves in the world. I think that was an
energy  battle.  Of  course,  they  envision  it  as  liberating  and  giving
freedom. And I respect that, too.

So I have this question. I am concerned about the cuts to oil and
gas  R&D  in  this  year’s  budget  request  at  a  time  when  our  nation
is  experiencing  record  energy  prices  and  threats  from  abroad.  We
need  to  do  more  to  discover  new  technologies  to  use  for  domestic
productions, including fossil fuels and including nuclear and includ-
ing solar. We have touched the base on all of them.

The energy bill that passed the House last week contains my pro-
vision  that  calls  for  mandatory  spending  for  an  ultra-deep  water
and unconventional natural gas production program. This program
is  expected  to  yield  natural  gas  supplies  at  3.8  trillion  cubic  feet
and 850 million barrels of oil. According to the Bureau of Economic
Geology  at  the  University  of  Texas,  this  program  will  yield  a  net
federal  budget  benefits  of  $12  billion  over  10  years.  It  is  going  to
cost $2.1 billion over a period of time, but it is going to yield $12.4
billion  over  10  years  and  lower  the  cost  of  household  natural  gas
bills by $2.2 billion per year by 2015, we are told by a study group.
And  that  study  has  been  accepted  by  republicans  and  democrats.
It has been accepted by the House, and it has been accepted by the
Senate, because it has passed the Conference Committee over there
twice. And it is over there now for them.

So  the  ultra-deep  drilling  is  only  one  promising  program,  and  it
is  complementary  to  the  base  program.  At  this  time,  domestic  oil
and  gas  production  is  declining  and  the  7,000  independent  pro-
ducers  are  producing  about  d  of  our  domestic  oil  and  natural  gas.
So  my  question,  I  guess,  is  why  it  seems  to  me,  and  I  hope  I  am
wrong  because  I  support  the  Administration,  but  why  are  they  de-
termined to terminate programs that primarily benefit independent
producers  who  are  producing  d  of  our  energy?  And  they  used  to
produce  90  percent  of  it,  and  then  the  majors  took  it  over  and
bought it. But that is—I guess the treatment that the independent
producers  are  getting  right  now  is  the  thing  that  surprises  me

more  than  any  other.  Would  any  of  you  care  to  comment  on  that?
Maybe  I  am  wrong.  I  am  not  asking  you  to  call  anybody  an  idiot,
because  I  have  got  my  own  mind  made  up  as  to  who  is  an  idiot.

Mr. MADDOX. Well, thank you for that.
To  somewhat  answer  your  question,  though  I  am  not  certain  it
is,  I  think,  as  you  know,  it  has  been  a  very  tough  budget  year  for
all of us, and we have had to make some really hard decisions. And
I  think  the  President  probably  summed  it  up  best  in  a  statement
last week that with the current price of oil and comparatively well
profits  that  he  strongly  believes,  the  President  strongly  believes,
that  industry  should  step  up  to  the  plate  and  that  there  is  plenty
of incentive for them to do so.

Mr. HALL. Probably my time is up.
Does anybody else have a—any suggestion?
Well,  one,  two,  three,  four,  five.  I  think  four  of  them  must  agree
with me, and the other one is not far off, so I would yield back my
time while I am winning.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
Maybe your question was too tough.
Mr. HALL. Well, maybe it was.
And I yield back my time, Madame Chairman.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
Mr. HALL. Thank you.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. The gentleman yields back.
The  gentleman  from  California,  the  Ranking  Member,  Mr.

Honda, is recognized.

Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Madame Chairwoman.
This is a question for Mr. Faulkner.
Probably  more  than  any  other  program  at  DOE,  the  success  of
your  program  depends  on  getting  taxpayer-funded  technologies  de-
veloped  at  the  labs  into  the  marketplace.  Yet  we  hear  over  and
over  about  the  so-called  Valley  of  Death  where  federal  support  for
commercialization  is  where  technology  ends  but  that  technology
may  not  be  mature  enough  for  the  marketplace.  The  marketplace
is not always the best judge of technological winners and losers.

So I have a four-point question. If—number one is how has it the
Department  improved  this  technology  transfer  efforts.  Is  there  a
central  body  responsible  for  ensuring  potentially  beneficial  tech-
nologies  to  make  it  into  the  marketplace?  If  not,  will  the  Depart-
ment and the country benefit from greater emphasis of bridging the
Valley  of  Death  for  potentially  revolutionary  technologies?  And
then do other agencies’ efforts, such as DARPA in the Department
of Defense, serve as a good model for increased technology develop-
ment  and  deployment?  The  reason  I  ask  is  I  have  got  a  bill  I  am
working on.

Mr.  FAULKNER.  Well, 

let  me  try  to  answer  those 

four

questions——

Mr. HONDA. I appreciate it.
Mr. FAULKNER.—in a comprehensive way.
I  think  it  is  important  to  see  this  as  a  continuum  from  the  first
idea that somebody has to the time a consumer or an industry pur-
chases  or  uses  this  technology.  And  I  think  the  Department,  and
not  just  my  office,  plays  an  important  role  in  several  points  along
that  continuum.  It  is  a  huge  and  complex  process,  as  big  and  as

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:35 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 020735 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\042705\20735 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

76

complicated  as  the  U.S.  economy.  I  think  the  Department,  first  of
all,  does  basic  and  applied  R&D  and  many  times,  at  least  in  my
office,  we  tend  to  do  that  on  merit-based,  competitive  solicitations
where  the  best  ideas  float  to  the  top.  You  do  that  in  partnerships
with  the  private  sector,  cost-shared  partnerships.  So  they  are  put-
ting  money  on  the  table,  and  when  they  do  that,  that  means  they
are  starting  to  pay  attention  to  it,  and  they  will  try  to  take  that
to the marketplace.

I  think  that  these  technologies,  then,  can  be  encouraged  or  pro-
moted by State or federal legislation, State or federal tax incentives
or regulations like renewable portfolio standards or renewable fuel
standards. About 18 states have RPS now.

DOE  also  serves  a  regulatory  function.  In  my  office,  we  have  an
appliance  standard  setting  operation  where  we  set  a  floor  for  en-
ergy efficiency levels for consumer appliances.

I  think,  third,  we  build  partnerships  with  groups  like  EPA  on
ENERGY  STAR,  which,  in  terms  of  consumer  goods,  it  is  kind  of
a  voluntary  upper  limit  that  pulls  the  technology  up  into  the  mar-
ketplace.

Fourth,  I  think  you  have  to  have  a  very  aggressive  and  com-
prehensive  communications  and  outreach  effort  to  tell  consumers
over  and  over  again  about  energy-saving  tips.  For  example,  inflate
your tires to the right pounds per square inch or the energy saving
steps you can take in your own home. The easy things to the hard
things.  And  you  could  buy  ENERGY  STAR  appliances.  In  these
ways you can reach millions of consumers.

And  fifth,  I  think  the  Department  has  to  work  better  with  other
federal  agencies.  For  example,  we  spend  a  lot  of  time  building
bridges with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They have a rural
development  program  with  millions  of  dollars  in  terms  of  grants
and  loans  and  loan  guarantees  where  they  are  following  for  the
first time ever an energy title from a farm bill. That title instructed
USDA  and  DOE  to  work  together  to  get  some  energy-saving  and
renewable energy technologies into the rural marketplace.

So  it  is  a  collection  of  things  that  the  Department,  the  private
sector,  state  and  local  governments  can  do  together.  It  is  a  lot  of
pieces along that technology continuum to move from an idea to the
marketplace.

Mr. HONDA. To the Chair, if I may, I heard what you are saying,
and it sounds like you describe what actually exists right now. But
there are folks still out there in the community that still recognizes
this  gap,  the  Valley  of  Death  gap.  That  is  what  we  call  it.  And  it
seems  to  me  the  government  has  a  role  in—to  play  to  help  some
of  these  technologies  to  go  a  little  further  along  until  the  private
sector  feels  confident  that  that  technology  can  be  commercialized.
And  the  question  again  is  what  Department—what  part  of  your
Department  or  what  functions  does  the  Department  play  in  terms
of  helping  the  technology  transfer?  Or  is  there  a  need  for  another
piece there to make that transfer seamless?

Mr.  FAULKNER.  Well,  ultimately,  I  think  it  is  the  private  sector.
It  is  the  companies  that  will  make  or  produce  a  product  and  sell
something for a profit that gets it into the marketplace. I really be-
lieve  that  the  key  to  all  of  this  is  building  partnerships  to  do  re-
search  and  development  and  you  move  it  along  this  continuum.

77

And  if  the  private  sector  is  putting  money  on  the  table  with  you,
sharing the costs from basic research to demonstrate they are going
to  pay  attention  to  it,  and  they  are  going  to  have  an  incentive  to
pull  these  things  into  the  marketplace.  That  is  not  to  say  the  gov-
ernment  has  no  role.  I  was  trying  to  describe  briefly  that  we  do
have  a  role.  Setting  standards  for  appliances,  for  example  can  do
a  lot  to  get,  you  know,  that  the—that  can  start  the  more  of  these
technologies into the marketplace. I am going to be buying soon an
air  conditioner,  one  step  above  the  new  standards  we  set,  and  a
new  energy-efficient  furnace.  And  I  think  if  consumers  do  that,  as
they replace equipment in their homes or companies do that——

Mr. HONDA. I guess I will be more specific.
In the area of nanoscale activities, the length of research is going
to  be  much  longer  and  much  more  complicated,  and  it  is  going  to
be—there is going to be more need for government-private partner-
ships to move the technology and the research for it closer to com-
mercialization where the private investors are able to see the light
at  the  end  of  the  tunnel,  whether  it  is,  maybe,  three  years  or  four
years out. Beyond that, you know, there is some issue around con-
fidence  or  there  is  an  issue  around  whether  they  will  be  able  to
sustain that kind of investment. It seems to me that we have some
sort of responsibility, not unlike when the Internet was first devel-
oped.

Is there a way or is there a need for further—a closer look at this
kind  of  activity  between  government  and  the  private  industry  to
help  this  kind  of  massive  research  reach  closer  to  commercializa-
tion on the market?

Mr.  FAULKNER.  Well,  in  terms  of  the  nanotechnology  revolution,
I would leave that to my colleague, Dr. Orbach, whose office works
on that more than we do. But I——

Mr. HONDA. Okay.
Mr.  FAULKNER.  I  don’t  see  a  need  for  that.  I  think  we  just  need
to  do  more  of  partnerships  building,  which  is  a  pretty  tough  thing
to do, and focus on working more with the private sector.

Mr. HONDA. Dr. Orbach.
Mr. KOLEVAR. Congressman, if I can add a point to the issue.
You  mentioned  your  concern  about  the  Valley  of  Death  for  revo-
lutionary  technologies.  And  it  is  an  important  question,  and  it
doesn’t  just  pertain  to  revolutionary  technologies.  I  mean,  it  per-
tains  to  the  short-term  technologies.  I  have  been  in  this  position
now  for  10  weeks  and  have  gone  through  and  looked  at  a  number
of  the  R&D  efforts  underway  and  have  identified  some  where  we
have  worked,  whether  in  cooperation  with  industry  or  labs,  to  de-
velop some really intriguing and promising short-term technologies
that  benefited  the  fringe.  I  mean,  they  are  not  revolutionary.  But
getting  them  out  of  the  lab  and  into  industry,  it  is  very  difficult.
And  there  are  a  number  of  challenges  that  change  with  the  indus-
try  that  you  are  looking  at.  I  mean,  most  of  them  are  just  trust
issues  and  how  much  money  are  they  going  to  have  to  expend  on
this  and  are  they  sure  that  it  will  be  successful,  and  do  they  have
to worry about it interfering with their current systems.

My  own  sense  is  there  is  not  going  to  be  a  standard  model  that
will apply across the board. And so it will take a constantly—in my
opinion,  a  constantly  evolving  effort  that  will  be  different  for  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:35 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 020735 PO 00000 Frm 00081 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\042705\20735 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

78

types  of  research  that  are  being  done  by  offices,  whether  rep-
resented at this table or elsewhere. But it is absolutely crucial, be-
cause  to  the  extent  that  the  Federal  Government  is  investing
money  in  this  R&D  and  that  it  somehow  stalls  in  that  Valley  of
Death,  it  is  about  as  close  to  wasted  money  as  it  can  be.  Perhaps
the technology could be picked up at a later date if somebody finds
value  and  finds  a  way  to  commercialize  it,  but  just  in  my  look,  it
strikes—it  has  been  very  frustrating  to  identify  some  promising,
near-term  technologies  that  were  not  done,  you  know,  whether  by
industry  or  the  labs  or  by  the  government,  with  a  sound  enough
road  map  in  mind.  And  for  that  reason,  we  are  not  going  to  see
commercialization in a time frame where we could have, and there-
fore, we will not realize the benefits of those.

So  the  point  you  raise,  in  my  thinking,  is  absolutely  crucial.  My
response would be it is very hard and it probably is not a set model
across  different  applied  R&D  programs  because  of  the  constitu-
encies and the interest groups with which they work. It is probably
going to have to be modeled differently each time, and to really fol-
low on what Doug Faulkner said, it will have to be a strong, public-
private partnership, not just the Federal Government and industry,
but also, you know, states and other interested bodies, academia as
well.

Mr. HONDA. Yeah. I don’t disagree. And I think that the partner-
ship needs to be there so that no one person or no one group choos-
es winners and losers. That is the one. And I believe that the con-
cept—maybe conceptually you can create an approach that morphs
itself according to the needs that you are looking at.

Thank you, Madame Chair.
Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  Yeah.  The  gentleman’s  time  has  expired.
The gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Inglis, is recognized.
Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Ms. Chairman.
I  am  very  excited  about  cracking  water  and  creating  hydrogen
and  moving  toward  energy  independence.  But  it  also  seems  we
need to crack some solutions relating to storage and distribution of
hydrogen.

What kind of research should we be doing to get toward cracking
those solutions, getting those solutions on storage and distribution?
Dr. ORBACH. If I might respond to that. You have identified some
of  the  major  issues  facing  the  hydrogen  economy:  production,  stor-
age, and fuel cells. And here, the Department is working as a team
with the Office of Science and the Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Energy  to  address  those  issues.  We  have  had  a  major  workshop
last  year  where  we  focused  on  the  three  areas  you  identified,  and
we  are  using  the  modern  tools  we  have  to  address  them.  These
would  include  better  catalysts  to  lower  the  temperature  for  the
cracking process you talked about.

Mr. INGLIS. Right.
Dr. ORBACH. We also are looking at open structures that we can
artificially  create  for  hydrogen  storage  with  just  the  right  amount
of absorption. And finally, in fuel cells, we are looking at new mate-
rials  that  will  be  cheaper  and  more  efficient  in  terms  of  the  mem-
branes  that  are  essentially  the  biggest  hang-up  right  now  for  fuel
cell operations.

So  all  three  of  them  have  come  together  in  an  integrated  pro-
gram  between  our  two  offices.  We  are,  as  I  said  before,  going  to
award  about  70  grants  that  are  in  those  three  areas.  They  are,  by
the  way,  in  universities,  National  Laboratories,  and  industries.
There is a broad spectrum of interest in just those areas. And those
grants will be awarded next month as a consequence of a competi-
tion  where  we  had  over  800  preproposals.  We  probably  could  have
supported  twice  as  many  grants  and  maintained  the  same  level  of
quality.

So  I  think  you  are  going  to  see  some,  what  I  would  call,  revolu-
tionary  steps  in  addressing  those  three  areas  as  this  research  pro-
gram develops.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  by  the  way,  we  hope  to  get  you  more  money  to
fund  more  of  those  grants,  because  it  seems  to  me  it  is  essential.
We also hope to—that the energy bill is improved with Senate lan-
guage  that  eliminates  some  of  the  earmarks  on  some  of  those
things  so  that  we  steer  the  money  to  where  it  is  actually  going  to
get some results rather than through the political process.

And  anyone  else  want  to  add  something  about  what  kind  of  re-
search  we  could  be  doing,  what  we  should  be  doing  to  get  after
these things of storage and distribution?

Mr.  KOLEVAR.  Well,  I  am  sorry,  Congressman,  when  you  are
talking  storage  and  distribution,  I  guess,  are  you—are  we  talking
about fossil resources, gasoline, or are we talking hydrogen in par-
ticular?

Well, the—I think I will defer to Doug, who obviously has devel-

oped that with his office.

Mr. INGLIS. Yeah.
Mr.  FAULKNER.  I  think  Dr.  Orbach  hit  most  of  the  main  points.
One other thing I would note is we are also looking at, between our
two  offices  and  other  parts  of  the  government,  on  the  bio-refinery,
the equivalent of the petrochemical refinery. I think the biorefinery
will  play  a  role  down  the  road  in  this  whole  hydrogen  revolution
that is unfolding. A biomass refinery, which could take any number
of  feed  stocks  and  then  produce  fuels  and  power  and  different
chemical  products,  possibly  including  hydrogen.  I  think  that  is
something  else  to  think  about  as  we  move  down  the  road,  which
would also have an impact on rural economic development.

Dr. ORBACH. And also, we are looking at biological microbial pro-
duction of hydrogen. There are microbes that do produce hydrogen.
They  are  rather  inefficient,  and  we  are  currently  in—exploring  ge-
netic  engineering  to  try  to  increase  their  efficiency  so  that  we  can
do this in a natural environment.

Mr.  INGLIS.  It  is  very  exciting.  And  of  course  we  are  excited
about  it  in  South  Carolina,  because  in—the  Savannah  River  Site
now is a National Lab, and for 30 years, we have been dealing with
hydrogen under pressure. It is just that ours is radioactive, so ours
glows  in  addition  to  dealing  with  it  under  pressure.  We  have  had
real reason to keep it under pressure. So because of that expertise,
we  want  to  be  helpful  in  developing  some  solutions  to  the  storage
and distribution part of the equation as we move toward a—energy
independence with a hydrogen economy.

And  it  is,  in  my  opinion,  a  very  bright  future.  And  I  hope  that
you will continue to call on us at the Science Committee and at this

subcommittee  and  at  the  Research  Subcommittee,  which  I  Chair,
to help crack those challenges and get on toward this.

So I thank you for the work you are doing.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. The gentleman yields back.
The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, is recognized for five min-

utes.

Mr. GREEN. Thank you, Madame Chair.
And thank you to the Ranking Member, as well.
I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  initiating  this  hearing  regarding
the fiscal year 2006 budget request for the Department of Energy’s
civilian research and development programs.

I would like to address a question, if I may, to Mr. Kolevar, and

I trust that I have pronounced your name correctly, sir.

Following the northeastern energy grid blackout in 2003, a lot of
attention  was  focused  on  securing  our  electrical  grid  systems,  and
I  might  add,  a  lot  of  consternation  was  created  in  the  minds  of
many  people  in  the  country  at  that  time.  I  am  understanding  that
the Office of Energy Delivery and Energy Reliability, known as OE,
is  the  lead—is  taking  the  lead  in  modernizing  such  efforts  with  a
request of $96 million, approximately, I believe $95.6 million, to be
more  specific.  And  I  am  concerned  about  two  aspects  of  this:  the
GridWise  and  the  GridWorks  initiatives.  I  would  like  to  get  some
understanding as to what you estimate the budget to be, the break-
down.  Will  there  be  additional  needs  that  we  will  have  to  confront
as  we  move  forward?  And  generally  speaking,  where  are  we  with
these two initiatives?

Mr. KOLEVAR. Thank you, Congressman.
The  fiscal  year  2006  request  for  the  two  programs  combined  is
$10.5  million,  $5.5  million  of  that  for  GridWise.  The  overall  num-
ber,  $10.5  million,  is  consistent  with  the  Administration’s  request
in fiscal year 2005. The projects I think, as you know, are different
but  symbiotic.  GridWise  is  really  the  brains  of  the  infrastructure.
It  is  mostly  software  systems  designed  to  monitor  and  relay  infor-
mation faster and better. GridWorks is the infrastructure behind it:
improved cables, conductors, and the like.

Those two projects—well, I should say, those two headers encom-
pass  a  lot  of  projects  within.  And  I  think  we  are  very  able—very
effectively able to leverage the federal dollars with work that is on-
going  in  the  labs  and  in  the  universities.  We  have  strong  partner-
ships  with  a  number  of  universities  across  the  Nation  on  both  of
these elements. And I was in Atlanta last week and saw a peer re-
view for the GridWise project and was very impressed by a number
of  technologies  that  have  emerged  from  there  that  allow  operators
to  see  more  clearly  what  is  going  on,  not  just  within  their  system,
but  within  neighboring  systems,  which  is  absolutely  key  to  pre-
venting a 2003 type blackout.

And  then  on  the  GridWorks  type  of  work,  actually,  while  I  am
here, back in—at the Department, we have a number of technology
experts from across the lab complex and some universities engaged
in a review of the projects that we fund through that program right
now  that  really  give  a  better  sense,  as  we  move  forward  on  the
2007  budget  development,  as  to  which  ones  are  really  the  most  ef-
fective and where are we getting the best use, the most return, on
our federal dollars, where are we, candidly, not getting a return on

our  federal  dollars.  Are  there  programs  that  we  should  see,  you
know,  moving  to  an  off-ramp  so  that  the  resources  can  be  better
spent on others that seem to be much more promising?

The—both  programs,  I  have  to  say,  I  have  been  very  impressed
by  the  quality  of  the  work,  whether  it  is,  you  know,  a  lab  applica-
tion  or  a  university  application.  And  I  do  think  that  much  of  this
work  we  will  start  to  see  penetrating  in  the  commercial  sector  in
the next several years.

Mr. GREEN. Thank you, Madame Chair.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
The  gentleman  from  Michigan,  Mr.  Ehlers,  is  recognized  for  five

minutes.

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Madame Chair.
And  I  apologize  for  missing  much  of  the  meeting,  but  I  had  a
markup  in  Transportation,  which  I  was  offering  a  very,  very  good
amendment, and I thought my——

Chairwoman BIGGERT. I assume that it passed then?
Mr. EHLERS. Yes.
I—you gentlemen at that table represent, in my mind, just about
the  most  important  group  of  people  in  this  country  at  this  point,
because  I  am  convinced  that  we  absolutely  have  to  reduce  our  de-
pendence on foreign imports of energy. We have to do a much bet-
ter  job  of  using  our  energy.  And  I  am  not  alone  in  that  thinking.
And  many  times,  I  have  met  people  who  regard  this  as  sort  of  a
fuzzy-headed,  knee-jerk,  liberal  idea  that  we  have  to  improve  our
energy  efficiency,  but  I  am  very  pleased  the  Energy  Future  Coali-
tion  has  developed  a  plan  they  called  ‘‘Set  America  Free:  A  Blue-
print  for  U.S.  Energy  Security’’  has  nothing  to  do  with  environ-
mental  considerations.  It  has  everything  to  do  with  national  secu-
rity considerations. And these are by very knowledgeable people.

I  think  it  is  clear  that  we  can  save—we  can  improve  our  energy
supplies  far  more  and  far  more  cheaply  through  conservation  and
efficiency  than  by  any  other  short-term  means.  And  so  I  was  dis-
appointed  that  the  President’s  budget—or  the  Administration’s
budget  suggests  cutting  buildings  R&D  programs  by  11.5  percent.
Buildings account for almost 40 percent of our energy consumption,
and we ought to be working very, very hard on that and not cutting
the funding.

The  American  Council  for  Energy  Efficient  Economy  has  noticed
that  very  small  changes  in  demand  for  energy  can  result  in  much
larger  drops  in  energy  prices,  and  I  know  my  natural  gas  heating
bill  has  doubled  in  less  than  a  decade.  I  would  very  much  appre-
ciate  very  strong  efforts  to  reduce  the  use  of  natural  gas.  I  think
it  would  be  very  beneficial  for  the  economy  if  the  price  of  natural
gas dropped.

Also,  we  need  better  efficiency  in  transportation,  which  is  an-
other  huge—I  believe  it  is  25  percent  of  the  use.  And  again,  if  we
can do that, the price of oil will drop.

Can you assure me that you—the Department of Energy is—and
I apologize for your budget cut this year. I think that is disastrous,
and  we  will  try  to  reverse  that  in  the  Congress  or  change  it,  but
can you assure me that the Department of Energy is really putting
full  effort  into  achieving  these  efforts,  going  in  the  direction  of  en-

ergy  independence  by  energy  conservation,  and  above  all,  energy
efficiency?

Mr. Faulkner.
Mr. FAULKNER. Yes, sir.
I think I will make a couple of points.
Our budget is still about  o to B weighted toward energy efficiency
over  renewables.  We  have  a  lot  of  different  priorities  in  our  office.
I  mentioned  earlier  in  my  oral  testimony  that  we  are  proud,  and
take pains to defend, the balance and the diversity in our portfolio.
I think the building sector is an important one. You are absolutely
right.  And  it  is  not  just  the  R&D.  It  is  also  looking  at  setting  the
standards  for  appliances,  which  will  help  boost  the  energy  effi-
ciency of the marketplace.

I  would  also  note  that  Chairman  Greenspan,  in  a  recent  speech,
talked about the incredible success story of how the energy use per
GDP  in  the  economy,  since  the  1970s,  has  shown  a  steady  drop,  a
continuing drop. Part of that is, of course, due to R&D, but I think
part  of  it,  as  he  noted,  too,  is  due  to  the  cost  of  energy  and  what
that  does  to  businesses,  their  incentive  to  reduce  energy  use  and
home  use.  And  also  I  think  we  have  to  do  a  better  job,  and  con-
tinuing to do a good job, of educating the public, getting that word
out  about  how  you  can  use  better  energy-efficient  appliances,  how
you  can  do  things  in  your  home  that  are  simple-to-complex,  cheap
and expensive.

Mr. EHLERS. May I just interrupt there for a moment?
I  think  that  maybe  the  most  important  thing  you  can  do,  and  I
have  always  admired  Agriculture,  through  their  cooperative  exten-
sion  service,  what  they  discover  in  the  lab  one  year  is  used  in  the
fields  the  following  year.  However,  in  energy  efficiency,  just  as  an
example, I—when I was at Berkeley, they developed the energy-ef-
ficient  windows.  It  took  20  years  for  that  energy  to  be  used  in  a
big way in the field. I mean, whatever you can do to get that word
out  through  setting  up  a  cooperative  extension  type  of  arrange-
ment,  the  public  is  woefully  ignorant  about  energy  I  think  pri-
marily because it is intangible. They don’t—they can’t see it, touch
it,  feel  it,  smell  it.  They  don’t  understand  it.  And  so  you  have  real
educational job to do.

Dr. ORBACH. And I would also like to add that there are tremen-
dous  opportunities,  inefficiencies  that  you  identified.  One  of  them
is  in  the  white  light  solid  state  lighting.  About  20  percent  of  our
electricity  is  used  for  lighting.  And  the  incandescent  bulb  is  about
five  percent;  fluorescent  is  about  25  percent  efficient.  With  solid
state  lighting,  in  the  white,  natural  light,  we  can  get  those  effi-
ciencies up by factors of two, at least.

Mr. EHLERS. Right.
Dr. ORBACH. And so we are working very hard on developing new
light  sources  that  are  solid  state  to  try  to  reduce  the  energy  con-
sumption.

Mr. EHLERS. And did you have any projections of the price?
Dr.  ORBACH.  Well,  right  now,  I  think—I  have  forgotten  the  frac-
tion,  but  a  significant  number  of  traffic  lights  are  solid  state.  You
have seen them by the little round dots. They save $1,000 per year
per  intersection.  And  our  estimate,  very  roughly  speaking,  is  if  we
could  replace  incandescent  and  fluorescent  lights  with  solid  state

lighting,  we  could  make  the  equivalent  of  creating  50  new  nuclear
power  stations  in  the  United  States  in  terms  of  savings.  So  there
is a huge opportunity there. And indeed, industry and our own re-
search are working hard on that.

Mr. EHLERS. I thank you very much.
And I will yield back, since I have used up my time.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Ehlers.
The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Costello, is recognized.
Mr.  COSTELLO.  I  thank  the  Chair,  and  I  thank  the  Chair  for—
and  Mr.  Honda,  the  Ranking  Member,  for  calling  this  hearing
today.

And  I  just  want  to  apologize,  as  my  friend  from  Michigan  did.  I
was  in  the  same  markup,  and  I  want  to  attest  to  the  fact  that  he
did offer a very important amendment, and hopefully we are going
to  deal  with  that  issue  at  some  time  in  the  not-too-distant  future,
because I think you are right on point.

Mr. Maddox, it is good to see you again. We have met before, and
we have talked about the FutureGen project that the initiative that
the Administration is supporting, and I had an opportunity to meet
with  the  Secretary  of  Energy  recently  where  he  reconfirmed  the
commitment on the part of the Administration and the Department
of  Energy  to  move  FutureGen  along.  And  I  first  want  to  commend
both  President  Bush  and  the  Department  of  Energy  and  the  Ad-
ministration  for  their  strong  support  for  FutureGen.  I  think  it  is
important for the future of this country.

The—as  you  know,  the  entire  Illinois  delegation,  including  this
speaker  and  all  19  Members  of  the  House  and  both  of  our  United
States  Senators,  have  sent  a  letter  to  both  the  President  and  the
Secretary  supporting  FutureGen.  I  know  that  Congressman—my
colleague  from  Illinois,  Congressman  Shimkus,  and  I  recently,  not
too  many  months  ago,  met  with  you  and  presented  petitions  by
over  10,000  residents  in  southern  Illinois  supporting  the  project,
and they are hopeful that, not only that the project will go forward,
but also that the project will be built in Illinois.

I  wonder  if  you  might  give  us  an  update  as  to  the  progress  that
has been made by the Department moving forward with FutureGen
and  then  give  me  a  timeline  as  to  your  objectives  and  some  of  the
things you want to achieve by specific dates.

Mr.  MADDOX.  Thank  you  very  much,  and  it  is  good  to  see  you

I can confirm your statement that the folks in Illinois are in full
voice on this issue, and we hear from them on a very regular basis.
I  would  just  say,  right  now,  I  am  probably  the  most  optimistic
and  confident  FutureGen  will  go  forward  at  any  time  since  it  was
first  initiated  by  the  President.  We  have  given  the  private  sector
the  confidence  that  the  Federal  Government  will  meet  its  commit-
ments on funding going forward. We—they have joined us in nego-
tiations. Those negotiations are going forward really on two tracks:
one  track  on  the  legal  agreements,  but  also  a  separate  track  on
NEPA  issues  in  order  to  try  to  move  quickly  on  the  NEPA  issues.
Our expectation or our hope is if we can get an agreement done by
mid-summer,  that  some  time  in  the  next  three  to  six  months,  we
can put out an initial request for interest for siting locations.

again.

And  additionally,  the  confidence,  from  my  standpoint,  has
reached  a  point  where  a  recent  trip  to  China,  I  did  formally  ask
the Chinese government to become a part of this FutureGen. I have
also  approached  several  other  governments,  and  that  is  becoming
one  of  my  priorities  now  is  to  go  out  and  start  soliciting  inter-
national partners to become—to join FutureGen as well.

So  as  I  said  at  the  beginning,  I  am  very  confident,  and  that,  I
think,  gives  you  a  rough  timeline  of  some  of  the  critical  issues  of
where we are now.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  The—my  understanding  is  the  consortium,  the
partners,  have  come  together.  There  was  a  meeting  in  March,  as
I  understand.  What  is  the  next  thing  for  them  to  do?  Will  they  be
meeting again? Is it scheduled? What do they need to do?

Mr. MADDOX. We have actually had three meetings. I am not real
certain when the fourth is scheduled for. And I am not certain how
much  of  it—I  am  not  directly  involved  in  negotiations.  A  lot  of
those  are  procurement  issues  and  procurement-sensitive,  not  to  be
sworn  in  and  various  other  issues.  I  know  they  are  meeting  on  a
regular basis, and that is kind of the status I can give you on that.
But  I  have  asked  repeatedly,  ‘‘Are  there  issues  that  look  like
showstoppers?’’ and have been assured there are none.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  I  know  that  you  are  not  in  a  position  to  give  us
a  definitive  date,  but  you  have  noted  that  you  are  more  optimistic
now  than  you  ever  have  been  that  the  project  is  going  to  happen.
Do  you  think  that  we  will  be  at  a  point  some  time  this  calendar
year to make a judgment as to narrowing it down to site selection?
Mr.  MADDOX.  I  think  it  will  be  at  a  juncture  this  calendar  year
where we will have asked everyone who is interested in hosting the
FutureGen  project  to  express  interest  and  begin  that  process  of
winnowing down by the end of this calendar year.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  I  thank  you.  And  again,  I  thank  the  Administra-
tion  and  the  Department  of  Energy  for  your  strong  support.  It  is
an important project. We, of course, hope that it is built in Illinois,
but  even  if  it  is  not  built  in  Illinois,  it  is  an  important  project.  We
have  a  250-year  supply  of  coal  in  the  United  States.  We  need  to
figure out a way to burn it in an environmentally-safe manner, and
this project will, in fact, move us forward to doing that.

So I commend you, and I want you to know that if there is any-
thing  that  we  can  do  as  a  delegation  to  assist  you,  please  don’t
hesitate to call on us.

Mr. MADDOX. Thank you very much.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. The gentleman yields back, and that con-

cludes our first round.

I think we will have a second round, if we can do it very briefly.
I  have  two  questions.  I  had  three,  but,  fortunately,  Dr.  Ehlers
asked  one  of  them,  so  maybe  I  can  get  these  two  within  this  time
with a short question and short answers.

First  of  all,  for  Mr.  Johnson,  as  was  mentioned  in  my  opening
statement about the President coming forward with the—proposing
for  new  nuclear  facilities.  Do  you  think  that  the  U.S.  industry
will—is willing to participate in the large-scale research efforts?

And  secondly,  I  just  returned  from  France  and  the  Netherlands
looking at reprocessing plants, nuclear plants there. And it is some-
thing that we have developed here in the United States and in Illi-

nois  and  has—you  know,  has—was  shut  down  quite  a  while  ago,
but this is the—to me, is the way to go as far as how we are going
to  deal  with  nuclear  waste  and  also  how  we  are  going  to  conserve
the  energy  which  we  are  now—so  much  of  the  nuclear  energy  we
are  just  putting  into  the  waste  rather  than  reprocessing,  will  that
be part of this proposal? Sorry.

Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you, Madame Chairwoman.
With respect to the industry support for our Nuclear Power 2010
program  and  moving  forward  on  a  path  that  will  hopefully  lead  to
a  decision  by  industry  to  go  forward  with  a  new  plant  order  and
the  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  plant,  we  have  been  pleasantly
surprised  with  the  support  of  industry  and  the  enthusiasm  across
the industry. We do have, we believe, two very strong industry util-
ity-led  consortia  who  are  pursuing  our  regulatory  demonstration
project  with  us  at  this  time:  the  Dominion-led  team  and  the  new
ENERGY  STAR.  They  are  clearly  serious  about  this,  more  so—for
the  first  time  in  a  long  time,  and  we  hold  out  a  great  hope  and
promise. If our second phase here on our combined construction op-
erating  license  demonstration  project  is  anything  like  the  experi-
ence  that  we  have  gained  over  the  last  couple  of  years  with  our
early-side  permit  projects,  this  program  will  continue  to  be  a  suc-
cess.

With  respect  to  your  question  on—the  question  of  reprocessing
overseas,  whether  in  Europe  or  Japan,  as  you  know,  the  Depart-
ment  is  pursuing  looking  at  the  separations  technology  for  spent
nuclear fuel as part of our Advanced Fuel Cycle program. Our focus
in that program is looking at how can we safely, securely, in a pro-
liferation-resistant  manner,  treat  the  spent  fuel  that  is  produced
from the current fleet of operating reactors. We are looking at that,
both  from  a  separation  of  the  spent  fuel  constituents  point  of  view
and also refabrication of those spent fuel constituents into new fuel
to  be  recycled  back  into  either  existing  reactors  or  possibly  in  the
Generation IV fast reactors that we are currently pursuing.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
Well, now I have got three questions here.
Dr. Orbach, they are both for you, and you probably would expect
me  to  ask  both  of  these,  but  given  the  limited  funds,  many  in  the
fusion  research  committee  have  told  us  that  the  United  States
should  drop  its  participation  in  ITER  if  it  would  require  deep  cuts
in funding for domestic programs. Do you agree with this?

Dr.  ORBACH.  Yes,  I  would,  because  the  strong  domestic  program
is  critical  to  the  success  of  ITER  and  to  the  success  of  the  United
States in participation. In the 2006 budget, we have had to reduce,
somewhat,  the  domestic  program,  but  I  would  like  you  to  look  at
that  in  terms  of  a  reorientation  of  the  domestic  program  rather
than  a  reduction.  ITER  itself  is  an  experimental  device.  It  will  be
the largest experiment ever conducted, and we believe that the in-
tellectual opportunities there are enormous. And——

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  But  we  have  put  so  much  into  that—into
this  budget  for  this  year,  and  there  isn’t  even  a  site  yet,  be  it
France or Japan.

Dr. ORBACH. Well, we hope that by July there will be a site deci-
sion.  Both  parties,  the  European  Union  and  the  Japanese,  have

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:35 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 020735 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\042705\20735 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

86

stated  publicly  that  they  hope  to  reach  a  decision  between  them-
selves by July.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Okay.
Then  this  question  you  probably  know  that  I  would  ask.  And  I

save the best for the last.

There—you  know,  the  Rare  Isotope  Accelerator  is  an  important
project for nuclear physics and for the Nation. And is it still a pri-
ority for the DOE and the Office of Science?

Dr.  ORBACH.  The  answer  is  yes.  It  tied  for  third  in  our  20-year
facility outlook. Secretary Bodman has written that it is a very im-
portant  scientific  program,  both  for  nuclear  physics  and  also  na-
tional security. And our problem, of course, is that currently we do
not have a funding structure for it, and so we have withheld the—
request for proposals.

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  Well,  what  is  the  status  of  the  NCAC  re-

view?

Dr. ORBACH. We believe that the NSAC review——
Chairwoman BIGGERT. I mean NSAC.
Dr.  ORBACH.  Yes.  It  is  the  Nuclear  Science  Advisory  Committee
review. They—we are hoping to get a response from them by June.
Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  Okay.  So  there  is  no  funding,  but  the—

but perhaps a placeholder?

Dr.  ORBACH.  Well,  we  have  R&D  funding  in  the  2006  budget.

There is $4 million, which is a continuation——

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Which is the placeholder.
Dr. ORBACH.—of the R&D, and that is because it is an important
project  for  us.  And  we  don’t  want  to  let  go  of  it.  That  money  will
be well used for the development of the project itself.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Okay. Thank you.
Mr. Honda, do you——
Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Madame Chair.
To  Mr.  Kolevar,  I  have  been  meeting  with  some  folks  and  their
municipal  utilities,  and  there  were  some  concerns  about  how  costs
are  driven  up  because  of,  I  guess,  routing  of  electrons  and  the  dis-
tribution  of  it  and  how  they  are  managed  or  manipulated.  And  I
was  just  wondering  what  role  that  you  could  describe  for  us,  the
role of the electric utilities and the development with DOE of real-
time  monitoring  and  the  control  software  tools  and  system  oper-
ating  models  that  are  at  the  core  of  your  transmission  reliability
and  distribution  R&D  programs.  I  am  trying  to  understand  a—
what appears to be a very complicated management of electrons as
it  relates  to  cost  and  passing  costs  onto  consumers,  whether  the
utilities  or  the  municipalities.  I  am  having  a—I  would  like  some
help in understanding that.

Mr. KOLEVAR. Sometimes I like help in understanding it.
It—I  think,  clearly,  50  years  ago,  if  people  had  been  asked,  you
know,  ‘‘We  are  going  to  start  fresh,  and  what  is  the  grid  going  to
look like?’’ we probably would have had a different design than we
had  today.  I  don’t  think  that  would  surprise  anybody.  But  the  na-
ture  of  the  market,  the  nature  of  the  fractured  jurisdictions,  com-
peting  companies  are  often  very  reluctant  to  share  market  data
and  proprietary  data,  because  it  can  affect  their  bottom  line,  dra-
matically  impacts  the  costs  that  end-use  consumers  can  face,  even
when they are within a relatively small area. And it is a challenge.

It—my  office  addresses  it  and  comes  at  it  in  two  ways.  One,  of
which you mentioned, is technology development along the lines of
monitoring  systems,  aggregating  data  to  really  find,  you  know—to
get where the energy is flowing efficiently and probably with some
capability in the future to identify costs, where costs are being allo-
cated  along  various  lines.  The  second  side  of  our  office’s  work  on
that is on the analytical side, and it is working with municipalities,
with  regional  organizations,  with  states  to  identify  future  goals
with  respect  to  development  to  identify  constraints  within  the  sys-
tem. You know, a lot of times you have, in a lot of regions, the abil-
ity  to  produce  more  energy  but  not  really  push  it  along  to  end-use
consumers,  because  you  have,  you  know,  constraints.  Path  15  in
California is one notable one, probably notable because we fixed it.
It took a long time to do.

And so it is a difficult challenge. My sense is that it will be driv-
en—that reforms in this area will be driven by the passage of effec-
tive,  comprehensive  energy  legislation.  And  in  my  opinion,  the
House’s actions with the bill that passed out recently will go a long
way  towards  helping,  and  it  will  be  because  we  have  systems  in
place  to  encourage  the  development  of  regional  entities,  who  don’t
necessarily  have  a  profit  margin  or  a  profit  motive  at  the  end  of
the day. They have the interest of the consumer at their heart. And
empowering  regional  entities  to  work  within  states  or  within  sev-
eral  states  will  go  a  long  way  toward  helping  level  the  sometimes
very differing cost scales within regions for price.

But  I  will  tell  you,  on  the  technology  side,  we  have  some  very
promising  R&D  projects  that  we  are  pursuing  that  are—that  I—
that are starting to see commercial penetration that are—that have
the potential to have a cost impact and that you can start to trace,
you know, who is paying for what along various lines, but also have
a huge—can have a huge impact on reliability in that you—in that
operators  and  operators’  neighbors  would  be  able  to  see  fluctua-
tions  in  the  grid  that  might  precede  a  low-voltage  event,  a  brief
blackout, or what could actually cascade into a big blackout and re-
spond very quickly to correcting that frequency change and thereby
increase  reliability  for  consumers.  And  at  the  end  of  the  day,  the
country  loses  a  lot  of  money  from  blackouts,  probably  o  of  it  from
your very momentary blackouts. You know, you get home and your
alarm clock is blinking. That kind of blackout is a minor inconven-
ience  to  you  and  me.  We  go  home  and  we  reset  our  alarm  clock.
It is a major inconvenience to somebody like Intel who can lose an
entire chip-line from, you know, a 10-second occurrence.

Being able to address those brief occurrences, those brief outages,
and  increase  the  reliability  of  the  system  will  save  the  Nation  a
great deal of money in the future.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. The gentleman yields back.
Before we bring this hearing to a close, I want to thank our pan-
elists  for  testifying  before  the  Energy  Subcommittee  today.  And  I
would  agree  with  Dr.  Ehlers  that  you  and  your  agencies  and  your
testimony  and  your  expertise  are  so  important  to  the  field  of
science,  especially  research  and  development,  and  to  this  Nation
and to the global economy that we live in.

So I thank you so much for being here today.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Raymond  L.  Orbach,  Director  of  the  Office  of  Science,  Department  of

Energy, Washington, DC

Questions submitted by Chairman Judy Biggert
Q1. Last year, you testified that the U.S. contribution for ITER would be about $700
million.  We  understand  that  you  now  consider  that  figure  to  have  been  in  error
and  are  not  sure  where  it  originated.  What  is  the  current  estimate  of  the  U.S.
contribution  to  ITER?  Will  the  U.S.  contribution  be  capped  at  that  level?  Are
there any circumstances under which you can envision that cap being breached?
What  additional  costs  beyond  the  contribution  to  the  ITER  project  itself  do  you
expect the U.S. will incur as a result of its contribution to ITER?

A1. The  current  estimate  originated  with  the  $502  million  value  estimate,  cor-
responding  to  our  10  percent  of  the  ITER  Engineering  Design  Activities  Final  De-
sign  Report  estimate,  and  has  been  revised  to  reflect  guidance  of  the  DOE  413.3
Order  on  Program  and  Project  Management  for  the  Acquisition  of  Capital  Assets,
industrial estimates by U.S. suppliers, revised rates of escalation, and best practices
of DOE project and procurement management.

The current Total Project Cost (TPC) estimate for the U.S. Contributions to ITER
Major  Item  of  Equipment  (MIE)  project  is  $1.122  billion  for  the  eight-year  project
period.  (Note:  Total  Project  Cost  is  the  sum  of  Total  Estimated  Cost—the  U.S.  con-
tributions  of  equipment,  personnel,  and  a  limited  amount  of  cash  supporting  the
personnel  and  the  installation  and  assembly  tasks,  and  Other  Project  Costs—the
specific R&D and design activities that support ITER.) The TPC cap is based on the
June  2003  authorization  from  an  interagency  process  led  by  the  State  Department
and  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  to  negotiate  the  multilateral  ITER
Agreement.  The  only  known  circumstances  under  which  the  cap  could  be  increased
would arise from factors that are deemed to be outside the control of the DOE. For
example,  both  economic  changes  causing  increases  in  projected  escalation  rates  by
the time of the Critical Decision-2 (CD–2) review and changes in currency exchange
rates  affecting  the  cash  parts  of  the  U.S.  Contributions  to  ITER  project  would  con-
stitute bases for increasing the cap.

The  only  additional  costs  that  we  expect  the  U.S.  to  incur  as  a  result  of  our  par-
ticipation  in  the  construction,  operation,  de-activation,  and  decommissioning  of
ITER  will  be  the  research  costs  associated  with  providing  scientists,  engineers,
diagnostics and other associated equipment during the research phase of the experi-
ment.
Q2. Given  the  reduced  funding  outlook  for  Office  of  Science,  do  you  plan  to  revise
your  20-Year  Facilities  Plan?  How  will  you  make  the  choices  between  building
new  and  running  existing  facilities,  and  between  facilities  and  funding  for  re-
search grants?

A2. The Twenty-year Facility Outlook was designed to be a planning document, not
a  budget  document.  The  Office  of  Science  recognizes  that  the  breadth  and  scope  of
the  vision  encompassed  by  these  facilities  reflect  a  most  aggressive  and  optimistic
view of the future of the Office. Nevertheless, we believe that it is necessary to have
and discuss such a vision. Despite the many uncertainties, it is important for orga-
nizations  to  have  a  clear  understanding  of  their  goals  and  a  path  toward  reaching
those  goals.  We  have  held  to  the  priorities  listed,  as  appropriations  and  scientific
considerations  provide.  Under  the  funding  request  for  FY  2006,  we  plan  to  proceed
with the priorities contained in the Outlook.

This is not just a listing of all possible future facilities which will enable the best
science.  The  Twenty-year  Facility  Outlook  only  lists  28  facilities,  and  the  facilities
are  prioritized  according  to  the  best  science  they  will  produce.  The  order  is  like  a
golf score: there is a first, and there is a second. But four facilities are tied for third
for the simple reason that their relative order is difficult if not impossible to obtain
on  purely  scientific  grounds.  These  choices  were  made  with  the  assistance  of  the
U.S. scientific community. Our Advisory Panels assessed the scientific opportunities
in  their  own  fields,  and  set  time  lines  when  these  opportunities  could  mature.  My
office then chose among fields, assigning priority according to our best sense of rel-
ative scientific importance using, of course, the assessments of our Advisory Panels.
While  it  is  DOE’s  intent  to  give  priority  to  these  facilities,  many  steps  need  to
occur  before  deciding  whether  and  when  to  propose  construction  of  each,  including
long-term  budget  estimates,  the  status  of  project  R&D,  conceptual  design  work,  en-

gineering design work and scientific reviews, inclusion in the President’s budget re-
quests, and approval by Congress.

Nuclear Physics
Q3. When  and  how  will  the  Department  make  a  decision  about  the  future  of  its  nu-
clear physics facilities: the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, the Continuous Elec-
tron Beam Accelerator Facility and the Rare Isotope Accelerator?

A3. Initial  decisions  regarding  the  future  of  the  nuclear  physics  facilities  are  ex-
pected  to  be  made  during  the  FY  2007  budget  formulation  process.  As  you  are
aware, federal funding will be constrained in the out-years. The Department will ex-
amine  its  activities  and  opportunities  across  its  portfolio  and  make  decisions  that
will optimize the utilization of the resources available to address national priorities
and  meet  national  needs.  Input  from  the  research  community  has  been  solicited
through  the  Nuclear  Science  Advisory  Committee  (NSAC)  regarding  the  opportuni-
ties for scientific progress and discoveries from the programs at RHIC, CEBAF, and
RIA, and will be part of the decision process.

Question submitted by Representative Dave G. Reichert
Q1. How  do  you  plan  to  address  shortfalls  in  user  facility  funding  such  as  those
faced by Environmental Molecular Science Laboratory (EMSL) at Pacific North-
west National Laboratory? Can you commit that you will support efforts in Con-
gress  to  provide  additional  funds  for  Office  of  Science  user  facilities,  including
EMSL?

A1. The Office of Science (SC) places great value and the highest priority on its Na-
tional Scientific User Facilities. We continue to provide full support for EMSL oper-
ations,  and  have  not  reduced  its  budget  since  it  opened  in  1997.  Through  the  use
of  science  and  management  reviews  by  Advisory  Committees  (e.g.,  Biological  and
Environmental Research Advisory Committee) as well as by internal SC entities, we
seek to balance the needs of National Scientific User Facilities and support for fun-
damental  research  programs  that  use  such  facilities.  We  factor  the  recommenda-
tions of such reviews into our decision-making process for budget development.

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1a. The  existing  national  laboratory  infrastructure  represents  a  sizable  investment

by DOE, especially aging facilities for nuclear-related research.
Has  the  department  examined  how  facilities  that  it  supports  may  be  consoli-
dated to reduce the maintenance needs for older facilities?

A1a. The Deputy Secretary has recently approved an Asset Management Plan to es-
tablish the goals and strategies to guide and evaluate management of Real Property
Assets  in  a  holistic,  performance-based  approach.  The  Asset  Management  Plan  and
the  Department’s  Facilities  Information  Management  System,  the  dynamic  reposi-
tory of facility data, are key facility assessment tools.

The  Department’s  Real  Property  Asset  Management  Order  established  the  re-
quirement for the preparation of comprehensive Ten Year Site Plans (TYSP) to for-
mally integrate long-range real property asset planning with the Department’s stra-
tegic  plan  and  appropriate  planning  guidance.  The  TYSP  addresses  space  and  land
use  across  the  site  to  consolidate  operations  where  practical  and  eliminate  excess
facilities. It addresses facility assets throughout their life cycle (acquisition through
renewal and/or disposal) to control overall facility cost while enhancing the facilities’
contribution to mission effectiveness.
Q1b. Has  the  department  estimated  the  costs  for  decommissioning  consolidated  fa-

cilities?

A1b. At  the  Headquarters  level,  Decontamination  and  Decommissioning  (D&D)
costs  of  contaminated  facilities  have  been  estimated  and  are  reported  as  liabilities
within the Department’s Balance Sheet.

At  the  site  level,  as  noted  above,  the  Department  has  established  the  Ten  Year
Site  Plans  (TYSP)  to  formally  integrate  real  property  asset  planning  with  the  De-
partment’s  strategic  plan  and  appropriate  planning  guidance.  The  TYSP  addresses
facility  assets  throughout  their  life  cycle  (acquisition  through  renewal  and/or  dis-
posal) and considers the business case decisions for facility consolidation, renovation
and decontamination/decommissioning.

Biological and Environmental Research
Q2a. What are the department’s plan to ensure the long-term availability of isotopes

for research, clinical trails, and treatment?

A2a. The Department of Energy (DOE) maintains nuclear technology infrastructure
that  supports  a  wide  range  of  important  research,  isotope  production,  and  other
vital purposes. The planning, maintenance, and safe operation of this infrastructure
is important to DOE. DOE has undertaken measures to address facility capabilities
and upgrades in support of nuclear, scientific, and medical research. An example is
DOE’s  investment  in  the  Isotope  Production  Facility  (IPF),  a  new  production  capa-
bility at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) that will enable almost
year-round production of long-lived accelerator isotopes including many that are not
typically  available  elsewhere.  The  upcoming  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)
study  on  isotope  production,  which  will  include  DOE  participation,  will  help  deter-
mine future needs in this area.
Q2b. With  over  17  million  procedures  performed  in  the  U.S.  last  year,  research  in
nuclear  medicine  is  critical  to  maintaining  our  standard  of  living  and  extend-
ing lives.
The  future  of  research  in  radioisotopes  is  highly  dependent  on  the  availability
of skilled radio-chemists and nuclear chemists. How is the department address-
ing the need to retain and develop such skilled professionals?

A2b. We  have  started  a  dialogue  with  our  colleagues  at  the  NIH  on  the  future  of
the  nuclear  medicine  program,  including  the  training  of  the  next  generation  of
radio-chemists.

Basic Energy Sciences
Q2c. What is the justification for cutting funding for the Radiological (sic) Engineer-

ing Development Center at Oak Ridge National Laboratory?

A2c. The  BES  portion  of  support  for  the  Radiochemical  Engineering  and  Develop-
ment Center (REDC), which provides capabilities for the processing, separation, and
purification  of  transplutonium  elements,  was  terminated  in  FY  2006  because  only
a  handful  of  BES  researchers  make  use  of  the  REDC  annually.  The  funding  was
terminated in order to support higher-priority facilities that together host thousands
of users annually.
Q2d. Has the Office of Science evaluated the cost associated with shutting down this

facility, and has the department budgeted for such an activity?

A2d. It  is  not  anticipated  that  REDC  will  close.  SC  funding  for  REDC  had  been
ramping  down  gradually  over  the  past  two  years  with  the  expectation  that  ORNL
would consolidate work in its many hot cells at the ORNL site into the REDC facil-
ity. Support for REDC would then come from actual users and customers of hot-cell
facilities.

Fusion Energy Sciences
Q3. By  increasing  funds  for  Fusion  Energy  Sciences  in  these  extremely  tight  budget
times,  the  Administration  has  signaled  its  strong  support  for  the  ITER  project,
a  critical  step  in  the  development  of  fusion  energy.  But  the  budget  request  re-
duces  vital  domestic  research  by  $  34.1  million,  which  would  seriously  damage
U.S.  capabilities  to  benefit  from  ITER.  And  this  is  at  a  time  when  U.S.  fusion
energy research funding is already only one-third that of Europe.
• Should  we  take  the  Fiscal  Year  2006  (FY06)  budget  request  for  fusion  as  an
indication  of  how  the  domestic  programs  may  have  to  make  sacrifices  for  our
role in ITER in the future?
• If  not,  how  can  we  continue  the  world-class  research  at  our  facilities  at  home

while still participating in the international effort?

A3. As  you  have  noted,  the  ITER  Project  is  a  critical  step  in  the  development  of
fusion  energy,  with  strong  support  from  the  Administration.  The  ITER  facility  will
provide  a  unique  opportunity  to  investigate  the  complex  science  of  burning  plasma
physics  and  technology,  which  underpins  the  feasibility  of  fusion  as  an  energy
source. The construction and operation of ITER leverages international collaboration
to share the existing knowledge and to minimize the cost of achieving this objective.
ITER  is  an  integral  part  of  the  U.S.  Fusion  Program,  benefiting  from  the  ongoing
research at the major U.S. facilities in theory and computation, technology develop-

93

ment, and U.S. collaborations with the international scientific community. The expe-
rience we will gain from the construction and operation of ITER will benefit the to-
tality  of  the  U.S.  Fusion  program.  In  FY  2006  we  have  re-oriented  the  program  to
accommodate the needs of the ITER Project in addition to established priorities. We
will  adjust  our  priorities  as  appropriate  within  the  annual  budget  allocations  and
maintain a viable U.S. Fusion program to benefit from ITER.

Questions submitted by Representative Lincoln Davis

Leadership Class Computing
Q1. Does  DOE  intend  in  FY07  to  resume  hardware  acquisition  to  actually  establish

a true leadership class computing facility?

A1. The  Department  is  currently  in  the  process  of  developing  its  FY  2007  budget
proposal.
Q2. What  are  the  Department’s  long-term  plans  for  the  leadership  facility  awarded

last year to the team led by Oak Ridge National Lab?

A2. The Department is planning to continue its investment in the Leadership Com-
puting Facility, which will provide a limited number of competitively selected teams
the  capability  to  achieve  scientific  leadership.  The  focus  on  providing  a  small  num-
ber  of  teams  access  to  exceptional  capability  is  key  to  the  mission  of  the  facility.
Q3. How does this contribute to establishment of a leadership class computer?
A3. The  computers  being  currently  installed  at  the  Leadership  Computing  Facility
(a  20  teraflop  Cray  X1e  and  a  25  teraflop  Cray  Xt3  or  Red  Storm)  are  two  of  the
largest systems available for open science in the U.S. The decision to allocate these
resources  to  a  limited  number  of  competitively  selected  teams  will  enhance  the  fa-
cility’s ability to enable leadership class science.
Q4. How  does  the  Department  justify  the  newly  proposed  ‘‘Research  and  Evaluation
Prototypes,’’  funded  at  $13.2  million,  a  ‘‘new  start’’  in  FY06  when  the  budget
also  includes  a  significant  cut  to  the  Center  for  Computational  Sciences,  an  es-
tablished program?

A4. The  research  and  evaluation  prototype  activity,  previously  referred  to  as  Ad-
vanced  Computing  Research  Testbeds,  has  been  a  part  of  the  Advanced  Scientific
Computing Research budget for a number of years. In FY 2005 Oak Ridge National
Laboratory will complete the evaluations that were funded in prior years. Therefore,
we  will  solicit  proposals  for  new  research  and  evaluation  prototypes  in  FY  2006.
This type of activity was strongly endorsed in the Federal Plan for High End Com-
puting,  which  was  published  by  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  last
May. These systems complement our investments in the Leadership Computing Fa-
cility  at  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  because  they  enable  us  to  evaluate  future
systems. In a technology area like computing, where new computers are introduced
every two years, it is critical to evaluate future systems in order to understand what
systems should be installed at facilities like the Leadership Computing Facility and
the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center.

Genomes to Life
Q5. The  constrained  budgets  DOE  will  face  in  the  coming  fiscal  years  are  already

affecting operations of existing user facilities.
Will  DOE  reconsider  the  scale  and  scope  of  the  four  Genomes  to  Life  start-up
facilities, so that the cost of each is reduced?

A5. Yes.  We  have  recently  engaged  the  National  Academies  in  a  scientific  assess-
ment  of  our  current  plans  for  the  Genomics:  GTL  program.  Among  several  topics,
they  have  been  asked  to  address  the  scientifically  appropriate  scope  and  scale  for
facility component of the Genomics: GTL effort.

Question submitted by Representative Al Green
Q1. I  notice  in  your  testimony  that  there  is  a  strong  focus,  in  terms  of  funding,  on

the President’s initiatives.

How much of a role does that play in your requests for the funding of activities
and have you found any major divergent visions between your particular sectors
and the Administration’s initiatives?

A1. The Office of Science (SC) budget funds presidential initiatives in hydrogen and
fusion (ITER). The Office fully funds all of the President’s initiatives, subject to Con-
gressional  appropriation,  and  has  found  these  Presidential  initiatives  in  line  with
the  science-driven  priorities  outlined  in  SC’s  20-year  Facilities  for  the  Future  docu-
ment.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Douglas  L.  Faulkner,  Principal  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Energy

Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy, Washington, DC

Questions submitted by Chairman Judy Biggert
Q1. In  both  your  written  and  oral  testimony,  you  emphasized  standards-setting  for
buildings, appliances, and equipment as a priority for the Building Technologies
Program in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The program
has not submitted several final rules for new and amended appliance standards
that  were  required  by  the  Energy  Policy  Act.  While  it  is  good  news  that  several
rules  are  going  to  be  issued  in  2005,  the  backlog  would  make  it  seem  unwise
to  be  cutting  the  budgets  for  this  important  program.  Are  these  efforts  resource-
constrained?  What  would  it  take  for  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  to  issue
final  rules  in  all  areas  which  it  was  overdue?  How  is  the  peer  review  require-
ment  recently  imposed  by  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  affecting  the
standards process at DOE?

A1. We  recognize  the  Department  has  missed  statutory  deadlines  for  a  number  of
rule-makings. Secretary Bodman has testified regarding the importance of resolving
this issue. We continue to undertake an annual priority-setting process to determine
which  of  these  rule-makings  should  be  allocated  resources  during  the  coming  year;
we are working diligently to complete the priority rule-makings and expect to issue
rules  for  these  products  as  soon  as  possible.  Our  efforts  are  not  resource-con-
strained; the reduced level of funding for these activities requested for FY 2006 will
have  no  impact  on  these  priority  rule-makings.  However,  the  process  for  issuing
rules  is  lengthy  and  burdensome,  including  substantial  periods  for  public  comment
that can slow the process.

To  issue  all  final  rules  that  are  overdue,  the  Department  would  have  to  signifi-
cantly accelerate its processes. Yet, some overdue rules are no longer of significance
to  industry  or  the  public,  while  others  are  of  great  importance.  We  will  continue  to
focus on the highest-priority rules.

We  expect  that  the  peer  review  requirements  imposed  by  the  Office  of  Manage-
ment  and  Budget  will  have  little  impact  on  rule-making  schedules;  we  will  conduct
the peer review of the appliance standards concurrent with the preparation and re-
view of Notices of Proposed Rule-making.
Q2. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) has noted that
small  changes  in  demand  for  energy  can  result  in  much  larger  drops  in  energy
prices. They have estimated that a five percent reduction in demand for natural
gas could cause a 20 percent drop in price. Your testimony refers to ‘‘the Depart-
ment’s  focus  on  longer-term,  high-risk  activities.’’  However,  the  White  House
guidance  to  agencies  for  research  and  development  (Memorandum  04–23)  also
calls for investments that ‘‘support technological innovation to enhance economic
competitiveness  and  new  job  creation.’’  Given  the  large  public  benefits  of  the
price  drop  modeled  by  ACEEE  (around  $25  billion  per  year),  and  the  high  en-
ergy  prices  today,  is  there  a  need  to  focus  more  of  DOE’s  research  and  develop-
ment effort on nearer-term energy efficiency goals? What contribution to our pre-
dicted  energy  demand  could  be  made  by  an  investment  in  efficiency  and  renew-
able energy of one-fifth of this benefit over the next three years?

A2. The  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy’s  (EERE) portfolio of
research and development (R&D) efforts focuses on achieving a diverse mix of
near-, mid-, and long-term benefits. Although near-term benefits may seem particu-
larly  attractive  during  a  time  of  high  energy  prices,  it  is  critical  to  maintain  an
array of technologies that will reap benefits into the future.

We  have  not  conducted  an  analysis  to  determine  the  level  of  public  benefits,  in-
cluding  reductions  in  energy  demand,  that  would  likely  result  from  increasing  the
budget  of  EERE  to  $5  billion  over  three  years  ($1.66  billion  per  year).  With  R&D,
benefit estimation provides decision-makers with a useful indication of relative ben-
efits  rather  than  absolute  benefits.  To  have  a  larger  near-term  impact,  the  invest-
ment  should  be  targeted  at  implementing  energy  efficiency  projects,  not  R&D.  It  is
generally the role of industry to make such investments, and, absent a market fail-
ure, industry will usually do just that if price signals indicate that the projects will
be sufficiently profitable.

In  his  2005  State  of  the  Union  Address,  the  President  underscored  the  need  to
restrain  spending  in  order  to  sustain  our  economic  prosperity.  As  part  of  this  re-
straint,  it  is  important  that  total  discretionary  and  non-security  spending  be  held

to  levels  proposed  in  the  FY  2006  Budget.  The  budget  savings  and  reforms  in  the
Budget  are  important  components  of  achieving  the  President’s  goal  of  cutting  the
budget  deficit  in  half  by  2009  and  we  urge  the  Congress  to  support  these  reforms.
Regardless  of  EERE’s  funding  level,  our  primary  long-term  goal  remains  to  signifi-
cantly reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to develop the technologies that en-
able  Americans  to  make  greater  and  more  efficient  use  of  our  abundant,  clean,  do-
mestic renewable energy resources.

Question submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. Over  the  years,  DOE’s  Industrial  Technologies  (IT)  Program  has  helped  make
manufacturers  in  my  state  and  rest  of  the  country  more  competitive  in  global
markets  which  creating  good-paying  jobs.  The  IT  program  is  meeting  its  goals
of  reduced  dependence  on  foreign  energy,  reduced  environmental  impact,  job
growth and retention. I am concerned to find that the program faces deep budget
cuts  at  DOE,  from  $91  million  in  2004  to  a  requested  level  of  $57  million  for
Fiscal Year 2006. Why is the Administration cutting back on its requests for this
successful public-private partnership program?

A1. Because  industry  is  less  likely  to  invest  in  R&D  toward  long-term  energy-sav-
ings  technologies,  our  Industrial  Technologies  Program  focuses  on  a  fewer  number
of higher-risk, higher-reward technologies, and our budget reflects that. Fortunately,
the  industrial  sector  of  the  economy  is  already  quite  energy  efficient,  since  it  has
an economic incentive and the financial means to reduce energy use as a component
of its overall cost of production.

Questions submitted by Representative Al Green
Q1. The  proposed  budget  seems  to  de-emphasize  the  necessity  for  energy  efficiency
and  renewable  energy  by  continuing  to  reduce  funding  for  energy  efficiency  and
renewable energy research and development (R&D), with the exception of activi-
ties  supporting  the  Administration’s  hydrogen  initiatives.  Renewable  Energy
R&D  funding,  excluding  the  Hydrogen  fuel  initiative,  has  seen  a  13  percent  re-
duction  and  Energy  Efficiency  R&D  (excluding  fuel  cells)  is  projected  to  have  a
15  percent  reduction.  I  noticed  in  your  written  testimony  that  the  attempt  is  to
focus ‘‘R&D on long-term, high-payoff activities that require federal involvement
to be successful.’’
What  other  criteria  does  DOE  use  to  prioritize  its  energy  efficiency  and  renew-
able energy initiatives?

A1. The Department of Energy (DOE) prioritizes its activities in alignment with the
National Energy Policy and the Department of Energy’s Strategic Plan. In addition,
DOE  utilizes  models  that  estimate  the  potential  benefits  of  portfolio  choices.  DOE
also  uses  principles  contained  within  the  President’s  Management  Agenda  (PMA),
the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget’s  Program  Assessment  and  Rating  Tool
(PART),  and  the  Research  and  Development  Investment  Criteria  (RDIC)  to  inform
budget decisions and guide management improvements.
Q2. The  proposed  budget  seems  to  de-emphasize  the  necessity  for  energy  efficiency
and  renewable  energy  by  continuing  to  reduce  funding  for  energy  efficiency  and
renewable energy research and development (R&D), with the exception of activi-
ties  supporting  the  Administration’s  hydrogen  initiatives.  Renewable  Energy
R&D  funding,  excluding  the  Hydrogen  fuel  initiative,  has  seen  a  13  percent  re-
duction  and  Energy  Efficiency  R&D  (excluding  fuel  cells)  is  projected  to  have  a
15  percent  reduction.  I  noticed  in  your  written  testimony  that  the  attempt  is  to
focus ‘‘R&D on long-term, high-payoff activities that require federal involvement
to be successful.’’
Why  do  you  believe  that  there  is  such  a  focus  on  the  Administration’s  hydrogen
initiatives rather than other near-term technologies such as solar, wind, and hy-
dropower energy?

A2. Reducing, or even eliminating, our nation’s dependence on foreign oil is the top
priority  of  the  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  (EERE).  Our  re-
quested funding levels for programs that can directly reduce transportation oil con-
sumption, such as the Hydrogen, Fuel Cells & Infrastructure Technologies Program,
reflect that high priority. In addition, the FY 2006 funding requests for solar energy
and wind energy are only slightly below (one percent and two percent, respectively)
their  2005  appropriation  levels.  The  lower  request  for  hydropower  reflects  the  De-

partment’s decision to close out its hydropower R&D work in the absence of any sig-
nificant remaining market barriers that would justify continued federal investment.
Q3. The  proposed  budget  seems  to  de-emphasize  the  necessity  for  energy  efficiency
and  renewable  energy  by  continuing  to  reduce  funding  for  energy  efficiency  and
renewable energy research and development (R&D), with the exception of activi-

15  percent  reduction.  I  noticed  in  your  written  testimony  that  the  attempt  is  to
focus ‘‘R&D on long-term, high-payoff activities that require federal involvement
to be successful.’’
I noticed in your testimony that there has been a strong focus, in terms of fund-
ing,  on  the  President’s  initiatives.  How  much  of  a  role  does  that  play  in  your
request  for  the  funding  of  activities,  and  have  you  found  any  major  divergent
visions between your particular sector and the Administration’s initiatives?

A3. As  an  integral  component  of  the  Administration,  the  Department  shares  the
President’s  vision  and  carries  out  activities  to  support  that  vision,  including  Presi-
dential initiatives.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Mark  R.  Maddox,  Principal  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Fossil  En-

ergy, Department of Energy, Washington, DC

Questions submitted by Chairman Judy Biggert
Q1. The President’s fiscal year 2006 (FY06) budget request proposes to rescind $257
million from the Clean Coal account, and advance-appropriate the same amount
in  Fiscal  FY07,  dedicated  to  the  FutureGen  project.  Such  a  change  would  move
the  project  into  an  account  with  fewer  statutory  protections  against  cost  over-
runs.  Why  is  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  proposing  to  move  this  funding
between accounts? Is there a concern about potential overruns?

A1. The  President’s  fiscal  year  2006  budget  proposes  to  rescind  $257  million  from
the Clean Coal account and advance-appropriate the same amount to FutureGen in
the FY 2007 budget. This proposal would move remaining prior-year funds from ter-
minated  clean  coal  demonstration  projects  to  an  account  specific  to  FutureGen,  a
large-scale  research  project.  Forward-funding  the  FutureGen  project  for  several
years  is  an  indication  of  the  government’s  serious  commitment  to  the  FutureGen
project. With regard to potential cost overruns, it is our intent to exercise tight con-
trols  over  cost  and  schedules  using  strong  management  principles  and  practices  in
keeping with the general project management guidelines of the Department.
Q2. The  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  has  chosen  a  unique  management  structure  for  the
FutureGen  project.  As  I  understand  it,  the  structure  would  create  a  private-sec-
tor  consortium  to  manage  both  oversight  and  operations.  Is  the  proposed  man-
agement  approach  to  large  demonstration  projects  such  as  FutureGen  the  right
mechanism  to  ensure  efficient  operation  and  oversight  of  federally-funded
projects? Please explain the role of the project integrator and how that approach
is  better  for  public  purposes.  What  is  the  liability  of  the  Federal  Government  in
the  event  that  the  private-sector  partners  walk  away  from  the  project  before  the
demonstration is complete?

A2. The  Department  of  Energy  has  chosen  a  project  structure  for  FutureGen  that
is  not  unique,  but  one  which  has  been  employed  with  similar  projects  that  have
been  cost-shared  between  government  and  industry.  The  implementation  of  the
FutureGen  project  through  a  cooperative  agreement  with  an  industry  consortium
was  one  of  many  methods  studied  to  determine  how  best  to  proceed  with  meeting
the  need  for  a  zero  emission  coal-based  power  plant.  After  all  methods  were  thor-
oughly studied, DOE concluded that a cooperative agreement with an industry con-
sortium  was  the  preferred  and  most  efficient  mechanism  available  to  ensure  that
the  goals  of  the  FutureGen  research  project  would  be  met.  One  of  the  chief  goals
of  the  FutureGen  project  is  replication  of  zero  emission  clean  coal  technology  once
the  technical  feasibility  and  economic  viability  of  the  project  has  been  proven.  For
this reason, significant participation from the coal utilities and technology providers
who  we  expect  to  carry  out  those  replications  is  essential,  and  partnering  closely
with  these  private-sector  entities  is  appropriate.  The  project  will  be  managed  with
distinct budget periods that limit the liability of all parties for each period and will
adhere to the Department’s comprehensive project management guidelines for major
projects  regarding  Critical  Decision  approvals  by  the  Department’s  energy  systems
acquisition review board. While any partner can discontinue participation at the end
of  a  budget  period,  currently  the  liability  of  the  Federal  Government  would  be  lim-
ited  to  the  monies  invested  up  to  that  point  and  offset  by  the  government’s  owner-
ship of any residual assets to which it was entitled.
Q3. The  FY06  budget  request  indicates  that  over  65  percent  of  the  cost  of  the
FutureGen project would come from the Federal Government ($620 million of the
$950  million).  The  Energy  Policy  Act  of  1992  requires  that  demonstration  pro-
grams  receive  no  more  than  50  percent  of  their  funding  from  federal  sources.
Does  the  proposed  budget  for  FutureGen  follow  the  requirements  in  law  that
demonstration  projects  be  costs  shared,  with  industry  contributing  a  minimum
of fifty percent of the cost of the project?

A3. The  FutureGen  Project  is  an  advanced  demonstration  project  that  will  attempt
to  integrate  cutting-edge  technologies  and  components,  some  of  which  are  not  cur-
rently  ready  for  full-scale  demonstration.  The  approximate  overall  cost-share  per-
centages  are  26  percent  from  industry,  65  percent  from  the  government,  and  nine
percent  from  International  contributions.  However,  not  all  portions  of  the  project
will be cost shared at the same level. Consistent with the Fiscal Year 2004 and 2005

99

Appropriations  language,  the  Federal  Government  will  maintain  a  50  percent  cost-
share  from  non-federal  sources  on  any  component  of  the  project  that  would  be  con-
sidered as demonstration. Less will be sought for portions with technology not ready
for full-scale demonstration, such as carbon sequestration.
Q4. Natural  gas  prices  are  at  all-time  highs,  and  the  chemical  industry  has  been
cutting  production  in  the  U.S.  in  response  to  those  prices.  Gasification  of  coal
creates a synthetic mix of gases, often called syngas, which can be used in many
of the same processes as natural gas. If large-scale gasification were in place in
the  U.S.  today,  coal  could  serve  as  a  stabilizing  force  on  natural  gas  prices.
What  is  DOE  doing  to  promote  the  use  of  coal  gasification  as  a  substitute  for
natural gas?

A4. The  Department  of  Energy’s  clean  coal  research  program,  in  partnership  with
U.S.  industry,  is  conducting  research,  development,  and  demonstration  activities  to
improve the performance and reduce the costs of advanced gasification systems. Re-
search  on  these  advanced  gasification  technologies  is  aimed  at  low-cost,  reliable
methods of gasifying a variety of coals into a synthesis gas (syngas) that can be used
in  an  integrated  gasification  system  to  co-produce  electricity,  high  value  chemicals
and  fuels  (hydrogen),  or  converting  the  syngas  into  methane  as  an  alternative  fuel
to  natural  gas.  For  example,  relatively  inexpensive  domestic  feedstocks  such  as  lig-
nite  coal  can  be  gasified  to  produce  a  synthetic  gas.  This  synthetic  methane  as  an
alternative  to  natural  gas  is  currently  being  produced  by  the  Dakota  Gasification
plant in Beulah, North Dakota.

The  coal  gasification  program  includes  research  on  low-cost,  fuel-flexible,  longer
life  refractory  materials;  advanced  oxygen  membrane  technology  with  lower  costs
and  improved  efficiency;  low-cost,  ultra-clean  gas  stream  cleanup  systems;  designs
for gasifiers that operate more efficiently on low rank coals; and advanced catalysts
for producing hydrogen and synthesis gas in shift reactors. These activities will en-
able  us  to  use  coal  to  produce  power,  from  efficient  hydrogen  turbines,  and  high
value fuel and chemical products. For the longer-term, the coal gasification program
is  a  key  element  in  the  effort  to  develop  advanced  technologies  for  efficient,  near-
zero atmospheric emissions coal plants that are fuel flexible, and affordable.

Question submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. I am concerned about the future of manufacturing in the U.S. As you well know,
our  natural  gas  prices  are  the  highest  in  the  world  and  are  beginning  to  price
U.S. companies out of global markets. I would like to know what DOE is doing
to stimulate new energy technologies. I am told by business people in my district
that coal gasification technology holds great promise. They tell me lignite, mined
in  my  district,  can  be  converted  in  to  a  form  of  gas  that  can  be  used  to  make
chemicals, electricity, and even ultra-clean form of diesel fuel. It strikes me that
gasification  may  have  the  potential  to  save  natural  gas  and  U.S.  jobs.  What  is
DOE doing to help make this technological promise a reality?

A1. The Department of Energy, in partnership with U.S. industry, is conducting re-
search,  development,  and  demonstration  activities  to  improve  the  performance  and
reduce  the  costs  of  advanced  systems  that  produce  power,  fuels  (hydrogen),  and
chemicals  from  coal  and  alternative  fuels  (biomass).  The  Coal  Gasification  Program
is  a  key  element  of  efforts  to  develop  advanced  technologies  for  efficient,  near-zero
atmospheric emissions coal plants that are fuel flexible, and affordable.

There  are  a  number  of  gasifiers  that  have  been  designed  to  accommodate  a  vari-
ety  of  specific  coals  (and  other  feedstock)  including  low-rank  coals  such  as  lignite.
Lignite  is  a  good  example  of  a  relatively  inexpensive  domestic  feedstock  that  can
be  gasified  to  produce  a  synthetic  gas.  This  synthetic  methane  as  an  alternative  to
natural gas is currently being produced by the Dakota Gasification plant in Buelah,
North Dakota.

The  Gasification  Program  includes  research  on  low-cost,  fuel-flexible,  longer  life
refractory  materials;  advanced  oxygen  membrane  technology  with  lower  costs  and
improved  efficiency;  low-cost,  ultra-clean  gas  stream  cleanup  systems;  designs  for
gasifiers that operate more efficiently on low rank coals; and advanced catalysts for
producing  hydrogen  and  synthesis  gas  in  shift  reactors.  These  activities  will  enable
us  to  use  coal  to  produce  power,  from  efficient  hydrogen  turbines,  and  high  value
fuel and chemical products from coal.

Overall, the research that we are pursuing is focused on making gasification more
competitive by developing advanced technologies that will lower its capital cost and
reduce  risk,  and  position  coal  gasification  to  be  compatible  with  the  capture  of  car-

bon  dioxide  for  the  future.  It  is  anticipated  that  this  effort  could  improve  the  com-
petitiveness of gasification systems being marketed by major vendors today.

Question submitted by Representative Bob Inglis
Q1. The Administration’s budget request for Distributed Generation—Fuel Cells pro-
vides  that  funding  in  the  Solid  State  Energy  Conversion  Alliance  (SECA)  pro-
gram  will  be  used  to  ‘‘continue  MW-scale  SECA  fuel  cell  and  fuel  cell  hybrids
work.’’  What  activities  in  this  area  do  you  envision  in  FY06,  and  what  is  the
Department’s plan for this program beyond FY06?

A1. The  current  strategy  is  to  develop  clean  high  efficiency  fossil  fueled  power
plants:  Immediate  near-term  (2006–2007)—validate  successful  Solid  State  Energy
Conversion Alliance (SECA) Phase I achievements and initiate Phase II SECA low-
cost,  3–10  kilowatt  solid-state  fuel  cell  modules  for  distributed  and  auxiliary  power
unit  applications.  Validation  of  target  achievements  will  be  done  via  testing  of  the
first prototype fuel cells to confirm the first plateau of performance (current density,
hours of operation) and analyzing the design and cost reduction potential using the
system  components.  If  the  fuel  cell  prototype  passes  the  first  ‘‘gate’’  it  will  qualify
for  a  second  phase  development  aimed  at  further  performance  improvements  and
cost  reduction  designs  that  will  be  tested  and  analyzed  at  the  end  of  the  second
phase.  Mid-term  (2007–2010)—develop  and  test  SECA  fuel  cell  prototype  modules
capable  of  manufacture  of  $400  per  kilowatt  (a  ten-fold  reduction  from  fuel  cells
available  in  2000);  and  Long-term  (2010–2015)—scale-up  and  demonstrate  the  crit-
ical high risk technology advancements which will permit U.S. industry to establish
commercial  availability  of  advanced,  low-cost,  ultra-high  efficiency,  fuel  flexible,  in-
tegrated  fuel  cell  and  fuel  cell/turbine  hybrids  systems  for  synfuel  and  hydrogen-
based plants. Fuel cell systems have specifically identified goals which coincide with
coal-based and other fuel-flexible zero emissions power modules and concepts in the
2010 to 2015 time frame.

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. DOE  recently  released  a  series  of  reports  indicating  the  potential  to  recover  43
billion  barrels  of  additional  domestic  oil  through  the  use  of  carbon  dioxide-en-
hanced  oil  recovery.  This  is  a  technology  that  has  received  considerable  federal
research attention in the past and the release suggested the importance of addi-
tional research to apply the technology in these other areas.
• So,  faced  with  the  opportunity  to  produce  an  additional  43  billion  barrels  of
oil in the United States, as I understand the Administration’s budget request,
why does the Administration recommend that this research be terminated?

A1. The decision to terminate the oil and gas research programs reflects a strategic
assessment  of  the  programs  compared  to  other  DOE  programs.  This  is  in  line  with
our commitment to deliver results for the American taxpayer.

Much of the Department’s oil and natural gas research is jointly funded by indus-
try  and  the  government.  It  was  determined  that  the  industry  has  the  capacity  to
pursue this research, especially in light of the current strong economic performance
of the industry.
Q2. In  2003,  the  Secretary’s  advisory  group—the  National  Petroleum  Council—
looked at natural gas supply and demand challenges over the next 25 years. The
Supply  Task  Group  recommended  that  from  2003  to  2010,  public  money  from
government  agencies  such  as  the  DOE  or  Joint  Industry  Partners  made  up  of
both government and industry partners should continue doing the research and
technology  development  in  gas  hydrates.  Under  the  Administration’s  budget  re-
quest,  there  would  be  no  federal  money  available  to  conduct  further  research  or
joint  projects  envisioned  by  these  experts—a  group  chaired  by  a  major  oil  com-
pany.
• How  does  the  Administration’s  budget  request  square  with  the  advice  of  its

own Petroleum Council?

A2. The  Administration  believes  that  the  Energy  Bill  requested  by  the  President
will stimulate research and technology development by industry. In addition, recent
high oil and gas prices provide an added incentive to substantially increase private
R&D investments in gas hydrates.
Q3. It is my understanding that the DOE oil and natural gas research and develop-
ment  (R&D)  are  largely  cost  shared  in  about  equal  amounts.  Many  of  the  con-

tributors  are  universities  where  the  projects  are  used  to  fund  graduate  student
in petroleum engineering or petroleum geology programs. Separately, the Depart-
ment  of  Labor  has  initiated  an  effort  to  address  the  labor  challenges  in  the  oil
and natural gas exploration and production industry—including both rig work-
ers and engineers and geologists.
• Did the Administration solicit comments from these universities funding part-
ners  on  the  consequences  of  terminating  these  R&D  functions  and  on  their
ability to maintain their engineering and geology programs without continued
DEO funding?

• What do you believe the consequences will be if these programs are terminated?
A3. Budget  discipline  necessitated  close  scrutiny  of  all  Fossil  Energy  programs,
using  strict  guidelines  to  determine  their  effectiveness  and  compare  them  to  other
programs  offering  more  clearly  demonstrated  and  substantial  benefits.  University
funding partners were not consulted on this strategic decision.

Much of the Department’s oil and natural gas research is jointly funded by indus-
try  and  the  government.  It  was  determined  that  the  industry  has  the  capacity  to
pursue this research, especially in light of the current strong economic performance
of the industry.

Research Capabilities of Integrated Oil Companies
Q4. I’m told that only companies with significant research capabilities are the major

integrated oil companies.
• Can  you  tell  us  how  much  of  current  U.S.  enhance  oil  production—outside  of

Alaska—comes from the companies that have large research capabilities?
• How likely is it that these companies would direct research to these areas?
• If  they  were  to  conduct  the  research,  how  likely  is  it  that  these  companies

would share the technology with other enhanced oil producers?

A4. An  analysis  of  industry  R&D  spending  (1997–2000),  reported  by  the  Interstate
Oil  and  Gas  Compact  Commission,  showed  that  the  oil  and  gas  service  industry
spent  $631  million  per  year  on  R&D,  about  17  percent  higher  than  the  spending
of energy producers ($540 million per year, 1997–2000). The Department expects the
service  industry  to  continue  to  provide  technological  innovations  for  use  by  major
and  independent  producers,  including  companies  engaging  in  enhanced  oil  produc-
tion.

Questions submitted by Representative Jerry F. Costello

$2 Billion Commitment to Coal
Q1. The  DOE  is  currently  conducting  a  ten-year,  $2.0  billion  program,  the  Presi-
dent’s ‘‘Clean Coal Power Initiative’’ (CCPI) which is intended to cost share with
the  industry  the  demonstration  of  clean  coal  technologies  that  are  ‘‘ready  to  go’’
today.  DOE  requested  $50  million  for  the  CCPI  program  in  FY06.  Is  the  DOE
fully committed to funding the CCPI program at $2 billion over 10 years?

A1. The Fiscal Year 2006 budget supports the Department’s continuing effort to ful-
fill President Bush’s 10-year $2 billion commitment to clean coal research with fund-
ing for the President’s Coal Research Initiative (CRI) of $286 million, a $13 million
increase  over  the  2005  enacted  level.  The  2006  Budget  brings  the  total  requested
funding for clean coal research to $1.6 billion over five years, on pace to exceed the
President’s ten-year pledge by more than 50 percent.

The President’s Coal Research Initiative is made up of the Clean Coal Power Ini-
tiative  (CCPI)  as  well  as  FutureGen,  and  Coal  Technology  Research  and  Develop-
ment  (which  includes  Sequestration,  Fuels,  Emissions  Control,  Coal  Gasification,
Turbines and Advanced Research and Development).
Q2. The  DOE  is  currently  conducting  a  ten-year,  $2.0  billion  program,  the  Presi-
dent’s  ‘‘clean  coal  power  initiative’’  (CCPI)  which  is  intended  to  cost  share  with
industry  the  demonstration  of  clean  coal  technologies  that  are  ‘‘ready  to  go’’
today. DOE requested $50 million for the CCPI program in FY06.
If  there  is  to  be  a  third  CCPI  solicitation  in  FY07,  will  the  Department  be  re-
questing an additional $250 million for FY07 to get the total dollars in the third
solicitation  to  the  $300  million  level,  which  has  been  the  amount  in  each  of  the
first two solicitations?

A2. The  Administration’s  FY  2007  budget  has  not  been  finalized  yet.  The  Depart-
ment  is  in  the  initial  planning  stages  for  CCPI  Round  3,  which  will  demonstrate
advanced technologies currently being developed, such as integrated advanced clean-
up technologies that include mercury controls, and advanced next generation power
technologies  that  are  carbon  sequestration  compatible.  Specific  goals  and  a  time-
frame  for  Round  3  have  not  been  determined  at  this  time  and  will  depend  on  tech-
nology developments and future budgetary considerations.
Q3. The  DOE  is  currently  conducting  a  ten  year,  $2.0  billion  program,  the  Presi-
dent’s  ‘‘clean  coal  power  initiative’’  (CCPI)  which  is  intended  to  cost  share  with
industry  the  demonstration  of  clean  coal  technologies  that  are  ‘‘ready  to  go’’
today. DOE requested $50 million for the CCPI program in FY06.
Will the funds appropriated for this demonstration program be used strictly for
the CCPI program or will it be split with the FutureGen Initiative?

A3. The funds appropriated for the Clean Coal Power Initiative demonstration pro-
gram  will  be  used  strictly  for  CCPI  demonstration  projects.  The  FutureGen  Initia-
tive  is  funded  directly  from  its  own  budget  line  item.  In  the  Administration’s  FY
2006  Request,  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative  demonstrations  are  budgeted  at  $50
million,  and  the  FutureGen  project  is  budgeted  at  $18  million,  with  a  request  for
advanced  appropriation  of  $257  million  to  be  used  for  FutureGen  in  FY  2007  and
beyond.

Question submitted by Representative Al Green
Q1. I  notice  in  your  testimony  that  there  has  been  a  strong  focus,  in  terms  of  fund-
ing,  on  the  President’s  Initiatives.  How  much  of  a  role  does  that  play  in  your
request  for  the  funding  of  activities,  and  have  you  found  any  major  divergent
visions between your particular sectors and the Administration’s initiatives?

A1. The  Department  of  Energy  is  an  executive  branch  agency.  We  are  responsible
for carrying out the President’s Initiatives. In formulating the budget, the Adminis-
tration  has  to  balance  many  priorities.  The  funding  requested  for  these  programs
is consistent with the President’s overall management goals. There are no major di-
vergent visions between the Department and the Administration.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Robert  Shane  Johnson,  Deputy  Director  for  Technology,  Office  of  Nu-
clear  Energy,  Science,  and  Technology,  Department  of  Energy,  Washington,  DC

Questions submitted by Chairman Judy Biggert

Impact of Idaho National Laboratory Reorganization on R&D Programs
Q1. How  will  the  reorganization  of  the  Idaho  laboratory  complex  affect  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy’s  (DOE’S)  overall  nuclear  energy  research  and  development
(R&D) program? What role will other national laboratories with significant nu-
clear  expertise,  such  as  Argonne  National  Laboratory,  play  in  nuclear  energy
R&D  after  Idaho  National  Laboratory  begins  operations?  Does  the  Department
plan to phase out nuclear research at other laboratories?

A1. The reorganization of the Idaho complex is intended to facilitate and strengthen
the  Department’s  long-term  vision  for  the  Idaho  National  Laboratory  (INL)  to  be-
come  the  Nation’s  leading  center  of  excellence  for  nuclear  energy  research  and  de-
velopment (R&D). INL’s focus on the development of advanced nuclear technologies
will  provide  significant  improvements  in  sustainability,  economic,  safety  and  reli-
ability,  and  non-proliferation  and  resistance  to  attack.  However,  the  Department
recognizes  that  many  other  national  laboratories  have  well-established  areas  of  ex-
pertise  in  multiple  nuclear  technology  disciplines,  and  some  laboratories  have
unique test facilities. DOE intends to continue to use these valuable assets in mov-
ing ahead with our nuclear energy R&D programs.
Background:

• There are three advanced nuclear energy research programs within the Office
of  Nuclear  Energy,  Science  and  Technology  that  fund  R&D  at  the  national
laboratories:  Generation  IV  Nuclear  Energy  Systems  Initiative  (Generation
IV),  Nuclear  Hydrogen  Initiative  (NHI),  and  Advanced  Fuel  Cycle  Initiative
(AFCI).

• The  national  laboratories  engaged  in  nuclear  energy  R&D  and  the  programs

they support are listed below:

Æ Argonne National Laboratory—East: Generation IV, NHI, AFCI
Æ Argonne National Laboratory—West: Generation IV, NHI, AFCI
Æ Brookhaven National Laboratory—AFCI
Æ Idaho  National  Engineering  and  Environmental  Laboratory—Generation

IV, NHI, AFCI

Æ Los Alamos National Laboratory—AFCI
Æ Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory—Generation IV, AFCI
Æ Oak Ridge National Laboratory—Generation IV, NHI, AFCI

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. In  the  1970s  and  early  1980s,  the  domestic  nuclear  industry  provided  virtually
100  percent  of  the  design,  construction,  fabrication,  fuel  and  other  needs  of  our
nuclear infrastructure.
• What  percent  of  uranium  fueling  our  reactors  comes  from  the  U.S.  mines  at

present?

• How many of the original domestic reactor design companies are left?
• Is  it  indeed  the  case  that  other  countries  such  as  France,  Britain,  Russia  and

Japan either own and/or heavily subsidize their own nuclear industry?

• Under  these  circumstances  how  difficult  is  it  for  domestic  companies  to  com-

pete internationally or even within our own borders for nuclear business?

• Does  DOE  have  any  policy  taking  action  to  support  the  domestic  nuclear  sup-

ply and technology industry?

A1. According  to  the  Energy  Information  Administration,  U.S.  uranium  production
from  mines  in  2004  was  2.5  million  pounds,  or  about  five  percent  of  the  51  million
pounds  uranium  equivalent  contained  in  fuel  assemblies  loaded  into  U.S.  reactors
during  2004.  Of  the  five  original  reactor  vendors  in  the  United  States  (Westing-
house,  General  Electric,  Babcock  &  Wilcox,  Combustion  Engineering  and  General
Atomics),  only  Combustion  Engineering  no  longer  remains.  General  Electric  and
Westinghouse are focused on light water reactor technology, while General Atomics
is working on gas-cooled reactors and Babcock & Wilcox offers nuclear power equip-
ment.  Westinghouse’s  nuclear  business  is  located  in  the  U.S.  but  is  wholly  owned
by British Nuclear Fuels, Limited, a company based in the United Kingdom.

Governments  own  all  or  a  majority  of  the  nuclear  industries  in  France,  Britain
and Russia, although attempts to privatize companies are in early stages in France
and Britain. Private Japanese companies control most of the reactor design and nu-
clear fuel industries in Japan. The governments of France, Japan, and Russia heav-
ily  subsidize  the  commercial  nuclear  technology  and  fuel  research  and  development
activities,  and  support  their  domestic  company’s  nuclear  technology  marketing  and
sales  to  other  countries.  This  type  of  support  puts  U.S.-based  reactor  vendors  at  a
competitive disadvantage when competing globally for the sale of new nuclear power
plants. Uranium mining, conversion, and enrichment are more of a commodity busi-
ness than designing and engineering reactors.

Given the importance of this industry, however, the U.S. has provided strong sup-
port for the domestic nuclear supply and technology industry. The Department initi-
ated the Nuclear Power 2010 program, in part, to demonstrate the untested federal
licensing processes for siting, building, and operating new nuclear power plants. Ad-
ditionally,  the  Nuclear  Power  2010  program  supports  reactor  vendor  activities  to
successfully  accomplish  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  certification  and  com-
pletion of ‘‘first-of-a-kind’’ engineering of their proposed advanced light water reactor
designs.  The  Department  is  supporting  the  development  and  certification  of  the
General Electric Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) and the Wes-
tinghouse  Advanced  Pressurized  Water  Reactor  (AP–1000)  reactor  designs  in  a  50–
50 cost-shared partnership with the nuclear industry.

In addition, the recently passed Energy Bill included a proposal by the President
to offer risk insurance for new nuclear power plant construction. Providing this risk
insurance  as  well  as  significant  support  for  nuclear  energy  research  and  develop-
ment  programs  has  helped  to  eliminate  barriers  facing  the  nuclear  energy  industry
and  will  help  make  U.S.  companies  even  more  competitive  with  foreign  suppliers.

Question submitted by Representative Al Green
Q1. I  notice  in  your  testimony  that  there  has  been  a  strong  focus,  in  terms  of  fund-

ing, on the President’s initiatives.
How much of a role does that play in your requests for the funding of activities,
and  have  you  found  any  major  divergent  visions  between  your  particular  sector
and the Administration’s initiatives?

A1. The Administration’s initiatives play a major role in the development of the De-
partment’s  budget  request.  Following  publication  of  the  ‘‘National  Energy  Policy,’’
the  Department  developed  a  Strategic  Plan  that  defines  its  mission  and  goals  for
accomplishing  that  mission.  The  Office  of  Nuclear  Energy,  Science  and  Technology
programs and budget requests support the Department’s goal to protect our national
and  economic  security  by  promoting  a  diverse  supply  of  reliable,  affordable,  and
emissions-free energy.

The  ‘‘National  Energy  Policy’’  and  the  Administration’s  initiatives  for  nuclear  en-
ergy are aligned with the Department’s programs to support the development of new
nuclear  generation  technologies  that  provide  significant  improvements  in  sustain-
ability, economics, safety and reliability, and nonproliferation. Specifically, the Gen-
eration  IV  Nuclear  Energy  Systems  Initiative  establishes  a  basis  for  expansive  co-
operation with our international partners to develop advanced reactor and fuel cycle
systems  that  represent  a  significant  leap  in  economic  performance,  safety,  and  pro-
liferation-resistance.  Through  the  Advanced  Fuel  Cycle  Initiative,  the  Department
seeks  to  develop  advanced,  proliferation  resistant  nuclear  fuel  technologies  that
maximize the energy produced from nuclear fuel while minimizing wastes. The Nu-
clear Power 2010 program supports intermediate-term research, technology develop-
ment  and  demonstration  activities  that  advance  the  ‘‘National  Energy  Policy’’  goals
for enhancing long-term U.S. energy independence and reliability and expanding the
contribution  of  nuclear  power  to  the  Nation’s  energy  portfolio.  In  addition,  the  Nu-
clear  Hydrogen  Initiative  will  develop  advanced  technologies  that  can  be  used  in
tandem  with  advanced  nuclear  energy  plants  to  generate  economic,  commercial

States.

The  Department  worked  closely  with  Congress  on  the  development  of  the  ‘‘Na-
tional  Energy  Policy.’’  The  nuclear  titles  of  the  policy  were  crafted  in  conjunction
with  experts  from  the  Department  and  thus  are  supportive  and  complementary  to
NE’s  vision.  Additionally,  as  noted  earlier,  the  Department’s  vision  for  nuclear  en-
ergy, science, and technology is fully aligned with that of the Administration.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Kevin M. Kolevar, Director of the Office of Electricity Delivery and En-

ergy Reliability, Department of Energy, Washington, DC

Question submitted by Chairman Judy Biggert
Q1. What is the rationale for the proposed reduction in the Fiscal Year 2006 budget
for  energy  storage,  given  the  likely  contribution  to  improving  grid  stability  and
enabling the connecting of intermittent sources (such as wind) to the grid?

A1. The  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2006  budget  request  for  the  Office  of  Electricity  Delivery
and  Energy  Reliability  (OE),  in  line  with  Presidential  priorities  and  budget  reduc-
tions,  has  been  reduced  by  $5.876  million  from  the  FY05  request.  Storage  was  one
of several R&D programs that, in light of budget constraints, were reduced in order
to fund higher priority activities. The FY06 budget request will provide funding sup-
port for those activities which the Administration believes are critical to DOE’s mis-
sion.

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. In your testimony you cite military propulsion and directed energy weapons ap-
plications  as  examples  of  the  application  of  high  temperature  superconductivity
wire developed through Department of Energy (DOE) research.
How  quickly  can  we  expect  to  see  this  technology  in  electric  transmission  and
distribution  systems?  What  barriers  need  to  be  overcome  in  order  for  this  re-
search to be ready for commercializing other non-military applications?

A1. We  are  beginning  to  see  the  impacts  of  high  temperature  superconductivity
technology on the electricity grid today. The FY 2006 Budget request supports dem-
onstrations,  in  partnership  with  electric  utilities  and  equipment  manufacturers,  of
first-of-a-kind  equipment  prototypes  in  operation  on  the  grid.  For  example,  three
complete,  integrated  systems  that  demonstrate  different  aspects  of  superconducting
cables  are  now  being  developed  in  partnership  with  American  Electric  Power,  Long
Island Power Authority and National Grid (Niagara Mohawk) for planned operation
and testing on electric grids in Ohio and New York. The time to market will be ac-
celerated  by  this  approach  which  provides  utilities  direct  experience  with  installa-
tion and operation of superconducting equipment as well as gaining the advantages
of  their  collaboration  in  designing  equipment  which  will  meet  their  needs  and  re-
quirements.  We  are  continuing  research  that  improves  the  performance  and  poten-
tial cost of future high temperature superconductivity grid equipment. This includes
technology  research  into  advanced  wire  materials  and  processes  to  enable  produc-
tion of long lengths of cost-competitive, superconducting wire.
Q2a. Describe  for  us  the  role  of  the  electric  utilities  in  the  development  with  DOE
of  the  real-time  monitoring  and  control  software  tools  and  system  operating
models  that  are  the  core  of  your  Transmission  Reliability  and  distribution  re-
search and development (R&D) programs.
What  problems,  if  any,  has  DOE  encountered  in  the  development  of  the  tech-
nologies and procedures for the Transmission Reliability program?

A2a. With  respect  to  electric  transmission,  reliability  is  enhanced  when  additional
lines  are  added  to  the  grid,  proper  maintenance  occurs  in  a  timely  manner,  and
when grid operators are able to make adjustments, in real-time, to address fluctua-
tions  in  system  conditions,  particularly  during  periods  of  peak  demand.  Real  time
grid reliability management is a key focus for the Transmission Reliability Program,
and  several  recent  accomplishments  designed  to  help  operators  recognize,  analyze
and  respond  to  system  anomalies  and  predict  performance  under  various  cir-
cumstances demonstrate this commitment. In fact, several analysts believe that the
tools being developed and deployed, including VAR-Voltage Management Tool, Area
Control  Error  (ACE)-Frequency  Real-Time  Monitoring  System,  and  Synchronized
Phasor Measurement Tools, could have limited the spread and may have prevented
the  August  14,  2003,  blackout  altogether  had  they  been  in  place  in  this  region.
Working with the Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS)
and industry partners, including Independent System Operators, DOE plans to con-
tinue the research, development and deployment of these monitoring and visualiza-
tion tools, enabling the region-wide sharing of real time information from measure-
ment technologies.

Q2b. What technology barriers to the integration of distributed energy resources into

electric distribution systems have you encountered?

A2b. The  mission  of  the  Electric  Distribution  Program  (which  refers  collectively  to
the  Electric  Distribution  Program  and  the  GridWise  Initiative)  is  to  transform  to-
day’s electric distribution infrastructure for increased affordability, reliability, secu-
rity,  and  resilience,  through  integration  of  advanced  communications,  information,
sensors,  controls,  and  distributed  energy  resources  (DER)  with  electric  power  sys-
tems. The central strategy employed by the Program to achieve its mission is a com-
prehensive  set  of  R&D  partnerships  involving  other  federal  programs,  State  pro-
grams, and the private sector.

One of the challenges that distributed energy resources encountered as they inte-
grated with the electric system was the need for consistent, objective, yet technically
sound,  connection  requirements  that  addressed  both  the  operational  needs  of  the
distributed  energy  resource,  but  also  the  safety  concerns  of  the  connecting  utility.
Thus, the Electric Distribution Program is partnering with the Institute of Electrical
and  Electronics  Engineers  (IEEE)  for  the  development  of  uniform  interconnection
standards,  IEEE  1547.  Organizational  and  technical  support  is  also  being  provided
to  develop  international  standards  via  the  International  Electrotechnical  Commis-
sion  Technical  Committee  8  (IEC  TC  8),  System  Aspects  of  Electrical  Energy  Sup-
ply.
Q2c. What  science  or  technical  breakthroughs  does  DOE  expect  to  make  with  the
storage program that will enable significant quantities of power to be available
to increase grid reliability and mitigate congestion problems?

A2c. Breakthroughs that reduce the costs of electricity storage systems could poten-
tially  drive  changes  in  the  design  and  operation  of  the  electric  power  system.  Peak
load  problems  could  be  reduced,  electrical  stability  could  be  improved,  and  power
quality disturbances could be eliminated. Storage can be applied at the power plant,
in support of the transmission system, at various points in the distribution system,
and  on  particular  appliances  and  equipment  on  the  customer’s  side  of  the  meter.
The  Energy  Storage  Program  performs  research  and  development  for  storage  tech-
nologies  and  systems  that  incorporate  a  broad  technology  base  consisting  of  bat-
teries  (both  conventional  and  advanced),  flywheels,  high-energy  density  capacitors,
superconducting  magnetic  energy  storage  (SMES),  power  electronics,  and  control
systems.
Q3. What are the three most important issues that DOE and electric power industry

face in modernizing the existing bulk power transmission system?

A3. The overarching challenges are to strengthen the flow of investment capital into
grid-related improvements, and to focus that flow on the changes that are most ur-
gently needed. To accomplish this, three critical actions are needed:

• The U.S. Congress needs to enact legislation with mandatory and enforceable

reliability standards;

• Collaborative  efforts  are  needed  at  the  regional  level  to  determine  what  the

design characteristics of the region’s next-generation grid should be; and

• While  FERC  has  primary  regulatory  responsibility  for  the  transmission  grid
at  the  federal  level,  DOE  can  work  with  regional  organizations  and  groups
of  states  to  facilitate  regional  transmission  planning  to  identify  the  issues
(both  technical  and  policy)  that  need  to  be  addressed  and  resolved  in  order
for  transmission  grid  investment  to  occur.  Many  institutional  questions  need
to  be  addressed  at  the  regional  level,  such  as  how  the  costs  of  new  facilities
will  be  allocated  across  a  multi-state  region,  how  to  streamline  the  processes
for  determining  whether  a  specific  facility  is  needed,  and  how  regional  siting
protocols are to work.

Questions submitted by Representative Al Green
Q1. Following the Northeastern energy grid blackout in 2003, national attention was
focused  on  enhancing  and  securing  our  electrical  grid  systems.  It  is  my  under-
standing  that  the  Office  of  Electricity  Delivery  and  Energy  Reliability  (OE)  is
the  lead  in  modernizing  such  efforts  with  a  request  of  $95.6  million  for  various
activities.
Can  you  elaborate  more  specifically  on  two  of  the  initiatives,  the  GridWise  and
GridWorks  initiatives  as  well  as  give  me  an  estimate  of  the  budget  for  the  two?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:35 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 020735 PO 00000 Frm 00111 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ENER05\042705\20735 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

108

A1. These  two  new  activities  were  developed  to  better  integrate  advancing  power
technologies into the electric delivery system in order to achieve increased reliability
and  security.  GridWise  develops  real  time  controls,  advanced  communications  and
information  software  technologies  for  electric  distribution  and  end  use.  GridWorks
develops  advanced  hardware  technologies,  including  cables  and  conductors,  sub-
station and protective systems, power electronics, and sensors.

If  we  compare  the  President’s  FY  2005  request  to  the  FY  2006  request,  the  total
amount requested for GridWorks and GridWise is the same (i.e., $10.5 million). This
reflects  the  Administration’s  continued  commitment  to  these  programs,  and  their
potential contribution to the reliability of the electric grid.
Q2. In  the  hearing  you  spoke  of  transferring  technologies  from  the  research  and  de-
velopment  phase  to  actual  implementation  in  the  grid  system.  Could  you  per-
haps  discuss  what  you  feel  a  time  line  for  tech  transfer  should  be,  how  the  OE
budget  should  change  when  it  is  time  for  such  implementation,  and  what  sort
of  delays  we  might  see  from  the  end  of  the  development  phase  to  the  beginning
of the implementation phase?

A2. The time line for implementation strongly depends on the technology. Research
in  high  temperature  superconductivity,  for  example,  has  been  occurring  for  over  a
decade.  However,  it  is  important  that  the  user,  in  our  case  the  utility,  is  involved
in  the  project  during  all  phases—research  and  development,  as  well  as  demonstra-
tion.  This  approach  provides  utilities  with  direct  experience  with  installation  and
operation  of  equipment  as  well  as  gaining  the  advantages  of  their  collaboration  in
designing equipment which will meet their needs and requirements. Often, the more
that  the  utility  has  been  engaged  in  the  project  during  the  early  stages,  the  easier
it  is  to  transition  from  the  development  phase  to  the  demonstration  stage  and  fi-
nally  to  commercial  deployment.  This  is  because  the  utility’s  technological  needs
have  been  taken  into  account,  there  is  an  existing  familiarity  with  the  technology
by  the  user,  and  thus  the  potential  risks  of  integrating  the  new  technologies  into
their system are better understood.
Q3. I  notice  in  your  testimony  that  there  has  been  a  strong  focus,  in  terms  of  fund-
ing,  on  the  President’s  initiatives.  How  much  of  a  role  does  that  play  in  your
request  for  the  funding  of  activities,  and  have  you  found  any  major  divergent
visions between your particular sectors and the Administration’s initiatives?

A3. The  FY  2006  budget  request  for  the  Office  of  Electricity  Delivery  and  Energy
Reliability  will  provide  funding  support  for  activities  which  the  Administration  and
DOE believe will ensure electricity reliability and energy critical infrastructure pro-
tection.
